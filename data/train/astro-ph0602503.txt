    "following cosmological recombination at a redshift @xmath9 , the baryonic gas filling up the universe became predominantly neutral . given that this gas is known to be mostly ionized today",
    ", one arrives at one of the major questions in current extragalactic astronomy , namely , when was the cosmic hydrogen re - ionized , and what were the sources responsible ?",
    "recent observations have begun to provide preliminary answers to this question .",
    "the absorption spectra of sdss quasars at @xmath1 indicate that the neutral fraction of hydrogen increases significantly at @xmath10 ( becker et al . 2001 ; fan et al .",

    "2005 ) . on the other hand , analysis of the first year data from the _ wmap _ satellite suggests a large optical depth to electron scattering @xmath11 , implying that the universe was significantly reionized at redshifts as high as @xmath12 ( kogut et al .  2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "while this result is not surprising in view of earlier calculations of the reionization history by metal - free stars ( e.g. wyithe & loeb 2003a ; cen 2003a ) , it offers an intriguing _ empirical _ path for answering questions regarding the sources of reionization .",
    "several authors have pointed out that the combination of these results can only be reconciled with an extended or multi - peaked reionization history ( wyithe & loeb  2003a , c ; cen 2003a , b ; chiu , fan , & ostriker 2003 ; haiman & holder  2003 ; somerville et al .",
    "2003 ; gnedin 2004 ) .",
    "a common feature of these models is that the first generation of stars plays a significant role .",
    "the first stars in the universe ( pop - iii ) formed out of metal - free gas , relic from the big bang",
    ". simulations of metal - free star formation indicate that the first stars may have high masses ( @xmath13 ) , since gas cooling by molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath14 ) can not lower the gas temperature below @xmath15k ( bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ; abel , bryan & norman 2002 ) .",
    "massive , metal - free stars shine at their eddington luminosity , @xmath16 , and have roughly constant effective ( surface ) temperatures of @xmath17k and lifetimes of @xmath18yr , independent of their mass ( bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "this implies that the number of ionizing photons produced per baryon incorporated into these stars ( @xmath19 ) was independent of their mass function , and larger by more than an order of magnitude than that of the observed population - ii ( pop - ii ) metal - rich stars . as a result",
    ", the emissivity of ionizing photons may be double peaked , leaving open the possibility of an early reionization by pop - iii stars , with an epoch of recombination following enrichment of the igm above the critical threshold , before a final reionization by pop - ii stars near @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , the observed enrichment of the igm is consistent with a substantial contribution from pop - iii stars ( oh , nollett , madau & wasserburg 2001 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it has been suggested that the non - monotonic behavior of these models is due to the assumption of a sharp transition in metallicity ( furlanetto & loeb  2005 ) .",
    "these authors find that the various feedback mechanisms lead to an extended but monotonic reionization history .    in this paper",
    "we develop a model which follows the densities of primordial and enriched gas in collapsed systems , and compute co - dependent sf , reionization and metal enrichment histories . while our model is more detailed than many previous semi - analytic approaches in several respects , the primary qualitative difference is that pop - iii sf is allowed to proceed in gas that had already collapsed in minihalos prior to enrichment of the igm , but which has not formed stars , even when the general igm has been enriched to a high metallicity level .",
    "we motivate the physics of this conclusion , in addition to modeling its consequences for the reionization history .",
    "we show that the additional post enrichment pop - iii sf boosts the total integrated pop - iii sf by an order of magnitude in typical cases .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume cosmological parameters obtained through fits to _ wmap _ data ( spergel et al .",
    "these include density parameter values of @xmath21 in matter , @xmath22 in baryons , @xmath23 in a cosmological constant , and a hubble constant of @xmath24 ( or equivalently @xmath25 ) . for calculations of the press - schechter  ( 1974 )",
    "mass function ( with the modification of sheth & tormen  1999 ) we assume a primordial power - spectrum with a power - law index @xmath26 and the fitting formula to the exact transfer function of cold dark matter , given by bardeen et al .  ( 1986 ) .",
    "we adopt an rms amplitude of @xmath27 for mass density fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath28mpc .",
    "we make the distinction between the ionizing radiation field due to a possible early population of zero - metallicity stars , and the metal enriched stars observed at lower redshifts .",
    "it is thought that the primordial initial mass function favored massive stars ( bromm , copi & larson  1999 , 2001 ; abel , bryan & norman  2000 ; mackey , bromm , hernquist  2002 ) .",
    "the possible existence of this population is very important for reionization because the spectrum of these stars would result in an order of magnitude more ionizing photons per baryon incorporated into stars ( bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ) . the formation of the very massive stars is suppressed as the material out of which stars form is enriched with metals .",
    "the fraction of the ionizing photons produced by metal - free stars depends on several unknown parameters , including the mixing efficiency of metals , the environments in which new stars form , and most importantly , the threshold metallicity above which star formation is transformed from being dominated by massive stars to a scalo  ( 1998 ) initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the threshold metallicity is believed to be small ; bromm et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue for a threshold @xmath29 of the solar metallicity value .",
    "the efficiency of mixing of metal enriched outflows from star forming galaxies to the surrounding igm is even more uncertain ; scannapieco , ferrara & madau  ( 2002 ) and ricotti & ostriker ( 2004 ) find that the mass weighted mean metallicity can reach values greater than @xmath30 of the solar value at redshifts as high as 20 , and note that the average metallicity scales with star formation efficiency , supernova rate , and the fraction of supernova energy that is channeled into outflows . in a representative region of the igm ,",
    "the average metallicity increases roughly exponentially with redshift as it is modulated by the exponential growth in the collapse fraction of baryons at high redshifts .",
    "we therefore define a transition redshift @xmath31 below which metal - rich stars with a scalo  ( 1998 ) imf dominate the production rate of ionizing photons . however , because enrichment will not occur at the same time in all parts of the igm , we allow for a spread in the transition redshift .",
    "we assume a gaussian probability function with variance @xmath32 , so that the fraction of igm @xmath33 that is enriched at redshift @xmath34 is given by @xmath35    the effectiveness of a stellar population in ionizing hydrogen in the igm can be parameterized in terms of the number of ionizing photons produced per baryon incorporated into stars ( @xmath36 ) . throughout the paper",
    "we assume pop - iii stars to be massive ( @xmath37 ) zero - metallicity stars with the generic spectrum calculated by bromm , kudritzki & loeb  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the resulting value is @xmath38 .",
    "we assume metal enriched stars ( 1/20th solar metallicity ) to have a scalo  ( 1998 ) mass - function , and use spectral information from the stellar population model of leitherer et al .",
    "this results in a value of @xmath39 .",
    "throughout the paper we assume that star - formation is initiated through atomic hydrogen cooling , and so implicitly assume the rapid destruction of molecular hydrogen in the igm by a back - ground of uv photons ; molecular hydrogen had been destroyed long before the universe , on average , became significantly ionized ( an ionized fraction of @xmath40 ) ( haiman , rees & loeb  1997 ; oh & haiman  2003 ) . therefore , at the time when the igm started to become enriched to the critical level for pop - ii sf there was significant gas already collapsed in minihalos ( halos above the cosmological jeans mass , but below the minimum mass for sf ) that had virial temperatures which were too low to initiate sf ( see   [ primordev ] ) . if this gas was preserved in its primordial state until sf was initiated through formation of a sufficiently massive system , then the epoch of pop - iii sf could have been increased to redshifts significantly below @xmath31 .",
    "it is often assumed that metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) implies metal enrichment of all gas in the universe ( e.g. , wyithe & loeb 2003a , b ; cen  2003a , b furlanetto & loeb 2005 ) .",
    "we shall point out that this simple assumption is incorrect , which , as we will show , may lead to qualitatively different conclusions with regard to contributions of pop - iii stars to cosmological reionization .",
    "a critical point to note is that metal enrichment process facilitated by shockwaves carrying metals generated in stars is a strong function of the density of the gas that is being enriched . in particular",
    ", we will make the distinction between metal enrichment of the average igm and metal enrichment of gas that is inside already formed halos .",
    "let us consider metal enrichment of gas in minihalos when a blastwave of velocity @xmath41 sweeps through the igm .",
    "this is equivalent to the case of a gas cloud moving through a background medium with velocity @xmath41 .",
    "the gas cloud may be subject to a host of hydrodynamical instabilities , including kelvin - helmholtz and richtmeyer - meshkov instabilities , through which metal mixing occurs .",
    "several authors ( murray et al . 1993 , m93 hereafter ; klein , mckee , & colella 1994 ; dinge 1997 ; miniati et al .",
    "1997 ) have shown that a non - self - gravitating gas cloud moving at the sound speed of the background medium gets disrupted on a time scale of the dynamic time of the cloud .",
    "self - gravity , in our case by the dominant dark matter in a minihalo , could stabilize the gas cloud .",
    "m93 studied the case of self - gravitating , non - cooling gas clouds moving through a background medium in the context of a two - phase medium .",
    "the gas clouds in our minihalos are physically identical to the case considered by m93 in that there is little cooling ( due to lack of cooling agents at the low temperature ) , and the gas cloud is confined by gravitational potential well of the dark matter minihalo .",
    "therefore , we may draw directly upon the calculations by m93 to quantify the whether or not gas clouds in minihalos survive enrichment of the igm .",
    "m93 show both analytically and by simulations that the stability condition for a gas cloud moving through a background medium requires the surface gravity of a cloud to be greater than @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the density ratio of the gas cloud to the background gas , @xmath44 is the radius of the gas cloud .",
    "if we define @xmath45 as @xmath46 then we find that @xmath47 where we have assumed that the density slope near the virial radius is @xmath48 ( navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ) ; @xmath49 is the mass of the minihalo within its virial radius ; @xmath50 is the mass with radius @xmath51 , @xmath34 is redshift . m93",
    "show at @xmath52 only @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the gas is lost after @xmath55 and @xmath56 times the dynamic time of the cloud , which is about the hubble time .",
    "however , they also note that even at @xmath57 , the gas mass loss is still relatively small .    while @xmath41 might be large in the immediate vicinity of a shockwave - producing galaxy",
    ", one does not expect @xmath41 to be large at large distances .",
    "mori , ferrara , & madau ( 2002 ) show , in simulations of propagation of supernova blastwaves from @xmath58 galaxies at @xmath59 , that after more than a hundred million years the relative filling factor for regions being swept by shocks of velocities larger than @xmath60 is roughly @xmath61 .",
    "we expect the velocities to be still smaller at the higher redshifts of concern here , due to enhanced cooling and larger hubble velocity .",
    "we see from equation  ( [ eta ] ) that if @xmath62 @xmath63 of the gas within virialized regions of halos more massive than @xmath64 will have @xmath65 and be relatively un - affected by the shockwaves .",
    "this fraction is reduced to @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . for lower mass mini - halos ( @xmath70 ) close to the jeans mass (   [ massscales ] ) , we find @xmath71 for a smaller velocity of @xmath72 .",
    "however @xmath73 is a high power of the fraction of gas in the halo that is subject to instabilities .",
    "thus even for halos of mass @xmath74 , and winds of velocity @xmath75km / s and @xmath76km / s we find values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 yield @xmath79 . combining these results , we expect that most of the gas already virialized with minihalos will be largely unaffected by metal - carrying blastwaves and remain metal - free until its first episode of starformation .    in addition to direct enrichment , there is the possibility that virialized primordial gas in mini - halos could be enriched during the process of mergers with other mini - halos containing enriched gas .",
    "we do not expect this to be the case for the reasons outlined below .",
    "following the transition redshift , if the blastwaves that carry metals sweep through the igm with a velocity of order of @xmath80  km / s , the igm may be collisionally ionized .",
    "the collisionally heated igm subsequently cools via the compton cooling process ( by the cosmic microwave background ) , and at the same time recombines in the absence ionizing sources .",
    "we find that collisionally ionized gas would be compton - cooled and saturate at a temperature of @xmath81k ( depending on the initial temperature ) after about a hubble time at @xmath82 ; at 1/4 of the hubble time @xmath83",
    "k. hence , igm that is heated at the redshift of interest will not be able to cool below @xmath84  k by radiative processes .",
    "subsequent cooling is primarily due to adiabatic expansion , which could achieve a temperature reduction by a factor of a few for the redshift range of interest . for a igm of @xmath85",
    "k at @xmath82 the jeans mass is @xmath86 , which is close to the threshold mass for atomic cooling ( see equation 7 below ) .",
    "therefore , metal - enriched and heated igm is likely to be prevented from further accreting onto all minihalos , new and old .",
    "thus , gas in collapsed minihalos will not be contaminated by enriched igm gas and will remain metal - free , and newly formed minihalos will be gas - free .    to be extremely conservative ,",
    "let us consider the case where the metal - enriched and heated igm is assumed to have cooled to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "gas from the igm can enter mini - halos with @xmath87m@xmath88 either through mergers of smaller collapsed objects , or through accretion from the igm . in the former case ,",
    "the cold gas content is primordial because accretion from the igm at the temperature of the cosmic microwave background is suppressed in low mass mini - halos . in the latter case",
    "we argue that newly accreted gas into more massive mini - halos is unlikely to be as dense as the gas already at the virial radius .",
    "this may be seen as follows .",
    "an estimate of the non - linear overdensity of baryons inside a virialized object is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the density of baryons inside the virialized object of temperature @xmath91 , and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the background baryon density and temperature respectively ( barkana & loeb  2001 ) . at redshifts below @xmath94 , and in the absence of a heating source the temperature of an adiabatically cooling igm is @xmath95k ( peebles 1993 ) .",
    "this temperature is substantially lower than the temperature of the cosmic microwave background , @xmath96 .",
    "thus primordial gas , which has not been subjected to heating accretes into a dark - matter halo with an initial temperature that is substantially lower than does primordial gas which has been heated by the enriching blast - wave before being compton cooled to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background . from equation  ( [ baryonod ] ) we therefore find that the ratio of overdensities of primordial to enriched gas following virialization is @xmath97 .",
    "this result suggests that in the absence of cooling , enriched gas would be prevented from significantly penetrating the minihalo , so that mixing is expected to be inefficient . as a result primordial gas",
    "is not expected to become contaminated during hierarchical growth of mini - halos .    upon merging to form a system large enough to initiate sf ,",
    "does the primordial gas in mini - halos form stars before becoming enriched by other sf in the galaxy ?",
    "this is expected to happen to some extent .",
    "but  other \" sf that occurred earlier would have been pop - iii sf .",
    "therefore , the question is not whether pop - iii sf will occur or not , but rather what the efficiency of pop - iii formation will be .",
    "we do not have a quantitative answer to this at present .",
    "it seems plausible to expect that the first sf would occur in the largest mass clump in the galaxy .",
    "if the largest mass clump makes up a significant fraction of the total mass of the galaxy , then the overall sf formation efficiency may be largely determined by the sf efficiency within that largest mass clump .",
    "we will therefore assume , following conventional wisdom , that pop - iii sf proceeds with efficiency @xmath98 .    in summary ,",
    "the above discussion leads us to explore the effect of the following hypothesis on the pop - iii sf history , and on the reionization history of cosmic hydrogen .",
    "we assume that virialized primordial gas within mini - halos is not enriched by super - galactic winds .",
    "@xmath100 virialized primordial gas is not enriched following accretion of enriched gas from the igm , or during the mergers of mini - halos .",
    "@xmath101 as a result , primordial virialized gas remains in its primordial state until such time as its host halo grows to be massive enough to initiate a burst of pop - iii sf .",
    "in order to compute the effect of igm enrichment on the sf history , we need to follow the density of enriched and primordial gas through the hierarchical merging of halos . this section introduces a method for following this evolution . during hierarchical galaxy formation , an average property of the galaxy population , such as the density of galaxies evolves in redshift due to newly collapsing halos , mergers of halos and accretion .",
    "we begin by discussing the critical mass - scales in galaxy formation .",
    "we then discuss calculation of the rate of newly collapsing halos , before describing how this quantity , along with the merger rates of galaxies can be used as source and sink terms in differential equations that describe the average evolution of the gas content of the galaxy population .",
    "there are four critical mass scales affecting galaxy formation .",
    "the first is the jeans mass , which corresponds to the smallest mass halo into which gas can accrete from the igm . by considering the response of a baryonic overdensity to the potential well of a dark - matter halo one can find the mass scale at which the baryonic overdensity reaches 100 .",
    "we take this mass scale to represent the jeans mass ( barkana & loeb  2001 ) @xmath102    the second mass scale corresponds to the virial temperature above which gas that has accreted into a halo can cool efficiently .",
    "we assume this scale to be determined by atomic cooling , and so to correspond to a virial temperature below @xmath103k .",
    "the corresponding mass is therefore @xmath104 where @xmath105^{-1}$ ] , @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( see barkana & loeb  2001 for more details ) .",
    "the third mass scale becomes important following the reionization of a region of igm at which time it is heated to @xmath108k .",
    "the jeans mass is increased by several orders of magnitude , and numerical simulations find that gas infall is suppressed in halos with @xmath109 .",
    "there is some disagreement as to the exact value of the halo circular velocity below which gas infall is completely suppressed ( e.g. thoul & weinberg  1996 ; kitayama & ikeuchi  2000 ; quinn , katz & efstathiou  1996 , weinberg , hernquist & katz  1997 ; navarro & steinmetz  1997 ; dijkstra , haiman , rees & weinberg  2004 ) . in what follows",
    "we assume a post - reionization minimum temperature of @xmath110 , and note that the assumption of a smaller temperature will not qualitatively effect our conclusions .",
    "thus we have @xmath111    finally , the fourth characteristic mass is the non - linear mass - scale ( @xmath112 ) , which corresponds to the co - moving length scale @xmath113 over which typical fluctuations ( i.e. 1-sigma fluctuations ) in the linear density field have a value of @xmath114 . here",
    "@xmath115 is the co - moving density of matter , @xmath116 is the linearly extrapolated overdensity at the time of collapse for a dark matter halo , and @xmath117 is the growth factor at redshift @xmath34 . for the cosmology employed in this paper , and at redshifts @xmath118 , a good fit to the dependence of the non - linear mass scale on redshift is given by @xmath119}.\\ ] ] from equation  ( [ nl ] ) we see that @xmath112 moves through the jeans mass at @xmath120 , and the mass corresponding to the hydrogen cooling threshold ( @xmath121 ) at @xmath122 .",
    "the non - linear mass - scale corresponds to the typical mass of newly forming galaxies .",
    "equation  ( [ nl ] ) therefore encapsulates the reason why reionization is expected to occur at redshifts between @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "reionization is a self - limiting process because the non - linear mass - scale does not reach @xmath125 until @xmath126 .",
    "prior to the enrichment of the igm with metals produced by the first stars the gas content of collapsed systems below the critical threshold for sf ( minihalos ) was metal - free .",
    "systems above the critical threshold had an initial burst of metal - free sf , but then presumably became enriched internally so that subsequent sf was metal enriched . following enrichment of the igm to a metallicity above a critical value , gas that was newly accreted from the igm was enriched , and so resulted in pop - ii sf . however , the metal - free gas in minihalos would not have been enriched and would have moved through mergers into larger systems .",
    "when this metal - free gas became part of a galaxy above the sf threshold , further pop - iii sf would have been possible , even significantly after the igm became enriched . indeed ,",
    "if one calculates the collapsed fraction of gas in galaxies at @xmath82 with masses above the jeans mass , to the collapsed fraction above the mass corresponding to the minimum for sf ( @xmath121 ) one finds that the collapsed fraction differs by a factor of 20 !",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the ratio of collapsed fractions above @xmath121 and the jeans mass as a function of redshift .",
    "the majority of metal - free gas that has accreted into collapsed systems at the time of enrichment has not yet formed stars . as a result",
    "the time of enrichment may not correspond to the time when pop - iii sf ends .",
    "indeed the fraction of the pop - iii sf during the history of the universe that has taken place by the transition redshift could be as low as the ratio shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we therefore expect most pop - iii sf to take place at redshifts below @xmath31 .      to follow the evolution of primordial gas in a hierarchical cosmology we first need to compute the collapse rate of new halos . let @xmath127 be the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function ( number of halos with mass between @xmath128 and @xmath129 per co - moving mpc@xmath130 ) of dark - matter halos at redshift @xmath34 .",
    "the rate of change of the density of dark matter halos between @xmath128 and @xmath129 is therefore @xmath131 .",
    "let us also define ( lacey & cole  1993 ) @xmath132 the number of mergers per unit time of halos of mass @xmath133 with halos of mass @xmath128 ( forming new halos of mass @xmath134 ) at redshift @xmath34 .",
    "we find the component of the change in density with redshift of halos having masses between @xmath128 and @xmath129 that is not due to mergers .",
    "this is given by the overall change in the density of halos with mass @xmath128 , minus the change in density due to merger of halos to form a new halo of mass @xmath128 , plus the change in density of halos of mass @xmath128 that merge with other halos .",
    "the collapse rate of new halos may be written @xmath135 the value of @xmath136 equals the net change in density due to newly collapsed halos of mass @xmath128 .",

    "finally , the parameter @xmath296 is unspecified a - priori .",
    "we have chosen @xmath297 , with the exception of figures  [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] .",
    "comparison of figures  [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] with figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] demonstrate that while the details of the reionization history depend on the value assumed for @xmath236 , the qualitative nature of the predicted histories and the values of @xmath280 are similar .",
    "we therefore find that our conclusions are not sensitive to the choice of @xmath236 .",
    "we find that either pop - iii stars substantially reionize the universe , or that the fraction of pop - iii sf which takes place following the transition redshift is large . either way the conclusion is that pop - iii stars played a major role in the reionization history of the universe",
    ". in particular if the universe did not become substantially reionized prior to @xmath31 , then the large majority of pop - iii sf takes place at redshifts below @xmath31 , in contrast to previous modeling .",
    "each of the histories shown in figures  [ fig4]-[fig9 ] was chosen so that overlap occurs at @xmath298 as suggested by the spectra of high redshift sdss quasars . however , different reionization histories result in different densities of electrons as a function of redshift .",
    "the values of @xmath280 for the various models are listed in the middle right panels of figures  [ fig4]-[fig9 ] and in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "wmap suggested @xmath299 .",
    "we see that only a small value of @xmath300 for case - a , or @xmath301 for case - b is required to obtain this large optical depth , even where the enrichment of the igm occurred at a redshift as high as @xmath153 .",
    "indeed the conclusion that pop - iii stars contributed significantly to reionization is quite insensitive to the transition redshift for @xmath302 , so long as pop - iii stars had a top - heavy imf .    the lower three panels of figures  [ fig4]-[fig9 ] represent results for a series of reionization histories . for each value of the primordial escape fraction ( @xmath266 )",
    ", we have found the value of @xmath267 that results in a final overlap at @xmath285 ( or as near as possible at @xmath291 ) , and which maintains the reionization until the present day . in the lower left panel",
    "we present grey - scale and contours showing the level of overlap as a function of redshift and @xmath266 .",
    "the grey - scale shows the level of ionization ( with black representing high ionization ) .",
    "the dotted , dashed and solid lines correspond to @xmath303 , 0.5 and .999 respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath267 corresponding to these histories is plotted as a function of @xmath266 in the middle panel . in the right panel",
    "we plot the optical depth @xmath280 as a function of @xmath266 ( grey line ) . for case - a , the optical depth has a maximum near @xmath304 , but the wmap result is consistent with all values of @xmath266 . for case - b",
    ", the optical depth has a maximum near @xmath305 .",
    "only larger values of @xmath266 are consistent with the wmap result for case - b .",
    "the dark line in the lower - right panel is the ratio of the amount of pop - iii sf already completed at @xmath31 to the total pop - iii sf .",
    "this ratio is small ( @xmath306 ) for small values of @xmath280 . in case - a , we find that the ratio can be as small as 0.01 where @xmath153 and 0.1 where @xmath151 .",
    "the ratio is only of order unity if @xmath266 is also of order unity . in case - b , we find that the ratio can be even smaller , with values a factor of 3 lower",
    ". the ratio does note become of order unity for any value of @xmath266 in case - b .",
    "interestingly in case - a a range of histories show two epochs of reionization .",
    "however , contrary to earlier works , the tail end of the first reionization has not been set by an abrupt transition redshift @xmath31 .",
    "rather the end of the first reionization can come either before , or after @xmath31 depending on the sum of the various astrophysics included in the model .",
    "a particularly interesting history is seen where case - a sf is combined with a large escape fraction for pop - iii ionizing photons and a large transition redshift ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) . in this example",
    "the reionization history shows three peaks of reionization .",
    "thus , the claim made earlier by furlanetto & loeb ( 2005 ) that a temporally smooth metallicity enrichment of the igm gives rise to only monotonic reionization process is not borne out in our more detailed calculations in general .",
    "clearly , the information embedded in the reionization history is very rich .",
    "it is useful to extract some essential properties with regard to the cmb experiments such as wmap , since the three - year wmap results are expected to be made public shortly .",
    "the thin black curves in figures  [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] show histories with @xmath307 and @xmath308 respectively .",
    "these histories follow from a very small pop - iii contribution to reionization , suggesting that without pop - iii contribution we expect @xmath2 . at the other extreme ,",
    "when we maximize the contribution from pop - iii stars to reionization by using a very high ( perhaps implausible ) escape fraction ( relative to that of pop - ii stars ) , a maximum value of @xmath5 is possible .",
    "this suggests that the optical depth reported by the three - year wmap results should not exceed this value ( which is @xmath309 above the central value of the first year wmap result ) , otherwise our understanding of structure formation at high redshift would require a dramatic revision",
    ". in a more realistic picture where the product of star formation efficiency and escape fraction for pop - iii stars is comparable to that for pop - ii stars , we find that the range @xmath6 is most likely , consistent with our previous calculations ( cen 2003a , b ) .",
    "the three different outcomes described above imply qualitatively different histories .",
    "in the small @xmath2 case without significant pop - iii contribution , reionization is expected to be rapid with the neutral fraction quickly rising above @xmath3 at @xmath4 . in the large @xmath310 case with a large pop - iii contribution",
    ", the reionization process could be complex and frequently displays multiple peaks . under seemingly more reasonable assumptions regarding the efficiency of pop - iii stars",
    ", there appears to be a reionization plateau at @xmath7 where the mean neutral fraction holds in a relatively narrow range of @xmath311 .",
    "independent constraints of the reionization history are highly desirable . surveys of ly@xmath312 emitters ( e.g. , malhotra & rhoads 2005 ) and measurements of qso stromgren sphere sizes ( e.g. , mesinger , haiman , & cen 2004 ; wyithe , loeb & carilli  2005 ; fan et al  2005 ) may provide powerful constraints on the evolution of the ionized fraction close to the end of the reionization epoch .",
    "in addition future cmb experiments such as planck survey might be able to distinguish ( e.g. , holder et al .",
    "2003 ) between the various histories and if so , it should yield some critical information on sf processes in the high redshift universe .",
    "we show that the collapsed fraction of primordial gas that is trapped in virialized minihalos at the redshift ( @xmath31 ) when the igm becomes enriched with metals is larger than the collapsed fraction of gas that has already been involved in sf by a factor of a few to a few tens .",
    "we argue that this virialized gas will not be as easily enriched by super - galactic winds as the general igm , because the strong self - gravity created by dark matter and significant overdensity with respect to the background gas help stabilize the collapsed gas against large disruptions by sweeping shockwaves .",
    "moreover , enriched gas is expected to have been pre - heated during the process of enrichment , preventing contamination of virialized primordial gas during hierarchical growth of mini - halos .",
    "hence , collapsed gas in virialized minihalos may largely remain metal - free , until those halos merge to form larger systems of sufficient mass to initiate sf .",
    "we have followed the evolution of virialized primordial gas through hierarchical mergers of their host dark matter halos .",
    "this enables the calculation of the pop - iii sf rate arising from the virialized primordial gas when it crosses the hydrogen cooling threshold .",
    "our model for the reionization of the igm computes the co - evolution of the reionization and sf histories .",
    "in addition to following the gas - content of halos below the minimum mass for sf our model addresses several astrophysical phenomena .",
    "these include feedback from reionization in the form of suppression of galaxy formation in a photo - ionized igm , as well as the photo - evaporation of minihalos ( both the screening of ionizing sources and the additional low mass sf in ionized regions prior to photo - evaporation ) .",
    "we also allow the igm to be gradually enriched by metals rather than an abrupt transition .",
    "we find that the pop - iii sf rate peaks substantially later ( as low as redshift @xmath313 ) in cosmic time than the epoch at which the igm became metal enriched , and may extend to @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we find that the total integrated pop - iii sf is larger , by a factor of a few to a few tens , than the integrated pop - iii sf at the average redshift of igm metal enrichment .",
    "this prolonged epoch of pop - iii sf has a pronounced effect on the reionization history of cosmic hydrogen . despite the varied feedback mechanisms included in our model we find that the prolonged epoch of pop - iii sf leads to complex reionization histories which can be multi - peaked under a range of plausible scenarios .",
    "observational measurements of the detailed reionization history would provide critical information on the formation process of first stars . specifically , assuming the final overlap redshift to be fixed at @xmath285 ( as implied by observations of high redshift quasars ) , the contribution of pop - iii stars to reionization can be quantified and will be tested by three - year wmap results : ( 1 ) if pop - iii stars do not contribute to reionization , @xmath2 and a rapid reionization at @xmath1 is expected , with the mean neutral fraction quickly exceeding @xmath3 at @xmath4 ; ( 2 ) if the product of star formation efficiency and escape fraction for pop - iii stars is significantly larger than for pop - ii stars , then a maximum @xmath5 is achievable ; ( 3 ) in a ( perhaps ) more plausible scenario where the product of star formation efficiency and escape fraction for pop - iii stars is comparable to that for pop - ii stars , @xmath6 would be observed [ consistent with our previous calculations ( cen  2003a , b ) ] . in this case",
    "the histories would be characterized by an extended ionization plateau from @xmath7 where the mean neutral fraction stays in a narrow range of @xmath8 .",
    "these results are rather insensitive to the redshift where the igm becomes enriched with metals ."
