    "societies exhibit significant homophily and segregation patterns .",
    "how do such biases in interactions affect the adoption of products , contagion of diseases , spread of ideas , and other diffusion processes ?",
    "for example , how does the diffusion of a new product that is more attractive to one age group depend on the interaction patterns across age groups ?",
    "how does the answer depend on the differences in preferences of such groups , their relative sociabilities , and biases in the interactions ?",
    "we answer these questions by analyzing a general model of diffusion that incorporates a variety of previous models as special cases , including contagion processes studied in the epidemiology literature such as the so - called sis model ( e.g. , bailey 1975 , pastor - satorrs and vespignani , 2001 ) , as well as interactions with strategic complementarities , such as in the game theoretic literature and network games ( e.g. , galeotti et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "our model incorporates types of individuals who have different preferences or proclivities for adoption , as well as biases in interactions across types .",
    "in particular , we examine whether or not diffusion occurs from a very small introduction of an activity in a heterogeneous and homophilous society .",
    "we first concentrate on the focal situation with only two types of agents . within this case",
    ", the most interesting scenario turns out to be one where one type would foster diffusion and the other would not if the types were completely segregated . in that scenario",
    ", we show that homophily actually facilitates diffusion , so that having types biased in interactions towards their own types can enhance diffusion to a significant fraction of both types . having a higher rate of homophily , so that a group is more introspective , allows the diffusion to get started within the group that would foster diffusion on its own .",
    "this can then generate the critical mass necessary to diffuse the behavior to the wider society .",
    "in contrast , societies exhibiting less homophily can fail to foster diffusion from small initial seeds .",
    "we then move to the general case of many types .",
    "our main characterization theorem generalizes the features from the two - agent case , showing that diffusion relates to a condition on the largest eigenvalue of an interaction matrix which tracks the initial adoption rates of various types of individuals , that is , their adoption rates from small initial seeds .",
    "again , we show that homophily can facilitate diffusion , showing that a sufficient condition is that some type ( or group of types ) that would adopt on its own is sufficiently homophilous to give the diffusion a toehold .",
    "we discuss how this extends the intuitions from the case of two types .",
    "to fix ideas and preview some of the insights from the general model , we begin with a case where there are just two types of agents and the contagion follows a simple and well - studied process .    in particular , consider an infectious disease spreading in a population with two groups : the young and the old .",
    "our aim is to analyze whether or not diffusion of the disease occurs .",
    "that is , if we start with a small seed of infected agents , will the infection spread to a significant fraction of both populations and become endemic ? in order to answer this question consider the following heterogeneous version of the canonical sis model .",
    "agents can be in one of two states : infected or susceptible .",
    "a susceptible agent becomes infected at an independent probability @xmath0 from each interaction with an infected agent .",
    "conversely , with a probability @xmath1 per unit of time an infected individual recovers and becomes susceptible again .",
    "the crucial parameter of the model is the relative spreading rate , @xmath2 , which measures how infectious the disease is in terms of how easy it is to contract compared to the rate at which one recovers .",
    "an interesting case for our analysis is one where the population is heterogeneous in terms of the proclivities for getting infected . in particular , imagine that the older are more ( or less ) vulnerable to the disease than the young .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath3 is the spreading rate of the young and @xmath4 of the old , then we allow @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to their age , individuals are also potentially differentiated by the rates at which they interact with other individuals , where `` interact '' is taken to mean that they have a meeting with an individual which could transmit the infection if one of them is infected and the other is susceptible .",
    "in particular , apart from his or her type , each individual is characterized by a degree @xmath6 ; the number of agents the individual meets ( and is potentially infected by ) every period .",
    "let @xmath7 be the degree distribution of individuals of type @xmath8 ; that is , the fraction of agents of type @xmath8 that have @xmath6 meetings per unit of time .    also ,",
    "for the purposes of this example , we stick with what is standard in the random network literature , and take the meeting process to be proportionally biased by degree .",
    "thus , conditional on meeting an agent of type @xmath8 , the probability that he or she is of degree @xmath6 is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the average degree among type @xmath8 agents ( @xmath11 ) .    to capture homophily ,",
    "let @xmath12 be the probability that a given type @xmath8 agent ( old or young ) meets his or her own type , and @xmath13 be the probability of meeting an agent of the other type .",
    "for example if the populations are of even size , then having @xmath14 means that agents are mixing with their own type disproportionately .",
    "we say that diffusion occurs from a small seed ( with a formal definition below ) if starting from an arbitrarily small amount of infected individuals ( of either type ) , we end up with a nontrivial steady - state infection rate among the population .",
    "let @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "[ the - one ] diffusion occurs from a small seed in the two type sis model if and only if one of the following holds :    \\1 ) @xmath17 or    \\2 ) @xmath18 and @xmath19    the proof of the theorem appears in the appendix , and is a special case of our more general results below .",
    "the condition for diffusion in the standard ( homogeneous ) sis model is @xmath20 ( e.g. , pastor - satorrs and vespignani , 2001 ) .",
    "thus , we see how this generalizes in the above theorem .",
    "theorem [ the - one ] yields the following straightforward consequences .",
    "[ cor - one ] the following statements hold for the two - type sis model :    \\1 ) if diffusion occurs within each type when isolated ( when @xmath21 ) , then it would also occur when there is interaction among the two ( when @xmath22 ) .",
    "\\2 ) if diffusion does not occur in either of the types when isolated , then it would not occur when there is interaction among the two .",
    "\\3 ) if diffusion occurs among one type but not the other when isolated , then it will occur among the whole population if the homophily is high enough .",
    "the most interesting scenario turns out is the last one , such that one of the types would foster diffusion if isolated , whereas the other would not ( i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . in that scenario , homophily either plays no role ( that is , when @xmath17 ) so that any homophily level will allow diffusion , or else it actually facilitates diffusion ( that is , when @xmath18 in which case @xmath25 must exceed @xmath26 ) .    in the latter case diffusion",
    "occurs only if the two types are sufficiently biased in interactions towards their own types ( i.e. , @xmath25 is sufficiently large ) .",
    "the intuition for such a result is the following . having a higher rate of homophily ,",
    "so that a group is more introspective , allows the diffusion to get started within the group that would foster diffusion on its own . in turn , it can then spread to the wider society .",
    "with this introduction behind us , we now describe the general model .",
    "each agent is characterized by his or her degree @xmath27 and type @xmath28 .",
    "since the number of individuals of each type can differ , let @xmath29 be the fraction of individuals of type @xmath8 .",
    "an agent s degree @xmath6 indicates the number of other agents that the agent meets ( and is potentially influenced by ) before making a decision in a given period .",
    "the meeting process is allowed to be directional ; i.e. , agent @xmath30 meeting ( paying attention to ) agent @xmath31 does not necessarily imply that @xmath32 pays attention to @xmath30 .",
    "so , although we use the term `` meeting , '' the interaction need not be reciprocal .",
    "of course , a special case is one where the interaction is mutual .",
    "different types may have different distributions in terms of how frequently they meet other agents .",
    "in particular , let @xmath7 be the degree distribution of individuals of type @xmath8 .",
    "that is , @xmath7 is the fraction of type @xmath8 individuals who have @xmath6 meetings per period .",
    "thus , there can be heterogeneity among agents of a given type , in terms of how social they are .    an agent s type @xmath8 shapes both the agent s relative interaction rates with other types of agents and the agent s preferences or proclivity for infection . in particular , @xmath33 is the probability that an agent of type @xmath8 meets an agent of type @xmath34 in any given meeting .",
    "clearly , @xmath35 .",
    "the bias in meetings across types is then summarized by the matrix @xmath36    we assume that @xmath37 is a primitive matrix ( so that @xmath38 for some @xmath39 ) .",
    "this ensures that there is at least some possibility for an infection that starts in one group to reach any other , as otherwise there are some groups that are completely insulated from some others .      in order to study this system",
    "analytically , we examine a continuum of agents , @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "this continuum is partitioned into agents of different types , and then within types , by their degrees .",
    "there are two ways in which the meeting process can be biased : by type and by degree .    in particular , as mentioned above , the relative proportion of a type @xmath8 agent s meetings with type @xmath34 is described by the term @xmath41 , which captures relative biases in meetings across types .",
    "so , in a given period , an agent of type @xmath8 with degree @xmath6 expects to meet @xmath42 agents of type @xmath34 .",
    "those agents are randomly selected from the agents among type @xmath34 .",
    "we also allow the meeting process to be biased by degree .",
    "the probability that an agent meets an agent of degree @xmath6 out of those of type @xmath34 is given by @xmath43if there is no weighting by degree , then an agent equally samples all agents of type @xmath34 and @xmath44 .",
    "this would require a directed meeting process , such that an agent observes members of a given type uniformly at random , independently of their meeting process or sociability .",
    "if instead , meetings are proportional to how social the agents of type @xmath34 are , then @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the average degree among type @xmath34 agents .",
    "this latter condition covers cases in which meetings are reciprocal .",
    "our formulation also allows for other cases . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath47 for all @xmath34 and @xmath6 such that @xmath48 .      in each period",
    "an agent is in one of two states @xmath49 .",
    "either the agent has adopted the behavior and are in state @xmath50 ( active , adopted , infected ... ) , or they have not adopted the behavior and are in state @xmath51 ( passive , non - adopter , susceptible ... ) .",
    "the agents actions are influenced by the actions of others , but in a stochastic manner .",
    "agents are heterogeneous with respect to their proclivities to adopt the behavior .",
    "a passive agent of type @xmath8 adopts the behavior at a rate described by a function @xmath52 , where @xmath6 is the agent s degree ( number of meetings per unit of time ) and @xmath53 is the number of agents whom she meets who have adopted the behavior .",
    "( details of the dynamics will be given below . ) the reverse process , by which an active agent of type @xmath8 becomes passive happens at a rate described by a function @xmath54 .",
    "the functions @xmath52 and @xmath54 are the primitives of the diffusion process and are assumed to satisfy some basic conditions :    a1 : :    @xmath55 for each @xmath8 and    @xmath6 : a passive agent can not become active unless she meets    at least one active agent .",
    "a2 : :    @xmath52 is non - decreasing function in    @xmath53 : the adoption rate is non - decreasing in the number of    active agents met .",
    "a3 : :    @xmath56 for each @xmath8 and some    @xmath6 such that @xmath57 .",
    "this condition    implies that for each type of agent there exists some degree such that    the rate of adoption for agents with such a degree is positive when    they meet at least one active agent .",
    "a4 : :    @xmath58 for each @xmath8 and    @xmath6 : it is possible to return from active to passive when    all agents met are passive .",
    "a5 : :    @xmath54 is non - increasing in @xmath53 : the    transition rate from active to passive is non - increasing in the number    of active agents met .",
    "this general model of diffusion admits a number of different models , including models based on best - response dynamics of various games ( with trembles ) as well as epidemiological models . here",
    "are a few prominent examples of processes that are admitted :    * susceptible - infected - susceptible ( * sis diffusion process * ) : @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 . * myopic - best response dynamics by agents who care about the _ relative _ play of neighbors ( * relative threshold diffusion process * ) : @xmath63 if @xmath64 and @xmath65 otherwise . also @xmath60 if @xmath66 and @xmath67 otherwise , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath68 $ ] . * myopic - best response dynamics by agents who care about the _ aggregate _ play of neighbors ( * aggregate threshold diffusion process * )",

    ", we analyze a continuous time dynamic , where at any given time @xmath76 the state of the system consists of a partition of the set of agents in `` active '' and `` passive . ''    as is standard in the literature , we study the continuous system as an analytically tractable alternative to the stochastic discrete system .",
    "let @xmath77 denote the frequency of active agents at time @xmath39 among those of type @xmath8 with degree @xmath6 .",
    "thus , @xmath78is the frequency of active agents at time @xmath39 among those of type @xmath8 , and @xmath79is the overall fraction of active agents in the population at time @xmath39 .",
    "the adoption dynamics are described as follows:@xmath80where @xmath81 is the rate at which a passive agent of type @xmath8 and with degree @xmath6 becomes active , whereas @xmath81 stands for the reverse transition .",
    "in order to compute these transition rates we must calculate first the probability that an agent of type @xmath8 has of sampling an active agent .",
    "denote this probability by @xmath82 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath83    given @xmath82 then @xmath84and@xmath85    a _ steady - state _ is when @xmath86 , which implies that we can write the steady state level @xmath77 as being independent of time . solving from equation (",
    "[ rho - id ] ) leads to the following necessary condition @xmath87    if we specify the rates @xmath82 for each type @xmath8 , then this determines the rates of transition under ( [ rates ] ) .",
    "this in turn , leads to a level of @xmath88 for each @xmath89 under ( [ rho - equilibrium ] ) that would have to hold in equilibrium , which in turn determines the rates at which active agents would be met under @xmath82 .",
    "thus , replacing equation ( [ rho - equilibrium ] ) in equation ( [ two ] ) we find that a steady state equilibrium corresponds to a fixed point calculation as follows : @xmath90where @xmath91    the previous system of equations implicitly characterizes the steady states of the dynamics , since by solving for @xmath92 we can easily find the fraction of adopters of each type @xmath93 and ultimately the overall fraction of adopters @xmath94 .",
    "we now consider the following question which is the central focus of our analysis : if we start with a small fraction of adopters , would the behavior spread to a significant fraction of the population(s ) ?",
    "in other words , we determine the conditions that lead to the diffusion of a new behavior to a significant fraction of the population when there is a small initial perturbation of an initial state in which nobody is infected or has adopted the behavior ; so starting from @xmath95 .    thus , in what follows we explore the behavior of the system of ( [ equ ] ) near @xmath96 ; in order to see conditions under which it is a _ stable _ steady - state .",
    "the system of equations described in ( [ equ ] ) can be approximated by a linear system in the neighborhood of @xmath96 as follows : @xmath97 where @xmath98    as we show in the appendix , filling in for the expressions of @xmath99 , we can rewrite @xmath100 as @xmath101where @xmath102    the term @xmath103 is a nicely interpretable factor .",
    "it is the relative growth in infection for due to type @xmath8 , but adjusted by the relative rates at which type @xmath8 s will be met by other agents ( so weighted by degrees according to @xmath104 ) .",
    "note that if when we start with some vector of @xmath105 s near @xmath106 ( so our approximation is correct ) , but with positive entries , and then we end up with a new vector that is at least as large as the starting vector , then it must be that @xmath106 is an _ unstable _ solution .",
    "there is diffusion from a small seed if and only if for any small @xmath107 , there exists some @xmath108 such that @xmath109 for all @xmath8 and @xmath110 .",
    "thus , diffusion from a small seed requires that beginning any small fraction of initial adopters the `` dynamics '' lead to a larger fraction of adopters .",
    "we remark that if 0 is unstable relative to some small initial seed @xmath111 , then it is unstable relative to any small initial seed @xmath112 .",
    "that is , if @xmath113 , then for any @xmath112 there is some @xmath39 such that @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , if there is no diffusion with a particular small initial distribution , then there will be no diffusion with any other initial distribution .",

    ". therefore , diffusion occuring within each type when isolated corresponds to having @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "those conditions in turn establish part 1 ) of the corollary as a consequence of part 1 ) of theorem [ the - two ] . if , on the contrary , diffusion does not occur among either of the types when isolated , then @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "straightforward calculations show that then the condition for diffusion stated in part 2 ) of theorem [ the - two ] can not satisfied for any value of @xmath125 .",
    "the last part of the corollary follows vacuously if @xmath126 , and otherwise diffusion occurs if @xmath127 exceeds @xmath128 , establishing the claim .",

    "we can now state the following result , which generalizes the two - type result to many types .",
    "[ char ] diffusion occurs if and only if the largest eigenvalue of @xmath100 ( denoted by @xmath132 ) is larger than @xmath133 .",

    "\\4 ) if there is a subset of types @xmath135 such that @xmath136 for each @xmath137 , then there is diffusion from a small seed .",
    "we first explain why 1 ) holds , as 2 ) is a simple variation .",
    "if diffusion occurs within each type when isolated then @xmath138 for all @xmath8 and therefore @xmath139it follows that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath100 is larger than @xmath133 ( since the right - hand side matrix is a stochastic matrix and thus has a largest eigenvalue of 1 ) , and the result then follows from theorem [ char ] .",
    "next let us explain why 3 ) and 4 ) are true , and then discuss the intuition .",
    "3 ) is clearly a special case of 4 ) , so let us discuss why 4 ) is true .",
    "given that @xmath136 for each @xmath137 , it follows that for any positive vector @xmath140 : @xmath141_i$ ] is greater than @xmath142 for each @xmath137 .",

    "then @xmath144 and so the eigenvalue is larger than 1 .",
    "\\1 ) and 2 ) of the corollary are fairly intuitive results .",
    "note that in case of just one population , then @xmath138 is the condition that characterizes instability of ( diffusion from ) no activity .",
    "thus , if all populations are such that they would experience diffusion from a small seed if isolated , then regardless of the interaction pattern there will be diffusion ; and similarly if none of them would experience diffusion in isolation , then there can not be diffusion when they interact .",
    "the less obvious cases are 3 ) and 4 ) , which show that if some type or group of types has enough interaction with itself to get diffusion going , then diffusion among the entire population will occur .",
    "again , these emphasize the role of homophily in enabling diffusion ( infection ) from a small seed : if there is some group of types that interacts within itself in a manner sufficient to enable diffusion among that group , then a toehold can be established and diffusion will occur from a small seed .",
    "another corollary is that if populations are similar so that they have the same infection properties near 0 ( i.e. , @xmath145 for all @xmath8 and @xmath34 ) , then diffusion properties are determined by whether this growth rate is bigger or smaller than 1 .",
    "[ cor - similar ] if @xmath145 for all @xmath8 and @xmath34 , then there is diffusion from a small seed if and only if @xmath120 .",
    "this corollary then emphasizes that in order for the homophily and particular patterns of interaction to matter , it must be that types are not just heterogeneous in their interaction ( the @xmath37 matrix ) , but also in their adoption / infection proclivities .",
    "if they all have similar adoption / infection proclivities , then the particular details of who interacts with whom do not affect diffusion from a small seed .",
    "the proof of this corollary is straightforward .",
    "note that @xmath146it follows that the largest eigenvalue of @xmath100 is larger than @xmath133 if and only if @xmath120 since @xmath147 is a stochastic matrix and has a maximum eigenvalue of @xmath133 .",
    "the less obvious cases are thus such that there are some types who would experience diffusion on their own , while others would not . then the interaction patterns really matter and , as already illustrated for the two - type case , some subtle conditions ensue .",
    "a sufficient condition again is that there is sufficient homophily such that infection can take hold within some type , and then it can spread among the population , but more complicated patterns among a number of groups can also possibly lead to diffusion from a small seed .",
    "the focus of most of the related literature has been on analyzing the effect that the degree distribution has on diffusion in social networks ( see e.g. , jackson and rogers , 2007 , lpez - pintado , 2008 , galeotti and goyal , 2009 , galeotti et al . , 2010 . ) .",
    "this paper , however , focuses on the effect of homophily , something which despite its importance has received little attention in the diffusion literature .",
    "one of the few exceptions is the paper by golub and jackson ( 2010 ) which also studies the impact of homophily on some ( very different ) learning and diffusion processes .",
    "there are important differences between our approach and theirs . on the one hand ,",
    "the diffusion processes analyzed are not the same ; we focus on what can be thought of as generalizations of the sis infection model , whereas golub and jackson ( 2010 ) analyze models of diffusion based either on shortest paths communication , random walks or linear updating processes .",
    "second , the paper by golub and jackson ( 2010 ) studies the convergence time to the steady state , whereas we analyze whether there is or not convergence to a state with a positive fraction of adopters .    as a first step to understanding the effect of homophily on diffusion , in this paper we have concentrated on a specific question ; namely the spreading of a new behavior when starting with a small initial seed .",
    "a central insight here is that homophily can facilitate infection or contagion .",
    "nevertheless , there are other issues which are left for further work . for example",
    ", one could evaluate the size of the adoption endemic state as a function of the homophily level .",
    "there homophily might have conflicting effects : although it can facilitate an initial infection , it might be that an increase in homophily can also lead to a decrease in the overall infection rate .",
    "indeed , the eventual fraction of adopters attained in the steady state might depend on the homophily level in complicated ways .",
