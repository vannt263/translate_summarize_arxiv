    "however , quantum field theory itself contains mechanisms to limit the extent of negative energy densities : certain weighted averages of the stress - energy tensor obey state - independent lower bounds known as quantum weak energy inequalities ( qwei ) [ or simply quantum inequalities ( qi ) ] which severely limit exotic phenomena such as those described above .",
    "bounds of this type have been obtained by various means  @xcite for the scalar , electromagnetic and proca fields , in both flat and curved spacetimes , leading to results of great generality . taking four - dimensional minkowski space as a specific example , and averaging the energy density along an inertial worldline , the qwei satisfied by these three theories",

    "the other , due to fewster and verch  @xcite , establishes the existence of qewis for dirac and majorana fields of arbitrary mass in general four - dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes by drawing on techniques from microlocal analysis .",
    "however , this approach did not lead to an explicit formula for the qwei bound , so its magnitude  even in four - dimensional minkowski space  has not previously been determined  .",
    "( specific classes of dirac states with local negative energy densities have been studied  @xcite and shown , in the massless limit , to satisfy the scalar field qwei obtained in  @xcite ; of course , this does not amount to a proof of the qweis . ) thus , for example , it has not previously been clear whether or not it is more or less easy to support a traversable wormhole using dirac fields , rather than with the scalar or electromagnetic fields .    in this paper , we present a new qwei derivation for dirac fields , which combines ideas taken from  @xcite with an approach first developed for the scalar field in  @xcite . the argument is straightforward , involving the use of anticommutation relations and an identity for fourier transforms , and yields an explicit , closed - form , bound . in four - dimensional minkowski space",

    "we now proceed to calculate the right - hand side of eq .   and show that it is finite . inserting the definition eq .",

    "using the translational invariance of the theory to move from a worldline @xmath50 to @xmath87 , we have therefore established the bound @xmath88 for any @xmath89 , where @xmath90 as claimed in the introduction .",
    "this bound is clearly finite for any smooth compactly supported @xmath2 , as @xmath91 grows like @xmath92 for large @xmath93 , while @xmath94 decays faster than any inverse polynomial in @xmath93 as @xmath95 .",
    "we now look at the simplest case of the general qwei derived above ; the massless case .",
    "we then compare our result for the dirac field with those for the scalar field derived by ford and roman  @xcite and fewster and eveson  @xcite . substituting @xmath96 in the first line of eq .   and performing the integral over @xmath97",
    ", we immediately find that the four - dimensional qwei for massless fields takes the form @xmath98 which is also the @xmath99 limit of eq .   because @xmath100 as @xmath101 .",
    "since the integrand is an even function in @xmath93 , we may extend the range of integration to the whole of @xmath18 to give @xmath102 where we have used parseval s theorem to yield a @xmath103-space version of the quantum inequality in the last line . in passing , we observe that , because @xmath104 is bounded between @xmath105 and @xmath8 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : q3d ] ) , the introduction of a mass only serves to tighten the qwei bound . accordingly , eq",
    ".   also holds for massive dirac fields .",
    "comparison with the quantum inequality for the scalar and electromagnetic fields in minkowski space derived in  @xcite shows that the massless dirac bound is weaker than the corresponding scalar bound by a factor of @xmath106 , and stronger than the electromagnetic bound by a factor of @xmath107 . since none of these bounds are optimal , it is difficult to draw definite conclusions from this beyond the observation that the bounds are of comparable magnitude",
    ".    in particular , for the choice of a lorentzian sampling function peaked at @xmath108 , with characteristic width @xmath109 @xmath110 in which @xmath109 sets the averaging timescale , it is straightforward to calculate @xmath111 ( at least for those states for which the right - hand side is well - defined ) .",
    "this is a slightly stronger result , by a factor of @xmath112 , than the quantum inequality derived by ford and roman  @xcite for the scalar field .",
    "we have therefore explained why the specific classes of states considered in  @xcite satisfy the ford  roman qwei .",
    "we also observe that a traversable wormhole supported by a dirac field would be subject to slightly tighter constraints than those envisaged in  @xcite .",
    "we have derived a new and explicit qwei for the dirac field of mass @xmath0 in four - dimensional minkowski space , by straightforward means .",
    "our argument is related to the general ( but inexplicit ) qwei obtained in  @xcite , in that lemma  1 is at its heart ; one may therefore regard it as an improved and streamlined version of  @xcite ( for the particular case of averaging along an inertial trajectory in minkowski space ) with the added benefit of a closed - form expression for the bound .",
    "although it is at present somewhat formal , we expect that our argument can be made fully rigorous ( by means of microlocal techniques , cf .",
    "@xcite ) and that it can shed further light on the general situation in curved spacetimes , again leading to explicit bounds .",
    "our argument is also related to that developed for the scalar field in  @xcite , and which we briefly summarise in appendix  [ appx : b ] . in each case , an identity for fourier transforms ( the convolution theorem or lemma  1 ) and the ( anti)commutation relations are used to express the averaged energy density as an integral of manifestly positive operators , modulo a @xmath113-number term which eventually provides the lower bound .",
    "extra care is required in the dirac case because the classical energy density is unbounded both from above and below .",
    "finally , in contrast to vollick s two - dimensional bound  @xcite , our qwei is not expected to be the sharpest bound possible .",
    "again , it is hoped to address this issue elsewhere .",
    "in this appendix , we wish to state and prove the following lemma ( originally proved in  @xcite by a slightly different method ) : if @xmath56 for real - valued @xmath62 , then @xmath114 to obtain this result , first notice that the left - hand side is the momentum space integral kernel for the operator @xmath115 where @xmath17 acts by multiplication and @xmath116 .",
    "that is , @xmath117 holds ( at least ) for all smooth , compactly supported @xmath20 . on the other hand , because @xmath56 , we also have @xmath118g+g[g , p ] = 2gpg\\ ] ] because @xmath119=ig'$ ] , another multiplication operator .",
    "written as an integral operator , we therefore have @xmath120 since both   and   hold for all smooth compactly supported @xmath20 , the two integral kernels must also agree , therefore yielding  , using the fact that @xmath121 because @xmath2 is real .",
    "for ease of comparison with our dirac qwei , we briefly summarise the scalar field argument of  @xcite . ( notation differs slightly , and",
    "we have specialised to four - dimensional minkowski space . )",
    "this argument begins by observing that the averaged energy density may be written as a sum of terms of the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the annihilation and creation operators of the scalar field , and @xmath125 is polynomially bounded in @xmath35 . introducing operators @xmath126 a calculation using the commutation relations satisfied by the annihilation and creation operators and the convolution theorem in the form @xmath127 ( and the fact that @xmath128 as @xmath2 is real ) yields the expression @xmath129 since the right - hand side of eq .   is ( formally ) a manifestly positive operator ,",
    "we conclude that the expectation value of @xmath130 in any quantum state @xmath20 must satisfy the following bound : latexmath:[\\[\\langle s^\\pm\\rangle_{\\psi }    \\geqslant - \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi } \\int \\frac{d^{3}{{\\boldsymbol{k}}}}{(2\\pi)^{3 } }"
