    "radio surveys of the sky in the time domain have often been used to identify new astrophysical phenomena .",
    "highly variable radio sources can serve as signposts to compact , high energy objects which are accompanied by high magnetic fields and/or relativistic particle acceleration .",
    "radio variability from quasars and @xmath10-ray bursts ( dent 1965 ; frail et al .",
    "1997 ) was used to infer bulk relativistic motions in these objects ( rees 1967 ; goodman et al .",
    "notable new phenomena identified from radio time - domain surveys include the discovery of the first pulsars ( hewish et al . 1968 ) , the galactic high - energy binary lsi+61@xmath11303 ( gregory and taylor 1978 ) , the anomalous variability of 4c21.53 that lead to the discovery of millisecond pulsars ( backer et al . 1982 ) , and the still - mysterious extreme scattering events ( fiedler et al .",

    "these authors discovered a total of ten transients , eight in the 5-ghz band and two in the 8-ghz band .",
    "eight of these transients were detected in a single epoch .",
    "therefore , their duration is shorter than the time between successive epochs ( one week ) and longer than the exposure time ( 20min ) .",
    "moreover , the majority of these sources do not have any optical counterpart coinciding with their position .",
    "the lack of optical counterparts down to limiting magnitudes of 27.6 in @xmath12-band and 26.5 in @xmath13-band is especially puzzling and significantly limits the classes of objects that can be associated with these events ( ofek et al . 2010 ) .    in a possibly related work , kuniyoshi et al .",

    "( 2010 ) we suggested that the properties of the single epoch `` bower et al . transients '' and the nasu transients are consistent with emerging from a single class of objects , namely isolated old neutron stars ( ns ) .",

    "in this paper we present a new vla survey for radio transients and variables at low galactic latitudes .",
    "our main motivation for this survey was to detect more examples of this new class of short - lived radio transients , with the goal of identifying them in real - time in order to find their counterparts at other wavelengths for further study .",
    "a second , and equally important motivation for this survey was to characterize the transient and variable radio sky with a sensitivity and cadence which had not been carried out previously .",

    "in addition three appendices discussing : flux calibration ; the statistics of max / min of a time series ; and transient areal density calculation in the case of a beam with non - uniform sensitivity are provided .",
    "existing 0.8 - 8ghz surveys have already explored , to some extent , the dynamic radio sky with a wide range of sensitivities , angular resolution and cadences .",
    "however , compared with synoptic surveys at higher frequencies ( infra - red to @xmath10-rays ) the radio sky remains poorly explored . in table",
    "[ tab : previoussurveys ] we summarize past synoptic radio surveys . for each survey",
    "we list also the number of transients , as well as variables which vary by more than 50% .",
    "we note however , that comparison of these numbers is complicated due to several factors . a radio image may be accomplished either through a single pointing , or adding several scans taken at different times .",
    "if the time span , @xmath14 , containing all the observation composing a single `` epoch '' is larger than the transient duration ( or variability time scale ) then the survey sensitivity to transients ( variables ) is degraded .",
    "additionally , the probability of detecting significant variability depends on @xmath14 and the typical time scale between epochs ( @xmath15 ) , through the variability structure function . depending on the statistical method used to define the variability amplitude ,",

    "therefore , the total areal density of their transients is the number of transients divided by the total scanned sky area and divided by 1.61 , which is @xmath67deg@xmath68 .",
    "where the 1.61 factor is due to the fact that their sensitivity is not uniform within the beam and , and is calculated using equation  [ eq : nbuni ] in appendix  [ ap : rate ] . assuming the transients duration is 1day than their rate is @xmath69deg@xmath68yr@xmath70 .",
    "we note that our derived nasu transients rate is roughly consistent with the upper limit on the rate given by kida et al .",
    "therefore , we speculate that there was a confusion between areal density and transient rate in the matsumura et al .",

    "two surveys at 5ghz have specifically targeted the galactic plane .",
    "taylor and gregory ( 1983 ) and gregory and taylor ( 1986 ) used the nrao 91-m telescope to image an approximately 500deg@xmath74 region from galactic longitude @xmath75deg to @xmath76deg with galactic latitude @xmath77deg in 16 epochs over a 5-year period .",
    "they identified one transient candidate which underwent a 1jy flare but for which follow - up vla observations showed no quiescent radio counterpart ( tsutsumi et al .",
    "they also claimed tentative evidence for a separate galactic population of strong variables comprising 2% of their sources .",
    "support for this comes from galactic survey of becker et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who find about one half of their variable source sample ( 17/39 ) , or 3% of all radio sources in the galactic plane , undergo strong variability on 1-year and 15-year baselines .",
    "we note that the surface density of radio sources in the galactic plane is only slightly higher ( @xmath78% ) than at high galactic latitudes ( helfand et al .",
    "2006 ; murphy et al . 2007 ) .",
    "one of the largest variability survey of its kind was carried out using the 7-beam receiver on the nrao 91-m telescope ( scott 1996 ; gregory et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the sky from 0@xmath79 was surveyed over two 1-month periods in 1986 november and 1987 october ( condon , broderick & seielstad 1989 ; becker et al .",
    "1991 ; condon et al . 1994 ; gregory et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the final catalog , made by combining both the 1996 and 1997 epochs , contained 75,162 discrete sources with flux densities @xmath80 mjy . long term variability information was available for the majority of the sources by comparing the mean flux densities between the 1986 and 1987 epochs .",
    "scott ( 1996 ) carried out a preliminary analysis of the long - term measurements and identified 146 highly variable sources , or @xmath811% of the cataloged radio sources .",
    "eight possible transients in the scott ( 1996 ; table 5.1 ) list appear in either 1986 or 1987 but are undetected in the other epoch ( @xmath82@xmath6 ) .",
    "two sources are previously identified variables from the gregory and taylor ( 1986 ) survey , while six are flagged as possible false positives due to confusion by nearby bright sources .",
    "one source ( b150958.3@xmath83103541 ) was @xmath84mjy in 1986 and @xmath85mjy in 1987 but it is in both the first and nvss source catalogs .",
    "there are therefore no long - term transients identified in the scott ( 1996 ) survey .    in order to estimate the flux limit above which the scott ( 1996 ) comparison between the 1986 and 1987 surveys is complete , we compared the source numbers near the celestial equator , as a function of flux in the two publicly available catalogs from 1987 and the combined 1986/1987 catalog .",
    "we found that at flux densities below about 40mjy the number of sources , as a function of flux , in the 1987 catalog is rising slower than that for the one of the deeper combined catalog .",
    "therefore , we estimate that near the terrestrial equator , the 1987 catalog is complete above a flux density of about 40mjy . however , these catalogs were made from observations in which each point on the sky was observed @xmath86 times taken within a few days .",
    "this degrades the sensitivity of the comparison carried out by scott ( 1996 ) , for @xmath87day transients , by about @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the scott ( 1996 ) survey is sensitive to short term ( @xmath87day ) transients brighter than about 80mjy ( @xmath89 ) . finally , assuming scott ( 1996 ) did  not find any transients in two epochs , we put a @xmath90-@xmath6 upper limit on the areal density of @xmath87day transients brighter than 80mjy , of @xmath91deg@xmath68 .    in summary , despite the heterogeneous nature of these ghz surveys , it is clear that the radio sky is relatively quiet compared with the @xmath10-rays sky .",
    "the fraction of strong variables among the persistent radio source population is @xmath92@xmath93% from flux densities of 0.1mjy to 1jy . however , the exact percentage of strong variables is still uncertain because of the different criteria used by various surveys .",
    "we note that within this flux density range , radio source populations are dominated by agn roughly above 1mjy and star forming galaxies dominates the source counts below 1mjy ( condon 1984 ; windhorst 1985 ) .",

    "our findings suggest that short time scale variability among 5ghz point sources is common .",
    "in fact above 1.5mjy at least 30% of the point sources are variable with variability exceeding our 4-@xmath6 detection level .",

    "in order to construct the best light curves of the sources we need to remove any systematic factors influencing the measurements . a way to do this is to use the fact that the actual light curves of many sources are not correlated .",
    "therefore , in the absence of systematic factors affecting the measurements , the scatter in the average light curve should be minimized . in order to minimize the scatter in the average light curve of our sources we multiplied the fluxes at each epoch of observation ( taken during @xmath299  hours ) by a `` gain '' correction factor , such that the residuals in all light curves , compared with a constant light curves , will be minimized .",
    "this problem , is similar to producing relative photometry light curves in optical astronomy .",
    "we used a linear least square minimization technique . using this method we are solving for the best zero point normalization ( per epoch ) , and the best `` mean '' flux of each source , that minimize the global scatter in all the light curves .",
    "this technique was already introduced by honeycutt ( 1992 ) , but here we write it in a more easy to use form and we also add linear set of constraints for simultaneous absolute calibration .",
    "we work in a `` magnitude '' system ( i.e. , @xmath300 ) .",
    "the advantage of the magnitude system is that the logarithm of a quantity has the property of making error distribution more symmetrical , and this may be somewhat important for faint sources .",
    "the basic idea of this technique is to simultaneously solve the following set of equations in the least square sense : @xmath301 where @xmath138 is a @xmath302 matrix that contains all the measured ( `` instrumental '' ) magnitudes , @xmath142 is the epoch index ( @xmath303 epochs ) , and @xmath141 is the source index ( @xmath304 sources ) . here , @xmath144 is the mean magnitude of the @xmath141-th source and @xmath143 is the zero point of the @xmath142-th epoch .",
    "we note that @xmath144 and @xmath143 are free parameters . in case we have error measurements ,",
    "let @xmath305 be the respective errors in the instrumental magnitudes . in some cases , we may have additional constraints like the calibrated magnitudes , @xmath306 , ( and respective errors , @xmath307 ) of some or all the sources .",

    "our output magnitudes will be calibrated in respect to a set of reference sources .    given @xmath138 and @xmath305 , and the optional @xmath306 and @xmath307 we would like to find the properly weighted best fit free parameters @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "let @xmath308 be a vector of the observable quantities ( reorganization of @xmath138 ) , and @xmath309 the respective vector of errors in these quantities obtained by re - arranging the matrices of instrumental and calibrated magnitudes ( i.e. , @xmath138 and @xmath305 ) : @xmath310 ,   &     \\vec{\\sigma } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }           \\sigma^{m}_{11 } \\\\",

    "note that ( again ) the lower block of the matrix @xmath313 , separated by two horizontal lines , is an optional section that is used for the magnitude zero - point calibration .",
    "this additional section acts like constraints on the system of linear equations .",
    "the rank of the matrix @xmath313 without the lower block is @xmath323 .",

    "the design matrix , @xmath313 , even without the magnitude calibration part , is an @xmath329 matrix . for many problems , the matrix @xmath313 ,",
    "may be huge and requires a lot of computer memory .",
    "however , @xmath313 is highly sparse , and therefore sparse matrix utilities can be used if needed .",
    "alternatively , this can be solved using the conjugate gradient methodquake - papers / painless - conjugate - gradient.pdf ] .",
    "we note that in practice this method may be applied iteratively .",
    "after the first iteration , we can check the @xmath330 for each source and the @xmath331 for each epoch .",
    "then , we can remove sources with large value of @xmath330 , and/or we can add a `` cosmic '' errors to all the measurements in an epoch with large @xmath331 . after we construct the new @xmath313 and @xmath332 we may apply the inversion again .",
    "we note that typically , in addition to @xmath333 ( the errors associated with the individual sources ) there are additional errors ( e.g. , calibration errors in radio astronomy and flat fielding errors in optical astronomy ) .",
    "ignoring these errors is not recommended since it will give over weight to sources with small errors .",
    "a solution to this problem is , again , to apply this method in iterations .",
    "after the first iteration it is possible to estimate the cosmic error term ( based on the residuals from the best fit ) , and to add these cosmic errors to the instrumental errors in the second iteration .",
    "finally , using this method additional de - trending is possible .",
    "for example , one can add additional columns to the design matrix ( and corresponding additional terms to the vector of free parameters ) that represent changes in the zero point as a function of additional parameters .",
    "for example , in radio astronomy , this may be a variation in the zero point as a function of the distance from the beam center , and in optical astronomy this may be an airmass - color term , positional terms , color terms affecting different instruments and more .",
    "the @xmath334 and @xmath335 defined in equations  [ vr][vf ] are sensitive to the number of measurements .",
