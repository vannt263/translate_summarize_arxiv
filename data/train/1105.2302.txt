    "three well - known components of the diffuse microwave galactic foreground consist of synchrotron emission , free - free emission from plasma ( thermal bremsstrahlung ) and thermal emission from dust . however , in the microwave range of frequency from @xmath10@xmath11 ghz , anomalous emission which was difficult to reconcile with the components above was reported ( kogut et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ) .",
    "an explanation for the anomalous emission was proposed by draine & lazarian ( 1998ab , hereafter dl98 model ) , where it was identified as electric dipole emission from rapidly spinning dust grains ( hereafter spinning dust emission ) .",
    "although spinning dust emission had been discussed previously ( see erickson 1957 ; ferrara & dettmar 1994 ) , draine & lazarian were the first to include the variety of excitation and damping processes that are relevant for very small grains .    while the dl98 model appears to be in general agreement with observations ( see lazarian & finkbeiner 2003 ; finkbeiner 2004 ) , it did not account for a number of physical effects , namely , the non - sphericity of grain shapes , internal relaxation , and transient spin - up due to ion collisions .",
    "the planck collaboration 2011b has reported new observations of spinning dust emission in new environments . spinning dust",
    "now provides a potential diagnostic tool for interstellar dust properties ( shape , size distribution , dipole moment ) . a comprehensive model of spinning dust for different grain shapes",
    "is required .",
    "recent studies showed that the correspondence of the dl98 model to observations can be improved by adjusting the parameters of the model .",
    "for instance , the five - year ( _ wmap _ ) data showed a broad bump at @xmath12 ghz in the h@xmath8-correlated emission ( dobler & finkbeiner 2008 ; dobler , draine & finkbeiner 2009 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 ghz frequency of the peak is higher than the value predicted ( @xmath14 ghz ) by the dl98 model for standard parameters of the warm ionized medium ( wim ) .",
    "dobler et al . (",
    "2009 ) showed that the bump is consistent with the dl98 model modified so that the characteristic dipole moment of grains is decreased and gas density of the wim is increased , relative to the typical spinning dust parameters in draine & lazarian ( 1998b , hereafter dl98b ) .",
    "ali - hamoud , hirata & dickinson ( 2009 ) revisited the spinning dust model and presented an analytic solution to the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation that describes the rotational excitation of a spherical grain if the discrete nature of the impulses can be neglected .",
    "hoang , draine & lazarian ( 2010 , hereafter hdl10 ) improved the dl98 model by accounting for a number of physical effects .",
    "the main modifications in their improved model of spinning dust emission are as follows .",
    "\\(i ) disk - like grains rotate with the grain symmetry axis @xmath15 not perfectly aligned with the angular momentum @xmath16 . the disaligned rotation of @xmath17 with @xmath15 causes wobbling of the grain principal axes with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath16 due to internal thermal fluctuations .",
    "\\(ii ) distribution functions for grain angular momentum and velocity are obtained exactly using the langevin equation ( le ) for the evolution of grain angular momentum in an inertial coordinate system .",
    "\\(iii ) the limiting cases of fast internal relaxation and no internal relaxation are both considered for calculation of the angular momentum distributions and emissivity of spinning dust .",
    "\\(iv ) infrequent collisions of single ions which deposit an angular momentum larger than the grain angular momentum prior to collision are treated as poisson - distributed events .",
    "the wobbling disk - like grain has anisotropic rotational damping and excitation .",
    "such an anisotropy can increase the peak emissivity by a factor @xmath18 , and increases the peak frequency by a factor @xmath19 , compared to the results from the dl98 model .",
    "the effect of the grain wobbling on electric dipole emission was independently studied in silsbee et al .",
    "( 2011 ) using a fokker - planck ( fp ) equation approach , but they disregarded the effect of internal relaxation and transient spin - up by infrequent ion collisions .",
    "earlier models of spinning dust emission dealt with axisymmetric grains having moments of inertia @xmath20 ( see hdl10 ; silsbee et al .",
    "an axisymmetric grain of an angular momentum @xmath16 radiates in general at four frequency modes @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the angular frequency of precession of the grain symmetry axis @xmath15 about @xmath16 , and @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the angle between @xmath16 and @xmath15 is the angular frequency of the grain rotation about its symmetry axis @xmath15 . for an `` irregular '' ( i.e. triaxial body )",

    "this wobbling , that is different from the wobbling due to the internal thermal fluctuations studied in hdl10 for the disk - like grain , can result in a more complex electric dipole emission spectrum , so that it modifies the spinning dust emission .",
    "we will quantify this effect in  3 .",
    "very small grains ( smaller than @xmath28 ) are important for spinning dust emission .",
    "but also within this range of grain size , the grain dust temperature has strong fluctuations due to absorption of uv photons ( greenberg 1968 ; draine & anderson 1985 ) . as a result , they can not be characterized by a single equilibrium temperature , and are described by a temperature distribution function ( draine & li 2001 ) .",
    "the temperature fluctuations induce wobbling of the grain axes with respect to the angular momentum and modify the spinning dust spectrum .",
    "this issue is addressed in  5.1 .",
    "we investigate also spinning dust emission in the presence of compressible turbulence .",
    "an increase of the spinning dust emission arises as a result of the non - linear dependence of emissivity on gas density .    the seven - year _ wmap _ data ( gold et al .",

    ", this process tends to result in nearly perfect alignment of the grain axis of major inertia with the angular momentum . naturally ,",
    "if the grain has nonzero vibrational energy , energy can also be transferred from the vibrational modes into grain rotational energy ( jones & spitzer 1969 ) .",
    "for an isolated grain , a small amount of energy gained from the vibrational modes results in fluctuations of the rotational energy @xmath116 when the grain angular momentum is conserved .",

    "so , when the vibrational energy decreases due to ir emission , as long as the vibrational - rotational ( v - r ) energy exchange exists , interactions between vibrational and rotational systems maintain a thermal equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath120 . as a result ,",
    "the lte distribution function of rotational energy reads ( hereafter vre regime ; see lazarian & roberge 1997 ) : f_(s , j)(- ) ( -).[eq : fs ]    the existence of v - r energy exchange depends on the rotational modes . in principle , the rotational energy can change in increments of @xmath121 , with @xmath122 being the angular frequency of rotational modes . however , at low vibrational energy @xmath123 , the vibrational mode spectrum is sparse , and there may not be available transitions with @xmath124 . for the case",
    "@xmath15 parallel to @xmath16 , the v - r energy exchange occurs only when the grain is hot just after absorption of a uv photon , because the grain rotating with @xmath125 has only one rotational mode @xmath126 . as the grain cools down further , there is no available vibrational transition corresponding to an energy change @xmath127 , and the v - r coupling ceases .    for disk - like or irregular grain , multiple rotational frequency modes are observed , and some modes correspond to energy @xmath128 ( see eq .",

    "this may allow v - r energy exchange even when the vibrational energy is relatively low .",
    "nevertheless , the energy separation between the vibrational ground state and the first vibrationally - excited state is large enough that v - r energy exchange is unlikely to take place after the pah cools to the vibrational ground sate .",

    "if @xmath61 crosses the separatrix state @xmath142 , the new flip state is effectively chosen randomly .",
    "changes in @xmath61 can also result from external forcing ( e.g. , collisions with gas atoms or absorption / emission of radiation ) , that may change both @xmath134 and @xmath116 .",
    "if the external torques are not `` chiral '' , then the changes in @xmath61 over time will result in equal probabilities of the two flip states .",

    "the underlying reason is that the deformation of the grain from the disk - like shape allows the grain to rotate along the axis of minimum moment of inertia @xmath27 , in addition to rotation about @xmath15 and @xmath282 axes . for a given angular momentum ,",
    "the angular velocity along @xmath27 is largest , so that the emission frequency of the irregular grain is in general higher than that of the disk - like grain with the same mass .",

    "but for case 2 , @xmath304 decreases with @xmath286 for @xmath308 , and starts to increase with @xmath286 as @xmath141 increases .    when the internal thermal fluctuations are rather weak ( @xmath481 ) so that the grain tends to rotate with the minimum rotational energy , @xmath25 and @xmath61 deviate slightly from @xmath482 and @xmath483 , and the rotational emission spectrum of irregular grains differs only slightly from that of disk - like grains .",
    "in contrast , for strong thermal fluctuations ( @xmath484 ) , the thermal fluctuations enable grains to spend an important fraction of time rotating with large @xmath61 . because the total power emission increases with @xmath61 , the higher probability of rotating with larger @xmath61 results in larger emissivity and peak frequency than disk - like grains .",
    "we investigated the effects of changing the orientation of the electric dipole moment @xmath2 .",
    "we found ( see fig .",
    "9 ) that as the orientation is varied from having a component parallel to @xmath15 ( case 1 , @xmath151 ) to being entirely perpendicular to @xmath15 ( case 2 , @xmath306 ) , the peak frequency @xmath303 and the peak emissivity both decrease by @xmath330 . given the sensitivity of the spectrum to other variables ( mass distribution , @xmath485 , grain shape , gas density , gas temperature ) , it does not seem possible to infer the orientation of @xmath2 from observations of the spectrum .",
