    "density functional theory ( dft ) is considered one of the best and most reliable condensed - matter tools for non - empirical studies of molecular , surface , bulk and compound properties.@xcite standard implementations , using the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation energy , provide an accurate description of the binding in regions characterized by high electron density .",
    "an even more widespread dft usage will follow from an ability to address soft- and sparse - matter systems , structures that have internal voids or low - electron - density regions dominated by the van der waals ( vdw ) forces , also called the london dispersion forces.@xcite while neither lda nor gga capture the truly nonlocal correlation effects that underpin those forces,@xcite the last decade has seen development of both vdw - extended dft@xcite and of regular nonlocal exchange - correlation functionals.@xcite the first class of methods are often atom centered and require use of a damping function or equivalent , while the second class of methods fits inside the regular dft framework",
    ". both types of sparse - matter dft can describe , for example , vdw forces between molecules .",

    "the method employs the coulomb gauge ( with green function @xmath1 ) and a scalar dielectric function @xmath2 . in its most general form,@xcite",
    "the vdw - df method is a reformulation of the adiabatic connection formula@xcite ( acf ) and assumes that a plasmon - pole approximation@xcite for @xmath2 can satisfy @xmath3 + e_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize self } } } , \\label{eq : acfepsilondefine}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes the complex frequency and where @xmath5 is the internal coulomb self - energy of each electron .",
    "this equation summarizes an , in principle , exact description of the ( longitudinal ) electrodynamics in the inhomogeneous electron gas and reflects the use of a dyson equation for handling screening . like the ggas",
    ", the vdw - df method further uses physics - based constraints@xcite to approximate the plasmon - pole response and thus defines the functional form of a nonlocal correlation term , @xmath6 . in the recent explicit functional versions , called vdw - df1@xcite and vdw - df2,@xcite the nonlocal energy @xmath7 $ ]",

    "the vdw - df method has been and is being tested for many systems .",
    "it delivers a parameter - free atomic - scale characterization of the binding in complex sparse - matter systems .",
    "selfconsistent ( sc ) vdw - df calculations can be used to calculate stress within periodic unit cells@xcite and guide atomic optimization ( relaxation ) .",

    "the problem is confounded by the fact that ( especially in biochemically relevant problems ) we are often forced to address nonperiodic systems where size - convergence of the model unit - cell size becomes important.@xcite molecular transport studies,@xcite and many molecular - crystal problems,@xcite further exemplify the general need to address vdw binding in big systems .",
    "the challenge for typical sparse - matter dft is increasingly becoming that of computing the steric hindrance effects that are described by the dft kinetic - energy repulsion .",
    "when we reach thousands of atoms , all first - principle and vdw - extended dft calculations are simply limited by memory requirements and computational costs of the wavefunction evaluation .",
    "in this paper we propose and test an adaption of the harris scheme@xcite to perform non - selfconsistent ( nsc ) vdw - df calculations for sparse matter .",
    "the aim is to explore possibilities for reducing the computational cost of the wavefunction - evaluation bottleneck that could be impeding an even broader vdw - df usage in , for example , biochemistry.@xcite the approach consists of using a superposition of the fragment ( electron ) densities , and is here termed sfd - vdw - df .",
    "it can be seen as an alternative to the more costly nsc - vdw - df or even sc - vdw - df evaluations.@xcite it is just the regular vdw - df harris scheme if the fragment densities are based on vdw - df calculations .",
    "however , the sfd framework also works without a vdw - df implementation of the underlying dft code , and we reserve the term sfd - vdw - df to cases where the fragment densities are obtained from gga calculations .",
    "the method uses our code for real - space vdw - df evaluation based on the charge densities from the underlying dft code.@xcite    we present formal analysis and a testing of the sfd - vdw - df computational scheme for molecular systems . as an interesting aside",
    ", the analysis also identifies conditions for expecting significant vdw - induced changes in the bandstructure or electron dynamics for a given binding morphology .",
    "we separately test how well the sfd framework faithfully reproduces interaction effects that arise from the semi - local part of the vdw - df functional .",
    "we test the performance of the sfd - vdw - df scheme across the s22 benchmark set@xcite and for systems with a varying degree of static polarizations .",
    "we observe that while a vdw - df harris scheme ( evaluated with vdw - df fragment densities ) is correct to second order in binding - induced density changes , @xmath9 , the proposed scheme is formally only correct to linear order in these density changes .",
    "however , we also find that the linear term @xmath10 is weighted by the changes in the effective kohn - sham ( ks ) potential that result from the shift from the gga to the vdw - df functional .",
    "the sfd - vdw - df scheme may thus be broadly applicable in the absence of large static dipoles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we summarize the case for developing an accelerated ( but approximate ) vdw - df description of biomolecular interaction . in section",
    "iii we present some details of the lda , gga , and vdw - df family of constraint - based density functionals to facilitate a formal analysis and our proposal for the sfd - vdw - df scheme in section iv .",
    "section v provides a brief summary of computational ( and implementation ) details .",
    "section vi presents the results of the performance testing that we have carried out for the proposed sfd - vdw - df scheme , while sec .",
    "vii contains a discussion .",
    "finally , section viii contains summary and outlook .",
    "in a related work@xcite we report a vdw - df mapping of the vdw attraction in a dna dimer ( two periodic double - helix strands ) .",
    "that pilot study illustrates that general conclusions can be made for the important biomolecular - interaction problem from computing merely how @xmath6 depends on the interaction geometry .",
    "the nonempirical nature and the regular - density - functional basis ( no external parameters ) makes vdw - df well suited to pursue investigations of biomolecular interactions .",
    "the full dna interaction problem touches on two general challenges for refining a computational description of life processes .",
    "first , it illustrates the workings of molecular recognition ( the matching by weak forces of the genes or just the packing of our genome in its environment ) .",
    "second , it reminds us of the challenge of characterizing these effects in a solution that contains counter ions .",
    "since the counter ions , per se , can be expected to play a smaller role in the overall interfragment vdw attraction , it is natural to focus a sparse - matter dft study on the charged biomolecular structures themselves .",
    "however , for this approach to become meaningful , we must be able to also characterize the vdw bonding at various charging states .",
    "being a regular ( parameter free ) nonlocal density functional , vdw - df has an inherent advantage for computational studies of biomolecular interactions .",
    "the prospect of vdw - df studies of biomolecular systems is as promising in terms of computational cost ( and , currently , as restrained ) as it is for other sparse - matter dft approaches .",
    "the evaluation of the nonlocal correlation , @xmath11 , causes no relevant slow down or bottlenecks thanks to the order-@xmath8 scaling in the real - space evaluation approach for large systems.@xcite in fact , our mapping of dna attraction@xcite demonstrates that vdw - df has , in practice , an efficiency similar to that of dft - d for large biomolecular problems .",
    "there are for the dna - dimer attraction problem@xcite no memory bottlenecks and essentially a linear scaling at least up to 1000 + cores for the @xmath11 evaluation .",
    "it is already today possible to bring that functional evaluation to about ten minutes wall time . while this evaluation of @xmath11 does cost more than adding the dispersion term in dft - d,@xcite neither of these descriptions of the vdw attraction cause limitations : the computing expense is irrelevant when compared to the cost of converging the density in even one dna ( one periodically repeated coil of a dna double helix ) in dft .",
    "with such a promise , it is frustrating that a full dft study of the dna dimer is today impossible without an allocation at a petaflop facility .",
    "there is a need to accelerate the dft determination of large - system wavefunctions and for sparse matter investigations in general . here",
    "we explore an approach that focuses on accelerating the evaluation of the kinetic - energy repulsion , and which can , in principle , reduce the wavefunction - solution stage to just a single electronic iteration , as is possible with the regular harris scheme.@xcite         +     figure [ fig : s22_dimer ] illustrates the feasibility of using the sfd - vdw - df for accelerated vdw - df studies of biomolecular interactions .",
    "it reports a comparison of binding in an ammonia dimer and shows that the sfd - vdw - df2 description is in excellent agreement with the binding predicted by sc - vdw - df2 ( indicated by a cross ) .",
    "figure [ fig : milky ] summarizes our overall assessment , further detailed in sec .",
    "it testifies to a high degree of robustness across the s22 benchmark set@xcite and for other molecular - interaction problems .",
    "the important observation for developing a biomolecular computational strategy in dft is that the sfd - vdw - df scheme can be as reliable as the often - used nsc - vdw - df evaluation@xcite even if it bypasses the need for a sc determination of the wavefunctions .",
    "the sfd framework could thus be one approach to speed up vdw - df studies of large biomolecular interaction problems at a limited cost in accuracy .",
    "the ( regular ) harris scheme works within a fixed functional choice and takes the following steps : first , self - consistent calculations of the densities @xmath12 for each individual building block ` @xmath13 ' ; second , construction of a density @xmath14 as a superposition of the building blocks , and of the effective single - particle potential @xmath15(\\mathbf{r})$ ] that corresponds to @xmath16 ; and third a nsc , that is , no - density update , calculation of the eigenvalues corresponding to the potential @xmath17 .",
    "these eigenvalues help provide an estimate of the kinetic energy term in the harris scheme.@xcite the harris scheme is traditionally pursued in a lda or gga framework starting , e.g. , from sc gga input densities .",
    "it is today often used when pursuing bandstructure calculations in dft ( and therefore provides very accurate wavefunctions for a given @xmath17 ) .",
    "however , it is also possible to use it for its original purpose , namely for providing efficient but approximate dft studies of interactions .    pursuing a regular vdw - df harris scheme represents one alternative for accelerating vdw - df studies .",
    "we point out that the original study by harris@xcite ( working with lda ) shows that the scheme works reasonably well also for describing the formation of covalent bonds between atoms in some molecules",
    ". it should be even better suited to describe the weaker vdw bonding .",
    "the overall criteria for the applicability of a harris - type scheme is that the fully sc density solution @xmath18 should not differ significantly from the input superposition density @xmath16 .",
    "it can work also when we consider systems , like biomolecules in solution , where the charging from the surrounding counter ions must be considered when providing the input densities ( and hence @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "a vdw - df harris scheme can be expected to work well for a study of supramolecular systems as long as the _ binding - induced _",
    "charge relocations remain small .",
    "a regular harris vdw - df scheme is , however , not the focus here .",
    "this is because we do not yet have the ability to both perform vdw - df calculations and allow an externally - defined superposition of input density in the same code .",
    "we have chosen to build on the dacapo@xcite code ( for input densities and for the nsc kinetic - energy evaluation@xcite ) and on the vdw - df postprocessing@xcite that we have previously used extensively for vdw - df studies .",
    "a benefit of introducing sfd - vdw - df as a supplement to a regular vdw - df harris scheme is that we thus provide a computational framework that can take input densities from an arbitrary code ( through an adaption of any of the real - space strategies for evaluation vdw - df@xcite ) .",
    "we begin with a description of differences between the regular form of the nonlocal functional vdw - df and the traditional local ( lda ) and semilocal ( gga ) dft descriptions .",
    "this facilitates our subsequent discussion of the approximation that can allow an accelerated evaluation in ( nsc ) vdw - df studies .",
    "both gga and vdw - df are refinements of the earlier approach lda that describes the universal exchange correlation functional @xmath19 & = & e_x^{{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize lda}}}}[n]+ e_c ^{{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize lda}}}}[n ] \\\\    e^{{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize lda}}}}_{x , c}[n ] & = & \\int { \\rm d}^3\\mathbf{r}\\ n(\\mathbf{r } )       \\varepsilon_{x , c}^{{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize lda}}}}(n(\\mathbf{r}))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of exchange and correlation energy densities @xmath20 that are just functions of the local density @xmath21",

    "the set of constraint - based ggas is among the most successful@xcite and these extend the plasmon picture of the lda via a wavevector analysis,@xcite while also emphasizing conservation of the exchange - correlation hole .",
    "the development led to robust and very versatile gga forms like the pbe.@xcite in the constraint - based ggas , the form of the exchange energy density @xmath29 is given by an enhancement factor @xmath30 that has been chosen to satisfy a number of scaling laws , formal constraints and guidelines.@xcite formal analysis also guides the choice of the gradient - corrected correlation energy density @xmath31 .",
    "it is important to note that the richer variation that ( [ eq : ggaform ] ) supports is thus tempered by adherence to fundamental physics criteria and that the identification and use of these criteria has helped propel the gga ( and dft ) to a tremendous success.@xcite    the broad class of materials and systems that are characterized by sparseness does , however , require further refinements beyond gga .",
    "for example , organics , biomatter , and supramolecular systems are sparse in the sense that they have internal electron voids or other regions with a low electron distribution . here the binding and function are dominated by the vdw forces that reflect an electrodynamic coupling and act across internal voids .",

    "we will therefore make this assessment in the next subsection .",
    "the benzene dimer is a typical organic system bound by vdw forces .",
    "since this system is weakly bonded , we can expect charge transfer to be small and thus the vdw - df harris scheme , and more generally the sfd framework , to be well suited to describe the system .",

    "this switching of order is related to the fact that vdw - df2 in general has a less repulsive exchange account  @xcite and a less attractive non - local correlation account.@xcite since the smaller size of this system decreases the magnitude of the non - local correlation , it shifts the balance between the repulsive and attractive terms .",
    "the difference between the sfd and nsc vdw - df calculations increases to as much as 30% for vdw - df2 , compared to 17% for the sfd and sc pbe calculations .",

    "our results indicate that the increased inaccuracy of the sfd scheme for polar systems arises primarily from short - ranged effects .",
    "thus , the inaccuracy may be reduced by starting from densities generated with revpbe exchange for sfd - vdw - df1 and in the same vein pw86r for sfd - vdw - df2 .",

    "meanwhile , there now exists a significant experience with using vdw - df for sparse matter systems and the calculations have shown that there is , _ in practice _",
    ", often only limited differences in nsc - vdw - df and sc - vdw - df calculations.@xcite it follows that one must , in general , expect that direct bandstructure effects typically are small .",
    "the speed up gained when using the sfd calculations with dacapo are substantial yet somewhat modest .",
    "computational costs are reduced by 40% and 55% for the benzene and c60 dimer respectively , when using standard cutoffs with a minimal number of bands . considering that this software usually requires about 20 electronic iterations to converge at these system sizes ( but more for large systems ) ,",
    "this gain is less than one might anticipate.@xcite    however , we should consider that standard software like dacapo ( that we here use ) has been subjected to intense efforts to optimize its ability to simultaneously solve the problem of charge relaxation and determination of the ks eigenvalues .",
    "what formally constitutes harris calculations in that code are today primarily used to obtain accurate values for the ks eigenvalues.@xcite we do not desire such enhanced accuracy for an actual sfd - vdw - df study .",
    "the fact that the here - proposed sfd - vdw - df is still faster than nsc - vdw - df ( sec .",
    "vi ) is therefore promising .",
    "furthermore , since the performance , documented here , is excellent for many molecular systems , there is room for more compromise on accuracy .",
    "we believe that the present results motivate the approach to be further evaluated in forthcoming studies.@xcite      we are ultimately interested in vdw - df computational studies for large - scale interaction problems where there are relevant speed ups to be gained by _ not _ seeking the fully sc density ( as described either in a full gga or in a full vdw - df study ) .",
    "the acceleration must come from minimizing the cost of dft calculations of the steric - hindrance or kinetic - energy repulsion effects ( as this is the large - system bottleneck ) .",
    "we note that a parallel study , ref .  , pursues a closely related computational strategy and _ begins _ a first - principle dft mapping of the morphology variation on the vdw attraction in a dna dimer by first focusing on an efficient evaluation of @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "the dna dimer system is there taken as an example of a typical large - scale biomolecular interaction problem .    the vdw - df exploration that is proposed in ref .",
    "bypasses the need for performing the expensive computations of the kinetic - energy repulsion term ( which , in any case , is not relevant outside the binding regime that extends to a nearest - atoms separation of about 4.0  , ref .  ) .",
    "the first - principle vdw - df survey of dna attraction thus achieves a dramatic speed up but can still ( for relevant large - molecular system interaction geometries ) be supplemented by adding the other components of the harris - type sfd - vdw - df scheme ( [ htypevdwdfdefined ] ) .",
    "to accelerate large - scale vdw - df characterization of biomolecular systems it seems useful to adapt the ideas of the harris scheme@xcite as is indicated and explored here . a harris - type approximation which works reasonably well for describing the kinetic - energy effects of forming covalent bonds of atoms in some molecules",
    "should have a good chance of describing the simpler kinetic - energy repulsion ( steric hindrance ) of molecules in supramolecular systems .    here , we have put this expectation to the test .",
    "our results indicate that this scheme is promising for describing supramolecular systems bonded primarily by vdw forces .",
    "however , if one or more fragments are highly polar , this comes at the cost of accuracy .",
    "the pair of papers suggest a possible computational strategy for the study of binding in large supramolecular systems .",
    "the suggestion is to _ begin _ the structure and interaction - morphology search by essentially cost - free evaluations of the @xmath6 variation . that @xmath6 step is available simply from relatively cheap calculations of fragment electron densities .",
    "one can in turn search for relevant binding motifs , given the linking to the here - proposed and tested sfd - vdw - df scheme .",
    "this strategy eventually leads to a complete vdw - df estimate of the variation in total interaction energy .",
    "the strategy exists as an alternative to implementing a real - space vdw - df version in a code that realizes genuine order-@xmath8 scaling for large systems .",
    "having established the promise of the sfd scheme for systems bound by vdw forces , the next step would be to investigate if the scheme can be further accelerated , in particular for large supramolecular systems .",
    "to this end , implementations for a full sfd - vdw - df scheme for other dft codes ( beyond dacapo ) are being tested .",
