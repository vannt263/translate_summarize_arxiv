    "it has been highlighted that these changes are strongly dependent on the austenite - martensite ( a - m ) interface energy which in the end controls the material s applicability for sensors and damping elements in structures  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the role of the interface energy in the transformation kinetics and consequently in the material behavior has drawn an increasing interest in condensed matter physics @xcite . in the past ,",

    ", the phase interface energy can easily be taken into consideration .",
    "the interface energy contains chemical and mechanical contributions , where the latter are due to elastic energy stored in the vicinity of the interface between the austenitic and martensitic phases @xcite .",
    "so the interface energy considered here does not present a microscopical ( local ) quantity , but should be considered at a mesoscopic scale as an integral measure of the potential interface between austenite and martensite phase .",
    "this interpretation implies higher values of the interface energy than is usually used in micromechanical models .",

    "this narrowing of the transformation zone implies an increased phase stability .",

    ", we remark that the deformation wave speed @xmath82 ( in a one - dimensional case only longitudinal waves are present ) is inversely proportional to the square root of the product of the density and the compliance @xmath83 where @xmath84 . for shape memory alloys the density is almost independent from the phase , whereas the compliance increases significantly within the transformation region as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . for a given temperature",
    "the peak compliance increases with increasing interface energy .",
    "thus , a shock wave , which is capable of initiating a stress - induced transformation , slows down within the transformation zone .",
    "the higher the interface energy , the more pronounced is this deceleration process .",
    "a further important factor for damping properties is the hysteretic behavior of the material , therefore it is the future step in our study to introduce a physically meaningful hysteresis mechanism .",

    "using one - dimensional monte - carlo lattice simulations based on a statistical micromechanical model , we demonstrated for different external stresses a smooth increase in the martensite phase fraction with decreasing temperature .",
    "the width of the martensite transformation is shown to depend on the austenite - martensite interface energy : the higher this energy , the sharper the transformation .",
    "note that to demonstrate better this trend and to partly compensate the one - dimensionality of our system , we deliberately exaggerated the interface energy . by analyzing the transformation in stress - temperature space ,",
    "we show the influence of the interface energy on the effective compliance of the material subjected to a martensitic transformation . in agreement with",
    "the stress - temperature curve generally observed experimentally for the onset of the martensite transformation  @xcite , we obtain an almost linear relation between stress and temperature for the parity curve ( inset in fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "our results suggest a possible direction in the improvement of shape - memory alloys aimed at increasing the interface energy between the martensite and the austenite phases .",
    "use of materials with a sharper martensite transformation ( owing to a high interface energy ) will result in more sensitive and energy - efficient smart systems : switches , actuators , etc .    for an investigation of the entire properties and quantitative comparisons with experiments it is inevitable to simulate at least a two - dimensional lattice system including multiple martensitic variants and internal stresses .",
    "interface energies between martensitic variants [ as in  @xcite ] and the choice of the variant under complex external loads and temperatures are also under consideration .",
    "although it is easy to extend the monte - carlo simulations for an arbitrary dimension of the lattice , the incorporation of internal stresses in the formulation is not trivial and the work in this direction is in progress .",
    "moreover , we are working on a thermodynamically coherent introducing of the latent heat and the internal friction @xcite in the system in order to reproduce a transformation hysteresis .",
