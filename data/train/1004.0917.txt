    "the four - dimensionality of the spacetime is one of the biggest problems in theoretical physics .",
    "one of the possible ways to tackle to this ambitious problem is to set the number of spacetime dimensions as a parameter in order to clarify the characteristic properties of the four - dimensional spacetime . in this context",
    ", lovelock higher - curvature gravity plays an important role because it is the most natural generalization of general relativity in higher dimensions as the second - order partial differential equations without torsion  @xcite . among all the classes of lovelock gravity , the second - order lovelock gravity , so called the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity is particularly interesting not only because it is the simplest non - trivial lovelock gravity but also because it is realized in the low - energy limit of heterotic string theory  @xcite .    up to now , not many rigorous results have been established on the generic properties of lovelock gravity . under the present circumstance ,",
    "the analysis in the symmetric spacetime must be completed to give a firm base for the subsequent study in the less symmetric spacetime .",
    "hence the @xmath2-dimensional spacetime having symmetries corresponding to the isometries of an @xmath1-dimensional constant curvature space has been intensively investigated .",
    "the active study of the gauss - bonnet black holes was triggered by the discovery of the exact black - hole solution by boulware and deser and independently by wheeler  @xcite .",
    "this solution has been generalized to the topological case with a cosmological constant as well as the electric charge  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the birkhoff s theorem can be generalized in this system  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamical aspects  @xcite and dynamical stability of the black hole  @xcite have been fully investigated and now the gauss - bonnet black hole attracts a keen interest from the viewpoint of gauge / gravity correspondence  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical aspects of the gauss - bonnet black holes have been recently studied  @xcite .",
    "( see  @xcite for recent reviews . )",
    "one of the characteristic properties of the higher - order lovelock gravity is that the gravitational equations contain the riemann tensors explicitly , while the einstein tensor is written only with the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar .",
    "this means that the curvature - effect appears more sharply in the higher - order lovelock gravity .",
    "this fact is explicitly shown in the solution obtained by dotti and gleiser in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity  @xcite . in general relativity , if we replace the @xmath1-dimensional space of positive constant curvature in the schwarzschild - tangherlini spacetime by _ any _ @xmath1-dimensional einstein space with positive curvature , the resulting spacetime is still a solution of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "however , it is not the case in higher - order lovelock gravity .",
    "dotti and gleiser obtained a @xmath0-dimensional black - hole solution of which @xmath1-dimensional submanifold is not a constant curvature space but an einstein space satisfying a certain condition on its weyl tensor .",
    "the effect of the weyl tensor appears in the metric function as a parameter and makes the spacetime geometry quite non - trivial .",
    "the dotti - gleiser black hole is very important to clarify the nature of the higher - curvature effects .",
    "the final goal of this paper is to analyze the thermodynamical aspects of the dotti - gleiser black hole , which has not been done yet . not only because the spacetime has a non - trivial boundary but also because the contribution of the weyl tensor appears as the slow fall - off in the metric function , we first face the problem of the definition of mass for this black hole . for this purpose ,",
    "we take the quasi - local mass approach . in our recent papers where @xmath1-dimensional submanifold is of constant curvature",
    ", we showed that the results in general relativity can be generalized in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity in a unified manner by introducing a well - defined quasi - local mass  @xcite . that quasi - local mass is a natural generalization of the misner - sharp mass in general relativity , which is considered to be the best one in the spherically symmetric spacetime  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , we will show that a further generalization of this results is possible for the case where the @xmath1-dimensional submanifold is an einstein space satisfying the condition by dotti and gleiser . reading off the black - hole mass by the generalized misner - sharp mass",
