    "single - electron spin in nanoscale systems is a promising building block for both processors and memory storage devices in future spin - logic applications.@xcite in particular great attention has been given to quantum dots ( qds ) , which are among the best candidates to implement quantum bit gates for quantum computation.@xcite in these systems the spin coherence time can be orders of magnitude longer than the charge coherence times,@xcite a feature which allows one to perform a large number of operations before the spin - coherence is lost .",
    "another advantage of using qds is the possibility of manipulating their electronic spectrum with , e.g. , external magnetic fields and gate voltages , and fine - tuning the characteristic time - scales of the system .    for practical applications , it is important to achieve full control of the ultrafast dynamics of qd systems after the sudden switch - on of an external perturbation . to this end the study of the time evolution of spin - polarized currents and the characterization of the spin - decoherence time is crucial .",
    "the theoretical study of the transient regime is also relevant in the light of recent progresses in the time - resolution of dynamical responses at the nanoscale .",
    "novel techniques like transient current spectroscopy@xcite and time - resolved faraday rotation@xcite allow us to follow the microscopic dynamics at the sub - picosecond time - scale .",
    "these advances may open completely new scenarios with respect to those at the steady - state .",
    "for instance , transient coherent quantum beats of the spin dynamics in semiconductor qd s have been observed after a circularly polarized optical excitation,@xcite and theoretically addressed by souza.@xcite we also mention a recent experiment on split - gate quantum point contacts in which the measured quantum capacitance in the transient regime was six orders of magnitude larger than in the steady - state.@xcite    another attracting feature of magnetic qds is their use as spin - devices in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) .",
    "different orientations of the polarization of ferromagnetic leads results in spin - dependent tunneling rates and hence in a nonvanishing tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) . in recent experiments@xcite",
    "the inverse tmr effect ( tmr @xmath0 ) has been observed and various models have been proposed to address such phenomenon.@xcite    in this paper we study the time - dependent transport through a single level quantum dot connected to normal and ferromagnetic leads . in order to get a sensible transient regime , we adopt the so - called partition - free approach , in which the electrode - qd - electrode system is assumed to be in equilibrium before the external bias is switched on.@xcite spin - symmetry breaking terms ( like spin - flip scatterings and spin - dependent dot - leads hoppings ) are included@xcite and this requires the time - propagation of a genuine two - component spinor .",
    "explicit calculations are performed both in the case of non - interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) leads of finite length and in the wide - band - limit approximation ( wbla ) . in the wbla",
    "we derive a closed analytic formula for the exact spin - resolved time - dependent current , which can be expressed as the sum of a steady - state and a transient contribution .",
    "the latter consists of a term which only contains transitions between the qd levels and the electrochemical potentials ( _ resonant - continuum _ ) , and a term which only contains intra - dot transitions ( _ resonant - resonant _ ) .",
    "remarkably these two terms are damped over two different time - scales , with the resonant - continuum transitions longer lived than the resonant - resonant transitions . we further show that , going beyond the wbla , extra transitions occur .",
    "these involve the top / bottom of the 1d electrode bands and might be relevant for narrow - band electrodes .    for qds connected to normal leads we study the quantum beat phenomenon in the presence of intra - dot spin - flip coupling of strength @xmath1 .",
    "we show that the amplitude of the beats is suppressed independently of the structure of the leads ( wbla and 1d leads ) .",
    "in addition we show how to engineer the spin - polarization of the total current by exploiting the full knowledge of the time - dependent response of the system . by applying a periodic pulse of proper period ,",
    "we provide numerical evidence of oscillating spin - polarizations with amplitude two orders of magnitude larger than in the dc case .",
    "finally , in the case of ferromagnetic electrodes we study the steady - state tmr and the conditions for its inversion . treating the leads in the wbla",
    "we derive a simple formula for the tmr in linear response .",
    "noticeably , in the presence of spin flip interactions there is a critical value of the polarization of the ferromagnetic leads above which the tmr is negative even for symmetric contacts to the left / right leads .",
    "this provides an alternative mechanism for the tmr inversion .",
    "the above scenario is qualitatively different with 1d leads , e.g. , the tmr can be negative already for @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we introduce the lead - qd - lead model . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we employ the wbla and derive an exact formula for the time - dependent current in the presence of spin - symmetry breaking terms .",
    "we present explicit results both for normal and ferromagnetic leads , focussing on transient quantum beats ( normal ) and the tmr ( ferromagnetic ) . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we address the above phenomena in the case of 1d leads and engineer the dynamical spin responses . here",
    "we also describe the numerical framework employed to compute the time - dependent evolution of the system .",
    "the summary and main conclusions are drawn in section [ secv ] .",
    "we consider the system illustrated in fig.[device ] which consists of a single - level qd contacted with 1d left ( @xmath3 ) and right ( @xmath4 ) electrodes .",
    "the latter are described by the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of sites of lead @xmath7 , the nearest - neighbor hopping integral is @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron on site @xmath10 of the lead @xmath11 with spin @xmath12 . in the case of ferromagnetic leads ,",
    "we distinguish between two configurations , one with parallel ( p ) and the other with antiparallel ( ap ) magnetization of the two leads . in order to model these two different alignments we use the stoner prescription according to which the on - site energies are     with majority spin @xmath13 electrons and the lead @xmath4 with majority spin @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) electrons in the p ( ap ) configurations are separated from the qd by tunnel barriers which are accounted for with a renormalized hopping @xmath15 .",
    "the energy - spin - splitting is @xmath16 in the leads and @xmath17 in the qd .",
    "spin - flip scatterings of strength @xmath1 occur in the qd.,height=94 ]    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the band spin splitting . in the above model the p configuration corresponds to a majority - spin electron with spin @xmath20 in both leads , while in the ap configuration the majority - spin electron have spin @xmath20 in lead @xmath3 and spin @xmath21 in lead @xmath4 .",
    "the case of normal leads corresponds to @xmath22 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum dot reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 annihilates ( creates ) an electron on the qd with spin @xmath12 and @xmath1 is responsible for intra - dot spin - flip scatterings .",
    "the on - site energy @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is an intra - dot energy splitting .",
    "the quantum dot is connected to the leads via the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath28 with @xmath29 the amplitude for an electron in the qd with spin @xmath12 to hop to the first site of lead @xmath11 with spin @xmath30 .",
    "alternatively , one can express @xmath31 in terms of the one - body eigenstates of @xmath32 labelled by @xmath33 , @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "putting all terms together the hamiltonian of the whole system in equilibrium reads @xmath36    in the next two sections we study out - of - equilibrium properties of the system described in eq.([htot ] ) , after a sudden switch - on of a bias voltage @xmath37 in lead @xmath38 .",
    "we calculate the time - dependent spin - polarized current @xmath39 flowing between the qd and lead @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath39 is defined as the variation of the total number of particles @xmath40 of spin @xmath12 in lead @xmath11 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the dot - lead lesser green s function of the contacted non - equilibrium system , and @xmath43 stands for the real part . unless otherwise stated , the current is computed at the @xmath3 interface and the short - hand notation @xmath44 is used for the spin - polarized current while @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the total current and spin current respectively .",
    "we further specialize to constant biases @xmath47 , except in section [ ivb ] where the bias is a periodic pulse .",
    "therefore we define @xmath48 , while the value of @xmath49 is either 0 or @xmath50 .",
    "the numerical simulations have been performed using dot - leads hoppings independent of @xmath11 ( symmetric contacts ) .",
    "we show that , despite the symmetry between @xmath3 and @xmath4 leads , the sign of the steady - state tmr can be inverted , a property which has been so far ascribed to strongly asymmetric tunneling barriers.@xcite moreover we specialize eq.([ht ] ) to the case @xmath51 , and @xmath52",
    ". however we note that spin - flip scatterings are accounted for by considering a finite intra - dot @xmath1 which is taken to be real in this work .",
    "if not otherwise specified , the initial fermi energy @xmath53 of both leads is set to 0 ( half - filled electrodes ) . in the numerical calculations below all energies",
    "are measured in units of @xmath8 ( @xmath54 is the bandwidth of the leads ) , times are measured in units of @xmath55 and currents in units of @xmath56 with @xmath57 the electron charge .",
    "here we study the model introduced in the previous section within the wbla .",
    "this approximation has been mostly used to study spinless electrons and a closed formula for the exact time - dependent current has been derived.@xcite below we generalize these results to systems where the spin symmetry is broken .",
    "the retarded green s function projected onto the qd can be expressed in terms of the embedding self - energy @xmath58 which is a @xmath59 matrix in spin space . in eq.([self ] ) @xmath60 accounts for virtual processes where an electron on the qd hops to lead @xmath11 by changing its spin from @xmath12 to @xmath61 , and hops back to the qd with final spin @xmath30 . exploiting the dyson equation",
    "the expression of @xmath60 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the retarded green s function of the uncontacted @xmath11 lead expressed in term of the one - particle eigenenergies @xmath64 . in the wbla eq.([selfexp ] ) becomes @xmath65 i.e. , the self - energy is independent of frequency .",
    "the @xmath66 matrices @xmath67 s have the physical meaning of spin - dependent tunneling rates and account for spin - flip processes between the leads and the qd .",
    "we wish to point out that each @xmath68 matrix must be positive semi - definite for a proper modeling of the wbla .",

    "\\label{trans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    few remarks about eq.([trans ] ) are in order . in linear response theory only the contribution of the first line remains .",
    "such contribution is responsible for transient oscillations which are exponentially damped over a timescale @xmath83 and have frequencies @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , are the two eigenvalues of @xmath87 .",
    "these oscillations originate from virtual transitions between the resonant levels of the qd and the fermi level of the biased continua ( _ resonant - continuum _ ) .",
    "no information about the intra - dot transitions ( _ resonant - resonant _ ) is here contained .",
    "resonant - resonant transitions are instead described by the contribution of the second line of eq.([trans ] ) which yields oscillations of frequency @xmath88 damped as @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 both diagonal in spin space , eq.([itot ] ) decouples into two identical formulae ( but with different parameters ) , which exactly reproduce the well - known spinless result.@xcite    below we consider diagonal matrices @xmath92 , in agreement with the discussion at the end of section [ sec1 ] .",
    "thus , all spin - flip scatterings occur in the quantum dot .",
    "the ferromagnetic nature of the leads is accounted for by modeling the @xmath68 matrices as@xcite @xmath93 where all the remaining matrix elements are vanishing and @xmath94 is proportional to the polarization of the leads .",
    "moreover we assume that @xmath95 does not depend on @xmath11 , yielding a left / right symmetry in absence of ferromagnetism .",
    "in this section we consider a quantum dot with an intra - dot energy splitting @xmath27 between the @xmath20 and @xmath21 levels , and an intra - dot spin - flip energy @xmath1 .",

    "this follows from the invariance of the normal electrode hamiltonians ( @xmath96 ) and of the tunneling hamiltonian ( @xmath116 ) under rotations in spin - space .",

    "this calls for a deep understanding of the time - dependent responses in these systems .    in this paper",
    "we have calculated spin - dependent out - of - equilibrium properties of lead - qd - lead junctions .",
    "realistic transient responses are obtained within the partition - free approach .",
    "the time - dependent current is calculated for qds connected to ferromagnetic leads and in the presence of an intra - dot spin flip interaction .",

    "we evolve exactly a system with a finite number @xmath6 of sites in each lead .",
    "if @xmath6 is sufficiently large , reliable time - evolutions are obtained during a time much larger than all the characteristic time - scales of the infinite system.@xcite by comparing our results against the ones obtained with leads of infinite length,@xcite we have verified that our method is accurate and robust , beside being very easy to implement .",
    "we have solved analytically the time - dependent problem in the wbla and derived a closed formula for the spin - polarized current .",
    "such formula generalizes the one obtained in the spin - diagonal case and has a transparent interpretation.@xcite we stress , however , that within the wbla , transitions involving the top or the bottom of the leads band are not accounted for .",
    "the latter may be relevant to characterize , e.g , the coherent beat oscillations when the device is attached to narrow - band electrodes .",
    "furthermore we have shown how to engineer the transient response of the system to enhance the spin - polarization of the current through the qd .",
    "this is achieved by controlling parameters like , e.g. , the external magnetic field , the transparency of the contacts , and imposing a pulsed bias of optimal period .",
    "it is shown that by exploiting the synergy between the pauli - blockade phenomenon and the resonant - continuum frequency mismatch , one can achieve an ac spin - polarization two orders of magnitude larger than the dc one .",
    "we also have employed the stoner model to describe ferromagnetic leads and computed the steady - state tmr . we have found a novel regime of negative tmr , in which the geometry of the tunnel junction is not required to be asymmetric and a finite intra - dot spin - flip interaction turns out to be crucial . for any given @xmath1",
    "there is a critical value of the ferromagnetic polarization above which the tmr is negative .",
    "the magnitude of the tmr is very sensitive to temperature variations and the tmr inversion phenomenon disappears as @xmath278 approaches the damping - time of the system .",
    "we would like to stress that our approach is not limited to 1d electrodes and can be readily generalized to investigate multi - terminal devices consisting of several multi - level qds . finally , owning to the fact that the propagation algorithm is based on a one - particle scheme",
