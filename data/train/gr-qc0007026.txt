    "as the main goal of the _ algebrodynamical _ approach @xcite , we regard the derivation of equations of physical fields ( or of fundamental physical laws , in a broader sense ) from a unique primary _ principle of purely abstract nature _ , based only on the intrinsic properties of exclusive mathematical structures ( groups , algebras , mappings etc . ) .",
    "basic realization of this concept developed in @xcite makes use of only the _ differentiability conditions _ of functions of _ biquaternionic variable _ ,",
    "i.e. of the cauchy - riemann ( cr ) equations generalized to the case of noncommutative ( associative ) algebras .    in the framework of the version of analysis proposed in @xcite",
    "the noncommutativity of starting algebra naturally results in the nonlinearity of generalized cr equations ( gcre ) , justifying the use of the latters as the dynamical equations of _ interacting _ fields .",
    "infact , for the algebra of biquaternions @xmath0 ( isomorphic to the full @xmath1 complex matrix algebra ) the gcre appear to be lorentz invariant and carry natural 2-spinor and gauge structures . in the most examined case",
    "for which a simple geometric and physical interpretation is obvious , the conditions of _",
    "@xmath0-differentiability _ reduce to the invariant system @xcite @xmath2 for @xmath3-valued 2-spinor @xmath4 and gauge @xmath5 fields represented by @xmath6 and @xmath1 @xmath3-matrices respectively .",
    "@xmath7 in ( 1 ) denotes usual matrix multiplication ( equivalent to that in @xmath0 ) , and @xmath8 represents a @xmath1 hermitian matrix of the increments of coordinates .    as a consequence of ( 1 ) each component of the 2-spinor",
    "@xmath9 satisfy the 4-eikonal equation @xcite . on the other hand , the _ compatibility conditions _ @xmath10 impose dynamical restrictions on the gauge field @xmath5 .",
    "namely , the @xmath11 matrix @xmath3-valued _ connection 1-form _ @xmath12 ( @xmath13 being the pauli matrices ) by virtue of compatibility conditions * should be self - dual*. consequently , * free maxwell and yang - mills equations are satistied * identically on the solutions of ( 1 ) , for the scalar @xmath14 and the vector @xmath15 parts of the connection ( 2 ) respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , the gcre system ( 1 ) exhibit wonderful relations to several fundamental physical equations being for the latters in some sense generating .    in the approach regarded , an important role is performed by _",
    "singular sets _ where the strengths of maxwell and ym fields turn to infinity .",
    "such sets were found to have diverse dimensions and topology .",
    "solutions with _",
    "compact _ structure of singular set may be then considered as _ particle - like _ , the evolution of such singularities - particles being then governed by the system ( 1 ) itself .    in this paper , we expound the process of reduction of system ( 1 ) to the equations of _ shear - free geodesic null congruences _ and , by kerr theorem , to the solution of _ algebraic _ equation @xcite . making use of this ,",
    "we present an explicit form of the solutions to free maxwell equations , analyze the structure and evolution of their singular set and discuss the relation of these electromagnetic fields to the kerr - shild metrics and , by this , to the solutions of electrovacuum einstein - maxwell equations . in conclusion",
    ", we consider general status and physical interpretation of `` particle - like ''  singular solutions in the framework of electrogravidynamics and of unified algebraic field theory proposed .",
    "through the elimination of the gauge field @xmath5 the system of gcre ( 1 ) may be written in a 2-spinor form @xcite @xmath16 in the gauge @xmath17 the system ( 3 ) reduces to two equations for one unknown function @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 being the _ spinor coordinates_. note that as a consequence of ( 4 ) @xmath18 satisfy identically both the 4-eikonal and dalembert wave equations @xcite . assuming the eqs .",
    "( 4 ) are solved , the components of 4-potential matrix @xmath21 may be expressed through the function @xmath18 as @xmath22 and satisfy free maxwell equations .    wonderfully , eqs.(4 )",
    "are completely identical to the equations of _ shear - free null geodesic congruences _ in the gauge for the spinor @xmath4 regarded @xcite . in accord with kerr s theorem @xcite , we then obtain the general solution of eqs.(4 ) in an implicit algebraic form @xmath23 @xmath24 being an arbitrary golomorphic function of three complex variables including two _ twistor _ ( projective ) components @xmath25 thus , a lot of solutions to free maxwell equations may be obtained through simply examining of the algebraic eq.(6 ) .",
    "singularities of related field strengths may be then found from the _ caustic _ condition @xmath26 eliminating the only unknown function @xmath18 from two algebraic eqs.(6),(8 ) , one easily comes to the _ equation of singular set _ which determines the shape and evolution of singularities , without even taking care of explicit solving the eq.(6 ) itself .",
    "the example of such procedure was presented in @xcite .",
    "from the structure of twistor components ( 7 ) it s evident that stationary solutions to eq.(6 ) are exhausted by the functions @xmath27 , where @xmath28 does nt contain the time variable @xmath29 at all . in accord with the results of kerr and wilson @xcite , for stationary solutions with * compact * structure of singular set the function @xmath30",
    "* should be at most quadratic in @xmath31 * , i.e. should have the form @xmath32 .",
    "linear dependence on @xmath31 immediately leads to the trivial solution with zero fields . using 3-translations and 3-rotations",
    ", the above form may be reduced to @xmath33 for which we obtain from quadratic eq.(6 ) @xmath34 for a real valued @xmath35 from ( 9 ) and the expression for potentials ( 5 ) we obtain the coulomb electric field with a point singularity and a * fixed value of the electric charge * as a consequence of nonlinear primary system of gcre ( 1 ) .",
    "imaginary values of @xmath35 correspond to the _ ring singularity _ with radius @xmath36 and multipole structure of em fields with coulomb first main term @xcite . decomposition and separation of real parts of em fields at a distance @xmath37",
    "gives @xmath38 @xmath39 contrary to an ambiguous value of ring s radius @xmath35 , the dimensionless electric charge is strictly fixed ( up to a sign ) by field equations , so that in absolute units it may be identified with _",
    "elementary charge _",
    "note that the solution ( 9 ) ( for the case @xmath41 ) and the property of charge quantization for the gcre system ( 1 ) have been obtained in a direct way in @xcite .",
    "( recently @xcite there were some interesting attempts to explain electric charge quantization by topological reasons instead of dynamical considerations used here ) .    on the other hand , solution ( 9 ) is extremely important in the framework of gtr .",
    "indeed , the expression @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the 2-spinor related to the function @xmath18 , defines the _ principal null congruences _   @xmath44 of a riemannian space - time endowed with a kerr - shild metric @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the metric of auxiliary minkowski space - time .",
    "the scalar factor @xmath47 should be then determined by the einstein vacuum or electrovacuum equations and for fundamental stationary solution ( 9 ) leads to the kerr or kerr - newman metrics respectively ( consequently , to the schwarzschild or reissner - nordstrm metrics for the case @xmath35=0 ) . in our approach",
    ", it is of great importance that * singularities of curvature of metric ( 10 ) are fixed @xcite by the same condition ( 8) as for electromagnetic field * and define infact one unique particle - like object .",
    "another wonderful fact is that for the kerr - newman solution of einstein - maxwell equations electromagnetic fields are just those defined by the gcre system ( apart from the property of quantization of charge for the latters ! ) and may be asymptotically presented by the eq.(10 ) .",
    "moreover , these fields * obey maxwell equations both in flat space and in riemannian space with kerr - shild metric ( 11 ) ! * such a remarkable _ property of stability _ of electromagnetic fields under kerr - shild deformations of space - time geometry noticed in @xcite will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "making use of correspondence between the fundamental solution ( 9 ) to the gcre system ( 1 ) and the kerr - newman solution of einstein - maxwell system , one is able to endow the solution ( 9 ) with a complete set of quantum numbers ( including mass and spin ) .",
    "then the _ gyromagnetic ratio _ would automatically correspond to that for dirac particle , while the charge would be fixed in magnitude .",
    "unfortunately , no natural reasons to ensure the quantization of mass could be seen nowadays .",
    "we ll continue the discussion below .",
    "let us consider the general quadratic form of the function @xmath24 .",
    "when the terms bilinear in @xmath48 , @xmath49 are absent , such functions ( under the restriction on singular set to be compact ) correspond to the boosted or rotated kerr solution @xcite . on the other hand , the function",
    "@xmath50 has been considered in detail in @xcite . the explicit expression for @xmath31 in this case",
    "is @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "em fields correspondent to ( 12 ) are @xmath53 for real @xmath54 the fields ( 13 ) are identical to the well - known _ born solution _ for two point - like charged `` particles '' performing uniformly accelerated counter - motion . the value of electric charge for each particle does not depend on @xmath54 being * fixed and equal to the charge of fundamental solution ( 9)*. for the case of imaginary @xmath54 one has the singularity of rather exotic toroidal structure , defined by the equation @xmath55 ( see @xcite for details )",
    ". in general case of complex - valued @xmath54 singular set manifests itself as the two rings of fixed radii performing again the oncoming hyperbolic motion along @xmath56-axis .",
    "it may be proved that ( up to the transformations of poincare group ) the _ axisymmetric _ solutions to the eq.(6 ) ( and to the gcre system ( 1 ) respectively ! ) generated by quadratic function @xmath30 * are exhausted by the kerr - like solution ( 9 ) and the nonstationary bisingular solution ( 12 ) * together with ( toroidal or double ring - like ) modifications of the latter .",
    "it seems , however , that the solutions to gcre with compact singularity and non - axial symmetries may be of interest too . here",
    "we present an example of such solution which may be obtained from the generating function @xmath57 . resolving the equation @xmath58",
    ", one comes to the following expression @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the singular set for this solution is defined by the condition @xmath62 and for @xmath63 has the form of flat _ figure `` 8 ''   curve _ ( fig.a )  ) .",
    "the time evolution of this singularity is illustrated by fig.b ) .",
    "a )  t=0  b )  t=1   [ pic1 ]    em fields related to the solution ( 14 ) and being represented by the complex combination @xmath64 are :    @xmath65    for each finite moment of time they decrease rapidly ( as @xmath66 ) with the distance from the centre of singularity",
    ". the fields are neutral ( with total charge being equal to zero ) and null ( @xmath67 ) .    in conclusion , we present a peculiar solution with noncompact singularity which serves as the _ analogue of electromagnetic wave _ in grce dynamics . for the solutions of wave - like type the generating function @xmath30 should depend only on one twistor component , say , @xmath48 .",
    "then , for the equation @xmath68 the initial distribution of @xmath69 may be arbitrary fixed at @xmath70 , i.e. at the @xmath71-axis .",
    "choosing for the latter the _ monochromatic _ dependence and resolving the equation @xmath72 , where the parameters @xmath73 are assumed to be real and positive , we find    @xmath74 @xmath75 being the principal branch of the so called _ lambert _   function which is the solution of the equation @xmath76 .",
    "the structure of singular set is simply derived after that and appears to be a neutral _ helix _ of radius @xmath77 and of lead @xmath78 propagating along @xmath71- direction with the speed of light .",
    "electromagnetic fields are mutually orphogonal and transversal while polarization depends on the distance from the axis . in the direction perpendicular to the axis the fields fall at large distancies as @xmath79 .",
    "as before , the fields are globally defined only up to a sign .",
    "shear - free null geodesic congruences @xmath44 and the kerr - shild metrics ( 12 ) may be associated with the nonstationary solutions above - presented up to the scalar factor @xmath47 . at present",
    "it s not clear if the latter may be choosed so that the einstein - maxwell electrovacuum system would be satisfied . by this , an interesting representation @xcite for the shear - free congruences ( through consideration of null cone emanated by the source moving along some curve in _ complex space _ ) as well as",
    "the _ condition of stability _ for electromagnetic fields under the kerr - schild deformations of space - time geometry @xcite may be of great use .",
    "well - known are the numerous problems arising in gtr and in quantum field theory in respect to the singularities of solutions of field equations ( violation of causality @xcite , divergences etc . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "just the naked singularity of kerr - newman solution ( which appears instead of black hole solution in the case of a large angular moment ) manifests itself many remarkable properties related to that of elementary particles .",
    "accordingly , several attempts to construct the model of electron on the base of kerr - type solutions ( kts ) have been undertaken @xcite .",
    "however , they all dealt with the problem of physically suitable _ source _ for kts to be found which is tigthly related to the well - known _ twovaluedness _ of kerr - like geometry and electromagnetic fields in particular .",
    "infact , the introduction of source becomes admissible only after the _ cut _ of space which restore the global uniqueness of the @xmath3-valued functions representing the fields of kts .",
    "unfortunately , the surface of cut is quite ambigious : it may be either the _ disk _ spanning the kerr singular ring @xcite or the oblate spheroid @xcite covering the singular ring on which the kerr - newman metric turns surprisingly into the minkowski one .",
    "consequently , one may think of the source of kts as of the `` rotating relativistic disk '' , of the `` bubble of flat geometry '' within the external kerr - newman space - time etc .",
    "thus , we are to conclude that * there are no grounds to speak about the `` source ''   of kts solutions at all * since the twovaluedness is the unavoidable feature of their internal mathematical structure .    to illustrate the above statement , let us consider a simplier case of the singular `` particle - like ''   solutions to free maxwell equations in flat space - time presented in this paper .",
    "note that all of them ( apart from the coulomb and born solutions with point - like singularities ) are of the same two - valued structure being in each point defined up to a sign .",
    "certainly , by no @xmath80- function distribution of charge and current along the singular curve one can reproduce the field distribution in the whole space .",
    "on the other hand , such solutions are locally well defined and may be analytically continuated from the region of regularity so that the full structure of singular set is established * in a unique way*. one can not in any way change either the shape and topology of the singularity or its time evolution ( the latter property being the most important from physical point of view ) .",
    "suppose we really hope to describe the interactions and transmutations of elementary particles by means of the solutions regarded ( which are rather to be _ multisingular _ for real physical process ) .",
    "then we ll proceed in well - defined and unique predictions in spite of partial indefinitness of em fields and escape any divergences at all !",
    "moreover , one may think of such solutions as of * the only possibility to explain the `` spin 1/2 ''   structure * at a purely classical level and with transparent picture of space - time dynamics being preserved .",
    "this is still more true in the framework of the algebrodynamical approach we develop , at least for two reasons .",
    "the first one is that in respect to the internal structure of gcre system ( 1 ) , gauge ( electromagnetic plus yang - mills ) fields stand there hand by hand with the 2-spinor structure so that the latter appears naturally together with maxwell equations .",
    "the second reason is that , apart from the right value of gyromagnetic ratio , the value of electric charge is automatically fixed by the field equations themselves .    of course , the stationary kts as well as bisingular and `` figure 8 ''   solutions presented here can say nothing about real dynamics of an ansamble of compact `` particle - like ''   singularities .",
    "even the problem of interaction of two kerr - newman objects is far from solution . in the framework of algebrodynamics the overdetermined structure of gcre",
    "impose restrictions even on the initial distribution of the fields @xcite so that the scattering problem should be fully reformulated .",
    "historically , the solution of maxwell equations with ring singularity have been obtained by appel in 1887 and revived in the works of newman and burinskii @xcite .",
    "general study of singular solution to maxwell equations have been undertaken by bateman @xcite .",
    "nowadays the concept of naked singularities of kts as the model for elementary particles is successfully developed , say , in the works of clement @xcite .    to conclude , we argue that hostile attitude of physicists to singularities of field equations could be quite unjustified .",
    "there exist no restrictions of principal character for the _ compact multisingular _ solutions to describe the interactions of particle - like objects in a self - consistent way .",
    "then their transmutations could be treated as _",
    "perestroikas _ of singularities in terms of catastrophe theory .",
    "this programme should be implemented independently both in the framework of einstein - maxwell dynamics and of the algebraic dynamics based in particular on the gcre system ( 1 ) ."
