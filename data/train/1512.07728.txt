    "historically , a survey of the linear polarization arising due to coherent scattering , carried out by @xcite over the wavelength range 31654230 of the solar spectrum , revealed the nature and influence of the blend lines on the second solar spectrum ( the polarized solar spectrum that is produced by scattering processes ) .",
    "they introduced an empirical relation between the intensity and polarization profiles of intrinsically unpolarized lines .",
    "based on this model , they could obtain a good determination of both the zero - point of the polarization scale and the level of continuum polarization , and could further use the model to remove the effect of the depolarizing blend lines and the continuum polarization to bring out the intrinsic polarization of the spectral lines in the second solar spectrum .",
    "the high resolution recording of the second solar spectrum by @xcite and the atlas of @xcite also explicitly showed the importance of blend lines and the polarizing continuum .",
    "the highly structured second solar spectrum is characterized by a polarized background continuum on which both intrinsically polarizing and depolarizing blend lines are superposed .",
    "while a relative polarimetric precision of @xmath0 can routinely be achieved in current imaging stokes polarimetry , a direct observational determination of the zero - point of the polarization scale is not possible with comparable accuracy .",
    "instead the zero - point , which is needed to convert the observed relative polarizations to absolute polarizations , has to be determined by theoretical considerations based on the expected polarization shapes of the depolarizing blend lines .",
    "for this reason the blend lines are of fundamental importance for all observational and theoretical work with the second solar spectrum .",
    "the blend line model that was proposed in @xcite was later applied in a somewhat extended way in @xcite for the empirical determination of the polarization of the continuous spectrum based on gandorfer s atlas .",
    "the theoretical modelling of the line polarization in the second solar spectrum is always associated with incorporating the depolarizing blend lines , as they invariably affect the shapes of the polarized main lines .",
    "blend lines are usually treated by assuming that they are formed in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) conditions , thereby ignoring their own intrinsic polarization . when blend lines are treated in lte , polarized line and continuum photons are removed due to larger absorption within the line , causing a depolarization of the main line and the continuum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a theoretical study by @xcite on the depolarizing blend lines in the visible solar spectrum showed that the relative intensity and relative polarization profiles defined with respect to the continuum , are approximately proportional to each other , with a proportionality constant that varies with angle , wavelength , and line strength .",
    "the blend lines can be treated in lte if their height of formation corresponds to collision - dominated layers .",
    "if they are formed in low density layers , it may be necessary to treat them as being formed under non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) conditions .",
    "analysis by @xcite also showed that the depolarization of continuum by absorbing blend lines rapidly decreases with increasing height of formation , while the depolarization by scattering blend lines increases with height of formation .",
    "these calculations were performed with realistic model atmospheres , and hypothetical or real line profiles formed in these atmospheres .",
    "although the blend lines were treated in nlte , their intrinsic polarizability factor was assumed to be zero ( namely the blend lines do not have linear polarization of their own ) .",
    "when they have a non - zero polarizability factor , it may also become necessary to treat their intrinsic polarization , to represent their contribution to the polarization profile of the main line ( depolarization or repolarization ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider blend lines with intrinsic polarization , which occur in the wings of the main lines .",
    "the number density of strongly polarizing lines is modest in the visible part of the second solar spectrum .",
    "therefore , the conditions that we have envisaged in this paper ( namely the proximity of polarizing main and blend lines ) is not often realized .",
    "however , as we go down in the uv , the second solar spectrum gets increasingly more crowded with strongly polarizing lines .",
    "there we can find several good examples of polarizing blend lines ( see the uv atlas of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , the theoretical studies presented in this paper become relevant in the analysis of the scattering polarization of the lines in the uv region of the second solar spectrum .",
    "blend lines belonging to different elements ` interact ' with the main line of interest through radiative transfer effects ( i.e. , they couple to the main line through the opacity distribution and multiple scattering ) .",
    "the strength of this interaction depends on their wavelength separation .",
    "this interaction is an example of incoherent superposition of the lines . on the other hand , the interaction between the line components of multiplets like caii h&k , nai d@xmath1&d@xmath2 , cri 52045208 multiplet etc .",

    "the same formalism can be extended to deal with the cases where there is more than one blend line .",
    "we formulate the radiative transfer equation in the irreducible tensorial basis .",
    "this transfer equation is then solved by computing the scalar intensity with the standard fbf iterative technique , and the polarization by a faster , promising method called sem . in the sem , the polarized component of the source vector is expanded in neumann series .",
    "single scattered solution is computed at first , and this solution is then used for calculating the higher order scattering terms .",
    "the dependence of the blend line intensity and polarization effects on various parameters like polarizability factor , distance from the main line core , blend line strength , isothermal slab optical thickness , continuum opacity and polarization , magnetic field , and elastic collision rate has been explored in detail .",
    "the blend lines in the linearly polarized spectrum of the sun invariably affect the main spectral lines .",
    "a knowledge of the way in which this interaction takes place plays an important role in the interpretation of the second solar spectrum .",
    "the insight that we have gained through our theoretical studies using isothermal slab models is a first step towards realistic modelling of the second solar spectrum .",
    "such calculations become necessary in a fine analysis of the solar spectrum , and help in our studies of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the papers by @xcite and @xcite form the basis for the inclusion of intrinsically polarized blend lines in modeling the second solar spectrum .",
