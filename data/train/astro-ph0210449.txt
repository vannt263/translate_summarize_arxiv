    "system temperatures ( referred to above the atmosphere ) were @xmath29 and @xmath30 at 3 mm and 1 mm , respectively .",
    "we tuned the 3 mm receivers to 90.81ghz , the frequency of the redshifted co(32 ) line for @xmath22 , and the 1 mm receivers to a line - free region at 235.00ghz corresponding to a rest wavelength of @xmath0 .",

    "we therefore retuned the 1 mm receivers to 211.83ghz , the frequency of the redshifted co(76 ) line , and deployed four correlator modules ( giving 559mhz of continuous bandwidth ) at both 3 mm and 1 mm .",
    "the pointing center was also changed by @xmath32 for the 2002 observations , to agree with the co(32 ) centroid ( @xmath33 ( j2000 ) @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( j2000 ) @xmath36 ) measured by @xcite .",

    "once the source data were calibrated , we precessed the 1998 visibilities to the 2002 phase center . after confirming our nondetection of co(76 ) emission , we rescaled the 2002 1 mm continuum visibilities from 211.83 to 235.00 ghz using a power law index of 3 derived from ( sub)millimeter photometry @xcite .",
    "we then combined the 1998 and 2002 @xmath37 data , yielding a total of 40 distinct baselines ( 24331 m ) from the three array configurations , and smoothed the co(32 ) data to @xmath38 resolution .",

    "the observed total flux density of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 for a 20% uncertainty in the flux scale ) agrees well with the value ( 8.5mjy ) expected from jcmt photometry at 850 and @xmath45 , suggesting that the interferometer has resolved out little if any emission .",

    "an additional tail of emission extending @xmath50 wsw from the central peak may be associated with extended @xmath51 emission detected by @xcite , and with another fainter @xmath42-band emission peak ( figure [ f - cont ] ) .",
    "the @xmath49 size of the central dust source in j02399 is about three times larger than the sizes of local ulirgs @xcite .",
    "this fact may not be surprising , however , given that j02399 is about ten times more luminous than the typical local ulirg . since the star - forming interstellar medium in ulirgs is thought to consist of a high volume filling factor distribution of dense gas and dust @xcite , a ten times larger star formation rate requires a ten times larger volume of star - forming regions .",

    "the coincidence of the far - ir centroid with the uv and x - ray continuum peaks within the combined astrometric uncertainties of @xmath52 suggests that l1 is indeed the primary origin of j02399 s dust emission .",
    "the ( bluer ) uv continuum and @xmath53 emission peak l2 , in contrast , has no associated dust emission ; this supports the idea that l2 is primarily scattered agn light from l1 @xcite , rather than a second galaxy in the early stages of a merger with l1 @xcite .",
    "in fact , there may be an anticorrelation between the fainter rest uv emission and the @xmath0 continuum emission , suggesting that extinction strongly affects the short - wavelength morphology of the source .",
    "uv emission may only escape from `` extinction holes '' in the extremely dusty environment of j02399 , a scenario also suggested by @xcite in their study of the dusty high - redshift scuba source smmj14011 + 0252 ( hereafter j14011 ) .",

    "taking into account the different spatial resolutions , the distributions and centroids of the velocity - integrated co(32 ) and @xmath0 continuum emission are coincident , and the peak co emission ( like the peak continuum ) originates in the eastern ( blue - shifted ) emission peak .",

    "our new data agree with and significantly improve on the earlier @xmath61 interferometry of @xcite .",
    "the molecular line emission of j02399 is very broad and has a symmetric `` double - horn '' profile which is characteristic of rotation .",
    "line emission extends over more than @xmath62 ( fwhm ) , and the global profile shows emission peaks at @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( relative to the assumed @xmath22 ) .",
    "an improved co systemic redshift for the source would thus be @xmath65 .",
    "channel maps show that blue and red - shifted emission maxima originate @xmath66 on either side of the phase center , again consistent with rotation .",
    "the largest velocity gradient is along a position angle @xmath67 , i.e. , close to the direction of the elongation of the continuum emission .",
    "in addition to this regular behavior , there also appears to be highly blueshifted emission ( in the @xmath68 channel ) northwest of the center .",
    "we interpret the line profiles and channel maps as showing rapid rotation about a position very near the phase center . taken together , the line and continuum data indicate that the most likely morphology of the source is a disk of molecular gas and dust rotating about a central agn located at the position of the hard x - ray peak .",
    "the absolute astrometry renders unlikely but does not exclude an alternative configuration of two galaxies orbiting each other , in which the agn coincides with either the red or the blue - shifted co(32 ) emission peak .",
    "in what follows , we assume that the molecular gas in j02399 is indeed distributed in a rotating disk . we have constructed ring / disk models with flat rotation curves to fit the continuum and line profile data , including the effects of beam smearing and nonzero velocity dispersions . the data are well fit ( figures [ f - line ] and [ f - disk ] ) by a disk model with a ( radially constant ) rotation velocity of @xmath69 for an assumed inclination of @xmath70 .",
    "the broad wings of the integrated line profile indicate that large local random motions ( turbulence ) are present in the disk .",
    "the fit requires a ratio of local velocity dispersion to rotation velocity of @xmath71 , which is @xmath72 times larger than in the milky way disk but comparable to that seen in local ulirg mergers @xcite . a ring - like distribution with a maximum gas density at @xmath73 on the sky ( @xmath74 in the source plane ) and @xmath75 provides a better match to the flux ratio of @xmath76 between the `` horns '' and the central dip in the global spectrum than a filled , centrally - peaked disk .",
    "@xcite have found that similar rings on somewhat smaller scales are characteristic of the molecular gas distributions in local ulirgs .",
    "the outer disk radius required by our model is @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , in good agreement with our direct fit to the @xmath0 continuum source size .",
    "the enclosed dynamical mass inferred from this disk model is @xmath79 here @xmath80 is a dimensionless scale factor which depends on the disk / spheroid structure , and which for a thin disk in a massive spheroid is close to unity @xcite . within the @xmath81 outer radius of the molecular emission ,",
    "the dynamical mass is @xmath82 .",
    "if a merger model is used instead of a rotating disk , the enclosed mass is approximately a factor of two larger .",
    "the integrated co(32 ) flux from j02399 is @xmath83 ( @xmath84 for a 10% uncertainty in the flux scale ) , in excellent agreement with the value of @xmath85 found by @xcite . with this integrated flux and the assumption of moderately dense ( @xmath86 ) , thermalized gas at temperature @xmath87 ( see e.g. , combes , maoli , & omont 1999 ) , the molecular ( plus helium ) gas mass can be estimated following @xcite : @xmath88 here @xmath33 is the conversion factor from co luminosity to gas mass , which we assume to be @xmath89 , as estimated for local ulirgs @xcite .",
    "the inferred molecular gas mass in j02399 is thus @xmath90 , implying a gas mass fraction of roughly 1030% within @xmath91 which is similar to those observed in local ulirgs @xcite .",

    "the more easily available observations of the ionized gas kinematics are more prone to systematic bias and influences other than gravity @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a massive object at a redshift as high as @xmath104 is qualitatively surprising , given that cdm models make the general prediction that galaxy masses build up gradually as a function of time and redshift , such that the comoving density of massive objects at @xmath105 to 3 is only a small fraction of their local density ( e.g. , kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; baugh et al .",

    "although no clear rotation pattern has as yet been detected and no inclination correction can be made on the basis of the available co line and millimeter continuum maps @xcite , the inclination must be less than @xmath111 for the dynamical mass to be @xmath112 ( i.e. , at least twice the gas mass ) .",

    "their further suggestion that j14011 undergoes an additional factor of ten magnification by a previously unrecognized foreground galaxy ( and that @xmath119 is therefore a factor of ten lower ) rests on the assumption that the filling factor of co emission within the @xmath120-radius structure is unity .",
    "of the seven background scls sources with intrinsic @xmath121 ( before lensing magnification ) , then , the two with known redshifts @xmath122 both have likely baryonic masses in the @xmath123 bin .",
    "these source parameters are not atypical at high redshift : in a growing number of high-@xmath103 qsos and radio galaxies , millimeter co interferometry reveals comparably large molecular gas masses ( in several cases already @xmath124 ) and a variety of linewidths ( guilloteau et al . 1999 ; papadopoulos et al . 2000 ; cox et al .",

    "although the latter step is the most uncertain , evidence from the weakness of radio and optical / uv counterparts for submillimeter sources suggests that these additional four sources are more likely to lie at high than at low redshifts @xcite .",
    "regardless of whether we assign one , two , or six scls sources to the @xmath133 baryonic mass bin , however , we must adjust @xmath131 to reflect the fact that not all massive objects will be detectable by scuba as @xmath134 sources at all times . for a miller - scalo ( 1979 )",

    "the data presented here indicate that this picture may have to be revised with respect to the rate at which massive systems ( and bulges ) are assembled at fairly high redshift , possibly through adjustment of @xmath196 and its coupling to very efficient star formation in major mergers .",
    "more work is needed before a firmer statement can be made about this crucial , `` baryonic mass assembly '' test of the current standard cosmogony . both observational and theoretical",
    "estimates are still very uncertain , with the former depending on small samples and large lifetime corrections , and the latter on ad hoc input recipes for star formation and feedback .",
