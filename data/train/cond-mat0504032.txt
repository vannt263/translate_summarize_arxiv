    "the mathematical analysis of the low temperature mean field spin glass phase has seen enormous progresses in the last few years , after more than twenty years since the proposal of the parisi ansatz @xcite , that led to its physical understanding @xcite .",
    "the first important progress was achieved by guerra and toninelli @xcite , who , through an interpolation among systems of different size provided a temperature independent proof of the existence of the thermodynamic limit for the free - energy and other thermodynamic quantities in a wide class of mean field spin glass systems .",
    "the power of the interpolating method was fully appreciated by guerra @xcite , who comparing interacting mean field systems with suitable paramagnets , was able to write the free - energy as a sum of the parisi expression plus a remainder term , which is manifestly positive in the sk model as well as in @xmath0-spin models for even @xmath0 .",
    "the method was subsequently generalized to deal with diluted spin glass models @xcite and more recently to analyze the kac limit of finite dimensional spin glasses @xcite .    the last , but definitely not the least , step towards the proof of the parisi free energy solution has been performed by talagrand who , through a highly non trivial generalization of interpolation techniques to coupled replica systems , could finally prove the vanishing of the remainder in the guerra formula @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the elegance of the talagrand approach is somewhat obscured by the mathematical necessity of dealing with many technical details in the course of the proof .    in this note",
    "we would like to present the talagrand theorem using a physicist s approach , emphasizing the main ideas and connecting it with the theory of the glassy effective potentials discussed in the physical literature @xcite .",
    "we discuss the case of the spherical @xmath0-spin model , where the saddle point equations take a particularly simple form and where it is well known that the best parisi solution is of the simple `` one step replica symmetry breaking kind '' ( 1rsb ) .",
    "this allows to reduce the technically difficult part of the proof to the explicit solution of variational equations that we analyze numerically .",
    "our paper comprises six sections . in the second section",
    "we define the model and we set the basic definitions that we use in the rest of the paper . in the third section",
    "we illustrate the backbone of the talagrand theorem , specializing it to our simple case . in the fourth section",
    "we derive the replica expressions and evaluate numerically suitable `` effective potential functions '' whose positivity implies the validity of the parisi ansatz .",
    "we conclude the argument in section [ lowerbound ] , where we show that the replica expressions for the potentials provide a lower bound for their exact values .",
    "we finally draw our conclusions .",
    "in the spirit of discussing the results in the simplest non trivial example , we focus on the case of the spherical @xmath0-spin model .    the model considers @xmath1 real spin variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 , subject to a global spherical constraint @xmath4 , and interacting through a @xmath0-body hamiltonian : @xmath5= -   \\sum_{i_1<i_2 < \\cdots i_p}^{1,n}\\ , j_{i_1 \\cdots i_p } \\sigma_{i_1 } \\cdots \\sigma_{i_p } \\;.\\ ] ] the couplings @xmath6 are i.i.d .",

    "this gives : @xmath24 formula ( [ ft ] ) makes a contact between the interpolating method and the cavity method .",
    "in fact it is well known that ( [ ft ] ) can also be written in the form @xcite ( and for a recent review see also @xcite ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 are random weights derived from `` free - energies '' @xmath27 that realize a poisson point process with exponential density @xmath28 $ ] follows a poissonian distribution with average @xmath29 and that the number of levels in disjont intervals are independent . ] , and the @xmath30 are drawn independently for each @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the gaussian distributions defined by ( [ dh ] ) .",

    "the free - energy @xmath22 is independent of @xmath59 and @xmath20 .",
    "the minimization of the remainder @xmath60 is therefore equivalent to the maximization of the 1rsb free - energy .",

    "the talagrand s analysis of the remainder can be divided in three logical steps :    1 .   from the taylor formula one",

    "2 .   in order to get estimates of the averages @xmath64 and @xmath65 , one considers the @xmath10-dependent probabilities @xmath66 for @xmath67 , that the overlap takes a value @xmath68 , respectively in the ensembles defined by @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the main part of the theorem consists in proving that , given @xmath71 , for each @xmath72 , a @xmath10-dependent positive constant @xmath73 exists such that , if @xmath74 and @xmath75 , then it exists a positive constant @xmath76 such that @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath79 indicates the t - dependent free energy calculated with the parisi ansatz .",
    "we will explicitely see in section [ numerical ] that the constant @xmath76 turns out to be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath10 , behaving as @xmath80 for @xmath10 close to @xmath81 .",
    "3 .   the estimates in the previous point imply , in the large @xmath1 limit and fixing any @xmath82 , the existence of a positive @xmath83-dependent constant @xmath84 for which we can write the differential inequality : @xmath85[diffineq ] valid for every @xmath86 . since @xmath87 , ( [ diffineq ] ) proves @xmath88 for every @xmath89 , which by continuity can be extended to @xmath58 .",
    "while the first and third points can be easily understood , the proof of the second point requires several additional steps .      to estimate the probabilities",

    "though our paper does not really contain new mathematical results , we hope that it could be useful to spread the talagrand s results in a larger community .",
    "one of the difficulties of the talagrand paper is that the proof was provided in a general parisi scheme with arbitrary steps of rsb .",
    "this is needed in the case of the sk model or in the low temperature phase of the ising @xmath0-spin model . there , the derivation is complicated by the need to go to the limit of continuous replica symmetry breaking . in particular",
    ", talagrand showed that , for every @xmath72 , it is possible to consider a number @xmath229 of steps of rsb such that an interpolating system with @xmath230 steps is solved by the parisi ansatz with @xmath231 steps .",
    "one then has to show the positivity of @xmath231 different potential functions .",
    "an alternative is to work directly in the continuous rsb limit , and to look for a lower bound for a suitable family of potential functions depending on a continuous index .",
    "these potentials can be computed explicitly in spherical models with full rsb @xcite , and we hope to report soon on that case .    thanks to the more physical approach followed in this revisitation of the talagrand proof , it can also be easier to analyze more involved mean field systems , like those diluted , where a lower bound for the free energy was recently found @xcite by an extension of the interpolating procedure .",
    "generalizing the procedure used to define the averages ( [ averages ] ) , the first step to define @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 is to consider three four - replica hamiltonian with the general form : @xmath235 + \\sqrt{u t } h_p[\\tau]-\\sqrt{1-t } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left ( ( h_i + h^1_{d , i } ) \\sigma_i   + ( h_i   + h^2_{d , i } )    \\tau_i\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\sqrt{(1-u ) t } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left (   ( g^1_{1,i } + g^1_{2,i } + g^1_{d , i } ) \\sigma_i + ( g^2_{i,1 } + g^2_{i,2 } + g^2_{d , i } ) \\tau_i   \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sqrt{u t } h_p[\\sigma ' ] + \\sqrt{u t } h_p[\\tau']-\\sqrt{1-t } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left ( ( \\tilde{h}_i + \\tilde{h}^1_{d , i } ) \\sigma'_i   + ( \\tilde{h}_i   + \\tilde{h}^2_{d , i } )    \\tau'_i\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\sqrt{(1-u ) t } \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left (   ( \\tilde{g}^1_{1,i } + \\tilde{g}^1_{2,i } + \\tilde{g}^1_{d , i } ) \\sigma'_i + ( \\tilde{g}^2_{i,1 } + \\tilde{g}^2_{i,2 } + \\tilde{g}^2_{d , i } ) \\tau'_i   \\right ) \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the new introduced fields have the same distribution of the corresponding @xmath128 and @xmath217 fields : @xmath236 have the same distribution of @xmath128 , and @xmath237 the same distribution of @xmath217 .      1",
