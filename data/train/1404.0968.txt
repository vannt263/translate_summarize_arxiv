    "point ( zero - range ) interactions have attracted great interest in quantum mechanics @xcite . they provide important solvable models with a wide variety of applications in atomic physics , such as the lieb - liniger @xcite model for a one dimensional gas of bosons interacting by means of a @xmath1-function potential ( for other applications see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , point interactions have proven to be a fruitful _ theoretical laboratory _ to investigate methods of quantum field theory ( qft ) , such as regularization and renormalization , in simpler and more manageable models in one and two - dimensional quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the simplest point interaction in one dimensional non - relativistic quantum mechanics is given by the dirac s @xmath1-function potential , which is well defined and has well - known solutions .",
    "however , attempts to consider more general interactions , such as that associated with a @xmath2 potential ( the prime indicates a spatial derivative ) , have been known to be plagued with difficulties associated with the definition of the interaction @xcite ( also see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "mathematically rigorous methods were employed to define such interactions by obtaining self - adjoint extensions ( sae ) of the kinetic energy operator for schrdinger s theory .",
    "it was shown that a four - parameter family of interactions , defined by their boundary conditions , exhaust all the possibilities for point interactions in non - relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite ( for a review of the mathematical literature on this subject see @xcite ) .",
    "given the somewhat abstract and mathematically involved nature of sae , another approach was developed for this subject , consisting in the investigation of regularizations using sequences of regular short - range potentials which converge to point potentials in the zero - range limit @xcite .",
    "even if this method is more intuitive and appealing from a physicist s point of view , such an approach has often led to ambiguous and even contradictory results  which , in general , arise from the dependence of the particular regularizing scheme employed ( see , for instance , @xcite and references there cited ) .    in relativistic quantum mechanics , for a dirac particle , even the @xmath1-function potential ( which is the most singular interaction allowed in the dirac s equation )",
    "is problematic and it is known to lead to ambiguities @xcite . similarly to the non - relativistic case , the sae approach implies that the most general point interactions in dirac s theory are also given by a four - parameter family of interactions @xcite .",
    "the most commonly studied particular cases of relativistic point interactions correspond to pure electrostatic and pure scalar potentials , which have also been investigated by regularization through @xmath1-converging sequences of functions , with results that are , in general , dependent on the regularizing function used @xcite .",
    "the situation described above is not entirely new : analogous difficulties involving regularization ambiguities arise in quantum field theory ( qft ) and have been successfully addressed by using the epstein - glaser approach to qft , in which distribution theory is employed from the beginning and the symmetries of the system are carefully implemented ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in a similar vein , in this paper we will introduce a distributional approach to point interactions in quantum mechanics ",
    "first announced in a preliminary version in @xcite .",
    "the method proposed here starts from the realization that both the singular potential and the wave function in the schrdinger or dirac equations _ must _ be considered as distributions .",
    "this precludes the naive definition of the interaction term in these equations as the usual product between the wave function and the potential energy , since such a product is generally ill - defined in distribution theory @xcite .",
    "we will introduce a well defined distribution to play the role of the interaction term , the properties of which must follow from simple mathematical requirements concerning its support and singular order ( a concept introduced in the next section ) , besides the physical requirement of conservation of the probability current across the singular point . as a consequence , a four - parameter family of distributions will naturally emerge as the most general point interaction in both non - relativistic and relativistic one - dimensional quantum mechanics , a result which is in complete agreement with those obtained with the sae approach @xcite .",
    "however , there is an important conceptual difference between the sae and the distributional approaches , for while the first characterizes all the possible point interactions only through the boundary conditions that the wave function must satisfy around the singular point , the latter explicitly gives the interaction term as a distribution concentrated at that point ",
    "thus , in the distributional approach the boundary conditions emerge as a _ consequence _ of the properties of the particular interaction distribution substituted into the schrdinger or dirac equations .",
    "thus , the distributional approach provides an alternative ( also mathematically rigorous ) to the method of sae , with the advantage of being less abstract ( to a physicist ) and allowing a more intuitive physical interpretation of the interaction term , which here is presented explicitly as a distribution .",
    "in addition , the distributional approach can contribute to clarify some ambiguities which arise from the use of regularizations to treat zero - range potentials  in particular , the explicit form of the interaction distribution allow us to address , in a straightforward way , the much debated question about the existence or not of a  true \" ( i.e. , _ odd _ under parity ) point interaction associated with a @xmath3 potential . notice that a proper definition of the notion of an odd point interaction is a non - trivial task in the context of the sae approach .",
    "it is worth to notice that in this work we are concerned only to the well - established schwartz s theory of distributions , which considers only distributions defined on spaces of infinitely differentiable test functions .",
    "an approach based on an alternative theory of distributions defined on spaces of discontinuous test functions was also proposed by kurasov in @xcite , who assumes the wave function to be a member of a space of test functions and claims that point interactions can not be properly defined in the framework of the standard distribution theory . in the approach",
    "proposed here such a difficulty does not arise because the wave function itself must be consistently treated as a distribution , not as a test function .",
    "this is analogous to what occurs in the epstein - glaser distributional approach to quantum field theory , in which quantities defined in terms of quantum fields must be treated themselves as ( operator - valued ) distributions @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ nr ]",
    "we introduce the distributional approach by considering the schrdinger equation with a singular potential of order @xmath4 , the most singular point interaction allowed in non - relativistic one - dimensional quantum mechanics . in section [ r ]",
    "we extend our methods to consider dirac s equation with a singular interaction of order @xmath5 .",
    "section [ concl ] is reserved for our concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we introduce the distributional approach to point interactions in one dimensional quantum mechanics .",
    "we consider distributions defined on the schwartz space of rapid descent test functions  for a comprehensive treatment of distributions see @xcite , which we follow closely ( also see @xcite ) .    for a non - relativistic particle moving under the influence of a potential energy @xmath6 which is assumed to be a locally integrable function ( i.e. , a function integrable in the lebesgue sense over every finite interval ) ,",
    "the one - dimensional time - independent schrdinger equation can be written as ( in this section we will adopt units such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) @xmath9 then , by assuming that the wave function @xmath10 is continuous everywhere , the _ interaction term _ , @xmath11 , is well - defined and corresponds to a locally integrable ordinary function .",
    "on the other hand , potentials which do not correspond to locally integrable functions are called _ singular _ , as it is the case of the dirac @xmath1-function \" or its derivatives , and only make sense as distributions .",
    "distributions corresponding to locally integrable functions are said to be _",
    "regular_. as a consequence , in the case of singular potentials the schrdinger equation is in general mathematically ill - defined , since the wave function itself must be considered as a distribution and the product appearing on the r. h. s. of ( [ sch ] ) is not a well defined operation for two arbitrary distributions @xcite .",

    "then , in any interval which does not include the singularities the potential is regular ( and the wave function @xmath10 continuous ) , and therefore the interaction distribution , @xmath15(x)$ ] , coincides with the ordinary product of functions @xmath16 in such an interval .    in order to determine the interaction distribution @xmath15(x)$ ]",
    "let us define the _ singular order _ ( or simply the _ order _ ) of a distribution , a concept that characterizes the  strength \" of the singularity and plays a crucial role in this approach .",
    "the definition of singular order of a distribution adopted in this work is the extended concept of order considered by zemanian ( see @xcite , p. 162",
    "- 163 ) , which can be written as follows .",
    "a distribution @xmath17 is said to have singular order @xmath18 on a closed finite interval @xmath19 if @xmath20 in this interval , where @xmath21 is a distribution corresponding to a continuous but not differentiable function on @xmath19 and @xmath22 is the @xmath23-th distributional derivative of @xmath21 ( a  derivative of negative order \" means an indefinite integration , as usual ) .",
    "an infinitely smooth function is said to have order @xmath24 . if a distribution has a finite order the operations of differentiation and indefinite integration change its order by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "it follows that distributions having @xmath27 are regular , whereas distributions having @xmath28 are singular . when @xmath29 the distribution can be regular or singular , depending on the case . as some important examples ,",
    "the heaviside @xmath30 distribution has singular order @xmath26 ( and it is a regular distribution ) , while its primitives have @xmath31 , and correspond to continuous but not differentiable functions .",
    "the dirac s delta @xmath32 and its first derivative @xmath3 are singular distributions with singular orders @xmath33 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "let us now return to the task of determining the interaction distribution @xmath15(x)$ ] .",
    "we require that :    * @xmath34 ; * the singular order of the distribution @xmath35(x)$ ] can not exceed the singular order of @xmath6 in any closed subset of its support ;    where @xmath36 indicates the _ support _ of the distribution @xmath37 , which is the smallest closed set outside of which @xmath37 equals zero @xcite .",
    "both these requirements are automatically satisfied when @xmath6 corresponds to a regular distribution  here we are just extending them in a natural way to the case of potentials described by singular distributions . in particular",
    ", requirement @xmath38 prevents the introduction of interaction terms even more singular than the original potential ( this is analogous to the _ minimal distribution splitting _ condition introduced in the epstein - glaser approach to qft @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we are interested only in singular _ point interactions _ ,",
    "i.e. , interactions which vanish everywhere except at a single point , which is assumed to be the origin @xmath39 , where they are singular .",
    "thus , from the requirement @xmath40 above , it follows that @xmath41=\\{0\\}$ ] .",

    "the specification of the singular order @xmath49 and of all the coefficients @xmath45 ( @xmath52 ) in ( [ clinterm ] ) uniquely determines the interaction .",
    "however , in order to determine such quantities we must impose on the system some fundamental physical requirements and , since we are considering a _ stationary system _ , it is natural to require that    * the probability current must be conserved everywhere  in particular , it must be conserved across the singular point ;    there is , of course , nothing new about this requirement in itself  however , when considered together with @xmath40 and @xmath38 it drastically reduces the number of free parameters in a point interaction , as shown below .",

    "we observe that @xmath53 is the maximum singular order allowed in order to have normalizable wave functions ( i.e. square integrable ordinary functions )  if @xmath55 were allowed the stationary wave function would have singular order greater than or equal to zero , and it would necessarily be a singular distribution .",

    "this potential , when naively substituted in schrdinger s equation ( [ sch ] ) , is well - known to lead to contradictions ",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "in this section we generalize the approach introduced in the previous section to find the most general family of point interactions allowed in one - dimensional relativistic quantum mechanics , in the context of dirac s equation .",
    "let us first recall that , in one dimension , the time - independent dirac equation for a particle of mass @xmath48 interacting with a _ regular _",

    "this interaction is an equal mix of electrostatic and scalar potentials , which is known to be a confining interaction @xcite ( i.e. , the transmission amplitude approaches zero in the limit @xmath258 ) . on the other hand , the relativistic interaction given by @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 , @xmath256(x ) = \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma ( { \\bf 1}-\\beta)\\psi ( 0 ^ - ) \\delta ( x),\\ ] ] is the inverted mix of electrostatic and scalar potentials ( also confining @xcite ) and corresponds , in the non - relativistic limit , to the interaction given by @xmath263 , @xmath178 and @xmath264 , which is the so - called @xmath265-interaction ( with strength @xmath266 ) .",
    "other well - known one - parameter subfamilies of relativistic interactions are the pure scalar ( @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath254 ) and pure electrostatic ( @xmath267 , @xmath269 , @xmath254 ) , which do not correspond in the non - relativistic limit either to a @xmath1 or to the @xmath2 interaction , as already observed by benvegn and dabrowski @xcite .",
    "these are , of course ,",
    "just some examples of particular one - parameter subfamilies often studied in the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics in one dimension ; all of them are included in the four - parameter family of interactions considered above .",
    "finally , the results of subsection [ symm ] , concerning the characterization of non - relativistic point interactions with respect to their behavior under space reversal ( parity transformations ) , can be straightforwardly extended to relativistic interactions .",
    "accordingly , if @xmath167 solves a dirac equation with the interaction @xmath210(x)$ ] , the interaction is said to be _ even _ under space reversal if @xmath270 solves the same equation , and it is said to be _ odd _ if @xmath271 solves the dirac equation for an interaction term with _ reversed _ sign , @xmath272(x)$ ] .",
    "the conditions that the relativistic parameters must satisfy to characterize an even interaction are @xmath267 , @xmath273 for the non separated solutions , and @xmath274 or @xmath275 for the separated solutions .",
    "these are exactly the conditions that we would obtain from the correspondence relationships between the non - relativistic and relativistic parameters , eqs .",
    "( [ rnrr ] ) and ( [ rnrrsep ] ) . in a similar way",
    ", we conclude that there is no point interaction which is odd under space reversal in one dimensional relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "in this work we considered a distributional approach to treat singular point potentials in one - dimensional quantum mechanics .",
    "the method relies on the fact that any singular distribution concentrated at a point must be a linear combination of the @xmath1-distribution and its derivatives ( see theorem 1 ) .",
    "this , together with requirement @xmath38 ( section [ nr ] ) , allows us to substitute the ill - defined product @xmath11 in the schrdinger and dirac equations by a well - defined interaction distribution with a given singular order .",
    "then , the interaction distribution is completely determined by imposing the physical requirement that the probability current is conserved across the singularity ",
    "notice that even though the probability current is , in general , ill - defined _ at _ the singularity , it is well - defined on both sides of the singularity , so that in all the steps we only deal with well defined distributions .",
    "implicit in the method is a _ locality condition _ , i.e. , the interaction term depends both on singular potential and the wave function at the vicinities of the singular point .",
    "the application of the distributional approach to both non - relativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics leads to a four - parameter family of point interactions , a result in agreement with that obtained by the method of self - adjoint extensions .",
    "it is important to notice that , while our results coincide with those of sae in what regards the characterization of the family of all point interactions for schrdinger s and dirac s theories , there is an important conceptual difference between the two methods . while in sae",
    "the interaction is defined only in terms of the boundary conditions around the singular point , in the present distributional approach the interaction is _ explicitly constructed _ from simple mathematical and physical requirements as an _ interaction distribution _ concentrated at the origin , which implies the boundary conditions satisfied by the wave function .",
    "the fact that the interaction term is explicitly provided [ following from the requirements @xmath40-@xmath54 in section [ nr ] ] makes it particularly simple to analyze the symmetries of the interaction , as the investigation of parity transformations in sections [ nr ] and [ r ] shows .",
    "as one of the main results of the distributional approach such an analysis shows , in a simple way , why there is no _ odd _ point interaction in one dimension .",
    "indeed , an immediate general consequence of the distributional method is that any regularization using @xmath2-converging sequences of functions for the potential must converge , _ in the sense of distributions _ , to an interaction distribution _ which can not be odd _ under parity .",
    "we conjecture that a failure to satisfy this criterion is at the origin of the sometimes contradictory results appearing in the literature of regularization based treatments of zero - range interactions .",
    "notice that , in general , these regularization methods assume from the start odd sequences of short - range potentials with the expectation of obtaining an  odd @xmath2-interaction \" in the zero - range limit ( even though , of course , this is no guarantee of convergence to an odd distribution , as clearly demonstrated by eba @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that the distributional approach to point interactions developed here offers a mathematically rigorous and less abstract alternative to the ( also rigorous ) sae method .",
    "in addition , the method is expected to generalize in a straightforward way to higher dimensions as well as to more general interactions in one or more dimensions which still present open questions , such as the coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "preliminary work applying the distributional approach to the one - dimensional coulomb interaction @xcite suggests that the fact that one obtains an explicit form for the interaction distribution , together with symmetry considerations , may help to clarify some ambiguities concerning a proper characterization of this interaction .",

    "<S> we consider the one - dimensional quantum mechanical problem of defining interactions concentrated at a single point in the framework of the theory of distributions . the often ill - defined product which describes the interaction term in the schrdinger and dirac equations is replaced by a well - defined distribution satisfying some simple mathematical conditions and , in addition , the physical requirement of probability current conservation </S>",
    "<S> is imposed . </S>",
    "<S> a four - parameter family of interactions thus emerges as the most general point interaction both in the non - relativistic and in the relativistic theories ( in agreement with results obtained by self - adjoint extensions ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the interaction is given explicitly , the distributional method allows one to carry out symmetry investigations in a simple way , and it proves to be useful to clarify some ambiguities related to the so - called @xmath0 interaction . </S>"
