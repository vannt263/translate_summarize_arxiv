    "study of the nuclear bulge  ( nb ) is extremely difficult as it is one of the most highly obscured regions of the galaxy .",
    "the extinction towards the nb is so great that it is almost impossible to observe at visual wavelengths .",
    "it is necessary to observe in the near - infrared  ( nir ) to obtain imaging similar to that normally obtained in visual .",
    "previous measures of the nir extinction towards the nb @xcite found the extinction to be highly spatially variable .",
    "we present a new mapping of the extinction towards the nb at a much higher resolution than previously possible .",
    "we mapped the extinction across a region of approximately @xmath5 centred on sgr a * using near - infrared data from the ( united kingdom infrared deep sky survey - galactic plane survey ) ukidss - gps @xcite .",
    "using a 2:1 over - sampling , we obtained a resolution of 5  over the entire region , an order of magnitude better than previous maps . at each position on the map we use the median colour - indices of the stars within a 10  box to calculate the local extinction law parameter @xmath4 using the equation :    @xmath6    until recently , this extinction law parameter which indicates the relationship between extinction and wavelength as @xmath7",
    "was thought to be a constant @xmath8 @xcite for the nb .",
    "we show that it is in fact highly variable in the nb . using a local extinction law calculation",
    ", we then measure the absolute extinction in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3-bands using the equations :    @xmath9    our final calculation of absolute extinction takes into account the variation in the extinction law as well as variation in the amount of absolute extinction at each location . using data from the 3 bands , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , we are able to calculate three measures of the extinction law and two measures of the absolute extinction for each band at each position in our map",
    ". full details of this method will be presented in gosling et al .",
    "figure [ f : graphs ] shows histograms of the value of the extinction law parameter @xmath4 and the values of absolute extinction measured from the three colour - indices ratios .",

    "we suggest that a specific extinction law calculation be undertaken for all observations in the nb if possible , however , when this is not possible , we recommend a value of @xmath10 be used . in such cases the possible variation from this mean of @xmath4 should be considered as it can have a large effect on the relative values of absolute extinction calculated",
    ".    using the specific , local extinction law , we calculated the value of absolute extinction in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3-bands from all three colour indices ratios .",
    "we measured the extinction in magnitudes to be @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "all three distributions have high extinction tails extending to higher values of absolute extinction than these ranges .",
    "figure [ f : extmap ] shows the resultant extinction map as well as a false colour nir and mid - infrared image of the same region for comparison .",
    "we repeated the extinction calculation described above using a single extinction law .",
    "we used a @xmath14-test comparison between the extinction calculated for different bands to show that the calculation using the variable extinction law produced statistically consistent extinction in all three bands ( differences within 3@xmath15 of the overall distribution ) , whereas using a single extinction value produced statistically inconsistent extinction between bands ( differences of 10 - 50@xmath15 of the overall distribution ) .",

    "we have presented a new , highly detailed map of the nir extinction towards the nb using data from the ukidss - gps .",
    "we find both variation in the degree of absolute extinction , and in the extinction law parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we show that the extinction law is not `` universal '' as had previously been thought @xcite , but is highly variable , and that only when this variation is taken into account can absolute extinction be calculated consistently at different wavelengths .",
    "we recommend that this variable extinction law be taken into account in all future extinction corrections .",
    "we intend to compare our extinction law and absolute extinction maps to dust emission observed with _ spitzer _ ( _ top - right _ insert in figure [ f : extmap ] ) to better determine the properties of the extincting material and so the distribution of gas and dust in the bulge ."
