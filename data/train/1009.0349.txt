    "the zeeman interactions of electron spins with magnetic field is known to be one of the mechanisms destroying the singlet superconducting order ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "according to this mechanism a homogeneous superconducting state becomes energetically unfavorable above the pauli limiting field @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the gap value and @xmath2 is the bohr magneton .",
    "however , superconductivity can appear even at the fields exceeding the @xmath3 field provided we consider inhomogeneous states with a spatially modulated cooper pair wave function @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the cooper pairs consist of electrons with different spin projections and different absolute values of momentum .",
    "there are at least two difficulties in experimental observation of the fflo instability : ( i ) first , the strong orbital effect which destroys cooper pairs above the upper critical field @xmath4 which appears to be much less than @xmath3 in most superconducting compounds ; ( ii ) second , the impurity scattering which is known to prevent the fflo state formation .",
    "thus , to observe this interesting physical phenomenon we need to find rather clean superconducting materials with very short coherence lengths to increase the critical field corresponding to the orbital effect .",
    "alternatively , we should consider strongly anisotropic quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems or very thin films in a magnetic field parallel to the superconducting planes . among the compounds which are usually included in the list of strong candidates for the fflo states observation one should mention layered organic superconductors @xcite and heavy fermion systems like @xmath5 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    during the last decade the attention of both theoreticians and experimentalists have been attracted to a new type of superfluid systems which are considered as promising playground for the study of this intriguing phenomenon , i.e. , ultracold fermi gases in magneto - optical traps @xcite .",
    "the fflo type instability in these systems is caused not by the zeeman interaction but by the tuning of the population imbalance between two lowest hyperfine states of @xmath6 atoms .",
    "experimentally this population imbalance is governed by the radio frequency signal inducing transitions between the hyperfine states .",
    "thus , changing the population imbalance we should get the inhomogeneous fflo state with a certain intrinsic length scale and this phenomenon is not masked by any kind of the orbital effect .",
    "the orbital effect in such neutral atomic condensates is associated not with magnetic field but with system rotation which is known to be an important part of the experimental procedure of detection of superfluidity in the ultracold gases @xcite .",
    "the fflo states in an ultracold gas cloud should be , of course , modified by the effect of the trapping potential confining the atomic system . as a result",
    ", the physics of this phenomenon will be determined by the interplay of three length scales : ( i ) length scale of the fflo instability ; ( ii ) atomic system size ; ( iii ) the length scale associated with the condensate rotation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the atomic mass and @xmath9 is the angular velocity .",
    "an analogous interplay appears in a thin mesoscopic superconducting disc with fflo instability caused by the strong magnetic field parallel to the disc plane .",
    "the effect of rotation in this case and corresponding length @xmath10 should be replaced by the magnetic field component @xmath11 perpendicular to the disc plane and magnetic length @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study this interplay in both superconducting and superfluid finite  size systems with fflo instability and describe the hallmarks of the fflo phenomenon in a restricted geometry .    in standard superconductors without fflo instability the finite system size",
    "is known to cause the so called little ",
    "parks effect , i.e. the oscillatory behavior of the phase transition line on the plane magnetic field ",
    "temperature @xcite .",
    "these quantum oscillations originate from the switching between the superconducting states with different vorticities or winding numbers .",
    "the quantum oscillations of the critical temperature vs magnetic field ( or angular velocity ) are known to reveal themselves also in infinite 2d fflo superconductors and superfluids @xcite .",
    "our theoretical work aims to the identification of both the similarities and distinctive features of the quantum oscillations in mesoscopic systems with and without fflo instability .",
    "we focus here on the case of 2d systems when the quantum oscillatory effects appear to be most pronounced . in section",
    "ii we discuss a modified ginzburg  landau model which takes account of both the fflo phenomenon and confinement effect .",
    "in section iii we consider the case of a mesoscopic disc while the section iv is devoted to the rotating fermi condensates confined in traps .",
    "we summarize our results in section v.",
    "hereafter our consideration of the fflo phase formation will be based on modified ginzburg  landay ( gl ) theory where the appearance of the nonuniform state is caused by a change in the sign of the second - order gradient term in the free energy expansion .",
    "an appropriate gl functional can be derived from the microscopic theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . calculating the superfluid critical temperature",
    "one can take the gl free energy density in the form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the superfluid order parameter , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the critical temperature of the second  order transition into a uniform superconducting or superfluid state , and @xmath17 is the gauge  invariant two dimensional momentum operator .",
    "note that here we omit the terms of the higher order in @xmath14 which come into play only below the superfluid transition . in the fflo region",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 and minimum of the free energy functional does not correspond to uniform state , since a spatial variation of the order parameter decreases of the energy of the system .",
    "certainly , the gl functional provides an adequate description of a long - wavelength fflo modulation only near the lifshitz tricritical point , however the results of the gl approach can be extrapolated qualitatively to the whole region of the fflo phase .",
    "a lateral confinement of the condensate can be introduced either using a boundary condition for the order parameter @xmath14 at the sample edge or adding an external potential well @xmath19 to the free energy density ( [ eq:1v ] ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the in - plane radius vector .",
    "varying an appropriate free energy functional ( [ eq:2v ] ) we find : @xmath22 we restrict ourselves to the consideration of cylindrically symmetric systems and , thus , assume the confining potential @xmath23 to depend only on the radius @xmath24 , where ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) are the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the value @xmath27 in the above equation plays the role of the inverse characteristic length scale of the fflo modulation .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a dimensionless coordinate @xmath28 and dimensionless shift of the critical temperature @xmath29 : @xmath30 as a result , one can rewrite the the equation ( [ eq:3v ] ) in a dimensionless form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    in the following sections we proceed with the calculation of the shift of the critical temperature for fflo states with different vorticities or winding numbers .",
    "we consider two generic examples of restricted fflo systems : ( i ) a thin mesoscopic superconducting disk of the radius @xmath34 placed in an external magnetic field tilted with respect to the disc plane ; ( ii ) rotating 2d superfluid fermi condensate confined in a harmonic trap .     for an infinite 2d superconducting film ( a ) and for a 2d disc of a finite radius ( b ) in a parallel magnetic field @xmath35.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0%",
