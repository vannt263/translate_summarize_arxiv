    "the high-@xmath0 cuprates and the colossal magnetoresistive manganites , the two main realms in condensed matter physics , are both doped correlated insulators .",
    "as type ii superconductors accommodate magnetic flux by allowing a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of the superconducting order parameter , such fermionic insulating states do not necessarily remain spatially uniform _ against doping .",
    "_ indeed recent stm experiments have observed that a hole rich region in a doped mott insulator such as bi-2212 forms a nanoscale granular island on top of the insulating background  @xcite . a similar kind of nanoscale electronic inhomogeneity was also found in ca@xmath1na@xmath2cuo@xmath3cl@xmath3 , where doped holes form a checkerboard pattern  @xcite . on the other hand , extensive lorentz optical microscopy measurements on doped ( e.g. , mixed valence ) manganites have revealed that charge ordered and ferromagnetic metallic patches are phase - separated in such relatively large length scales as a few micrometer  @xcite .",
    "the question naturally arises as follows : is there some universal classification of insulators in terms of their different types of behavior against doping ?",
    "the other way around , if it exists , what kind of _ microscopic ingredients _ would determine these differences ?",
    "these experimental questions / observations as well as almost all the other experimental observables are directly accessible through the `` local electronic polarization '' @xmath4 , which acquires finite _ mass _ only in dielectrics .",
    "contrary to other observables , however , the local electronic polarizations can not be uniquely determined by those vector fields which are divergence - free .",
    "namely , using arbitrary _",
    "scalar functions @xmath5 , we can introduce those vector fields which have nothing to do with the local charge density @xmath6 ; @xmath7 due to this arbitrariness , constructing effective theories of dielectrics in such a way that _ the local polarization becomes explicit _ has been one of the long - standing issues in condensed matter theories community , while widely demanded from experimental sides on a general ground .",
    "the central idea of the duality picture is to regard this local electronic polarization as the `` gauge field '' _ which is intrinsic in matters _ and to treat its divergence - free part as the unphysical `` gauge '' degree of freedom .",
    "@xcite to be more specific , we suppose that there exist _ order parameters _ , implicit in a microscopic model , which are coupled with the local electronic polarization such that its condensation makes this `` gauge fields '' massive via the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the `` gauge '' in eq.([polariz ] ) and that of this order parameter @xmath8 are specified _ in a set _ , as in superconductors ; @xmath9 where the vortex - free scalar function @xmath5 should be identical to that in eq .",
    "( [ polariz ] ) .    in this paper , observing this duality picture , we will introduce this complex - valued order parameter @xmath8 explicitly _ in terms of original fermion ( electron )",
    "operators_. then we calculate the expectation value of this order parameter with respect to some simple wavefunctions , so that we can argue that this order parameter has indeed a finite amplitude , i.e. _ condensed _ , only in fermionic insulators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we look further into the duality between superconductivity and insulator only to arrive at the conjecture that the appropriate order parameter for a 2d fermionic insulating state is the _ disorder operator ( dop ) _ defined as eqs .",
    "( [ plane],[torus ] ) .",
    "we then give a general expression to the expectation value of the dop . in sec .",
    "iii , we will see that this expectation value indeed vanishes for band metals having various kinds of fermi surface ( f.s . ) in the thermodynamic limit . in sec .",
    "iv , we will consider the opposite limit , i.e. , the case of a band insulator / gapped mean - field order state close to the atomic limit .",
    "thereby , we observe that the expectation value of the dop is in turn characterized by the localization length and thus remain finite . then these two observations , i.e. those in sec .",
    "iii and in sec .",
    "iv , lead us to extrapolate the behaviour of the dop in general insulating states .",
    "v is devoted to the arguments on the relation between the dop and `` twisting boundary condition '' , the latter known to give a definite criterion for insulating states in arbitrary spatial dimension  @xcite .",
    "vi contains not only the brief summary ( see table .",
    "ii ) but also discussions on the behaviour of our dop in the off - diagonal long ranged ordered states .",
    "we also mentioned there about the possible microscopic candidates of _ the counterpart of the magnetic penetration depth / coherence length _ ( see table .",
    "i ) and the future possible progress .",
    "some details of the calculation are left to the appendix .",
    "let us denote the usual superconducting order parameter as @xmath10 . in this paper , we consider only two spatial dimension ( 2d )",
    ", i.e. @xmath11 . if the magnetic penetration depth @xmath12 is large enough compared with the coherence length @xmath13 ( if @xmath14 in the conventional ginzburg - landau theory  @xcite ) , then the system shows a type ii superconducting behavior , accommodating magnetic flux @xmath15 pinned to _",
    "vortices _ in the system .",
    "the amplitude of order parameter @xmath16 is spatially not uniform and can have zeros .",
    "then its phase @xmath17 acquires an ambiguity of integer multiples of @xmath18 around its zeros .",
    "the holonomy of this phase around such a vortex is proportional to the number of magnetic flux pinned to this vortex , counted in units of the flux quantum @xmath19 .",
    "let a flux penetrate a specific area @xmath20 .",
    "then , we have , _ 0_s ( ) d= _ s b ( )  d^2 r , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the boundary of this area @xmath20 .",
    "we now invoke this relation to identify the _ dual quantity _ of @xmath23 .",
    ".the duality between 2d insulator and superconductivity [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     observing these several circumstantial evidences including the connection with the conventional approach , we believe , in spite of its complexness stemming from its non - locality , that the dop is finite only in an insulator .",
