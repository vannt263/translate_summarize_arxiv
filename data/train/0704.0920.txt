    "the idea of the `` true '' two - proton radioactivity was proposed about 50 years ago in a classical paper of goldansky @xcite .",
    "the word `` true '' denotes here that we are dealing not with a relatively simple emission of two protons , which becomes possible in every nucleus above two - proton decay threshold , but with a specific situation where one - proton emission is energetically ( due to the proton separation energy in the daughter system ) or dynamically ( due to various reasons ) prohibited .",
    "only simultaneous emission of two protons is possible in that case ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : levels ] , more details on the modes of the three - body decays can be found in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics of such decays can not be reduced to a sequence of two - body decays and from theoretical point of view we have to deal with a three - body coulomb problem in the continuum , which is known to be very complicated .",
    "progress in this field was quite slow .",
    "only recently a consistent quantum mechanical theory of the process was developed @xcite , which allows to study the two - proton ( three - body ) decay phenomenon in a three - body cluster model .",
    "it has been applied to a range of a light nuclear systems ( @xmath4o , @xmath5ne @xcite , @xmath6be , @xmath7li@xmath8 , @xmath9be@xmath8 @xcite , @xmath1ne@xmath8 , @xmath10 mg @xcite ) .",

    "experimental studies of the two - proton radioactivity is presently an actively developing field . since the first experimental identification of @xmath11 radioactivity in @xmath2fe @xcite it was also found in @xmath15zn @xcite .",
    "some fingerprints of the @xmath14ni @xmath11 decay were observed and the @xmath2fe lifetime and decay energy were measured with improved accuracy @xcite .",
    "there was an intriguing discovery of the extreme enhancement of the @xmath11 decay mode for the high - spin @xmath19 isomer of @xmath20ag , interpreted so far only in terms of the hyperdeformation of this state @xcite .",
    "new experiments , aimed at more detailed @xmath11 decay studies ( e.g.  observation of correlations ) , are under way at gsi ( @xmath10 mg ) , msu ( @xmath2fe ) , ganil ( @xmath2fe ) , and jyvskyl ( @xmath20ag ) .",
    "several other theoretical approaches were applied to the problem in the recent years .",

    "some issues of a compatibility between different approaches will be addressed in this work .",
    "another , possibly very important , field of application of the two - proton decay studies was shown in refs .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the importance of direct resonant two - proton radiative capture processes was underestimated in earlier treatment of the rp - process waiting points @xcite",
    ". the scale of modification of the astrophysical @xmath11 capture rates can be as large as several orders of magnitude in certain temperature ranges . in paper",
    "@xcite it has been found that nonresonant e1 contributions to three - body ( two - proton ) capture rates can also be much larger than was expected before .",
    "the updated @xmath11 astrophysical capture rate for the @xmath21o(@xmath11,@xmath22)@xmath1ne reaction appears to be competing with the standard @xmath21o(@xmath23,@xmath22)@xmath10ne breakout reaction for the hot cno cycle .",
    "the improvements of the @xmath11 capture rates obtained in @xcite are connected to consistent quantum mechanical treatment of the three - body coulomb continuum in contrast to the essentially quasiclassical approach typically used in astrophysical calculations of three - body capture reactions ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the growing quality of the experimental studies of the @xmath11 decays and the high precision required for certain astrophysical calculations inspired us to revisit the issues connected with different uncertainties and technical difficulties of our studies . in this work",
    "we make the following .",
    "( i ) extend the two - body formalism of the integral formulae for width to the three - body case .",
    "we perform the relevant derivations for the two - body case to make the relevant approximations and assumptions explicit .",
    "( ii ) formulate a simplified three - body model which has many dynamical features similar to the realistic case , but allows the exact semianalytical treatment and thus makes possible a precise calibration of three - body calculations .",
    "it is also possible to study in great detail several important dependencies of three - body widths in the frame of this model .",
    "( iii ) perform practical studies of some systems of interest and demonstrate a connection between the simplified semianalytical formalism and the realistic three - body calculations .",
    "the unit system @xmath24 is used in the article .",
    "integral formalisms of width calculations for narrow two - body states are known for a long time , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the prime objective of those studies was @xmath23-decay widths .",
    "an interesting overview of this field can be found in the book @xcite .",
    "this approach , to our opinion , did not produce novel results as the inherent uncertainties of the method are essentially the same as those of the r - matrix phenomenology , which is technically much simpler ( see e.g.  a discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "an important nontrivial application of the integral formalism was calculation of widths for proton emission off deformed states @xcite .",
    "there were attempts to extend the integral formalism to the three - body decays , using a formal generalization for the hyperspherical space @xcite .",
    "these were shown to be difficult with respect to technical realisation and to be inferior to other methods developed in @xcite .    here",
    "we develop an integral formalism for the three - body ( two - proton ) decay width in a different way .",

    "the core - proton fsi is much more efficient for width enhancement than @xmath123-@xmath123 fsi .",
    "this fact is correlated with the observation of the previous point and is a very simple and strong indication that the wide - spread perception of the two - proton decay as `` diproton '' decay is to some extent misleading . as it has already been mentioned the @xmath123-@xmath123 fsi influences the penetration strongly in the very special case when the decay occurs from high-@xmath29 orbitals ( e.g.  @xmath175 in the case of @xmath2fe ) .",
    "thus we should consider as not fully consistent the attempts to explain two - proton decay results only by the fsi in the @xmath123-@xmath123 channel ( e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) as much stronger decay mechanism is neglected in these studies .    from techical point of view",
    "the states considered in this work belong to the most complicated cases .",
    "the complication is due to the ratio between the decay energy and the strength of the coulomb interaction ( it defines the subbarrier penetration range to be considered dynamically ) .",
    "thus the convergence effects demonstrated in this work for @xmath1ne have the strongest character among the systems studied in our previous works @xcite .",
    "because of the relatively small @xmath198 used in the previous works we have found an order of the magnitude underestimation of the @xmath1ne(@xmath0 ) width . for systems like @xmath14ni  @xmath18kr the underestimation of widths in our previous calculations is expected to be about factor of 2 . a much smaller effect is expected for lighter systems .",

    "[ fig : fe - lifetime].,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    it was demonstrated in @xcite that the capture rate for the @xmath21o(@xmath11,@xmath22)@xmath1ne reaction depends strongly on the two - proton width of the first excited @xmath0 state in @xmath1ne .",
    "this width was calculated in ref .  @xcite as @xmath201 mev ( some confusion can be connected with misprint in table iii of ref .",
    "@xcite , see erratum ) . however , in the subsequent work @xcite , providing very similar to @xcite properties of the @xmath1ne wfs for the ground and the lowest excited states , the width of the @xmath0 state was found to be @xmath202 mev .",
    "it was supposed in @xcite that such a strong disagreement is connected with poor subbarrier convergence of the hh method in @xcite compared to adiabatic faddeev hh method of @xcite .",
    "this point was further reiterated in ref.@xcite .",
    "we can see now that this statement has a certain ground .",
    "however , the convergence problems of the hh method are far insufficient to explain the huge disagreement : the width increase found in this work is only one order of magnitude .",
    "the most conservative upper limit @xmath203 mev ( see table [ tab : wid - com ] ) was obtained in a tfsi calculation neglecting @xmath123-@xmath123 coulomb interaction .",
    "the other models systematically produce smaller values , with realistic calculations confined to the narrow range @xmath204 mev ( table [ tab : wid - com-2 ] ) .",
    "thus the value @xmath205 mev obtained in paper @xcite is very likely to be erroneous .",
    "that result is possibly connected with a simplistic quasiclassical procedure for width calculations employed in this work .",
    "in this work we derive the integral formula for the widths of the resonances decaying into the three - body channel for simplified hamiltonians and discuss various aspects of its practical application .",
    "the basic idea of the derivation is not new , but for our specific purpose ( precision solution of the multichannel problem ) several important features of the scheme have not been discussed .",
    "we can draw the following conclusions from our studies .",
    "\\(i ) we presume that hh convergence in realistic calculations should be largely the same as in the simplified calculations as they imitate the most important dynamic aspects of the realistic situation .",
    "the width values were somewhat underestimated in our previous calculations .",
    "the typical underestimation ranges from few percent to tens of percent for `` simple '' potential and from tens of percent to an order of magnitude in `` complicated '' cases ( potentials with repulsive core ) .",
    "\\(ii ) convergence of the width calculations in the three - body hh model can be drastically improved by a simple adiabatic version of the feshbach reduction procedure . for a sufficiently large dynamic sector of the basis the calculation with effective fr potential converges from below and practically up to the exact value of the width . for a small dynamic basis",
    "the fr calculation converges towards a width value smaller than the exact value , but still improves considerably the result .",
    "\\(iii ) the energy distributions obtained in the hh calculations are quite close to the exact ones .",
    "convergence with respect to basis size is achieved at relatively small @xmath171 values .",
    "the disagreement with exact distributions is not very significant and is likely to be connected not with basis size convergence but , with radial extent of the calculations @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) contributions of different decay mechanisms were evaluated in the simplified models .",
    "we have found that the `` diproton '' decay path is much less efficient than the `` sequential '' decay path .",
    "this is true even in the model calculations without nuclear fsis ( no specific dynamics ) , which means that the `` sequential '' decay path is somehow kinematically preferable .",
    "\\(v ) the value of the width for @xmath1ne @xmath0 state was underestimated in our previous works by around an order of magnitude .",
    "a very conservative upper limit is obtained in this work as @xmath206 mev , while typical values for realistic calculations are within the @xmath207 mev range .",
    "thus the value @xmath208 mev obtained in papers @xcite is likely to be erroneous .    from this paper",
    "it is clear that the convergence issue is sufficiently serious , and in some cases were underestimated in our previous works .",
    "however , from practical point of view , the convergence issue is not a principle problem .",
    "for example the uncertain structure issues and subsystem properties impose typically much larger uncertainties for width values . for heavy two - proton emitters",
    "( e.g.  @xmath2fe ) the positions of resonances in the subsystems are experimentally quite uncertain . for a moment",
    "this is the issue most limiting the precision of theoretical predictions .",
    "we have demonstrated that with increased precision the experimental data impose strong restrictions on theoretical calculations allowing to extract an important structure information .",
