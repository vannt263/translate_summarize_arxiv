    "investigations of the physical and chemical properties of metal clusters are currently largely motivated by the question how their various remarkably size - dependent properties could be best utilized while _ the clusters are interacting with the environment _ , e.g. , bound on or implanted in a support , or stabilized and surface - passivated by molecules @xcite .",
    "understanding factors that dictate the stability , structure and function has relevance regarding atomic - scale design of components that could be of potential use in future nanotechnologies .",

    "gold clusters and nanoparticles have attracted much attention recently due to their remarkable chemical and optical properties ( for recent reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "one can quite dramatically affect the catalytic properties of the cluster @xcite .",
    "earlier dft calculations have shown that the finite - size effects in the electronic spectrum of the nanocatalyst play a key role in co oxidation reaction through binding and activating the oxygen molecule via a charge - transfer mechanism .",
    "theoretical predictions @xcite of charging of the catalytically active au@xmath4 cluster , bound at the surface color center @xmath1 of the mgo film , were confirmed very recently by ftir spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic data on structure of supported metal clusters and ultrafine nanoparticles are still relatively scarce , with some notable exceptions from stm and sts spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy is currently a largely unexplored area , although it has long been used to study metal clusters in gas phase @xcite . here",
    "we present a systematic theoretical investigation of the optical properties of mgo - supported gold clusters , au@xmath0/mgo with @xmath5 , by analyzing the optical spectra calculated from the linear response time - depenent dft ( tddft ) .",
    "we discuss ( i ) the effects from the support , particularly from the @xmath1 states , dominating the spectra of @xmath6 , ( ii ) the sensitivity of the spectra to the atomic structure of the cluster with examples for @xmath7 , and finally ( iii ) the sensitivity of the spectra to adsorbants , by taking the example of co and o@xmath3 adsorption on the smallest co - oxidizing cluster au@xmath4/mgo @xcite .",
    "it is shown that for all these cases , _ polarization - resolved _ spectra contain rich information on the nature of the dominant optical transitions and their connection to the structure and shape of the adsorbed cluster .",
    "the atomic and electronic structure of the supported au@xmath0/mgo system ( comprising the vicinity of the color center of the mgo(100 ) surface , the adsorbed au@xmath0 cluster , and o@xmath3 and co molecules ) were calculated within the dft in combination with born - oppenheimer ( bo ) molecular dynamics ( md)@xcite including self - consistent gradient corrections via the so - called pbe - gga functional @xcite .",

    "the mgo surface is modelled by a two - layer ab initio cluster mg@xmath12o@xmath12 or @xmath1@mg@xmath12o@xmath13 , embedded in an extended point - charge lattice to include effects of the long - rage madelung potential @xcite . for the embedding lattice ,",

    "the lattice parameter of the embedding part is fixed to the experimental lattice constant ( 4.21  ) of bulk mgo . the cluster , molecules and nearest - neighbor mg ions to the @xmath1 are treated dynamically in structural optimizations that included both steepest - descent and quenched molecular dynamics runs @xcite .",
    "we follow the formulation of the linear response time dependent dft given by casida , @xcite as implemented in ref .",
    "briefly , in order to get the weights @xmath16 and energies @xmath17 of optical transitions @xmath18 , one solves an eigenvalue problem @xmath19 where the @xmath20 matrix elements are given by @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the difference of the ks particle - hole eigenvalues and occupation numbers , respectively .",

    "the transition matrix element in polarisation direction @xmath27 is @xmath28 and the corresponding polarization - dependent and polarization - averaged oscillator strengths are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the convergence of the spectra ( oscillator strengths and energies of the major peaks ) depends basically on three factors : ( i ) extent of the ks particle - hole basis , ( ii ) size of the plane - wave grid , and ( iii ) size of the ab initio mg@xmath12o@xmath14 cluster .",
    "factors ( i ) and ( ii ) determine the quality of discretization of the continuum virtual states while factor ( iii ) dictates the overall behavior in the optical response of the mgo support - specifically the width of the band gap .",

    "the converged theoretical optical band gap of the support is about 4 ev , which is in a fair agreement with the apparent gap of 6 ev measured for a few - layer thick mgo film @xcite , taking into account the general tendency of dft to underestimate band gaps of wide - gap insulators .",

    "this spectrum was calculated by considering the ( 5d@xmath36 ) ks states in the particle - hole basis .",
    "the ks spectrum consists of two strong transitions corresponding to single - particle excitations of @xmath37 ( 5 ev ) and @xmath38 ( 6.1 ev ) .",
    "the lowest tdlda optical line is found at 5.23 ev and it is an incoherent ( destructive ) superposition of the ks transitions @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( the destructive interference is manifested by the reduced oscillator strength of the 5.23 ev tdlda line compared to the neighboring ks lines ) .",
    "our result of 5.23 ev is in a fair agreement with the lowest experimental spin - orbit ( so ) split transitions at 4.63 ev ( @xmath39 , final single - particle state assigned as ( @xmath40 ) ) and 5.11 ev ( @xmath41 ) @xcite taking into account the fact that the so effect is not included in our calculations . similarly , the next strong tdlda transition at 7.3 ev corresponds to the experimental so doublet 7.44 ev and 7.53 ev , assigned to transitions to the @xmath42 states with a ( @xmath43 single - particle configuration @xcite .",

    "the identical oscillator strengths in the x , y , z directions and the degeneracy pattern strongly suggest that these transitions mainly originate from the au atom , perturbed and shifted by the support .",

    "this finding can be correlated to _",
