    "for anosov systems ( ) , both diffeomorphisms and flows , interesting phenomena of smooth and geometric rigidity have been observed in connection with the degree of ( transverse ) regularity of the ( weak ) stable and unstable subbundles of these systems .",
    "the seminal result was the study of volume - preserving anosov flows on 3-manifolds by hurder and katok @xcite , which showed that the weak - stable and weak - unstable foliations are @xmath1 and that there is an obstruction to higher regularity whose vanishing implies smoothness of these foliations .",
    "this , in turn , happens only if the anosov flow is smoothly conjugate to an algebraic one .",
    "the cocycle obstruction described by _",

    "_ a__nosov and is the first nonlinear coefficient in the _ _",
    "m__oser normal form",
    ". therefore one might call it the _ kam_-cocycle .",
    "this should not be confused with `` kam '' as in `` kolmogorov  arnold  moser '' , and hurder and katok refer to this object as the _ anosov - cocycle_.    in @xcite we showed some analogous rigidity features associated with the _ longitudinal _ direction , associated with various degrees of regularity of the sum of the _ strong _ stable and unstable subbundles : for a volume - preserving anosov flow on a 3-manifold the strong stable and unstable foliations are zygmund - regular ( * ? ? ?",

    "then @xmath6 is zygmund - regular and there is an obstruction to higher regularity that defines the cohomology class of a cocycle we call the _ longitudinal kam - cocycle_. this obstruction can be described geometrically as the curvature of the image of a transversal under a return map , and the following are equivalent :    1 .",

    "we study the _",

    "( ) of the time - change of a geodesic flow or of the suspension of an infranilmanifoldautomorphism , and because we only have lipschitz - continuity at our disposal , we need to explore how smooth - rigidity results can be pushed to the lowest conceivable regularity .",
    "this requires two main results . on one hand , a lipschitz - continuous 1-form whose exterior derivative is invariant under the geodesic flow of a negatively curved locally symmetric space must be ( a constant multiple of ) the canonical 1-form for the flow .",
    "on the other hand , an essentially bounded 2-form invariant under an infranilmanifoldautomorphism is smooth .",
    "a special case of the second result is that in which the 2-form arises as the exterior derivative of a lipschitz - continuous 1-form , in which case it vanishes .",
    "thus , both results involve exterior calculus of lipschitz - continuous 1-forms .",
    "it is clear that this has to be done with care , and we invoke results to the effect that , for instance , the classical stokes theorem holds for lipschitz - continuous forms @xcite .    given this common motivation , it is surprising that our two separate results involve rather different arguments for geodesic flows on one hand and suspensions on the other hand .",
    "a particular point of interest is in this respect that while , like with many other results in hyperbolic dynamics , ergodic theory enters the proof in the case of geodesic flows only to the extent that we use ergodicity of the geodesic flow , it turns out that for the case of a suspension we use in an essential way that the infranilmanifoldautomorphism is indeed mixing rather than merely ergodic .",
    "this reflects the need to deal with parabolic effects due to the nilpotent part .",
    "we now introduce the notions that play a role in this result and the proof .",
    "an anosov flow on a manifold @xmath2 is a smooth flow @xmath8 with    * an invariant decomposition @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the generator of the flow and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are called the unstable and stable subbundles ) and * a riemannian metric on @xmath2 such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are contractions whenever @xmath15 .",

    "it follows from lipschitz - continuity and hence from differentiability .",
    "being `` little zygmund '' implies having modulus of continuity @xmath41 and follows from differentiability but not from lipschitz - continuity .",
    "the regularity of the unstable subbundle @xmath11 is usually substantially lower than that of the weak - unstable subbundle @xmath42 .",
    "the exception are geodesic flows , where the strong unstable subbundle is obtained from the weak - unstable subbundle by intersecting with the kernel of the invariant contact form .",
    "this has the effect that the strong - unstable and weak - unstable subbundles have the same regularity .",
    "however , time changes affect the regularity of the strong - unstable subbundle , and this is what typically keeps its regularity below @xmath43 .",
    "in @xcite we presented a _",
    "longitudinal kam - cocycle _ that is the obstruction to differentiability , and we derived higher regularity from its vanishing .",
    "let @xmath2 be a 3-manifold , @xmath3 , @xmath4 a @xmath5 volume - preserving anosov flow .",
    "then @xmath6 is zygmund - regular , and there is an obstruction to higher regularity that can be described geometrically as the curvature of the image of a transversal under a return map .",

    "no stronger rigidity should be expected because @xmath6 is smooth for all suspensions and contact flows .",
    "see @xcite for applications of this to magnetic flows .",
    "the work by hurder and katok in @xcite inspired developments of substantial extensions to higher dimensions , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the present work extends our earlier work to higher - dimensional systems in this `` longitudinal '' context .",

    "an anosov flow is said to be _ uniformly quasiconformal _ if @xmath45 is bounded on @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the _ conorm _ of a linear map @xmath18 .",
    "the proof that [ itemzygmund].@xmath48[itemkamcobdy].@xmath48[itemlipschitz ] .  in largely follows the line of reasoning already presented in @xcite and appears in @xcite .    in the 3-dimensional case we showed that smoothness of",
    "@xmath6 implies that @xmath7 is a suspension or contact flow , but in the present situation we obtain more detailed information because of the quasiconformality - assumption .",
    "this uses a rigidity theorem by fang :    let @xmath2 be a compact riemannian manifold and @xmath4 a transversely symplectic anosov flow with @xmath49 and @xmath50",

    "this also serves to illustrate that the assumption of uniform quasiconformality is quite restrictive .",
    "we should also point out that our result about rigidity of the situation with @xmath52 overlaps with a closely related one by fang , although the proof is independent :    let @xmath7 be a @xmath51 volume - preserving quasiconformal anosov flow .",

    "after introducing some background on canonical time - changes , we outline how to establish and .",
    "we make a few remarks here about canonical time - changes ( ) because these are not frequently encountered in the literature ; they may serve to show why this is a natural class of time - changes to expect in rigidity results for flows .",
    "consider a flow @xmath8 generated by the vector field @xmath17 and a smooth function @xmath59 such that @xmath60",
    ". then @xmath61 conjugates the flow generated by the vector field @xmath62 to @xmath8 .",
    "smoothness of @xmath26 and @xmath60 ensure that @xmath63 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "now we write @xmath64 and use the chain rule to compute @xmath65 which gives @xmath66 upon division by @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath21 and @xmath68 are cohomologous closed 1-forms with @xmath69 and @xmath70 then the associated canonical time - changes of @xmath17 are smoothly conjugate .",
    "this tells us that the cohomology class of @xmath21 is the material ingredient in a canonical time - change by @xmath21 .",

    "suppose @xmath73 generates an anosov flow , and @xmath21 is a closed 1-form such that @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath75 denotes the canonical form for @xmath73 then @xmath76 is the canonical form for @xmath77 .",
    "this shows , in particular , that canonical time - changes with smooth closed forms do not affect the regularity of the canonical form .",
    "we first note that two invariant 1-forms for an anosov flow are proportional : both being constant on @xmath17 , this follows from the fact that a continuous 1-form that vanishes on @xmath17 is trivial ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) .",

    "also @xmath79 which implies that @xmath80 , @xmath18 is @xmath17-invariant and hence proportional to the canonical 1-form of @xmath17 . but",
    "@xmath19 then implies that @xmath18 is equal to the canonical 1-form of @xmath17 .",
    "the results that imply and are of independent interest and will therefore appear in a separate publication from the application @xcite to quasiconformal anosov flows .",
    "let @xmath2 be a compact locally symmetric space with negative sectional curvature and suppose @xmath18 is a lipschitz - continuous 1-form such that @xmath81 is invariant under the geodesic flow .",
    "then @xmath18 is @xmath51 , and indeed @xmath81 is a constant multiple of the exterior derivative of the canonical 1-form for the geodesic flow .",
    "note that the lipschitz assumption ensures that @xmath81 is defined almost everywhere and essentially bounded @xcite .",
    "this is all we use . for comparison , we state an earlier result of hamenstdt :",
    "if the anosov splitting of the geodesic flow of a compact negatively curved manifold is @xmath43 and @xmath18 is a @xmath43 1-form such that @xmath81 is invariant , then @xmath81 is proportional to the exterior derivative of the canonical 1-form of the geodesic flow .    the hypotheses of and of imply smoothness ; we need to show that the vector field @xmath17 that generates the time - change agrees with a canonical time - change of a constantly scaled version of @xmath73 , where @xmath73 generates the geodesic flow .",
    "rescale @xmath73 to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is defined by @xmath84 and then apply the canonical time - change defined by the 1-form @xmath85 . since the resulting vector field @xmath86 is a scalar multiple of @xmath17 , the claim follows from @xmath87 where we used @xmath88 . that the last denominator is @xmath89 and hence positive justifies the use of @xmath90 to define a canonical time - change .",
    "let @xmath56 be a hyperbolic automorphism of a torus or a infranilmanifold @xmath57 .",
    "then any essentially bounded invariant 2-form is almost everywhere equal to an @xmath2-invariant ( hence smooth ) closed 2-form .",
    "if , in addition , the form is exact , then it vanishes almost everywhere .",
    "we point out that in this proof we use that the automorphism is mixing ( rather than just ergodic ) .",
    "the need for this is an interesting side - light on how parabolic effects enter into our considerations .",
    "denote by @xmath18 the canonical form of the time - change and by @xmath91 the canonical form of the suspension .",
    "applied to @xmath18 implies that @xmath18 is smooth and closed , and hence so is @xmath92 since @xmath91 is also closed .",
    "writing @xmath73 for the suspension vector field we find that the canonical time - change @xmath93 of @xmath73 is the given vector field since by construction @xmath94 .",
    "using exterior calculus ( carefully ! )",
    "we show that @xmath18 is a contact form , @xmath95 is a volume , and that @xmath73 is in the kernel of @xmath81 . by duality , for every @xmath96",
    "there is a @xmath97 such that @xmath98this is defined whenever @xmath81 is , and we choose @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we next show that @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is a nilpotent operator .",
    "the main effort is now directed at showing that @xmath104 , that @xmath105 ( smoothness of @xmath18 can then be obtained via some delicate exterior calculus ) . to that end we @xmath106-approximate @xmath103 by a continuous operator , take the birkhoff average of this approximation ( which does not change the @xmath106-distance to @xmath103 ) and show that it is defined and continuous everywhere and so intertwined with the flow that one can apply arguments from @xcite to conclude that it vanishes identically .",
    "thus @xmath103 is arbitrarily @xmath106-close to 0 and hence vanishes itself .",
    "taking birkhoff averages of the continuous @xmath106-approximation @xmath107 of @xmath103 requires substantial technical underpinnings because the birkhoff ergodic theorem applies to scalar functions .",
    "therefore we show that we can choose a measurable orthonormal frame field for @xmath11 on @xmath2 that consists of vector fields @xmath96 chosen in such a way that    * @xmath96 is continuous and @xmath108-parallel along unstable leaves that are homeomorphic to euclidean space , nonperiodic leaves , * @xmath109 for @xmath110 or @xmath111 , * if @xmath109 then the lie bracket with the generator @xmath17 of the geodesic flow is @xmath112=\\dc_x\\xi+j\\xi = j\\xi$ ] ( the last equality uses that @xmath96 is @xmath108-parallel ) and hence @xmath113 .    here",
    "@xmath108 is a kanai connection constructed for this purpose ( as in @xcite ) , and its properties produce such a frame field .",
    "we use that the geodesic flow of a locally symmetric space admits an invariant splitting of the unstable subbundle into fast- and slow - unstable bundles corresponding to the exponents @xmath114 and @xmath115 ; we write @xmath116 . in the constant - curvature case",
    "we have @xmath117 .",
    "we next show that the birkhoff average of @xmath107 has a continuous extension @xmath118 to the entire manifold that is parallel along stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "we then follow arguments in @xcite to show that this implies @xmath119 and hence @xmath104 .",
    "one can write a 2-form _ locally _ as @xmath123 , and we will look for a way of doing so _ globally _ and with constant coefficients . to that end",
    "we pass to the complexification of the tangent bundle and work with a basis of @xmath103-invariant sections @xmath124 .    at one point",
    "we choose a basis in such a way that @xmath56 is in jordan canonical form with respect to the dual basis consisting of the forms @xmath125 , @xmath126 with @xmath127 in jordan form ( strictly triangular since we passed to the complexification ) .",
    "now translate the basis and the dual basis by @xmath103 to get invariant sections . with these choices ,",
    "a jordan block for eigenvalue @xmath128 for the @xmath58th iterate is of the form @xmath129 with @xmath130 a fixed polynomial in @xmath58",
    ".    now denote by @xmath131 the matrix that represents @xmath132 with respect to the invariant frame field .",

    "fix such an @xmath137 and decompose @xmath138 into ( not necessarily square or diagonal ) blocks @xmath139 according to the jordan form of @xmath18 , in such a way that @xmath140where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the sizes of the blocks @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively . for any @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath137",
    ", @xmath147 is a matrix - valued polynomial in @xmath58 , and indeed it is constant :        this shows that every entry of the matrix @xmath138 is almost everywhere equal to an eigenfunction of @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath56 is mixing , all eigenfunctions are constant , and hence @xmath138 is almost everywhere equal to an @xmath2-invariant ( hence smooth ) 2-form .    to prove the last assertion of , that @xmath138 vanishes if it is exact , we introduce a notion of averaging .",
    "let @xmath155 be the @xmath103-invariant complex - valued volume form defined by the dual basis we used before . by compactness , this gives a finite volume .",
    "then for any @xmath156-form @xmath157 we define the _ average _ @xmath158 and prove that @xmath159 for any 1-form @xmath21 .",
