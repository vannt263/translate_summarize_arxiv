    "many network infrastructures : power grids , airline networks , and the internet , are embedded in a metric space , and long - range links are relatively restricted @xcite for economical reasons .",
    "the spatial distribution of nodes is neither uniformly at random nor on a regular lattice , which is often assumed in the conventional network models . in real data ,",
    "a population density is mapped to the number of router nodes on earth @xcite .",
    "similar spatially inhomogeneous distributions of nodes are found in air transportation networks @xcite and in mobile communication networks @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not trivial how to locate nodes on a space in a pattern formation of points .",
    "point processes in spatial statistics @xcite provide models for irregular patterns of points in urban planing , astronomy , forestry , or ecology , such as spatial distributions of rainfall , germinations , plants , and animals .",
    "the processes assume homogeneous poisson and gibbs distributions to generate a pattern of random packing or independent clustering , and to estimate parameters of competitive potential functions in a territory model for a given statistical data , respectively .",
    "however , rather than random pattern and statistical estimation , * we focus on a self - organized network infrastructure by taking into account realistic spatial distributions of nodes and communication requests*. in particular , we aim to develop adaptive and scalable ad hoc networks by adding the links between proximity nodes according to the increasing of communication requests . because a spatial distribution of communication requests affect the proper positions of nodes , which control both the load of requests assigned to each node ( e.g. , assigned at the nearest access point of node as a base - station from a user ) and the communication efficiency depending on the selection of routing paths .    for a routing in ad hoc networks , global information ,",
    "e.g. , a routing table in the internet , can not be applied , because many nodes and connections between them are likely to change over time . in early works on computer science",
    ", some decentralized routing methods were developed to reduce energy consumption in sensor or mobile networks .",
    "however they lead to the failure of guaranteed delivery @xcite ; in the flooding algorithm , multiple redundant copies of a message are sent and cause congestion , while greedy and compass routings may occasionally fall into infinite loops or into a dead end .",
    "in complex network science , other efficient decentralized routing methods have been also proposed .",
    "the stochastic methods by using local information of the node degrees and other measures are called preferential @xcite and congestion - aware @xcite routings as extensions of a uniformly random walk .",
    "decentralized routing has a potential performance to search a target whose position is unknown in advance .",
    "since this situation looks like foraging , the biological strategy may be useful for the efficient search .",
    "* we are interested in a relation of the search and the routing on a spatially inhomogeneous network structure according to a population*. many experimental observations for biological foraging found the evidence in favor of anomalous diffusion in the movement of insects , fishes , birds , mammals and human being @xcite .",
    "as the consistent result , it has been theoretically analyzed for a continuous space model that an inverse square root distribution of flight lengths is an optimal strategy to search sparsely and randomly located targets on a homegeneous space @xcite .",
    "the discrete space models on a regular lattice @xcite and the defective one @xcite are also discussed .",
    "such behavior is called _ levy flight _ characterized by a distribution function @xmath0 with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a flight length between nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the stochastic movement for any direction .",
    "the values of @xmath5 lead to brownian motions , while @xmath6 to ballistic motions .",
    "the optimal case is @xmath7 for maximizing the efficiency of search . here , we assume that the mobility of a node is ignored due to a sufficiently slow speed in comparison with the communication process . in the current or future technologies , wide - area wireless connections by directional beams will be possible , the modeling of unit disk graph with a constant transmission range is not necessary .",
    "thus , * we propose a scalably self - organized geographical network and show that the naturally embedded fractal - like structure is suitable for searching targets more efficiently than the square lattice tracked by the levy flights*.",
    "geographical constructions of complex networks have been proposed so far . as a typical generation mechanism of",
    "scale - free ( sf ) networks that follow a power law degree distribution found in many real systems @xcite , a spatially preferential attachment is applied in some extensions @xcite from the topological degree based model @xcite to a combination of degree and distance based model .",
    "the original preferential attachment is known as `` rich gets richer '' rule that means a higher degree node tend to get more links . on the other hand ,",
    "geometric construction methods have also been proposed .",
    "they have both small - world @xcite and sf structures generated by a recursive growing rule for the division of a chosen triangle @xcite or for the attachment aiming at a chosen edge @xcite in random or hierarchical selections .",
    "these models are proper for the analysis of degree distribution due to the regularly recursive generation process . although the position of a newly added node is basically free as far as the geometric operations are possible , it has no relation to population . considering the effects of population on a geographical network",
    "is necessary to self - organize a spatial distribution of nodes that is suitable for socioeconomic communication and transportation requests .",
    "moreover , in these geometric methods , narrow triangles with long links tend to be constructed , and adding only one node per step may lead to exclude other topologies from the sf structure .",
    "unfortunately , sf networks are extremely vulnerable against the intentional hub attacks @xcite",
    ". we should develop other self - organizations of network apart from the conventional models ; e.g. a better network without long links can be constructed by subdivisions of equilateral triangle which is a well balanced ( neither fat nor thin ) shape for any directions .",
    "thus , we have considered the multi - scale quartered ( msq ) network model @xcite .",
    "it is based on a stochastic construction by a self - similar tiling of primitive shape , such as an equilateral triangle or square .",
    "the msq networks have several advantages of the strong robustness of connectivity against node removals by random failures and intentional attacks , the bounded short path as @xmath8-spanner @xcite , and the efficient face routing by using only local information .",
    "furthermore , the msq networks are more efficient ( economic ) with shorter link lengths and more suitable ( tolerant ) with lower load for avoiding traffic congestion @xcite than the state - of - the - art geometric growing networks @xcite and the spatially preferential attachment models @xcite with various topologies ranging from river to sf geographical networks .",
    "however , in the msq networks , the position of a new node is restricted on the half - point of an edge of the chosen face , and the link length is proportional to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the depth number of iterative divisions .",
    "thus , from square to rectangle , we generalize the division procedures as follows .",
    "step0 : : :    set an initial square whose inside are the candidates of division axes    as the segments of a @xmath11 lattice .",
    "step1 : : :    at each time step , a face is chosen with a probability proportional to    the population counted in the face covered by mesh blocks of a census    data .",
    "step2 : : :    four smaller rectangles are created from the division of the chosen    rectangle face by horizontal and vertical axes . for the division ,",
    "two    axes are chosen by that their cross point is the nearest to the    population barycenter of the face .",
    "step3 : : :    return to step 1 , while the network size ( the total number of nodes )    @xmath12 does not exceed a given size .",
    "note that the maximum size @xmath13 depends on the value of @xmath14 ; the iteration of division is finitely stopped , since the extreme rectangle can not be divided any longer when one of the edge lengths of rectangle is the initial lattice s unit length .",
    "we use the population data on a map in @xmath15 of @xmath16 mesh blocks ( @xmath17 ) provided by the japan statistical association .",
    "of course , other date is possible .",
    "it is worth noting that the positions of nodes and the network topology are simultaneously determined by the divisions of faces within the fractal - like structure .",
    "there exists a mixture of sparse and dense parts of nodes with small and large faces .",
    "moreover , with the growing network , the divisions of faces perform a load balancing of nodes in their adaptively changed territories for the population .",
    "we emphasize that such a network is constructed according to a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of population which is proportional to communication requests in a realistic environment . in the following ,",
    "we show the naturally embedded fractal - like structure are suitable for searching targets .",
    "as a preliminary , we consider the preferential routing @xcite which is also called @xmath18-random walk @xcite ; the forwarding node @xmath4 is chosen proportionally to @xmath19 by a walker in the connected one hop neighbors @xmath20 of its resident node @xmath3 of a walker ( packet ) , where @xmath21 denotes the degree of node @xmath4 and @xmath18 is a real parameter .",
    "we assume that the start position of walker is set to the nearest node to the population barycenter of the initial square .",
    "figure [ fig_vis_freq_link ] shows the length distribution of visited links .",
    "the dashed lines in log - log plot imply a power law , for which the exponents estimated as the slopes by a mean - square - error method are 2.336 , 2.315 , and 2.296 for @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "these values are close to the optimal exponent @xmath7 @xcite in the levy flight on a square lattice .",
    "the exponents for the @xmath18-random walks slightly increase as the network size @xmath12 becomes larger . here , the case of @xmath23 shows the distribution of existing links on a network .",
    "since the stationary probability of incoming at node @xmath4 is @xmath24 @xcite , especially at @xmath23 , each of the connected links to @xmath4 is chosen at random by the probability @xmath25 for the leaving from @xmath4 , therefore a walker visit each link at the same number .",
    "figure [ fig_visualization ] shows that the frequency of visited links by the @xmath18-random walks at @xmath26 is different even for the degrees 3 and 4 in a generalized msq network . on the thick lines , a walker tends to visit high population ( diagonal ) areas colored by orange and red in the case of @xmath27 , while it tends to visit low population peripheral ( corner ) areas in the case of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the case of @xmath27 is expected to selectively cover high population areas which has a lot of communication requests in cities .",
    "note that the absolute value of @xmath18 should be not too large , since a walker is trapped between high / low degree nodes in a long time as the ping - pong phenomena which does not contribute to the search of targets .",
    "-random walker in @xmath29 time steps .",
    "the marks of blue diamond , black circle , and red triangle correspond to the cases of @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "these results are obtained by the average of 100 networks for @xmath30.,height=275 ]    -random walks at @xmath27 ( top ) and @xmath28 ( bottom ) on a generalized msq network for @xmath31 .",
    "the thickness of link indicates the frequency of visiting in @xmath29 time steps . from light to dark : white , yellow , and orange to red , the color gradation on a mesh block is proportionally assigned to the population .",
    "many nodes represented as cross points of links concentrate on high population ( dark : orange and red ) areas on the diagonal direction . in the upper left and lower right of square , corner triangle areas lighted by almost white are the sea of japan and the hakusan mountain range.,height=377 ]    we investigate the search efficiency for the @xmath18-random walk on a generalized msq network , and compare the efficiency with that for levy flights on a @xmath11 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_scan_search ] , a walker constantly looks for targets ( destination nodes of packets ) scanning on a link between two nodes in the generalized msq network .",
    "if a target exists in the vision area of @xmath32 hops for the up / down / left / right directions from the center position , a walker gets it and return to the position on the link for continuing the search on the same direction .",
    "when more than one targets exit in the area , a walker gets all of them successively in each direction , and return to the position . only at a node of rectangle ,",
    "the search direction is changeable along one of the connected links .",
    "thus , the search is restricted on the edges of rectangle in the generalized msq network .",
    "while the search direction of a levy flight on the square lattice @xcite is selectable from four directions of horizontal and vertical at all times after getting a target in the scanning with the vision area of @xmath32 hops , moreover , the length of scan follows @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "we set a target at the position chosen proportionally to the population around a cross point in @xmath35 , for which the population is defined by the average of four values in its contact mesh regions .",
    "in particular , we discuss the destructive case @xcite : once a target is detected by a walker , then it is removed and a new target is created at a different position chosen with the above probability .        the search efficiency @xcite is defined by @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the traversed distance counted by the lattice s unit length until detecting @xmath39 targets from the total @xmath40 targets in the @xmath41th run .",
    "we consider a variety of @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for investigating the dependency of the search efficiency on the number @xmath40 of targets .",
    "the quantity @xmath44 represents the mean interval between two targets for the scaling of efficiency by target density .",
    "we set @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the convenience of simulation .",
    "intuitively , the sparse and dense structures according to the network size @xmath12 have the advantage and disadvantage in order to raise the search efficiency in the generalized msq network .",
    "although the scanned areas are limited by some large rectangle holes as @xmath12 is small , a walker preferably visits the high population areas which include many targets .",
    "while the scanned areas are densely covered as @xmath12 is large , the search direction is constrained on long links of a collapse rectangle , therefore it is rather hard for a walker to escape from a local area in which targets are a few .     on a generalized msq network for @xmath31 and of a levy flight ( bottom ) for @xmath47 on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions until detecting @xmath39 targets in @xmath48 .",
    "black circle , red circles , and gray rectangle marks denote the start point at the population barycenter , the existing targets , and the removed targets after the detections , respectively .",

    ", a walker tends to cover a local area with high population and a wider area , respectively . without wandering peripheral wasteful areas , the generalized msq network has a more efficient structure than the square lattice for detecting many targets concentrated on the diagonal areas . here",
