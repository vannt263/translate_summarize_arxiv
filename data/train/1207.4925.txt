    "a proper understanding of the properties of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei is important due to several reasons .",
    "these systems provide the unique opportunity to obtain information about the hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath4 ) interaction@xcite , which is crucial for a complete understanding of the octet of baryons ( @xmath5 ) in a unified way .",
    "they also supplement the information about the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interaction that is mostly extracted from the studies of the single-@xmath0 hypernuclei@xcite .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath6 and @xmath4 interactions is necessary for making extrapolations to understand the properties of both finite as well as bulk strange hadronic matter@xcite and the neutron stars@xcite .",
    "the study of the @xmath1 hypernuclei is also of interest in connection with the possible existence of the strangeness ( @xmath7 ) -2 , six - quark @xmath8 dibaryon resonance with spin parity of @xmath9 and isospin @xmath10@xcite .",
    "precisely measured binding energies of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei put a lower limit on the @xmath8 dibaryon mass@xcite .",
    "the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei were first observed in the 1960s@xcite in the studies of stopped @xmath11 hyperons in emulsions .",
    "two decades later , modern emulsion - counter hybrid techniques have been applied in the kek - e176 experiment where a new double-@xmath0 hypernucleus event was found@xcite .",
    "later on , in another hybrid emulsion experiment ( kek - e373 ) an unambiguous identification of the hypernucleus , @xmath12he , was made with a precise value of the binding energy of two @xmath0 hyperons@xcite .",
    "this is known as the nagara event .",
    "recently , in a reanalysis of the double-@xmath0 hypernuclear data produced in the kek - e176 and kek - e373 experiments , results for the @xmath1 binding energies have been reported for @xmath12he , @xmath13be , @xmath14be , and @xmath15b hypernuclei@xcite .",
    "these observations have led to a number of theoretical studies where several approaches have been used to investigate the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "calculations have been performed within the three- and four - body cluster models using the effective interactions or the @xmath16-matrices@xcite . among other approaches",
    "are the faddeev@xcite , variational monte - carlo@xcite , and variational six - body@xcite calculations .",
    "furthermore , both nonrelativistic and relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models have also been used to predict the binding energies of such nuclei@xcite . in ref .",
    "48 the two-@xmath0 binding energies of several double-@xmath0 nuclei between @xmath12he to @xmath15b were calculated within a shell model approach .",
    "furthermore , using the interaction nsc97c of the nijmegen group , the calculations for the @xmath1 bond energies were reported in ref.@xcite within a @xmath16-matrix approach where the couplings between @xmath1 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels were included . in these calculations",
    "moderate to good success has been achieved in predicting the two-@xmath0 binding and the @xmath1 bond energies .",
    "the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) model provides a self - consistent description of nuclear ground state properties@xcite and it has been shown to be a powerful tool for investigating the gross properties of the nonstrange nuclei(see , e.g. , a recent review@xcite ) .",
    "a clear advantage of this method is that it involves the complete summation of tadpole diagrams@xcite .",
    "the extension of this model to describe the single-@xmath0 hypernuclei was presented in refs .",
    "54 and 55 . for calculating such strange nuclei ,",
    "one requires , in addition to the skyrme @xmath2 force , also the skyrme @xmath3 interaction . in ref .",
    "56 the latter was determined from a bruckner - hartree - fock calculation of the hypernuclear matter using the nijmegen potentials nsc97a and nsc97f , which was used in an extended shf scheme to determine the properties of single-@xmath0 hypernuclei . in this",
    "study the binding energies of the hypernuclei were somewhat overpredicted . in ref .",
    "57 several sets of the skyrme @xmath3 interactions were determined by fitting to the modern data on the binding energies of nearly twenty single-@xmath0 hypernuclei , which were used in the shf model to describe the known properties of such nuclei over a wide mass range .    in this paper , we present an extention of the shf method of ref .  57 to the calculations of the two-@xmath0 binding energies @xmath19 and the @xmath1 bond energies @xmath20 of the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei . unlike a few previous studies within similar approach where calculations were limited to a few lighter systems , we have applied this method to investigate the properties of the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei with masses covering essentially the entire range of the periodic table .",
    "in fact the shf method provides an ideal approach for describing the heavier systems .    in calculations of the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei",
    ", one needs as input the @xmath1 interaction in addition to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 forces .",
    "several phenomenological , meson - exchange motivated , and quark model based forms have been employed for the @xmath1 force in the literature@xcite .",
    "we have , however , taken phenomenological skyrme type of parameterizations for this force proposed in refs .",
    "39 and 66 . in ref .",
    "39 three sets of parameters for the @xmath1 interaction were determined by fitting to the @xmath1 bond energy of @xmath21b ground state ( @xmath22 mev ) . in ref .",
    "66 , four additional sets of the parameters were obtained by considering the results of a recent experimental analysis@xcite , in which a smaller bond energy ( @xmath23 mev ) for the @xmath24b ground state has been reported .",
    "we remark , however , that these forces are too simple and lack several important effects .",
    "for example , they neglect the three - body interactions and the possible conversion of the @xmath1 to @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels . these constitute the important parts of the hyperon - hyperon interaction@xcite and neglecting them",
    "could bring in significant uncertainty in the calculations .",
    "nevertheless , our aim in this paper is to extend and establish our shf method for describing the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei . for this purpose",
    "we have taken these forces , which were also used in previous shf type calculations of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei reported in refs .",
    "39 , 66 and 68 . particularly noteworthy",
    "are the latter two references where these forces were employed to investigate the fission barriers of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei in the actinide region and the properties of neutron stars , respectively .",
    "the total energy density functional ( edf ) of a double-@xmath0 hypernucleus ( @xmath25 ) includes contributions from the total energy densities of nucleons ( neutron and proton ) ( @xmath26 ) and of hyperons ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath25 has terms arising from the pairing energy and the center of mass corrections , which are taken to be similar to those described in ref .",
    "@xmath26 is related to the nucleon hamiltonian density ( @xmath28 ) as @xmath29 the form of @xmath28 is the same as that given in ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath27 is given by @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) the hyperon hamiltonian density , @xmath31 , is the sum of two terms , @xmath32 in eq . ( 3 ) , @xmath33 has the same form as that described in ref .",
    "57 for the case of the single-@xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "the second term , @xmath34 , is attributed to the @xmath1 interaction and is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the hyperon density and @xmath37 is the corresponding kinetic energy density .",
    "@xmath38 , is the nucleon density . @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the parameters of the @xmath1 force that will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 in the last term is assumed to be 1/3 . in eq .",
    "( [ h_ll ] ) , we have omitted terms corresponding to the @xmath0 spin density .",
    "the wave functions for the proton , neutron and the @xmath0 particle are calculated from the shf equations ; @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents a nucleon ( proton or neutron ) , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the single - particle energies of the nucleon and the @xmath0 particle , respectively .",
    "the purely nuclear mean field potential [ @xmath49 $ ] , the additional field created by the @xmath0 hyperon that is seen by a nucleon [ @xmath50 $ ] , and the whole nuclear field experience by a @xmath0 hyperon [ @xmath51 have the same forms as those given in ref .  57 .",
    "@xmath52 , which is the field generated by the @xmath1 interaction , is given by    @xmath53    the last term in eq .",
    "( [ pot_ll ] ) corresponds to the three - body @xmath54 interaction . in actual calculations ,",
    "this term is dropped .",
    "while the nucleon effective mass remains the same as that described in ref .",
    "57 , the @xmath0 effective mass , @xmath55 , acquires additional terms due to the presence of @xmath56 , @xmath57\\rho_{n}+ \\frac{1}{8}[\\lambda_{1}+3\\lambda_{2}]\\rho_{\\lambda},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the parameters of the @xmath3 force as defined in ref .  57 . without the last term",
    "this equation is the same as that given in ref .",
    "57 for the effective mass of the single-@xmath0 hyperon .",
    "the main quantity in @xmath1 hypernuclei is the @xmath1 bond energy , which is defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the separation energy of one @xmath0 hyperon from the @xmath62 hypernucleus and @xmath63 is that of two @xmath0 hyperons from the @xmath64 hypernucleus , respectively .",
    "the separation energies are evaluated by solving the appropriate hartree - fock equations and by using the energy relations given in ref .",
    "57 . in terms of the total binding energies ( @xmath65 )",
    ", the bond energy can be expressed as @xmath66 .",
    "it is clear that possible uncertainties in the center of mass treatment are mostly canceled in the bond energy .",
    "before , presenting results for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , it would be of interest to discuss our shf calculations for the single-@xmath0 separation energies @xmath69 , as they will be used in obtaining @xmath70 [ see , eq .",
    "this will be done very briefly here because all the details are given in@xcite . in fig .  1 , we show the @xmath71 dependence of the calculated @xmath69 of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 shells of various single-@xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "the corresponding available experimental data are also shown in this figure . in these calculations forces",
    "sly4 ( ref .",
    "69 ) and hp@xmath02 ( ref .",
    "57 ) have been used for @xmath2 and @xmath3 interactions , respectively .",
    "we note that apart from the a=208 case , where we see some underbinding of the @xmath72 orbital , our calculations are in close agreement with the experimental @xmath69 .",
    "thus our shf model with @xmath3 force hp@xmath02 provides a good description of the single-@xmath0 separation energies for the lighter as well as heavier systems .",
    ".parameters for the @xmath76 interaction .",
    "the last column gives the ranges of `` equivalent single gaussian '' potentials . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "3 , we show the sensitivity of @xmath68 to the @xmath3 force . in these calculations parameters",
    "sets sly4 and s@xmath77 have been used for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 interactions , respectively . for the @xmath3 force",
    "we have used sets hp@xmath78 , n@xmath79 and o@xmath79 of ref.@xcite .",
    "it may be recalled here that while the set hp@xmath78 provides a good agreement with the experimental binding energies of the @xmath0 single - particle states of all the orbitals in the entire mass range of hypernuclei ( see fig .  1 ) , the parameter sets o@xmath79 and n@xmath79 slightly overestimate the data for the lighter nuclei ( we refer to ref .  57 for a detailed discussion of this points ) .",
    "in fig .  3 , we note that even the currently available sparse data clearly favor the parameter set hp@xmath78 .",
    "it should , however , be added that the bond energy as defined by eq .",
    "( 9 ) is more applicable to those cases where the core nuclei @xmath80z have zero spin . in case of the nonzero spin core nucleus ,",
    "the @xmath69 appearing in eq .",
    "( 9 ) is actually an average of the binding energies of the spin - doublet states@xcite .",
    "the bond energy is also influenced by the structural changes that are caused to the core nucleus due to the @xmath0-core interaction ( e.g. , the core polarization@xcite ) .",
    "the core polarization effects are significant for @xmath3 potentials that are strongly polarizing .",
    "however , the @xmath1 forces used in this study have been extracted by fitting the data with shf calculation where the used @xmath3 interactions lead to small core polarization energy in @xmath81b@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spin - doublet splitting in @xmath81b is probably small@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an alternative definition of the @xmath1 bond energy is suggested in ref .",
    "34 , where it is essentially determined by the strength of the @xmath82 interaction .",
    "however , the prevailing uncertainties in this interaction may also creep into the bond energies calculated within this alternative method .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the binding energies and the bond energies of the light to heavy double-@xmath0 hypernuclei within a skyrme - hartree - fock model .",
    "this is an extension of the model used earlier to describe successfully the binding energies of the @xmath0 single particle states of both lighter as well as heavier single-@xmath0 hypernuclei@xcite . for the @xmath2 interaction",
    "the parameter set sly4 of ref.@xcite has been used while for the @xmath3 force the parameter set hp@xmath02 of ref.@xcite has been employed .",
    "these sets provide a reasonable overall description of the single-@xmath0 hypernuclear data . for the @xmath1 force ,",
    "parameter sets s@xmath83 , s@xmath84 and s@xmath85 of ref.@xcite as well as s@xmath86 and s@xmath87 of ref.@xcite were used . since in this work",
    "our aim has been more to establish our shf model for the description of the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei , we selected the @xmath1 force parameters that are already available in the literature . in future",
    ", efforts will be made to determine corresponding force parameters by refitting the data using our @xmath2 and @xmath3 interactions .",
    "nevertheless , even such a force will not be free from uncertainties .",
    "we have calculated the binding energies of a number of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei where some experimental information is available .",
    "we showed that shf calculations done with empirical skyrme type @xmath1 forces without the density dependent terms , provide a reasonable description of the @xmath1 hypernuclear systems .",
    "our results for the two-@xmath0 binding energies of the hypernuclear systems @xmath88be , @xmath89be , and @xmath21b are comparable to those obtained within other approaches such as the shell model , the cluster model and the quark mean - field model .",
    "however , in the present calculation it has not been possible to reproduce simultaneously the experimental binding energies of all the known double-@xmath0 hypernuclei with any one set of the @xmath1 potential .",
    "further studies are required to obtain more precise information about this force as compared to what is available now .",
    "we have also studied the @xmath71 dependence of the @xmath1 bond energy in the ground state of the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "we observe that the currently available limited experimental data for such hypernuclei do not allow to distinguish between the @xmath1 forces used in this study .",
    "however , they show a significant selectivity for the @xmath3 force where the set hp@xmath02 is favored .",
    "we acknowledge that the @xmath1 forces used by us are too simple .",
    "moreover , we have not considered the core polarization effects , which depend on the @xmath3 interaction@xcite .",
    "however , calculations made with more realistic @xmath1 potentials in ref.@xcite arrive at similar conclusions . at the present stage of our knowledge on hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions",
    "any fine tuning of these forces would clearly be premature .",
    "a systematic study of the data over a large mass range - as is done in the present paper , is necessary for deriving constraints on various interactions and density functionals .",
    "more experimental information on the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei over a wide mass range is , therefore , clearly required .",
    "the mean field method , on the other hand , may come to its limit for very light nuclei , but experience with shf calculations on nonstrange nuclei do not show dramatic failures of the method for such systems .",
    "rather they are surprisingly successful even in mass-4 region .",
    "thus this method is quite robust .",
    "our work demonstrates that the skyrme - hartree - fock model can be used as a workable theoretical framework for investigating the properties of both single- and double-@xmath0 hypernuclei over a wide mass region .",
    "one of the authors ( ng ) would like to thank the theory division of the saha institute of nuclear physics for the kind hospitality during her several visits there .",
