    "edwin @xcite is generally credited for the discovery of the expansion of the universe .",
    "but as so often in the case of fundamental discoveries , others had contributed .",
    "g.  lemaitre had published a value of the expansion rate ( hubble constant , @xmath8 ) already in @xcite , and h.  p.  robertson once laconically told sandage , hubble found the expansion because i told him .",
    "in fact , robertson had published his value of @xmath8 already in @xcite .",
    "hubbles most astounding achievement is to have convinced the world of the expansion of the universe with his brilliant monograph _ the realm of the nebulae _",
    "@xcite ; he had by then much better cards than in 1929 because he had extended with the help of milton humason the @xmath9 redshift - apparent magnitude diagram ( hubble diagram ) to @xmath10 @xcite , but his value of @xmath8 was still to high by a factor of roughly 8 , and correspondingly his expansion age was impossibly short  a problem which he elegantly managed to bypass .",
    "paradoxically @xcite began to question the reality of the expansion in the same year as his book appeared because he could not make sense of his galaxy counts .",
    "his doubts persisted until his death as evidenced in his darwin lecture ",
    "posthumously edited by sandage  where @xcite showed a hubble diagram including @xcite large - redshift clusters out @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] ) with the remark ` no recession factor ( applied ) ' , which means that he had corrected the galaxy magnitudes for a single factor of @xmath12 , but not for the @xmath13-term required in any expanding model .    a definitive description of the expansion had to proceed along two lines .",
    "( 1 ) the expansion field had to be mapped in different directions and out to truly cosmic distances  allowing for deceleration and/or acceleration  to test whether the expansion is linear , which means that it is observed as the same by any observer in the universe .",
    "\\(2 ) only then it is meaningful to search for the cosmic value of @xmath8 , which in turn would provide the first cosmological test , i.e.  the expansion age of the universe as compared with independent geological and astrophysical age determinations .",
    "sandage has contributed to these two topics more than anybody else , although only about one fourth of his papers are devoted to them .",
    "the remaining possibility that redshifts are _ not _ caused by the cosmic expansion has been disproved later by @xcite in a series of papers on the difficult tolman test ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) which requires that the surface brightness of a galaxy within a _ metric _ radius decreases with @xmath14 .",
    "the famous @xcite paper gave new support for an isotropic , expanding universe .",
    "m.  humason and n.  mayall published in it the 630 galaxy redshifts of the combined mount wilson and lick observatory sample .",
    "the task of the theoretical analysis of the data fell upon sandage .",
    "he homogenized the magnitudes , applied the first correct redshift - dependent k - corrections , and he showed hubble diagrams for various subsamples .",
    "in particular he derived the hubble diagram of 18 first - ranked cluster galaxies , where he applied corrections for luminosity evolution and the @xmath15-correction . from the upwards curvature of the hubble line he concluded that the expansion is decelerated . in a subsequent paper @xcite defined the deceleration parameter @xmath16 and derived a value of @xmath17 , i.e.  a decelerating universe .",
    "it is interesting that this value flatly disagrees with @xmath18 , the value required by hoyle s steady state model which he still maintained for a long time .",
    "the @xcite paper was the strongest support for an expanding universe until 1962 , when the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) was detected ( fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] ) .    in @xcite sandage wrote a paper _ the ability of the 200-inch telescope to discriminate between selected world models_. it became the foundation of modern observational cosmology and made cosmology a quantitative science .",
    "he calculated the form of the hubble diagram , the number of galaxies per apparent magnitude bin , and the diameter - redshift relation for a grid of different values of @xmath16 , including @xmath19 .",
    "the large redshifts of quasars were discovered in 1963 .",
    "sandage s rle in the discovery is well by @xcite .",
    "sandage also discovered the radio - quiet qss @xcite .",
    "the discovery prompted widespread speculations about large non - cosmological redshifts .",
    "sandage was appalled . at the iau general assembly in prague in 1966 sandage , together with sir martin ryle , was the main speaker on the nature of large redshifts .",
    "he gave a flamboyant presentation , but some remained still unconvinced .",
    "sandage felt an enormous pressure for the coming years , and he developed painful arthritis in his fingers , that later became dormant ( fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] ) .      during that time",
    "sandage decided that the hubble diagram of brightest cluster galaxies had to be carried to higher redshifts with the double purpose of determining @xmath16 and to see how quasars , radio galaxies , and n and seyfert galaxies fitted into the picture .",
    "he single - handedly mounted a gigantic observing program for the identification , position , apparent magnitude and redshift of distant brightest cluster galaxies down to the limit of the 200-inch telescope .",
    "precise positions were needed because the fainter objects could not be seen by eye , and the aperture photometry and photographic spectroscopy had to be done by blind offsets .",
    "he sometimes spent 14 hours without interruption in the narrow prime focus of the telescope , and he frequently changed , depending on the seeing conditions , the very heavy instruments during the night , which impaired his health . in total",
    "he invested more than 100 nights of the `` big eye '' on the program , that resulted in eight papers leaving no doubt that in order to explain the scatter in the hubble diagram of various objects it was _ not _ necessary to invoke mysterious redshift , but that it was caused by the respective luminosity functions .",
    "by @xcite he had extended the hubble diagram with a dispersion of @xmath20 to @xmath21 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:04 ] .",
    "a formal solution for @xmath16 gave @xmath22 , yet excluding luminosity evolution .",
    "at the arrival of ccd detectors @xcite extended the hubble diagram to @xmath23 , but without quoting a value of @xmath16 , because in the mean time it had become clear that the light of e galaxies is dominated by red giants @xcite and that luminosity evolution has a decisive effect .",
    "early hubble diagrams of snei showed promise that they may become useful as standard candles , but the dispersion was still large @xcite nevertheless a scatter of less than @xmath24 was suggested in a paper by @xcite .",
    "the situation improved further with the spectroscopic separation of type ia sne from other subtypes @xcite .",
    "this led to a luminosity dispersion of @xmath25 @xcite which made sneia strong competitors to brightest cluster galaxies as standard candles , in particular as they are presumably little affected by luminosity evolution .",
    "their study was followed up by many authors , too numerous to be cited here , who increased the sample and improved the data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the suggestion of @xcite that the snia luminosity depended on the decline rate was initially questioned by @xcite , but later fully confirmed on the basis of more distant sneia with reliable velocity distances in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of the maximum magnitude was now reduced to @xmath26 , or even less for the @xmath27 magnitudes in dust - free e / s0 galaxies .",
    "( for the definition of the corrected maximum magnitudes see   [ sec:3:3 ] ) .",
    "the last paper in that series ( * ? ? ? * in the following srt10 ) contains 246 sneia with @xmath28 ( for the corrected velocities see   [ sec:2:7 ] ) .",
    "the sample is a compilation of @xmath29 and @xmath30 data from five large , overlapping sets of sneia ( cited in @xcite ) which were homogenized by requiring that each set has to comply on average with the same , arbitrarily chosen value of @xmath31 .",
    "the resulting hubble diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig:05 ] below ) carries sandage s expectation of a linearly expanding universe down to scales of @xmath32 .",
    "others have carried the sneia hubble diagram to much higher redshifts and have thereby discovered dark energy @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sneia good relative distances of 28 clusters with @xmath33 have become available from the mean 21cm - line width distances of about 25 individual cluster members per cluster @xcite .",
    "their hubble line has a scatter of only @xmath34 and shows no deviations from linear expansion ; the line was fitted onto the line of sneia by a shift in apparent modulus .",
    "they are included in figure  [ fig:05 ] .",
    "also fitted onto the hubble line are 11 clusters with good relative fundamental - plane ( fp ) distances from @xcite .",
    "@xcite traced the hubble diagram also to lower velocities , using mainly cepheid distances ; the aim was to detect the perturbation of the local group on the local expansion field .",
    "later , a sample of 29 cepheids with a minimum distance of @xmath35mpc was formed from the list of @xcite including a few additions .",
    "this sample , shown in figure  [ fig:05 ] after normalization to the fiducial value of @xmath31 , defines a hubble diagram with a dispersion of @xmath36 , much of which is caused by random velocities .",
    "an orthogonal fit to the data , assuming equal errors in magnitude and velocity , gives a slope of @xmath37 , i.e.  fully consistent with 0.2 for an isotropic universe and @xmath38 .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath39 of the trgb has emerged as a powerful distance indicator , but , hardly reaching the virgo cluster , its range is still limited  even more so than that of cepheids .",
    "but locally the apparent trgb magnitudes @xmath40 are ideal to trace the _ mean _ hubble line because their large number compensates for the large scatter in @xmath29 caused by the random velocities of nearby field galaxies .",
    "@xmath40 magnitudes of 176 galaxies have been compiled ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in the following tsr08a ) of which the nearer ones may be affected by the perturbation of the local group .",
    "the hubble line with only the 78 more distant ones with @xmath41 has a slope of @xmath42 in agreement with linear expansion .",
    "the sample of 176 trgb is shown in figure  [ fig:05 ] , adjusted to the fiducial value of @xmath31 .",
    "for the nearby cepheid and trgb distances it is important to note that all distances in figure  [ fig:05 ] refer to the barycenter of the local group assumed to lie at two thirds of the way toward m31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hubble diagrams of sneia ( including 35 clusters ) , of the cepheid distances , and of the trgb magnitudes have been combined in a single diagram in figure  [ fig:05 ] on the assumption that they comply to a common value of @xmath8 .",
    "the question is to what extent the assumption is justified .",
    "the intercept of the hubble line of the sneia has an error of @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding error of the cepheid hubble line is 0.012 .",
    "hence the two partially overlapping hubble lines can be connected within an error of @xmath44 or @xmath45 . ",
    "the 78 trgb galaxies outside @xmath35mpc determine the intercept within @xmath46 ; merging them with the sneia and cepheid data causes hence an additional error of @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "the combined fitting error between the nearest and the most distant objects is therefore @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "this limits the variation of @xmath8 with distance to about @xmath51 .",
    "this value is now independent of any a priori assumption on @xmath8 .",
    "additional evidence for the near constancy of @xmath8 over the entire distance range comes from table  [ tab:01 ] below , where the value of @xmath8 of the distant sneia is given as well as the _ independent _ value of the nearby trgb distances , including their statistical errors . from this",
    "follows a difference of @xmath8 of only @xmath52 .",
    "the conclusion is that the cosmic value of @xmath8 is the same as the mean local value at @xmath53 to within @xmath54 .",
    "the linearity of the expansion allows to test the results of various distance indicators which  beyond @xmath55  must yield mean values of @xmath8 that are independent of distance .",
    "examples are : the distances from surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) collected in @xcite and the luminosity function of planetary nebulae ( pnlf ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig:06 ] they suggest that @xmath8 increases beyond @xmath56 by more than 25% which is impossible in the light of figure  [ fig:05 ] .",
    "however , new work on the sbf method is promising ; in any case the fornax cluster modulus of @xmath57 @xcite is in good agreement with sandage s value of @xmath58 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a large sample of relative d@xmath59 distances of early - type galaxies out to @xmath60 has been published by @xcite .",
    "the sample is not complete in any sense and yields a hubble diagram with a scatter of @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding incompleteness bias causes a seeming , but spurious increase of @xmath8 with distance .",
    "the authors have therefore applied a bias correction which causes @xmath8 to _ decrease _ by 10% out to the catalog limit , which suggests that the sample was somewhat overcorrected ( @xcite , fig .",
    " a much smaller sample of related fp distances is apparently bias - free ; it has been used in   [ sec:2:2 ] .",
    "21 cm line width distances ( tully - fisher relation ) of inclined spiral galaxies have been determined by numerous authors .",
    "the crux of the method is its large intrinsic scatter of @xmath62 , that is partially due to the difficult corrections for inclination and internal absorption .",
    "( the apparent scatter of _",
    "magnitude_-limited samples is of course smaller . )",
    "distance determinations of field galaxies by some authors are therefore affected by incompleteness bias .",
    "an attempt to correct 21 cm line distances for bias does not prove , but is consistent with linear expansion @xcite . a complete , distance - limited and therefore bias - free sample of 104 inclined field spirals can be defined out to only @xmath63 ( @xcite ) ; its large scatter does not allow to test for linearity .",
    "useful , however , are the nearly complete spiral samples of the virgo and uma clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the valuable cluster distances derived from many 21 cm line width data of a incomplete , but carefully bias - corrected sample of spiral members @xcite are mentioned already in   [ sec:2:2 ] .",
    "the first models of the velocity perturbations caused by the nearby virgo cluster are due to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "sandage and some of his collaborators authored several papers on the subject ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "their value of the virgocentric infall vector of the local group of @xmath0 @xcite encompasses most subsequent determinations .",
    "the value has been used to correct all velocities for a self - consistent virgocentric infall model , which assumes a virgo density profile of @xmath64 and , correspondingly , that the infall of individual galaxies scales with @xmath65 .",
    "an equation for the corrected velocities @xmath66 is given in @xcite .",
    "the observed velocity of the local group toward the cmb apex is the vector sum of the virgocentric infall and of a still larger velocity comprising a volume of unknown size . taking the observed cmb velocity of @xmath67 @xcite toward an apex @xmath68 at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , reducing it to the barycenter of the local group , and subtracting the virgocentric infall one finds @xmath71 towards the apex @xmath72 at @xmath73 , @xmath74 . in order to determine the size of the co - moving volume a hubble diagram was constructed as in fig .",
    "[ fig:05 ] , but now using the @xmath66 velocities as ordinate . the residuals @xmath75 from the resulting hubble line were plotted versus @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the angle between the object and @xmath72 .",
    "after several trials the plot was divided into objects with @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:07]a ) and into objects with @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:07]b ) .",
    "the residuals of the nearer objects show essentially no dependence on @xmath76 .",
    "this means that they are at rest in first approximation relative to the virgo cluster , once the virgocentric velocities and the regular hubble flow are subtracted .",
    "the inner volume emerges as the ( truly contracting ) local supercluster ( fig .  [ fig:08 ] ) .",
    "the objects with @xmath80 show a highly significant dependence on @xmath76 .",
    "this reflects a bulk motion of the local supercluster of @xmath81 in good agreement with the expected cmb value of @xmath82 .",
    "most of the bulk motion must therefore be caused by the gravitational force , integrated over the whole sky , from the irregularly distributed masses between 3500 and @xmath83 ( @xcite ) .",
    "all velocities in this paper are corrected for virgocentric infall and  in case of @xmath80  for the adopted velocity of @xmath84 of the local supercluster toward the cmb apex @xmath72 .",
    "hubble had based his galaxy distances on a few cepheids , on brightest stars , and on the mean luminosity of galaxies .",
    "his result was @xmath85 .",
    "improvements of this value came slowly ( for reviews see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in @xcite baade defined @xmath8 as one of the prime targets for the new @xmath86 telescope .",
    "but his seminal distinction between the young population i and the old population ii @xcite was still based on observations with the @xmath87 telescope .",
    "the new finding , that revealed the luminosity difference between rr  lyr stars and cepheids , was confirmed by sandage s thesis work @xcite and reduced @xmath8 by a factor of 2",
    ".      in @xcite sandage summarized the results from the first four years with the @xmath86 telescope and concluded , mainly from a corrected magnitude scale , that @xmath88 [ @xmath89mpc@xmath90 .",
    "he also found that some of hubble s brightest stars are actually hii regions which are 2 magnitudes brighter ; this and a new cepheid distance of m31 @xcite led to @xmath91 ( @xcite ) . in @xcite sandage gave a review of @xmath8 at the influential santa barbara colloquium where he gave @xmath92 as the mean of several authors , but his preferred value , considering also the size of hii regions , was @xmath93 .    his well - known paper of @xcite _ the search for two numbers _ ( @xmath8 and @xmath16 ) started a new attack on @xmath8 .",
    "it had begun already with the cepheid distance of ngc2403 @xcite , the first galaxy outside the local group , and continued with a series of _ steps toward the hubble constant _ which used @xcite luminosity classes of spirals in addition to the previous distance indicators .",
    "the result was @xmath94 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this prompted a 10-year controversy with g.  de  vaucouleurs ( @xcite , and references therein ) who had embraced a value of @xmath95 .",
    "subsequent papers of the series used also 21 cm line widths and the luminosity function of globular clusters giving , if anything , somewhat lower values @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived from the old method of the luminosity classification of spirals a value of 42 which amused him because of the coincidence with `` the answer to the ultimate question '' in douglas adams s fiction _ the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy_.    after a pilot program to calibrate the luminosity of sneia with brightest stars @xcite , sandage formed a small team to observe with _ hst _ the cepheids in galaxies with known sneia . previous attempts of a snia calibration depended mainly on an adopted virgo cluster distance ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which itself is controversial .",
    "the program required  as described in the next three sections  a re - evaluation of cepheids as distance indicators , the luminosity calibration of sneia , and the zero - point determination of the trgb distances as an independent test .",
    "sandage wrote about 50 papers on cepheids .",
    "already the first paper @xcite brought a new physical understanding of the period - luminosity ( p - l ) relation of cepheids which he derived from the theory of harmonic oscillations .",
    "he showed that the p - l relation must have intrinsic scatter , and that the relation is actually a period - luminosity - color relation .",
    "a new p - l relation was constructed by superimposing the cepheids of several external galaxies and by setting the zero point by means of up to 11 cepheids that are members of galactic clusters with known distances @xcite .",
    "a basic observational fact is that the colors of cepheids depend on metallicity .",
    "this was first set out for the galaxy and smc by @xcite and explained by @xcite not so much as a line blanketing effect , but as a temperature effect .",
    "the metallicity effect between galactic , lmc , and smc cepheids becomes striking in their @xmath96 versus @xmath97 diagrams ( * ? ? ?",
    "7a&b , in the following tsr03 ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of model atmospheres reveals that the whole instability strip is shifted in the hr diagram by variations of the metal content @xcite . if the ensuing period - color ( p - c ) relations are different then the pulsation equation requires that also the p - l relations must necessarily be metal - dependent @xcite .",
    "metal - specific p - c and p - l relations are therefore needed .    only for three galaxies the necessary input data , i.e.  intrinsic color and distance , are available : the galaxy with [ o / h]@xmath98 , lmc with [ o / h]@xmath99 , and smc with [ o / h]@xmath100 .",
    "the galactic cepheid colors are well determined ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; those in lmc and smc have been derived in fields surrounding the cepheids and independently of the cepheids themselves @xcite .",
    "the distances of lmc [ @xmath101 and smc [ @xmath102 are known to better than @xmath103 from a number of distance indicators that are independent of any assumption on the p - l relation of cepheids ( @xcite , table  6 & 7 ) .",
    "the galactic p - l relation relies on 33 cepheids in galactic clusters and associations and on 36 cepheids with baade - becker - wesselink distances ; for the individual sources see @xcite .",
    "the two methods have been criticized by @xcite , and the bbw method is blemished by the uncertain projection factor @xmath104 @xcite . yet",
    "the steep slopes of the galactic p - l relation from the independent cluster cepheids and the bbw method @xcite agree exceedingly well , and the steep slope is also observed in the metal - rich galaxies ngc3351 and 4321 ( @xcite ) .    the finally adopted , only slightly revised p - c und p - l relations of the three calibrating galaxies are spelled out in sandage s last paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relations of lmc and smc with their conspicuous breaks at @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively , are compared here with the galactic ones in figure  [ fig:09 ] .",
    "cepheids in five galaxies of very low metallicity like smc , or even lower , yield particularly well to the application of the smc p - c and p - l relations .",
    "the resulting distances agree with rr  lyr star and trgb moduli to within @xmath107 on average .",
    "this provides an interesting comparison of the independent distance scales of the young population i and old population ii .",
    "it has been proposed to use so - called wesenheit pseudo - magnitudes @xmath108 in order to deal with the problem of internal absorption .",
    "they are defined as @xmath109 or @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the absorption - to - reddening ratio .",
    "_ intrinsic _ color differences of cepheids with different metallicity are treated here ",
    "after multiplication with @xmath111 !  as an absorption effect .",
    "this leads of course to systematic distance errors .",
    "the crux of cepheid distances is that the internal absorption must be known which necessitates a priori assumptions about their ( metal - dependent ! ) colors .",
    "three problematic cases are mentioned in the following .",
    "+ * m101 . * the 28 cepheids in an outer metal - poor field of m101",

    "the absorption - corrected p - l relation , however , is significantly flatter than the galactic p - l relation , but agrees well  in spite of higher metallicity  with the one of lmc .",
    "if the latter is adopted the modulus becomes @xmath115 . both of the two discrepant distance determinations are internally consistent inasmuch as either fulfills the important test that the _ individual _ cepheid distances must not depend on the period .",
    "it seems to follow that the inner , metal - rich cepheids are more luminous than assumed , or that the metal - poor , outer cepheids are bluer and consequentially more absorbed than assumed . + * ngc 4258 .",

    "have shown that the inner field is almost as metal - poor as the outer field .",
    "the cepheids in both fields should therefore be reduced with the p - c and p - l relations of lmc .",
    "one obtains then for the outer field @xmath116 and @xmath117 and for the inner field @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the modulus discrepancy of @xmath20 is worrisome .",
    "the cepheids in the two fields , although of similar metallicity , do not seem to follow identical p - c and/or p - l relations .",
    "it has been proposed to use ngc4258 as a cornerstone for the distance scale because of its water maser distance of @xmath120 @xcite and in spite of its remaining error .",
    "however , for other cepheids , even if metal - poor , it is not clear whether they should be compared with the cepheids in the outer or inner field .",

    "the cepheids constitute a new class . without knowledge of their true p - c and p - l relations",
    "it is of course not possible to determine their distances .",
    "the case is alarming because also the cepheids of ngc3021 @xcite appear to be too blue by @xmath121 , and additional intrinsically blue cepheids may appear red because of reddening in their parent galaxies .",
    "these examples and particularly the ultra - blue cepheids in ngc1309 suggest that an additional , hidden parameter influences the properties of cepheids .",
    "it has been discussed in the literature whether the helium content could be the culprit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the 62 sneia , corrected for galactic and internal absorption and normalized to @xmath130 , in the well populated range of the hubble diagram between 3000 and @xmath134 have mean absolute magnitudes of @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 as judged from their velocity distances assuming @xmath31 .",
    "the statistical error of the mean absolute magnitudes is only @xmath138 .",
    "the _ hst _ supernova project @xcite gives for ten sneia with metallicity - corrected cepheid distances weighted luminosities of @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 in the system of @xcite .",
    "these values compared with those in the previous paragraph yield a mean value of @xmath142 .",
    "the statistical error depends almost entirely on the calibration and not on the definition of the hubble line .",
    "correspondingly the systematic error of @xmath143 ( estimated ) is dominated by errors of the cepheid distances .    to emphasize the difference between the sn magnitudes as defined here and those used by other authors it is noted that",
    ", for instance , the apparent sn magnitudes as reduced by @xcite are fainter by @xmath144 on average than here .",
    "this is purely the result of the definition of the corrected value of @xmath145 .",
    "the fascinating property of the trgb is that its calibration is straightforward and that the maximum brightness of red giants is limited by basic physics . particularly stable",
    "is the near - infrared maximum magnitude @xmath146 of red giants in old , metal - poor halo populations @xcite , where also internal absorption poses a minimum problem .",
    "the practical difficulty is the observational determination of the upper limit @xmath146 , which requires a sufficiently large sample _ and _ the separation of agb stars . for the history and model calculations of the trgb see @xcite .",
    "the obvious way to calibrate the trgb is by rr  lyr stars .",
    "sandage has devoted 50 papers to these stars , exploring their classification , metal content , evolution , age etc .",
    "his last metal - dependent , non - linear luminosity calibration is @xmath147 } + 0.140\\mbox{[fe / h]}^{2}$ ] , i.e. @xmath148 at [ fe / h]@xmath149 @xcite .",
    "this calibration has been applied to 24 galaxies for which rr  lyr magnitudes are available in the literature as well as trgb magnitudes @xmath146 ( for the many original sources see @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of the rr  lyr moduli with the corresponding apparent @xmath146 magnitudes yields the absolute magnitudes @xmath150 .",
    "the mean magnitude of the sample  with a mean color of @xmath151 or [ fe / h]@xmath149 and omitting two deviating cases  is @xmath152 , where the dispersion is @xmath50 ( @xcite ) .",
    "exactly the same value has been found by @xcite from globular cluster distances , and by @xcite from fitting the horizontal branch ( hb ) of five galaxies to a metal - corrected hb with a known trigonometric parallax .",
    "also the model luminosities of @xcite and @xcite are close to the empirical calibration .",
    "the question to what extent @xmath150 depends on the metallicity has repeatedly been discussed in the literature .",
    "most authors agree that the luminosity does not change by more than @xmath48 over the relevant range of @xmath153 or @xmath154}<-1.2 $ ] ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the adopted trgb moduli of 17 galaxies , for which also cepheid moduli are available ( listed in @xcite ) , reveal that they are larger by a marginal amount of @xmath155 , than the cepheid moduli .",
    "this shows that sandage s trgb and cepheid distances , although fully independent , are in satisfactory agreement .",
    "the dispersion of the differences of @xmath156 suggests that the individual trgb and cepheid distances carry random errors of less than @xmath157 .",
    "the mean @xmath150 magnitudes of 240 galaxies of the many values in the literature have been averaged and normalized to the above calibration .",
    "the resulting distances are listed in @xcite .",
    "the subsample of 78 galaxies more distant than @xmath158mpc gives @xmath159 .    in the future",
    "it will be important to extend the range of trgb distances beyond @xmath160 in order to tie them even tighter to the cosmic expansion field and/or to provide an independent luminosity calibration of sneia .",
    "first attempts have been made ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "lrrcc trgb & 350 & 78 & @xmath161 & 1 + 21 cm line width & 750 & 104 & @xmath162 & 2 + cepheids & 900 & 29 & @xmath163 & 1 + sneia ( @xmath164 ) & 1350 & 20 & @xmath165 & 2 + sneia ( @xmath166 ) & 7700 & 62 & @xmath167 & 3 + adopted & & & +      sandage has persued the calibration of @xmath8 for almost 60 years .",
    "it was his aim from the beginning to base his distance scale on two independent pillars , i.e.  on population  i and population  ii objects , and he spent about equal efforts on either route .",
    "the distance scale of the former depends heavily on cepheids , whereas that of the population  ii relies mainly on rr  lyr stars .",
    "the determination of cepheid distances has become more involved because of the metal dependence of the p - c and p - l relations , accentuated by the corresponding problems of internal absorption and other unexplained effects  in particular of the more metal - rich cepheids ( see   [ sec:3:2:2 ] ) . hence the need for a second pillar",
    "has become even more urgent .",
    "the direct comparison of cepheids and rr  lyr stars is unprofitable because of the paucity of galaxies with reliable data on both distance indicators .",
    "but here the rr lyr - calibrated trgb distances jump in , which offer ample comparison with cepheid distances ( @xcite , tab",
    "more important yet was for him that the  admittedly still local  value of @xmath8 from the trgb is the same within the statistical errors as that from cepheids and cepheid - calibrated 21 cm distances and sneia as summarized in table  [ tab:01 ] .",
    "some months before sandage s death @xcite published a paper combining the catalog of luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) from the sloan digital sky survey dr7 with the 5-year wmap data and the hubble diagram of the sneia union sample to find a value of @xmath168 on the assumption of a @xmath169cdm model .    a personal note of gat : i think of allan sandage in deep thankfulness .",
    "he was my inspiring mentor , he shared his love for astronomy with me , he impressed me with his broad culture , and beyond this he was a friend of profound honesty .",
