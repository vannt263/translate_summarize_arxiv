    "dust particles of nanometric size have been detected in situ in various parts of the solar system , e.g. near comets @xcite , in the earth low ionosphere ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , in the solar wind near 1 au @xcite , in streams ejected by jupiter @xcite and saturn @xcite , in the atmosphere of saturn s moon titan @xcite , and in the plume ejected by the icy moon enceladus @xcite .",
    "nanograins , which make the transition between molecules and bulk materials , can be produced by condensation of gases and aggregation of molecules @xcite , and/or by fragmentation of larger dust ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the large surface - to - volume ratio of nanoparticles makes the proportion of surface atoms significant , so that their characteristic properties often differ from those of bulk materials and they are major agents for interactions with particles and fields .",
    "nanograins play an important role in magnetized environments because their interaction with electromagnetic fields varies in proportion of their electric charge , which varies more slowly with size than do the friction forces ( proportional to surface ) and the gravitational forces ( proportional to volume ) .",
    "hence nanograins are generally driven by electromagnetic forces as are plasma particles , so that their electric charge governs their dynamics ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the electric charge can also determine the grain s minimum size via the electrostatic stresses producing fracture , and it also affects the grains growth and coalescence . at larger scales , it determines the larmor frequency and thus the time scale of grains pick - up .    at nanometric sizes ,",
    "several effects make the charging processes different from the classical charging of larger objects .",
    "first , it is well known that the particle sticking coefficients and photoelectric and secondary emission yields can change @xcite , essentially because the electron free path in matter is of the order of ( or larger than ) 1 nm below @xmath0 ev @xcite .",
    "two further effects appear when the grain radius becomes comparable to @xmath1 in a plasma of temperature @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath3 , this concerns nanograins in plasmas of temperature @xmath4 ev .",
    "this scale , often called the landau radius , is the distance below which the mutual electrostatic energy of two approaching charged particles exceeds the kinetic energy of their relative motion , so that they significantly perturb each other s trajectories .",
    "this fundamental scale , which determines the plasma particle cross - sections for coulomb collisions producing large perturbations , is also of major importance for dust grains .",
    "indeed , the particles approaching a grain of radius @xmath5 or smaller induce polarization charges whose coulomb attraction increases the collected fluxes , thereby decreasing the charging time scales .",
    "furthermore , since at this scale the charging becomes discretized , the equilibrium charge on a grain no longer varies in proportion of its size , but becomes comparable to one electron charge in a wide range of sizes , because the probability that an uncharged grain collects an electron exceeds the probability that a neutral or negatively charged grain collects an ion .",
    "the latter phenomena have been studied in the contexts of the earth s ionosphere ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and of the interstellar medium ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper , we consider these effects for cold dense planetary environments in the outer solar system , which are subjected to different constraints .",
    "we derive analytical results that can be used in these contexts , and apply them to the nanograins detected in enceladus plume @xcite , where the electrons are cold enough @xcite to put the landau radius in the nano range , the plasma is dense enough @xcite for the photoelectron emission to be negligible , and the ( larger ) dust concentration is high enough to deplete the electrons by a large amount .",
    "these calculations will enable us to estimate the grains size limit set by electrostatic disruption and to compare it with other physical processes .",
    "units are si , unless otherwise indicated explicitly .",
    "before considering nanograins , let us briefly summarize the classical electric charging by collection and emission of particles for a dust grain of radius @xmath6 in a plasma whose electron and ion densities may be different because of the possible presence of dust .",
    "the charging of a grain changes its electric potential , which changes the particle fluxes until an equilibrium is reached when the different charge fluxes balance each other .",
    "the electron flux tends to exceed that of ions because of the faster electron speeds ( except in the case of strong electron depletion discussed in sect .",
    "[ dusty ] ) ; hence , when the charging is mainly due to electron and ion impacts , the body charges negatively until it repels sufficiently the electrons for their flux to balance that of positive ions . for",
    "this to be so , the electron potential energy at the body s surface @xmath7 must exceed sufficiently ( but not too much ) the particle thermal energy @xmath8 .",
    "thus the equilibrium grains potential with respect to the ambient plasma is @xmath9 , with @xmath10 of order of magnitude unity . for a sphere of radius @xmath11 much smaller than both the debye length @xmath12 and the grains separation , the electric charge is @xmath13 . substituting the above value of @xmath14 yields the number of charge units @xmath15 at equilibrium @xmath16 with @xmath17 in order of magnitude .",
    "the mean number of a grain s charges thus exceeds unity when @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 is easily calculated since in that case the particles are subjected to the coulomb potential of the grain without intervening barriers of potential ( the so - called orbit - limited condition @xcite ) . when the plasma particles are singly charged and have isotropic maxwellian velocity distributions , the classical fluxes of each particle species",
    "can then be expressed straightforwardly as @xmath19 per unit grain s surface , where @xmath20 is the landau radius corresponding to the temperature of the species considered and @xmath21 is the flux of that species on an uncharged grain @xmath22 here @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath2 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the sticking probability , number density , temperature , mass , and mean speed of the species concerned in the unperturbed plasma . for ions of mass @xmath27 and same temperature @xmath2 as electrons of mass @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 at equilibrium , the electron and ion fluxes balance , and @xmath10 is the solution of the equation @xmath30    \\label{zeq}\\ ] ]    this confirms that @xmath10 is of order of magnitude unity , except if @xmath31 - a case that we will discuss later . note that we have not assumed @xmath32 , in order for the results to be applicable in dusty environments .",
    "therefore , although @xmath33 because of the large ion - to - electron mass ratio , we have not necessarily @xmath34 , but only the weaker inequality @xmath35 ( as will be shown in sect .  [ dusty ] ) .    for nanograins in a low - energy plasma , the sticking probability of ions @xmath36 1 , but the sticking probability of electrons may be smaller because the free path of electrons in solids ( which decreases as energy decreases at energies exceeding a few 100 ev ) reaches a minimum generally smaller than 1 nm in the vicinity of tens ev , and increases as energy decreases again to values comparable to or greater than 1 nm around 1 ev , taking into account elastic and inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "a conservative assumption is @xmath37 @xcite for nanograins , keeping in mind that @xmath38 may be much smaller as the number of atoms decreases @xcite , essentially because the limited number of degrees of freedom precludes the conservation of energy and momentum in the collision .    for water - group incident ions",
    "@xmath39 @xmath40 , so that eq.([zeq ] ) yields @xmath41 0.31 , 1.85 , or 3.65 for respectively @xmath42 , 0.1 , or 1 .",
    "the above estimates assume that photoemission ( including photodetachment ) and secondary emission are negligible .",
    "the photoelectron emission on uncharged grains at heliospheric distance @xmath43 ( in astronomical units ) can be approximated by @xcite @xmath44 per unit of the total grain s surface area @xmath45 - to facilitate comparison with other fluxes ( we have taken into account that the projected sunlit area is one - quarter of the grain s surface area ) .",
    "the smaller value of @xmath46 corresponds for example to materials such as graphite or ice , the larger to silicates .",
    "for nanograins @xmath47 may be different for two main reasons which act in opposite senses .",
    "first , since the photon attenuation length generally exceeds the photoelectron escape length by a large amount , a small grain size limits the distance from the excitation region to the surface , which tends to increase the yield compared to that of bulk materials @xcite .",
    "second , the photon absorption cross - section ( normalized to the cross - sectional area ) at the relevant wave lengths @xmath48 m varies roughly as @xmath49 when this size parameter is much smaller than unity ; this is expected to decrease @xmath46 significantly .",
    "because of the large uncertainties in these properties , we will use the conservative assumption @xmath50 for silicate and water ice nanograins . from ( [ nph0 ] ) , we deduce the ratio between photoelectron emission and ion ( of mass @xmath51 ) collection for uncharged grains at 10 au heliocentric distance ( @xmath52 saturn s orbit ) , @xmath53    photoelectron emission is thus expected to be of minor importance for water - group incident ions of density @xmath54 @xmath55 and temperature @xmath56 1 ev . likewise , `` true '' secondary electron emission is expected to be negligible , even for very small grains , for electron temperatures @xmath56 1 ev @xcite .",
    "the above calculations assume for simplicity that the particle velocity distributions are maxwellian .",
    "solar system plasmas are generally non - maxwellian , containing suprathermal particles with kappa - like distributions @xcite .",
    "this changes the fluxes @xcite and might have large consequences if the secondary electron emission were not negligible @xcite .",
    "the grain relative velocity has also been neglected , which is acceptable if it is smaller than the ion thermal speed .",
    "finally , let us discuss briefly how the plasma electron depletion @xmath57 is related to the charged dust .",
    "strictly speaking , the above calculations hold when the dust grains are isolated , thus when the grains number density @xmath58 is small enough that their separation exceeds twice the debye length , i.e. @xmath59 . with the grains charge ( [ z1 ] ) and the debye length @xmath60^{-1/2 } \\label{ld}\\ ] ]",
    "the ratio of the charge carried by the grains to that available in the medium is @xmath61 with @xmath62 since @xmath63 because the grains separation necessarily exceeds their diameter , we have @xmath64 if the grains separation exceeeds @xmath12 , so that in that case the grains charge is not expected to perturb significantly the plasma .     electron - to - ion number density @xmath57 ( left axis , solid line ) and normalized grain s charge @xmath65 ( right axis , dashed ) versus the parameter @xmath66 , from ( [ neni ] ) with @xmath67 ( water - group ions and electron sticking probability @xmath68 ) for dust grains of radius @xmath69 .",
    "the limits @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 are plotted for comparison ( thin lines).,width=415 ]    in the opposite case @xmath73 , the grains debye spheres overlap and the electrons are depleted since many of them rest on the grain s surface , which in turn reduces the grain s charge @xcite . however ,",
    "if the grain size is much smaller than the grains separation , the increase of the grain - to - plasma capacitance due to the neighbouring grains can be neglected and eqs.([nrep])-([natt ] ) still hold @xcite , with @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the grain - to - plasma potential . therefore ( [ zeq ] ) holds in that case and using the quasi - neutrality condition @xmath76 and rewriting ( [ ld ] ) as @xmath77 , one deduces straightforwardly @xmath78 from ( [ neni ] ) , one can deduce two of the three parameters @xmath57 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , from one of them .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows @xmath57 versus @xmath80 , which enables one to deduce the grains properties from the electron depletion or vice - versa . for completeness",
    "we have also plotted @xmath10 versus @xmath80 , first published by @xcite and reproduced in several papers .",
    "note that the pioneering results by @xcite and references therein use a different definition of @xmath80 , based on the plasma properties outside the dusty region - which is relevant for studying the local properties of a dust cloud ; both definitions agree in the limit of small potentials ( when the boltzmann factors can be linearized ) .    in the limit @xmath81 ,",
    "( [ neni ] ) yields @xmath82 which corresponds to the limit @xmath83 of eq.([zeq ] ) and shows that the electrons can not be more depleted with respect to ions than the limiting value @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "of course , when the grains have a continuous size distribution @xmath85 ( for @xmath86 ) , @xmath80 must be calculated by replacing in ( [ sigma ] ) @xmath87 by its mean value @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "in general the minimum @xmath89 is unknown , but dust analyzers can measure the number density @xmath90 of grains larger than some radius @xmath91 . in that case , one can derive @xmath89 from the measured value of @xmath57 without having to make a hypothesis on the grains potential .",
    "for example , with @xmath92 ( with @xmath93 ) so that the number density of grains larger than @xmath87 is @xmath94 , we substitute @xmath95 for @xmath87 in ( [ sigma ] ) and get @xmath96 which together with ( [ neni ] ) yields @xmath89 as a function of @xmath57 . this will be used in sect .",

    "the results of sect .  [ chargingimpacts ] hold for grains of size much larger than the landau radius ; how much larger will be determined later ( eq.([zap ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . for smaller grains ,",
    "the polarization charges induced on a grain by approaching charged particles produce an electric potential which perturbs significantly their trajectories , as first shown in the context of ion capture by aerosols in the earth s ionosphere @xcite ; hence the particle fluxes are modified .",
    "consider an ion or an electron ( charge @xmath97 ) approaching at distance @xmath98 from the centre of a spherical grain of radius @xmath99 and electric charge @xmath100 .",

    "in that case , the two terms in the potential ( [ phir ] ) are of opposite signs so that the potential has a maximum at the distance @xmath125 given by @xmath126 for @xmath127 and 2 , ( [ x0 ] ) yields @xmath128 and 1.42 respectively , whereas in the limit @xmath129 we have @xmath130 . at the maximum of the barrier of potential ,",

    "note that this estimate does not require the grain potential as an input since it is calculated in parallel , contrary to estimates using the measured spacecraft potential ( e.g. @xcite ) .    finally , according to eq.([zzz ] )",
    ", the electrons can not be more depleted than @xmath236 ( since @xmath237 ) , which agrees in order of magnitude with observation .",
    "finally , consider grains of radius smaller than about 1 nm . according to ( [ zmean1 ] ) , their charge should decrease below one charge unit when @xmath238 , whereas their charging time scale increases .",
    "this might possibly contribute to the decrease observed in the flux of charged grains below 1 nm @xcite .",
    "several other effects are expected to act at such small sizes .",
    "first , the high electric field @xmath239 at the grain s surface can make it explode if the electrostatic stress @xmath240 exceeds the maximum grain s tensile strength against fracture @xmath241 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the condition @xmath242 yields the limiting grain radius @xmath243 the maximum tensile strength @xmath241 of sub - nanometric ice grains is highly uncertain .",
    "since the tensile strength of macroscopic materials is determined in a large part by cracks and dislocations , @xmath241 is expected to exceed by a large amount the ( highly temperature dependent ) value of macroscopic ice @xmath244 nm@xmath245 @xcite , for sub - nanometric grains having a compact structure .    given these uncertainties and the weak dependence on @xmath241 of the size limit ( [ fracture ] ) , we make below a tentative order - of - magnitude estimate .",
    "with the bonding strength energy @xmath246 ev per hydrogen bond , 4 hydrogen bonds per water molecule , and assuming bulk water ice density i.e. about @xmath247 water molecules / m@xmath248 , we obtain @xmath249 jm@xmath250 ( equivalent to force per unit area ) , from which we deduce the tentative strength against fracture @xmath251 nm@xmath245 .    substituting this value in ( [ fracture ] ) with",
    "@xmath127 yields the minimum grain radius @xmath252 nm . this figure varies with the grain s tensile strength @xmath241 as @xmath253 , so that varying @xmath241 by a factor of 5 would produce a variation in @xmath89 of about 50 % .",
    "note also that 0.7 nm is roughly the size of a unit cell of a ih ice crystal and twice the width of an elementary step of ice crystallization @xcite .",
    "another size limitation might be produced by the centrifugal stress due to the grain s spin induced by impacts of molecules @xcite .",
    "contrary to the above electrostatic limit , it also acts on uncharged grains . at equilibrium ( justified by eq .",
    "( [ tauspin ] ) ) , the rms angular speed @xmath254 of a grain due to collisions with neutrals of temperature @xmath255 satisfies @xmath256 where @xmath257 .",
    "a spinning grain of mass density @xmath258 will be destroyed if @xmath259 , which yields the survival condition ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath260 substituting @xmath261 ev @xcite and the order of magnitude @xmath251 nm@xmath245 determined above , we obtain @xmath262 nm . since this limit is smaller than the electrostatic disruption limit ( [ fracture ] ) , centrifugal disruption is not expected to play a major role .",
    "note that we do not consider the spin induced by the impacts of ions of temperature @xmath2 ( although this would yield a size limit higher by the factor @xmath263 ) , because the ion number density is too small for inducing a significant grain s spin during the time scales involved .",
    "indeed , for the grains to acquire a spin governed by the thermal energy of a particle species , they should have been struck by their own mass of these particles . applying ( [ n0 ] ) to h@xmath264o molecules of mass @xmath265 yields the time scale @xmath266 whence @xmath267 s , which is of the order of magnitude of the time scales involved and smaller by more than two orders of magnitude than the value for ion impacts ( which confirms that the latter do not affect the grains spin ) .",
    "we have derived analytical expressions for the charge of nanograins in cold dense and dusty environments , under conditions relevant in the outer solar system , and applied them to enceladus nanograins .",
    "this analysis shows that a large proportion of nanograins should be charged with one electron , as assumed in previous studies and argued by @xcite , and that the impacts of ambient ions should explain the observed positively charged grains without having to assume other charging processes .",
    "electrostatic stresses are expected to limit the size of charged grains to a minimum radius of about 0.7 nm - a value which should be taken with caution since it assumes a compact structure and varies with the badly known grain tensile strength @xmath241 in proportion of @xmath253 .",
    "this effect might contribute to the strong decrease in the grain number density observed at radii below about 1 nm @xcite .",
    "however , subnanometric ice grains fall into the uncertain transition region between macroscopic and microscopic behavior . in particular , the electron sticking coefficient @xmath38 is expected to decrease nearly linearly with radius for @xmath268 nm @xcite ; according to ( [ f-1f0 ] ) and ( [ zmean1 ] ) , this should decrease the grain s charge and therefore the probability of detection below @xmath4 nm .",
    "furthermore , the detailed physics of ice crystallization is still not understood , and a grain of radius 1 nm with the density of ice contains only @xmath269 h@xmath264o molecules , more than 50 % of which should lie at the surface .",
    "this number is smaller than the recently determined minimum number of @xmath270 h@xmath264o molecules required for crystallization of a water cluster @xcite , which corresponds to a radius of about 1.3 @xmath271 m with the density of ice .",
    "this radius of 1.3 @xmath271 m ( whose dependence on temperature is unknown and which should be taken with caution in the context of enceladus plume ) , is close to the observed onset of flux decrease @xcite .",
