    "this effect will be more extensively discussed in the next paragraphs .    at temperatures",
    "@xmath26 , the mr follows an @xmath27 dependence which is depicted in figure [ mr ] .",
    "this behavior suggests that the main source of magnetoresistance in this temperature interval is the zeeman splitting of the electronic bands at the fermi level towards spin - up and spin - down ones separated by @xmath28 . theoretical work of dieterich and fulde @xcite predicted that a sufficiently strong magnetic field reduces the pairing interaction between electrons , lowers the cdw electronic gap ( @xmath29 ) and suppresses the cdw ground state . as a consequence",

    "when @xmath29 is much larger than @xmath32 , the negative magnetoresistance due to an increase of free electronic carriers can be expressed by the formula @xcite :    @xmath33        as depicted in the inset of figure [ mr ] , the magnetoresistance of gdnic@xmath0 scales with @xmath34 in the wide temperature interval of @xmath35 k @xmath36 k. this evidences that zeeman suppression of the cdw is a driving force of large negative mr in this temperature range .",

    "good examples are the magnetoresistance scaled by 0.25 in li@xmath38mo@xmath39o@xmath40 @xcite or a number of organic compounds with @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite shown that the presence of weakly magnetic chains in ( per)@xmath0pt(mnt)@xmath0 leading to the local increase of internal magnetic field , enhances the cdw suppression with @xmath12 . as a result one observes the @xmath31 parameter larger in comparison with a similar compound ( per)@xmath0au(mnt)@xmath0 in which the magnetic chains are absent .",
    "this effect is in some extent similar to the case of gdnic@xmath0 .",
    "however , in contrast to the aforementioned systems , where the local magnetic moments are insignificant , in gdnic@xmath0 , the gd@xmath42 ions carry a large moment of ca .",
    "@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the presence of such local moments produces a strong internal magnetic field acting on neighboring ni atoms , and that results in the large value of magnetoresistance prefactor .",
    "such transferred magnetic fields have been observed through mssbauer spectroscopy ( ms ) measurements in hyperfine structures of various nonmagnetic atoms embedded in magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the ms measurements on gdnic@xmath0 at 4.2 k have revealed a hyperfine magnetic field of 34 t acting at gd nuclei @xcite , but no reports on ni hyperfine fields exist to the author s knowledge .",
    "we also suggest , that due to the presence of such strong magnetic moments in gdnic@xmath0 one can safely assume , that the enhancement of the cdw suppression originates mostly from the spin magnetic moments from gd@xmath42 and the contribution to @xmath31 from the orbital effects , observed in ( per)@xmath0au(mnt)@xmath0 @xcite , is insignificant in comparison to the influence of the spin mechanism .",
    "although the magnetoresistance stands in agreement with theory , we have found no visible modification of the peierls temperature in magnetic field .",
    "the shift of @xmath7 due to zeeman suppression of the cdw gap has been observed only in several materials with the @xmath7 as low as 8 k or 12 k@xcite .",
    "since the peierls temperature in gdnic@xmath0 is relatively high , @xmath44 is two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath45 at our maximum field of 9 t. then , even considering the factor @xmath31 = 30 in eq . [ mreq2 ] , the expected @xmath7 shift is only @xmath37 1.3 k at 9 t. such a small difference is difficult to observe within experimental resolution for the polycrystalline sample .",
    "furthermore , lack of visible deviation from the mean - field ( eq . [ zeeman ] ) scaling , including signs of saturation , which was seen in li@xmath38mo@xmath39o@xmath40 @xcite due to complete destruction of cdw at high magnetic fields suggests , that the suppression of the charge density wave observed in gdnic@xmath0 is not complete for @xmath26 , and the peierls instability ( at least partly ) survives in the presence of the external magnetic field of 9 t.    figure [ mrlt ] shows the magnetoresistance of gdnic@xmath0 measured at temperatures in the vicinity and below @xmath1 .",
    "the curve measured at @xmath16 = 30 k shows @xmath17 behavior described above . as temperature is lowered to 24 k",
    ", one can observe two kinks in mr@xmath46 .",
    "first , one appears at , roughly , 4.5 t and is accompanied by a small hysteresis ; a second one is found at @xmath37 6.5 t and shows no hysteretic behavior . upon further decreasing the temperature ,",
    "the former term becomes sharper and dominates over the latter one .",
    "eventually , at 10 k , mr@xmath46 shows an abrupt drop at fields between 4 and 6 t. at higher fields , mr shows a further , yet much slower , decrease .",
    "owing to the phase diagram of gdnic@xmath0 and our magnetization data , we find that both anomalies correspond to the phase transitions towards a metamagnetic phase ( mm in fig [ cp]b ) . above 10 k",
    "this process occurs via the intermediate magnetic phase , which explains the existence of two kinks in mr(@xmath12 ) .",
    "in contrast to that , at t @xmath47 10 k , the increase of magnetic field transforms the system directly from af to metamagnetic phase without any intermediate stage , which is pronounced by a single anomaly .",
    "this steep decrease of resistivity is reminiscent with the behavior of magnetoresistance in ndnic@xmath0 @xcite , where the cdw state surviving the transition to af state was definitely suppressed by a magnetic field induced spin - flop transition .",
    "a similar effect was observed slightly above the curie temperature in smnic@xmath0 @xcite , where application of magnetic field causes the transition into a ferromagnetic state , which results in a destruction of cdw .",
    "this suggests , that the effect observed in gdnic@xmath0 is of the same origin as in the compounds recalled above .",
    "the wavevector @xmath48 of the cdw modulation appears to play a key role in the interplay between cdw and af .",
    "agreement between @xmath48 and the magnetic propagation vector leads to a sort of resonance , which prevents the local magnetic moments from breaking the pairing interaction and , in this scenario cdw and af orders coexist @xcite . deviation from this condition leads then to breaking of the singlet electron - hole pairs forming the cdw . although the magnetic structure of gdnic@xmath0 has not been precisely defined yet , matsuo et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the propagation vector of @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "this value corresponds with the cdw modulation vector , which becomes doubly commensurate at @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "when a magnetic field induces a change of magnetic structure this resonance becomes disturbed , which leads to suppression of the cdw and release of condensed carriers .",
    "one shall also consider the possibility of the electronic bands structure modification upon the af - mm transition .",
    "this leads to the change of the nesting conditions and may eventually act as another mechanism suppressing the cdw .    to support this scenario",
    ", we have followed an analysis proposed by yamamoto et al .",
    "@xcite and compared the ratio of resistivity in gdnic@xmath0 measured at 2 k ( thus in presence of magnetic order ) , with and without magnetic field , respectively and at a temperature slightly above the af transition , with corresponding values obtained for and ndnic@xmath0 . in gdnic@xmath0 , @xmath51 = 0.51 and @xmath52= 0.18   @xcite .",
    "these quantities parallel relevant ratios for ndnic@xmath0 : in the presence of af , partially suppressing cdw : @xmath53 0.4 and @xmath54 0.16 at the same temperature , albeit in the presence of a magnetic field in which the cdw is completely suppressed . to compare , in smnic@xmath0@xcite , where the fm order entirely destroys the cdw , the ratio @xmath55 0.1 .",
    "these results are consistent with the scenario of partial destruction of the cdw in the af state of gdnic@xmath0 and the further suppression of the peierls instability with increasing magnetic field , which drives the metamagnetic crossover .",
    "we emphasize that , although this comparison suggests a strong suppression of the peierls instability in the mm state , x - ray diffuse scattering experiment showing the absence of satellite reflections is required to deliver unambiguous evidence of complete cdw destruction .",
    "due to polycrystalline nature of our samples , we were unable to explore the thermal and magnetic field evolution of cdw satellite peaks via x - ray diffuse scattering .",
    "instead , we have conducted a study of the hall effect to complement the magnetoresistance data .",
    "figure [ hall1 ] shows the thermal dependence of the hall resistivity normalized by magnetic field ( @xmath56 ) measured at various magnetic fields . above @xmath7 , @xmath56 is almost temperature independent . at the peierls temperature one observes a decrease of hall resistivity due to condensation of part of the electronic carriers into the cdw state .",
    "the lock - in transition is pronounced as an inflection in the @xmath57 curve .",
