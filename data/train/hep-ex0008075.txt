    "identification and measurement of muons in the inner tracker using its high spatial resolution and excellent momentum measurement in the 4 t field is a very important and demanding task , particularly for muons in jets . in the muon system",
    "the occupancy is low and pattern recognition is relatively easy , provided the particle reaches the muon system at all , which is the case for the barrel is p@xmath4 4 gev . for non - isolated muons",
    "the main difficulty is to match the track observed in the muon stations with the correct candidate in the inner tracker in case of the high track density inside a jet .",
    "these situations arise for example in muon tagging of @xmath5-jets , in @xmath5 @xmath2 @xmath6(@xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath3 ) + @xmath7 cascades in @xmath5 and @xmath8 physics , in susy(@xmath9 , @xmath10 ) physics and most dramatically in very high e@xmath1 ( tev scale ) jets such as heavy flavour ( @xmath5 , @xmath11 ) qcd jets giving rise to `` muon bundles '' within jets .",
    "the matching strategy is based on the use of the full parameter space , i.e. on both the reconstructed momentum and the position in a given plane for the two tracks , one in the muon system and the other in the inner tracker .",
    "the quantities monitored are the efficiency of matching ( number of muons matched over number of muons reconstructed ) , the muon matching impurity ( 1 - number of muons matched over number of tracks matched ) and generation of `` ghost '' and `` fake '' tracks .",
    "the results discussed here are obtained using a detailed geant description of the complete cms detector of tdr design . in all simulations the effects of the 4 t field are fully included .",
    "we have performed a geant simulation of the response to @xmath0 jets with transverse momenta p@xmath12 of 50 , 100 and 200 gev ( which corresponds to the p@xmath1 range of @xmath5-jets in @xmath13 production ) and at least one muon inside each jet with p@xmath14 @xmath15 5 gev in the rapidity region -1.1",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath16 1.1 .",
    "1000 events were generated and reconstructed in the barrel part at each energy point .",
    "the results are obtained using the standard cms reconstruction procedure ( data card muon 2 and trak 3 ) existing in the cmsim version 115 .",
    "pattern recognition in the muon stations is done by building track segments from the reconstructed hits separately in the ( r,@xmath18 ) and ( r , z ) planes ; ( r@xmath18,rz ) track segments in the same muon station and in the same or contiguous ( r,@xmath18 ) sectors are considered to form a pair used to perform the kalman filter .",
    "this is done starting from the outermost stations and proceeding towards the inner stations with a constrained fit to the impact point ( ip ) with default values of @xmath19 = 15 @xmath20 and @xmath21 = 5.3 cm .",
    "since the decay mean transverse length ( impact parameter ) of the @xmath5-quarks is about 500 @xmath20 another reconstruction was made using a constrained fit to the impact point with @xmath19 = 500 @xmath20 and @xmath21 = 5.3 cm .",
    "the global track finder ( gtf ) was used for pattern recognition in the cms inner tracker . the gtf algorithm adopted for the cms tracker must process a large number of hits per event : typically 5.10@xmath22 hits at low luminosity and ten times more at high luminosity . to overcome the severe combinatorial problems , the concept of road preselection is used in the first stage of the algorithm . in the second stage a kalman filter",
    "is used to carry out final hit selection and track fitting .",
    "given two track segments , one in the muon system and the other in the inner tracker , one can extrapolate both segments to a common plane or point , check the difference in momentum and position and select the best combination among the candidates .",
    "the correct combination is known from the simulation procedure and it is therefore possible to calculate the efficiency of matching .",
    "we use as a matching criterion the minimal distance computed from @xmath17 , @xmath18 and/or p@xmath23 of the two track candidates at the outer plane ( trci - cmsim convention ) of the inner tracker and at the impact point .",
    "association of reconstructed tracks to geant ones is done on the hit basis .",
    "the reconstructed track is associated to a given geant particle number if more than half of the hits assigned to the track are from that particular geant track .",
    "if there is no such dominating track , the reconstructed track is called a `` ghost '' .",
    "if more than one reconstructed track is matched to a given geant number it is called a `` fake '' .    the @xmath17 dependence of the reconstruction efficiency obtained for the barrel muon station , shown on fig .",
    "1a ) is rather uniform except for the region between the central and next - to - central rings ( @xmath24 @xmath16 0.2 ) and for @xmath24 @xmath15 0.9 . to avoid the influence of the @xmath17 dependence of the reconstruction efficiency on the matching results the tracks with @xmath24 @xmath15 0.9",
    "are removed . the p@xmath1 reconstruction efficiency ( fig .",
    "1b ) ) is more than 95% for the tracks with p@xmath14 @xmath15 10 gev . in fig .",
    "1c ) is given the `` type '' of reconstructed tracks in the muon stations ( solid line ) for which must be found the best candidate between the tracks reconstructed in the tracker ( error bars ) .",

    "1d ) - fig .",
    "1i ) both for the barrel muon stations and for the inner tracker , for p@xmath12 = 100 gev .",
    "we find a p@xmath1 muon resolution of about 10% for the muon stations alone , and of @xmath16 1% for the inner tracker , in good agreement with the values given in the muon and tracker tdrs@xmath25 .    to estimate the matching quality a @xmath26 is formed from the differences between reconstructed @xmath17 , @xmath18 and p@xmath1 in the two detectors for all reconstructed track combinations at the outer tracker plane and at the impact point :    @xmath27    including in the @xmath26 , equation ( 1 ) , the contribution from p@xmath23 in the muon stations and the tracker improves the selection of the matching tracks mainly for the high transverse momenta .",
    "a minimal @xmath26 of the matching tracks has been used as a matching criterion .    the p@xmath1 dependence of the matching efficiency is shown on fig . 2 for p@xmath12 = 50 , 100 and 200 gev at the outer plane trci of the inner tracker and at the interaction point with the two assumptions for the constrained fit to the impact point with @xmath28 = 15 @xmath20 and @xmath28 = 500 @xmath20 .",
    "the degradation of the matching efficiency at higher p@xmath12 is is due to the increase of charged particle multiplicity inside jets which makes more difficult the correct association of the tracks observed in the muon stations with the track candidates in the inner tracker .",
    "the matching efficiency shows less variation when a constrained fit at the impact point is performed using @xmath28 = 500 @xmath20 .",
    "results obtained from the matching of muons inside the @xmath0 jets at p@xmath12 of 50 , 100 and 200 gev are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the `` type '' of the matched tracks indicates a higher purity at the impact point and at lower jet momenta . for the higher multiplicity and more collimated jets at p@xmath12 = 200 gev",
    ", the impurity in matching degrades to a @xmath29 7% level . rejecting tracks with an increasing momentum threshold @xmath16 p@xmath30 ,",
    "a high matching efficiency and purity of track matching can be obtained for high p@xmath12 , but at the expense of a substantial reduction in statistics .",
    "the number of `` ghost '' tracks generated at reconstruction in the muon stations is negligible .",
    "the number of `` fake '' tracks shows some tendency to increase with jets momenta , and is at level of 1% - 2% .    after performing the matching procedure we can assign to the tracks observed in the muon station the precise measurements from the tracker .",
    "the distributions of the differences between reconstructed and generated values of p@xmath1 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 at the impact point for the matched tracks at p@xmath12 = 100 gev are given in fig .",
    "3 . these distributions are practically the same as in fig .",
    "2 , where we compared reconstructed and generated variables for the inner tracker , confirming the good quality of the matching criterion . the bottom row in fig .",
    "3 gives the `` type '' of the tracks reconstructed in the muon stations and the `` type '' of matched tracks at the impact point .",
    "the quality of track matching can be measured by the value of the `` pull '' :    @xmath31    where :    z@xmath32 , z@xmath33 is the track charge in the tracker and the muon station ;    p@xmath32 , p@xmath33 is the reconstructed momentum in tracker and muon station ;    cov(1/p.1/p ) is the covariance matrix .    a gaussian fit to the pull shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "3 gives @xmath34 @xmath29 1.0 indicating a good accuracy for the selection and matching of the tracks .",
    "the main results concerning the matching of muon tracks in ( @xmath0 ) jets between the muon stations and inner tracker are :    using a simple minimal distance criterion between @xmath17 , @xmath18 and p@xmath1 of independent track measurements at the impact point one can obtain a high matching efficiency with a contamination of not more than 4% for p@xmath12 of 50 gev and 6% for 100 gev . for the more collimated jets with p@xmath12 = 200 gev ,",
    "the impurity in matching is at a @xmath29 7% level .",
    "the matching efficiency shows less variation when a constrained fit at the impact point is performed with @xmath28 = 500 @xmath20 . to further improve the matching efficiency and impurity a more sophisticated software than currently available",
    "must be used , for example a constrain fir to the secondary @xmath0 jets vertices obtained from the inner tracker can be performed ."
