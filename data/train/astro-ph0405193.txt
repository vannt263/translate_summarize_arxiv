    "the availability of large sets of stellar evolution models spanning a wide range of stellar masses and initial chemical compositions is a necessary prerequisite for any investigation aimed at interpreting observations of galactic and extragalactic , resolved and unresolved stellar populations .",
    "a reliable library of stellar evolution models used to study stellar populations in various environments has to satisfy at least three main criteria : 1 ) the input physics has to be up to date and the treatment of physical processes has to be adequate and as much accurate as possible ; 2 ) the set of models has to be homogeneous , in the sense that all evolutionary phases and initial chemical compositions have to be computed with the same evolutionary code and the same physical framework ; 3 ) the models have to reproduce as many empirical constraints as possible .",
    "the accuracy of the results obtained from methods based on stellar evolution models is strongly dependent on the reliability of the physical framework adopted in the computations . in this respect , it is very interesting to notice that only about a decade ago the available stellar models were already producing models that matched reasonably well several observational constraints .",
    "however , new results from helioseismology came to show that solar models available at that time were seriously challenged by these new empirical results .",
    "this stimulated a large effort toward improving our knowledge of the physics of stellar matter , and as a consequence , in these last years , several aspects of stellar physics ( e.g. , radiative opacities , equation of state ) have been largely improved .",
    "this process has produced a continuous improvement in solar models as well as in the whole stellar evolution field , with non - negligible variations in quantitative predictions , as in the case of the galactic globular cluster ages ( e.g. chaboyer et al .",
    "1995 ; mazzitelli , dantona & caloi  1995 ; salaris , deglinnocenti & weiss  1997 ) . a detailed discussion of the effect of recent improvements in the input physics on the stellar evolution results can be found in cassisi et al .",
    "this evidence provides a clear support for the need of a continuos improvement and update of stellar model databases .",
    "the homogeneity of the adopted model library is also extremely important , because the use of different sets of models ( computed by different authors with different input phsyics ) for different evolutionary phases and/or chemical compositions and/or mass ranges can introduce subtle inconsistencies in the interpretation of observations , and can affect the predictive power of stellar population synthesis techniques .",
    "as for the comparison with empirical constraints , it goes without saying that this is the best way to assess the reliability of the chosen evolutionary scenario . in particular , it is very important to compare theoretical models with empirical constraints from resolved stellar populations , such as galactic field stars and galactic stellar clusters .",
    "this is a fundamental step in order to be able to estimate the level of accuracy of the models , as well as for evaluating the uncertainties which could affect the population synthesis analysis based on the same models .",
    "the need of continuously improved stellar evolution databases ( in spite of the already existing large number of stellar models and isochrone sets ) incorporating the latest advances in modeling the stellar physics can not be more emphasized by the fact that existing differences among stellar model libraries translate into large uncertainties in , just to give an example , the ages of external galaxies ; this is well illustrated by , e.g. , the large differences obtained by spinrad et al .  (",
    "1997 ) and yi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , regarding the age ( at least 3.5 gyr vs. 1.41.8 gyr , respectively ) of an unresolved high - redshift galaxy ( lbds 53w091 ) , due mainly to large differences in the colors ( and spectra ) predicted by the two different sets of isochrones used in the two mentioned papers .",
    "such large differences due only to uncertainties in the modeling of stellar populations have important consequences for our interpretation of the epoch and mechanisms of galaxy formation .",
    "only by employing independent sets of stellar model databases one can assess the real uncertainties in the inferred parameters for resolved and unresolved stellar populations . in case of some key stellar input physics , like ,",
    "i.e. , boundary conditions , overshooting , atomic diffusion efficiency , mass loss , it is not yet clear what the best prescription is ; to this one has to add current uncertainties on the synthetic spectra used to transform the output of theoretical stellar models into observed quantities like colors , magnitudes , line strengths .",
    "it is therefore necessary the availability of independent sets of models , computed with the best possible choices of the well established physics , and with various choices for the parameters describing the physical processes not yet well understood .",
    "it is therefore important that several sets of models are available , computed with the best possible inputs for the well established physics ( e.g. , equation of state , opacities ) , and with various choices of the parameters describing the physical processes not yet well understood ( e.g. , mixing , convection , mass loss ) .",
    "the recent literature is rich of updates of stellar model libraries , see , e.g. , bono et al .",

    "( 2000 ) , vandenberg et al .",

    "( 2001 ) and castellani et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; however not all of them cover homogeneously a large range of ages and chemical compositions .",
    "over the years , we have published a lot of specialized papers with a series of specific goals , other than addressing the issue of population synthesis techniques .",
    "we have investigated the effects of improvements in the adopted physical inputs on stellar models ( salaris & cassisi  1996 ; brocato , cassisi & castellani  1998 ; cassisi et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 and references therein ) ; we have compared our low mass isochrones with selected observational constraints from old stars ( e.g. , cassisi & salaris  1997 ; salaris & cassisi  1998 ; riello et al .",
    "2003 ) and obtained estimates of galactic globular cluster ages ( e.g. , salaris , deglinnocenti & weiss  1997 ; salaris & weiss  1998 , 1999 , 2002 ) , initial he abundance of globular cluster stars ( cassisi , salaris & irwin 2003 ; salaris et al .",
    "2004 ) , pulsational properties of variable stars ( de santis & cassisi 1999 ; bono et al .",
    "this notwithstanding , we have never published an extended and homogeneous set of stellar models covering a large range of stellar masses , chemical compositions and evolutionary phases , suitable for population synthesis analysis as well as for any other kind of investigation making extensive use of stellar evolution models .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to fill this gap , by providing an up - to - date and complete set of stellar models for both low - and intermediate mass , and high mass stars up to 10 @xmath10 , spanning a large metallicity regime from metal - poor star systems to super - metal - rich populations .",
    "our updated theoretical models are then coupled to a new set of color - transformation and bolometric corrections . in this paper ,",
    "all theoretical results are based on a scaled solar metal distribution .",
    "the case of an @xmath11element enhanced metal mixture will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : ",
    "2 summarizes the improvements made to our evolutionary code , while   3 deals specifically with the difficult problem of the core convection treatment .",
    "our standard solar model is briefly discussed in   4 , and the model library is presented in   5 .",
    "comparisons with the most used existing isochrone databases , and with selected empirical constraints are discussed in   6 , and   7 , respectively .",
    "a summary and conclusions follow in   8 .",
    "the stellar evolution code adopted in this work is the same used by cassisi & salaris  ( 1997 ) and salaris & cassisi  ( 1998 ) , with various updates .",
    "we have added the nuclear burning of light elements as li , b and be , improved the numerical procedures that optimize the choice of both the number of mesh points within a model , and the evolutionary time steps , and updated the model input physics . in the following we summarize our choice of the most relevant input physics , and  in case of differences with our previous cassisi & salaris  ( 1997 ) models  we discuss its impact on relevant model parameters .    *",
    "the radiative opacities are from the opal tables ( iglesias & rogers  1996 ) for temperatures larger than @xmath12 k , whereas the opacities by alexander & ferguson  ( 1994 ) which include the contribution from molecules and grain have been adopted for lower temperatures .",
    "both high and low temperature opacity tables assume a scaled solar heavy element distribution ( grevesse & noels  1993 ) . as for the electron conduction opacities we use the recent results by potekhin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and potekhin  ( 1999 , hereinafter p99 ) .",
    "these computations cover also the physical conditions typical of degenerate he cores in red giant branch stars ; this avoids the extrapolation one had to perform with our previous choice of the itoh et al .",
    "( 1983 , 1993 , hereinafter - i93 ) conductive opacities since , as first shown by catelan , de freitas pacheco & horwath  ( 1996 ) , the i93 opacities did not cover the degenerate he cores in low mass stars . before computing the whole set of evolutionary models presented in this work , we have tested the effect of the p99 opacity on the size of electron",
    "degenerate he cores at the he flash ignition : at a metallicity z=0.002 the change of the he core mass at the he flash in a @xmath13 model is equal to @xmath14 , in the sense that the p99 opacities produce a less massive he core with respect the i93 , but at solar composition the trend reverses , the he core mass being @xmath15 larger when using the p99 opacity .",
    "it is clear that the effect related to the use of the p99 data is not large .",
    "this notwithstanding we decided to update our code by using the p99 opacities , in order to avoid any extrapolation .",
    "* we updated the energy loss rates for plasma - neutrino processes ( relevant in the he degenerate cores ) using the most recent and accurate results provided by haft , raffelt & weiss ( 1994 ) .",
    "for all other processes we still rely on the same prescriptions adopted by cassisi & salaris  ( 1997 ) . in case of a 1@xmath10 star with @xmath16=0.002 , these new neutrino rates produce a he core mass at the he flash @xmath90.005 @xmath10 larger ( and the corresponding @xmath17 is increased by @xmath90.025 ) than our previous results based on the munakata , kohyama & itoh  ( 1985 ) rates .",
    "however , the same 1@xmath10 star at solar metallicity ( see   4 ) shows an he core mass at the he flash decreased by 0.003 @xmath10 ( the corresponding @xmath17 is decreased by @xmath90.015 ) with respect to our previous models .",
    "* the nuclear reaction rates have been updated by using values from the nacre database ( angulo et al .",
    "1999 ) , with the exception of the @xmath18c@xmath19o reaction . for this reaction",
    "we employ the more accurate recent determination by kunz et al .",
    "electron screening is treated according to graboske et al .",
    "we have tested the effect on the main sequence turn off luminosity when passing from our previously adopted rates ( caughlan & fowler  1988 ) to the nacre ones .",
    "we found that for a 1@xmath10 star of solar composition the age at the turn off increases by 0.6 % , and log(@xmath20 at the turn off increases by @xmath9 3.5% .",
    "+ the new @xmath18c@xmath19o rate by kunz et al .  ( 2002 ) reduces the he burning evolutionary lifetimes ( at a fixed he core core mass and envelope composition ) by approximately 7 - 8 % , with respect to the results obtained with our previously adopted caughlan et al .",
    "( 1985 ) rate . * the detailed equation of state ( eos ) by a. irwin has been used .",
    "a full description of this eos is still in preparation ( irwin et al .",
    "2004 ) but a brief discussion of its main characteristics can be found in cassisi , salaris & irwin ( 2003 ) .",
    "this eos can cover the entire stellar structure along all the main evolutionary phases of stars in a large mass range ( including the full mass range spanned by our present models ) ; the accuracy of this eos is similar to the case of the opal eos ( rogers , swenson & iglesias  1996 )  and recently updated in the treatment of some physical inputs ( rogers & nayfonov 2002 )  that however does not allow the full coverage of the stellar models presented in this work .",
    "in fact , e.g. , the new opal eos has still an upper limit to the temperature of @xmath21 k , and this prevents any evolutionary computation beyond the approach to the he burning ignition .",
    "+ to give an idea of the differences between our adopted eos and the opal one in the common range of validity , we show in fig .",
    "[ sspeed ] a comparison of the run of the ratio u = p/@xmath22 as a function of the distance from the star center , obtained from our calibrated solar model ( see   4 ) , and a solar model calibrated using the opal eos . in both calibrated models the surface @xmath23 ratio , envelope he abundance and depth of the convective envelope match the empirical determinations ( see below and   4 ) . besides the comparison with the values of u inferred from helioseismology ( data from deglinnocenti et al .",
    "1997 ) it is important to notice how our adopted eos closely matches the results obtained with the opal one .",
    "+ as for the effect of passing from the eos used in cassisi & salaris  ( 1997 ) to the actual one , we performed a test by computing the evolution of a 1@xmath10 star of solar metallicity up to the he flash , using both eoss and keeping everything else fixed . with the new irwin",
    "eos the zero age main sequence log@xmath24 is @xmath925 % brighter , and its effective temperature @xmath9250 k hotter ; the turn off log@xmath24 is @xmath910 % brighter , its effective temperature @xmath9190 k higher and its age is 1.6 gyr younger ( @xmath916 % younger ) . at the he flash this age difference is preserved , whereas the he core mass is 0.01 @xmath10 smaller .",
    "* our stellar evolution code can account for the atomic diffusion of both helium and heavy elements .",
    "the diffusion coefficients are calculated by means of a routine provided by a. thoul ( 1995 , private communication ) , which solves burgers s equation for a multicomponent fluid ( thoul , bahcall & loeb  1994 , see also the in depth discussion by schlattl & salaris  2003 ) . at variance with canonical computations",
    "in which the total metallicity does not change within the star , when diffusion occurs the metal abundances display a gradient across the stellar structure .",
    "however , being all elements heavier than carbon more or less equally diffused , the abundance ratios are not significantly affected by atomic diffusion , and this allows to account for the effects of diffusion on the stellar opacity simply by interpolating among scaled - solar opacity tables of different z. + we have properly accounted for atomic diffusion only when computing the standard solar models ( see   4 ) .",
    "the whole set of evolutionary models presented in this paper has been computed without including atomic diffusion .",
    "in fact , although in the sun atomic diffusion is basically fully efficient , spectroscopic observations of , e.g. , stars in galactic globular clusters or field halo stars ( see , e.g. , gratton et al .",
    "2001 ; bonifacio et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) point to a drastically reduced efficiency of diffusion , maybe due to the counteracting effect of some sort of rotational mixing processes .",
    "this raises the possibility that the almost uninhibited efficiency of diffusion found in the sun might not be a common occurrence . in view of this uncertainty",
    "we decided , conservatively , to not include in our model grid computation the effect of atomic diffusion . * the outer boundary conditions",
    "have been computed integrating the atmospheric layers with the @xmath25 relation provided by krishna - swamy  ( 1966 ) .",
    "superadiabatic convection is treated according to the cox & giuli  ( 1968 ) formalism of the mixing length theory ( bhm - vitense  1958 ) .",
    "the mixing length parameter has been fixed by the solar calibration and kept constant for all masses during all evolutionary phases ( see , e.g. , freytag & salaris  1999 ) .",
    "* all models include mass loss using the reimers formula ( reimers 1975 ) with the free parameter @xmath26 set to 0.4 .",
    "this value of @xmath26 is commonly assumed ( e.g. girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) because it allows to broadly reproduce the mean colors of horizontal branches in galactic globular clusters .",
    "we are in the process of computing an additional set of models ( for all metallicities in our grid ) that employs @xmath26=0.2 , in order to provide a tool to assess the impact of different efficiency of mass loss on various properties of simple and composite stellar populations ( e.g. , their integrated colors ) .",
    "stars with masses larger than @xmath27 ( the exact value depends on the initial chemical composition ) during the central h - burning phase develop a convective core , due to the dependence of the cno - cycle efficiency on temperature .",
    "the instability against turbulent convection is classically handled by means of the schwarzschild criterion for a chemically homogeneous fluid .",
    "this well known criterion is based on the comparison between the expected temperature gradient produced by the radiative transport of energy , and the adiabatic one .",
    "it is worth noticing that the proper estimate of the size of the convective region is then primarily dependent on the accuracy of the input physics .",
    "any improvement of the adopted physics may produce a change in the temperature gradients and , in turn modify the location of the boundaries of the convective regions .    a second important point concerns the possibility that the motion of the convective fluid elements is not halted at the boundary with the stable region beyond the formal convective core .",
    "although beyond the schwarzschild boundary a moving fluid element is subject to a strong deceleration , it might be possible that a nonzero velocity is mantained along a certain length .",
    "this mechanical overshoot may induce a significant amount of mixing in a region formally stable against convection ( see cordier et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "finally , another important point which has to be taken into account is that a sizeable increase in the internal mixed region , hence larger convective cores , could be obtained as a consequence of rotationally induced mixing ( meynet & maeder  2000 ) .",
    "there are therefore at least three different reasons ( inadequate input physics , overshooting from the convective boundary , additional mixing due to rotation ) why the size of the real stellar convective cores might be different from the one predicted by  models , that is , models computed neglecting rotation , and overshooting from the schwarzschild convective boundary .",
    "this evidence raises the question if the size of the convective core , as determined by the ( classical ) schwarzschild criterion is able to properly match the observations , or it has to be  increased .",
    "discrepancies with observations have been usually interpreted in terms of the efficiency of an _ overshooting _",
    "mechanism ; the extension of this additional mixed region is usually defined in terms of a parameter @xmath28 which gives the length  expressed as a fraction of the local pressure scale height @xmath29  crossed by the convective cells in the convectively stable region outside the schwarschild convective boundary .    the case for a significant amount of overshooting has been presented many times both theoretically and observationally , although in some cases the results have been contradictory ( see , e.g. , testa et al .  1999 ; barmina , girardi & chiosi  2002 ; brocato et al .",
    "2003 ) . what is well known is the effect of including overshooting in the stellar models : during the core h - burning phase the star has a larger he core , a brighter luminosity and a longer lifetime . during the following core he - burning phase , the luminosity is brighter , the lifetime is shorter and the blue loops in the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) are less extended than in the absence of overshooting .",
    "theory therefore predicts that the mass - luminosity ( m - l ) relationship for stars crossing the cepheid instability strip is largely affected by the amount of overshooting accounted for in the stellar evolution computations .",
    "the comparison of the theoretical m - l relationship with empirical data could , in principle , put tight constraints on the efficiency of this process .",
    "this approach has been recently adopted by keller & wood ( 2002 ) by adopting a large database of empirical data for bump cepheids and , the obtained results seem to support the occurrence of a large overshooting efficiency .",
    "although the method is sound , the results have to be cautiously treated , as clearly shown by cassisi ( 2004 ) .    due to the lack of a general consensus about the convective core overshooting efficiency",
    "our stellar models are computed both without overshooting and with a significant efficiency of this process . in the latter case ,",
    "we adopt @xmath30 .",
    "this value allows a good match between to the cmd of galactic open clusters of different ages , and allows us a comparison with the evolutionary models recently presented by other groups , all using a similar value of the overshooting parameter .",
    "the overshooting region is fully mixed as far as the chemical elements are concerned , and the temperature gradient is kept at its radiative value .",
    "another important issue to be addressed is the value of @xmath28 when stars have small convective cores .",
    "it is well known that the turn off ( to ) morphology of the evolutionary tracks and , in turn , of the isochrones , does depend on how the extent of the convective core decreases with decreasing mass .",
    "when moving deeper and deeper inside the star , the pressure scale height steadily increases ; this causes a large increase of the size of convective cores in stars whose schwarzschild convective boundary is fast shrinking , ( e.g. , for masses below @xmath31 ) if the overshooting efficiency is kept fixed at a constant fraction of @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear the need to decrease @xmath28 to zero for stars with small convective cores , a problem addressed theoretically by , e.g. , roxburgh  ( 1992 ) and woo & demarque  ( 2001 ) .    in order to show how critical this issue is ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ over0 ] two isochrones of the same chemical composition and age , obtained using different assumptions about the trend of @xmath28 with mass .",
    "the change in the isochrone morphology is quite significant and different choices concerning the core overshoot efficiency in the critical mass range @xmath32 mimic different isochrone ages .",
    "it is also worthwhile to notice the significant change in the shape of the to region .",
    "this means that the trend of @xmath28 with mass , for masses with small convective cores , potentially introduces an additional degree of freedom in stellar evolution models . even if this problem affects only a restricted range of cluster ages , it has to be taken into account when discussing the uncertainties affecting stellar models .    in our models with core overshooting ,",
    "regardless of the initial metallicity , we have chosen the following algorithm for varying the overshoot efficiency with mass : for masses larger or equal to 1.7@xmath33 we fixed @xmath28 at 0.20@xmath29 ; for stars less massive than @xmath34 we use @xmath35 ( we checked that all our models of at least @xmath34 show a central convective core during the ms ) , while in the intermediate range @xmath28 varies according to the relation @xmath28=@xmath36 .",
    "we have verified by performing several numerical experiments , that this choice allows a smooth variation of the isochrone to morphology , and a smooth decrease to zero of the convective cores for stars in this mass range .    moreover ,",
    "this choice for the overshooting extension does provide a good fit to the to morphology of a sample of clusters of various ages , as discussed later .",
    "in particular , our overshooting isochrones fit extremely well the to morphology of clusters like ngc  2420 and ngc  6819 where the typical to mass is @xmath37 ( for [ fe / h]=@xmath380.44 ) and @xmath39 ( for [ fe / h]=0.06 ) , respectively , i.e. in a mass range where the @xmath28 is decreasing according to our prescription .",
    "the case of m  67 ( sandquist  2004 , see also below ) and the eclipsing binary ai phoenicis ( see below ) seem however to indicate that @xmath400 when the stellar mass is equal to @xmath41 . since we provide both overshooting and canonical models , the user can freely choose to use a criterion based on age for the switch to @xmath28=0 models and isochrones .",
    "as for the convective cores during the he - burning phase , we account for semiconvection ( which is driven by mechanical overshooting from the boundary of the schwarzschild core ) at the border of the canonical convective core by using the numerical scheme described by castellani et al .",
    "( 1985 ) . near the core helium exhaustion we inhibited the breathing pulses ( castellani et al . 1985 ; dorman & rood 1993 ) , following the results by cassisi et al .",
    "the breathing pulses are suppressed adopting the procedure suggested by caputo et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , i.e. , by limiting the extent of the convective core so that the central helium abundance can not increase between consecutive models .",
    "we neglect the possible occurrence of overshooting from the bottom of the convective envelopes .",
    "this choice has been made in order to reduce as much as possible the number of free parameters in the stellar computations , and also in light of the fact that there is no clear - cut empirical evidence for a sizable efficiency of this phenomenon .",
    "a critical test for this phenomenon is the comparison between the position of the rgb bump in galactic globular clusters with the theoretical counterpart .",
    "a non negligible amount of overshooting from the bottom of the convective envelope does shift the bump to lower luminosities .",
    "this kind of test does not provide a definitive answer ( e.g. riello et al .",
    "2003 ) , mainly because of the uncertainty on the metallicity scale of globular clusters ( the bump position is also strongly affected by the initial stellar metallicity ) .",
    "it is however important to remark that convective envelope overshooting can affect the morphology of blue loops during the core he - burning phase ( alongi et al .",
    "1991 ; renzini et al . 1992 ; renzini & ritossa 1994 )",
    ". a detailed investigation of the dependence of blue loops on the physical assumptions adopted in stellar computations and a comparison with cepheid data will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the calibration of the standard solar model allows one to fix the value of the mixing length , as well as the solar initial he and metal fractions . in practice",
    ", one finds the combination of initial he ( @xmath42 ) and metal ( @xmath43 ) mass fractions , and the value of the mixing length parameter that reproduce the solar radius ( @xmath44 ) , luminosity ( @xmath45 , bahcall & pinsonneault 1995 ) and ratio @xmath46 ( grevesse & noels  1993 ) , at an age of @xmath47  gyr .",
    "the accuracy of the theoretical solar model can be then tested by comparing the depth of the outer convective layers and the surface @xmath48 value with the values 0.710  0.716@xmath49 ( castellani et al .",
    "1997 ) , and 0.2438 and 0.2443 ( dziembowski et al .  1995 ) , respectively , as obtained from helioseismological studies .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , bahcall & pinsonneault 1992 , 1995 ; basu et al .",
    "1996 ; bahcall , pinsonneault & basu 2001 and references therein ) that solar models without microscopic diffusion can not properly account for some features of the seismic sun . for this reason , we decided to account for atomic diffusion of both helium and metals when computing solar models , as described in section  2 .",
    "we have computed several models with mass equal to @xmath50 starting from the pre - ms phase , under different assumptions about the initial he and metal abundances , and mixing length parameter .",
    "the  solar model which fulfills the quoted requirements has been obtained for an initial @xmath42=0.2734 , an initial @xmath51 , and a mixing length value equal to 1.913 .",
    "this standard solar model is in agreement with the results from helioseismology concerning the depth of the convective envelope ( @xmath52 ) and the present surface he abundance ( @xmath53 ) , and with the actual ( z / x ) ratio ( ( z / x)=0.0244 ) .",
    "the value of the mixing length obtained from the calibration of the solar standard model is then adopted for the whole set of models presented in this work .",
    "we will show later that this choice of the mixing length coupled with the color - effective temperature transformations used in this work allows a fine match to several observational constraints .",
    "the initial solar he abundance and metallicity ( @xmath54 ) are the values adopted when computing the so called solar metallicity model set .",
    "as already stated , this work does provide an homogeneous and self - consistent database of theoretical stellar models and isochrones , based on the scaled solar heavy element distribution by grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) .",
    "the extension to models accounting for a suitable enhancement of @xmath55-elements will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .    in order to cover a wide range of chemical compositions , we provide models computed for 10 different metallicities , namely @xmath56 , 0.0003 , 0.001 , 0.002 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.01 , 0.0198 , 0.03 and 0.04 .    as far as the initial he - abundances are concerned , we adopt for the lowest metallicity the estimate recently provided by cassisi et al .",

    "the reason is that the model grid does not include diffusion ( which we know is active in the sun , but , as discussed before , possibly inhibited at least at the surface of other low mass stars ) ; when diffusion is included the solar metallicity composition would provide [ fe / h]=0 only at the solar age for solar - like models .",

[ hb ] ) .",
    "these models allow one to compute the cmd of synthetic hb populations , where there is a spread in the amount of mass lost along the rgb phase ( like the case of galactic globular clusters ) .",

    "the second condition requires also that the number of points between two consecutive kps has to be properly chosen .",

    "in particular , we have shown that with our models the initial he abundance of globular clusters as estimated from the @xmath57-parameter , is finally in agreement with the cosmological constraint ( cassisi et al .",
    "more tests on galactic globular cluster stars ( whose initial chemical composition is characterized by [ @xmath55/fe]@xmath1160 ) will be presented in the companion paper with the @xmath55-enhanced model grid .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "first , scaled solar isochrones are not an appropriate surrogate for @xmath55-enhanced ones with the same @xmath16 when @xmath16 is above @xmath1170.002 ( e.g. salaris & weiss  1998 ) ; second , from our new @xmath55-enhanced color transformations we have found that .",
    "e.g. , scaled solar @xmath77-effective temperature relationships are different from @xmath55-enhanced ones , starting from relatively low metallicities around @xmath118 0.001 .    in the comparisons detailed below , we employed the cmds of field stars and a sample of clusters with empirically established parameters like distance , [ fe / h ] ( and scaled solar metal mixture ) and reddening . in this way we do not have much freedom to change the parameters of our models in order to match the observations .",
    "comparisons with , e.g. , lmc clusters would be much less meaningful , since reddenings , [ fe / h ] ( especially ) and distances ( not only the distance to the lmc barycenter , but also geometrical effects ) are not well established empirically .",
    "we could fit the cmds of those clusters and give our estimates of their distance and reddening by playing with combinations of reddening , distance and [ fe / h ] , but this would not be a real test for the accuracy of the models",
    ".    we also refrained from comparing theoretical integrated colors with galactic open clusters or lmc data .",
    "the problem is that integrated colors of galactic open clusters are very uncertain due to their low total mass that induces large stochastic color fluctuations preventing any meaningful comparisons ( see , e.g. , the numerical experiments by bruzual & charlot  2003 and the integrated colors reported in the webda database ",
    "mermilliod  1992  at http://obswww.unige.ch/webda/integre.html ) .",
    "the same applies to lmc clusters , with the additional problems of not well known age and uncertain reddening . the situation is better for the more massive galactic globular clusters , and",
    "in fact we will perform ( using the appropriate @xmath55-enhanced theoretical isochrones and color transformations ) this comparison in our forthcoming paper about @xmath55-enhanced models . in the following comparisons , when necessary",
    ", we will use the reddening law @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis  1998 ) .",
    "percival et al .  (",
    "2002 ) have published homogeneous multicolor photometry and photometric metallicity estimates for a large sample of local field dwarfs with accurate @xmath8 parallaxes ; the [ fe / h ] values of the individual stars range from @xmath1220.4 up to + 0.3 .",
    "these data are extraordinarily well suited to test the ms location of our theoretical isochrones in various colour bands ; moreover , the choice of the isochrone age is irrelevant , since the observed stars are all unevolved , i.e. fainter than @xmath1235.5 .",
    "we have divided the percival et al .",
    "( 2002 ) sample into three subsamples , as follows .",
    "the most metal poor subsample comprises objects with [ fe / h ] between @xmath124 and @xmath380.15 , with an average value of [ fe / h]=@xmath125 ; the intermediate subsample contains stars with [ fe / h ] between @xmath380.05 and + 0.15 , with an average value of 0.06@xmath1260.06 .",
    "the third subsample is made of the most metal rich objects , with [ fe / h ] between 0.16 and 0.36 , and an average [ fe / h ] equal to 0.26@xmath1260.09 . in figs .",
    "[ subdwbv ] to [ subdwjk ] we compare the cmd of these three subgroups with our isochrones for [ fe / h]=@xmath127 , 0.06 and + 0.26 , respectively .",
    "the comparison is made in the @xmath128 , @xmath115 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath131 planes ; the @xmath132 and @xmath133 magnitudes of the field stars come from the @xmath134 database ( m. groenewegen & s. percival , private communication ) , and have been transformed to our adopted ir system following carpenter  ( 2001 ) . for the sake of comparison",
    "we also show a girardi et al  ( 2000 ) isochrone with [ fe / h]=0.06 .",
    "the agreement between the empirical cmds and the isochrones appears to be satisfactory  in the sense that the theoretical isochrones usually overlap the main cmd locus occupied by the dwarfs in the various metallicity bins and color planes although it tends to deteriorate slightly  apart from the case of @xmath130  at the highest metallicity ( where , however , the star sample is the smallest ) .",
    "we have employed a sample of galactic open clusters of various ages for further tests of the reliability of the magnitudes and colors of our isochrones .",
    "more in detail , we have considered the cmds of the hyades ( pinsonneault et al .",
    "2003 ) , ngc  2420 ( anthony - twarog et al .",
    "1990 ) , m  67 ( sandquist  2004 ) and ngc  188  ( @xmath135 from caputo et al .  1990 , and @xmath136 from von hippel & sarajedini  1998 ) , for which precise parallax - based distance determinations do exist .",
    "in case of the hyades accurate parallaxes of the individual stars in the observed cmd have been determined by the @xmath8 satellite . for the other clusters the distances",
    "have been determined by percival & salaris  ( 2003  ps03 ) using a completely empirical ms - fitting method presented in percival et al .",
    "the ms template sequences used in this technique have been computed making use of the field dwarf sample by percival et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , whose individual [ fe / h ] values are on the same scale of the open cluster metallicities by gratton  ( 2000 ) .",
    "ps03 employed clusters [ fe / h ] estimates from gratton  ( 2000 ) and reddening from twarog et al .  ( 1997 ) .",
    "when we compare our models to the observed cmd of a cluster , we have chosen within our isochrones grid the one with metallicity closest to the cluster [ fe / h ] .",
    "however , if no computed isochrone has a [ fe / h ] value within the quoted 1@xmath85 error associated to the cluster one , we interpolate quadratically within our grid as previously discussed , in order to determine the isochrone with the precise cluster metallicity .",
    "we will consider a fit successful when the theoretical isochrones overlap the main cluster cmd branches for values of reddening , metallicity and distance modulus in agreement with the empirical determinations .",
    "figures  [ hyadesbvi ] and [ hyadesvk ] display the comparison with the hyades cmd corrected for the cluster distance ; the cluster metallicity is [ fe / h]=0.13 according to gratton  ( 2000 ) , and the reddening is zero .",
    "the observed cmd contains exactly the same stars in all three different photometric planes . the interpolated isochrone with [ fe / h]=0.13 that best matches the hyades cmd has an age of 790  myr if overshooting is included , or 560  myr for canonical models ; notice the match ( that in @xmath77 and @xmath81 degrades only when @xmath137 7.5 ) of the unevolved ms to the observed one , without applying any colour shift .",
    "the to region in @xmath138 is however less well reproduced with respect to the @xmath139 cmd , a fact that can be ascribed either to some inconsistencies in the color transformations , or photometric data or a combination of both . in case of ngc  2420 ,",
    "ps03 obtained @xmath140 , assuming [ fe / h]=@xmath380.44 and e@xmath1410.02 ; our interpolated isochrones with [ fe / h]=@xmath380.44 that best match the observed cmd provide a distance modulus @xmath142 and e@xmath77=0.06 , in good agreement with the ms - fitting results ( see fig .  [ 2420bv ] ) .",
    "the age of the best fitting isochron with overshooting is 3.2  gyr , whereas the canonical one has an age of 2  gyr .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the isochrone with overshooting does provide a better match of the observed cmd to region . as for m  67 ,",
    "ps03 have determined a distance modulus @xmath143=9.60@xmath1260.09 , adopting e@xmath77=0.04@xmath1260.02 and [ fe / h]=0.02@xmath1260.06 .",
    "their ms - fitting determination was based on a different @xmath139 photometry ( montgomery et al .",
    "1993 ) , however sandquist  ( 2004 ) has obtained exactly the same distance modulus with his photometry , employing the same method by ps03 and the same [ fe / h ] and e@xmath77 .",
    "we fitted our [ fe / h]=0.06 isochrones to the @xmath139 cluster data , and obtained a successful fit with e@xmath77=0.02 and @xmath143=9.66 , in agreement , within the error bar , with the ms - fitting results .",
    "the result of the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ 67bvi ] . the ms and rgb of the cluster",
    "appear to be matched by both overshooting and canonical isochrones ; also the brightness of the he - burning stars is reproduced .",
    "it is also worth noticing that sandquist  ( 2004 , his fig .",
    "14 ) has shown how a number of isochrones in the literature is unable to fit the main location of the ms for @xmath144 , when the empirical distance , reddening and metallicity are considered ; our isochrones , however , do provide a much better match to this ms region .",
    "the ages of the best fitting isochrones are 4.8 gyr and 3.8 gyr for the overshooting and canonical models , respectively . as already noticed by sandquist  ( 2004 ) who employed the yi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) isochrones , the overshooting models do provide a worse fit to the to region compared to the canonical ones .",
    "the mass evolving at the to of the overshooting isochrone is equal to @xmath91.2  @xmath10 , e.g. , it is in the mass interval where the amount of overshooting is decreasing with mass .",
    "this means that m  67 seem to indicate that the extension of the overshooting region has to be already almost down to zero for masses of @xmath91.2  @xmath10 , at least for metallicities around solar .",
    "figure  [ 67vjk ] shows a comparison between the same isochrones displayed in fig .",
    "[ 67bvi ] and m  67 cmds in near - infrared colors .",
    "subgiants and rgb stars appear to be consistent with our isochrones for the same age , reddening and distance modulus necessary to fit the @xmath139 data , with a small mismatch in the @xmath133 band absolute magnitude of he burning stars .",
    "ps03 have determined for ngc  188 @xmath1450.08 , by using e@xmath1460.02 and [ fe / h]=@xmath1470.06 .",
    "we fitted our interpolated [ fe / h]=@xmath148 isochrones to the observed cmd , in both @xmath128 and @xmath115 ; the successful fit to the whole observed cmd is achieved for an age of 6.3  gyr ( for both isochrones with and without overshooting ) , e@xmath77=0.09 and a distance modulus @xmath143=11.17 , coincident with the empirical ms - fitting result .",
    "figure  [ 188bvi ] shows the result of the fit with theoretical isochrones ; the main location of the ms is reproduced and one can also easily notice that the isochrone with overshooting is only slightly different from the canonical one .",
    "this is due to the fact that the value of the mass evolving at the to region is of about 1.16  @xmath10 , and for these masses the extension of the overshooting region is reducing to zero in our models .",
    "thus , the comparison with ngc  188 does not contradict the possibility , raised by the comparison with m  67 , that the overshooting extension is already reduced to zero when the stellar mass is @xmath149 for metallicities around solar .",
    "we have also compared our isochrones with the deep cmd by kalirai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) of ngc  6819 , a cluster not employed by ps03 ( see fig .  [ 6819bv ] ) .",
    "we have adopted the recent [ fe / h]=0.09@xmath1260.03 determination by bragaglia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and found a a successful fit with our [ fe / h]=0.06 isochrones for e@xmath77=0.14  in perfect agreement with the spectroscopic value e@xmath77=0.14@xmath1260.04 determined by bragaglia et al .",
    "( 2001 )  and a distance modulus @xmath143=12.10 .",
    "the age of the cluster is 3 gyr when overshooting is accounted for , or 1.8 gyr in case of canonical isochrones .",
    "the isochrones overlap the main locus of the cluster ms , and also the brightness of the he - burning clump stars is matched . in this case",
    "the isochrone with overshooting does provide a better match to the to region .",
    "the eclipsing binary star ai  phoenicis is a particularly well suited candidate to test the calibration of the mixing length adopted in our computations , and the amount of overshooting from the convective core .",
    "the eclipsing binary analysis provides extremely precise values for the masses ( 1.190@xmath1260.006 @xmath10 and 1.231@xmath1260.005 @xmath10 ) and radii ( 1.762@xmath1260.007 @xmath150 and 2.931@xmath1260.007 @xmath150 ) of the two components ( milone , stagg & kurucz  1992 ) ; moreover , the metallicity of the system is estimated spectroscopically to be [ fe / h]=@xmath1510.10 by andersen et al .",
    "the less massive component is located right after the to region , at the beginning of the subgiant branch , whereas the more massive star is in a more advanced phase , close to the base of the rgb ; this means that their radii are very sensitive to both the mixing length calibration and overshooting treatment . in fig .",
    "[ aiphe ] we display a comparison on the mass  radius plane between the observed values for the system , and the best match theoretical isochron computed for [ fe / h]=@xmath380.14 ( quadratically interpolated among the available grid of metallicities ) .",
    "both components can be fitted within the extremely small 1@xmath85 error bars with the same age ( approximately the solar age ) and without including overshooting .",
    "isochrones with overshooting can not match simultaneously both components ( an age of 5.37  gyr provides the closest possible match to both components , that is however much worse than the case of canonical isochrones ) , even though , with our prescription , the overshooting region is of about 0.08@xmath29 in this mass range .",
    "this result agrees with the case of m  67 , where we have shown ( in agreement with sandquist  ( 2004 ) results obtained by employing different isochrones ) that masses of @xmath41 have an overshooting region already reduced to virtually zero for metallicities around solar .",
    "we have presented an homogeneous and updated database of stellar evolution models and isochrones for old- , intermediate- , and young stellar populations for a wide range of chemical compositions .",
    "two large grids , with and without the inclusion of convective core overshooting during the h - burning phase are provided .",
    "this set of theoretical models is suitable for population synthesis analysis as well as for investigating evolutionary properties of field and cluster stars in a wide range of masses and chemical compositions .",
    "the main points of this investigation can be summarized as follows :    * our models have been computed making use of many of the most recent updates of the stellar physics inputs . in particular , we employed new improved electron conduction opacities that cover the relevant physical conditions of electron degenerate cores along the rgb ; new homogeneous reaction rates from the nacre compilation , plus the latest determination for the important @xmath18c@xmath19o reaction ; new improved atlas9 color - transformations and bolometric corrections ; new eos that covers homogeneously all the stellar structure along all the relevant evolutionary phases for the entire mass range covered by our computations .",
    "this eos is in extremely good agreement with the opal eos in the common domain of validity , and eliminates the need to match the opal eos to a different one when dealing with he burning and more advanced evolutionary stages . *",
    "the adopted initial he abundance for metal - poor models is in agreement with the most recent evaluations in this field obtained by cmb analysis : this value is also consistent with the estimate obtained from the r - parameter analysis on a large sample of galactic globular clusters , performed with a theoretical calibration consistent with present models .",
    "this consistency is not achieved by the other available databases . *",
    "the results of our calculations allow the computation of grids of isochrones covering a wide range of stellar ages , as well as the estimate of several astrophysical parameters such as the rgb transition mass , the he core mass at the he ignition , the amount of extra - helium dredged up during rgb evolution , the properties of models at the beginning of the thermal pulse phase on the agb or at the carbon ignition ; * we have computed also an additional large set of hb models  starting from a he core mass typical of ages around 13 gyr  for all the metallicities available in our grid , that can be used to produce synthetic hb cmds of various morphologies ;",
    "* stellar models and isochrones have been transferred to several observational cmds by adopting updated bolometric corrections and color - @xmath7 relations , computed specifically for this project , supplemented by empirical color transformation for the lower ms in selected color indices .",
    "the evolutionary tracks and isochrones are normalized in such a way that a simple interpolation on a point by point basis can be used in population synthesis codes to produce isochrones for metallicities intermediate among the values provided in the grid ; * we have shown various comparisons with empirical data for unevolved field ms stars with available @xmath8 precise parallax measurements and metallicity estimates , and with data for open clusters with accurate photometry , metallicity estimates and empirical ms - fitting distances . as a whole",
    ", one can notice that a good agreement has been achieved between theory and observations ; * we have carefully treated the way in which the core overshoot efficiency is decreased when approaching the radiative core regime in low - mass stars .",
    "our analysis of the open cluster m  67 and the eclipsing binary ai phoenicis shows that , at least around solar metallicities , core overshooting efficiency should be reduced to zero already for masses of the order of @xmath152 .",
    "further empirical tests should be performed in order to reach a definitive conclusion on this issue .",
    "we suggest always to compare results obtained with both canonical and overshooting models and isochrones for ages of the order of 4 - 5 gyr .",
    "we have made a large effort in order to make available the whole theoretical framework to the scientific community in a easy and direct way through a dedicated web site .",
    "we plan , in the near future , to prepare a web interactive interface that will allow any potential user to compute isochrones , luminosity functions , synthetic cmds and integrated colors for any specified age and/or star formation history .",
    "the evolutionary database will be soon implemented with a self - consistent and extended set of theoretical models for an @xmath11enhanced heavy element mixture , that will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",

    "<S> we present a large and updated stellar evolution database for low- , intermediate- and high - mass stars in a wide metallicity range , suitable for studying galactic and extragalactic simple and composite stellar populations using population synthesis techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar mass range is between @xmath0 and @xmath1 with a fine mass spacing . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity [ fe / h ] comprises 10 values ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , with a scaled solar metal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the initial he mass fraction ranges from y=0.245 , for the more metal - poor composition , up to 0.303 for the more metal - rich one , with @xmath4 . for each adopted chemical composition , the evolutionary models have been computed without ( canonical models ) and with overshooting from the schwarzschild boundary of the convective cores during the central h - burning phase . </S>",
    "<S> semiconvection is included in the treatment of core convection during the he - burning phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the whole set of evolutionary models can be used to compute isochrones in a wide age range , from @xmath5 myr to @xmath6gyr . both evolutionary models and isochrones are available in several observational planes , employing updated set of bolometric corrections and color-@xmath7 relations computed for this project . </S>",
    "<S> the number of points along the models and the resulting isochrones is selected in such a way that interpolation for intermediate metallicities not contained in the grid is straightforward ; a simple quadratic interpolation produces results of sufficient accuracy for population synthesis applications .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare our isochrones with results from a series of widely used stellar evolution databases and perform some empirical tests for the reliability of our models . since this work is devoted to scaled solar chemical compositions , we focus our attention on the galactic disk stellar populations , employing multicolor photometry of unevolved field main sequence stars with precise @xmath8 parallaxes , well - studied open clusters and one eclipsing binary system with precise measurements of masses , radii and [ fe / h ] of both components . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the predicted metallicity dependence of the location of the lower , unevolved main sequence in the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) appears in satisfactory agreement with empirical data . </S>",
    "<S> when comparing our models with cmds of selected , well - studied , open clusters , once again we were able to properly match the whole observed evolutionary sequences by assuming cluster distance and reddening estimates in satisfactory agreement with empirical evaluations of these quantities .    in general , models including overshooting during the h - burning phase </S>",
    "<S> provide a better match to the observations , at least for ages below @xmath94  gyr . at [ fe / h ] around solar and higher ages ( i.e. smaller convective cores ) before the onset of radiative cores , the selected efficiency of core overshooting may be too high in our as well as in various other models in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> since we provide also canonical models , the reader is strongly encouraged to always compare the results from both sets in this critical age range . </S>"
