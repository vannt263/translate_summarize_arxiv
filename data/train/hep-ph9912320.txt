    "one of the main interests in the top physics studies at the lhc will be an accurate measurement of the top mass .",
    "being a fundamental parameter of the standard model ( sm ) it constraints , along with the w , the higgs mass thus providing an excellent consistency check of the sm .",
    "currently the best tevatron single experiment results on the top mass are obtained with the lepton plus jets final states which yield : m@xmath3 = 175.9 @xmath4 4.8 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath4 5.3 ( syst . )",
    "( cdf )  @xcite and 173.3 @xmath4 5.6 ( stat . ) @xmath4 5.5 ( syst . ) ( d )  @xcite .",
    "the systematic errors in both measurements are largely dominated by the uncertainty on the jet energy scale and amount to 4.4  gev and 4  gev for the cdf and d , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the systematics in di - lepton channels are somewhat less , but the statistical errors are significantly larger , by a factor of @xmath5  2 , as compared to the lepton plus jets final states . in future runs of the tevatron with about 20-fold increase in statistics",
    "the top mass will be measured with an accuracy of @xmath6  2  gev  @xcite ; in the lepton plus jets channel the error is dominated by the systematics while in di - lepton channels the limiting factor would still be statistics .    the legitimate question to ask ",
    "what is the ultimate precision on the top mass that can be attained at the lhc ?",
    "apparently , to significantly improve on jet measurements at lhc would be a challenge .",
    "however , one can take the advantage of large top production rates and explore leptonic final states . in this paper",
    "we consider four- ( three- ) lepton final states involving the j@xmath7@xmath8 decays , see fig .",
    "[ topc2 ] .    here",
    ", the top mass is partially reconstructed by combining the isolated lepton , @xmath9 or e , from the w decays with the j@xmath7from the decays of the corresponding @xmath1-quark , i.  e. reconstructing the lepton plus j@xmath7invariant mass , m@xmath10  @xcite . in order to determine the top decay topology one can require an additional tagging muon - in - jet coming from other @xmath1 .",
    "the branching suppression factor is @xmath11 taking into account the charge conjugate reaction and w  @xmath12  e@xmath13 decays . in spite of rather low branching ratios",
    ", we stress that these final states are experimentally very clean and can be exploited even at highest lhc luminosities .",
    "furthermore , one can also explore an other way to associated the j@xmath7with the corresponding isolated lepton  by measuring the jet charge of identified @xmath1 ( s ) and not requiring the tagging muon . in this case",
    "we gain a factor of more than 10 in statistics as compared to the four - lepton final states .",
    "similar approaches , namely the use of the correlation between the top mass and its decay products , e.  g. in final states with an isolated lepton combined with the muon from the semileptonic decays of the corresponding @xmath1 s , have been explored in earlier studies @xcite .",
    "one should say that all these methods of top mass determination essentially rely on the monte - carlo description of its production and decay .",
    "nonetheless , the model , to a great extent , can be verified and tuned to the data .",
    "in the following we assume the @xmath14production cross - section of 800  pb for m@xmath3 = 175  gev .",
    "events are simulated with the pythia 5.7 @xcite or herwig 5.9  @xcite event generators .",
    "particle momenta are smeared according to parameterizations obtained from detailed simulation of the cms detector performance .",
    "four - lepton events are selected by requiring an isolated lepton of @xmath15 15  gev in central pseudorapidity range of @xmath16 2.4 and three non - isolated , centrally produced muons of @xmath15 4  gev in @xmath16 2.4 , with the invariant mass of the two of them being consistent with the j@xmath7mass .",
    "these cuts would significantly reduce the external ( non-@xmath14 ) background , mainly the w@xmath17 production , process .",
    "pythia results indicate that with the above cuts this source of the background can be kept at a per cent level . ] which can be further reduced by employing , in addition , two central jets from another w , if needed .",
    "resulting kinematical acceptance of the selection criteria is 0.3 ; this rather small value is largely due to soft muons from j@xmath0 and @xmath1 . in one year",
    "high luminosity running of lhc , corresponding to an @xmath18  pb@xmath19 , and assuming the trigger plus reconstruction efficiency of 0.8 , we expect about @xmath20 events .",
    "an example of the @xmath21j@xmath7mass distribution with the expected background is shown in fig .",
    "the background is internal ( from the @xmath14production ) and is due to the wrong assignment of the j@xmath7to the corresponding isolated lepton .",
    "these tagging muons of wrong sign are predominantly originating from @xmath22oscillations , @xmath23 transitions , w@xmath24 decays , @xmath25k decays in flight and amount to @xmath6  30% of the signal combinations .",
    "the shape of the signal @xmath21j@xmath7events ( those with the correct sign of the tagging muon ) is consistent with a gaussian distribution over the entire mass interval up to its kinematical limit of @xmath6  175 gev .",
    "the background shape is approximated by a polynomial function of degree  3 .",
    "the parameters of this polynomial function are determined with `` data '' made of the wrong combinations of @xmath21j@xmath7with an admixture of signal . in such a way",
    "the shape of the background is determined more precisely and in situ .",
    "thus , when the signal distribution is fitted , only the background normalization factor is left as a free parameter along with the three parameters of a gaussian .",
    "the result of the fit is shown in fig .",
    "we point out that this procedure allows to absorb also the remaining external background ( if any ) into the background fit function .    as a measure of the top quark mass we use the mean value ( position of the maximum of the distribution ) of the gaussian , m@xmath26 . in four years running at lhc with high luminosity the typical errors on this variable , including the uncertainty on the background , are about 0.5  gev .",
    "it is composed of @xmath2  0.5  gev statistical error and @xmath2  0.15  gev systematics contribution due to the uncertainty on the measurement of the background shape .",
    "the measurement of the m@xmath26can then be related to the generated top quark mass .",
    "an example of the correlation between the m@xmath27 and m@xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fitl2 ] along with the parameters of a linear fit . for comparison",
    ", we also show the corresponding dependence in a more traditional isolated lepton plus @xmath9-in - jet channel .",
    "not surprisingly , the stronger correlation , and thus a better sensitivity to the top mass , is expected in the @xmath21j@xmath7final states as compared to the isolated lepton plus @xmath9-in - jet channel .",
    "this is because , in the former case , we pickup a heavy object ( i.  e. j@xmath7 ) from the @xmath1-jet which carries a larger fraction of its momentum .",
    "apparently , when determining the top mass , the m@xmath26measurement error , statistical and systematic , would scale up as the inverse slope value of the fit which is a factor of 2 in our case .",
    "hence the statistical error on the top mass in this particular example would be @xmath6  1  gev .",
    "it is appropriate to comment on the ways to obtain a larger event sample .",
    "possibilities might include reconstruction of the j@xmath28  e@xmath29e@xmath30 decays in @xmath1-jets @xcite and/or relaxing the lepton @xmath31 thresholds @xcite .",
    "an even larger event sample can be obtained in three lepton final states , i.  e. without the tagging muon , but using instead the jet charge technique to determine the @xmath14decay topology .",
    "the jet charge is defined as a @xmath31-weighted charge of particles collected in a cone around the j@xmath7direction .",
    "obviously , this kind of analysis requires detailed simulations with full pattern recognition .",
    "however , particle level simulations performed with pythia and with realistic assumptions on track reconstruction efficiency indicate comparable to muon - tag performance figures , but with about 10 times less integrated luminosity . in any case , through the lhc lifetime , one can collect enough events so that the overall top mass measurement accuracy would not be hampered by the lack of statistics ; it would rather be limited by the systematics uncertainties which are tightly linked with the monte - carlo tools in use , as will be argued in the following section .",
    "let us first briefly mention the features of pythia and herwig that are relevant to our analysis .",
    "they both incorporate only the leading order matrix elements for @xmath14production and decay , and simulate the qcd final state effects via parton showers .",
    "this algorithm is not exact at higher orders in @xmath32 but could be , in principle , matched to the next - to - leading order calculations .",
    "both event generators keep track of color connections , however the hadronization is performed in different ways : in pythia ( jetset ) it is done via a string fragmentation model while herwig exploits a cluster hadronization scheme .",
    "eventually , free parameters of these event generators are tuned to reproduce the data , especially from e@xmath29e@xmath30 colliders .",
    "these tunings to data usually include event shape variables , identified particles production rates , their momentum spectra , etc .",
    "an essential aspect of the current analysis is to understand limitations which would arise from the monte - carlo description of the top production and decay .",
    "with pythia we have investigated the following sources of systematic uncertainties on the m@xmath26measurements :    1 .   _ initial state radiation . _ + the m@xmath26value is unchanged even switching the initial state radiation off .",
    "_ final state radiation ( fsr ) .",
    "_ + large shift of @xmath6  7  gev is observed when it is switched off . to evaluate the uncertainty we varied the parton virtuality scale @xmath33",
    " an invariant mass cut - off below which the showering is terminated .",
    "a @xmath450% variation of it around the default ( tuned to data ) value of 1  gev induces an uncertainty of @xmath34  gev .",
    "qed bremsstrahlung .",
    "_ + only a small effect is observed when it is switched off .",
    "furthermore , qed radiation is well understood and can be properly simulated .",
    "4 .   _ parton distribution functions ( pdf ) . _",
    "+ depending on the relative fraction of gluon / quarks versus @xmath35 in various pdfs the top production kinematics might be different .",
    "no straightforward procedure is available for the moment to evaluate uncertainties due to a particular choice of pdf .",
    "here we compare results obtained with the default set cteq2l @xcite and a more recent cteq4l @xcite parameterizations of pdfs .",
    "the observed change in the m@xmath26value is well within 0.1  gev .",
    "_ top @xmath31 spectrum . _",
    "+ one does not expect significant uncertainties associated with the top @xmath31 spectrum , i.  e. its generated shape .",
    "this is primarily due to a good agreement between the parton shower monte - carlos and the next - to - leading order qcd calculations over a wide range of @xmath31 up to 1  tev . in ref .",
    "@xcite this comparison is done with the herwig event generator .",
    "similar results we have obtained also with pythia . however , to see an effect we have artificially altered the top @xmath31 spectrum by applying a cut at the generator level .",
    "for example , a 1@xmath36 effect shows up only when the @xmath37 cut - off pushed up to 100  gev .",
    "_ top and w widths . _ + kinematical cuts that one applies usually affect the observed breit - wigner shape ( tails ) of decaying particles .",
    "conversely , poor knowledge of the widths may alter the generated @xmath21j@xmath7mass spectrum depending on the cuts .",
    "only little change in the m@xmath26value is seen even with the zero - width approximation . 7 .",
    "_ w polarization . _ + a significant shift is found for the isotropic decays of w when compared to the sm expectation of its @xmath38% longitudinal polarization . in future runs of the tevatron the w polarization will be measured with a @xmath39% accuracy @xcite , and at the lhc this would be further improved so that it should not introduce additional uncertainties in simulations .",
    "_ @xmath14spin correlations . _ + a `` cross - talk '' between @xmath40 and @xmath41 decay products is possible due to experimental cuts . to examine this effect in details",
    "the @xmath42 matrix elements have been implemented in pythia preserving the spin correlations  @xcite .",
    "no sizeable difference in the m@xmath26value is seen compared to the default @xmath43 matrix elements .",
    "@xmath1 fragmentation , except fsr .",
    "_ + as a default , in pythia we have used the peterson form for the @xmath1-quark fragmentation function with @xmath44 .",
    "variation of this value by @xmath410%  @xcite leads to an uncertainty of @xmath45 gev .",
    "_ background .",
    "_ + the uncertainty would be mainly due to an inaccurate measurement of the background shape and the systematics contribution of @xmath2  0.15  gev quoted in previous section would scale down with increasing statistics .",
    "for example , already with @xmath46 events the induced uncertainty is @xmath2  0.1  gev .",
    "_ detector resolution . _",
    "+ here we have considered only gaussian smearing of particle momenta and the effect on the m@xmath47 measurement uncertainty is negligible .",
    "a possible nonlinearity of the detector response can be well controlled having a huge sample of j@xmath0 , y and z leptonic decays that will be available at lhc .",
    "a summary of these studies is given in fig .",
    "one sees an impressive stability of results for reasonable choices of parameters .",
    "the expected systematic error in the m@xmath26determination is @xmath2  @xmath48  gev which translates into a systematic error on the top mass of @xmath49m@xmath50  @xmath51  gev .",
    "another way to estimate systematics uncertainties could be by a comparison of pythia and herwig expectations .",
    "with herwig we have tried various tunings from lep experiments as well as its default settings listed in table  [ hwset ] .",
    "they all yield comparable results to each other and to pythia results , and are within @xmath2  0.5  gev .",
    "this corresponds to a systematic uncertainty @xmath49m@xmath52  1  gev .    .herwig",
    "parameter settings @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one more feature specific to top decays is related to the matrix element corrections to parton shower simulations  @xcite . a significant shift is observed in the mean value of the isolated lepton plus @xmath53-hadron invariant mass spectra when these corrections are implemented in herwig  @xcite . on the other hand , this shift does not necessarily induces an additional systematic error ( which is at least partially accounted for in 2  the fsr effects ) once it is properly taken into account .",
    "further studies are required when the corresponding implementation is publicly made available .",
    "abundant production of top quarks at lhc allows to use leptonic final states to precisely determine the top quark mass thus avoiding limitations that are ultimately associated to measurements with jets .    1 .   in @xmath21j@xmath0 final states",
