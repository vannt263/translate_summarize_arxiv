    "the quantum many - body problem , with its many , rich manifestations in condensed matter physics , has had a long and illustrious history . in particular , superconductivity and superfluidity",
    "were two major discoveries in this field .",
    "although at present much is well understood ( e.g. , the bcs theory of superconductivity ) , the recent experimental discoveries of bose - einstein condensation in laser - cooled atoms  @xcite raises new and interesting questions , such as whether the observed bose - einstein condensates are superfluids , or whether persistent currents can exist in these new states of matter .    historically speaking , in the study of the interaction of light with matter , most of the emphasis has been on exploring new states of matter , such as the recently observed atomic bose - einstein condensates . however , not as much attention has been focused on exploring new states of light . of course , the invention of the laser led to the discovery of a new state of light , namely the coherent state , which is a very robust one .",
    "two decades ago , squeezed states were discovered , but these states are not as robust as the coherent state , since they are easily degraded by scattering and absorption .",
    "in contrast to the laser , which involves a system far away from equilibrium , we shall explore here states close to the ground state of a photonic system .",
    "hence they should be robust ones .",
    "here we shall study the many - body problem by studying the interacting many - photon system ( the `` photon fluid '' ) near its ground state .",
    "in this paper we shall explore some theoretical considerations which suggest the possibility of a new state of light , namely , the superfluid state .",
    "in particular , we shall derive the bogoliubov dispersion relation for the weakly - interacting photon gas with repulsive photon - photon interactions , starting both from the microscopic ( i.e. , second - quantized ) level , and also from the macroscopic ( i.e. , classical - field ) level .",
    "thereby we shall find an expression for the effective chemical potential of a photon in the photon fluid , and shall relate the velocity of sound in the photon fluid to this nonvanishing chemical potential . in this way , we lay the theoretical foundations for an experiment in progress to measure the sound - wave - like dispersion relation for the photon fluid .",
    "we also propose another experiment to measure the critical velocity of this fluid , and thus to test for the possibility of the superfluidity of the resulting state of the light .    although the interaction hamiltonian used in this paper is equivalent to that used earlier in four - wave squeezing , we emphasize here the many - body , collective aspects of the problem which result from multiple photon - photon interactions .",
    "this leads to the idea of the `` photon fluid . ''",
    "since the microscopic and macroscopic analyses yield the same bogoliubov dispersion relation for excitations of this fluid , it may be argued that there is nothing fundamentally new in the microscopic analysis given below which is not already contained in the macroscopic , classical nonlinear optical analysis .",
    "however , it is the microscopic analysis which leads to the new , heuristic viewpoint of the interacting photon system as a `` photon fluid , '' a conception which could give rise to new ways of understanding and discovering nonlinear optical phenomena .",
    "furthermore , the interesting question of the quantum optical state of the light inside the cavity resulting from multiple interactions between the photons ( i.e. , whether it results in a coherent , squeezed , fock , or some other quantum state ) , can not be addressed by classical nonlinear optical methods .",
    "thus this paper represents a first attempt to formulate the new concept of a `` photon fluid '' starting from the microscopic viewpoint , and to lay the foundations for answering the question concerning the resulting quantum optical state of the light .",
    "here we re - examine one particular many - body problem , the one first solved by bogoliubov  @xcite .",
    "suppose that one has a zero - temperature system of bosons which are interacting with each other repulsively , for example , a dilute system of small , bosonic hard spheres .",
    "such a model was intended to describe superfluid helium , but in fact it did not work well there , since the interactions between atoms in superfluid helium were too strong for the theory for be valid . in order to make the problem tractable theoretically , let us assume that these interactions are weak . in the case of light ,",
    "the interactions between the photons are in fact always weak , so that this assumption is a good one .",
    "however , these interactions are nonvanishing , as demonstrated by the fact that photon - photon collisions mediated by atoms excited near , but off , resonance have been experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "we start with the bogoliubov hamiltonian @xmath0 where the operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 are creation and annihilation operators , respectively , for bosons with momentum @xmath3 , which satisfy the bose commutation relations @xmath4 = \\delta_{pq}\\mbox { and } [ a_{p},a_{q } ] =   [ a_{p}^{\\dagger},a_{q}^{\\dagger } ] = 0\\,.\\ ] ]    the first term @xmath5 in the hamiltonian represents the energy of the free boson system , and the second term @xmath6 represents the energy of the interactions between the bosons arising from the potential energy @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction term is equivalent to the one responsible for producing squeezed states of light via four - wave mixing  @xcite .",
    "it represents the annihilation of two particles , here photons , of momenta @xmath3 and @xmath8 , along with the creation of two particles with momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 , in other words , a scattering process with a momentum transfer @xmath11 between a pair of particles with initial momenta @xmath3 and @xmath8 , along with the assignment of an energy @xmath7 to this scattering process .",
    "photons with momenta @xmath3 and @xmath8 also obey the above commutations relations , so that the bogoliubov theory should in principle also apply to the weakly - interacting photon gas .",
    "the factor @xmath12 represents the energy as a function of the momentum ( the dispersion relation ) for the free , i.e. , noninteracting , bosons . in the case of photons in a fabry - perot resonator , the boundary conditions of the mirrors cause the @xmath12 of a photon trapped inside the resonator to correspond to an energy - momentum relation which is identical to that of a nonrelativistic particle with an effective mass  @xcite of @xmath13 .",
    "this can be understood starting from fig .",
    "[ fabry - perot ] .    for high - reflectivity mirrors ,",
    "the vanishing of the electric field at the reflecting surfaces of the mirrors imposes a quantization condition on the allowed values of the @xmath14-component of the photon wave vector , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an integer , and @xmath17 is the distance between the mirrors .",
    "thus the usual frequency - wavevector relation @xmath18^{1/2}\\,,\\ ] ] upon multiplication by @xmath19 , becomes the energy - momentum relation for the photon @xmath20^{1/2 } =   c[p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}+\\hbar^{2}n^{2}\\pi^{2}/l^{2}]^{1/2 } = c[p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}+m^{2}c^{2}]^{1/2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the effective mass of the photon . in the limit of small - angle ( or paraxial ) propagation , where the small transverse momentum of the photon satisfies the inequality @xmath22^{1/2}\\ll",

    "it is convenient to redefine the zero of energy , so that only the effective kinetic energy , @xmath25 remains . to establish the connection with the bogoliubov hamiltonian",
    ", we identify the two - dimensional momentum @xmath26 as the momentum @xmath3 that appears in this hamiltonian , and the above @xmath27 as the @xmath12 that appears in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "now we know that in an ideal bose gas at absolute zero temperature , there exists a bose condensate consisting of a macroscopic number @xmath28 of particles occupying the zero - momentum state .",
    "this feature should survive in the case of the weakly - interacting bose gas , since as the interaction vanishes , one should recover the bose condensate state . hence following bogoliubov , we shall assume here that even in the presence of interactions , @xmath28 will remain a macroscopic number in the photon fluid@xcite .",
    "this macroscopic number will be determined by the intensity of the incident laser beam which excites the fabry - perot cavity system , and turns out to be a very large number compared to unity ( see below ) . for the ground state wave function @xmath29 with @xmath28 particles in the bose condensate in the @xmath30 state ,",
    "the zero - momentum operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 operating on the ground state obey the relations @xmath33 since @xmath34 , we shall neglect the difference between the factors @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "thus one can replace all occurrences of @xmath31 and @xmath32 by the @xmath37-number @xmath36 , so that to a good approximation @xmath38\\approx 0 $ ] .",
    "however , the number of particles in the system is then no longer exactly conserved , as can be seen by examination of the term in the hamiltonian @xmath39 which represents the creation of a pair of particles , i.e. , photons , with momenta @xmath11 and @xmath40 out of nothing .",
    "however , whenever the system is open one , i.e. , whenever it is connected to an external reservoir of particles which allows the total particle number number to fluctuate around some constant average value , then the total number of particles need only be conserved on the average . formally ,",
    "one standard way to compensate for the lack of exact particle number conservation is to use the lagrange multiplier method and subtract a chemical potential term @xmath41 from the hamiltonian ( just as in statistical mechanics when one goes from the canonical ensemble to the grand canonical ensemble )  @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total number operator , and @xmath44 represents the chemical potential , i.e. , the average energy for adding a particle to the open system described by @xmath45 . in the present context",
    ", we are considering the case of a fabry - perot cavity with low , but finite , transmissivity mirrors which allow photons to enter and leave the cavity , due to an input light beam coming in from the left and an output beam leaving from the right .",
    "this permits a realistic physical implementation of the external reservoir , since the fabry - perot cavity allows the total particle number inside the cavity to fluctuate due to particle exchange with the beams outside the cavity .",
    "however , the photons remain trapped inside the cavity long enough so that a thermalized condition is achieved after many photon - photon interactions ( i.e. , after many collisions ) , thus allowing the formation of a photon fluid",
    ". it will be useful to separate out the zero - momentum components of the interaction hamiltonian , since it will turn out that there is a macroscopic occupation of the zero - momentum state due to bose condensation .",
    "the prime on the sums @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 in the following equation denotes sums over momenta explicitly excluding the zero - momentum state , i.e. , all the running indices @xmath3 , @xmath49 , @xmath8,@xmath50,@xmath51 which are not explicitly set equal to zero , are nonzero : @xmath52\\right)+\\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\sum_{p\\kappa } } ' v(\\kappa ) \\left(a_{p+\\kappa   } ^{\\dagger}a_{0}^{\\dagger}a_{p}a_{\\kappa } + a_{p+\\kappa   } ^{\\dagger}a_{-\\kappa } ^{\\dagger}a_{p}a_{0}\\right )   + \\frac{1}{2}{\\sum_{\\kappa pq}}'v(\\kappa ) \\left(a_{p+\\kappa   } ^{\\dagger } a_{q-\\kappa } ^{\\dagger}a_{p}a_{q}\\right)\\ , .",

    "it may be asked why the classical nonlinear optical calculation gives the same result as the quantum many - body calculation .",
    "one answer is that one expects classical sound waves to have the same dispersion relation as phonons in a quantum many - body system : there exists a classical , correspondence - principle limit of the quantum many - body problem , in which the collective excitations ( i.e. , their dispersion relation ) do not change their form in the classical limit of large phonon number .",

    "a single quantum of any elementary excitation can not exist with a velocity below that of the sound wave .",
    "hence no excitation of the superfluid at zero temperature is possible at all for any object moving with a velocity slower than that of the sound wave velocity , according to an argument by landau  landau .",

    "this light produces a uniform flow field of the photon fluid , which flows inside the resonator in some transverse direction and at a speed determined by the incidence angle .",
