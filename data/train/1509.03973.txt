    "quantum langevin equation ( qle ) provides a direct depiction of the temporal behaviors of physical observables under the influence of a bath of quantum particles  @xcite . as such",
    ", qle has many important applications in quantum optics @xcite , the input - output theory  @xcite , and the quantum dynamics of dissipative atoms  @xcite . for deriving a generic langevin equation , however ,",
    "markovian approximation was usually employed to arrive at a tractable equation of motion .",
    "qle beyond markovian approximation can be also formulated to study the intriguing non - markovian dynamics of damped quantum systems and the brownian motion systems .",
    "a method@xcite based on the mori expansion@xcite can solve these kind of problems conveniently .",
    "the main idea of this method is to expand the time dependent operator with a set of time independent basis operators .",
    "this set of basis and the corresponding coefficients are govern by two recurrence relations .    in the last decade , the so - called non - markovian quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) equation  @xcite has been formulated nonperturbatively , so it can apply to the cases with strong couplings between systems and environments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the non - markovian qsd has provided a powerful tool in numerically simulating many interesting physical models @xcite . in particular ,",
    "high - order numerical methods for the non - markovian qsd  @xcite have been developed very recently , making some previously intractable problems becoming numerically tractable .",
    "in fact , the qsd equation is a stochastic schrdinger equation and it is solved by invoking the noise realizations . for the important case of spin - boson model @xcite ,",
    "however , matters are not as simple as the form of this model due to the fact that the spin - boson model does not admit an analytical treatment and an efficient numerical simulation is prohibited without including the higher - order perturbations @xcite .    in this paper , we develop a stochastic quantum langevin approach to solving non - markovian quantum dynamics of the spin - boson model .",
    "this model which is the multi - mode case of the quantum rabi model@xcite involves non - conserving processes due to the counter - rotating terms .",
    "consequently , it poses a long - standing difficult problem in studying non - markovian quantum dynamics  @xcite . by projecting the non - markovian qle onto the coherent states of the bath , we convert the operator qle into a c - number stochastic qle , which is formally analogous to the non - markovian qsd equation . therefore , the useful techniques developed for the qsd can apply to the c - number stochastic qle as well",
    "remarkably , we find that the stochastic qle can be further reduced to a set of simple non - markovian quantum bloch equations without involving any noise variables .",
    "this provides a much more efficient method to solve the non - markovian quantum dynamics of the spin - boson model .",
    "as shown below , the method developed here is quite general , so it may offer significant numerical advantages for simulating open quantum systems coupled to bosonic environments when higher - order perturbation is unavoidable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we obtain a stochastic qle by projecting the non - markovian qle onto the coherent states of the bosonic bath .",

    "<S> one long - standing difficult problem in quantum dissipative dynamics is to solve the spin - boson model in a non - markovian regime where a tractable systematic master equation does not exist . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - boson model is particularly important due to its crucial applications in quantum noise control and manipulation as well as its central role in developing quantum theories of open systems . </S>",
    "<S> here we solve this important model by developing a non - markovian quantum langevin approach . by projecting the quantum langevin equation onto the coherent states of the bath </S>",
    "<S> , we can derivie a set of non - markovian quantum bloch equations containing no explicit noise variables . </S>",
    "<S> this special feature offers a tremendous advantage over the existing stochastic schrdinger equations in numerical simulations . the physical significance and generality of our approach </S>",
    "<S> are briefly discussed . </S>"
