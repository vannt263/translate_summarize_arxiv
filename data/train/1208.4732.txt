    "during last decade the lda+dmft method ( local density approximation + dynamical mean - field theory ) became probably the most powerful tool to calculate electronic structure of real strongly correlated materials [ ] .",
    "typically this approach consists of two computation steps .",
    "first , lda calculations are exploited to obtain the non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath6 which describes , rather accurately , the kinetic energy ( and to some extent takes into account electronic interactions ) . at the second step",
    "the local coulomb ( hubbard ) interaction @xmath7 is introduced into the lattice problem defined by @xmath6 for those electronic shells which are supposed to be strongly correlated .",
    "thus obtained generalized hubbard model is solved numerically using dmft . some attempts to organize a feedback from dmft step back to lda calculations to achieve fully self - consistent lda+dmft",
    "are also known and may be important for some physical problems [ ] .",
    "the double counting problem arises in the standard lda+dmft , because some portion of local electron - electron interaction for correlated shells is actually accounted for within @xmath6 . to avoid this double counting",
    "it is necessary to subtract a certain correction term @xmath8 from @xmath6 .",
    "then the formal lda+dmft hamiltonian is written as : @xmath9 in orbital space @xmath8 is the diagonal matrix with non zero and equal matrix elements for these atomic shells assumed to be strongly ( e.g. @xmath1 or @xmath10 shells or their subshells ) .",
    "this becomes more transparent if we consider the corresponding green s function for the hubbard model : @xmath11^{-1 } , \\label{dyson_for_dmft}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the unity matrix in the orbital space , @xmath13 is the chemical potential and @xmath14 is the self - energy corresponding to local coulomb ( hubbard ) interaction , @xmath15^{-1}$ ] denotes matrix inversion , while index @xmath1 denotes correlated states for which coulomb ( hubbard ) interaction is taken into account .    from eq .",
    "one can see that in case of @xmath6 containing only the contribution of interacting @xmath1 - orbitals , @xmath16 reduces to trivial renormalization of the chemical potential @xmath13 .",
    "then , strictly speaking , there is no double counting problem at all . because of this many of early works ( listed e.g. in reviews [ ] , except probably the first paper on lda+dmft  [ ] and few others ) just dropped the double counting correction term .",
    "only after the lda+dmft community started the active studies of multiband @xmath6 hamiltonians with both correlated and non correlated states included , the problem of correct implementation of @xmath8 became important .",

    "to derive an expression for @xmath8 let us examine @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms eq .  .",
    "lda part of the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath21where @xmath22 is the laplace operator , @xmath23 the electron mass , @xmath24 the electron charge , and @xmath25 denote the one - particle potential due to all ions @xmath26 with charges @xmath27 at given positions @xmath28 , and the electron - electron interaction , respectively .",

    "the explicit expression for @xmath29 is usually derived from perturbation theory [ ] or numerical simulations [ ] of the `` jellium '' model with @xmath31 . to obtain the value of local charge density one should choose some basis set of one - particle wave functions @xmath32 ( e.g. to do practical calculations and explicitly express matrix elements of the hamiltonian ) , so that @xmath33 is written as : @xmath34 @xmath35 one can get numerically exact solution of the hubbard hamiltonian ( simplified kinetic term plus @xmath7 term ) within dmft approximation .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath36 contains local electron - electron correlations through the exchange correlation energy ( taken in the form valid for uniform electronic gas ) and density - density contribution of the hartree term . in its turn",
    ", dmft provides the numerical solution of the hubbard model ( exact in infinite dimensions ) .",
    "thus it is clear that before plugging @xmath36 into dmft lattice problem , one must subtract certain double counting correction term @xmath8 from @xmath36 .",
    "the double counting _ problem _ arises because there is no explicit microscopic or diagrammatic relation between the model ( hubbard like ) hamiltonian approach and lda .",
    "is apparently no possibility to give a rigorous expression for @xmath8 in terms of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "several @xmath40 expressions for @xmath8 and approaches to the double counting problem exist in the current literature .",
    "below we briefly discuss some of these derivations .",
    "@xmath41 the drawback of amf is the equal occupancy of all orbitals which is not correct even for weakly correlated systems because e.g. of crystal field splitting . however , a couple of the modern lda+dmft works reported the reasonable results with amf - like double counting correction term . apparently , the amf double counting correction works rather well for moderately correlated metallic systems",
    ". some modifications of were given in refs .",

    "was introduced in refs .",

    "it works reasonably good for both metallic and insulating strongly correlated materials .",
    "recently some modifications of fll were proposed in refs .",
    "typically these modifications are used to quantitative improvements of lda+dmft results for particular compounds .",
    "some kind of amf and fll `` hybrid scheme '' was used in ref .",
    "[ ] for @xmath43 .",
    "alternative way to derive or guess the @xmath8 term is to express it through the characteristics of intrinsic single dmft impurity problem , such as impurity self - energy @xmath44 or impurity green s function @xmath45 . a popular way is to define double counting energy as a static part of the impurity self - energy [ ] : @xmath46some of lda+dmft papers used this definition in calculations of metallic magnetic and non - magnetic systems . from the very",
    "beginning this type of double counting correction was also exploited within the gw+dmft approach [ ] .",
    "hartree energy can be determined from lda+dmft self - energy as its real part in the high frequency limit value . in ref .",
    "[ ] it was proposed to use thus defined hartree energy as a double counting correction , using the constraint @xmath47where @xmath48 is the highest matsubara frequency ( used in calculations ) .",
    "physically similar definition of double counting term @xmath49 was successfully applied to metallic ferromagnetic srcoo@xmath2 [ ] .",
    "for metallic systems it was suggested to fix the double counting correction by equating the number of particles of non - interacting problem and impurity problem as expressed via corresponding green s function [ ] : @xmath50 some of lda+dmft works treated double counting energy @xmath16 as a free parameter .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] found that most of described @xmath8 terms proposed in the literature are not completely satisfactory in the case of charge transfer insulator nio and proposed a _ numerical _ way to define the necessary double counting correction .",
    "another possible solution of the double counting problem is to perform hartree+dmft or hartree - fock+dmft calculations [ ] . while performing hartree - fock band structure calculations for real materials we do know exactly what portion of interaction is included .",
    "since diagrammatic expression for hartree or hartree - fock terms are well known , one can calculate them directly and get double counting correction energy explicitly .",
    "however , up to now we are unaware of any hartree+dmft or hartree - fock+dmft calculations for real materials .",
    "completely independent branch of _ ab initio _ dmft calculations is gw+dmft method , which uses instead of density functional theory the so called chain of hedin equations truncated in a simplest manner by the neglect of vertex corrections ( for review see ref .  [ ) ] . because of purely diagrammatic nature of gw there is a natural way to calculate the local part of corresponding hartree contribution , which can be used as the double counting correction term for gw+dmft .",
    "recently we proposed the lda@xmath0+dmft approach , which defines consistent parameter free way to avoid the double counting problem [ ] .",
    "the main idea is to exclude explicitly exchange - correlation energy from self - consistent lda calculations only for correlated bands .",
    "as described above main obstacle to express double counting term exactly is exchange correlation @xmath29 portion of interaction within lda .",
    "so it seems somehow inconsistent to use it to describe correlation effects in narrow ( strongly correlated ) bands from the very beginning , as these should be treated via more elaborate schemes like dmft . to overcome this difficulty for these states",
    ", we propose to redefine charge density ( [ rhophi ] ) in @xmath52 as follows : @xmath53 _ excluding the contribution of the density of strongly correlated electrons_.    in principle @xmath52 is not an additive function of charge density .",
    "thus splitting of charge density into two parts may lead to some loss of hybridization between correlated and uncorrelated states .",
    "however as we show below this approximation is rather good .",
    "later on we will see that lda@xmath0 bands practically do not change their shape with respect to lda ones for all considered systems .",
    "that tells us that `` hybridization '' is almost not affected by lda@xmath0 .",
    "the main effect is increase of splitting between oxygen 2p and metal 3d states .",
    "it comes from more repulsive potential appearing in the lda@xmath0 case since part of exchange correlation energy is excluded there .",
    "then this redefined @xmath54 ( [ rhophi1 ] ) is used to obtain @xmath55 and perform the self - consistent lda@xmath0 band structure calculations for correlated bands .",
    "this procedure leaves out of interaction for correlated states on the lda@xmath0 stage just the hartree contribution ( [ hlda0 ] ) .",
    "thus , double counting correction term should be consistently taken in the form of the hartree like term , given by eq .",
    "( [ eldau ] ) .",
    "this @xmath56 definition also does not have any free parameters . actually , our approach is in precise correspondence with the standard definition of correlations , as interaction corrections `` above '' the hartree - fock . at the same time",
    "all other states ( not counted as strongly correlated ) are to be treated with the full power of dft / lda and _ full _ @xmath39 in @xmath52 .    despite the fact that the lda@xmath0+dmft method is apparently most consistent with the use of fll type of double counting , in principle",
    "all mentioned above definitions of @xmath57 can also be exploited within lda@xmath0+dmft .",
    "also there is another `` degree of freedom left ''  the occupancy @xmath58 , used in fll equation , can be obtained either from lda or lda@xmath0 results , or it can be calculated self consistently during the dmft loop .",

    "most figures presented below are plotted for the fll(sc ) case .",
