    "we will firstly consider the case of two generations of neutrinos in matter . in the basis of flavor ,",
    "the evolution equation of a neutrino in the 2-dimensional flavor space takes @xcite the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the numerical density of electrons , @xmath5 is fermi s constant , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the mixing angle in vacuum , the one and only parameter of the @xmath8 mixing matrix for 2 generations . at any moment ,",

    "in order to solve eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) we need to diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "it is easy to show that , for constant @xmath14 , the oscillation probabilities are ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath19 , which are : @xmath20    this solution means that neutrinos in matter of constant density oscillate in a sinusoidal way , like in vacuum , while the amplitude and wavelength of oscillation in matter are different from those in vacuum .",

    "when @xmath4 tends to @xmath22 , then @xmath21 also tends to @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "an important result of this solution is that oscillation amplitude can be either enhanced of suppressed with respect to oscillation in vacuum , due to matter effects .",
    "this may be demonstrated by ranging @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ tan ] ) from @xmath22 to @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath26 we have @xmath27 , which means zero amplitude , suppression of oscillation .",
    "there is only one value of @xmath21 which maximizes amplitude by giving @xmath28 .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ msw - resonance _ @xcite and happens when : @xmath29    regarding the wavelength of oscillation @xmath30 , for zero @xmath4 it equals @xmath31 while for @xmath32 it tends to zero .",
    "as neutrinos travel through celestial bodies and other objects , they cross regions of extremely high and extremely low electron densities . thus , solving eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) for constant @xmath4 does not help much .",
    "but when @xmath4 is a function of position is a function of position , but for neutrinos traveling at ( almost ) the speed of light , it is convenient to replace @xmath33 with the neutrino time of flight @xmath34 , using natural units where @xmath35 . ] @xmath36 , then eq.([evolution ] ) gets extremely complicated and can only be solved numerically .",
    "either numerically or analytically , solutions of eq.([evolution ] ) give us the amplitudes @xmath37 and @xmath38 as functions of time .",
    "those amplitudes are _ complex _ numbers , but we usually express the solution in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , as done in eq .",
    "( [ probs ] ) , because we have a more intuitive understanding of those probabilities .",
    "however , as it will have been explained by the end of this article , the complex nature of these amplitudes is important and my lead to observable phenomena .",
    "when @xmath4 varies , @xmath41 and @xmath42 may vary in a chaotic fashion , depending on the density profile @xmath43 , the initial conditions @xmath44 , the energy @xmath45 of the neutrino and the input parameters @xmath7 and @xmath46 .",
    "an example of such an irregular oscillation can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "nevertheless , in space ( time ) intervals where @xmath4 does not change very rapidly , the approximation of constant @xmath4 holds well and oscillation patterns in those regions look like those of eq .",

    "( b ) : the resulting survival probability of a neutrino which initially was a pure @xmath9 .",
    "we can see the region of suppression at the center of the density distribution .",
    "we have assumed e=3 gev , @xmath47 , @xmath48.,height=377 ]    another thing that should be noticed is that msw - resonance may occur instantly if the density profile has not been adjusted so as to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ msw ] ) for long intervals . on the other hand ,",
    "suppression is observed for @xmath49 , which holds for a whole range of density values , not just for a specific @xmath4 .",
    "so , if things have not been intentionally set up to be different , suppression is a phenomenon which may last for longer and is more probable than msw - resonance .",
    "equation ( [ evolution ] ) is a system of _ complex _ differential equations and its solutions are complex functions of time , as stated earlier .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath51 and @xmath52 affect the real and imaginary parts of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    as for every differential equation , the solution of eq.([evolution ] ) depends on the initial condition @xmath55 , which involves @xmath56 and @xmath57 as _ complex _ numbers : @xmath58 starting from the same @xmath59 and different @xmath60 leads to completely different solutions @xmath61 , even in vacuum makes no difference , and this case is the one nature always prefers . ] .",
    "however , people do nt pay much attention to the arguments @xmath60 .",
    "the reason is that neutrinos are always produced in weak vertices .",
    "all experiments show that weak bosons @xmath62 couple with neutrinos in eigenstates of flavor .",
    "thus , all neutrinos start their journey from the initial condition : @xmath63 equivalently : @xmath64    of course , initial condition ( [ natural_condition ] ) says nothing about the arguments @xmath60 .",
    "they can take any value .",
    "but if they are arbitrary and also drastically affect @xmath65 , then experiments should have observed extremely messy oscillations , different for identical neutrinos with only different @xmath60 . the reason that this is _",
    "not _ what happens is that the impact of @xmath60 on @xmath65 is canceled when eq .",
    "( [ natural_condition ] ) holds , which means always .",
    "it can be proved analytically and also be tested numerically .    in brief , _",
    "neutrinos are eigenstates of flavor , not of mass , and that is why they oscillate .",
    "that is also why @xmath60 have no observable effect . _",
    "there are at least two methods to find the condition of non - oscillation of neutrinos in vacuum .",
    "the brute one is to solve analytically eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) with the most general expression of initial conditions , find the expression for @xmath65 in terms of the initial conditions and then demand that @xmath66 .",
    "this demand imposes a condition to the initial conditions which , if satisfied , guarantees constancy does not mean constancy of the solution @xmath67 , but only of @xmath68 . in the complex plane , @xmath69 and @xmath52 always rotate .",
    "] of @xmath65 .",
    "constancy of @xmath65 is also guaranteed if the neutrino initially is in an eigenstate of _ mass _ , because @xmath70 so , assuming definite momentum @xmath71 , definite mass means definite energy @xmath45 , which means constant state .",
    "so , the second , equivalent but much more elegant method to find the condition of non - oscillation is to demand that initially the neutrino has definite mass .    for two generations",
    ", the mixing of flavor and mass eigenstates is given by the expression : @xmath72 @xmath73 with @xmath74    demanding that initially @xmath75 , ( [ norms=1 ] ) and ( [ mix ] ) give the condition : @xmath76    demanding that initially @xmath77 , from ( [ norms=1 ] ) and ( [ mix ] ) we find : @xmath78    conditions ( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) do not only refer to the amplitudes of @xmath50 , but also to the relationship of their arguments @xmath60 , so the complex nature of @xmath9 and @xmath11 can not be marginated and consider only @xmath59 .",
    "for ( [ condition1 ] ) to be satisfied , @xmath9 and @xmath11 must be in the same direction on the complex plane ( homoparallel ) , while ( [ condition2 ] ) demands them to point in opposite directions ( antiparallel ) .",
    "@xmath7 is the only parameter in both non - oscillation conditions .",

    "on the other hand , if we initially select @xmath80 and @xmath81 to satisfy one of the non - oscillation conditions , then the ellipses take the shape of the black circles of fig . 3 and @xmath33 and @xmath82 keep revolving coherently , being always collinear .",

    "black circles are the same we had in fig .",
    "[ fig2].,height=264 ]",
    "non - oscillation in vacuum would only be fiction , if matter effects were not capable of achieving the non - oscillation condition , because nature produces neutrinos obeying eq.([natural_condition ] ) , which contradicts ( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) .    numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ evolution ] ) with variant @xmath4 has revealed that the trajectories of @xmath33 and @xmath82 in the complex plane get extremely complicated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and _ can _ happen to satisfy one of the non - oscillation conditions , even instantaneously .",
    "in other words , a neutrino in matter may transiently get into a mass eigenstate .    from the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we realize that , as density increases and then decreases , @xmath90 and @xmath91 drift away from the ellipsoidal trajectories they initially followed in vacuum .",
    "when density becomes zero again , they return to elliptical trajectories which are different from those they initially followed when in vacuum .",
    "the reason is that the neutrino returned to vacuum from different initial conditions , i.e.  the @xmath33 and @xmath82 it had at the moment it exited the matter region .",
    "the most critical interval is while the neutrino lies in the middle of the matter region , where its oscillation is highly suppressed .",

    "if @xmath4 rises appropriately and diminishes at the right time , then it is possible to make @xmath90 and @xmath91 satisfy ( or almost satisfy ) one of the non - oscillation conditions .",
    "after methodically trying several initial conditions ( always obeying eq.([natural_condition ] ) ) and several @xmath4 shapes , i found one example of such a ` flavor lens ' .",
    "the neutrino was assumed to initially have @xmath95 , @xmath96 and energy e=3 gev .",

    "5 , together with the oscillation of survival probability of a @xmath9 passing through it .",
    "@xmath99 rises according to the function : @xmath105 with @xmath106    the fact that i found this specific density profile does not mean that it is the only ` flavor lens ' for this kind on neutrinos . the same distribution , with its center @xmath107 translated by an integer number of vacuum wavelengths @xmath31 , would have the same result . whether a density profile is a flavor lens or not depends on its position with respect to neutrino s production point , on neutrino s energy , on its shape and on the initial conditions of the neutrino @xmath108 .    it has been tested and confirmed that @xmath60 do not affect the oscillation through the flavor lens , as long as ( [ natural_condition ] ) was initially true . in the same way that ( [ natural_condition ] ) ` hides ' the impact of @xmath60 in oscillations in vacuum , it also also prevents the role of @xmath60 from being revealed when matter is present .",

    "it demands three complex numbers to be collinear in the complex plane , to point in the right directions and to be of the right sizes .",
