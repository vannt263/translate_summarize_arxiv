    "we fixed the value of @xmath166 fm and diffuseness parameter @xmath167 vary from @xmath168 fm in our calculations .",
    "7 represents the calculated values of @xmath11 , @xmath17 and @xmath169 for the @xmath2al projectile .",
    "the upper panel of this figure represents the root mean square radius @xmath169 for @xmath2al of core + nucleon system , where as middle panel show @xmath17 and lower panel @xmath170 for @xmath2al+@xmath1c reactions at energy 30 and 74 mev / nucleon respectively as a function of diffuseness parameter ` a ' in fm .",
    "we have taken care to fit the reaction cross section for @xmath2al at different values of diffuseness parameter .",
    "it is observed from the figure that both reaction cross section and diffuseness parameter are linearly dependent to each other .",
    "the values of @xmath11 obtained at diffuseness parameter = 2 fm are 1950 and 1537 mb , for incident energy 30 and 74 mev / nucleon respectively , where as the experimental values 1946@xmath161172 and 1609@xmath16179 mb .",
    "therefore , the calculated value of reaction cross section fit with the experimental data at a = 2 fm as shown in figure 7 .",
    "unlike the total reaction cross - section , the @xmath17 obtained from the glauber model depends very much on the structure information of the projectile and target nuclei , i.e. input densities of these systems .",
    "the proton removal reaction cross - section of @xmath2al is 64 mb at 74 mev / nucleon , which is well comparable with the predictions of frag et al . @xcite i.e the data of 63@xmath171 mb , larger than its neighbours , suggesting a weak binding of the last proton and extended valence density distribution .",
    "we also found the value of root mean square radius of @xmath2al ( core + nucleon ) at a = 2 fm is 4.908 fm .",
    "thus the large value of reaction cross section due to extended matter density distribution for @xmath2al isotope also supported our previous observations of halo status of such nuclei .",
    "8 represents the variation of @xmath11 and @xmath17 in mb as a function of projectile energy over the energy range 30 - 1000 mev / nucleon for diffuseness 2 fm .",
    "the upper panel of the figure consists total , elastic and inelastic components of the @xmath17 cross section with available data .",
    "the elastic differential cross sections as a function of angular distribution for both @xmath10 mg core and @xmath2al halo projectiles on the carbon target at @xmath150= 74 mev / nucleon is shown in fig .",
    "9 . there are two dip - positions at angles near about @xmath172 = @xmath173 and within @xmath174 .",
    "it is also observed that shifting of the dip takes place more for @xmath2al at lower angle as compared to @xmath10 mg .",
    "this figure shows clear oscillatory pattern in which magnitude of oscillations are large at smaller angles and keep on decreasing with increase in angles at @xmath150= 74 mev / nucleon .",
    "+    mg from the @xmath2al+@xmath1c reaction at projectile energy 74 mev / nucleon .",
    "the experimental data are also given for comparison.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig.1 ]      the estimated longitudinal momentum distribution for @xmath10 mg core of the reaction @xmath2al+@xmath1c at @xmath175=74 mev / nucleon is represented in fig .",
    "10 along with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the momentum distributions are estimated by glauber many body model for diffuseness values of 0.6 and 2.0 fm .",
    "the calculated values of momentum distributions underestimate the experimental value .",
    "so we have scaled the calculated values to central experimental data point for comparison of both distributions .",
    "this figure also signifies that momentum distributions match reasonably with experimental data .",
    "the width of this distribution is appeared narrow in comparison to experiment @xcite due to large skin .",
    "the gaussian fit of full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of momentum distribution are found to be 140.02369@xmath176 mev / c for 0.6 fm and 98.607 @xmath161 0.12",
    "mev / c for 2.0 fm , where as experimental result of frag et al .",
    "@xcite is 232@xmath177 mev / c .",
    "in summary , the bulk properties like be , @xmath19 and @xmath20 for various isotopes of al upto the drip - line regions are studied using rmf(nl3 ) formalism .",
    "these results are reasonably agreed with experimental data .",
    "the one and two proton / neutron separation energy of these nuclei are also explained .",
    "relatively , smaller value of one proton separation energy and other properties of @xmath2al indicates its halo nature .",
    "the total nuclear reaction cross - sections @xmath11 for projectiles @xmath0al and @xmath1c as target have been calculated in the glauber model using the densities obtained from rmf(nl3 ) approximation",
    ". the @xmath11 are in good agreement with the experiments , when we consider the deformation effect in the densities for isotopic chains .",
    "the enhanced reaction cross section of @xmath2al at low energy and extended density distribution which seems justified from higher value rms radius as compared to its neighbouring nuclei indicates the existence of halo structure .",
    "higher value of difference factor ` @xmath155 ' for @xmath2al quantitatively explains its halo structure .",
    "narrow width in longitudinal momentum distribution also indicates halo structure of @xmath2al .",
    "similar results for @xmath178 as ref .",
    "@xcite also supports halo nature of @xmath2al .",
    "more investigations are needed to find specific information regarding the structure of @xmath2al .",
