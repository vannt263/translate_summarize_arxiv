    "<S> , which is due to the fact that the scaling of the vertex and the @xmath43-factors is completely different around the fixed points compared with the scaling at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> our results are further substantiated by bare perturbation theory up to @xmath123 @xcite , which confirms that there are no logarithmic terms @xmath124 in the time dynamics , consistent with eqs .   </S>",
    "<S> [ note that @xmath125 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now sketch the derivation of our results . </S>",
    "<S> first we note that the full effective liouvillian is decomposed as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the part which arises from integrating out the symmetric part of the reservoir contractions . </S>",
    "<S> the other parts can be parametrized in the following way : @xmath128 as a consequence , the full propagator can be written as @xmath129 , with @xmath130 . in leading order , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath131 can be neglected and the correction from @xmath132 influences only the stationary state ( [ eq : st ] ) and the pole contribution ( [ eq:1p ] ) . the liouvillian @xmath54 has four eigenvalues @xmath133 , @xmath134 and , neglecting @xmath135 , @xmath136 , with corresponding projectors given by @xmath137 the jump of the liouvillian across the branch cuts needed for the evaluation of ( [ eq : bc ] ) is parametrized as @xmath138 in leading order , we obtain the following rg equations for @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141:@xcite @xmath142 the rg equations are coupled to the renormalization of the vertex function @xmath143 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions at @xmath144 are @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of these rg equations is very different for high and low energies . for energies </S>",
    "<S> @xmath148 we find @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 . according to our general analysis , </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to the universal shorttime behavior @xmath152 which agrees with previous predictions.@xcite in contrast , around the fixed points we find a different scaling . </S>",
    "<S> close to @xmath98 , we get @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> close to @xmath158 , we obtain @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath156 , and @xmath162 . inserting these results in the general expressions ( [ eq : bp ] ) and ( [ eq : bc ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the results ( [ eq : rho_tot]-[eq : f_t ] ) using straightforward algebra . </S>",
    "<S> as we can see , the most important point is that the vertex function @xmath163 is approximately a constant for high energies , whereas , at low energies , @xmath164 is nearly a constant . </S>",
    "<S> if one makes a mistake and takes @xmath165 for _ all _ energies , one would obtain the scaling @xmath166 , which produces the incorrect niba result @xmath167 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if one neglects the renormalization of @xmath164 and takes it as a constant , one obtains the correct scaling for long times but the scaling of the @xmath43-factors at high energies will change with the consequence of an incorrect description of the dynamics at short times . therefore , for a proper description of the time dynamics on _ all _ time scales , it is crucial to take the vertex renormalization into account .    _ summary and outlook . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have shown that the long - time behavior of open quantum systems involves logarithmic corrections which are generically quite different from those at short and intermediate times . </S>",
    "<S> for weak - coupling problems we propose a perturbative rg method in liouville space with a complex flow parameter where these corrections can be calculated from a systematic expansion around the fixed points . </S>",
    "<S> we applied the theory to the ohmic spin boson model and found indeed a different long - time behavior than previously predicted . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since certain terms of the rg flow are only cut off by the scale @xmath14 of the inverse time but not by decay rates @xmath168 : it is not guaranteed for all models that the rg flow stays in the weak - coupling regime close to the fixed points irrespective the size of @xmath168 . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent example of such behavior is the antiferromagnetic nonequilibrium kondo model at bias voltage @xmath169 much larger than the kondo temperature @xmath170 , which has been shown to be a weak - coupling problem for the determination of stationary quantities . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , by using the e - rtrg method of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , it turns out that the renormalized vertices become strong for @xmath13 close to the fixed points @xmath171 , although @xmath168 is much larger than the kondo temperature @xmath170 , whereas they stay small for @xmath13 close to zero ( which sets the point to determine stationary quantities ) . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , the long - time behavior can not be calculated from a weak - coupling analysis but a strong - coupling analysis is needed , which goes beyond the perturbative rg method presented in this work and poses new interesting problems for the future . </S>",
    "<S> other interesting situations arise when one of the poles @xmath24 is equal to zero and is a branching pole , i.e. , when there is no exponential decay but a nontrivial preexponential function with logarithmic scaling . </S>",
    "<S> this happens typically for problems with quantum critical behavior or for reservoirs with a nonanalytic spectral density in the limit @xmath172 , e.g. , for multichannel kondo or sub - ohmic spin boson models . </S>",
    "<S> such systems are of particular interest since the long - time behavior is no longer suppressed by the exponential decay and the logarithmic scaling behavior becomes more visible .    </S>",
