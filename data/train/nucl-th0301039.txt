    "nuclear reactions using rare isotopes has opened up several new frontiers in nuclear sciences@xcite . in particular ,",
    "high energy heavy rare isotopes to be available at the future rare isotope accelerator ( ria ) and the new gsi accelerator facility provide a unique opportunity to explore novel properties of dense neutron - rich matter that was not in reach in terrestrial laboratories before .",
    "this exploration will reveal crucial information about the @xmath2 of neutron - rich matter . to understand the latter and its astrophysical implications , such as , the origin of elements , structure of rare isotopes and properties of neutron stars are presently among the most important goals of nuclear sciences .",
    "the @xmath2 of neutron - rich matter of isospin asymmetry @xmath3 can be written as @xmath4 within the parabolic approximation ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath5 is the energy per nucleon in isospin symmetric nuclear matter and @xmath6 is the symmetry energy at density @xmath7 . to study the @xmath6 has been a longstanding goal of extensive research with various microscopic and/or phenomenological models over the last few decades .",
    "the predicted results on the density dependence , especially at high densities , are extremely diverse and often contradictory .",
    "theoretical results can be roughly classified into two groups , i.e. , a group where the @xmath6 rises monotonously and one in which it falls with the increasing density above about twice the normal nuclear matter density . above @xmath8 ,",
    "even the sign of the symmetry energy is unclear .",
    "the fundamental cause of the extremely uncertain hd behaviour of @xmath6 is the complete lack of terrestrial laboratory data to constrain directly the model predictions .",
    "recently , several promising observables were proposed to extract the hd behavior of the symmetry energy using high energy radioactive beams@xcite .",
    "in a neutron star , several of its main properties are affected significantly by the correlation between the density and the proton fraction @xmath9 at @xmath10 equilibrium .",
    "the latter is determined by@xcite @xmath11 the equilibrium proton fraction is therefore entirely determined by the @xmath6 .",
    "we use the following two representatives of the symmetry energy @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the values of @xmath14 corresponding to these two forms of symmetry energy are shown in the insert of fig .  1 .",
    "with the @xmath15 , the @xmath16 is @xmath17 for @xmath18 , indicating that the neutron star has become a pure neutron matter at these high densities . on the contrary , with the @xmath19 , the neutron star becomes more proton - rich as the density increases . to see the connection between the physics governing properties of both neutron stars and heavy - ion collisions , we show in fig .",
    "1 the correlation between density @xmath7 and the isospin asymmetry @xmath20 ( effective isospin asymmetry taking into account different charge states of @xmath21 resonances ) over the entire reaction volume at the time of about the maximum compression in the central @xmath22 reactions with e / a=400 ( upper window ) and 2000 ( bottom window ) mev / nucleon , respectively .",
    "these results were obtained using an isospin - dependent hadronic transport model@xcite .",
    "the overall rise of @xmath23 at low densities is mainly due to the neutron skins of the colliding nuclei and the distillated neutrons .",
    "effects due to the different symmetry energies are more clearly revealed especially at high densities .",
    "an astonishing similarity is seen in the resultant @xmath24 correlations for the neutron star and the heavy - ion collision . in both cases ,",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath25 makes the hd nuclear matter more neutron - rich than the @xmath26 and the effect grows with the increasing density .",
    "of course , this is no surprise since the same underlying nuclear @xmath2 is at work in both cases .",
    "the decreasing @xmath25 above @xmath27 makes it more energetically favorable to have the denser region more neutron - rich in both neutron stars and heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath28 ratio in heavy - ion collisions depends strongly on the isospin asymmetry of the reaction system .",
    "it is also qualitatively easy to understand why this dependence can be used to extract crucial information about the eos of neutron - rich matter . on one hand , within the @xmath29 resonance model for pion production from first - chance independent nucleon - nucleon collisions@xcite ,",
    "the primordial @xmath28 ratio is @xmath30 .",
    "it is thus a direct measure of the isospin asymmetry @xmath31 of the dense matter in the participant region of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath31 is uniquely determined by the high density behaviour of the nuclear symmetry energy@xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath28 ratio can be used to probe sensitively the eos of neutron - rich matter . on the other hand , within the statistical model for pion production@xcite ,",
    "the @xmath28 ratio is proportional to @xmath32 $ ] , where t is the temperature , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the chemical potentials of neutrons and protons , respectively . at modestly high temperatures ( @xmath35 mev )",
    ", the difference in the neutron and proton chemical potentials can be written as@xcite @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the coulomb potential for protons , @xmath38 is the thermal wavelength of a nucleon and @xmath39s are the inversion coefficients of the fermi distribution function .",
    "the difference in neutron and proton symmetry potentials @xmath40 , where the function @xmath41 is completely determined by the density - dependence of the symmetry energy@xcite",
    ". it is seen that the kinetic part of the difference @xmath42 relates directly to the isospin asymmetry @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "thus within the statistical model too , the @xmath28 ratio is sensitive to the @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath28 ratio is affected by the competition of the symmetry and coulomb potentials which all depend on the isospin asymmetry of the reaction system . at relatively low temperatures",
    "there is a good chance to extract crucial information about the symmetry potential .    shown in fig .  2 are the isospin asymmetry of the high density region @xmath45 ( left ) and the @xmath46 ratio ( right ) @xmath47 as a function of time for the central @xmath22 reaction at beam energies from 200 to 1000 mev / nucleon .",
    "this ratio naturally becomes the final @xmath28 ratio at the freeze - out when the reaction time @xmath48 is much longer than the lifetime of the delta resonance @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath46 ratio is rather high in the early stage of the reaction because of the large numbers of neutron - neutron scatterings near the surfaces where the neutron skins of the colliding nuclei overlap .",
    "it is seen that a variation of about 30% in the @xmath50 due to the different @xmath6 results in about 15% change in the final @xmath28 ratio .",
    "it has thus an appreciable response factor of about 0.5 to the variation of hd",
    "n / p ratio and is approximately beam energy independent .",
    "therfore , the @xmath46 ratio is a sensitive probe of the hd behaviour of nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the neutron - proton differential collective flow is measured by@xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the total number of free nucleons at the rapidity @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the transverse momentum of particle @xmath55 in the reaction plane , and @xmath56 is @xmath57 and @xmath58 for neutrons and protons , respectively . the free nucleons are identified as those having local nucleon densities less than @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath60 combines constructively the in - plane transverse momenta generated by the isovector potentials while reducing significantly influences of the isoscalar potentials of both neutrons and protons .",
    "thus , it can reveal more directly the hd behaviour of @xmath6 in high energy heavy - ion collisions . a typical analysis for mid - central @xmath22 reactions at 400",
    "mev / nucleon is made in the upper window of fig .",
    "a clear signature of the hd behaviour of @xmath6 appears at both forward and backward rapidities .",
    "the slope @xmath61 at mid - rapidity is different by about a factor of 2 in reactions at @xmath62 mev / nucleon as shown in the lower window of fig .",
    "this large effect can be easily observed by using available detectors at several heavy - ion facilities in the world .",
    "in summary , the hd behaviour of nuclear symmetry energy has been puzzling physicists for decades . in this work ,",
    "central collisions induced by high energy radioactive beams are proposed as a novel means to solve this longstanding problem . within an isospin dependent hadronic transport model using two representative density dependent symmetry energy functions predicted by many body theories ,",
    "several experimental probes for the hd symmetry energy are studied . among them , the @xmath28 ratio , neutron - proton differential collective flow and its excitation function are found most promising .",
    "future comparisons between the experimental data and model calculations will constrain stringently the hd behaviour of nuclear symmetry energy ."
