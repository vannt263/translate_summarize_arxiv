    "the collapse of the core of a massive star is believed to lead to the explosion of a type ii supernova .",
    "so far , however , numerical simulations of such a collapse have not been able to demonstrate convincingly the explosions observed in nature .",
    "such simulations require many detailed and complex physical inputs , such as the equation of state of dense and warm stellar matter , the hydrodynamics of the shock wave , or the energy transport by neutrinos .",
    "the calculation of the equation of state of the stellar core material at densities below the nuclear saturation densities ( @xmath6 g/@xmath1 ) constitutes , technically , one of the most computer intensive parts , because it requires a high accuracy due to its influence on the early part of the supernova development ( see e.g. cooperstein & baron 1990 ) .    initially , at densities of @xmath7",
    "g/@xmath1 the core is composed of heavy nuclei immersed in a electrically neutral plasma of electrons , with a small fraction of drip neutrons and an even smaller fraction of drip protons .",
    "nevertheless , the overall density being much lower than nuclear matter density , the average volume available to a single nucleus is much greater than that of the nuclear volume . under such circumstances",
    "the equation of state can be approximated by that of a boltzmann gas of heavy nuclei , and drip particles in nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , together with a highly degenerate , electrically neutralizing gas of non - interacting electrons .",
    "this state of affairs persists up to densities of @xmath8 , where the ratio of the nuclear radius ( @xmath9 ) to the coulomb interaction radius ( @xmath10 ) given by @xmath11 is no longer small @xmath12 and the nuclei start interacting with each other by means of coulomb lattice effects . finally , at values around @xmath13 the density of the `` vapor '' of free nucleons surrounding the droplets of nuclear matter is too high to justify the treatment of nuclei as a boltzmann gas of _ non - interacting _ particles ( see e.g. hillebrandt ( 1994 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the equation of state of moderately neutron - rich matter at intermediate temperature and density can substantially influence the energy spectrum and the flux of the early phase neutrinos from electron capture on nuclei and free protons .",
    "should the neutrinos from the collapse phase be detected from a nearby supernova in an underground neutrino detection experiment such as the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) or the super - kamioka ( sk ) , such spectra could be possibly measured .",
    "this will be possible only under the assumptions , that such a supernova explosion will occur at a distance of approximately 1 kpc and that these new generation of neutrino detectors with increased sensitivity are available at that time ( see sutaria & ray ( 1997 ) , hereafter sr ) .",
    "the neutrinos from the early phase of the collapse , before they are trapped by dense overlying matter are especially interesting for several reasons .",
    "they bear information directly related to the conditions under which they are produced ( sr ) .",
    "the pre - trapping phase of the emission of core - neutrinos continues until the overlying density grows to about @xmath14 g/@xmath15 .",
    "the emitted neutrino spectrum depends upon the individual @xmath16-values @xmath17 of the nuclei involved in the electron - capture reaction .",
    "both these @xmath16-values as well as the overall abundance of particular nuclei depend upon the binding energies of these nuclei . as the electron capture on protons has different neutrino emission characteristics than the capture on nuclei , the emitted spectra will be different for different admixtures of these components .",
    "the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) controls the heights and the centroids of the neutrino spectrum such as the example shown in fig [ fig1 : 25msmhv2 ] .",
    "this example was computed using the eos , in particular the expressions for nucleonic chemical potentials as given by fuller ( 1982 ) .    during the collapse",
    ", it depends also on the entropy of the core whether most of the electron captures occur on free protons or on heavy nuclei . at relatively low entropies ( e.g. @xmath18 ) captures on heavy nuclei dominate the total rate .",
    "such entropies of the core do occur for stars of main sequence mass 10 - 25 @xmath19 .",
    "as the entropy connected with nuclear excitations and the entropy of the free nucleons form a significant part of the total entropy of the stellar core , this forms another reason for evaluating the nuclear properties of the stellar core with accuracy .",
    "the relevant temperature range of the stellar core is approximately 0.2 to 1.5 mev at such low entropies for a density range of @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath14 g/@xmath1 .",
    "investigations on the equation of state of supernova matter have by now spanned several decades ( bethe et al .",
    "1979 , hereafter bbal ; lamb et al . 1978 , hereafter llpr78 ; lattimer et al .",
    "1985 , hereafter lprl85 ; lamb et al .",
    "1983 , hereafter llpr83 ) .",
    "at the same time , ever since the discovery of neutron stars as pulsars more than thirty years ago , work on the equation of state of  cold , catalyzed \" matter , i.e. matter at zero temperature and under thermodynamic equilibrium , has been pursued by a number of scientists ( see pethick & ravenhall 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the equation of state of hot supernova matter has been in many ways an extension of the early work done on the eos of neutron star matter at zero temperature ( baym et al . 1971a (",
    "bps ) ; baym et al .",
    "1971b ( bbp ) ) .",
    "since these investigations were based on the liquid drop mass formulae of myers & swiatecki ( 1966 ) , the calculations of the equations of state for supernova have also followed largely this semi - empirical approach .",
    "more recent attempts of the eos of supernova matter by swesty et al .",
    "( 1994 ) are based on the finite temperature , compressible liquid droplet model which attempts to take into account the nucleon - nucleon interaction in analogy to the density dependent skyrme type energy functionals . on the other hand , there are microscopic investigations based on the hartree - fock or on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov scheme with effective nucleon - nucleon interactions , such as that of negele & vautherin ( 1973 ) above the neutron drip point or that of haensel et al .",
    "( 1989 ) below the neutron drip point .",
    "however , as far as pre - supernova conditions are concerned , the liquid - drop ( or droplet ) based versions of the eos can not be applied so easily because in this temperature range ( 0.2 to 1.5 mev ) shell and pairing effects dominate the nuclear structure .",
    "it is only at temperatures beyond @xmath20 mev , that nuclei can be dealt within the liquid drop approximation .",
    "thus an equation of state which is used to calculate nuclear properties in the pre - supernova stage should take into account  microscopic \" shell and pairing effects . at higher temperatures and densities ,",
    "well after neutrino trapping at @xmath21 they should smoothly go over into the high - temperature high - density eos based on the liquid drop model of nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore the computation of the eos by theoretical methods needs to be supplemented by experimental data and their trends .    in this context , we note the work of el eid & hillebrandt ( 1980 ) ( hereafter eh ) which computed the equation of state of supernova matter and made use of the so called droplet model ( dm ) and its extension .",
    "the dm model was an early attempt which went beyond the conventional liquid drop model ( ldm ) also due to myers & swiatecki ( 1966 ) with the inclusion of a shell correction term due to von groote et al .",
    "the ldm was used for the eos computations of much of the subsequent works mentioned below .",
    "the droplet model is an analytical extrapolation of the thomas fermi model .",
    "von groote et al . also gave a new fit to the dm parameters to all nuclear masses known at that time .",
    "in this paper , we present a microscopic calculation based on a suitably generalized relativistic mean field theory adapted to the stellar collapse problem ( we refer also to sutaria ( 1997 ) , ray et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and sutaria et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ) .",
    "this automatically accounts for the nucleon - nucleon interactions and for shell and pairing effects , and as we show later reproduces the currently known nuclear masses with substantial accuracy .",
    "a microscopic approach like this is expected to be more reliable for nuclei relevant in the astrophysical context , which are often very neutron rich and are thus far from the valley of @xmath22-stability .    in section [ sec : preceos ] we summarise the existing equations of state based on the liquid drop approach ; this helps to establish the notation and to compare with previous approaches . in section [ sec : rmfapp ] we describe the relativistic mean field theory calculations as adapted to the supernova context . in this section",

    "[ sec : comp ] we compare our results with those of liquid drop based models and compare with the earlier work of cooperstein and baron ( 1990 ) and references therein . in section [ sec : finitetemp ] we describe the generalization to finite temperature and discuss the modification of our results due to low but finite temperature effects . in the concluding section [ sec : summ ]",
    "we make a comparison with the results of eh and ours at the initial stage of stellar collapse and summarize our conclusions .",
    "the initial efforts to compute the eos , and indeed most of the literature available so far on the eos of supernovae concentrate mainly on matter at densities beyond @xmath23 g/@xmath1 .",
    "most of them are based on the liquid drop model of the nucleus , as the initial work of bbal , llpr and their co - workers .",
    "later finite temperature extensions of the existing eos as for instance the work of baron et al .",
    "( 1985 ) ( hereafter bck ) and cooperstein ( 1985 ) took into account the nuclear compressibility .",
    "the most sophisticated attempts in developing an equation of state at higher temperatures and higher densities , close to nuclear saturation densities , have been finite temperature hartree fock calculations , as those of bonche & vautherin ( 1981 ) .",
    "these hartree - fock approaches rely on the spherical approximation and on phenomenological models for the nuclear potentials , usually of skyrme type , which are fitted carefully to properties of finite nuclei .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the composition of stellar matter at densities between @xmath24 and @xmath14 g/@xmath1 and at temperatures between @xmath25 and @xmath26 mev can be approximated by a soup of nuclei including drip neutrons , protons , alpha - particles and an ensemble of heavy nuclei .",

    "the fraction of drip nucleons remains low during the collapse until nuclei merge into a uniform nucleon sea , possibly through a bubble phase .",
