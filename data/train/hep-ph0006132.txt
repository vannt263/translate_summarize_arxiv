    "although the discovery of cp violation goes back to 1964 @xcite , so far this phenomenon has been observed only within the neutral @xmath9-meson system , where it is described by two complex quantities , called @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are defined by the following ratios of decay amplitudes : @xmath12 while @xmath13 parametrizes `` indirect '' cp violation , originating from the fact that the mass eigenstates of the neutral kaon system are not cp eigenstates , the quantity re@xmath14 measures `` direct '' cp violation in @xmath15 transitions .",
    "the cp - violating observable @xmath10 plays an important role to constrain the unitarity triangle @xcite and implies in particular a positive value of the wolfenstein parameter  @xmath16 . in 1999",
    ", new measurements of re@xmath14 have demonstrated that this observable is non zero , thereby excluding `` superweak '' models of cp violation @xcite : @xmath17 unfortunately , the calculations of re@xmath14 are very involved and suffer at present from large hadronic uncertainties @xcite . consequently , this observable does not allow a powerful test of the cp - violating sector of the sm , unless the hadronic matrix elements of the relevant operators can be brought under better control .    in order to test the sm description of cp violation ,",
    "the rare decays @xmath18 and @xmath19 are more promising and may allow a determination of @xmath20 with respectable accuracy @xcite .",
    "yet it is clear that the kaon system by itself can not provide the whole picture of cp violation , and therefore it is essential to study cp violation outside this system . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath0-meson decays appear to be most promising .",
    "in order to determine the angles of the unitarity triangles shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ut ] , and to test the sm description of cp violation , the major role is played by non - leptonic @xmath0 decays , which can be divided into three decay classes : decays receiving both `` tree '' and `` penguin '' contributions , pure `` tree '' decays , and pure `` penguin '' decays .",
    "there are two types of penguin topologies : gluonic ( qcd ) and electroweak ( ew ) penguins .",
    "because of the large top - quark mass , also ew penguins play an important role in several non - leptonic @xmath0-decay processes @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple and interesting situation arises if we restrict ourselves to decays of neutral @xmath21-mesons ( @xmath22 ) into cp self - conjugate final states @xmath23 , satisfying the relation @xmath24 . in this case",
    ", the corresponding time - dependent cp asymmetry can be expressed as @xmath25,\\label{ee6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the mass difference between the @xmath21 mass eigenstates , and the @xmath27 denote their decay widths , with @xmath28 . in eq .",
    "( [ ee6 ] ) , we have separated the `` direct '' from the `` mixing - induced '' cp - violating contributions , which are described by @xmath29 respectively . whereas the width difference @xmath30 is negligibly small in the @xmath31 system , it may be sizeable in the @xmath32 system ( for a recent calculation , see @xcite ) , thereby providing the observable @xmath33 essentially all the information needed to evaluate the cp asymmetry ( [ ee6 ] ) is included in the following quantity @xcite : @xmath34 where the @xmath35 denote hadronic matrix elements of certain four - quark operators , the label @xmath36 distinguishes between @xmath37 and @xmath38 transitions , and @xmath39 is related to the weak @xmath40@xmath41 mixing phase . in general , the quantity @xmath42 suffers from hadronic uncertainties , which are due to the hadronic matrix elements @xmath35 .",
    "however , if the decay @xmath43 is dominated by a single ckm amplitude , the corresponding matrix elements cancel , and the convention - independent observable @xmath42 takes the simple form @xmath44,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is a weak decay phase , which is given by @xmath46      the most important application of the simple formalism discussed above is the decay @xmath48 , which is dominated by the @xmath49 ckm amplitude ( for a detailed discussion , see @xcite ) , implying @xmath50\\,.\\ ] ] another non - trivial prediction of the sm is vanishingly small direct cp violation .",
    "since ( [ ee10 ] ) applies with excellent accuracy to @xmath48  the point is that penguins enter essentially with the same weak phase as the leading tree contribution ",
    "it is referred to as the `` gold - plated '' mode to determine the ckm angle @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "first attempts to measure @xmath20 through the cp asymmetry ( [ e12 ] ) were already performed @xcite : @xmath52 although the experimental uncertainties are still very large , it is interesting to note that these results favour the sm expectation of a _ positive _ value of @xmath20 @xcite . in the @xmath0-factory era ,",
    "an experimental uncertainty of @xmath53 seems to be achievable , whereas second - generation experiments of the lhc era aim at @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this tremendous experimental accuracy raises the question of hadronic uncertainties due to penguin contributions .",
    "an interesting channel in this context is @xmath55 , allowing us to control the  presumably very small  penguin effects in the determination of @xmath56 from @xmath57 , and to extract the ckm angle @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "if this mode would not receive penguin contributions , its mixing - induced cp asymmetry would allow a measurement of @xmath59 : @xmath60=-\\sin(2\\alpha).\\ ] ] however , this relation is strongly affected by penguin effects , which were analysed by many authors @xcite .",
    "there are various methods to control the corresponding hadronic uncertainties .",
    "unfortunately , these strategies are usually rather challenging from an experimental point of view .",
    "the best known approach was proposed by gronau and london @xcite .",
    "it makes use of an @xmath61 isospin relation between the @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath63 decay amplitudes , as well as their cp conjugates , which can be represented as two triangles in the complex plane .",
    "unfortunately , the gronau ",
    "london approach suffers from a serious experimental problem , since the measurement of @xmath64 is very difficult .",
    "alternative methods to control the penguin uncertainties in the extraction of @xmath65 from @xmath3 are very desirable .",
    "an important one for the @xmath66@xmath67 @xmath0-factories is provided by @xmath68 modes @xcite . here",
    "the isospin triangle relations are replaced by pentagonal relations , and the corresponding approach is rather complicated . as we will see in more detail below , an interesting strategy for hadron machines to employ the cp - violating observables of @xmath3 is offered by @xmath4 , allowing a simultaneous determination of @xmath51 and @xmath58 without any penguin uncertainties @xcite .      since the @xmath66@xmath67 @xmath0-factories operating at @xmath69 are not in a position to explore the @xmath32 system , it is of particular interest for hadron machines .",
    "there are important differences to the @xmath31 system : the @xmath70@xmath71 mixing phase @xmath72 is negligibly small in the sm , and a large mixing parameter @xmath73 is expected .",
    "moreover , the expected sizeable width difference @xmath74 provides interesting strategies to extract ckm phases from `` untagged '' @xmath32 data samples , where the rapid oscillating @xmath75 terms cancel @xcite . among the @xmath32 benchmark modes",
    "are @xmath76 , allowing a theoretically clean determination of the ckm phase @xmath77 @xcite , and @xmath78 .",
    "this decay offers interesting strategies to extract @xmath79 , @xmath74 and @xmath80 from the angular distribution of the @xmath81\\,\\phi[\\to k^+k^-]$ ] decay products @xcite .",
    "since @xmath78 modes exhibit , moreover , very small cp - violating effects in the sm , they represent an interesting probe for new - physics contributions to @xmath70@xmath71 mixing @xcite .",
    "since there are no mixing effects present in charged @xmath0-meson decays , non - vanishing cp asymmetries @xmath82 would give us unambiguous evidence for `` direct '' cp violation in the @xmath0 system .",
    "such cp asymmetries arise from the interference between decay amplitudes with both different cp - violating weak and different cp - conserving strong phases . in the sm ,",
    "the weak phases are related to the phases of the ckm matrix , whereas the strong phases are induced by fsi processes . in general , the strong phases introduce severe theoretical uncertainties into the calculation of @xmath82 , thereby destroying the clean relation to the cp - violating weak phases .    an important tool to overcome these problems is provided by amplitude relations between certain non - leptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the prototype of this approach , which is due to gronau and wyler @xcite , uses @xmath83 decays .",
    "if the @xmath84-meson is observed as a cp eigenstates , amplitude triangles can be construced , allowing a theoretically clean determination of @xmath58 . unfortunately ,",
    "these triangles turned out to be highly stretched , and are  from an experimental point of view  not very useful to determine @xmath58 .",
    "further difficulties were pointed out in @xcite . as an alternative , the decays @xmath85",
    "were proposed @xcite because the triangles are more equilateral . but all sides are small because of various suppression mechanisms . in another paper , the triangle approach to extract @xmath58 @xcite was also extended to the @xmath86 system @xcite . at first sight , here",
    "everything is completely analogous to @xmath87 .",
    "however , there is an important difference @xcite : in the @xmath88 system , the amplitude with the rather small ckm matrix element @xmath89 is not colour suppressed , while the larger element @xmath90 comes with a colour - suppression factor .",
    "therefore , the two amplitudes are similar in size ! in contrast to this favourable situation , in the @xmath87 system , the matrix element @xmath89 comes with the colour suppression factor , resulting in a very stretched triangle , while in the decays @xmath91 , all amplitudes are colour suppressed .",
    "decays of the type @xmath92  the @xmath93-spin counterparts of @xmath88  can be added to the analysis , as well as channels , where the @xmath94- and @xmath95-mesons are replaced by higher resonances . at the lhc ,",
    "one expects about @xmath96 untriggered @xmath86s per year of running .",
    "provided there are no serious experimental problems , the @xmath97 approach should be very interesting for the corresponding @xmath0-physics programme .      in order to obtain direct information on @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath2 decays are very promising @xcite , and have received a lot of attention during the recent years @xcite . because of the small ratio @xmath98 , these modes are dominated by penguin topologies and are hence very sensitive to new - physics contributions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , already cp - averaged @xmath2 branching ratios may imply highly non - trivial constraints on @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "so far , the studies of these bounds have focussed on the following two systems : @xmath99 , @xmath100 @xcite , and @xmath101 , @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that also the neutral decays @xmath99 and @xmath102 may be very interesting in this respect @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 strategies to probe @xmath58 make use of flavour - symmetry arguments ( @xmath61 or @xmath103 ) , and rely , in addition , on dynamical assumptions , concerning mainly the smallness of certain rescattering processes , such as @xmath104 .",
    "the theoretical understanding of such fsi processes is poor at present @xcite .",
    "however , there are important experimental indicators for possible large rescattering effects , e.g.  @xmath105 or @xmath106 , and methods to include them in the strategies to probe @xmath58 .    in order to constrain @xmath58 through @xmath2 decays ,",
    "the key quantities are ratios @xmath107 of cp - averaged branching ratios , which can be constructed for the `` mixed '' , charged and neutral @xmath2 systems listed above . employing the theoretical ingredients sketched in the previous paragraph , we obtain @xmath108 where @xmath109 denotes the ratio of ew penguins to trees , @xmath110 is the ratio of trees to qcd penguins , and @xmath111 is the cp - conserving strong phase between tree and qcd penguin amplitudes .",
    "whereas @xmath109 can be fixed through theory , and @xmath110 with the help of additional experimental information , e.g.  on br@xmath112 , @xmath111 suffers from large hadronic uncertainties and is essentially unknown .",
    "however , we can get rid of @xmath111 by keeping it as a `` free '' variable , yielding minimal and maximal values for @xmath107 : @xmath113 keeping in addition @xmath110 as a free variable , we obtain another  less restrictive  minimal value for @xmath107 : @xmath114 since values of @xmath58 corresponding to @xmath115 or @xmath116 , where @xmath117 denotes the measured value of @xmath107 , are excluded , ( [ const1 ] ) and ( [ const2 ] ) imply an allowed range for @xmath58 .",
    "although it is too early to draw definite conclusions , it is interesting to note that the most recent cleo results on @xmath107 are in favour of strong constraints on @xmath58 , where the second quadrant , i.e.  @xmath118 , is preferred .",
    "such a situation would be in conflict with the standard analysis of the unitarity triangle , yielding @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "the observables @xmath107 imply also constraints on @xmath111 , where the present cleo data are in favour of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which would be in conflict with the theoretical expectation of equal signs for @xmath122 and @xmath123  @xcite .",
    "if future data should confirm this `` puzzle '' , it may be an indication for new - physics contributions to the ew penguin sector , or a manifestation of large non - factorizable @xmath103-breaking effects . in order to distinguish between these possibilties , detailed studies of the various patterns of new - physics effects in all @xmath2 decays are essential , as well as critical analyses of possible sources for @xmath103 breaking .",
    "as soon as cp asymmetries @xmath124 in @xmath99 or @xmath101 are observed , we may go beyond the bounds and may determine @xmath58 and @xmath111 .",
    "the physics potential of @xmath2 decays is very interesting and plays a central role for the @xmath0-factories .",
    "there are interesting strategies to extract ckm phases with the help of @xmath93-spin - related @xmath0 decays , where all down and strange quarks are interchanged with each other @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting one is provided by the decays @xmath3 and @xmath4 , allowing a simultaneous determination of @xmath51 and @xmath58 @xcite . this new strategy",
    "is not affected by any penguin topologies  it rather makes use of them  and does not rely on certain `` plausible '' dynamical or model - dependent assumptions .",
    "moreover , fsi effects , which led to considerable attention in the context of the determination of @xmath58 from @xmath2 decays , as we have noted in subsection  [ sec : bpik ] , do not lead to any problems .",
    "the theoretical accuracy is only limited by @xmath93-spin - breaking effects , which vanish in the factorization approximation in the present case .",
    "this strategy is ideally suited for lhcb ( @xmath125 ) @xcite , and is also very promising for cdf - ii @xcite .",
    "conceptually similar approaches are provided by @xmath126 or @xmath127 decays @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of non - leptonic @xmath0 decays is very rich and provides a fertile testing ground for the sm description of cp violation . as a by - product",
    ", interesting insights into hadronic physics can be obtained .",
    "there is no doubt that an exciting future  the @xmath0-physics era of particle physics  is ahead of us .",
