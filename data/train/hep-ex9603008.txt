    "the measurement of the inclusive deep inelastic lepton - proton scattering cross section has been of great importance for the understanding of the substructure of the proton  @xcite .",
    "experiments at hera extend the previously accessible kinematic range up to very large squared momentum transfers , @xmath7  gev@xmath2 , and to very small values of bjorken @xmath8 .",
    "the first observations showed a rise of the proton structure function @xmath0 at low @xmath9 with decreasing @xmath3  @xcite , based on data collected in 1992 .",
    "this rise was confirmed with the more precise data of 1993 @xcite .",
    "such a behaviour is qualitatively expected in the double leading log limit of quantum chromodynamics  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , not clarified whether the linear qcd evolution equations , as the conventional dglap evolution  @xcite in @xmath10 and/or the bfkl evolution  @xcite in @xmath11 , describe the rise of @xmath6 or whether there is a significant effect due to nonlinear parton recombination @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear whether this rise will persist at low @xmath1 , say of the order of a few gev@xmath2 .",
    "for example regge inspired models expect @xmath6 to be    flatter for small @xmath1 .",
    "the quantitative investigation of the quark - gluon interaction dynamics at low @xmath3 is one of the major goals of hera .",
    "it requires high precision for the @xmath6 measurement and a detailed study of the hadronic final state behaviour  @xcite .    the structure functions @xmath12",
    ", @xmath0 and @xmath13 are related to the inclusive lepton - photon cross - section @xmath14\\ ] ] and depend on the squared four momentum transfer @xmath1 and the scaling variable @xmath3 .",
    "these variables are related to the inelasticity parameter @xmath15 and to the total squared centre of mass energy of the collision @xmath16 as @xmath17 with @xmath18 . however , at low @xmath1 @xmath19 can be neglected and the previous expression can be rewritten as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 could not be measured yet at hera , but can be computed , supposing that perturbative qcd hold , for a given set of parton densities . thus @xmath0 can be derived from the double differential cross - section @xmath23 after experimental and qed radiative corrections . the structure function @xmath24 has not been measured yet , due to lack of statistics at high @xmath1 . however , simple differential cross - section @xmath25 both on neutral currents ( exchange of a @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) or in charged current ( exchange of @xmath28 ) have already been published @xcite . in the rest of this paper",
    "we will consider only the case of the @xmath26 exchange .    in 1994",
    "the incident electron energy was @xmath29  gev and the proton energy was @xmath30  gev .",
    "the data were recorded with the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite detectors .",
    "a salient feature of the hera collider experiments is the possibility of measuring not only the scattered electron but also the complete hadronic final state , apart from losses near the beam pipe .",
    "this means that the kinematic variables @xmath31 and @xmath1 can be determined with complementary methods which experimentally are sensitive to different systematic effects .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained with different methods improves the accuracy of the @xmath6 measurement .",
    "a convenient combination of the results ensures maximum coverage of the available kinematic range .    in this paper",
    "after a description of the data samples ( section 2 ) and of the kinematic reconstruction / event selection used ( section 3 ) we provide the @xmath6 measurement in section 4 . and its interpretation at low @xmath1 and in terms of perturbative qcd in section 5 , before giving some prospects in conclusion .",
    "in 1994 both experiments have reduced the minimum @xmath1 at which they could measure @xmath6 using several techniques . for dis events at low @xmath1",
    "the electron is scattered under a large angle @xmath32 ( the polar angles @xmath33 are defined w.r.t the proton beam direction , termed `` forward '' region ) .",
    "therefore the acceptance of electrons in the backward region has to be increased or the incident electron energy to be reduced to go down in @xmath1 .",
    "this was realized as follows .",
    "\\i ) both experiments were able to diminish the region around the backward beam pipe in which the electron could not be measured reliably in 93 , thus increasing the maximum polar angle of the scattered electron ( cf @xcite for details ) .",
    "this large statistic sample , taken with the nominal hera conditions is called the `` nominal vertex '' sample .",
    "its integrated luminosity is between 2 and 3  pb@xmath34 , depending on the analysis / experiment .",
    "\\ii ) following a pilot exercise performed last year , 58  nb@xmath34 of data was collected for which the interaction point was shifted by + 62  cm , in the forward direction , resulting in an increase of the electron acceptance .",
    "this sample is refered to as the `` shifted vertex '' data sample . in h1 the low @xmath1 region",
    "was also covered by analyzing events which originated from the `` early '' proton satellite bunch , present during all periods of the hera operation , which collided with an electron bunch at a position shifted by @xmath3563  cm .",
    "these data , refered to as the `` satellite '' data sample amount to @xmath36 of the total data and correspond to a total `` luminosity '' of 68  nb@xmath34 .",
    "\\iii ) both experiments used dis events which underwent initial state photon radiation detected in an appropriate photon tagger to measure @xmath6 at lower @xmath1 ( so called `` radiative '' sample @xcite ) . the incident electron energy which participate in the hard scattering",
    "is thus reduced , and so is the @xmath1 .",
    "the luminosity was determined from the measured cross section of the bethe heitler reaction @xmath37 , measuring the hard photon bremsstrahlung data only .",
    "the precision of the luminosity for the nominal vertex position data amounts to 1.5% , i.e. an improvement of a factor 3 w.r.t the analysis of the 1993 data . for the shifted vertex data the luminosity uncertainty is higher ( 4.5% for h1 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the satellite data sample was obtained from the measured luminosity for the shifted vertex data multiplied by the efficiency corrected event ratio in a kinematic region common to both data sets .",
    "the uncertainty of that luminosity determination was estimated to be 5% .",
    "the kinematic variables of the inclusive scattering process @xmath38 can be reconstructed in different ways using measured quantities from the hadronic final state and from the scattered electron .",
    "the choice of the reconstruction method for @xmath1 and @xmath15 determines the size of systematic errors , acceptance and radiative corrections .",
    "the basic formulae for @xmath1 and @xmath15 used in the different methods are summarized below , @xmath3 being obtained from @xmath39 . for the electron method @xmath40 the resolution in @xmath41 is @xmath42 while the @xmath43 measurement degrades as @xmath44 and can not be used for @xmath45 . in the low @xmath15 region",
    "it is , however , possible to use the hadronic methods for which it is convenient to define the following variables @xmath46 here @xmath47 are the four - momentum vector components of each particle and the summation is over all hadronic final state particles .",
    "the standard definitions for @xmath48 and @xmath49 are @xmath50 the combination of @xmath48 and @xmath41 defines the mixed method which is well suited for medium and low @xmath15 measurements .",
    "the same is true for the double - angle method which makes use only of @xmath32 and @xmath49 and is thus insensitive to the absolute energy calibration : @xmath51    the formulae for the @xmath52 method are constructed requiring @xmath1 and @xmath15 to be independent of the incident electron energy . using the conservation of the total @xmath53 , the sum extending over all particles of the event ,",
    "@xmath54 is replaced by @xmath55 which gives @xmath56 by construction @xmath57 and @xmath58 are independent of initial state photon radiation . with respect to @xmath48",
    "the modified quantity @xmath59 is less sensitive to the hadronic measurement at high @xmath15 , since the @xmath52 term dominates the total @xmath60 of the event . at low @xmath15 , @xmath48 and @xmath57",
    "are equivalent .",
    "h1 measures @xmath6 with the electron and the @xmath52 method and after a complete consistency check uses the electron method for @xmath61 and the @xmath52 method for @xmath62 .",
    "zeus measures @xmath6 with the electron and the double angle method and for the final results uses the electron method at low @xmath1 and the double angle method for high @xmath1 ( @xmath63 15  gev@xmath2 ) .",
    "the binning in @xmath3 and @xmath1 was chosen to match the resolution in these variables .",
    "it was set at 5(8 ) bins per order in magnitude in x(@xmath1 ) for the h1 experiment and about twice as coarse for the zeus experiment in @xmath3 ( similar to h1 in @xmath1 ) .",
    "the event selection is similar in the two experiments .",
    "events are filtered on - line using calorimetric triggers which requests an electromagnetic cluster of at least 5  gev not vetoed by a trigger element signing a beam background event .",
    "offline , further electron identification criteria are applied ( track - cluster link , shower shape and radius ) and a minimum energy of 8(11 )  gev is requested in zeus(h1 ) .",
    "h1 requests a reconstructed vertex within 3@xmath64 of the expected interaction position , while zeus requires that the quantity @xmath65 satisfies 35  gev @xmath66 65  gev .",
    "if no particle escapes detection , @xmath67 55  gev , so the @xmath68 cut reduces the photoproduction background and the size of the radiative corrections . the only significant background left after the selection comes from photoproduction in which a hadronic shower fakes an electron . in h1 for instance , it has been estimated consistently both from the data and from monte carlo simulation and amounts to less than 3% except in a few bins where it can reach values up to 15% .",
    "it is subtracted statistically bin by bin and an error of 30% is assigned to it .",
    "the acceptance and the response of the detector has been studied and understood in great detail by the two experiments : more than two millions monte carlo dis events were generated using django  @xcite and different quark distribution parametrizations , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately @xmath69  pb@xmath34 .",
    "the program is based on heracles  @xcite for the electroweak interaction and on lepto  @xcite to simulate the hadronic final state .",
    "heracles includes first order radiative corrections , the simulation of real bremsstrahlung photons and the longitudinal structure function .",
    "the acceptance corrections were performed using the grv  @xcite or the mrs parametrization  @xcite , which both describe rather well the hera @xmath6 results of 1993 for @xmath70  gev@xmath2 .",
    "lepto uses the colour dipole model ( cdm ) as implemented in ariadne  @xcite which is in good agreement with data on the energy flow and other characteristics of the final state as measured by h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite . for the estimation of systematic errors connected with the topology of the hadronic final state , the herwig model  @xcite",
    "was used in a dedicated analysis .",
    "based on the geant program  @xcite the detector response was simulated in detail .",
    "after this step the monte carlo events were subject to the same reconstruction and analysis chain as the real data .",
    "the structure function @xmath0 was derived after radiative corrections from the one - photon exchange cross section @xmath71 effects due to @xmath72 boson exchange are smaller than 2% .",
    "the structure function ratio @xmath73 has not been measured yet at hera and was calculated using the qcd relation  @xcite and the grv structure function parametrization .",
    "compared to the 1993 data analyses  @xcite the @xmath6 measurement has been extended to lower @xmath1 ( from @xmath74  gev@xmath2 to @xmath75  gev@xmath2 ) , and to lower and higher @xmath3 ( from @xmath76 to @xmath77 ) . the determination of the structure function requires the measured event numbers to be converted to the bin averaged cross section based on the monte carlo acceptance calculation .",
    "all detector efficiencies were determined from the data using the redundancy of the apparatus .",
    "apart from very small extra corrections all efficiencies are correctly reproduced by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the bin averaged cross section was corrected for higher order qed radiative contributions and a bin size correction was performed .",
    "this determined the one - photon exchange cross section which according to eq.[dsigma ] led to the values for @xmath0 .    due to the different data sets available : `` nominal vertex '' data , `` radiative events '' , `` shifted vertex '' data and `` satellite '' data , which have different acceptances and use for a given @xmath78 point different parts of the detectors , cross checks could be made in kinematic regions of overlap .",
    "the results were found to be in very good agreement with each other for all kinematic reconstruction methods used .",
    "the large available statistics allows to make very detailed studies on the detector response : efficiencies and calibration . as a result",
    "the systematic errors on many effects are reduced , compared to the 1993 data analysis . here",
    "only a brief summary of these preliminary errors is given , refering the reader to the original and forthcoming @xmath6 publications : for the electron method the main source of error are the energy calibration ( known at 1.5% level in 1994 ) , the knowledge of the electron identification efficiency and to a lesser extent the error on the polar angle of the scattered electron , ( @xmath791mrad ) in particular at the lowest @xmath1 and the radiative corrections at low @xmath3 . for the @xmath52 method ,",
    "the knowledge of the absolute energy scale for the hadrons , the fraction of hadrons which stay undetected in particular at low @xmath3 , due to calorimetric thresholds and to a lesser extent the electron energy calibration are the dominating factors . for the double angle method ,",
    "the major problem comes from the precision in the resolution of the hadronic angle at low @xmath3 and low @xmath1 .",
    "further uncertainties common to all methods ( selection , structure function dependance etc . ) were also studied .",
    "the preliminary error on the 1994 data ranges between 10 and 20% with expected final values for publication below 10% .",
    "the preliminary results of h1 and zeus are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2x ] , in bins of fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the rise of @xmath6 at low @xmath3 is confirmed with the higher precision , and is now observed down to the lowest @xmath1 measured ( 1.5  gev@xmath2 ) . the observed good agreement between h1 and zeus and the smooth transition between the hera and the fixed target ( e665 , nmc ) data consolidates this result which can thus be confronted to theoretical expectations . the steepness of the low @xmath3 rise increases visibly with the @xmath1 , a characteristic expected from perturbative qcd .",
    "this rise can not be attributed to the presence of `` diffractive '' events in the dis sample since their proportion has been shown to stay essentially constant (  10% ) independently of @xmath3 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a test of perturbative qcd is displayed in fig .",
    "[ f2q ] which represents the results of next to leading order ( nlo ) qcd fit performed by h1 as explained in @xcite on the data with @xmath80 5  gev@xmath2 .",
    "in order to constrain the structure function @xmath6 at high @xmath3 , data from the fixed target scattering experiment nmc @xcite and bcdms @xcite are used , avoiding regions where higher twist and target mass effects could become important .",
    "the @xmath6 behaviour can be well described by the dglap evolution equations within the present preliminary errors .",
    "the data for @xmath1 values below 5  gev@xmath2 are also compatible with the extrapolation of the fit in this region , as can be seen in the figure .",
    "this preliminary result is consistent with the published qcd analysis of h1 and zeus 1993 data , which allowed to determine the gluon density in the proton , and observe its steep rise at low @xmath3 as displayed in fig .",
    "[ glu ] for @xmath81 20  gev@xmath2 .",
    "another test of perturbative qcd lies in observing the asymptotic behaviour as suggested by early studies @xcite .",
    "ball and forte  @xcite have recently shown that evolving a flat input distribution at some @xmath82 , of the order of 1  gev@xmath2 , with the dglap equations leads to a strong rise of @xmath6 at low @xmath3 in the region measured by hera .",
    "an interesting feature is that if qcd evolution is the underlying dynamics of the rise , perturbative qcd predicts that at large @xmath1 and small @xmath3 the structure function exhibits double scaling in the two variables @xmath64 and @xmath83 defined as : @xmath84    in figure  [ ball05 ] the h1 data are presented in the variables @xmath64 and @xmath83 , taking the boundary conditions to be @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . in a previous analysis @xcite",
    "the value @xmath88 was chosen , but the new low @xmath1 data seems to indicate that @xmath6 is not yet flat for this @xmath1 value .",
    "the measured values of @xmath6 are rescaled by @xmath89 to remove the part of the leading subasymptotic behaviour which can be calculated in a model independent way ; @xmath90 is then predicted to rise linearly with @xmath64 .",
    "scaling in @xmath83 can be shown by multiplying @xmath6 by the factor @xmath91 . here",
    "@xmath92 with @xmath93 being the leading order coefficient of the @xmath94 function of the qcd renormalization group equation for four flavours , @xmath95 for four flavours and three colours .",
    "[ ball05]a shows @xmath96 versus @xmath83 . scaling roughly sets in for @xmath97 .",
    "[ ball05]b , for @xmath97 , shows scaling behaviour , namely a linear of @xmath90 with @xmath64 .",
    "these observations suggest that perturbative qcd could be already valid at @xmath81 1 or 2  gev@xmath2 . indeed within the present precision we can observe in fig .",
    "[ f2grv ] the validity of the glck , reya , vogt ( grv ) model @xcite which assumes that all low @xmath3 partons are generated `` radiatively '' starting from a very low initial @xmath98 0.34  gev@xmath2 scale , in which both gluon and quark densities are `` valence '' like .",
    "this result appears surprising since perturbative qcd does not apply at such a low scale , but the hera results and the e665 @xcite preliminary results follow the grv expectations as early as 0.8  gev@xmath2 .",
    "more precise data are needed to further constrain the model and draw definite conclusions on the dynamics underlying the low @xmath3 rise .",
    "nevertheless these results appear already very promising for the dglap evolution equations which might not need to be supplemented by the bfkl evolution at low @xmath3 , in the hera kinematic domain .",
    "focusing now on low @xmath1 , the persistent rise of @xmath6 at low @xmath3 , when going down in @xmath1 indicates that the photoproduction regime has not been reached yet .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ gp ] which display the behaviour of the total cross - section of the proton - virtual photon system as a function of @xmath99 , the invariant mass of the @xmath100 system ( at low @xmath3 , @xmath101 ) .",
    "@xmath6 is related to the total cross - section of the proton - virtual photon interaction ( @xmath102 via @xmath103 the @xmath104 growth can be contrasted with the weak rise with @xmath99 of the total real photoproduction cross - section in the same range of @xmath99 : 20 - 250  gev @xcite    the regge inspired models dola  @xcite and ckmt@xcite which can describe the behaviour of @xmath105 predicts a rather flat behaviour of @xmath6 at a few gev@xmath2 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ lowq2 ] , the dola model clearly fails before 1.5  gev@xmath2 , while the ckmt model which assumes that the `` bare '' pomeron visible at high @xmath1 has a higher trajectory intercept ( @xmath106 ) than the `` effective '' pomeron involved in `` soft '' interactions ( @xmath107 ) undershoot the data in a less critical manner .",
    "in this same plot we can also notice the similarity above 5  gev@xmath2 between the different parametrizations ( grv , mrs , cteq @xcite ) which use essentially the same data to determine their parton distributions at the reference scale .",
    "the hera structure function program is still in its infancy , but has already provided exciting results at low @xmath3 .",
    "the dynamics underlying the behaviour of the structure function can be studied in an exclusive way using jets or particle spectra , since hera is a collider equipped with ( two ) 4@xmath108 detectors . in the next 2 or 3 years",
    "@xmath109 will be measured , by taking data at different beam energies in order to keep @xmath3 and @xmath1 constant while varying @xmath15 , thus improving the knowledge on @xmath6 and on qcd .",
    "the statistics will increase in such a way that a first measurement of @xmath19 will be made , and a precise determination of @xmath110 should be possible . in 95 ,",
    "both experiments have upgraded their detector in the backward area in order to reach lower @xmath1 ( @xmath111 0.1  gev@xmath2 ) with good precision .",
    "this year will thus be devoted to understand the questions raised in this paper concerning the low @xmath3 and low @xmath1 dynamics and to open up further stringent test of qcd , in particular about the behaviour of the high parton density .",

    "<S> @xmath6 increases significantly with decreasing @xmath3 , even in the lowest reachable @xmath1 region . </S>",
    "<S> the data are well described by a next to leading order ( nlo ) qcd fit , and support within the present precision that the rise at low @xmath3 within this @xmath1 range is generated `` radiatively '' via the dglap evolution equations . </S>",
