    "efficiency of electron heating in high mach number collisionless shocks is one of the outstanding issues of space plasma physics as well as astrophysics .",
    "it is known from observations that quite efficient heating occurs in extremely high mach number shocks like snr ( super nova remnant ) shocks @xcite , while in - situ observations of earth s bow shock mostly show inefficient heating of electrons @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that a dominant electron heating process and its efficiency through a variety of microinstabilities in shock transition regions strongly depend on mach numbers .",
    "typical mach number of the earth s bow shock is @xmath0 , while that of the snr shocks is of the order of @xmath1 . in the late 1980s a new process of strong and rapid electron heating in extremely high mach number shocks",
    "was proposed @xcite .",
    "6 and 7 discussed the so - called two step instabilities generated by a high velocity reflected ion beam which destabilizes bi ( buneman instability ) followed by ion acoustic instability .",
    "a necessary condition for the bi to be destabilized in the foot of quasi - perpendicular shocks is @xmath2 @xcite , where @xmath3 is the alfvn mach number and @xmath4 the electron plasma beta .",
    "if the above condition is satisfied , rapid electron heating with saturation temperature @xmath5 occurs and the ion acoustic instability sets in leading to further electron heating @xcite .",
    "this condition is easily satisfied in snr shocks , although it is usually not in the earth s bow shock .",
    "the two step instabilities were again shed light on after ref . 9 by utilizing electromagnetic full pic ( particle - in - cell ) simulations .",
    "they improved understandings of the process not only in terms of electron heating but also in terms of a production process of non - thermal electrons , and promoted a number of subsequent simulation studies @xcite .",
    "as a result , understandings of electron heating or acceleration processes initiated by the bi in the context of the shock physics have been extensively developed .",
    "on the other hand , it has been well - known that various microinstabilities are possible to get excited also in relatively low mach number supercritical shocks @xcite . since",
    "most of the microinstabilities are inseparable with electron dynamics , their nonlinear evolutions in self - consistently reproduced shock structures in pic simulations are studied only recently @xcite except for refs .",
    "it is revealed that mtsi ( modified two - stream instability ) becomes dominant in the foot of the earth s bow shock or interplanetary shocks at @xmath6 au @xcite .",
    "simulation studies on nonlinear evolutions of the mtsi in periodic systems were extensively studied in the 1970s and 1980s @xcite , although these simulations imposed some strong assumptions that the code was electrostatic @xcite and unmagnetized ions with small ion - to - electron mass ratio were used @xcite . recently",
    ", some developement without these assumptions are made @xcite .",
    "8 showed in a one - dimensional simulation with realistic mass ratio that long time evolution of the mtsi results in lower cascade of wave spectrum and associated electron heating .",
    "furthermore , it is indicated in two - dimensional simulation that the mtsi can finally survive even if other possible instability like electron cyclotron drift instability is present @xcite .",
    "all these simulation studies show electron heating or acceleration in the long time evolution of the system .",
    "however , as mentioned already , electron heating in the earth s bow shock is seldom observed in - situ .",
    "such a discripancy may arise because of lack of systematic estimate of electron heating rate in simulation studies with more realistic parameters .",
    "for example , all of the above simulation studies on the mtsi assume very low values of squared ratio of electron plasma to cyclotron frequencies , @xmath7 .",
    "importance of @xmath8 in association with electron heating in the long time evolution of the mtsi is unresolved , while @xmath8 is known to be a crucial parameter controlling nonlinear electron heating and acceleration processes in the bi dominant system @xcite .",
    "electron plasma beta is also rather small in most of the previous studies ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this may exaggerate effects of electron trapping in the nonlinear stage of the mtsi @xcite .",
    "the electron plasma beta in the solar wind is usually several times higher so that importance of the trapping process may be blurred .",
    "hence , in realistic situations expected to be achieved in the typical solar wind conditions an alternative electron heating mechanism and its efficiency are ought to be considered .    in this paper , first , electron heating through the mtsi in transition regions of high mach number quasi - perpendicular shocks is reconsidered in section ii . here , quasilinear diffusion is assumed as an alternative electron heating process .",
    "the analysis assumes a broad wave spectrum and small wave amplitudes which are likely to be satisfied in the past simulation studies mentioned above @xcite .",
    "an additional assumption that relative phases among different wave modes are random is also imposed , while this point is currently not evident . under these assumptions , taking second order velocity moments of the so - called quasilinear equations provides evolution equations of electron kinetic energies .",
    "these equations are numerically integrated by imposing the quasilinear assumptions in every instantaneous time steps to obtain saturation kinetic energies as a fuction of the mach number of shocks .",
    "this approach allows to discuss long time evolution of macroscopic quantities including the electron temperature without any restrictions for parameters .",
    "it is intriguing whether the mach number dependence of electron heating throug the mtsi in relatively low mach number regime is different from that through the bi in extremely high mach number regime .",
    "if that is the case , one may expect presence of a critical mach number above which electron heating rate runs up due to the switching of the dominant microinstability @xcite . in section iii ,",
    "the results are compared with 1d pic simulations in which the mtsi is dominantly generated in the foot and effective electron temperature just behind of the shock is measured .",
    "furthermore , post - shock effective electron temperature is measured also in cases that the bi gets excited in the foot . in those cases a rough estimate of the electron temperature is given by using the well - known trapping theory .",
    "finally , a summary and discussions including estimate of the critical mach number are given in section iv .",
    "a foot region of a quasiperpendicular shock is modeled by a plasma composed of incoming electrons at rest , incoming ions , and specularly reflected ions with local approximation .",
    "the ambient magnetic field is along the @xmath10-axis , while the incoming and the reflected ion beams are streaming parallel and antiparallel to a wavevector which is defined in the @xmath11 plane and parallel to the shock normal .",
    "this is essentially the same system discussed in the linear analysis of ref .",
    "since the mtsi grows much faster than ion cyclotron period , ions are assumed to be unmagnetized .",
    "saturation levels of electron kinetic energy through the mtsi are examined as follows . in a vlasov equation ,",
    "@xmath12 variables are expanded around zero - th order slowly varying quantities ( with subscript 0 ) as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are a distribution function , electric charge , and mass of species @xmath17 , @xmath18 is speed of light , @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent magnetic and electric fields , respectively .",
    "the variables with subscript 1 denote fluctuations corresponding to linear oscillations . with a standard approach of quasilinear analysis , an evolution equation of @xmath21",

    "note that in eqs.([qleq])-([psi2 ] ) parallel and perpendicular directions are defined in terms of @xmath27 .",
    "although this is true for electrons , further note is needed for ions . because ions are assumed to be unmagnetized , distinction of parallel and perpendicular directions in this sense is meaningless .",
    "however , their evolution equations can be formally written in a similar form by defining parallel and perpendicular directions in terms of the ion beam velocity .",
    "this corresponds to a transformation for the rotation of the susceptibility tensor @xcite .    to discuss the extended quasilinear evolution of kinetic energies through the mtsi",

    "eqs.([paraene])-([enecon ] ) form a closed set of extended quasilinear evolution equations of the system .",
    "we solve the above set of equations numerically in the following subsection .",
    "similar analyses were performed by many authors @xcite . ref .",
    "38 introduced detailed procedure of the method and applied it to estimate of saturation of electromagnetic ion cyclotron instability driven by ion temperature anisotropy .",
    "39 and 40 directly solved the quasilinear equation to discuss electron heating and formation of a high energy ion tail through the ion acoustic instability .",
    "33 , on the other hand , discussed a problem similar to here on the mtsi and gave detailed comparisons of their results with 1d and 2d pic simulations .",
    "however , their analysis includes only nonresonant wave - particle interactions which in turn only slight electron heating which is much less effective compared with a subsequent heating process through nonlinear trapping observed in their pic simulation .",
    "furthermore , they imposed an electrostatic assumption on whole their analyses as well as on their pic simulations . as they pointed out , the electrostatic approximation is valid only when @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes the alfvn velocity , and @xmath56 is the electron plasma beta ( ratio of electron thermal to magnetic pressures ) .",
    "usually in solar wind @xmath56 is of the order of @xmath57 so that the above condition reads @xmath58 which is probably satisfied only in transition regions of rather low mach number shocks . since our attention is paid for wide range of mach numbers , we exclude such an assumption .    before solving eqs.([paraene])-([enecon ] )",
    "numerically , a few assumptions are imposed .",
    "the distribution functions of each species remain in ( shifted ) maxwellian all the time after ref .",
    "38 . by this assumption , it is easy to obtain @xmath59 and @xmath47 at each time step as instantaneous solutions of the linear dispersion relation .",
    "the actual distribution functions are given by @xmath60 for species @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 denote parallel and perpendicular thermal velocities . as mentioned before , note that the parallel and perpendicular directions are difined in association with @xmath27 for electrons , while with @xmath63 for incoming and reflected ions .",
    "the bulk velocities of the incoming and reflected ions ( subscripts @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively ) satisfy zero current condition so that @xmath66 .",
    "it is also assumed that the response of the ions to the wave fields is electrostatic , while the wave - electron interactions are treated as fully electromagnetic .",
    "therefore , the ion heating is thought to be parallel to @xmath67 or @xmath68 .    under these assumptions ,",

    "only the linear resonant wave - praticle interactions are taken into account",
    ". therefore , change of kinetic energy of the reflected ions ( @xmath74 ) can be neglected when we consider the mtsi based on electron - incoming ion interactions .",
    "that is , here , the reflected ions are assumed to be a background component satisfying current and charge neutralities .",
    "reactions of the reflected ions may be essential when influences of the mtsi on the reformation process are considered @xcite .",
    "however , it is out of scope in this paper . in the following",

    "for the moment , @xmath87 is fixed to unity just for simplicity .",
    "the field energy exponentially grows in the beginning of the run , although other variables have not been much changed in a visible manner until the field energy reaches at a certain level .",

    "correspondingly , changing rates of other variables decrease and those variables approach some constant values when the field energy becomes sufficiently small .",
    "such a state is regarded as a saturation state and those constant values are defined as saturation levels .",
    "the saturation state in this system is achieved when the field energy is damped out . in the analysis we check whether the system saturates basically by eye . however , in some special cases where the kinetic energies have not reached at constant values for long time the saturation levels are defined as the values at @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the time at which @xmath83 decreases by @xmath94 from its initial value . since @xmath95 is thought to be a typical time scale of shock reformation , considering the system evolution longer than this time scale may not make sense .    in fig.[fig01 ]",
    "@xmath96 keeps almost constant incontrast to @xmath88 or @xmath89 .",
    "this reflects which kinetic effects dominantly work .",
    "the linear growth rate , @xmath97 , can be written by linear superposition of the terms such as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively . when @xmath101 , contribution from the corresponding term to the growth rate becomes non - negligible . in this sense @xmath102 , and @xmath103",
    "can be indicators how strong the effects of landau and cyclotron dampings of electrons , and inverse ion landau damping are , respectively .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.[fig01 ] represents values of these indicators .",
    "it is now clear that the electron landau damping is the strongest kinetic effect and the electron cyclotron damping hardly works .",
    "the inverse ion landau damping can also work , but may not be so strong as the electron landau damping for this particular case .",

    "@xmath120 is essentially independent from @xmath107 for @xmath121 indicating that heating process is similar for relatively high @xmath107 . in the low @xmath107 ,",
    "on the other hand , there is a trend that electron heating is suppressed for @xmath110 .",
    "for sufficiently low @xmath122 , number of resonant particles is very little so that it takes extremely long time to heat electrons .",
    "then after the very long time , heating is suddenly triggered when field energy becomes large enough .",
    "such an unnatural time evolution occurs because of the assumptions that only the resonant wave - particle interactions are taken into account and that the distribution functions are always maxellian .",
    "indeed , it is known from pic simulations that effects of particle trapping , which have not been included in this analysis , become important for low @xmath107 cases @xcite .",

    "the whistler waves which can interact with the high speed ion beam should have appropriately high phase velocities .",
    "the phase velocity of an oblique whistler wave is proportional to @xmath137 @xcite so that a high mach number shock generates high phase velocity , i.e. , less oblique , whistler waves .",
    "this effect appears in the bottom panel . as a result",
    ", @xmath138 does not change so much even the mach number varies , so that @xmath120 remains in the same order for wide mach number regime examined here .",

    "as mentioned earlier , ion kinetic effect seems to be non - negligible . as a result ,",
    "ion heating is more remarkable than in the cases with @xmath118 .",

    "if @xmath185 and @xmath186 are assumed , corresponding electron temperature is @xmath187ev which is consistent with a typical temperature observed downstream of the earth s bow shock .",
    "however , addiabatic heating due to increases of magnetic field and cross shock potential also results in the downstream electron temperature similar to this value .",
    "this may be the reason why remarkable electron heating was seldom observed in near earth shocks in the past .",
    "but one may capture the nonadiabatic parallel electron heating if upstream electron beta is low enough ( @xmath188 ) , since eq.([sat_ql ] ) is still valid for rather low beta cases where the trapping effects become essential as mentioned in section ii .",
    "furthermore , as shown in the upper right panel of fig.[fig04 ] , local temperature anisotropy , @xmath189 , in a transition region may be observed as a result of strong mtsi in some parameter regimes . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective electron temperature significantly increases with being proportinal to @xmath142 in @xmath183 .",
    "although this is consistent with the past studies @xcite , the saturation electron temperature estimated in this study seems to be rather smaller .",
    "this should be because of that the heating process in highly nonlinear stage including the second step ion acoustic instability is neglected .",
    "electron temperature seen in ref .",
    "10 seems to be about one order higher than the estimate given by eq.([sat - ehole ] ) .",
    "this implies that an actual @xmath181 may appear at a little smaller value .",
    "consistency of the results of the extended quasilinear analysis and the pic simulations for the mtsi dominant cases indicates that the resonant wave - particle interactions are essential in electron heating through the mtsi .",
    "in other wards , nonresonant wave - particle interactions which have been neglected in the analysis may not be effective .",
    "it should also be noted that using unrealistically small @xmath8 in pic simulations is justified as far as the mtsi is concerned because of the weak dependence on @xmath8 ( bottom panel of fig.2 ) in contrast to the bi dominant systems .",
    "the transition at @xmath190 might not be so drastic in a realistic case . in the analyses presented here ,",
    "all other possible candidates of microinstabilities have been neglected .",
    "for example , ecdi ( electron cyclotron drift instability ) is one candidate @xcite and it might become important around this critical mach number , although there are some negative indications for the ecdi to become dominant . for instance , it is known that the saturation level of the ecdi is usually not so high @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the ecdi gets excited simultaneously with the mtsi , the mtsi becomes dominant for wide parameter range @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the ecdi can be important only when @xmath8 is of the order of unity @xcite .",
    "hence , the mach number regime where the ecdi is dominant seems not to be so wide , but we do not remove the possibility that the ecdi gives some contributions to electron heating around @xmath181 . because the ecdi is insensitive to the electron landau damping which may strongly affect to the bi in this mach number regime .",
    "further , it is known that the mtsi can not get excited in extremely high mach number shocks like @xmath191 @xcite .",
    "there are also other possible microinstabilities in higher dimensional cases @xcite .",
    "contributions from them should be carefully estimated .",
    "some of them have been discussed recently by performing two dimensional pic simulations @xcite .",
    "the multi - dimansionality may give another important contributions to electron heating .",
    "42 pointed out that electrons are accelerated in the so - called rippled structure which is the ion scale structure along the shock surface .",
    "nevertheless , what should be emphasized here is that the mach number dependence of the effective electron temperature is systematically different between high and low mach number regimes .    in the present extended quasilinear analysis",
    "the damping of the wave energy in the late stage ( e.g. , @xmath192 in fig.[fig01 ] ) may be an artifact . because of the assumption that the distribution function is always maxwellian , the so - called plateau of the distribution function is never produced in this system .",
    "the field energy might saturate earlier at a certain level if the plateau is produced . in this regard , it might be better that the saturation levels are defined as the values at the time when the field energy becomes the maximum . however , the resultant saturation levels based on the two definitions , i.e. , the saturation temperatures estimated at times corresponding to the maximum and the later sufficiently small field energies , are not so much different from each other . although it is possible to solve the quasilinear equation , eq.([qleq ] ) , directly as done in refs .",
    "39 and 40 , that is the future work .",
    "the explorations of the inner heliosphere will be underway through the bepicolombo mission .",
    "the perihelion point of the mercury is about 0.3au where quite high velocity ipss which have not been decerelated are expected to be observed .",
    "43 estimated the propagation speed of one of the ipss observed in august 1972 and concluded that it approached to @xmath193 km / s at 0.3au from the sun .",
    "more optimistic estimate for the same ips is given in ref .",
    "44 as @xmath194 km / s at 0.3au .",
    "these results imply that the mach number of this ips approached to several tens .",
    "therefore , the transition of the electron heating efficiency at @xmath181 , if present , will be possibly observed in situ @xcite .",
