    "the term `` luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbgs ) '' describes small , luminous ( @xmath9 ) , high - surface brightness galaxies with blue optical colors and strong emission lines @xcite .",
    "such objects had previously been classified as e.g. faint blue galaxies , compact narrow emission line galaxies ( cnelgs ) @xcite , luminous compact galaxies @xcite , or blue compact galaxies @xcite , with varying selection criteria .",
    "prior work has indicated that lcbgs are progenitors of different intermediate - and low mass galaxies in the local universe that are brightened by intense star formation ( sf ) ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies undergoing an lcbg phase may contribute @xmath10 of the comoving uv - derived sf rate density of the universe and @xmath11 of the field galaxy number density at @xmath12 @xcite , and show the strongest known number density decline ( @xmath13 ) from intermediate @xmath8 @xmath14 to 0 ; they are almost absent in the local universe @xcite .",
    "lcbg phases do therefore contribute sizeably to the evolutionary phenomena observed in the whole galaxy population to @xmath15  the global increase of sf activity @xcite , and the luminosity and number density evolution of blue galaxies @xcite .",
    "this _ letter _ addresses the controversial question which types of local galaxies , or which of their subcomponents , experienced the lcbg phases of massive sf at redshifts @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite distinguished smaller lcbgs ( half - light radius @xmath18kpc ) with low velocity dispersion ( @xmath19kms@xmath20 ) and starburst dwarf  like morphologies , and larger , more massive lcbgs ( @xmath21kms@xmath20 ) , more similar to local irregular and starburst disk galaxies .",
    "they argued that the former may fade to ultimately become local low - mass spheroidals / dwarf ellipticals while the latter may evolve into local small disks and irregulars . on the other hand , @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggested that lcbgs probably represent interaction - induced formation of bulges in today s massive spiral galaxies , possibly accompanied by inside - out disk formation @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the apparently small linewidths and sizes of lcbgs do not represent intrinsic properties of these galaxies : as suggested by @xcite and shown by @xcite , a nuclear starburst in an ordinary extended disk can skew its effective radius , effective surface brightness and colors to mimic a blue , compact galaxy . the nuclear burst s nebular emission would sample only the inner part of the galaxy s velocity field , and thus lead to an underestimate of its dynamical mass .",
    "this scenario becomes particularly worrisome with increasing redshift , where cosmological surface brightness dimming hampers the detection of low surface brightness ( lsb ) components , and nebular emission lines are usually the only indicator of faint galaxies kinematics .    to constrain the above scenarios , we present the first structural study of the extended components in intermediate-@xmath8 lcbgs , using the uniquely deep images from the hst / acs ultra deep field(f435w ) , @xmath22(f606v ) , @xmath23(f775w ) and @xmath8(f850lp ) filters respectively ; pi : s. beckwith , stsci ] ( udf ) to search for extended disk components in 26 lcbgs .",
    "details of this study can be found in an accompanying paper ( noeske et al .",
    "2005c , in prep .",
    "; hereafter paper ii ) . throughout this _",
    ", we adopt a @xmath24cdm cosmology ( @xmath25kms@xmath20mpc@xmath20 , @xmath26 )",
    "we adopted similar rest - frame selection criteria to those by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for local lcbg samples : ( i ) blue rest - frame @xmath27 , ( ii ) average rest - frame surface brightness within the half - light radius @xmath28mag/@xmath29 ) , ( iii ) @xmath30 , and ( iv ) half - light radius @xmath31kpc .",
    "these somewhat arbitrary limits include both extremely compact cnelgs , and larger lcbgs , more comparable to those analyzed by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the galaxies were selected from the udf sextractor catalog ( beckwith et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , after computing linear extents and rest - frame photometry , using the deep2 @xmath32corrections @xcite and robust spectroscopic @xcite and photometric redshifts @xcite .",
    "after removing doubtful cases and 2 agn , this yielded 26 objects at @xmath33 , @xmath34 at @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig3 ] for examples .",
    "all lcbg images were analysed through two surface photometry methods : ( i ) 1-d surface brightness profiles ( sbps ) were derived using the morphology - adaptive mask algorithm `` lazy '' described in @xcite ( `` method iv '' ) and @xcite , with procedures detailed in these papers .",
    "lazy can treat the irregular morphologies of lcbgs and is robust at low intensity levels , allowing to detect and measure , or reject , large lsb structures .",
    "the resulting sbps typically showed approximately exponential , moderately extended components ( see section [ results ] ) which we fitted by exponential laws outside the brighter central excesses ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( ii ) psf effects on measured structural parameters of the extended components are non - negligible . for brighter components with roughly elliptical isophotes , psf treatment is provided by the galfit code @xcite .",
    "we decomposed the lcbgs into two exponential components .",
    "obviously unphysical fits due to very irregular morphologies were rejected , as well as fitted extended components fainter than an empirical reliability limit of 25 ab mag in @xmath23 and @xmath8 .",
    "comparisons between between lazy and galfit , and reliability assessments are detailed in paper ii .",
    "exponential scale lengths ( @xmath36 ) from lazy are typically overestimated for small objects ( @xmath37kpc ) by a factor of @xmath381.3 , few up to @xmath39 , while for larger scale lengths , galfit can underestimate @xmath36 by a factor @xmath38 1.3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "both methods hence bracket the true scale lengths .",
    "examples of sbps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in most cases ,",
    "the rest - frame @xmath40 band sbps reached beyond the rest - frame holmberg radius ( @xmath1 ) even for compact objects at @xmath2 ( see object udf0901 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the sbps of most lcbgs display a moderately extended , roughly exponential component , corresponding to a mostly fairly regular outer component in the images ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . at smaller radii ,",
    "the sbps show brighter , smaller components , in excess of the extended exponentials .",
    "these range from bright nuclei to extended emission over a large part of the galaxy , and reflect the irregular blue emission seen in the images , i.e. probably the ongoing sf . for larger lcbgs , this structure has previously been reported @xcite . for smaller",
    "lcbgs , our current udf dataset verifies what the data by @xcite suggested : also these objects , similar to local hii galaxies or distant cnelgs , have roughly exponential stellar components that pre - date the ongoing sf",
    ".    rest - frame colors of the extended components are @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 of the lcbgs , on average @xmath44 mag redder than the sf excesses . for these colors , simple stellar population models for up to solar metallicity @xcite yield minimum stellar ages of @xmath3myr to several gyr .",
    "more extended sf histories ( e.g. @xcite ) lead to higher ages . if extinction is significant in the extended components , outside strong sf , these age limits will decrease .",
    "we will refer to extended components rather than disks as we lack resolved kinematic data for most objects .",
    "morphologies are often disk - like for larger lcbgs ( see [ fig3 ] ) , but ambiguous for small objects which could be either spheroids or disks .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] compares the extended components of the lcbgs to samples of nearby disk galaxies and dwarf galaxies with exponential sbps .",
    "the disk sample by @xcite was chosen because of its completeness of local field disk scalelengths , and the uma - cluster sample by @xcite was added to include disks from higher density environments .",
    "it is evident that the extended components of almost all lcbgs have small scale lengths ( @xmath45kpc ) : at any given luminosity , they are comparable to the local disk galaxies with the smallest @xmath36 . this result is robust against uncertainties of @xmath36 .",
    "the less luminous exponential components are also compatible with those of relatively compact , luminous local dwarf galaxies ( compact des , or stellar hosts of bcds ) .",
    "the only two exceptions are udf0900 ( the lcbg with the largest @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , see also fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , which shows a large lsb component ( @xmath46 , @xmath47kpc ) with an exponential sbp but no spiral features , and a galaxy that may have a truncated disk with a small outer , but larger inner scalelength ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) is affected by psf wings from a bright nucleus and in fact smaller ; see the connected galfit data point . ]",
    "both galaxies have bright central regions that led to their classification as lcbgs .",
    "this structural study of their extended components reveals that @xmath48 of lcbgs at @xmath0 are truly small galaxies . for these ,",
    "suspected large disks with @xmath36 similar to the mw , or the extended low - surface brightness component found in a local lcbg ( ngc7673 ) , can be ruled out down to surface brightnesses @xmath49 ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the discovery of 1 , possibly 2 lcbgs ( @xmath50 ) that are large , disk - like galaxies with bright nuclei supports the scenario of some lcbgs at higher @xmath8 being nuclear starbursts , possibly bulge formation , in large disks .",
    "the available scale lengths help to constrain the passive , post - starburst evolution scenario for lcbgs .",
    "fading of the smaller , brighter sf component will affect the _ overall _ photometric structure of an lcbg .",
    "the older extended components alone will however likely fade more homogeneously and thus largely maintain their scale lengths .",
    "the extended components could fade by several mag , the bluest in principle up to 5 @xmath40 mag from @xmath15 to @xmath51 if they were @xmath52100 myr old simple stellar populations ( see above ) .",
    "however , the scale lengths suggest that lcbgs evolve into local small disks , and different types of larger dwarf and low mass galaxies , assuming that their subsequent evolution does not involve strong disk growth",
    ".    subsequent evolution into local large disks of at least the mw scale length would require an lcbg s extended stellar component to grow substantially , by a factor @xmath53 , typically @xmath54 .",
    "the data can not exclude , but neither evidence , such ongoing growth : for larger lcbgs with a disk - like morphology , we find no evidence of a simple inside - out growth such as bluening at large radii .",
    "for these galaxies , local disks with small scalelengths provide a possible descendant population , so that the substantial disk growth that @xcite propose for similar and somewhat larger lcbgs may not be required . from their linewidths , sizes , and stellar masses ( @xcite ) , disk - like lcbgs could well be lcbg phases of local intermediate - mass ( @xmath55 ) disk galaxies , in agreement with the finding that such galaxies experienced substantial sf since @xmath2 @xcite . around small , hii - galaxy like lcbgs , we do not find signs of forming or pre - existing big disks .",
    "their morphologies and sizes make these galaxies candidate progenitors of small , low mass galaxies in the local universe , such as low mass spheroidals or irregulars .",
    "we finally note that the blue , irregular emission in most lcbgs that are not large disks extends out to @xmath53 to @xmath56 scale lengths of the extended component ( grey insets in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this fractional extent is similar to nearby lcbgs @xcite , where this blue emission is the locus of the ongoing sf and nebular emission .",
    "it appears plausible that irregular emission traces nebular emission also in distant lcbgs .",
    "if so , then nebular emission will sample a sufficient fraction of their velocity field to provide valid mass estimates : @xcite showed that nebular emission line kinematics in nearby lcbgs trace neutral gas kinematics with moderate correction factors ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this lends support to distant lcbgs being mostly low- to intermediate mass galaxies .    in summary ,",
    "most lcbgs at intermediate @xmath8 show brighter , irregular , likely star - forming emission within more extended , regular components with approximately exponential intensity distributions and minimum stellar ages @xmath58 100 myr .",
    "most extended components have scale lengths by factors @xmath59 smaller than local large disks such as the milky way , while 1 or 2 of 26 lcbgs are larger , disk - like galaxies with bright nuclei .",
    "this suggests that @xmath43 of lcbgs are progenitors of small disks , irregulars or low - mass spheroidals in the local universe ; @xmath60 may represent bulge formation within massive disks .",
