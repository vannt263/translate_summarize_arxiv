    "there has been much recent interest in the effects of galactic discs on the lensing cross - sections of galaxies ( maller , flores & primack 1997 ; wang & turner 1997 ; bartelmann & loeb 1998 ; keeton & kochanek 1998 ; koopmans , de bruyn & jackson 1998 ; mller & blain 1998 ) . a gravitationally dominant baryonic disc in the core of a dark matter halo , edge - on to the line of sight to a distant source ,",
    "can significantly increase the mass surface density , and thus the lensing efficiency .    the image geometry produced by an individual lens",
    "can be modified significantly by the presence of an edge - on or almost edge - on disc ; however , the cross - section to multiple imaging is only increased by a factor of about 50per cent when averaged over all disc inclinations .",
    "in contrast , the cross - section to magnifications greater than 10 is expected to be increased by a factor of a few after the same averaging process ( mller & blain 1998 ) .",
    "hence , depending on the abundance and form of evolution of discs in dark matter haloes , the strong lensing optical depth at moderate and large redshifts could be increased very significantly .",
    "bartelmann & loeb ( 1998 ) have also recently discussed this effect .",
    "they note that it will probably not be possible to exploit any enhanced magnification in the optical waveband because the flux densities of the lensed images will be attenuated by dust associated with the disc . for the same reason , maller et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) did not consider the effect of disc lensing on the magnifications of multiple images because of possible differential extinction between the images .",
    "dust extinction is important in the optical waveband ; however , a dusty lensing disc is optically thin in the radio and millimetre / submillimetre wavebands . indeed , because of @xmath0correction effects ( blain & longair 1993 ) , a lensing object is often expected to be fainter than the lensed images in the submillimetre waveband ( blain 1997a , 1998b ) .",
    "hence , any enhanced magnification bias due to the effects of discs would be easy to detect in these wavebands .",
    "existing radio lens surveys , such as the class survey ( browne et al .",
    "1998 ) , appear to show an overabundance of lens candidates that can be identified as highly inclined discs .",
    "the potential importance of submillimetre - wave lens surveys has been discussed for lensing by both clusters ( blain 1997a , 1998a ) and galaxies ( blain 1996 , 1997b , 1998b , c ) .",
    "submillimetre - wave lensing by clusters has now been demonstrated to be a very useful phenomenon ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ) .",

    "as @xmath69 is expected for a 1-kpc source ( peacock 1982 ) , @xmath70 seems to be very reasonable .",
    "larger magnifications may also be possible , at least for any very compact subsample of distant submillimetre - luminous galaxies and quasars , such as the ` extreme starbursts ' imaged by downes & solomon ( 1998 ) .",

    "many forthcoming instruments will be useful for carrying out submillimetre - wave lens surveys .",

    "in addition to following up the sources detected in surveys using single - antenna telescopes ( blain 1998c ) , a deep targeted mia survey of known distant edge - on discs , provided for example by the sloan digital sky survey catalogue ( margon 1998 ) , would be a very powerful way of detecting lensed images of very faint distant submillimetre - wave galaxies .",
