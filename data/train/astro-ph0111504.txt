    "the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al.1987 ; hereafter fp ) is a tight correlation between the effective radius ( r@xmath10 ) , the effective surface brightness ( sb@xmath10 ) , and the central velocity dispersion ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 that is observed to hold for local early - type galaxies ( e / s0 ) . under the assumption that e / s0 are homologous dynamical systems the fp can be interpreted in terms of a power law relation between mass ( @xmath13 ) and mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath14 ) ( treu et al .",
    "2001b and references therein ) .",
    "in recent years , it has been found that a tight fp exists in clusters out to redshift @xmath15 ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ; pahre 1998 ; bender et al .",
    "1998 ; kelson et al .",
    "the modest evolution of the intercept @xmath1 and the tightness of the fp at @xmath16 can be explained in terms of passive evolution and an old age of the stellar populations in cluster e / s0 .",
    "the absence of a dramatic evolution in the slopes @xmath17 and @xmath18 argues against the interpretation of the fp `` tilt '' resulting solely from a mass - age relation .",
    "so far , most of the studies have been focused on the cluster environment . however , the population of galaxies in clusters is likely to evolve with redshift by accretion of field galaxies .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a complete and reliable picture , it is necessary to study the evolution of e / s0 both in clusters and in the field .",
    "in addition , hierarchical clustering models ( e.  g. , kauffmann 1996 ) predict the stellar populations of field e / s0 to be significantly younger than the ones of cluster e / s0 .",
    "the effects of age differences are difficult to observe in the local universe ( bernardi et al.1998 ) , when the typical population ages are large , but are greatly enhanced at intermediate redshift . for these reasons ,",
    "we have embarked on a campaign aimed at measuring the evolution of the fp of _ field _ e / s0 with redshift . in previous papers ( treu et al .  1999 ; 2001a , b ; hereafter t01a , b ) , we have analyzed a sample of 19 e / s0 , finding that a tight fp exists in the field out to @xmath19 and that the evolution of the intercept is marginally faster than in the clusters , indicating a marginally younger age for field galaxies ( see also van dokkum et al .",
    "2001 and kochanek et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "here we present results from a larger sample of 30 e / s0 extended to @xmath20 , increasing dramatically our sensitivity to differences between cluster and field environment , and show that field e / s0 evolve faster than cluster ones at the 95% cl .",
    "in addition , we report on the detection of [ oii]3727 emission in a significant fraction of _ massive _ field e / s0 at intermediate redshift , which we interpret as evidence for secondary episodes of star - formation .",
    "we assume the hubble constant , the matter density , and the cosmological constant to be respectively h@xmath21 km  @xmath22mpc@xmath23 ( @xmath24 when necessary ) , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the sample of e / s0 was selected on the basis of hubble space telescope ( hst ) images taken from the hst - medium deep survey ( mds ; griffiths et al .",
    "the selection criteria are identical to the ones extensively discussed in t01a , except for the color cut ( @xmath27  v@xmath28-i@xmath29 , chosen to select higher redshift e / s0 ; v@xmath28 and i@xmath29 indicate vega magnitudes through hst filters f606w and f814w respectively ) and the magnitude range ( @xmath30  i@xmath29  @xmath31 ) .",
    "the effects of color and magnitude selection are taken into account in the analysis presented here as discussed in t01b .",
    "images are available at the mds web site at http://www.archive.stsci.edu/mds .",
    "morphological classification was performed independently by two of us ( tt , ms ) , based on visual inspection of the images , of the residuals from the fit , and of the luminosity profiles . in particular , since contamination from sa galaxies could bias our results towards a younger age of the stellar populations , we were extremely conservative in rejecting galaxies that showed sign of a spiral disk either in the direct images ( f606w and f814w ) , or in the residuals from the @xmath32 fit .",
    "as independent check of our classification , the bulge - to - total luminosity ratio measured by the mds group for our e / s0 is always larger than 0.6 and typically in the range @xmath33-@xmath34 .",
    "spectra for 16 galaxies were obtained in service mode from april 2000 to march 2001 , using the focal reducer and spectrograph 2 ( fors2 ) at the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "the adopted grism r600 with a @xmath35 wide slit gives a resolution of @xmath36 km  @xmath22 ; exposure times ranged between @xmath37s and @xmath38s . for 10 out of 16",
    "e / s0 observed ( figure  1 ) we obtained a reliable central velocity dispersion ( the success rate depending on observing conditions and redshift , since the observed wavelength range was optimized for the range @xmath39 ) .",
    "the data reduction was very similar to the one described in t01a .",
    "combined with the data of t01b , our total sample consists of 42 galaxies ( in the range @xmath40 ) , 30 of which with measured velocity dispersion ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "panels ( a ) to ( e ) in figure  [ fig : fpb ] show the location in the fp - space of the galaxies in our sample , binned in redshift .",
    "the data ( open symbols ) in the rest - frame b band are compared to the local relation shown as solid line .",
    "the main result is that the brightening at fixed @xmath11 and @xmath42 increases with redshift . by assuming constant slopes",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 we obtain the average evolution of the intercept with redshift plotted as filled pentagons in panel ( f ) .    under the assumption of passive evolution and constant slopes ( t01b ) , the evolution of @xmath1 can be converted into the evolution of the average @xmath14 ratio , which can be read on the right scale of panel ( f ) . modelling the evolution as @xmath43 , where the prime indicates derivative with respect to @xmath8 , a least @xmath44 fit yields @xmath45 . however , in order to avoid biased results , it is crucial to take into account the selection process , for example by applying the montecarlo - bayesian method introduced in t01b , generalized by allowing the scatter to vary as a function of redshift , @xmath46 . in this way , we derive the posterior probability density given the set of observations , p(@xmath47 ) in the notation of t01b , shown in figure  [ fig : prob ] panel ( a ) .",
    "the posterior probability peaks at @xmath48 ( @xmath49 68% limit ) , which corresponds to @xmath50 .",
    "the scatter is constant or at most mildly increasing with redshift .",
    "note that the effects of the magnitude selection limit ( see t01b ) on the measured evolution of the intercept depend on the intrinsic scatter of the fp , and therefore it is important to study the combined probability density .",
    "note also that the galaxies with oii emission ( open stars in panels c and d ) fall slightly above the quiescent ones ( pentagons ) , as expected if their m / l is smaller because of a fraction of young stars .",
    "however , they do not dominate the general trend , since the results change very little if they are removed from the sample ( e.g. @xmath51 from the least @xmath44 fit goes from 0.64 to 0.61 ) .",
    "it is desirable to generalize the treatment by allowing also the slopes to evolve with redshift .",
    "even though a larger sample is needed to this aim , possibly spanning a wider range of parameters , we will try to address this issue by assuming two additional constraints : _",
    "i ) _ the scatter does not change from @xmath52 to @xmath20 and _ ii ) _",
    "@xmath53 ( hence the fp is equivalent to a relation between m and m / l at any redshift ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "we obtain the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob ] panels ( b ) and ( c ) , plotted using @xmath54 ( bender , burstein & faber 1992 ) .",
    "the evolution of the slopes remains highly unconstrained ( panel b ) , but the evolution of the @xmath13 vs @xmath14 relation is better constrained ( panel c ) . for the typical masses in our sample ( @xmath55 )",
    "the derived value of @xmath56 does not depend significantly on the value of @xmath57 , providing a test of the robustness of the measurement . on the other hand ,",
    "the result shown as a solid line in panel ( c ) would indicate that the evolution of @xmath14 with redshift becomes slower as the mass increases ( i.e. for example massive e / s0 are older ) .",
    "more data are needed to confirm these findings .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fpb ] we also show the evolution of @xmath1 predicted by assuming passively evolving single stellar populations .",
    "the best - fitting single burst redshift of formation should be interpreted in terms of a luminosity weighted redshift of formation , since it is clear that a more complex scenario than passive evolution of single coeval stellar populations is needed to explain the present observations ( t01b ) .",
    "finally , cluster data taken from the literature are shown as open squares in figure  [ fig : fpb ] for comparison .",
    "the field fp evolves faster than the cluster one : for the cluster van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2001 ) measure @xmath58 , i.  e. @xmath59 , which falls on the 95% contour in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig : prob ] .",
    "at @xmath60 the emission line [ oii]3727 is redshifted into the wavelength range covered by our instrumental setup .",
    "six out of 27 e / s0 for which [ oii ] is detectable show significant emission ( rest - frame equivalent width ew@xmath6  ) .",
    "if attributed to star - formation , the observed [ oii ] ew correspond to star - formation rates of order @xmath61@xmath62 @xmath63 ( kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "the fraction of e / s0 with sizable star - formation in our sample is significantly larger than the one found for massive e / s0 in clusters at similar redshifts and in the local universe . in figure",
    "[ fig : oii ] we plot the fraction of e / s0 with [ oii ] ew@xmath6  as a function of redshift for field ( pentagons ) and cluster ( squares ) samples taken from the literature .",
    "e / s0 with similar [ oii ] ew , or similarly with relatively blue colors , have been reported previously , suggesting that secondary episodes of star - formation are common at intermediate redshift ( schade et al.1999 ; menanteau et al .",
    "i m et al .",
    "( 2001 ) measured the width of the [ oii ] line for a sample of blue e / s0 at intermediate redshift finding velocity dispersions @xmath64 kms@xmath23 ; based on this measurement they argue that most blue e / s0 are not the progenitors of present - day massive e / s0 , but rather less massive spheroids , for which star - formation is observed also in the local universe ( jansen et al.2000 ) .",
    "our sample adds further information , because it is made of bright ( @xmath65 ) and _ massive _ e / s0 .",
    "the velocity dispersions we obtained via absorption - line kinematics are typical of massive field e / s0 .",
    "in particular , the three objects with significant [ oii ] emission for which velocity dispersion is available have @xmath66 km s@xmath23 . from the fp relationship ,",
    "as measured from our sample , we estimate for the other three galaxies with [ oii ] emission @xmath67 kms@xmath23 .",
    "we can estimate the amount of stellar mass assembled in these secondary burst in the following way .",
    "the probability of observing a burst is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the average number of bursts per galaxy , @xmath70 is the average duration of the burst , and @xmath71 is the interval in cosmic time between @xmath72 and @xmath73 when the burst was observable .",
    "the total average mass in secondary bursts is then : @xmath74 by using the observed values for @xmath75 and @xmath76yr@xmath23 , we estimate that the average stellar mass formed in these bursts is of the order of @xmath77 .",
    "our sample of 30 field e / s0 defines a tight fp out to @xmath78 , with no or modest increase of the scatter with redshift .",
    "the intercept @xmath1 evolves with redshift as @xmath79 , which , interpreted in terms of passive evolution of the stellar populations , implies @xmath80 , i.e. faster than that observed in clusters by other groups ( e.g. @xmath5 van dokkum et al.2001 ) .",
    "in addition , 22% of the galaxies show [ oii ] in emission , with @xmath81 . assuming the emission is due to star - formation",
    ", we estimate that such bursts produce of order @xmath82 of stellar mass between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the existence and tightness of the fp suggest that no major structural changes occur between @xmath20 and @xmath52 . however , we find evidence that some stellar mass is formed at relatively recent time during secondary bursts . although these bursts contribute only a small fraction of the total stellar mass they contribute significantly to the evolution of the observable luminous component .",
    "for example , a scenario where most of the stars formed at @xmath83 and secondary star - formation occurs at @xmath9 could not only explain the evolution of the fp ( t01b ) and the observed [ oii ] emission but could also reconcile the modest evolution of the number density of e / s0 observed to @xmath84 ( schade et al .",
