    "quantum entanglement - a direct consequence of linearity of quantum mechanics and the superposition principle - is one of the most intriguing phenomena distinguishing quantum and classical description of physical systems .",
    "quantum correlated ( e.g. , entangled ) states of composite systems possess features unknown in the classical world , like the seemingly paradoxical nonlocal properties exhibited by the famous einstein - podolsky - rosen analysis of completeness of the quantum theory .",
    "recently , with the development of quantum information theory they came to prominence as the main resource for several applications aiming at speeding up and making more secure information transfers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a novel kind of quantum correlations , called _ quantum discord _ , different from entanglement , but also absent in the macroscopic world , was discovered @xcite , @xcite adding one more element to `` mysteries of quantum mechanics '' as seen from the classical point of view .",
    "although typically a quantum system , as , e.g. , a harmonic oscillator or a hydrogen atom , is described in terms of an infinitely dimensional hilbert space , for most quantum - information applications the restriction to finite dimensions suffices , since usually the active role in information processing play only spin degrees of freedom or only few energy levels are excited during the evolution .    from the mathematical point of view",
    "such finite - dimensional quantum mechanics seems to mount a smaller challenge than in the infinite - dimensional case - the tool of choice is here linear algebra rather than functional analysis .",
    "nevertheless , understanding of correlations in multipartite finite dimensional quantum systems is still incomplete , especially for systems with many components or consisting of particles governed by quantum statistics ( bosons , fermions ) @xcite .",
    "the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics disturbs a bit the simple linear - algebraic approach to quantum mechanics - vectors of state ( elements of a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 ) should be of the unit norm .",
    "obviously , physicist are accustomed to cope with this problem in a natural way by `` normalizing the vector and neglecting the global phase '' .",
    "nevertheless , it is often expedient to implement this prescription by adopting a suitable mathematical structure , the projective space @xmath3 , already from the start .",
    "the projective space is obtained from the original hilbert space @xmath2 by identifying vectors , etc . , and the short one @xmath4 etc .",
    "for elements ( vectors ) of @xmath2 .",
    "] differing by a scalar , complex , non - zero factor , @xmath5 .",
    "we will denote elements ( points ) of @xmath3 by @xmath6 , etc .  and , if we want to identify a particular equivalence class of e vector @xmath7 , by @xmath8 $ ] , etc .    obviously , both approaches , the linear - algebraic ( plus normalization and neglecting the global case ) picture and the projective one are equivalent . following the former we loose linearity ,",
    "so which advantages we could expect instead ?",
    "we answered this question in our paper @xcite , where we propose , by working in the projective space , to apply completely new ( in this context ) techniques to analyze the phenomenon of entanglement .",
    "the approach has given a deeper insight into the unexpectedly rich geometric structure of the space of states and enabled the use of recently developed advanced methods of complex differential , algebraic and symplectic geometry .",
    "the most efficient characterization of quantum correlations is achieved by identifying states that are ` equally correlated ' or , in other words , states that can be mutually transformed _ via _ methods allowed by rules of quantum mechanics without destroying quantum correlations .",
    "this is the case of pure quantum operations that are _ local _ , i.e.  restricted to act independently on each subsystem . as required by quantum mechanics , such operations are unitary in the relevant hilbert space @xmath2 , but form only a subgroup of the whole group @xmath9 as limited by the restriction to subsystems . for these reasons",
    "they are called _ local unitary _ ( lu ) operations .",
    "a complementary insight is provided by adding more operations , like measurements performed locally , i.e. , each restricted to a single subsystem , and possible communication among subsystems _ via _ classical means of communication .",
    "such operations are dubbed locc - _ local operations with classical communication_. they usually destroy purely quantum correlations , but in any case do not increase them , so if one state can be transformed to another one _ via _ locc transformation , the latter is not more ( and usually less ) correlated than the former .",
    "this allows quantifying correlations by constructing _",
    "entanglement measures _ , quantities characterizing states that remain unchanged under lu operations and do not increase under locc ones .",
    "technically it is convenient to group together states related to each other by invertible stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) two states , @xmath10 and @xmath7 belong to the same slocc class if both transformations , @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be achieved by means of locc with non - zero probability .",
    "hence , in general , if two states belong to two distinct slocc classes , they have different correlation properties and might be not exchangeable for achieving the same quantum informational tasks .    as mentioned above the lu operations",
    "form a subgroup @xmath13 of the whole unitary group @xmath9 of the relevant hilbert space @xmath2 ( since the global phase of a state is irrelevant , we can use the special unitary group @xmath14 instead ) .",
    "the slocc also form a group @xmath15 that happens to be the complexification of @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath13 , which is compact as a subgroup of the unitary group , @xmath15 is not compact .",
    "the exact forms of @xmath13 and , consequently , @xmath15 depend on the problem in question ( number and dimensionality of subsystems , distinguishability of particles constituting them ) .",
    "the actions of @xmath13 and @xmath15 on @xmath2 are naturally and easily transferred to the projective space @xmath3 _ via _ @xmath17=[u\\psi]$ ] .",
    "the projective space has a reach geometrical structure .",
    "in particular , in a natural way , it is a khler manifold , i.e. , a complex symplectic riemannian manifold on which all three structures are compatible .",
    "symplecticity means that it can be treated as a kind of a classical phase space for a hamiltonian system .",
    "the action of a group on such a manifold reflects symmetries of the dynamical system , and the methods of analysis of such systems can be borrowed from classical mechanics . in modern formulation of classical mechanics ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) one employs the full power of symplectic geometry .",
    "so far the above outlined geometric treatment of correlations was restricted to pure states .",
    "there exists , however , its natural extension to mixed states . instead of the projective space",
    "@xmath3 one considers another manifold - an orbit of the whole @xmath14 group through a chosen mixed state ( i.e. , the set of all mixed density matrices obtained for the chosen one @xmath18 _ via _ by unitary conjugations , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , in other words all density matrices with the same spectrum .",
    "such an orbit posses a natural khlerian structure given by the so called kirillov - kostant - souriau form .",
    "this observation allows to apply the same geometric techniques as in the pure - state case .",
    "as outlined in previous sections , one of the basic problems in the theory of quantum correlations is the classification of states with respect to local operations performed independently on subsystems of a given system by two classes of such operations lu and slocc , both being groups acting on the space of states , a unitary one @xmath13 and its complexification @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the space of pure states is the projective space @xmath3 , and for mixed states , the space of spectral ( i.e. , possessing the same eigenvalues ) density matrices .",
    "the underlying hilbert space for a composite system has a form the tensor product of the hilbert spaces of the subsystems or , in the case of indistinguishable components , an appropriate ( anti)-symmetrization of the product .    in both cases of pure and mixed states",
    "the above described spaces of states spaces have a natural geometric structure of a symplectic manifolds ( see appendix for a brief description of relevant mathematical concepts used in the paper ) .    for applications in the theory of quantum correlations we will consider the following particular instances .",
    "1 .   @xmath21 ( the complex projective space ) , and 1 .   for pure states of @xmath22 distinguishable particles",
    "the hilbert space is the tensor product , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the @xmath25-dimensional hilbert space of @xmath26-th particle , the action of @xmath27 on @xmath28 is defined in the natural way in terms of the tensor product , i.e. @xmath29 , the complexified group is thus @xmath30 , and the lie algebras read @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; 2 .   for pure states of @xmath22 @xmath33-state bosons @xmath34 ( the @xmath22-th symmetrized tensor power of @xmath35 ) , where @xmath35 is the hilbert space of a single boson , the group @xmath36 acts diagonally , @xmath37 , and , consequently , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; 3 .   for pure states of @xmath22 @xmath33-state fermions , @xmath41 ( the @xmath22-th anti - symmetrized tensor power of @xmath35 ) , where @xmath35 is the hilbert space of a single fermion",
    ", the group @xmath36 again acts diagonally ( i.e , by the same element of the group on each factor in the anti - symmetrized product ) , @xmath38 , algebras @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",

    "in fact density matrices are not exactly elements of respective lie algebras since the latter are traceless .",
    "nevertheless a shift by a constant multiple of the identity yields the desired normalization to @xmath44 , and the requirement of positivity restricts them to a subset of so ` shifted ' lie algebra ( see below ) .",

    "in all above considered cases the momentum map relates a state to its one - particle reduced density matrices .",
    "this observation paves a way of relating the local unitary equivalence to the properties of the reduced states or , in other words , to properties of the momentum map .",
    "since @xmath13 is a compact group its orbits are closed . to check",
    "if two states belong to the same orbit it suffices to find the ( finitely generated @xcite ) ring of @xmath13-invariant polynomials , i.e.polynomials that are constant on orbits of @xmath13 , since each orbit is uniquely determined by the values of all generating polynomials in an an arbitrary point of it .",
    "the equivariant momentum map , @xmath58 , maps @xmath13-orbits in the space of states @xmath59 onto orbits of the adjoint action of @xmath13 in @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , each @xmath60-invariant polynomial @xmath61 on @xmath43 , when composed with @xmath62 , gives a @xmath13-invariant polynomial @xmath63 on @xmath59 .",
    "the invariant polynomials for the adjoint action of @xmath64 are generated by traces of powers not larger than @xmath65 of @xmath66 . combining this with the fact that the momentum map is given by reduced one - particle density matrices",
    "we conclude that traces of their powers are @xmath13-invariant polynomials on @xmath59 .",
    "if the pre - image of every adjoint orbit from @xmath67 consists of exactly one @xmath13-orbit in @xmath59 , a @xmath13-orbit on @xmath59 ( i.e. , a set of equally correlated states ) can be identified by the traces of powers of the reduced one - particle density matrices . since the traces of powers of a matrix determine its spectrum ( and _ vice versa _ ) we can decide upon local unitary equivalence of states by examining the spectra of their reduced one - particle density matrices , hence , in principle by measurements restricted performed independently in each laboratory only .",
    "alas , the above described situation is quite exceptional .",
    "typically many @xmath13-orbits are mapped onto one adjoint orbit .",
    "hence , even if one - particle density matrices of two states have the same spectra we need additional @xmath13-invariant polynomials to decide their @xmath13-equivalence @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the number of the additional polynomials characterizes , in a certain sense , the amount of additional information that can not be obtained from local measurements , but needs to be inferred form non - local ones , i.e. , involving effectively more than one subsystem .",
    "the whole problem can be looked upon as a quantum version of the classical ` marginal problem ' , where we try to recover a probability distribution from its marginals ( here , recover a quantum state from its reduced density matrices ) @xcite .",
    "let us , however , concentrate for a moment on cases ( exceptional , as it follows from the above remarks ) , when we infer local unitary equivalence upon examining the spectra of the reduced states .      as pointed above",
    ", the situation when the set of @xmath13-invariant polynomials on @xmath59 is given by the composition of @xmath68-invariant polynomials on @xmath43 with the momentum map @xmath58 occurs only when the pre - image of every adjoint orbit from @xmath69 is exactly one @xmath13-orbit in @xmath59 .",
    "let us thus consider the fibre of the momentum map @xmath62 over @xmath70 , @xmath71 i.e. the set of all points in @xmath59 that are mapped to the point @xmath72 by the momentum map .",
    "the position of @xmath73 with respect to the orbit @xmath74 is of the key importance for the above situation .",
    "orbits of @xmath13 in @xmath59 are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the adjoint orbits in @xmath75 if and only if the fibres @xmath76 are contained in orbits @xmath74 , since in this case all points mapped to @xmath72 are on the same orbit ( that can be thus identified , when we know @xmath72 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the tangent space @xmath77 at @xmath78 is @xmath79-orthogonal to the tangent space @xmath80 at the same point @xmath78 , i.e. , for each @xmath81 and @xmath82 we have @xmath83 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath84 , @xmath85 , be a basis in the lie algebra @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding vector fields @xmath87 at @xmath88 ( c.f .",
    "eq .  ( [ eq : fundvfield ] ) in the appendix ) span the tangent space @xmath89 to the orbit through @xmath88 at @xmath88 . on the other hand ,",
    "the fiber @xmath73 is a common level set of the functions @xmath90 , @xmath91 which means that the derivatives of @xmath90 vanish on the tangent to @xmath73 , @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",

    "the above reasoning clearly does not depend on the choice of a particular point in @xmath73 , i.e. , as announced , @xmath106    a submanifold @xmath107 of a symplectic manifold @xmath59 is called coisotropic if for arbitrary @xmath108 we have @xmath109 .",
    "we conclude thus that if @xmath110 is coisotropic then @xmath111 . indeed from ( [ fact1 ] ) and the coisotropy of @xmath110 at each @xmath112 we have @xmath113 .",
    "hence , in this case examining whether some @xmath78 belongs to @xmath110 ( and , consequently whether @xmath78 and @xmath88 are lu - equivalent ) reduces to checking whether their corresponding one - particle reduced states have the same spectra @xcite .    in order to characterize all systems",
    "for which lu - equivalence can be decided using the spectra of one - particle density matrices we need to identify those whose ( at least ) generic @xmath13-orbit is coisotropic . as it turns out ,",
    "such systems need to satisfy some group theoretic conditions @xcite . to reach the final solution we have to study not only the action of @xmath13 but also of its complexification @xmath114 on @xmath59 .",
    "note that the group @xmath15 is much bigger than @xmath13 and therefore the number of @xmath15-orbits is smaller than number of @xmath13-orbits in @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath15 has an open dense orbit on @xmath59 then we call @xmath59 _ almost homogenous manifold _ @xcite .",
    "such @xmath59 has a finite number of @xmath15-orbits .",
    "the almost homogenity of @xmath59 with respect to @xmath15-action is a necessary condition for deciding @xmath13-equivalence on @xmath59 using the momentum map @xcite .",
    "it is , however , not a sufficient condition , what can be seen from the example of the three - qubit system , where there are exactly @xmath115 orbits of @xmath116 action , but states @xmath117 and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is an orthonormal basis in @xmath120 , satisfy @xmath121 but are not @xmath13-equivalent as they belong to different @xmath15-orbits @xcite .",
    "an important role in the formulation of the sufficient condition is played by the borel subgroup of the group @xmath15 . by definition a borel subgroup",
    "@xmath122 is a maximal connected solvable subgroup of the group @xmath15 .",
    "for example , for @xmath123 , the group of upper - triangular matrices , that is a stabilizer of the standard full flag in @xmath124 , ( i.e. , a collection of subspaces with the dimension growing by one , such that the given one includes all subspaces with smaller dimensions ) , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a basis in @xmath2 , is an example of a borel subgroup .",
    "generally , any two borel subgroups are conjugated by an element of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , in the considered example , @xmath122 is a borel subgroup of @xmath15 if and only if when it stabilizes some standard full flag .",
    "the crucial notion for the @xmath13-equivalence problem is the notion of a _",
    "spherical space_. if @xmath15 is a group and @xmath127 its subgroup we call @xmath128 , i.e. , the space obtained from @xmath15 by identifying points connected by elements of @xmath127 , a _",
    "g - homogenous space_. in this space the group @xmath15 acts in a natural way , simply by the group product followed by identification of elements connected by elements of @xmath127 , hence we can consider actions of @xmath15 or its subgroups on @xmath129 , in particular of a borel subgroup .",
    "this leads to the following definition .",
    "a @xmath15-homogenous space @xmath128 is a _",
    "spherical homogenous space _ if and only if some ( and therefore every ) borel subgroup @xmath130 has an open dense orbit in @xmath129 .",
    "now observe that an orbit of @xmath15 in the initially considered manifold @xmath59 through a point @xmath88 can be identified with some @xmath15-homogenous space .",
    "indeed we can take as @xmath127 the subgroup that stabilizes @xmath88 , than all other points on the orbit are obtained by actions of @xmath15 that effectively move @xmath88 .",
    "all these considerations allow the following definition .",
    "if @xmath15 has an open dense orbit @xmath128 in @xmath59 and @xmath129 is a spherical homogenous space then @xmath59 is called a _",
    "spherical embedding _ of @xmath128 .",
    "such @xmath59 is also called _ almost homogenous spherical space _ ( with respect to the action of @xmath15 ) .",
    "its relevance stems from the following brion s theorem @xcite ,    [ brion result](brion ) let @xmath13 be a connected compact lie group acting on connected compact khler manifold @xmath131 by a hamiltonian action and let @xmath132 .",

    "the group @xmath13 is the local unitary group , i.e. , the group of the product of the local unitaries .",
    "the conclusion is that if the relevant @xmath136 ( the space of states of the whole system ) is a spherical embedding of an open orbit of the corresponding group of the product of the local special linear groups ( i.e.  the complexification of the local unitary group ) then lu - equivalence can be decided upon spectra of the reduced one - particle states .    as it should be clear from the above presented reasoning we thus need to find open dense orbit of @xmath15 in @xmath3 and",

    "these spaces have a natural geometric ( khler ) structure , and therefore in particular they are symplectic manifolds . since the action of compact group on @xmath59 preserves the symplectic structure there exists the momentum map . in the cases considered here , it assigns to a state of @xmath22 particles its reduced one - particle density matrices , and therefore is directly related to partial trace over @xmath368 particles .",

    "* what are obstacles in the case when such an information is insufficient , i e. , when the lu - equivalence can not be established upon examining spectra of reduced matrices ? * how many additional invariant polynomials ( except those directly derived from one - qubit density matrices ) are needed to solve the lu - equivalence problem ?",
    "how his number depends on the spectra of reduced matrices ? * how to classify states under slocc operations ?",

    "another direction of future research may concentrate on looking for other ways to identify critical orbits important for slocc equivalence , for example by employing other approach to stratification described in section  [ sec : gita ] @xcite .",
    "it should allow moving a state to the appropriate critical orbit case a one parameter slocc subgroup and thus have a clear operational meaning since one could decide to which class a state belongs by acting on it by a one parameter family of slocc ( hence physical ) operations .",
