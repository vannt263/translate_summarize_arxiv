    "very good agreements are to be noticed .",
    "a deeper insight to the kinematics of the process can be obtained by analyzing the reduced fragments velocity correlations @xcite .",
    "fragments with @xmath76 as in @xcite have been used for constructing the correlations .",
    "this observable was proven to reflect subtle topological features of the fragmentation events .",
    "the beginning of the correlation function is often called `` coulomb hole '' and reflects the strength of the coulomb repulsion between fragments ( obviously related to the size of the freeze - out volume ) but , as shown in the next section , is also related to the amount of radial expansion .",
    "good agreement between calculations and experimental data can be observed here as well ( see fig .",
    "while in the case of the gd+u reaction the experimental velocity correlations are well reproduced in both freeze - out hypotheses , in the case of the first reaction a better agreement with experimental data is obtained for the hypothesis ( 2 ) ( `` without hard - core '' ) .",
    "in fact , this result is natural and suggests that deviations from the spherical fragments with hard - core interaction idealization ( deformed fragments , surface diffusivity , etc . )",
    "are present in real multifragmentation .",
    "the deviation effect is stronger in the case of the xe+sn since the corresponding equilibrated system is smaller and , therefore the fragment partitions are more symmetric ( as shown in @xcite , the free volume is smaller for more symmetric partitions and larger for more asymmetric ones ) . the simultaneous description of both average fragment kinetic energies as a function of the fragment charge and of the reduced velocity correlations is remarkable and reflects a good description of the event topology . here",

    "this tends to indicate a relatively small `` region '' , specific to each reaction in which the parameters of the _ real _ equilibrated nuclear source are situated .",
    "quite small differences from one hypothesis to the other seem to be present in the case of the freeze - out volume .",
    "this result may look intriguing given the fact that freeze - out volume is directly related to both working hypotheses . in reality",
    ", the relatively large freeze - out volumes obtained are minimizing the influence of the hard - core interactions to the free - volume ( @xmath67 ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the values of of the freeze - out volume being mainly dictated by the coulomb interaction ( the remaining quantity entering the system s density of states depending on the freeze - out volume ) . unlike the free volume which in models can only be more or less arbitrary parametrized , coulomb interaction can be accurately evaluated for each fragment partition ( either by explicitly accounting for the interfragment interaction , or by employing the wigner - seitz approach ) .",
    "this contributes to the solidity of the present evaluations .",
    "the differences in the excitation energies corresponding to the two hypotheses are due to the coulomb energy variation from one case to another , caused by the slightly different values of the freeze - out volumes ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "for example , in the gd+u case the energy variation ( from ( 1 ) to ( 2 ) ) is slightly larger than in the xe+sn case since the _ relative _ variation of the freeze out volume is larger as well .",
    "freeze - out volume is always smaller in the working hypothesis ( 2 ) .",
    "this is related to the different dependencies @xmath77 resulting from the underlying hypotheses ( more symmetric partitions and thus a more advanced fragmentation are specific to the without hardcore case and therefore both the freeze - out volume and excitation energies need to be smaller in the second hypothesis ) .",

    "while many fragment size and kinetic observables were simultaneously fitted in order to deduce the parameters of the equilibrated sources corresponding to the two reactions , the following question arises : are they unique ?",
    "we address this question in the present section .",
    "we start with the remark that the size of the equilibrated source appears to be dictated by the @xmath75 distribution .",
    "we illustrate this by representing in fig .",
    "6 the @xmath71 distributions corresponding to three different sources : ( 215,90 ) , ( 230,94 ) and ( 245,102 ) .",
    "their excitation energies ( 5.4 , 5.3 , 5.3 mev / u respectively ) are chosen such as to insure a good fit of the charge distributions corresponding to the xe+sn at 32 mev / u reaction ; their freeze - out volume ( @xmath78 ) is chosen as to provide a good description of the @xmath79 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 distributions .",
    "it can be easily observed that the best fit on the data is given by the ( 230,94 ) source .",
    "a smaller source deviates the maximum of the @xmath71 distribution to the left while a larger one deviates it to the right ( see fig .",
    "the freeze - out volume of the equilibrated sources appears to be dictated by the distributions of the largest , second largest and third largest charge in one fragmentation event .",
    "obviously , these distributions provide a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a given fragment partition .",
    "the degree of asymmetry of a partition is influenced by the freeze - out volume through both the coulomb interaction and the free volume @xcite .",
    "this fact is evidenced in fig . 7 where multiplicities of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are represented for two different freeze out volumes in the freeze - out hypotheses ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as follows . for the first hypothesis the source was considered ( 230,94 ) at two different volumes : @xmath80 and @xmath81 while for the second one the source was taken to be ( 220,92 ) at other two different volumes @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the corresponding excitation energies are taken such as a good reproduction of the experimental charge distributions corresponding to the xe+sn reaction at 32 mev / u to be achieved ( the excitations energies are respectively : 6.4 , 5.3 , 6.1 , 4.78 mev / u ) .",
    "it can be noticed that deviations to the left of the maxima ( indicating more asymmetric fragment partitions ) of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 distributions are occurring when the freeze - out volume is decreased .",
    "this behavior can be observed irrespective to the considered freeze - out hypothesis or to the chosen mass of the source .",
    "while , as demonstrated by fig .",
    "7 lower values of the freeze - out volume are leading to deviations of the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 calculated distributions from the corresponding experimental data , larger values of the freeze - out volume will result in smaller excitation energies and larger flow energies leading to deviations from the experimental data of the kinematic observables represented in fig .",
    "5 .    given the previously described monotonical behavior of the `` distance '' from the calculated curves to the experimental ones , and also the very good reproduction of all the considered experimental observables for the parameters ( given in table i ) corresponding to the case in which the @xmath71 distribution is fitted best ( see fig .",
    "6 ) it results that the corresponding sets of parameters provide the global minimum of the associated @xmath84 function .",
    "indeed , choosing a different value of @xmath85 would generate a deviation of the @xmath71 from the experimental one and , obviously the global reproduction of the data would be worst . finally , the way in which the radial flow parameters @xmath86 and @xmath32 are influencing the experimental data fitting is presented in fig . 8 for the nuclear source ( 230,94 ) ,",
    "@xmath87 , @xmath88 mev / u and the first working freeze - out hypothesis .",
    "three different cases are being considered : ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 mev / u ) , ( @xmath91 , @xmath90 mev / u ) and ( @xmath89 , @xmath92 mev / u ) . as shown in fig .",
    "8 the @xmath32 parameter defining the flow profile appears to influence the location of the maximum of the average kinetic energy versus @xmath74 ( @xmath93 ) and the value of the flow energy the height of the @xmath93 dependency .",
    "smaller effects are to be noticed in the reduced velocity correlation function and they concern mainly the width of the `` coulomb hole '' .",
    "the effects are intuitive : smaller flow leads to a narrower coulomb hole while larger ones lead to a larger hole .",
    "the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 mev / u appear to give the best description of the kinetic experimental data corresponding to the xe+sn at 36 mev / u reaction",

    "in summary , the microcanonical multifragmentation model @xcite has been further refined and improved . conservation of angular momentum has been included .",
    "also , in order to provide events similar with the experimental ones , the model is completed with a stage of generation of momenta for the primary break - up fragments .",

    "could be simultaneously fitted allowing thus the identification of the equilibrated sources parameters corresponding to the two reactions .",
    "two different break - up scenarios were used for performing the analysis .",
    "the two types of calculations give close results for each of the considered reactions suggesting independence of the obtained results on the particular hypothesis .",
    "this is due to the fact that for relatively large values of the freeze - out volume ( such as those obtained by fitting the data , 8 - 9 @xmath56 ) the influence of the hard - core is small and thus the results are rather independent on the extent to which these effects are included in a specific @xmath67 parametrization . in this case , the values of the freeze - out volume are dictated by the coulomb interaction ( accurately evaluated independently to any model assumptions ) which makes the evaluation particularly robust . for each reaction a narrow freeze - out volume region was identified ( 8.5 - 9 @xmath56 for xe+sn and 8 - 8.5 @xmath56 for gd+u ) . by analyzing the way in which variations of the model parameters are influencing the deviation between the calculated curves and the experimental ones , it is proved that the set of the parameters providing the best fit to the data is unique ( within inherent uncertainties ) .",
    "it is shown that the size of the source is dictated by the @xmath75 distributions while its freeze - out radius can be deduced by fitting the experimental distributions of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 and the kinematic observables .",
