    "<S> , @xmath169 is approximately @xmath170 @xcite for a device with @xmath171 when @xmath172 . </S>",
    "<S> the window that detectors need to open for photons is approximately @xmath173 , requiring the dark count rate being lower than @xmath174 . </S>",
    "<S> the dark count rate of the best silicon avalanche photodiode is about @xmath175 hz . </S>",

    "<S> the mechanism behind the amplification is the superposition between the number state @xmath38 and the state @xmath84 ( unnormalized ) of the postselection pointer . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we proposed two different schemes for experimental implementations with optomechanical system , and show that the amplification that occurs at time near @xmath75 is important for bad cavities with non - sideband resolved regime , * which means that our proposed schemes are feasible to observe the impact of a single photon on a room - temperature mechanical oscillator under current experimental condition . * * moreover , we have provided enough theoretical toolbox @xcite to amplify the weaker effect in one - photon weak - coupling optomechanics , which may be employed to explore the faint gravitational effect . *    </S>",
