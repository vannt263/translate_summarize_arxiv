    "it is well - known that a wide variety of social networks have the so - called _ small world _",
    "property ; networks of size @xmath1 have diameter @xmath2 , meaning that between any two nodes there exists a path of size @xmath2 .",
    "this property is also shared by sparse random graphs ; however , random graphs lack several other important properties of real - world networks , such as clustering and heavy - tailed degree distributions ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "another property of social networks which distinguishes them from random graphs , and which has received somewhat less attention , is their _",
    "navigability_. that is , not only do short paths exist , but it is easy to find them using only local information .",
    "the pioneering work of milgram in the 1960s @xcite showed that people can , at least some of the time , find short paths to other distant people by pursuing the greedy strategy where they pass the message to whichever of their own acquaintances they feel is `` closest '' to the target recipient .",
    "this experiment has recently been repeated using e - mail networks  @xcite . in a random graph , although a short path exists , a local algorithm must be lucky to find it as it can do little better than a random walk on the network .",
    "kleinberg  @xcite addressed the issue of navigability by considering a small - world model consisting of a @xmath3-dimensional lattice with long - range links added to it . unlike the watts - strogatz model  @xcite in which the long - range links are uniformly distributed , in the kleinberg model pairs of nodes a distance @xmath4 apart are connected with some probability @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and the number of outgoing links per node is fixed . while a finite - dimensional lattice is obviously a gross oversimplification of the social spaces in which we live , or the conceptual spaces in which one web page seems `` closer '' to another , this model captures the essential features of the navigation problem : how can we minimize the routing time given local information about some metric ?",
    "kleinberg studied the performance of the greedy algorithm , in which each node passes the message to whichever of its neighbors , either local or long - range , that is closest to the destination on the underlying lattice .",
    "he showed that if @xmath7 this algorithm achieves a routing time of @xmath0 on lattices of size @xmath1 .",
    "however , if @xmath8 , the routing time grows as @xmath9 for some @xmath10 . note that if when @xmath7 , we integrate over spheres of radius @xmath4 , we find that the distribution of link lengths is @xmath11 , with a cutoff when @xmath4 reaches the system size ; this distribution provides the right mix of long- , medium- , and short - range links for the greedy algorithm to quickly `` zero in '' on its destination .",
    "similar results have been obtained for the case where the underlying graph is a tree , representing a hierarchical structure , or an overlapping set of trees representing multiple affiliations in society  @xcite .    while kleinberg s work largely characterizes the",
    "properties a network needs to have to be navigable , it leaves open the question of how or why networks might evolve these properties . indeed , the topology of a social network is constantly being modified by its members . if , whenever these members find it difficult to search the network , they modify their own connections in an effort to make future searches easier , this dynamical process should make the network more navigable over time .    in this paper , we consider a dynamic network model inspired by surfers on the web , each of whom controls the outgoing links from their home page .",
    "we start at a source node @xmath12 , and choose a random destination node @xmath13 . based on the ( metric ) distance between @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", we set a threshold @xmath14 on the number of ( topological ) steps we feel the journey should take .",
    "if after @xmath14 steps we have not reached our destination , we stop searching , and rewire @xmath12 s long - range link to the place where we gave up . in the human - friendship network",
    ", this might correspond to gaining new acquaintances in the course of a search ; on the web , it corresponds to creating a bookmark / linking to the relevant pages , which other surfers can then use  @xcite .",
    "our main result is that this process does indeed cause the distribution of link lengths to converge to a power law @xmath15 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath16 varies with lattice size , and differs somewhat from kleinberg s prediction @xmath17 .",
    "we believe this is due to finite - size effects ; to support this belief , we directly construct networks with power - law link length distributions ( as opposed to rewiring them ) , measure the exponent @xmath18 that minimizes the routing time , and find that it converges rather slowly to @xmath3 as @xmath19 , roughly as @xmath20 .",
    "however , even though the exponents differ somewhat , our rewiring process produces networks whose routing times match or improve those of kleinberg s optimum .",
    "other types of dynamical models have been studied ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the model discussed here appears to be the first to optimize for navigability .",
    "one restriction of kleinberg s model of a social space consists of a @xmath3-dimensional lattice of size @xmath1 , where each node @xmath21 is connected to its @xmath22 nearest neighbors and has a single long - range link to a node @xmath23 , chosen with @xmath6 where @xmath24 is the manhattan distance ( the @xmath25 norm ) .",
    "such networks are denoted @xmath26 in  @xcite ; here the two @xmath27s indicate the radius of the local and the number of long - range links per node .",
    "our goal is to show that our rewiring process causes networks with a range of initial link length distributions to converge to this form , where @xmath28 and is close to kleinberg s prediction @xmath17 .",
    "we report here on where @xmath29 , for which we can feasibly study networks of size up to @xmath30 ; our results for @xmath31 are qualitatively similar .    in each round of the rewiring process , we choose the source node @xmath12 uniformly , and choose the destination @xmath13 according to a _ demand distribution _ @xmath32 .",
    "one method of selection is to choose a distance @xmath4 according to a distribution @xmath33 , and then choose @xmath13 randomly from among the nodes that satisfy @xmath34 . here",
    ", we take @xmath33 to be uniform , which for @xmath29 means that @xmath13 is simply a uniformly random node ; we comment in the conclusions on the effect of other demand distributions .",
    "starting at @xmath12 , the greedy algorithm produces a path @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the routing time , and where for each @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the outgoing neighbor of @xmath39 that minimizes @xmath40 ( with ties broken randomly ) .",
    "the rewiring process works as follows : if @xmath41 , i.e. ,  if the greedy algorithm reaches some @xmath39 with @xmath42 , then we discontinue the search and change @xmath12 s outgoing link to point to @xmath39 .    in our experiments ,",
    "we choose the threshold @xmath14 uniformly at random from the interval @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "such a naive selection avoids making assumptions about the network s size , performance or topology .",
    "in particular , it avoids assuming the @xmath0 routing time which both the rewired networks and kleinberg s networks achieve .    for our initial conditions ,",
    "the link length distributions have exponent @xmath44 ranging from @xmath45 , a uniform distribution as in the watts - strogatz model , to @xmath46 , where all the `` long - range links '' are simply self - loops .",
    "we run @xmath47 rounds per node of the rewiring process ; that is , @xmath48 times we choose nodes @xmath49 , run the greedy algorithm from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and rewire if @xmath50 .",
    "we then compare the final link length distribution to kleinberg s optimum @xmath11 .     after running the rewiring process until @xmath51 .",
    "the initial graphs had @xmath52 , i.e. ,  only self - loops . ]     for a range of initial link length exponents @xmath44 , where @xmath53 . at @xmath47 increases",
    ", @xmath16 converges to @xmath54 regardless of the value of @xmath44 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : logbinned ] illustrates the resulting distributions for networks of size @xmath55 and @xmath52 .",
    "we see that after @xmath48 rounds ( we describe our choice of @xmath47 in the next section ) the rewiring process has built a power - law distribution of link lengths , @xmath15 with @xmath56 respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : variousa ] shows that a range of initial distributions converge to the same final distribution .",
    "starting with initial exponents @xmath44 ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath57 , the exponent of the rewired link length distributions all converge to @xmath58 ( here @xmath59 ) as the rewiring continues .",
    "while our rewiring process produces a power - law link length distribution , the exponent is noticeably different from the value @xmath60 ( more generally , @xmath17 ) which kleinberg proved in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "notably , figure  [ fig : variousa ] shows that networks with an initial exponent @xmath61 actually move away from this value as they are rewired .",
    "this deflection appears to be due to finite - size effects , and in fact the exponent @xmath18 that minimizes the routing time on finite lattices turns out to be rather different from kleinberg s value even at reasonably large @xmath1 .",
    "we examined system sizes over six orders of magnitude , @xmath62 . for each size , we constructed networks with @xmath63 ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath27 , and measured the mean routing time @xmath64 over @xmath65 trials for each @xmath63 .",

    "mean routing time @xmath36 for networks with @xmath71 .",
    "shown is a fit to @xmath72 of the form @xmath73 . ]    however , while @xmath16 differs from @xmath3 ( and from @xmath18 ) our rewired networks achieve a mean routing time equivalent to networks with exponent @xmath18 , and better than those with exponent @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : static - meanrouting ] compares the mean routing times for the three types of networks .",
    "all three are closely fit with a curve of the form @xmath74 , just as kleinberg s analysis predicts  @xcite .    of course , the routing time of the network depends on the number of rewiring rounds . in figure",
    "[ fig : relaxtime ] , we show the number of rounds per node @xmath47 required to achieve a mean routing time @xmath75 which is only @xmath76 greater than @xmath77 , i.e. ,  the routing time of a network with exponent @xmath18 .",
    "this _ rewiring time _ grows as @xmath78 rounds per node , or @xmath79 rounds total .    ,",
    "i.e. ,  the number of rounds per node the rewiring process needs to achieve a routing time @xmath80 , within @xmath76 of that of a network with exponent @xmath18 .",
    "the solid line is a fit of the form @xmath81 . ]",
    "kleinberg  @xcite explored the navigability of small - world networks built on an underlying @xmath3-dimensional space . in the limit of infinite size , he found the mean routing time in minimized by a power - law of link lengths with exponent @xmath7 @xcite . here , we have explained how might develop such a distribution over time , by a decentralized rewiring process that relies only on local information ( and is even ignorant of the size of the network ) .",
    "this process has a natural interpretation : the topology of a social network is constantly being modified by its members , who update their personal connections as they explore and navigate the network .",
    "if a becomes frustrated because the journey to a destination takes too long , they can be expected to change their to make similar journeys more quickly in the future .",
    "our results show that rewiring causes a wide range of initial topologies to converge to a power - law distribution of link lengths , very similar to kleinberg s .",
    "the exponent @xmath16 we obtain differs significantly from @xmath3 , its optimal value on infinite lattices .",
    "we attribute this deflection to finite size effects which cause the optimal exponent @xmath18 to converge polylogarithmically as @xmath19 .",
    "however , the rewired network achieves the same mean routing time as power - law networks with exponent @xmath18 , and better routing times than those with @xmath17 . specifically , the mean routing time as a function of system size is @xmath0 as predicted by kleinberg s analysis .",
    "the number of rounds of the rewiring process needed to achieve this routing time grows as a low - degree polynomial of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to creating and maintaining a power - law distribution of link lengths , we believe this rewiring process to be _",
    "adaptive_. for instance , we conjecture that if new nodes are added to the network , or if certain nodes or links are removed , it will dynamically optimize for these new situations .",
    "we also believe , based on preliminary results , that if the demand distribution @xmath32 is not uniform , e.g.  if certain destinations are more popular than others , or if the source and the destination are correlated ( both of which are true in any real network ) , that it will optimize routing times for the source - destination pairs that appear more frequently .",
    "these adaptive properties would be particular useful in networks where nodes are constantly coming on- and off - line and where the demand of each destination rises and falls over time , such as live peer - to - peer networks , distributed sensor networks or massively parallel computers .",
    "our discussion contemplates a `` social space '' consisting of a finite - dimensional lattice , an obviously poor model for the complex social spaces we routinely navigate .",
    "an interesting study would be an analogous rewiring process for networks whose underlying structure is hierarchical  @xcite , involves multiple group affiliations  @xcite or is otherwise structured , as in the peer - to - peer network freenet  @xcite with the modifications described in  @xcite .",
