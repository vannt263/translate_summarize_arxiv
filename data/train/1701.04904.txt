    "more importantly , compared with the condensed - matter or atomic physics , cavity array has a unique property that the fundamental many - body phenomena depend crucially on the intrinsic atom - photon coupling strength @xcite .    for the weak and moderately - strong coupling regimes ,",
    "the counter - rotating terms of the single - site hamiltonian are usually neglected by employing the rotating - wave approximation . as a result",
    ", the property of cavity array is governed by a jaynes - cummings - lattice model mjhf08,aah12,ss13,img14,cn17 .",
    "since this jaynes - cummings - lattice model preserves a global excitation number , a series of mott insulator ( mi ) phase of photons form a lobe structure and a second - order superfluid(sf)-mi phase transition take place across the edge of each lobe .",
    "this mott - lobe structure makes it a photonic counterpart of the bose - hubbard model @xcite , which simulates massive bosons in lattice and also supports a similar lobe structure .",
    "however , it should be noticed that a complete description of the light - matter interaction should always incorporate the counter - rotating terms , especially considering the fact that recent experiments of circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) have accessed the ultrastrong coupling regime ( i.e. , the atom - photon coupling strength has the same order of the photon frequency ) @xcite , in which the rotating - wave approximation totally breaks down .",
    "in such a case , a proper description of the system dynamics should resort to a rabi - lattice model . since the counter - rotating terms in the rabi - lattice model breaks the conservation of excitation number",
    ", there is , in principle , no similar mi as that of the bose - hubbard model and the transition between the sf and mi should be replaced by the coherent and incoherent type @xcite .",
    "these essential changes of equilibrium properties motivate us to ask a question : could the mott - lobe structure still exist even though all of the counter - rotating terms of the atom - photon coupling are taken into consideration ?    in the present paper ,",
    "we try to answer this question by constructing a new type of cavity array , in each cavity of which multiple two - level atoms interact with two independent photon modes .",

    "we also show that the tmdl model can be mapped into a continuous @xmath2 spin model under proper parameter conditions .",
    "finally , motivated by recent experimental achievements of cavity array @xcite and multimode cavity mm11,nms15,dcm15 in circuit qed , we propose a scheme to realize the tmdl model in a two - mode superconducting stripline cavity array .",
    "this work broadens our understanding of strongly - correlated photons .",
    "we study a photon lattice system composed by an array of identical coupled cavities , inside each of which multiple two - level atoms interact with two degenerate photon modes .",

    "the emergence of the so - called counter - rotating terms in the dicke hamiltonian ( [ stand ] ) reduces the conservation of its excitation number , @xmath24 @xmath25 , to a parity @xmath26 .",

    "since the knowledge of the single - site limit is crucial for a further understanding of many - body physics , before proceeding , we first catch some instructive insights into the hamiltonian ( [ tdh ] ) . in the absence of the photon hopping ( @xmath32 ) , the excitation density @xmath29 commutes with the hamiltonian",

    "however , as shown in the hamiltonian ( [ hmf ] ) , if both @xmath46 and @xmath47 vanish , the system dynamics is dominated by the single - site hamiltonian ( [ tdh ] ) , and the photons at each site are thus effectively frozen and characterized by a specific excitation number @xmath35 .",

    "<S> in this paper we construct a new type of cavity array , in each cavity of which multiple two - level atoms interact with two independent photon modes . </S>",
    "<S> this system can be totally governed by a two - mode dicke - lattice model , which includes all of the counter - rotating terms and therefore works well in the ultrastrong coupling regime achieved in recent experiments . attributed to its special atom - photon coupling scheme , this model supports a global conserved excitation and a continuous @xmath0 symmetry , rather than the discrete @xmath1 symmetry in the standard dicke - lattice model . </S>",
    "<S> this distinct change of symmetry via adding an extra photon mode strongly impacts the nature of photon localization / delocalization behavior . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the atom - photon interaction features stable mott - lobe structures of photons and a second - order superfluid - mott - insulator phase transition , which share similarities with the jaynes - cummings - lattice and bose - hubbard models . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , the mott - lobe structures predicted here depend crucially on the atom number of each site . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that our model can be mapped into a continuous @xmath2 spin model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose a scheme to implement the introduced cavity array in circuit quantum electrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this work broadens our understanding of strongly - correlated photons . </S>"
