    "the eight - port homodyne detection scheme has been investigated extensively ever since it was introduced in the realm of quantum optics .",
    "the significance of this scheme comes from the fact that it provides a means to study many fundamental questions in quantum mechanics . among these",
    "are the problems of quantum state reconstruction and approximate joint measurements of quadrature observables .",
    "the usefulness of this setup is due to the fact that it provides a quantum optical realization of the measurement of any covariant phase space observable @xcite . with regard to the aforementioned problems ,",
    "these observables are of great importance . on one hand , since the work of @xcite , a large class of covariant phase space observables are known to possess the property that the measurement outcome statistics determine the state uniquely . on the other hand , the quadrature observables are approximately jointly measurable exactly when there exists a covariant phase space observable which is their approximate joint observable @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to investigate the detailed structure of the observable measured with this specific scheme .",
    "since any realistic measurement involves detectors with non - unit quantum efficiencies , it is important to study also the effects of detector inefficiencies in detail . as reported in the recent review on single - photon detectors @xcite , the efficiencies of available detectors range from very high to as low as a few percents .",
    "it is therefore clear that in most cases the effect of inefficiencies is far from being negligible . in the eight - port homodyne detection scheme ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that with the specific choice of a vacuum parameter field and an overall quantum efficiency for the detectors , the measured probability distribution is a smoothed version of the @xmath0-function of the signal field .",
    "the smoothing is caused by a gaussian convolution which is due to the precence of the non - unit quantum efficiencies .",
    "up to our knowledge , this analysis has not yet been done in the case of an arbitrary parameter field , or with different quantum efficiencies for each of the detectors .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a mathematically rigorous derivation of the high - amplitude limit observable measured with an inefficient eight - port homodyne detector .",
    "the derivation is done strictly within the framework of quantum mechanics without any classicality assumptions .",
    "the result is that whenever detector inefficiencies are present , the measured observable is a smearing of the ideal one .",
    "furthermore , we study some basic properties of the measured observable . in particular , we find that the state distinguishing power does not depend on the associated quantum efficiencies .",
    "more specifically , we show that the measurement statistics of the ideal observable can always be reconstructed from the smeared statistics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by giving the basic framework for our study in section [ preli ] . in section [ measurement ]",
    "we derive the high - amplitude limit observable .",
    "first , we consider the high - amplitude limit in an inefficient balanced homodyne detector , and then use the results to obtain the measured observable in an inefficient eight - port homodyne detector in the high - amplitude limit .",

    "furthermore , several reconstruction formulae for calculating the matrix elements of @xmath41 with respect to the number basis are also known .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in the case of inefficient detectors we may always apply the method of proposition [ info ] to first reconstruct the @xmath0-function from the measurement statistics and then proceed to determine the state of the signal field .",
    "we have considered the eight - port homodyne detection scheme in the case that each of the associated photon detectors is assigned with a different quantum efficiency .",
    "we have shown that in the high - amplitude limit , the measured observable approaches a covariant phase space observable which is a smearing of the one obtained by using ideal detectors .",
    "we have also studied some properties of the high - amplitude limit observable . in particular , we have shown that the state distinguishing power of the observable does not depend on the quantum efficiencies of the detectors .",
    "futhermore , we have seen that when detector inefficiencies are present , the measured observable is never extremal .",
    "that is , the measurement is never a pure quantum measurement .    to conclude",
    ", we wish to emphasize that the quantum efficiency is only one of the properties which characterize a photon detector .",
    "in fact , there is a wide variery of features , ranging from operating temperatures to dark count rates , which are used to classify the detectors @xcite .",
    "thus , in the case of a specific measurement one needs to decide which properties are the ones that need to be optimized .",
    "the consequence of proposition [ info ] is that in eight - port homodyne detection , the quantum efficiencies have no effect on the amount of information obtained about the state of the signal field .",
    "hence , at least for the purpose of quantum state reconstruction , the quantum efficiencies of the available photon detectors are of little relevance , and one may concentrate on the other properties of the detectors .",
