    "it has been known for the past four decades that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , together with the electroweak interactions , underlies all of nuclear physics . soon after the discovery of qcd it became apparent that the complexities of the theory at strong coupling would hinder analytic progress in understanding the properties of the simplest hadrons , let alone the simplest features of the nuclear forces .",
    "wilson pointed the way to eventual direct quantitative confirmation of the origins of nuclear physics by formulating lattice qcd  @xcite , a regularization and non - perturbative definition of qcd that is suitable for the intensive computational demands of solving qcd in the infrared . only in the last five years or",
    "so has lattice qcd emerged from a long period of research and development where only qualitative agreement between calculations and experiments could be claimed to the present , where precise predictions for hadronic quantities are being made .",
    "in particular , presently , fully - dynamical calculations with near - exact chiral symmetry at finite lattice - spacing have become standard , with lattice volumes of spatial extent @xmath0 and with lattice spacings in the range @xmath1 .",
    "it is still the norm that the light - quark masses , @xmath2 , are larger than those of nature , with typical pion masses @xmath3 .",
    "nuclear physics is a vast , rich field , whose phenomenology has been explored for decades through intense experimental and theoretical effort . however , there is still little understanding of the connection to qcd and the basic building blocks of nature , quarks and gluons .",
    "for instance , as a first `` benchmarking '' step , lattice qcd should post - dict the large nucleon - nucleon scattering lengths and the existence of the deuteron , the simplest nucleus .",
    "the connection between qcd and nuclear physics will be firmly established with lattice qcd , and will allow for an exploration of how nuclei and nuclear interactions depend upon the fundamental parameters of nature . in particular , it is believed that an understanding of the fine - tunings that permeate nuclear physics will finally be translated into fine - tunings of the light - quark masses . while these issues are of great interest , and it is important to recover what is known experimentally to high precision , these goals are not the main objective of the lattice qcd effort in nuclear physics .",
    "the primary reason for investing resources in this area is to be able to calculate physical quantities of importance that can not be accessed experimentally , or which can be measured with only limited precision in the laboratory .",
    "two important examples of how lattice qcd calculations can impact nuclear physics are in the structure of nuclei and in the behavior of hadronic matter at densities beyond that of nuclear matter .",
    "lattice qcd will be able to calculate the interactions of multiple nucleons , bound or unbound , in the same way that it can be used to determine the two - body scattering parameters .",
    "for instance , a calculation of the three - neutron interactions will be possible .",
    "extracting hadronic interactions from lattice qcd calculations is more complicated than the determination of the spectrum of stable particles .",
    "this is encapsulated in the maiani - testa theorem  @xcite , which states that s - matrix elements can not be extracted from infinite - volume euclidean - space green functions except at kinematic thresholds .",
    "this is clearly problematic from the nuclear physics perspective , as a main motivation for pursuing lattice qcd is to be able to compute nuclear reactions involving multiple nucleons .",
    "of course , it is clear from the statement of this theorem how it can be evaded , euclidean - space correlation functions are calculated at finite volume to extract s - matrix elements , the formulation of which was known for decades in the context of non - relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite and extended to quantum field theory by lscher  @xcite .",
    "the energy of two particles in a finite volume depends in a calculable way upon their elastic scattering amplitude and their masses for energies below the inelastic threshold .",
    "due to the chiral symmetry of qcd , @xmath4 scattering at low energies is the simplest and best - understood of the hadron - hadron scattering processes .",
    "the scattering lengths for @xmath4 scattering in the s - wave are uniquely predicted at lo in @xmath5-pt  @xcite : @xmath6 and @xmath7 when @xmath8 is set equal to the charged pion mass .",
    "while experiments do not directly provide stringent constraints on the scattering lengths , a determination of s - wave @xmath4 scattering lengths using the roy equations has reached a remarkable level of precision  @xcite : @xmath9 and @xmath10 . at present ,",
    "lattice qcd has computed @xmath4 scattering only in the @xmath11 channel with precision as the @xmath12 channel contains disconnected diagrams .",
    "the only existing @xmath13 lattice qcd prediction of the @xmath14 scattering length involves a mixed - action lattice qcd scheme of domain - wall valence quarks on a rooted staggered sea  @xcite .",
    "the scattering length was computed at pion masses , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and at a single lattice spacing , @xmath19 and lattice size @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the physical value of the scattering length was obtained using two - flavor mixed - action @xmath5-pt which includes the effect of finite lattice - spacing artifacts to @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the final result is : @xmath23 .",
    "lattice qcd calculations at one or more smaller lattice spacings are required to verify and further refine this calculation .",
    "recently , the etm collaboration has performed a @xmath24 calculation of the @xmath14 scattering length at pion masses ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , at two lattice spacings and in two lattice volumes .",
    "the result extrapolated to the physical pion mass is : @xmath27 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : caplots ] ( left panel ) one sees that the @xmath14 scattering length is consistent with the current algebra result up to pion masses that are expected to be at the edge of the chiral regime in the two - flavor sector .",
    "while in the two flavor theory one expects fairly good convergence of the chiral expansion and , moreover , one expects that the effective expansion parameter is small in the channel with maximal isospin , the lattice calculations clearly imply a cancellation between chiral logs and counterterms .",
    "however , as one sees in figure  [ fig : caplots ] ( right panel ) , the same phenomenon occurs in @xmath28 where the chiral expansion is governed by the strange quark mass and is therefore expected to be much more slowly converging .",
    "the @xmath29 scattering length exhibits similar behavior when @xmath30 is plotted against @xmath31 .",
    "this cancellation between chiral logs and counterterms for the meson - meson scattering lengths is quite mysterious .",

    "calculations at this pion mass should be viewed to be only a proof of principle , and in order for lattice calculations to provide meaningful constraints on interactions at the physical pion mass through chiral extrapolation , the pion mass must be substantially reduced down toward the physical value ( @xmath39 ) while maintaining the integrity of the calculation ( i.e. small enough lattice spacings and large enough volumes ) . 0.1 in    @xcite .",
