    "observations in the mid - infrared spectral region ( @xmath9  = 4000 - 400@xmath10 ; @xmath0  = 2.5 - 25@xmath1 ) have led to the identification of various molecules in the icy mantles that coat the dust grains present in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "these include firm identifications of @xmath6 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , ocn@xmath11 ( cyanate ion ) , @xmath7 , @xmath5 , and ocs , some reasonable but more tentative identifications of hcooh ( formic acid ) , hcoo@xmath11 ( formate ion ) , @xmath12  ( formaldehyde ) , and @xmath8 , and the absorption features of some uncharacterized species such as large organics , or molecules possibly related to ammonium ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . observations of spectral features located in the near - infrared spectral region ( @xmath9  = 12500 - 4000@xmath10 ; @xmath0  = 0.8 - 2.5@xmath1 ) have been widely used to identify ices in the outer solar system .",
    "molecules such as @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and n@xmath13 have been identified on planetary bodies such as pluto , charon , triton , and europa ( see a recent review by @xcite and observations by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "cometary nuclei are presumed to have a composition similar to these objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in recent years , observations of the ism have begun to extend into the near - ir spectral region as well .",
    "observations of interstellar material have been made with instruments such as spex on the infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) telescope @xcite and other instruments ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the instruments designed for the future james webb space teleacope ( jwst ) call for an increase in fundamental near - ir data .",
    "the jwst near infrared spectrometer ( nirspec ) will perform observations from 0.6 to 5@xmath1  at spectral resolutions from 100 to 3000 , with the primary objective of studying the processes of star formation in the ism of external galaxies @xcite .",
    "calculations of ice abundances in star - forming regions could be accomplished with near - ir data such as ours .",
    "the relative abundances of ice components can provide key pieces of information about the physical and chemical history of the dense cloud in which the ice species reside .",
    "abundances are obtained by observing the absorption features of a molecule arising from its allowed vibrational modes . for unsaturated features with small peak optical depths , the integrated area of an interstellar ice absorption feature scales with the molecule s abundance by a constant factor .",
    "this factor is called the strength of the absorption feature , and it is an intrinsic physical parameter of its carrier molecule . as has been shown in many previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ir band strengths of most molecules show various degrees of dependence upon environmental factors including ice temperature , overall ice compostion , or the ice s crystalline phase .",
    "the method by which the column densities of interstellar ices are determined from their ir absorption features derives from the beer - lambert law .",
    "the fraction of light transmitted through an interstellar cloud at wavenumber @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 , where the optical depth ( @xmath16 ) may be expressed as the beer - lambert law in the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the column density of the absorbing molecule ( in @xmath19@xmath20 ) , and @xmath21 is the absorption cross - section ( in @xmath19@xmath22 ) at wavenumber @xmath9  ( in @xmath19@xmath10 ) .",
    "since @xmath18 is a constant with respect to @xmath14 , equation  ( [ opticaldepth ] ) can be integrated over wavenumber and re - arranged in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and the integrals in equations  ( [ columndensity ] ) and  ( [ strength ] ) are taken over the range of the studied feature @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 has many names in the literature , including the `` band strength , '' `` integrated cross - section , '' `` absolute absorption intensity , '' or simply `` @xmath27-value '' of the ir absorption feature @xmath25 . as expressed above and as is customary in the astrophysical literature , band strengths possess units of @xmath19@xmath28 , although the physical chemistry literature prefers units such as km  mmol@xmath29 .",
    "the ir absorption features of most molecules of astrophysical interest have band strengths in the range from about @xmath30 to @xmath31@xmath28  ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "mid - ir absorption features of molecules are the result of their fundamental vibrational modes , combinations of the fundamental modes , and their lowest - lying overtones .",
    "near - ir absorptions are generally not due to fundamental vibrations but to higher overtones or combinations of fundamentals and their overtones . as a result ,",
    "the near - ir features of a certain molecule are usually much weaker than those in the mid - ir .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ wholespectra ] , where the combined near- and mid - ir spectra of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8are shown .",
    "note that in each case , the near - ir portion of the spectrum ( @xmath9  = 10000 - 4000@xmath10 ; @xmath0  = 1.0 - 2.5@xmath1 ) has been magnified significantly  from 5 to 100 times  in order to display the near- and mid - ir features on similar scales .",
    "laboratory and observational studies typically use the much stronger mid - ir absorption features to make identifications of molecules in astrophysical ices , due to the fact that they are more sensitive tracers of molecular abundances . however , the mid - ir is not always the best spectral region in which to make astronomical observations .",
    "this is the case for reflectance studies within the solar system , since the solar spectrum peaks in the visible range and the sun emits a much higher flux of near - ir photons than mid - ir photons .    in our laboratory",
    ", we have the ability to study the composite near - ir and mid - ir spectrum , from  10000 to  400@xmath10  ( 1.0 to  25@xmath1 ) , of our ice samples .",
    "this allows us to obtain spectra of the same ice sample in both the near- and mid - ir ranges almost simultaneously , and thus spectral characteristics in both regions may be studied for any material of interest .",
    "on - going work from our laboratory @xcite has been focused on measuring the near - ir spectra of thick ( @xmath3250@xmath1 ) ices that have been highly processed by uv photons .    in this study",
    ", we present the near - ir band strengths of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5  are confirmed components of interstellar icy grain mantles , with @xmath6  dominating most interstellar ice environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these are also ice species found in many icy planetary bodies , including comets and icy moons such as europa or triton ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "extensive searches for the absorption features of @xmath8  ice in interstellar and planetary environments have been performed , with some varied evidence for their presence ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the carbon suboxide molecule ( @xmath4 ) is of interest to both interstellar and planetary astronomers because it is formed from solid @xmath2  in environments affected by energetic processing such as particle irradiation by cosmic rays or magnetspheric particles , or by ultraviolet photolysis ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the near - ir band strengths of these molecules were obtained in pure ice samples at 10@xmath33  by correlating the growths of the near - ir features with those in the mid ir over the course of long , slow deposits of these materials from the gas phase .",
    "future work ( currently in the preliminary phase ) will include studies of near- and mid - ir reflectance spectra as well as the calculations of ice optical constants in these spectral ranges .",
    "the ice creation methods and the experimental system used in this study are very similar to those in previous studies by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "gases are prepared inside a vacuum manifold and vapor - condensed onto an infrared transmitting substrate ( csi ) mounted in the vacuum chamber ( @xmath34 3@xmath35@xmath36  at room temperature ) .",
    "the substrate is cooled by a closed - cycle helium refrigerator ( air products ) to a temperature of 10@xmath33 .",
    "the temperature of the substrate is continuously monitored by a chromel - au thermocouple and is adjustable by a resistive heater element up to room temperature .",
    "the chamber that houses the substrate is accessible to laboratory instruments through four ports .",
    "two of these ports are have windows composed of kbr , allowing the transmission of the infrared beam of the spectrometer .",
    "one of the ports contains a window composed of mgf@xmath13 to enable ultraviolet photolysis of the ice samples ( this option was not used for the experiments described in this paper ) , while the fourth port has a glass window and is used for visual monitoring .",
    "the sample chamber is positioned within the sample compartment of an ftir spectrometer ( thermomattson infinity gold ) so that the spectrometer s ir beam passes through the kbr windows and csi substrate .",
    "the spectrometer system is capable of automatic switching between the appropriate configurations of sources , detectors , and beam splitters that allow the acquistion of spectra in either the near ir or mid ir without breaking the dry air purge .",
    "this feature allows the measurement of spectra in each of these two spectral regions for the same ice sample in a single experiment .",
    "near - ir spectra were obtained over the range from 10000 to 3500@xmath10  ( @xmath0  = 1.0 to 2.9@xmath1 ) and mid - ir spectra 4500 to 400@xmath10  ( @xmath0  = 2.2 to 25@xmath1 ) .",
    "some overlap between these ranges allows for cross - calibration of common features as well as for the concatenation of spectra .",
    "the spectra of @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4  were obtained with a resolution of 4@xmath10 .",
    "the ir spectra of @xmath5  and @xmath2  were taken at a resolution of 1@xmath10 .",
    "absorbance spectra ( @xmath37 ) were calculated from the transmission data ( @xmath38 ) by using the relationship @xmath39 ( note that @xmath40 .",
    "a bulb containing the gas to be condensed was prepared on a separate vacuum manifold and then connected to the high - vacuum system by a narrow tube through a needle valve , which controlled the gas flow into the high - vacuum system .",
    "the tube is positioned to release the gases just in front of the cold substrate window .",
    "gases were deposited at a rate of about 1 - 5@xmath1hr@xmath29 .",
    "most deposits spanned several days in order to create ices thick enough to display detectable near - ir absorptions .",
    "no significant contamination by background gases in the vacuum system ( dominated by @xmath6 ) was observed , supported by the lack of bulk @xmath6  features in the ir spectra of the non-@xmath6samples .",
    "however some small amounts of @xmath6  may be isolated within the @xmath2  and @xmath3  samples , as indicated by sharp features near 3400 and 1600@xmath10  ( @xmath0  = 2.9 and 6.3@xmath1 ) in the mid - ir spectrum shown in figure  [ wholespectra ] .",
    "as indicated by @xcite , the band strengths of @xmath2  and @xmath3  are not significantly affectd by small relative amounts of @xmath6  in an ice sample .",
    "it is important to note that ice samples created in this manner at 10@xmath33  are expected to be amorphous rather than crystalline .",
    "the amorphous nature of our samples was supported by the ir spectra that were recorded during each sample deposit ( see figure  [ wholespectra ] ) .    the gases used and their purities are as follows : @xmath2  ( matheson , 99.9 ) , @xmath3  ( matheson , 99.8 ) , @xmath4(synthesized ) , @xmath5  ( matheson , 99 + ) , @xmath6  ( distilled by freeze - thaw cycles under vacuum ) , @xmath7  ( distilled by freeze - thaw cycles under vacuum ) , and @xmath8  ( matheson , 99 + ) .",
    "@xmath6  and @xmath7  were purified by freezing with liquid n@xmath13 under vacuum and pumping away the more volatile gases while thawing .",
    "carbon suboxide was prepared as described in detail by @xcite who followed the method of @xcite to dehydrate malonic acid in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide ( p@xmath13o@xmath41 ; a dessicant ) .",
    "to summarize the gases produced by heating malonic acid to 413@xmath33  ( @xmath6 , @xmath3 , acetic acid , and @xmath4 ) were collected in a liquid n@xmath13 trap and the @xmath4was distilled by thermal transfer into a new bulb in the vacuum manifold .",
    "the spectra of pure @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8  were collected in the near - ir region from 10000 - 3500@xmath10  ( 1.0 - 2.9@xmath1 ) and the mid - ir region from 4500 - 400@xmath10(2.2 - 25@xmath1 ) during the slow growth of films at 10@xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ wholespectra ] displays representative concatenated spectra ( 10000 - 400@xmath10 ; 1.0 - 25@xmath1 ) of these ice samples .",
    "the near - ir regions in figure  [ wholespectra ] have been magnified for direct comparison to the mid - ir region .",
    "band strengths were measured by observing the rate of growth of a near - ir feature in relation to that of a stronger feature in the mid - ir , as described below .",
    "the mid - ir features used and their band strengths are listed in table  [ mid - ir ] .",
    "the near - ir features observed in the spectra and their calculated band strengths are listed in table  [ results_table ] .",
    "figures  [ co_plot]-[nh3_plot ] display the selected near - ir regions of the studied spectra and the curves of growth of the near - ir features .",
    "the integrated absorbance of each feature ( in units of @xmath19@xmath10 ) was measured by integrating between baseline points on either side of the feature , assuming a linear shape to the baseline underneath each feature .",
    "the error in the feature areas was estimated by integrating across the same limits when no feature was apparent above the noise level in the infrared spectrum . for narrow features ( @xmath42@xmath9@xmath43 10@xmath10 ) ,",
    "the errors were found to be about 0.005  to 0.01@xmath10 , and larger for wider features ( in direct proportion to the width ) .",
    "for this reason , any areas with measured values below about 0.008@xmath10  were omitted from the fitting procedure ( these points are plotted as open symbols in figures  [ co_plot]-[nh3_plot ] ) .    to determine the relative strengths of two absorption features for a single molecule , we have examined the relationship between the areas of these bands as the ice is grown . in principle",
    ", one could merely measure a single ice spectrum and determine the relative strengths of any two features by taking the ratio of their areas .",
    "however , since the near - ir features are much weaker than those in the mid - ir ( typically , 10 - 100 times smaller ; see figure  [ wholespectra ] ) , errors in their measured areas are relatively much higher . by monitoring the relationship between two given absorption features over the course of a slow deposit ,",
    "the systematic errors involved in measuring the areas of the near - ir features are signifcantly reduced .    for optically thin ice absorptions",
    ", we expect that depositing a certain number of molecules will cause a linear increase the areas of both features , where each increase is proportional to that feature s band strength see equation  [ columndensity ] .",
    "hence , the initial trend in a plot of feature area vs. feature area should be a straight line , whose slope corresponds to the ratio of the band strengths . multiplying this ratio by the known band strength of the mid - ir feature ( table  [ mid - ir ] )",
    ", the near - ir band strength is obtained .",
    "the experimental errors in near - ir band strengths were obtained by multiplying the standard deviations in the best - fitting slopes by the mid - ir band strength .",
    "values resulting from the trends displayed in figures  [ co_plot]-[nh3_plot ] are listed in table  [ results_table ] .    in the cases of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5",
    ", the scaling process was complicated by the fact that the fundamental features are extremely sharp and become saturated very quickly during the deposit . for @xmath2(figure  [ co_plot ] ) , the absorption due to its fundamental vibration at 2137@xmath10  ( 4.679@xmath1 ) becomes too large to be useful after only short deposition times . as a result",
    ", we have used the absorption feature of @xmath44@xmath2  at 2092@xmath10  ( 4.780@xmath1 ) to scale the @xmath45@xmath2  and @xmath44@xmath2  near - ir features .",
    "the strength of 1.5@xmath46  cm  per  @xmath45@xmath2  molecule was used for the 2092@xmath10(4.780@xmath1 ) feature , taking the band strength of the @xmath44@xmath2  feature from @xcite and scaling by the terrestrial ratio of @xmath47c/@xmath48c of 87 . for @xmath3 , the combination mode at 3708@xmath10(2.697@xmath1 )",
    "was used to scale the near - ir features . for @xmath5(figure  [ ch4_plot ] ) , the absorptions due to fundamental modes at 3009 and 1306@xmath10  ( 3.323 and 7.657@xmath1 ) become too strong to be useful after only short timescales as well .",
    "because of this , the near - ir features were scaled by the absorption feature located at 2815@xmath10  ( 3.552@xmath1 ) , which is due to its @xmath49 vibration mode . in order to to this , we first determined the band strength for the 2815@xmath10  ( 3.552@xmath1 ) feature to be @xmath27 = ( 1.9@xmath500.1)@xmath51@xmath28  by scaling it by the @xmath52 fundamental mode at 1306@xmath10  ( @xmath0  = 7.657@xmath1 ; @xmath27 = 7.0@xmath51@xmath28 ; @xcite ) in the spectrum of a thin sample .",
    "the 8405@xmath10  ( 1.190@xmath1 ) feature of @xmath5  displayed a peculiar growth curve , with no discernible linear trend .",
    "hence , no band strength is listed for this feature in table  [ results_table ] .    as observed in figures  [ co_plot]-[nh3_plot ] , the trends are initially linear for the ices we have studied . in some cases ,",
    "the mid - ir feature used for the @xmath53-axis becomes so large that its curve of growth becomes non - linear ( the change in feature area no longer responds linearly to the increase in the number of molecules ) . in these cases ,",
    "the non - linear portions of the data set were omitted from our fitting process ( omitted data points are plotted as open symbols in figures  [ co_plot]-[nh3_plot ] ) .",
    "it may be interesting to note that the non - linear parts of the curve are not always identical from experiment to experiment .",
    "this is especially clear in the two separate deposits of @xmath4  ( fig .",
    "[ c3o2_plot ] ) , @xmath6(fig .",
    "[ h2o_plot ] ) , and @xmath8  ( fig .",
    "[ nh3_plot ] ) .",
    "this may suggest that ice deposition rates or other characteristics of a single experiment can significantly alter the physical properties of the ice under study , especially when ices are thicker than about 10@xmath1 .",
    "this particular issue has been discussed in detail previously by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have published values for some of the same near - ir band strengths of pure @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath7  ices at low temperatures . in general",
    ", we find our values to be in excellent agreement with theirs .",
    "they quote @xmath27 = 1.1@xmath51@xmath28  for the @xmath6  feature near 5000@xmath10  ( 2.0@xmath1 ) , which is in full agreement with our experimentally determined value of @xmath54@xmath51@xmath28 . for @xmath8",
    ", they find a value of @xmath27 = 9.7@xmath46@xmath28  for the band near 4478@xmath10  ( 2.233@xmath1 ) , for which we find @xmath27 = @xmath55@xmath46@xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath7 , they measure @xmath27 = @xmath56@xmath46@xmath28  for the feature near 4395@xmath10  ( 2.275@xmath1 ) , which is also in good agreement with our measured value of @xmath57@xmath46@xmath28  for the 4400@xmath10(2.273@xmath1 ) feature observed here .    @xcite published absorption coefficients ( the fraction of intensity absorbed per unit thickness of the sample ; in @xmath10 ) of the near - ir features of pure @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5  for use in planetary ice studies .",
    "the absorption coefficient allows one to calculate the thickness of a sample from the absorbance value at the peak of a feature .",
    "it is not necessarily straightforward to compare band strengths with absorption coefficients for ice samples prepared in separate laboratories using different techniques , since one must take into account the densities of the samples in order to connect column densities to thicknesses .",
    "ice samples in the @xcite study were created in a closed cell and not by vapor deposit . for the sake of a comparison to our study",
    ", one must make the rather unsafe assumption that the ice densities and spectral profiles of our samples are identical to theirs ( they most likely are not identical ) . in this case , the band strengths of any two features for a given molecule should scale in the same manner as their absorption coefficients .",
    "taking the ratios of band strengths from table  [ results_table ] for pairs of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5  features and comparing them to the ratios of their reported absorption coefficients @xcite , we find that some agree quite well ( to within a few percent ) , but most agree only to within a factor of 2 or so .",
    "@xcite find that the near - ir spectrum of the line of sight toward the high - mass protostar w33a is consistent with the known abundances of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath2  as derived from mid - ir data .",
    "they claim the detection of the near - ir features of @xmath7near 4400@xmath10  ( 2.273@xmath1 ) with an optical depth of about 0.014 .    based on our laboratory data",
    ", one should be able to predict the optical depths of near - ir ice absorptions that could be investigated in various astrophysical objects . using the widths and strengths for the two strongest near - ir features of our samples",
    ", we have estimated the their optical depths for some well - studied lines of sight in the ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these estimates are listed in table  [ optical_depths ] .",
    "although pure ices at 10@xmath33  may not reflect the most realistic cases for these objects , previous work @xcite does suggest that the band strengths of most molecules studied to date do not vary by more than a factor of 2 or so according to composition or to temperature .",
    "it should be noted that the strengths of a certain molecule s absorption features do vary by large amounts when different crystalline states are considered , but interstellar ices are presumed to be amorphous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the near - ir band strengths ( or `` absorption intensities '' ) for molecules of interest to both interstellar and planetary astronomers may be determined through correlations to their better - known mid - ir characteristics . by correlating the growth of near - ir and mid - ir absorption features for molecules at low temperature",
    ", we have calculated the absorption strengths for the near - ir features of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "these strengths may be used to determine the column densities of these molecules in the interstellar dense cloud or other environments from observed transmission data .",
    "this is the first paper in a series of near- and mid - ir correlation studies of ice samples of astrophysical interest .",
    "future work currently in preparation in our laboratory will involve the calculation of ice optical constants for use in particle scattering models as well as reflectance studies for use in the direct interpretation of planetary observations of reflected sunlight .",
