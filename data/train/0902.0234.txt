    "the quantum wave nature of matter has become a corner stone of physics over many decades , and current interest in de broglie interferometry with electrons  @xcite , neutrons  @xcite , atoms  @xcite , and molecules  @xcite ranges from demonstrating fundamental quantum phenomena to advanced applications in the materials sciences and in quantum metrology .",
    "all these experiments require optical elements for the coherent manipulation of matter waves . while clean solid surfaces and bulk crystal structures are well - adapted to the diffraction of electrons and neutrons with de broglie wavelengths in the range of 1 .. 1000pm , it is often necessary to tailor the beam splitters , lenses , and wave guides to the specific particle properties in atomic and molecular applications .    for complex molecules ,",
    "nanofabricated gratings were demonstrated to act as beam splitters for far - field diffraction  @xcite and near - field interferometry  @xcite . however , these experiments pointed already to the importance of van der waals interactions between the molecules and the diffraction grating , which largely exceeds the effect observed with atoms  @xcite because of the high molecular polarizability and their comparatively low velocity .",
    "the interaction time with a 500 nm thick grating amounts to only 5ns at a beam velocity of 100 m/s , and yet the matter wave phase shift can attain the value of several radians in the center of the slit opening .",
    "the interaction effect gets even stronger close to the slit walls , to a degree that the wave front distortion can no longer be described by a phase shift alone  @xcite . for particles with",
    "increasing polarizability this strong influence of the grating interaction leads to prohibitive requirements on the velocity , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore appealing to replace material gratings by structures made of light , which offer the additional advantage of being indestructible , highly transparent , and easy to tune and modulate .",
    "bragg diffraction of _ free electrons _ at a standing light field was already proposed by kapitza and dirac in 1933  @xcite , but nearly seventy years passed before the idea was experimentally implemented  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that , the first optical phase grating for atoms was already realized in 1983  @xcite when a standing laser light field was tuned near to an atomic resonance in order to perform raman - nath ( ` thin grating ' ) diffraction of a supersonic sodium beam . a related investigation  @xcite then focused on _ atomic diffraction _ in the bragg regime ( ` thick grating ' ) .",
    "these ideas were later extended to atom diffraction  @xcite and interferometry  @xcite , also to the time domain  @xcite , and to the manipulation of _ bose - einstein _",
    "condensates  @xcite .",
    "the working principle of all phase grating examples is the same : a coherent laser beam creates a periodic pattern of the electrical field .",
    "this couples to the particle s polarizability , shifts the energy and thus imprints a phase pattern on the transmitted matter wave beam . its evolution into a modulated particle density distribution can then be observed further downstream .",
    "large , hot molecules in thermal beams often exhibit broad absorption lines .",
    "light will therefore mainly couple in a non - resonant fashion .",
    "however , for most molecules one can still find a suitable range of wavelengths where the light - molecule coupling allows one to imprint a local matter wave phase shift of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the first application of optical phase gratings to _ large , hot molecules _ was demonstrated with c@xmath0 in a far - field diffraction experiment  @xcite . the combination with near - field diffraction",
    "was suggested in  @xcite and recently implemented in a kapitza - dirac - talbot - lau interferometer ( kdtli )  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the general idea behind the kdtli design has been described elsewhere  @xcite : a first absorptive mechanical structure , g1 , ( in the present experiment @xmath5 nm ) prepares the required spatial coherence for illuminating the optical phase grating , g2 .",
    "quantum interference then explains the appearance of an approximate self - image of g2 at the position of the third mask g3 .",
    "this molecular density pattern is scanned by shifting g3 across the beam while counting the transmitted molecules as a function of the mask position .",
    "this scheme was exploited to perform quantum interference experiments up to extended polyatomic molecular chains  @xcite and to determine electrical molecular properties  @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we now provide a refined theoretical description of kapitza - dirac - talbot - lau interference , putting special emphasis on the proper incorporation of the influence of photon absorption in the second grating .",
    "we give a closed expression for both the quantum interference visibility and the fringe contrast one would expect if a classical moir description were correct .",
    "we then compare this to the measured interference curves of c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 which are in nearly perfect agreement with the quantum result .",
    "we also apply the kdtl concept to studying the fluorofullerenes c@xmath0f@xmath2 and c@xmath0f@xmath3 .",
    "this allows us to assess the influence of mass , absorption cross section , and optical polarizability on the interference of large particles . in comparison to earlier talbot - lau experiments",
    "@xcite , the new kapitza - dirac - talbot - lau interferometer now also allows us to establish a significantly improved fringe contrast .",
    "the kapitza - dirac - talbot - lau interferometer is a derivative of the standard talbot - lau interferometer  @xcite , obtained by substituting the central grating mask with the optical phase grating created by a standing laser beam . in the simplest configuration all gratings , material and optical , have the same grating period @xmath6 , given by one half of the laser wavelength , @xmath7 .",
    "the passage of the matter wave beam through each grating may thus transfer integer multiples of the grating momentum @xmath8 to the transverse motion in the beam .",
    "these different diffraction orders interfere further downstream , leading to a resonant enhancement at integer multiples of the talbot length @xmath9 , which is determined by the de broglie wave length @xmath10 of the molecules ( which ranges between 1 pm and 5 pm in our experiment ) .",
    "the emerging interference pattern at the position of the third grating thus displays a strong dependence of the interference fringe visibility on @xmath11 , as determined by the longitudinal velocity @xmath12 of the beam .    unlike with material gratings",
    ", in the kdtli we must also consider the possibility that one or more laser photons are scattered or absorbed while the molecule traverses the standing light wave .",
    "the associated incoherent transfer of transverse momentum may strongly blur the fringe pattern .",
    "if the absorption is followed by an immediate isotropic reemission process , the transverse momentum shift may take any value up to the photon momentum @xmath13 .",
    "however , in many large molecules the absorbed photon energy gets stored for a rather long time , either in metastable excited states or , after rapid internal conversion , in the vibrational degrees of freedom , which do not decay over the time scale of the experiment .",
    "the associated transverse momentum transfer is then an integer multiple of the photon momentum @xmath13 , corresponding to one half of the grating momentum @xmath14 .",
    "an odd number of net photon momenta will thus kick the molecular wave such that the fringes get blurred maximally , while an even number will have a much weaker effect .",
    "we note that related physics has already been described in the context of far - field diffraction  @xcite and mach - zehnder interferometry  @xcite with atoms before .    in order to describe the interplay of coherent diffraction and the incoherent effect of photon absorption we follow the phase space formulation of talbot - lau interference based on the wigner function , as presented in @xcite .",
    "it provides a transparent representation of all relevant coherent and incoherent phenomena , and it permits us to calculate the quantum interference pattern on an equal footing with the possible moir - type structures , which might arise already due to classical mechanics in this setup .",
    "this comparison with the classical description is required if one wants to establish that the observed fringe pattern in a molecule interference experiment is caused by a genuine quantum interference effect .",
    "we start by collecting the necessary ingredients for describing the effects of a light grating on the motion of a beam of polarizable particles . taking the direction of the particle beam as the @xmath15-axis",
    ", we set the retro - reflected , basic gaussian laser mode in the perpendicular @xmath16-direction .",
    "the time averaged intensity of the standing light wave is then given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the laser beam waists in the vertical and the longitudinal direction , and @xmath20 is the laser power . in the following ,",
    "we assume the particle beam height to be sufficiently small compared to @xmath18 , such that the dependence on the vertical @xmath21-direction can be safely neglected .",
    "this is approximately the case in our experiment , see below .",
    "the standing light field will in general induce dispersive and absorptive forces on a molecule .",
    "the first type , due to the conservative optical dipole force , is described by the potential @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the real part of the polarizability of the particle at the laser frequency @xmath24 ( related to the polarizability in si units by @xmath25 ) .    treating the effect of the grating potential in the eikonal approximation , a traversing quantum wave acquires a position dependent phase shift which is calculated by integrating the potential along a straight line ,    @xmath26    the maximal shift @xmath27 thus increases linearly with the optical polarizability and laser power , and it is inversely proportional to the molecule velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the justification of this eikonal approximation and its range of applicability are discussed in some detail in @xcite . as shown there ,",
    "it is well justified for the molecular masses and polarizabilities accessible with the current experimental setup .",
    "the second type of momentum exchange between the light and the molecules is the radiation pressure force due to photon absorption .",
    "the molecules used in the present experiment are sufficiently large and internally complex that it is justified to both ignore any reemission and to take the absorption cross section constant even after the absorption of several photons . in this case",
    "all absorption events can be described as being independent and as only determined by the absorption cross section @xmath28 at the laser frequency @xmath29 .",
    "this cross section can often be related to the imaginary part of the polarizability using mie theory , @xmath30 , but we will treat @xmath28 as an independent parameter in the following .",
    "the photon absorption rate is determined by the incident photon flux @xmath31 and @xmath28 , @xmath32 below , the radiation pressure effect on the molecular beam will be described by the position dependent mean number of absorbed photons .",
    "the latter is obtained from the photon absorption rate , in analogy to the eikonal approximation , by a straight integration along the longitudinal motion of the molecule ,    @xmath33    the maximum mean number of absorbed photons @xmath34 is found in the anti - nodes of the standing light wave , and it is given by @xmath35 the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 defined in ( [ eq : phi0def ] ) and ( [ eq : n0def ] ) are the two key parameters describing the molecule - light interaction , and they will appear in the closed formula for the quantum interference visibility below .",
    "we note that the momentum - changing effect of photon absorptions does not differ in the quantum and the classical description of the molecular motion . on the other hand ,",
    "the classical effect of the optical dipole force due to the potential ( [ eq : voptdip ] ) should be treated in analogy to the eikonal approximation of the quantum case .",
    "this is done in terms of the momentum kick @xmath38 obtained by integrating the dipole force along the same straight line as in the eikonal treatment @xcite , @xmath39 with @xmath36 from ( [ eq : phi0def ] ) .",
    "( the @xmath40 in the prefactor cancels planck s constant in @xmath36 rendering the equation classical . )    as we will see below , the spatially periodic focusing of classical particles due to the dipole potential may result in a regular molecule pattern behind the light grating , though distinctly different from the quantum prediction . to perform the quantum and the classical calculations it is useful to formulate the effect of the grating passage in a common framework , the wigner - weyl phase space representation .",
    "the most important part in describing the kdtl - interference is the transformation of the particle beam state as it passes the second grating .",
    "we consider the wigner function @xmath41 of the transverse quantum state of motion @xmath42 of the molecular beam @xcite , where @xmath16 and @xmath43 denote the position and momentum coordinates in phase space , and we first assume the longitudinal velocity of the molecules to be given by a definite value @xmath12 .    after passing an arbitrary grating in eikonal approximation",
    ", the transformed beam state can always be written as @xcite @xmath44 that is , the momentum dependence of the quasi phase space distribution gets modified by a convolution , while its position dependence is at most affected by a multiplication .",
    "let us now discuss the grating transformation for an arbitrary , @xmath6-periodic distribution of the light intensity .",
    "we first assume that there is no absorption , @xmath45 , so that the grating transformation is entirely coherent .",
    "the phase shift @xmath46 then relates the wave function @xmath47 in front of the grating to the one behind , @xmath48 . in phase space representation",

    ", we now consider the grating transformation for a vanishing dipole force , @xmath54 , but maintain a finite absorption cross section .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the final detection efficiency of the beam particles is practically independent of the number of absorbed photons . in this case ,",
    "their motional state gets effectively replaced by a statistical mixture whose components differ by momentum translations of integer multiples of the photon momentum @xmath55 .",
    "these multiples correspond to the difference in the number of photons absorbed from the left and from the right side .",
    "we denote as @xmath56 the position - dependent probability distribution for the exchange of @xmath57 net photon momenta .",
    "the mixture can then be written in phase space representation as @xmath58 .",
    "that is , the statistical redistribution of the momenta due to photon absorption is described by the incoherent kernel @xmath59 expanding the periodic position dependence of @xmath60 in a fourier series , @xmath61 it takes the form @xmath62 let us now specify the probability distribution ( [ eq : probdef ] ) in terms of the mean number of absorbed photons @xmath63 .",

    "the remarkably small statistical errors indicate that our method offers the capacity for high precision metrology experiments with heavy molecules .",
    "the accuracy is , however , currently limited by the systematic errors which are primarily governed by the accuracy of the measurement of the power ( @xmath171 ) and the waist ( @xmath172 ) of the diffracting laser beam .    the decrease in polarizability from c@xmath0",
    "to c@xmath0f@xmath3 is in good accordance with the observation that fluorinated molecules in general show a reduced polarizability - to - mass ratio and correspondingly lower inter - molecular binding , lower sublimation enthalpies and higher vapor pressures at a given temperature  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to see that the fluorine shell reduces the absorption cross section at the wavelength of the diffracting laser beam to a negligible value .",
    "our measurement thus allows us to extract information about the effect of fluorination on the electronic properties of fullerenes .",
    "matter wave interferometry with large molecules operates with de broglie wavelengths in the range of a few picometers and grating periods as small as a few hundred nanometers . as a result of that , the interferometer alignment has to be considered carefully .",
    "the following section is therefore devoted to a short assessment of the constraints on the experimental precision .",
    "if the first two gratings have only slightly different lattice periods , the interference pattern spacing will not match the period of the third mask and the contrast will be reduced .",
    "a period mismatch as small as one per mille leads already to half a fringe shift between slit one and five hundred .    in practice ,",
    "all grating periods must be , on average , equal to better than 0.05 nm , i.e about the diameter of a hydrogen atom .",
    "this condition enters both the choice of the grating manufacturing process and the alignment of the yaw angle for all gratings .",
    "modern photo - lithography and etching procedures allow to reach this level of precision .",
    "the gratings for our experiments were produced by dr .",
    "tim savas at mit and ` nm@xmath173 ' inc , cambdridge , massachusetts , and independently checked by ibsen photonics , denmark .",
    "the gratings were fabricated to be 0.3 nm wider than the period of the standing light wave in order to allow for later yaw adjustments .",
    "the lateral position @xmath174 of all gratings relative to each other determines the final location of the fringe pattern . for talbot - lau interferometry",
    "we can define a phase of the near - sinusoidal interferogram which is determined by the relative shift of the molecular density maxima with regard to the openings of the third grating . for geometrical reasons",
    "this phase is determined by ( e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath175 with @xmath176 . in a symmetrical setup such as ours , with @xmath177 , the prefactor of the first and third grating must be equal while the second grating s shift enters twice .     while the third one is restricted to @xmath178 .",
    "the distance between the source and @xmath179 is @xmath180 while the spacing between @xmath181 and the detector is @xmath182 .",
    "the grating separation amounts to @xmath183 .",
    "the beam width of about 1 mm is sufficient to illuminate nearly 4000 grating openings.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    molecules passing the gratings at different heights @xmath184 will effectively see different transverse grating shifts @xmath185 if element @xmath186 is rolled by the angle @xmath187 . although a simple phase shift will not reduce the fringe visibility , an integration over many height - dependent shifts does .",
    "if we neglect gravity , we can assume the second grating to define the reference angle , @xmath188 , and study the influence of rolling g@xmath165 by @xmath189 and g@xmath164 around @xmath190 .",
    "in the paraxial limit the total signal @xmath191 behind the third grating is then @xmath192 where the transmission function @xmath193 is parametrized as a sine wave with visibility @xmath194 and height dependent phase shifts @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "we denote @xmath197 , @xmath198 with @xmath199 and all distances as shown in figure  [ rollpitchyaw ] .    from eq .",
    "( [ sumroll ] ) we see that rolling g@xmath165 and g@xmath164 reduces the fringe visibility in a sinc - shaped functional dependence .",
    "the alignment becomes increasingly important for smaller grating constants and more extended molecular beams . in our experiment ,",
    "the first zero of the sinc - curve appears for a roll angle of around 0.65  mrad .",
    "in addition to shifting the phase , rolling also affects the effective grating constant . if one of the gratings is rolled with respect to the others its projected period increases by @xmath200 ( see fig .",
    "[ rollpitchyaw ] ) .",
    "if we require the relative period change not to exceed @xmath201 , the roll angle has to be kept aligned to within 10mrad .      the semiclassical picture in fig .",
    "[ rollpitchyaw]a shows that the interference pattern is also blurred when the third mask is moved relative to the second grating by the distance @xmath202 . for symmetry reasons ,",
    "the same is true for a movement of g1 .",
    "the contrast is severely reduced when the blur @xmath203 is as wide as half a grating period .",
    "we see that this condition is met when @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the number of grating slits illuminated by the molecular beam .",
    "we thus derive the _ length - balance criterion _",
    "@xmath206 when 4000 lines are illuminated , as in our experiments , we have to balance the distances to better than 25@xmath156 m .",
    "this is already comparable to the waist of the diffracting laser beam .",
    "this intuitive condition is consistent with a complementary and more rigorous treatment using wigner functions  @xcite .",
    "the effect of forward or backward tilting a single grating , i.e. to add a _ pitch _ , is to introduce a height - dependent imbalance in the grating separation .",
    "the pitch must be compatible with the requirement of eq .",
    "( [ langenbedingung ] ) .",
    "if the beam height is @xmath207 and the forward pitch is measured by the angle @xmath208 then the arm lengths are balanced as long as @xmath209 . for our experiment with @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 , this corresponds to 250mrad . this condition can easily be met .",
    "to first order , the argument for grating pitch also holds for grating yaw .",
    "however , yaw also changes the slit s effective period as well as their effective open width . under a yaw of angle @xmath213 the grating constant shrinks like @xmath214 .",
    "similarly to the roll - related period change we derive the condition @xmath215mrad .",
    "finally , we have to include the effective reduction of the open slit width if the grating is turned : the openings shrink because of the finite wall thickness @xmath216 to @xmath217 . a reduction of the open fraction in the first or third grating is important as it tends to increase the fringe visibility while decreasing the count rate at the same time .",
    "a variation by 10% in visibility is already rather clearly noticeable , leading to the constraint : @xmath218 . for @xmath219 nm and @xmath220 nm",
    "we thus find a limit of @xmath221mrad for the maximally allowed yaw angle in our experiments .",
    "for the second grating a different reasoning applies : the optical grating is about 20@xmath156 m thick along the direction of the molecular beam , therefore we have to make sure that no molecule crosses a sizeable fraction of the standing light wave period transversely .",
    "since the period is as small as 266 nm the condition imposes a limit on both the angle of incidence and the divergence angle of the molecular beam : @xmath222mrad .",
    "our experiment combines the virtues of near field interferometry with the advantages of optical manipulation . compared to far - field diffraction of collimated beams ,",
    "near - field interferometry provides higher signal throughput at the expense of increased alignment requirements . as discussed in this paper ,",
    "the experimental challenges are non - negligible but manageable with reasonable effort .",
    "optical phase gratings allow us to operate with highly polarizable molecules , which would otherwise acquire prohibitively large van der waals phases by interacting with the walls of material gratings .",
    "the kapitza - dirac - talbot - lau interferometer is very well described using a wigner function approach , which facilitates in particular the inclusion of grating transformations and momentum exchange in the interferometer .",
    "the model is in excellent accordance with the experiments , even for particles as complex as c@xmath0f@xmath2 and c@xmath0f@xmath3 .",
    "actually the kdtli allowed us to observe much improved contrast compared to earlier pure talbot lau experiments with the same particles  @xcite .",
    "this instrument and its theoretical description are now a good basis to continue the quest for the ultimate mass and complexity limits of matter - wave interferometry .",
    "in addition , it has proven to be useful for a number of relevant measurements of molecular properties , such as optical polarizabilities and absolute optical absorption cross sections   @xcite .",
    "interestingly the rich internal structure of complex molecules , including electric dipole moments or magnetic moments , structural properties etc . can be ignored unless they either modify the optical polarizability or unless we introduce additional field gradients or collisions  @xcite which allow to couple to these properties separately  @xcite .",
