    "the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of dilute gases in 1995 @xcite marked the beginning of a new era in atomic , molecular and optical ( amo ) physics and quantum optics .",
    "in fact , the phenomenon known as bec was predicted by einstein in 1924 @xcite based on the ideas of bose @xcite concerning photons : in a system of bosons obeying bose statistics under the assumption that it is in equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1 , einstein @xcite derived the so - called bose - einstein distribution ( or bose - einstein statistics ) , in the grand canonical ensemble , for the mean occupation of the @xmath2th energy state as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy of the @xmath2th state , @xmath5 is the number of particles in state @xmath2 , @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the mean total number of particles is given as @xmath7 , and the mean total energy is given as @xmath8 . from the above distribution , einstein @xcite predicted that there should be a critical temperature @xmath9 below which a finite fraction of all the particles `` condense '' into the same one - particle state .",
    "einstein s original prediction was for a noninteracting gas and did not receive much attention in a long time .",
    "after the observation of superfluidity in liquid @xmath10he below the @xmath11 temperature ( @xmath12k ) in 1938 , london @xcite suggested that despite the strong interatomic interactions bec was indeed occurring in this system and was responsible for the superfluid properties .",
    "this suggestion has stood the test of time and is the basis for our modern understanding of the properties of the superfluid phase . by combining laser cooling and evaporative cooling , in 1995 bec",
    "was realized in a system that is about as different as possible from @xmath10he , namely , dilute atomic alkali gases trapped by magnetic fields and over the last two decades these systems have been the subject of an explosion of research , both experimental and theoretical . perhaps the single aspect of bec systems that makes them most fascinating is best illustrated by the cover of _ science _ magazine of december 22 , 1995 , in which the bose condensate is declared `` * molecule of the year * '' and pictured as a platoon of soldiers marching in lock - step : every atom in the condensate must behave in exactly the same way , and this has the consequence , _ inter alia _ , that effects which are so small as to be essentially invisible at the level of single atom may be spectacularly amplified .",
    "most bec experiments reach quantum degeneracy between @xmath13 nk and @xmath14 @xmath1k , at densities between @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the largest condensates are of @xmath18 million atoms for sodium , and a billion for hydrogen ; the smallest are just a few hundred atoms . depending on the magnetic trap ,",
    "the shape of the condensate is either approximately round , with a diameter of @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath1 m , or cigar - shaped with about @xmath20 @xmath1 m in diameter and @xmath21 @xmath1 m in length .",
    "the full cooling cycle that produce a condensate may take from a few seconds to as long as several minutes @xcite . for better understanding of the long history towards the bec and its physical study , we refer to the nobel lectures @xcite and several review papers in physics @xcite .    the experimental advances in bec @xcite have spurred great excitement in the amo community and condense matter community as well as computational and applied mathematics community .",
    "since 1995 , numerous efforts have been devoted to the studies of ultracold atomic gases and various kinds of condensates of dilute gases have been produced for both bosonic particles and fermionic particles @xcite . in this rapidly growing research area ,",
    "mathematical models and analysis as well as numerical simulation have been playing an important role in understanding the theoretical part of bec and predicting and guiding the experiments .",
    "the goal of this paper is to offer a short survey on mathematical models and theories as well as numerical methods for bec based on the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the gpe for bec based on the mean field approximation .",
    "ground states and their computations are discussed in section 3 , and dynamics and its computation are presented in section 4 .",
    "extensions to rotating bec , dipolar bec and spin - orbit - coupled bec are presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , some conclusions and perspectives are drawn in section 6 .",
