    "an edge from @xmath5 to @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 , and we say that @xmath6 is a ( directed ) neighbour of @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the graph @xmath2 is simple , that is , for any @xmath8 there is at most one edge from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "this simplicity assumption can easily be dropped .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the graph is locally finite , in the sense that both the in - degree and out - degree of every vertex are finite .    in a standard @xmath0 epidemic ,",
    "a vertex is identified with an individual which makes ( asymmetric ) contacts with each of its neighbours at rate @xmath9 .",
    "if an infectious individual @xmath5 contacts a susceptible individual @xmath6 , then @xmath6 becomes infectious itself . if an individual becomes infectious it will stay infectious for a random time ; the infectious periods of different individuals are i.i.d .",
    "after the infectious period an individual is removed , which can either mean that it is recovered or that the individual has died .",
    "a removed individual never becomes susceptible or infectious again .",
    "usually , one assumes that there is one initially infectious individual @xmath10 , and that all other individuals in the network are initially susceptible .",
    "furthermore , one assumes that demography plays no role , in the sense that we ignore births , deaths not caused by the infectious disease and migration .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption if we consider emerging infectious diseases for which the time - scale of the spread is much smaller than the time - scale of demography .    in the model",
    "just described , one implicitly assumes that all individuals in the network are the same ( at least with respect to the epidemic ) apart from their position in the network .",
    "in particular all individuals will have the same total infectivity and susceptibility .",
    "in real - life however , infectivity and susceptibility show individual variation , notably because of immunological polymorphism , or due to polymorphic reactions to vaccination @xcite .",
    "the infectivity and susceptibility of one individual are in general not independent .",
    "dependencies may arise because of confounding factors , such as age , general health status or in case of sexually transmitted diseases , promiscuity and levels of condom use , which affect the susceptibility and infectivity in the same direction .    in this paper , we model heterogeneity of the population by assigning a random infectivity @xmath11 and susceptibility @xmath12 to each vertex @xmath6 in @xmath3 , where the vectors @xmath13 are assumed to be i.i.d .  and distributed as @xmath14 , taking values in a convex subset @xmath15 of @xmath16 .",
    "we do not assume that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are independent .",
    "conditionally on the weights , if @xmath5 becomes infected and @xmath17 , then @xmath6 becomes infected ( if it was not already ) with probability @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is some connection function , specified in the model .",
    "in percolation terms , this means that the directed edge @xmath7 is open with ( conditional ) probability @xmath20 ; conditioned on the weights , the states of the edges are independent .",
    "however , without this conditioning states of edges sharing an end - vertex are dependent through the weights assigned to this common end - vertex .",
    "we are mainly interested in ( i ) the probability of a large outbreak , ( ii ) the probability that a disease spreads from one given individual to another one and ( iii ) the expected final size of an epidemic .",
    "percolation models have served before as useful tools to analyze these quantities ; see for instance @xcite for related material .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the probability measure governing the full process of assigning weights , and making the edges open or closed .",

    "a factorisable connection function is appropriate in situations in which there is at most one contact from an infectious individual to a given neighbour during its infectious period , or when only at the first contact of an infectious individual with a given neighbour the infection may be transmitted .",
    "this last assumption is proposed in some models for the spread of hiv @xcite , where the number of sexual contacts per couple can be ignored and only the number of partners is of importance . in those models",
    "the probability of an infectious contact from @xmath5 to @xmath6 is given by @xmath42 , with @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 is the length of the infectious period of individual @xmath5 and @xmath45 is the ( possibly inhomogeneous ) rate at which individual @xmath5 makes infectious contacts at time @xmath46 after its infection , and where @xmath12 is the probability that individual @xmath6 ( if still susceptible ) becomes infected at an infectious contact .",
    "the choice in ( [ mooi1 ] ) can be found in @xcite , and ( [ ggg ] ) is discussed in @xcite , both in the context of complete graphs . in neither of these two papers",
    "epidemiological interpretations of the connection functions are given .",
    "to shed some light on a possible epidemiological interpretation of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we write @xmath47 and @xmath48 when @xmath49 , we see that we can interpret these connection functions as follows : for @xmath41 , an infectious individual has a geometric-@xmath50 number of contacts with a neighbour , and each time , the probability that the infection is accepted is equal to @xmath51 . for @xmath40 ,",
    "a similar interpretation is possible , replacing the geometric number of attempts by a poisson-@xmath52 number . in both cases ,",
    "the number of attempts stochastically increases when @xmath46 grows , in accordance to our interpretation of @xmath35 as infectivity .",
    "it should be noted that ( [ mooi1 ] ) arises when the infectious period of every individual is exponentially-@xmath53 distributed and the per neighbour infection rate of individual @xmath5 is @xmath54 , while the probability that an infectious contact with susceptible individual @xmath6 leads to an infection is given by @xmath12 .",
    "if the infectious period of individual @xmath5 is @xmath44 , and during its infectious period it makes infectious contacts with every neighbour at rate @xmath55 , then the number of attempts will have a poisson-@xmath56 distribution ; hence both @xmath40 and @xmath41 arise naturally .",
    "note that replacing the combination @xmath41 and @xmath14 by @xmath40 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath53 and independent of @xmath35 , does not change the induced measure on @xmath59 .    in large randomly mixing populations it is usually assumed that the contact rate of a pair of individuals scales with @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of individuals in the population . with this assumption ,",
    "multiple contacts of a pair of individuals are rare , and the difference between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , is of order @xmath64 .",
    "we define the usual independent bond percolation measure @xmath65 as the product measure on @xmath59 in which edges are independently open with probability @xmath66 @xcite . if @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , then the induced measure of @xmath21 on @xmath59 is just @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath67 and @xmath70 , we denote the corresponding measure by @xmath71 . indeed , this measure corresponds to the edge representation of independent site percolation with parameter @xmath66 @xcite , in which an edge is open if and only if both its starting and ending vertex are open .",
    "note that although @xmath65 is defined on @xmath59 , @xmath71 is defined on the full space .",
    "this is perhaps slightly confusing , but it works best this way .    in order to state our results , we need a few definitions .",
    "an ordered set of edges in @xmath4 , @xmath72 is a ( directed ) path of length @xmath61 from @xmath73 to @xmath74 . if @xmath75 for all @xmath76 , then the path is _ self - avoiding_. it is straightforward to extend this definition to self - avoiding paths of infinite length .",
    "if we assume that a path is self - avoiding we will explicitly mention this . with some abuse of terminology",
    "we define a _ trivial path _ as a path without edges , but with a starting vertex and the same end - vertex ( i.e.  a trivial path may be seen as a single vertex ) .",
    "we say that a path is open if all edges in the path are open ; a trivial path is always open .",
    "we use the notation @xmath77 if there is at least one open path from @xmath78 to @xmath79",
    ". if the final vertex of a path @xmath80 is the first vertex of a path @xmath81 , we write @xmath82 for the _ conjunction _ of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , that is , if @xmath83 and @xmath84 , then @xmath85    for a finite or infinite path @xmath86 , we define the _ truncation of @xmath87 after @xmath61 edges _ as @xmath88 .",
    "the _ tail of @xmath87 starting after @xmath61 edges _ is defined as @xmath89 .",
    "both the truncation after @xmath61 edges and the tail starting after @xmath61 edges may be trivial paths .",
    "we are now ready to specify the collections of paths we consider in this paper .",

    "we allow for @xmath98 , which implies that if a path in a weakly hoppable collection of paths @xmath90 has a loop , then this loop can be erased and the resulting path is still in @xmath90 .",

    "if the first edge of an infinite path @xmath87 is not in @xmath99 , then the trivial path at the starting vertex of @xmath87 is in @xmath101 .",

    "most natural and useful collections of paths are hoppable .",
    "for instance , the collection of infinite paths starting at a given vertex ( or , more generally , in a finite set ) is hoppable , as is the collection of all paths from a given vertex @xmath5 to a given vertex @xmath6 ( or , more generally , from a finite set to another finite set ) . to see the first claim , we note that if @xmath90 is the collection of all infinite paths starting at a finite set , then @xmath104 for all @xmath61 and @xmath105 . if @xmath90 is the collection of all paths from a finite set to another finite set , then @xmath106 for all @xmath61 and @xmath107 .",

    "furthermore , let @xmath134 be the number of open paths in @xmath132 , i.e. , @xmath134 is the number of generation-@xmath133 vertices that can be reached by an open path from the root . for @xmath135 , and generation-1 vertex @xmath136",

    "indeed , we can adopt the point of view that for a vertex to have any offspring , it first has to accept the disease from its predecessor in the tree , and if they do so , in addition need to send the disease to the next generation .",
    "this leads to an offspring mean of @xmath145 .",
    "it now seems quite natural , given the computation above , to consider a class of probability measures for which @xmath146 is constant ( compare @xcite ) .",

    "contrary to kuulasmaa @xcite and miller @xcite , we deal with infectious diseases for which the susceptibility and infectivity of individuals might be dependent .",

    "we have chosen for this formulation because it contains most collections of interest , and also because of its elegance .",
    "one class of paths that can be seen to satisfy the results is the class of infinite _ backwards _ paths ending at a given vertex @xmath6 . indeed , by simply interchanging the role of @xmath35 and @xmath37 ( see also @xcite for this trick )",

    "this can be seen by considering @xmath32 and uncorrelated @xmath35 and @xmath37 . in that case",
    "the marginal probability that any edge @xmath17 is open is the same for all measures for which @xmath146 is constant .",
    "however , the edge density in @xmath162 is also @xmath146 and hence stochastic domination can not be used to prove theorem [ firstimpthm ] . * if @xmath4 is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath163 , and if @xmath164 and @xmath165 , then the law of the cluster of vertices that can be reached by open paths from @xmath91 on @xmath166 is the same as the law of the open cluster containing @xmath6 on the undirected counterpart of @xmath166 ( the graph obtained by replacing the two edges connecting the same vertices by 1 undirected edge ) @xcite",
    ". hence many questions on undirected graphs can be addressed as questions on directed graphs .",
