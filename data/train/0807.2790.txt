    "inflation has become the standard paradigm to understand the initial conditions for structure formation and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies . in the inflationary picture ,",
    "primordial density and gravity - wave fluctuations are generated from quantum fluctuations and stretched to superhorizon scales during an early period of accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite .",
    "such fluctuations can trigger the formation of the cmb anisotropies taking place in a later radiation- or matter - dominated epoch .",
    "cmb observations  @xcite show that the cosmological perturbations are very small , of order @xmath1 compared to the homogeneous background .",
    "this has justified the use of linear perturbation theory for a comparison with observations .",
    "there are however two good reasons to go beyond linear order .",
    "one is the possibility of observing some amount of non - gaussianity in the cmb anisotropies , revealing fundamental details about the mechanism generating the primordial density perturbations .",
    "this issue is being deeply investigated at present , especially because of the high sensitivity to non - gaussianity of the planck satellite  @xcite and its successors .",
    "such non - gaussianities are sourced by self - interactions in the early universe and become visible at the level of second- or higher - order perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "another reason to go beyond linear order is to look at the loop corrections the self - interactions of any scalar field during an inflationay phase ( and more interestingly of the curvature perturbation @xmath2 ) can generate in the cosmological correlators , including the observationally interesting cases of the two- and the three - point correlation functions ( or , in fourier space , the power spectrum and the bispectrum , respectively ) .",
    "loop corrections may lead to interesting effects which scale like the power of the number of e - folds between horizon exit of a given mode @xmath3 and the end of inflation  @xcite .",
    "recently there has been some renewed interest in loop corrections to the correlators of cosmological perturbations generated during an early epoch of inflation , stimulated by two papers of weinberg  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that one - loop corrections to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath2 seem to show some infra - red divergences which scale like @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is some infra - red comoving momentum cut - off .",
    "@xcite .. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the scale factor at the beginning of inflation , the logarithm becomes @xmath8 , which is proportional to the number of e - folds between the beginning of inflation and the time the mode @xmath3 leaves the horizon ( when @xmath9 ) .",
    "this would have a dramatic impact for the control of cosmological perturbation theory and in particular for the comparison of inflationary predictions for the primordial density perturbations with observations .",
    "] however it has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) that such potentially large corrections do not appear in quantities that are directly observable .",
    "indeed they concern variations of background quantities defined within a region of comoving size @xmath10 not much larger than the present horizon @xmath11 when one considers how they change on scales @xmath12 much larger than the size @xmath10 .",
    "such variations will be then associated to infrared corrections which however are not related to the local observable quantities .",
    "this means that loop corrections are under control because it is justified to choose for the infrared momentum cut - off the scale @xmath10 not much larger than the present horizon @xmath11 .    independently of this issue ,",
    "up to now the computations of one - loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations have neglected any contribution arising from the graviton excitations ( or tensor perturbation modes ) which are unavoidably generated during a quasi de - sitter phase . in particular ,",
    "when going beyond linear order , a mixing of scalar and tensor perturbations is inevitable as well . in this paper",
    "we compute for the first time the graviton effects at one - loop level to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath2 in single - field models of slow - roll inflation .",
    "our results show that such corrections are of the same order as those obtained by considering only the loops from scalar self - interactions ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "this further strengthens the point that a full self - consistent computation of one- ( or higher - order ) loop corrections to the correlation functions of primordial curvature perturbations must necessarily account for the graviton contribution inside the loops .",
    "loop corrections in general appear to be small , neverthless an evaluation as precise as possible is required .",
    "however notice that , interestingly enough , we find also for the graviton - loop contributions terms which scale like @xmath13 .",
    "most of the computation consists in deriving the quantum corrections due to gravitons to the two - point function of the inflaton field @xmath14 around the time of horizon crossing .",
    "this is achieved using the in - in , also dubbed schwinger - keldysh , formalism  @xcite .",
    "their contribution to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation @xmath2 on superhorizon scales is then obtained by exploiting the @xmath0 formalism  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 formalism allows to obtain an expression for the curvature perturbation @xmath16 ( in the uniform density gauge ) in terms of the scalar field(s ) fluctuations [ dn ] ( , t)=_n((,t_*))^n , where @xmath17 represents the derivative of the number of e - folds ( between the final time @xmath18 and some initial time @xmath19 ) with respect to the initial value of the scalar field ( in the spatially flat gauge ) . on superhorizon scales during inflation , eq .",
    "( [ dn ] ) represents the perturbation in the number of e - folds of expansion between widely separated hubble regions due to the initial fluctuations of the scalar field @xmath20 .",
    "in fact the time @xmath19 is left to be freely chosen , as long as it is set after horizon crossing , since at that time the perturbations will have settled to their classical value .",
    "one possibility is to take @xmath18 to fall a few e - foldings after horizon crossing like for example in @xcite ; we will adopt this choice , motivated by the possibility of simplifying our analysis and calculations ( we will provide details about this matter in section 3 ) .",
    "+ the reader might be worried about the validity of the @xmath0 expansion  ( [ dn ] ) when tensor perturbation modes @xmath21 are accounted for , since they introduce an additional degree of freedom .",
    "in fact the @xmath0 formalism holds also in this case .",
    "the reason can be simply understood by considering that the spatial perturbed metric can be written as  @xcite @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the unperturbed scale factor , see also eq .",
    "( [ smetric ] ) ) and , on superhorizon scales , the tensor modes can always be reabsorbed into a rescaling of the coordinates .  ) can be found , e.g. , in  @xcite , and amounts to consider that @xmath24 has unit determinant so that it does not modify the local volume defined in terms of the local scale factor @xmath25 . ]",

    "a possible classification for theories of inflation is the one that distinguishes between a canonical and non - canonical form for the kinetic term in the lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the latter are particularly interesting for the study of non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "we derive the solutions to the constraint equations for a general non - canonical lagrangian but our loop calculations will be focused on the canonical case ( we will cover the study of the tensor corrections in the non canonical case both for the power spectrum and the trispectrum of the curvature perturbations in a companion work @xcite ) .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we calculate the complete action to fourth order in the spatially flat gauge ; in section 3 we study the graviton one - loop corrections to the power spectrum of the inflaton field perturbations ; in section 4 we collect our results together with the one - loop corrections from scalar perturbation modes which have been already computed in ref .",
