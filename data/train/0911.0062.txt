    "controlling quantum phenomena has been an implicit goal even since the establishment of quantum mechanics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "many practical tasks arising from atomic physics @xcite , molecular chemistry @xcite , @xcite-@xcite and quantum optics @xcite can be formulated as quantum control problems .",
    "it is desired to develop quantum control theory to establish a firm theoretic footing for the active control of quantum systems .",
    "quantum control theory has played an important role in guiding the control of chemical reactions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , the development of quantum control theory has been recognized as a key task required to establish practical quantum information technology @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . some useful tools from classical control theory , such as optimal control theory @xcite , @xcite and feedback control approaches",
    "@xcite-@xcite have been applied to problems of population transfer , quantum state preparation , quantum error correction and decoherence control @xcite .",
    "although some useful results have already been obtained , research on quantum control is still in its infancy . from the perspective of practical applications ,",
    "it is inevitable that there exist uncertainties and disturbances in external fields , system hamiltonians or initial states @xcite .",
    "many cases of unknown information and errors can also be treated as uncertainties .",
    "hence , the requirement of a certain degree of robustness in the presence of uncertainties and noises has been recognized as one of the key aspects for developing practical quantum technologies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "several approaches have been introduced to enhance the robustness of quantum systems .",
    "for example , zhang and rabitz @xcite used a minmax approach to analyze the robustness of molecular systems . in @xcite , james and coworkers have formulated and solved a quantum robust control problem using a @xmath0 method for linear quantum stochastic systems . in this paper , we develop a new sliding mode control approach to enhance the robustness of quantum systems . sliding mode control ( smc ) is a useful robust control strategy in classical control theory and industrial applications @xcite-@xcite .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite have briefly discussed the possible application of sliding mode control to quantum systems .",
    "this paper will formally present sliding mode control methods for quantum systems to deal with uncertainties .",
    "the sliding mode control approach generally includes two main steps : selecting a sliding surface ( sliding mode ) and controlling the system state to and maintaining it in this sliding surface . the sliding surface guarantees that the quantum system has desired dynamics in this surface",
    ". we will select an eigenstate of the free hamiltonian or a state subspace of the controlled quantum system as a sliding mode . to control the system state to and then maintain it in this sliding surface , most feedback control methods in classical control theory are not directly applicable since we generally can not acquire measurement feedback information without destroying the quantum system state .",
    "it is necessary to develop new approaches to accomplish this task .",
    "hence , we propose two new unique methods for this task : one method involves combining time - optimal control design and periodic projective measurements for the case where an eigenstate is taken as the sliding mode ; the other method is implemented through quantum amplitude amplification and periodic projective measurements for the case where a state subspace is identified as a sliding mode .",
    "it is worth noting that an important assumption required in the proposed methods is that accurate projective measurements ( using the eigenstates of the free hamiltonian as the measurement basis ) are possible .",
    "a connection to the quantum zeno effect is briefly discussed and two specific examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed methods .",
    "the main feature of our methods is their robustness to uncertainties in system hamiltonians .",
    "the sliding mode control method has potential applications to preparation of quantum states and quantum error correction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 defines two classes of candidate sliding modes and formulates the two quantum control problems considered in this paper . in section 3 we present a sliding mode control method combining time - optimal control design and periodic projective measurements for quantum systems where an eigenstate is identified as a sliding mode .",
    "an illustrative example of a two - level quantum system is analyzed in detail .",
    "section 4 proposes a control design method using quantum amplitude amplification and periodic projective measurements for controlling quantum systems when the sliding mode is a state subspace .",
    "an example of a three - level system is presented to demonstrate the proposed method .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "in this paper , we consider finite dimensional ( @xmath1-level ) quantum systems whose dynamic evolution is described as follows ( setting @xmath2 in this paper ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the free hamiltonian , @xmath5 is the external control , and @xmath6 is a set of time - independent hamiltonian operators .",
    "if the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates of @xmath4 are denoted as @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) , respectively , @xmath10 can be expanded as : @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is hermitian which ensures that the transition from a pure state @xmath13 to another @xmath10 can be accomplished through a unitary transformation @xmath14 ; i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "the control problem is converted into the problem that given an initial state and a target state , find a set of controls @xmath16 in ( [ controlled model ] ) or a unitary transformation @xmath14 to drive the controlled system from the initial state into the target state .",
    "sliding mode control ( smc ) is a useful approach to robust controller design for electromechanical systems @xcite . in smc ,",
    "a sliding surface ( sliding mode ) and a switching function are determined @xcite .",
    "a sliding mode is generally defined as a specified state region where the system has desired dynamic behavior .",
    "a switching function is designed to control the system state to the sliding mode .",
    "smc has two main advantages @xcite : ( i ) the dynamic behavior of the system may be determined by the particular choice of switching function ; ( ii ) the closed - loop response becomes totally insensitive to a particular class of uncertainties .",
    "it is the order reduction property and low sensitivity to uncertainty that makes smc an efficient tool for controlling complex high - order systems subject to uncertainties @xcite .",
    "to apply the idea of smc to quantum systems , we first need to define a sliding mode where the quantum system has desired dynamics .",
    "a sliding mode can be represented as a functional of the state @xmath17 and hamiltonian @xmath18 ; i.e. , @xmath19 . for example",
    ", an eigenstate @xmath20 of @xmath4 can be selected as a sliding surface . in this case",
    ", we can define @xmath21 . if the initial state @xmath22 is in the sliding mode",
    "; i.e. , @xmath23 , we can easily prove that the quantum system will maintain its state in this surface under the action of the free hamiltonian @xmath4 only .",
    "in fact , @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 that is , an eigenstate of @xmath4 can be identified as a sliding mode .",
    "more generally , an invariant state subspace of a quantum system satisfying @xmath19 can be defined as a sliding mode .",
    "for example , the wavefunction controllable subspace considered in @xcite can be identified as a sliding mode . considering a simple control @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath28 in ( [ controlled model ] ) ) and substituting ( [ superpositionstate ] ) into ( [ controlled model ] ) , we denote @xmath29 and can obtain @xcite , @xcite : @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to the operators @xmath4 and @xmath34 ( i.e. , @xmath28 in ( [ controlled model ] ) ) , respectively .",
    "consider the model i presented in @xcite , @xmath35 where the free hamiltonian of the five - level system is @xmath36 @xcite and the control hamiltonian @xmath37 is as follows : @xmath38    in @xcite , we have proven that the subspace @xmath39 spanned by @xmath40 is a wavefunction controllable subspace @xcite .",
    "we may select @xmath39 as a sliding surface .",
    "we can easily prove that if the initial state of this system is in this sliding surface , its state will be maintained in this surface under the action of hamiltonian @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , we can express the sliding mode as follows : @xmath42 if @xmath43 , we can obtain @xmath44 . from @xmath45 ,",
    "it is clear that we can obtain @xmath46 .",
    "now we obtain the following equation from ( [ model1 ] ) : @xmath47 after straightforward calculations we obtain the following relationship : @xmath48 from this , it is clear that @xmath49 .",
    "that is , @xmath44 ; i.e. , the state of this system will be maintained in this surface under the action of hamiltonian @xmath41 .",
    "some other state subspaces such as decoherence - free subspace @xcite , @xcite can also be defined as sliding modes . however",
    ", this paper will focus on the two particular classes of sliding modes .",
    "the first class corresponds to a sliding mode which is an eigenstate .",
    "the second class corresponds to a sliding mode which is a wavefunction controllable subspace .      in the above subsection ,",
    "we have presented two candidate sliding modes .",
    "if a quantum system state is driven into a sliding mode , the state will be maintained in the sliding surface under the action of some class of hamiltonians determined by the sliding mode .",
    "however , in practical applications , it is inevitable that there exist noises and uncertainties in system hamiltonians , initial states or control fields .",
    "an important advantage of sliding mode control is its robustness against uncertainties .",
    "our main motivation of introducing sliding mode control to quantum systems is to deal with these uncertainties . in this paper , we focus on the class of uncertainties which can be approximated as a perturbation in the system hamiltonian . for example , the unitary error in @xcite and the operational error in a quantum logic gate can be classified into this class of uncertainties .",
    "we also suppose that the uncertainties are bounded .",
    "we represent the uncertainties as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 is a set of time - independent hamiltonian operators .",
    "we further suppose that the system is completely controllable  @xcite .",
    "the control problem under consideration is stated as follows : for a given initial state , design a control law to steer the quantum system state into and then maintain the state in a sliding mode domain ( a neighborhood containing the sliding mode ) in the presence of bounded uncertainties in the system hamiltonian .",
    "this quantum sliding mode control problem is greatly different from the traditional sliding mode control .",
    "once the uncertainties take the state slightly away from the sliding mode , there is always a finite probability ( we call it the probability of failure ) that the system state will collapse out of the sliding mode domain when one makes a measurement on this system .",
    "hence , if the allowed probability of failure is @xmath55 , we may define the sliding mode domain @xmath56 .",
    "we expect that the control law can ensure that the system state remains in the sliding mode domain @xmath57 except that a measurement operation may take it away from @xmath57 with a small probability ( not greater than @xmath55 ) .",
    "the quantum sliding mode control problem includes three main subtasks : ( i ) for any initial state ( assumed to be known ) , design a control law to drive the system state into a defined sliding mode domain @xmath57 ; ( ii ) design a control law to maintain the system state in @xmath57 ; ( iii ) design a control law to drive the system state back to @xmath57 if a measurement takes it away from @xmath57 . for convenience , we suppose that there exist no uncertainties during the control processes ( i ) and ( iii ) . in particular , we consider the following two quantum control problems .",
    "\\(1 ) quantum control problem 1 ( * qcp1 * ) : for an uncertain quantum system in which an eigenstate @xmath20 of @xmath4 defines a sliding mode ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) , ( i ) drive the controlled quantum system state into the sliding mode domain @xmath59 ; ( ii ) maintain the system state in @xmath57 except that measurements may take it away from @xmath57 with at most probability @xmath55 ; ( iii ) if the system state is taken away from @xmath57 , design a control law to drive it back to @xmath57 .",

    "in this section , we consider * qcp1 * , in which an eigenstate is identified as a sliding mode .",
    "our first task is to design a control law to drive the system state to this chosen sliding surface .",
    "since we ignore the effect of uncertainties during the control processes ( i ) and ( iii ) , we wish to accomplish this task as quickly as possible .",
    "hence , we will use a time - optimal control approach for this task . for the subtask ( ii ) , we use periodic projective measurements to achieve our goal . in coherent control ,",
    "measurement is usually regarded as having deleterious effects .",
    "recent results have shown that quantum measurements can be combined with unitary transformations to complete some quantum manipulation tasks and enhance the capability of quantum control @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for example , vilela mendes and manko @xcite showed that nonunitarily controllable systems might become controllable by using ",
    "measurement plus evolution \" .",
    "_ @xcite have used sequential measurements to control quantum systems .",
    "rabitz and coworkers @xcite-@xcite have demonstrated that projective measurements can serve as a control tool . in this section , we will combine time - optimal control and periodic projective measurements to accomplish sliding mode control of quantum systems .",
    "the steps of the control algorithm for * qcp1 * are as follows :    1 .",
    "select an eigenstate @xmath20 of @xmath4 as a sliding mode @xmath19 ; 2 .   for a known initial state @xmath22 , design a time - optimal control law that can drive @xmath22 to the sliding mode @xmath63 ; 3 .   for eigenstates @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , design corresponding time - optimal control laws that can drive @xmath64 to @xmath63 using a similar method to that in ( ii ) ; 4 .   for given @xmath55 and @xmath66 , design the period @xmath67 for the projective measurements ; 5 .   use the designed control law to drive the system state to @xmath63 , then implement periodic projective measurements with the period @xmath67 to maintain the system state in @xmath68 .",
    "if the state collapses to @xmath64 due to a measurement , we use the corresponding control law to drive it to @xmath63 and then continue to make periodic projective measurements .    from the above",
    ", we can see that the design of a time - optimal control law and the selection of the period @xmath67 for projective measurements are the two most important tasks in this control algorithm .",
    "the time - optimal control problem has been an interesting topic in quantum control , in which it is required to design a control law to achieve a desired state transfer in a minimum time in order to minimize the effects of relaxation and decoherence @xcite , @xcite .",
    "khaneja and coworkers @xcite have studied time - optimal control of spin systems under the assumption of unbounded controls .",
    "boscain and mason @xcite have investigated the time - optimal control problem for a spin @xmath69 system with bounded controls . for several simple quantum systems ( e.g. , two - level systems ) ,",
    "it is possible to obtain analytical results .",
    "however , it is generally difficult to find a complete solution for high - dimensional quantum systems . in these cases",
    ", it may be useful to develop a numerical simulation method to find an approximate solution .",
    "another important task is to design the measurement period @xmath67 so that the control law can guarantee control performance .",
    "an extreme case occurs when @xmath70 .",
    "that is , after the quantum system state is driven into the sliding mode , we make frequent measurements .",
    "this corresponds to the quantum zeno effect @xcite which can guarantee that the state is maintained in the sliding mode in spite of the existence of uncertainties .",
    "however , it is a difficult task to make such frequent measurements in practical applications .",
    "we may think that the smaller @xmath67 is , the bigger the cost of measurements becomes .",
    "hence , we wish to design a period @xmath67 which is as large as possible , when we have a bound @xmath71 on the uncertainties and require a probability of failure @xmath55 . in the following subsection , we will present a specific example of a two - level quantum system to demonstrate how to design the period @xmath67 .",
    "it is clear that the sliding mode control approach can be used in the preparation and protection of quantum states under uncertainty conditions .",
    "moreover , if the initial state is unknown , we can first make a projective measurement .",
    "if the result is the eigenstate @xmath72 , we would continue to implement periodic projective measurements to maintain the system state in @xmath57 .",
    "otherwise , we would use a corresponding control law to drive the system state to @xmath63 .",
    "this slight amendment to our approach enables our method to achieve robustness against variations in the initial state as well as robustness to uncertainties in the system hamiltonian .      to demonstrate the proposed method , here we consider a two - level quantum system , which can be used as a quantum bit ( qubit ) and has important potential applications in quantum information . in practical applications",

    "( 2 ) the connection between the proposed methods and quantum error correction and quantum state preparation has been discussed .",
    "however , the specific applications still require to be developed in detail . moreover , we use two model systems as the examples to illustrate the proposed methods .",
    "a future task is to connect such model systems to specific quantum systems ( e.g. , quantum optical systems and spin systems ) and to consider the experimental implementation of the proposed methods for such real quantum systems .",
