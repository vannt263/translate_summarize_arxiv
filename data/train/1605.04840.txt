    "for simplicity we will always assume that @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we address the following question : what is the necessary and sufficient condition on @xmath2 , real numbers @xmath10 and a measure @xmath6 such that the following inequality holds @xmath11 for all borel measurable @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are strictly positive numbers .",

    "our main result is the following theorem .",
    "[ mth1 ] suppose that @xmath15 and @xmath16 never vanish in @xmath17 . for inequality ( [ ragaca ] ) to hold it is necessary that @xmath18 moreover , if @xmath19 is a gaussian measure then the above conditions are also sufficient .    by gaussian measure we mean a probability measure of the form @xmath20 the symbols @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote partial derivatives .",

    "constraint @xmath25 on numbers @xmath26 in ( [ numbers ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath27 and @xmath28 . moreover , if @xmath29 then it is necessary that @xmath30 is the zero vector . in the applications usually @xmath31 .",
    "therefore the most important condition the reader needs to keep in mind is the partial differential inequality ( pdi ) in ( [ numbers ] ) .",
    "we should also notice an _ independence from the dimension _",
    ", i.e. , the necessity conditions follow from the one dimensional case @xmath32 , and for the gaussian measures ( [ numbers ] ) is sufficient for ( [ ragaca ] ) to hold for all @xmath33 . in section  [ proof1 ]",
    "we present the proof of theorem  [ mth1 ] .",
    "we should mention that ( [ numbers ] ) already appeared in @xcite as a sufficient condition for inequality ( [ ragaca ] ) to hold in case of the gaussian measure with supremum in ( [ ragaca ] ) and smooth compactly supported functions @xmath34 .",
    "namely , it was proved in @xcite that if @xmath35 are nonvanishing and @xmath2 satisfies ( [ numbers ] ) then the following inequality holds @xmath36 for all smooth compactly supported functions @xmath34 and the gaussian measure @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , in @xcite inequality ( [ weaker ] ) was obtained in more general setting where one can allow @xmath2 to have arbitrary number of variables and supremum in ( [ weaker ] ) is taken over an affine subspace of @xmath7 . by slightly extending the class of test functions in ( [ weaker ] ) ( which can be done by using the methods in @xcite ) one can derive ( [ ragaca ] ) from ( [ weaker ] ) by using some subtle approximation arguments , the fact that @xmath2 is monotone in each variable and elaborating an argument used in appendix of @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we still prefer to directly work with ( [ ragaca ] ) .",
    "our first immediate extension is that we have ( [ ragaca ] ) with essential supremum and borel measurable functions .",
    "our second extension is that we obtain if and only if characterization , moreover we obtain the necessity part for almost arbitrary measures .",
    "our approach to ( [ ragaca ] ) sheds light to a question about _ optimizers _ , and it provides us with some quantitative version of ( [ ragaca ] ) ( see lemma  [ lem-5 ] and lemma  [ lem-7 ] which are interesting in itself ) , and it shows a link between two different type of pdes considered in @xcite ( see pde ( 1.3 ) and ( 1.5 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "our proof is completely different from the methods developed in @xcite . in particular , we obtain the new proof of the ehrhard inequality .",
    "the main idea of the current paper is based on two arguments : one of brascamp ",
    "lieb @xcite rewriting essential supremum as the limit of @xmath37 norms , and the other one is a subtle inequality which was studied and developed only recently in @xcite .    in section  [ degenerate ]",
    "we give answers to the questions : what happens in theorem  [ mth1 ] when @xmath15 and @xmath16 vanish in @xmath17 .",
    "it turns out that in this degenerate case the problem depends very much on the class of test functions @xmath38 , namely , it matters whether @xmath38 are continuous or discontinuous functions .    in section  [ app ]",
    "we illustrate various applications of the theorem .",
    "the first immediate application is the ehrhard inequality .",
    "this corresponds to the function @xmath39 which does satisfy ( [ numbers ] ) where @xmath40 is the gaussian distribution function . in theorem  [ theorem2 ] and",
    "corollary  [ last3 ] we find necessary conditions on the probability measures @xmath6 which satisfy the functional version of the ehrhard inequality in dimension one where the gaussian distribution @xmath40 is replaced by the distribution of @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath41)$ ] . as a corollary ( see corollary  [ even - measure ] ) we show that in the class of even probability measures the gaussian measure is the only one which satisfies the functional form of the ehrhard inequality on the real line .",
    "another immediate application is the prkopa  leindler inequality .",
    "this corresponds to the function @xmath42 with @xmath31 which also does satisfy ( [ numbers ] ) . in subsection  [ lebeg - hom ]",
    "we describe @xmath43-homogeneous functions @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath44 for all @xmath45 , and measures @xmath6 which satisfy ( [ ragaca ] ) .",
    "it turns out that in this particular class of functions the description is simple : @xmath2 is a convex function , or @xmath2 is one of the counterparts of the prkopa  leindler functions : @xmath46 with @xmath31 , @xmath47 with @xmath48 , and @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the last two functions provide us with a natural extension of the prkopa  leindler inequality for any real power @xmath51 ( see corollary  [ character ] ) . in the case @xmath46 as it is well known the only possible measures which satisfy ( [ ragaca ] ) must be log - concave measures . on the other hand appearance of the convex functions",
    "@xmath2 makes it clear that some of the inequalities of the form ( [ ragaca ] ) are trivial consequences of the jensen s inequality ( see proposition  [ jensen2 ] and remark  [ trivial ] ) .    in subsection  [ universality - prekopa ]",
    "we characterize all smooth concave functions @xmath2 which satisfy ( [ ragaca ] ) for a probability measure @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath2 must satisfy homogeneous monge  ampre equation , and as a consequence of this , it generically must be the prkopa ",
    "leindler function @xmath52 with @xmath31 , or one of its counterpart ( see proposition  [ conc - sol ] ) .",
    "thus we observe some universality of the prkopa  leindler inequality , as a unique reverse to jensen s inequality .    section  [ other ] illustrates other examples of @xmath2 such that ( [ ragaca ] ) holds for the gaussian measure ( see corollary  [ ee-1 ] , [ ee-2 ] and [ ee-3 ] ) . in section",
    "[ come - back ] we explain how theorem  [ mth1 ] allows to restore the ehrhard inequality by solving pde problem over an obstacle .",
    "i am grateful to christos saroglou who initiated this project and with whom i had many discussions .",
    "he should be considered as co - author ( despite his insistence to the contrary ) .",
    "i am extremely thankful to the kent state analysis group especially fedor nazarov who gave me some valuable suggestions in obtaining the necessity part , and artem zvavitch for providing c.  borell s lecture notes .",
    "the talk given by grigoris paouris on the informal analysis seminar at kent state university served as a guide and inspiration for the present article .",

    "ideally we want to choose @xmath78 for all @xmath79 but then the image of @xmath38 will escape from the rectangle @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "unfortunately , we can not just make it compactly supported ( i.e. , multiply by some cutoff function ) as we will see from the computations given below .",

    "first we should compare small order terms in order to get a restriction on @xmath89 .",
    "since @xmath34 are continuous clearly the essential supremum of the integrand in ( [ ragaca ] ) becomes @xmath90 .",
    "thus , introducing new variables @xmath91 and using the fact that supremum of the sum is at most the sum of the supremums , we obtain that ( [ ragaca ] ) implies the inequality @xmath92    notice that @xmath93 for @xmath94 and it is bounded as @xmath95 otherwise .",

    "<S> we obtain the necessary conditions on @xmath2 in terms of partial differential inequalities , and in case of gaussian measures we show that these conditions are also sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> we completely describe convex , concave and 1-homogeneous functions @xmath2 which satisfy our necessary conditions , moreover , we illustrate some other nontrivial examples . as an immediate application we obtain the new proof of the ehrhard inequality . in particular , we show that in the class of even probability measures the gaussian measure is the only one which satisfies the functional form of the ehrhard inequality on the real line with their own distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on two arguments : one of brascamp  lieb rewriting the essential supremum as a limit of @xmath3 norms , and the other one is a subtle inequality which is an extension of the classical brascamp  </S>",
    "<S> lieb inequality recently developed for the gaussian measures .    </S>",
