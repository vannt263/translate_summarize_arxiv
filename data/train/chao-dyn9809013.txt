    "wavefunction scarring , the enhancement or suppression of quantum eigenstate intensity along an unstable orbit of the corresponding classical system , is a fascinating and generic property of quantum chaotic behavior . along with dynamical localization ,",
    "it is one of the striking ways in which a quantum system can show deviation from ergodicity at the single - channel level even though the classical dynamics is completely ergodic .",
    "wavefunction intensities near a short unstable periodic orbit follow a distribution far from that predicted by random matrix theory ( rmt ) , with some wavefunctions having much more intensity and other much less than would be predicted based on gaussian random fluctuations .",
    "the phenomenon is at first glance paradoxical , because the long - time ( and indeed stationary ) quantum behavior retains a memory of the short - time classical motion , a memory that is completely absent in the long time _",
    "classical _ dynamics of a chaotic system .",
    "scarring has been observed experimentally in a wide variety of systems , including microwave cavities@xcite , semiconductor structures@xcite , and the hydrogen atom in a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "a theory of scarring based on the linearized evolution of gaussian wavepackets was first provided in  @xcite ; later theoretical work by bogomolny@xcite in coordinate space and berry@xcite in wigner phase space followed .",
    "these made predictions about the average intensity on a classical periodic orbit of states in a given energy band ; however , because of the energy smoothing involved , no predictions were possible about the statistical properties of individual peak heights in the local density of states .",
    "more recently a nonlinear theory was developed  @xcite which made it possible to predict the statistical properties of individual wavefunctions , in the semiclassical limit .",
    "a homoclinic orbit analysis showed that long - time return amplitude to the vicinity of a periodic orbit bore the imprint of the short - time linearized classical dynamics around the periodic orbit .",
    "this leads to a natural separation of scarring intensity into a classical short - time component and a random long - time component , as suggested already in@xcite .",
    "in@xcite , predictions were made about the distribution of wavefunction intensities on a periodic orbit and at a generic point in phase space .",
    "the full distribution of intensities , which includes samples taken over all of phase space , has a long tail ( compared to the porter - thomas prediction of rmt ) , dominated by the effect of the least unstable periodic orbit .",
    "the functional form of this tail is given in the semiclassical ( high - energy ) limit very simply in terms of the stability exponent of this least unstable orbit , as long as an optimally - oriented test basis is chosen .",
    "furthermore , upon ensemble averaging a power - law intensity distribution tail is obtained , in sharp contrast with the exponential tail predicted by rmt .",
    "this result is also to be contrasted with the log - normal intensity distribution tail which obtains in diffusive systems  @xcite .",
    "thus , although rmt is accepted as the zeroth - order approximation for both chaotic and disordered quantum systems , deviations from rmt predictions can be qualitatively different in the two cases , providing an impetus for the present research .",
    "the numerically tested quantitative predictions in  @xcite concerned the local densities of states of closed systems .",
    "experimentally , certain properties of open systems , such as resonance widths and conductances may be more amenable to experimental verification  @xcite .",
    "much work has been done here within the context of rmt  @xcite ; deviations from rmt in disordered systems have also been considered@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we address the distribution of decay lifetimes in a leaky chaotic system , and the probability to remain in such a system@xcite as a function of time and the location of the  leak \" ( open channel ) .",
    "the distribution in phase space of the remaining probability density at long times is considered , as well as the dependence of the probability to remain on where the particle was first  injected \" into the system .",
    "these last two questions bring us into contact with wavefunction correlations and transport in chaotic systems , which ( as we show ) can be very different from rmt expectations where periodic orbits are involved . all the quantitative predictions which follow are tested numerically .",
    "a study of conductance properties in two - lead chaotic systems , including mean conductance , conductance fluctuations , distribution of peak heights , and peak correlations ( and how all these depend on the placement of one or both leads in relation to the classical orbits ) is forthcoming  @xcite .",
    "we begin by considering a small opening in a classically chaotic system , which allows a particle to escape from the system . we will often use language suggesting that the  opening \" is defined in position space , as it would often be , for example , in a mesoscopic experiment .",
    "however , the formalism considered here is much more general : all that is required is that the opening be localized in the classical _ phase space _ ; escape routes that are defined exclusively in terms of position or momentum are special cases of this .",
    "a simple example of a momentum space opening is a potential barrier that allows particles to leave only if their momentum is directed almost normal to the wall@xcite .",
    "an opening having the shape of a phase - space gaussian naturally occurs when one considers tunneling out of a metastable chaotic well formed by a continuous potential  @xcite .",
    "now we can imagine forming a mesh in classical phase space with each cell the size of the opening ; because the classical dynamics ( in the closed system ) is chaotic , probability density starting in one such cell will soon be evenly distributed over all the available cells .",
    "the time for this to happen is logarithmic in the size of the opening @xmath0 : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the lyapunov exponent of the classical dynamics ( the mean rate of chaotic divergence of classical orbits ) , and the total size of phase space , in terms of which @xmath0 must be measured , has been set to unity . on the other hand ,",
    "the escape time from the system is inversely proportional to the leak size @xmath0 , so a small value of @xmath0 will cause complete mixing of the remaining probability to take place on a time scale much shorter than the scale on which probability is leaking out .",
    "one obvious consequence is that the probability to remain in the open classical system follows an exponential law .",
    "this behavior is , of course , independent of the position of the leak .",
    "also , density is constantly redistributing itself , so that the remaining probability density remains evenly distributed on the scale of our mesh , except in a corridor of length scaling as @xmath3 leading forward in time from the position of the opening . notice that the width of this corridor where the probability to remain is suppressed scales as the size of the opening .",
    "thus , this corridor has no effect on the quantum behavior when the opening is small compared to @xmath4 .",
    "finally , even if the initial probability is not evenly distributed over the entire phase space , the long - time behavior is unaffected ( as long as the bulk of the probability is not initially placed in a corridor similar to the one described above , but leading _ backwards _ in time from the opening ) .",
    "in contrast to these results , we will find in the quantum case that the probability to remain in the system at long times depends strongly on whether the opening is located on a classical ( unstable ) periodic orbit , even though the initial probability density is evenly distributed .",
    "again , we see that long - time quantum behavior retains a better memory of short - time classical dynamics than does the long - time classical behavior .",
    "also , we will see that given a leak placed on a periodic orbit , the remaining probability distribution at long times can be strongly affected not just on the periodic orbit itself , but also on the _ other _ short periodic orbits of the system .",
    "enhancement or suppression can be observed depending on the energy range considered and on the classical actions of the orbits in question .",
    "similarly , the probability to remain at long times will be affected if the original probability is injected on an unstable periodic orbit different from the one where the opening is located .",
    "all this is true even though the decay is taking place on a time scale much longer than any other time scale in the problem ( the period of the short orbit , the mixing time , and also the heisenberg time , i.e. , the inverse of the mean level spacing ) .",
    "let the quantization of our classical system be given by an @xmath5dimensional hilbert space ( @xmath6 is the number of planck - sized cells in the classical phase space ) , with dynamics in the closed system given by the hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "if the opening is very small ( less than one open channel , so that the resonances are non - overlapping ) , we can write an effective hamiltonian for the open system : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a quantum channel associated with the opening , and @xmath10 is the decay rate in that channel ( taken to be small )",
    ". @xmath11 could be a gaussian wavepacket enclosing the hole , or a position or momentum state .",
    "it is important to note here that the opening is small compared to @xmath4 ( less than half a wavelength if in position space ) .",
    "one can of course consider large openings , or ones which are not thus localized to a single channels ; these possibilities are considered towards the end of the present paper .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the phenomenon discussed here is already present in its full form for the tiniest single opening , without the complications that arise in the more general case .    for a small hole ,",
    "the main effect of the opening on a wavefunction @xmath12 of the closed system is that it acquires a decay width proportional to the intensity of the wavefunction at the opening :",
    "@xmath13 if the intensities @xmath14 follow a chi - squared distribution , as in rmt , we have probability @xmath15 for real overlaps @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for complex overlaps .",
    "consider the complex case . because mixing between the states of the closed system can be neglected in the small @xmath10 regime , the total probability to remain in the system is given by a sum over these states : @xmath18 [ remember that @xmath6 is the total number of states in the system ; the classical decay rate is given by @xmath19 because only one channel has the possibility to decay .",
    "] we see that at short times ( @xmath20 ) , the probability to remain in the system is @xmath21 , as expected , while at long times we have the asymptotic behavior @xmath22 in the case of @xmath23 independent weakly open channels , i.e. @xmath24 the classical decay rate is given by @xmath25 and the rmt probability to remain is @xmath26 taking @xmath27 while keeping the total decay rate @xmath28 constant , exponential decay consistent with the classical prediction is obtained . on the other hand , fixing the number of channels @xmath23 and taking @xmath29 , we observe the power - law behavior @xmath30    the case of real overlaps @xmath16 follows similarly : each real random overlap counts as half of a complex one , so there @xmath31 . in the literature",
    "one often considers the distribution of delay times for scattering off of the system in question : there one must include the probability of populating a given resonance in the first place , which of course is proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "this leads to an extra factor of @xmath33 in the denominator , giving @xmath34 for complex overlaps and @xmath35 for real overlaps . in our case",
    ", we imagine the system to be populated first , before the lead is opened up , and thus no extra power of @xmath33 is present .",
    "we now go beyond rmt to consider the effect of real dynamics on the quantum probability to remain in a classically chaotic system .",
    "take the channel @xmath9 to be on or near an ( unstable ) periodic orbit of instability exponent @xmath36 .",
    "the smoothed local density of states at @xmath9 is obtained by fourier transforming its short - time autocorrelation function , which is easily obtained by linearizing the classical equations of motion near the unstable orbit  @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , if the periodic orbit in question is a fixed point of a discrete time map , and @xmath9 is a gaussian wavepacket optimally aligned along the stable and unstable manifolds of the orbit , the short - time autocorrelation function is given by @xmath37 here @xmath38 is a phase associated with one iteration of the orbit : it is given by the classical action in units of @xmath4 , plus a maslov phase as appropriate .",
    "the subscript  lin \" indicates that the expression is obtained within the linearized classical approximation ; it is valid on time scales short compared to the mixing time @xmath39 .    a more general form of eq .",
    "[ alin ] applies for a non - optimally oriented wavepacket ( e.g. a position or momentum channel could be non - optimal depending on the direction of the invariant manifolds at the periodic point ) , and also for a channel not exactly centered on a periodic point @xcite . in particular , for a wavepacket centered on the periodic orbit but not optimally oriented with respect to its invariant manifolds , the form above becomes @xmath40 in eq .",
    "[ alingen ] , @xmath41 is a non - optimality parameter : in a coordinate system where the stable and unstable manifolds are orthogonal , @xmath41 is a function of the angle between the orientation of the phase - space gaussian ( at some fixed eccentricity ) and either of these two directions . alternatively ,",
    "if the wavepacket @xmath9 is fixed to have a circular shape in phase space ( i.e. to have equal and uncorrelated uncertainties in @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , @xmath41 becomes a function of the non - orthogonality between the stable and unstable manifolds . in any case ,",
    "as long as @xmath41 is not very large , the qualitative behavior is not much changed , and although analytic results are less easy to obtain for non - zero @xmath41 , quantitative predictions can be readily produced for comparison with any experimental or numerical data .",
    "the key point for our purposes here is that for a small exponent @xmath36 , the autocorrelation function remains large for the first @xmath44 iterations of the orbit , and the local density of states has a short - time envelope @xmath45 of width scaling as @xmath36 and height scaling as @xmath46 [ also see fig .",
    "[ figslin ] below ] .",
    "nonlinear recurrences on time scales beyond the mixing time ( associated with orbits homoclinic to the original periodic orbit ) lead to fluctuations multiplying this spectral envelope , eventually producing a line spectrum @xmath47 the line heights @xmath48 are distributed in each energy region as a chi - squared distribution with mean @xmath49 @xcite : @xmath50 thus , the distribution of decay widths can be strongly energy - dependent ; in particular , the probability to remain in the system at long times is now given by @xmath51 if initially only states with energy around @xmath52 are populated .    the scarred states ( those with energy close to satisfying the ebk quantization condition ) have @xmath53 and thus decay much faster than the antiscarred states  @xcite , which are far from satisfying ebk and thus have @xmath54 .",
    "let us examine more closely these two distinct energy regimes .",
    "near the quantization energy @xmath55 , the smoothed density of states @xmath49 has its peak ; its height scales inversely with @xmath36 for small @xmath36  @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a numerical constant  @xcite .",
    "the width is a dimensionless quasienergy that takes values in the interval @xmath58 $ ] . for a real continuous - time system with a periodic orbit of period @xmath59 ,",
    "it is of course the quantity @xmath60 that must be compared with the dimensionless number @xmath36 .",
    "also , the smoothed density of states will then have an infinite sequence of peaks , each centered on an energy satisfying the ebk quantization condition@xcite .",
    "the ratio of each peak width to the spacing between peaks scales as @xmath36 .",
    "] of this peak in @xmath49 scales linearly with @xmath36 for small @xmath36 , and all of the anomalously enhanced wavefunction intensities come from this energy region , as was observed and confirmed numerically in @xcite . in the open system",
    ", these states produce an excess of large resonance decay widths and decay faster ( by a factor of @xmath44 ) than would be predicted by rmt .",
    "because our focus here is on the long - time behavior of weakly open systems , we are more interested in the ( complementary ) suppression of the smoothed local density of states far from the resonance energy .",
    "again , we consider the strong scarring regime , where @xmath61 : then the linear spectrum falls off exponentially far away from the peak , @xmath62 for @xmath63 . within @xmath64 of the optimal anti - scarring energy , @xmath65 , the spectrum deviates from the exponential law and smoothly approaches the value @xmath66 at the minimum .",
    "the region within @xmath64 of @xmath65 is thus responsible for producing the smallest wavefunction intensities , and the narrowest resonances in the corresponding open system .",
    "this excess of exponentially small decay rates is as dramatic a signature of the underlying classical behavior as the long wavefunction intensity tails found in @xcite . as we will observe in the next section ,",
    "the antiscarring effect on the long - time behavior of open systems can be very striking even for moderate exponents @xmath36 ( e.g. @xmath67 ) , as long as the lead is optimally placed with respect to the periodic orbit .",
    "smoothed local densities of states @xmath49 on periodic orbits of instability exponents @xmath68 ( solid curve ) and @xmath69 ( dashed curve ) are shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ figslin ] .",
    "the figure can be viewed as representing the average wavefunction intensity in a closed system as a function of energy , or the mean resonance width ( in units of @xmath28 ) at that energy in the weakly open system .",
    "the phase @xmath70 has been chosen so as to make @xmath71 the ebk energy at which maximum scarring occurs ( eq .  [ maxs ] ) .",
    "a half - log scale is used to emphasize the exponential falloff in average resonance width between @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( eq .  [ inters ] ) , and the minimum near the anti - ebk energy @xmath72 ( eq .  [ mins ] ) . for reference , the smoothed local density of states in rmt ( applicable when the lead is not in the vicinity of any short periodic orbit ) is displayed as a dotted line in the figure .",
    "we now consider the energy - averaged probability to remain in the open system : this will be the quantity studied in detail numerically in the next section , where the model system is a ( non - energy conserving ) discrete - time kicked map .",
    "[ for an energy - conserving system , varying the strength of a weak magnetic field and thus sweeping through different values of the phase @xmath73 would produce the same result .",
    "] again , because the perturbation induced by opening up the system is small , there is little mixing among states of different energy .",
    "thus the total probability to remain is obtained simply by averaging the probabilities at the different energies . from eq .",
    "[ preme ] we see that at short times , the classical behavior is recovered : @xmath74 as @xmath75 by normalization .",
    "thus at short times , @xmath20 , the faster - decaying scarred states and slower - decaying antiscarred states always cancel exactly and no sign of the quantum signatures of the underlying classical dynamics can be observed . on the other hand , at long times , i.e. for @xmath76^{-1}$ ]",
    ", we obtain the very different behavior @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the energy at which the smoothed spectrum has its minimum ; for an optimally placed lead @xmath9 this energy is exactly @xmath79 out of phase with the ebk energy @xmath73 , as discussed above ( eq .  [ mins ] ) .",
    "@xmath80 is the inverse of the smoothed density of states at @xmath9 , averaged over energy ( or weak magnetic field ) .",
    "as @xmath81 by definition , any fluctuations in the smoothed spectrum resulting from short - time recurrences will cause @xmath80 to be greater than one , resulting in an enhanced probability to remain at long times .",
    "in particular , for an optimally placed lead ( corresponding to eq .  [ alin ] ) , let us consider the strong scarring regime of small @xmath36 .",
    "this gives the exponentially large enhancement @xmath82 this long - time behavior is completely dominated by the most antiscarred states , i.e. those with energy within @xmath64 of @xmath83 ( eq .  [ mins ] ) . for a non - optimally placed lead , with not too large non - optimality parameter @xmath41 ( see eq .",
    "[ alingen ] and discussion following ) we find empirically a similar exponential enhancement of the typical decay time : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a numerical constant .",
    "if the state @xmath9 defining the phase - space location of the opening is centered off of the periodic orbit , but within @xmath4 of the orbit , one still has fluctuations in the linear density of states and consequently an enhancement in the probability to remain at long times .",
    "an analytic form for the linear autocorrelation function in such a case can be found in@xcite . for a circular minimum - uncertainty phase - space opening centered a distance @xmath86 away from a periodic orbit with small exponent @xmath36 , the energy - averaged value @xmath80 scales as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is yet another numerical constant .",
    "@xmath86 can be a displacement along either the stable or unstable direction away from the orbit .",
    "thus , deviations from rmt behavior are observed in an area scaling as @xmath4 surrounding the periodic orbit .",
    "maximum enhancement of @xmath89 ( i.e. enhancement of order @xmath90 ) occurs for @xmath91 , corresponding to a phase - space area scaling as @xmath92 surrounding the orbit .",
    "if we consider the long - time probability to remain in the system _ averaged over all possible positions of the lead _ , we obtain @xmath93 [ the correction to rmt is obtained by multiplying the maximum obtainable enhancement by the size of the phase - space region where such enhancement occurs . ] in principle , contributions from all the periodic orbits need to be added , however , if orbits with small @xmath36 exist , they will clearly dominate any such sum .",
    "the result is that at finite energy , exponentially large ( in @xmath94 ) deviations from rmt are found even in the phase - space averaged analysis . in the @xmath95 limit of any given classical system ,",
    "the rmt behavior is recovered because the chance of a lead being found on the short periodic orbit goes to zero .    in section  [ numprob ] , we present theoretical predictions and numerical data measuring the probability to remain in the system at long times as a function of the location of the opening .      up until now",
    "we have been focusing on the distribution of resonance widths and on the _ total _ probability to remain in the system starting from a _ uniform _ initial state , all as a function of the location of the lead @xmath9 . in other words , while changing the location of the opening , we have always been tracing over the initial and final states of the system .",
    "we now proceed to address two related questions , both of which require us to consider transport properties and wavefunction intensity correlations within the system .    first , still taking the initial filling to be uniform , and fixing the location of the opening to be on a periodic orbit , it is natural to ask how the long - time probability density remaining in the system distributes itself over phase space .",
    "classically , we expect the remaining probability always to be redistributing itself on a time scale short compared to the decay time , and thus to be uniform except in a very narrow corridor encompassing the unstable orbit .",
    "the width of the corridor scales as the size of the opening . in rmt , of course , the remaining probability is also completely uniform except at phase space locations having non - zero overlap with @xmath9 . in contrast , we find that in the real quantum system , the remaining probability density is strongly suppressed in a corridor of size @xmath4 around the orbit , much wider than the size of the lead .",
    "even more interesting is the fact that the probability density can be either relatively enhanced or suppressed along the _ other _ unstable orbits of the system , depending on the classical actions associated with these orbits .    before proceeding , we mention a closely related problem , which can be thought of as a time - reversed version of the one stated above . instead of initially filling the system with a uniform density , we inject probability in some known initial state and look at the probability to remain after a long time as a function of this initial state .",
    "this state , which we call @xmath96 , should be classically well - defined , i.e. it can be a phase - space gaussian , or a position or momentum state , as discussed above .",
    "the two problems are in general distinct : if @xmath97 is the non - hermitian quantum hamiltonian , the first involves the quantity @xmath98 , while the second measures @xmath99 .",
    "however , when @xmath10 is very small ( in the regime of non - overlapping resonances ) , @xmath97 is nearly normal , the distinction between left and right eigenstates vanishes , and the two quantities both converge to the eigenstate sum @xmath100 for @xmath96 not on the periodic orbit containing the lead @xmath9 , the quantity @xmath101 is independent of @xmath102 , and follows its own chi - squared distribution with mean scaling as @xmath103 . here",
    "@xmath103 is the fourier transform of the linearized ( short - time ) autocorrelation function of the test state @xmath96 ; it is to be distinguished from @xmath104 , the smoothed local density of states _ at the lead_. we easily obtain , at energy @xmath52 , @xmath105    averaging over @xmath52 , we obtain the ratio of the remaining probability density at @xmath96 to the average remaining density at long times : @xmath106 we see that this ratio goes to unity if @xmath107 has no energy dependence , i.e. if @xmath96 does not lie on a short periodic orbit . if the position @xmath9 of the lead itself does not lie on a periodic orbit , the remaining density profile will of course be flat over _ all _ states @xmath96 .",
    "however , if both @xmath9 and @xmath96 lie on periodic orbits , the probability to be found at @xmath96 can be either suppressed or enhanced , depending on whether the energy envelopes @xmath108 and @xmath107 are in or out of phase in the energy range being averaged over . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider an example where the periods , and instability exponents of the two orbits are equal .",
    "then the two smoothed energy envelopes are identical , up to a relative phase shift ( the difference between @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) , which can be adjusted by varying a magnetic flux enclosed by one of the orbits . if the two are exactly in phase , @xmath111 , then the ratio in eq .",
    "[ ratio ] reduces to @xmath112 , which , we recall from our previous discussion , is a quantity exponentially small in the instability exponent @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the remaining probability very strongly avoids the orbit on which @xmath96 is located .",
    "another way of expressing this result is that the total probability to remain in the system at long times is exponentially suppressed if the initial state is located on an orbit which is  in phase \" with the orbit on which the opening is located .    the suppression of probability density given by eq",
    ".  [ ratio ] is of course a pure quantum interference phenomenon ; it has no analogue in the classical dynamics of open systems .",
    "it is also fundamentally a long - time effect as there is in general no short path leading from @xmath9 to @xmath96 which could give rise to such intensity correlations .",
    "however , despite being intrinsically long - time and quantum , the phenomenon can be understood only in terms of the _ short - time , classical _ dynamics near each of the two unstable periodic orbits .",
    "this demonstrates once again the power of semiclassical techniques for understanding long - time quantum behavior .    in the opposite extreme case , where the two orbits are out of phase exactly by @xmath79 [ @xmath113 , the ratio in eq .",
    "[ ratio ] is dominated by the region of the envelope where @xmath114 is maximized and @xmath115 minimized .",
    "[ this is an energy region in which the wavefunctions tend to be scarred near @xmath96 and antiscarred near @xmath9 . ]",
    "the relative intensity enhancement at @xmath96 then scales with the height of the peak in @xmath107 , i.e. as @xmath116 .",
    "so a large enhancement of the remaining probability is found on orbits out of phase with the one on which the opening is located .",
    "we need to consider also the case where states @xmath9 and @xmath96 are found on the same orbit [ the same reasoning applies if @xmath9 and @xmath96 are on distinct orbits that are related by a symmetry transformation ] .",
    "this corresponds to measuring the remaining probability along the orbit on which the lead is located ( or alternatively to launching the initial probability along this orbit ) .",
    "first , consider the case where @xmath9 and @xmath96 are exactly related by time evolution in the closed system .",
    "then the two local densities of states are identical , i.e. @xmath117 for each @xmath118 .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "[ premb ] that @xmath119 in this case decays at long times as @xmath120 instead of the usual @xmath121 behavior .",
    "this is easy to understand intuitively : the very long - lived resonances which survive at long times have very little amplitude at @xmath96 .",
    "more generally , let us consider @xmath11 and @xmath96 lying on the same orbit but not exact time - iterates of one another .",
    "this is possible even if @xmath11 and @xmath96 are both optimal ( in the sense of having @xmath122 , see eq .",
    "[ alingen ] ) .",
    "thus , the iterates of @xmath11 may have width @xmath123 along the unstable manifold as they pass through that point on the orbit on which @xmath96 is centered  @xcite .",
    "if we choose a width for @xmath96 which does not correspond to any integer @xmath118 , then @xmath96 is not any exact time - iterate of @xmath9 .",
    "however , for some time @xmath33 we may still write @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "then the local density of states at @xmath96 separates naturally into two parts : one of weight @xmath126 which is exactly equal to the density of states at the opening @xmath9 , and another of weight @xmath127 which is statistically independent of the former but has the same linear energy envelope .",
    "the first , as we just saw , gives a contribution to @xmath128 which scales as @xmath120 and thus can be ignored at long times .",
    "the second behaves just as if @xmath96 were located on a different orbit having the same linear envelope .",
    "thus for @xmath11 and @xmath96 on the same orbit we obtain the same exponential suppression factor as before ( eq .  [ ratio ] ) , times the extra suppression factor @xmath127 .",
    "this latter factor also becomes very small for small @xmath36 @xcite , as any wavepacket optimally placed on a periodic orbit comes ever closer to being an exact time - iterate of any other such wavepacket on the same orbit .",
    "we note again that this effect is purely quantum - mechanical , based though it is on short - time semiclassical analysis .",
    "classically , only a tiny fraction of the probability distribution corresponding to @xmath96 would leak out through the hole at @xmath11 before the density escapes from the periodic orbit and proceeds to distribute itself evenly over the entire accessible phase space .",
    "we now proceed to test numerically the various results obtained analytically in the previous section .",

    "if the classical system contained several not very unstable orbits ( see next subsection for an example ) , several bright spots would appear in the plot , and each could then be well reproduced using the linearized classical dynamics around the appropriate orbit .",

    "the theoretical prediction @xmath80 is shown as a solid curve .",
    "the data consistently falls below the theoretical prediction , with the disagreement becoming more pronounced at the smaller values of @xmath36 .",
    "the reason is primarily a finite - size effect : the analytical calculations are all carried out under the assumption that the mean level spacing is much smaller than any scale over which the linear energy envelope changes significantly .",
    "then the linear envelope is roughly constant on the scale at which individual resonances emerge , and their behavior can be treated statistically .",
    "thus , the discrepancy becomes more noticeable as @xmath198 for fixed @xmath6 , as the structures in @xmath199 become more comparable to the mean level spacing .",

    "we observe the exponential increase in the enhancement factor as @xmath36 decreases ; indeed the very moderate exponent @xmath201 produces an enhancement factor of well over @xmath202 in the long - time probability to remain .",

    "we now consider predictions concerning the enhancement or suppression of the long - time probability near orbits _ other _ than the one on which the lead is located [ see discussion in section  [ dens ] ] . to test these predictions",
    "we need an ensemble of systems all having two periodic orbits in common , and the ability to vary the action phase difference between them . in our example",
    "the two orbits have the same local dynamics in their respective neighborhoods , though this of course is not necessary to produce the desired effect .",
    "we work on the phase space @xmath207 \\times [ -1/2,1/2]$ ] , set @xmath208 in the equations of motion ( eq .  [ clasdyn ] ) , and impose the constraint @xmath209 on the kick potential ( see eq .",
    "this condition ensures the presence of a fixed point at ( 1/2,0 ) in addition to the usual one at ( 0,0 ) on which we have been focusing so far .",

    "other orbits are of course present , but they change with the coefficients @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and so their effects are expected to cancel out in the process of ensemble averaging . in order for the two orbits not to be related by a symmetry transformation we only need all the @xmath160 to be nonvanishing .",
    "our analysis showed that the behavior of the remaining probability density at long times should depend strongly on the relative action phase difference between the two orbits .",
    "this phase difference can be easily controlled by adjusting @xmath212 ( @xmath213 ) .",

    "we obtain then , for @xmath219 and @xmath172 , the results shown in fig .",
    "[ figrem]a .",
    "clearly the remaining probability is very strongly suppressed on the orbit on the left , where the lead is located [ as we saw in the previous ection , the probability to remain _ exactly _ on the orbit falls off faster with time than probability elsewhere , so the numerical value of the relative suppression there will be time - dependent ] .",
    "we also see mild density suppression on the two orthogonal invariant manifolds of this orbit . the phenomenon we want to focus on here , though , is the suppression we observe on the orbit on the right side of fig .",
    "[ figrem]a .",
    "the observed suppression factor right on the periodic orbit at @xmath220 is @xmath221 , compared with the predicted value @xmath222 ; again the discrepancy may possibly be attributed to finite size effects .",
    "as expected , we also observe probability suppression along the manifolds of this second orbit .",
    "we now consider the opposite case , where the two orbits are exactly out of phase ( @xmath223 ) .",
    "adjusting @xmath212 appropriately , we again perform ensemble averaging over the other parameters and obtain the results in fig .",
    "[ figrem]b . the same suppression is still seen along the orbit containing the lead and its invariant manifolds .",
    "however , we now see , as expected , an _ enhancement _ of the remaining probability density near the orbit on the right .",
    "the enhancement factor on that orbit itself is @xmath224 ; the theoretical prediction is @xmath225 .",
    "the predicted relative intensity at the orbit @xmath220 ( eq .  [ ratio ] ) given a lead at @xmath169 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2po ] as a function of the action phase difference between the two orbits .",
    "[ one could imagine obtaining such a plot in a physical system by tuning a weak magnetic field which had little effect on the classical dynamics but did change the relative phase between two orbits enclosing different amounts of flux .",
    "alternatively , if the periods of the two orbits differed , the orbits could be observed to go in and out of phase with one another as one changed the energy range in which the resonances were populated . ] the suppression and enhancement factors in this case never get very far from unity , due to the relatively large value of the instability exponent @xmath36 chosen for our example .",
    "values obtained numerically , as described in the preceding paragraphs , are given for comparison , along with statistical error bars .",
    "the dashed line at @xmath226 represents the rmt prediction .",
    "we have concentrated throughout on leakage through a single decay channel which is very well localized in phase space ( leak area much less than @xmath227 ) .",
    "one would like to understand more generally possible non - rmt effects for multi - channel leads as well as for leads wide enough to produce overlapping resonances .",
    "a detailed treatment of such effects is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "however , one possible extension turns out to be relatively straightforward , and the results suggest that the most interesting scar effects are already captured in the single channel analysis",
    ". specifically , consider @xmath23 decay channels , each with a slow decay rate , as in eq .",
    "[ hmany ] .",
    "if the sum of these classical rates is small compared to the level spacing , the resulting resonances will be non - overlapping , and a perturbative approach to the problem is valid . in rmt ,",
    "the probability to remain at long times is given by a product of factors associated with each of the leads ( eq .  [ pmany ] ) .",
    "in the case where one of the channels happens to be close to a short periodic orbit , the intensity distribution giving rise to the corresponding factor only will be affected , producing the same overall enhancement factor @xmath80 obtained previously .",
    "the total probability @xmath119 now falls off much more quickly with time than in the single - channel case , reflecting the fact that it is much harder to find a resonance which is slowly decaying through _ all _ of the channels .",
    "however , the essential observation of an enhanced probability of finding very narrow resonances survives . clearly the analysis is more complicated for correlated decay channels , and for the case of larger total decay rates where the resonances become overlapping .",
    "still , periodic orbits by their very nature produce quantum effects in phase space regions of size @xmath4 surrounding the orbit ; thus our intuition tells us that no fundamentally new scar effects are expected in most cases for multi - channel leads .",
    "we have seen that an analysis of short time classical motion in a chaotic system can shed much light on quantum behavior on the scale of the decay time , which is much larger than the heisenberg time and every other time scale in the system .",
    "this is somewhat counterintuitive , as the narrow resonance regime is by its very nature non - classical and is associated with the very long - time behavior of the system . even though in some cases ( e.g. in the presence of strong diffraction or caustics ) semiclassical methods may not be sufficient to predict the properties of individual high - energy quantum chaotic wavefunctions , they are still very powerful for making statistical predictions of the sort described in this paper .",
    "we note that a small change in the system potential , or the presence of a few impurity scatterers may completely change the character of individual resonances in an open system , making comparison with exact semiclassical wavefunctions futile . on the other hand , the scar theory predictions , which concern statistical properties such as the distribution of resonance widths , are robust to such changes in the details of the system , as long as the dynamics of the first few bounces is known . in a situation",
    "where the classical dynamics of the quantum system under study is not known reliably even for short times , one could use methods similar to those described here to search for the short unstable periodic orbits .",
    "this can be done by moving the position of the lead , or , more practically in many situations , by adjusting some system parameter which changes the classical dynamics of the system . for a given classical system and lead position",
    ", one then sweeps through a weak magnetic field or some other parameter not affecting the classical dynamics , and searches for a large fraction of very narrow resonances , occurring periodically in the magnetic field strength .",
    "clearly the ideas described here can also be extended to study two - lead systems , where properties such as conductance peak height distributions can be analyzed . in analogy with the present work",
    ", the results will strongly depend on whether one or both of the leads is located on a short unstable classical orbit . where the leads are found on two different short periodic orbits , the phase difference between them can be varied to produce an enhancement or suppression of the average conductance , as suggested by the results of the present work .",
    "even stronger effects can be observed if the leads are located on the same periodic orbit , or if the two orbits are related to each other by a symmetry of the system .",
    "these issues and other related questions are addressed fully in a forthcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "certainly much more work needs to be done generally in understanding classical dynamics effects on the quantum properties of open chaotic systems .",
