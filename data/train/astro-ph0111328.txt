    "describing the large - scale structure of the universe is of fundamental importance for testing theories of structure formation and measuring the cosmological parameters . the angular distribution of galaxies , whilst merely a projection of the true 3d structure , is useful to quantify : it is easy to assemble a large sample of objects and it is possible to de - project the angular clustering ( in a global statistical manner ) to measure the 3d clustering .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) detected at radio wavelengths are a powerful means of delineating large - scale structure .",
    "they can be routinely detected over wide areas of the sky out to very large redshifts ( @xmath5 ) and hence describe the largest structures ( and their evolution ) ; radio emission is not sensitive to dust obscuration ; accurate large - scale calibration should be possible ; and the current generation of radio surveys such as wenss , first and nvss contain agn in very large numbers ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we quantify the angular distribution of agn using the two - point angular correlation function @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that this method loses much of the clustering information : two very different structure morphologies can have the same correlation function .",
    "however , the statistic provides a simple point of contact with prediction , the statistical errors are well - understood , it has a relatively simple de - projection into 3d , and perhaps most importantly , its measurement can reveal observational problems with the survey data .",
    "it is an essential first analysis step before the application of more powerful techniques is warranted .    the key difference between angular correlation function analyses in the optical ( e.g. maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1996 ) and the radio regimes is in the latter , _ the wide redshift range of radio sources washes out much of the clustering signal through the superposition of unrelated redshift slices .",
    "_ hence an angular clustering signal was only marginally detected in datasets such as the 1.4 ghz green bank survey ( kooiman , burns & klypin 1995 ) and the parkes - mit - nrao survey ( loan , wall & lahav 1997 ) .",
    "deeper radio surveys such as first ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ) and wenss @xcite revealed a clearer imprint of structure , quantified by the correlation function analyses of cress et al . and magliocchetti et al . .",
    "here we use the more extensive sky coverage and source list of the nvss @xcite to test the robustness of previous conclusions with a higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we also reconsider the two critical observational effects : radio galaxies being resolved into separate components of radio emission , and calibration problems causing apparent source surface density gradients and discontinuities .",
    "the _ angular correlation function _ @xmath0 compares the observed ( clustered ) distribution to a random ( unclustered ) distribution of points across the same survey area , by simply measuring the fractional increase in the number of close pairs separated by angle @xmath7 .",
    "specifically , if we let @xmath8 be the number of unique pairs of galaxies with separations @xmath9 , and @xmath10 be the number of random pairs in the same separation range , then @xmath0 can be estimated as @xmath11 landy & szalay point out that the estimator @xmath12 which also involves the cross - pair count @xmath13 , is superior because it has a much smaller variance , given by the ` poisson ' error @xmath14 assuming the statistical error in the random sets can be neglected .",
    "this can be achieved by averaging over a large number of random sets to obtain @xmath15 and @xmath16 .      the 1.4 ghz nvss ( nrao vla sky survey , condon et al .",
    "1998 ) covers the sky north of declination @xmath17 ( 82 per cent of the celestial sphere ) .",
    "the source catalogue contains @xmath18 sources and is claimed to be 99 per cent complete at integrated flux density @xmath19 mjy .",
    "the survey was performed with the vla in d configuration , with dnc configuration used for fields at high zenith angles ( @xmath20 ) , and the fwhm of the synthesized beam is 45 arcsec .",
    "the raw fitted source parameters are processed by a publicly - available program nvsslist , which performs the deconvolution and corrects for known biases to produce source diameters and integrated flux densities .",
    "we used nvsslist version 2.16 for our analysis .    before measuring the angular correlation function from the survey",
    ", we must mask out various regions of the sky ; identical masks must be used in the random comparison catalogues .",
    "firstly , we masked the survey within @xmath21 of the galactic plane to eliminate galactic sources ( such as supernova remnants ) .",
    "secondly , by virtue of the fitting algorithm , nearby bright extended radio galaxies can appear in the nvss as a large number of separate elliptical gaussians .",
    "these objects introduce a very large number of spurious close pairs . by visual inspection of the survey , we compiled a list of 22 masks around such galaxies . finally , the sidelobes of very bright sources may appear as spurious entries in the source catalogue . as a precautionary measure , we placed circular masks of radius @xmath22 around all radio sources brighter than 1 jy ( although ultimately this was found to have no effect on the measurement ) .",
    "the nvss suffers from calibration problems at low flux densities : spurious systematic fluctuations in source surface density .",
    "as illustrated by figure [ figsurf ] , declination - dependent variations occur at flux densities below 10 mjy , including significant jumps at the declinations at which the array configuration changes .",
    "these stem from the difficulty in compensating for the sparse _",
    "uv-_coverage of the nvss ( w.cotton , private communication , 2001 )",
    ".    a varying source density will spuriously enhance the measured value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the number of close pairs of galaxies depends on the local surface density ( @xmath23 ) , but the number of close pairs in the random distribution depends on the global average surface density ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "systematic fluctuations mean @xmath25 , so according to equation [ eqw1 ] , @xmath0 is increased .    to quantify this effect , we can show ( blake & wall , in preparation ) that _ on angular scales less than those on which @xmath26 is varying _ ,",
    "@xmath0 is subject to a constant offset @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the surface over - density . to estimate the magnitude of the offset ,",
    "take a simple toy model in which a survey is divided into two equal areas between which there is an @xmath29 per cent shift in density .",
    "a simple calculation shows @xmath30 .",
    "so @xmath31 for nvss sources above 2 mjy ( @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 above 10 mjy ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the complex morphologies of radio sources mean that a single galaxy can be resolved in a radio survey as two or more closely - separated components of radio emission .",
    "the median angular size of mjy radio sources is several arcseconds ( oort 1988 ) .",
    "thus nvss , with its beam - size of 45 arcsec , will leave the majority of this population unresolved .",
    "however , there is a significant tail to the size distribution : many arcminute - size radio sources have been discovered ( e.g. lara et al . 2001 ) whose sub - structure will be resolved by nvss .",
    "these multiple components will produce spurious clustering at small separations .",
    "consider a single radio source in the survey .",
    "how many pair separations would this contribute to a separation bin at angular distance @xmath7 of width @xmath35 ?",
    "this bin contains area @xmath36 and hence the probability of another source falling in it is @xmath37 $ ] where @xmath38 is the surface density of galaxies and @xmath39 is the galaxy angular correlation function .",
    "suppose another source does fall in the bin . in general , both sources will be observed as a group of radio components : a single pair separation is replaced by several pair separations",
    ". some of these pair separations will lie _ within an individual source _ , the rest will be _ between the different",
    "sources_.    suppose @xmath7 is large enough that there are no pair separations of size @xmath7 within individual sources .",
    "if there are on average @xmath40 radio components per source , then there will be on average @xmath41 pair separations between these sources .",
    "as the radio components will be roughly symmetrically distributed about their host galaxy , the average pair separation between the components remains equal to that of the original pair of sources , @xmath7 .",
    "it follows that the expected number of radio component pairs involving our original source in this separation bin is @xmath37 \\times ( \\overline{n})^2 $ ] .",
    "hence over the whole survey , the expected number of radio component pairs in this bin is ( neglecting edge effects ) @xmath42 \\ , ( \\overline{n})^2\\ ] ] where we have divided by 2 because all pairs are counted twice .",
    "if @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the total number and surface density of radio components , then @xmath45 and @xmath46 and this may be written @xmath47\\ ] ] generating a random set containing @xmath43 components , the number of random pairs in this bin is @xmath48 and hence the measured correlation function from the radio components ( using equation [ eqw1 ] ) is simply @xmath49 . so _",
    "multiple radio components have no effect on the measured correlation function at angular separations bigger than individual sources .",
    "_    at what separation @xmath7 may we neglect the effect of radio sources of size @xmath7 ?",
    "the problem may be clarified by a realistic example .",
    "consider a separation bin at @xmath50 arcmin = @xmath51 of width @xmath52 .",
    "putting @xmath53 deg@xmath54 , there are @xmath55 random pairs _ per original source _ in this bin .",
    "but we are trying to measure @xmath0 , which is a fractional enhancement @xmath56 of this number of random pairs , which is @xmath57 pairs per original source .",
    "observations ( e.g. lara et al .",
    "2001 ) indicate that @xmath58 in @xmath59 radio sources are as large as 3 arcmin .",
    "hence we can not neglect pair separations within individual sources .",
    "thus _ the small number of surplus pairs that determine the value of @xmath0 mean that even a tiny fraction of giant radio sources can substantially change our measurement .",
    "_    suppose @xmath7 is small enough that radio component pairs originating within individual sources are also important .",
    "if @xmath60 is the fraction of sources observed to have multiple components , and @xmath61 is the fraction of those component separations in the range @xmath9 , then the total number of extra separations in the bin is @xmath62 and hence in this separation regime , @xmath63    the angular scale on which the dominant source of nvss pairs changes from multi - component sources to individual sources is 6 arcmin ( @xmath64 ) , as evidenced by a clear break in the measured correlation function ( see figure [ figcorr ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure [ figcorr ] displays the measured @xmath0 for @xmath65 mjy .",
    "we use the landy - szalay estimator ( equation [ eqw2 ] ) with the error from equation [ eqwerr ] .",
    "a good fit to @xmath0 is a sum of two power - laws .",
    "one power - law dominates at small angles ( @xmath66 ) and is a direct indication of _ the size distribution @xmath67 of giant radio sources_. the other power - law dominates at large angles ( @xmath68 ) and describes _ the clustering between individual radio sources . _",
    "we measured @xmath0 for a variety of flux thresholds and fitted a sum of two power - laws to the results .",
    "turning first to radio galaxy clustering , we find :    * the slope of the clustering power - law does not depend on flux threshold and is consistent with @xmath69 , as found for optically - selected galaxies .",
    "our most accurate determination ( for a 10 mjy threshold ) is @xmath70 . *",
    "the clustering amplitude is also independent of flux threshold : our most accurate value is @xmath71 ( with @xmath7 in degrees ) . * below @xmath72 mjy ,",
    "the calibration problems described in section [ secsurf ] become dominant , as evidenced by a sudden increase in the @xmath73 of the best fit , as well as direct measurement of the surface density ( figure [ figsurf ] ) .",
    "to view the errors on the clustering parameters @xmath74 , in figure [ figparam ] we plot contours of constant @xmath73 in @xmath75 parameter space for flux thresholds 50 mjy , 20 mjy and 10 mjy .",
    "as the survey becomes deeper , the increasing number of sources enables us to measure the clustering parameters more accurately until the calibration problems intervene .    considering the size distribution , we find :    *",
    "the slope of the small - angle correlation function is independent of flux threshold and has the value @xmath76 . *",
    "the amplitude of the small - angle correlation function changes with flux threshold ( equivalently surface density @xmath26 ) as @xmath77 , as predicted by equation [ eqmult ] .    in table",
    "[ tabres ] we list the best - fitting amplitudes for both power - laws for the flux thresholds considered , obtained by minimizing the @xmath73 statistic . for purposes of comparison , we fix the slopes of the small - angle and large - angle power - laws at @xmath76 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "the fits are performed to angles @xmath79 arcmin @xmath80 , safely above the resolution limit of the nvss .",
    "we derive @xmath81 errors on the fitted amplitudes by varying each in turn from the best - fitting combination and finding when @xmath73 increases by 1.0 from its minimum .",
    "the reduced @xmath73 statistic of the best fit is also indicated .",
    "previous correlation function analyses of radio surveys ( cress et al .",
    "1996 , magliocchetti et al .",
    "1998 ) did not consider either the gradients in source surface density ( present in first as well as nvss , blake & wall in preparation ) or the large angular scales on which multi - component sources affect the measured @xmath0 .",
    "conclusions from these analyses must be regarded as suspect .",
    "the angular distribution of galaxies is a projection of the true 3d distribution . not knowing the individual redshifts of the nvss sources",
    ", we can not infer their full spatial distribution .",
    "however , we can infer their spatial clustering properties from their angular clustering knowing only their _ redshift distribution _",
    "@xmath82 @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising : clustering properties are global statistical measures of the sample , like the redshift distribution .    the spatial correlation function @xmath83 is usually parameterized by a power - law of slope @xmath84 and ` correlation length ' @xmath85 . to allow for redshift evolution of clustering",
    "we introduce the ` clustering index ' @xmath29 such that @xmath86 @xmath87 implies constant clustering in proper co - ordinates , @xmath88 implies constant clustering in co - moving co - ordinates , and @xmath89 represents growth of clustering under linear theory ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that a power - law @xmath83 projects on to the celestial sphere as another power - law @xmath90 , where the projection involves an integral over @xmath82 .",

    "( this differs from the correlation function slope @xmath76 by virtue of the extra power of @xmath7 in equation [ eqmult ] ) .",
    "such a steep slope is naturally produced in toy models : if radio sources have linear sizes up to a maximum @xmath94 , then the available volume for sources with angular sizes @xmath95 scales as @xmath96 .",

    "predicts a total of 62 such objects .",
    "using the nvss radio survey , we have measured the angular correlation function @xmath0 of radio galaxies with unprecedented precision .",
    "the results may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the correlation function has two contributions : that due to multiple components of the same galaxy , dominant at @xmath66 , and that due to clustering between galaxies , which dominates at larger angles .",
    "a clear break in @xmath0 is evident between these scales .",
    "2 .   the clustering part has a slope consistent with that measured for other classes of galaxy , @xmath103 .",
    "3 .   the clustering amplitude corresponds to a spatial clustering length @xmath2 h@xmath3 mpc ( under certain assumptions ) , independent of flux - density threshold .",
    "4 .   the nvss suffers from calibration problems that prevent the measurement of @xmath0 at flux densities below 10 mjy .",
    "the size distribution of arcminute radio sources is well - described by a power - law with slope @xmath104 ; @xmath105 per cent of galaxies are resolved by nvss into multiple components .",
