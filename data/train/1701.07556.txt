    "recently , mnp was found to display superconductivity with @xmath2k at pressure around 7 - 8 gpa near the border of a long - range magnetic phase @xcite . as the first mn - based superconductor",
    ", it immediately raises the question concerning its pairing mechanism @xcite . the fact that superconductivity emerges at the border of a long - range magnetic order points to the possibility of magnetic glues due to spin fluctuations @xcite as has been proposed for the cras superconductivity @xcite , but first - principles calculations in the framework of the weak - coupling bcs ( bardeen - copper - schrieffer ) theory could also yield the correct transition temperature @xmath3 based solely on the electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "the issue therefore remains controversial .",
    "moreover , we still lack a good theoretical understanding of the associated magnetic and electronic structures , possibly due to the complicated phase diagram involving multiple magnetic orders varying with pressure and temperature , as shown in figure  [ fig1](a ) @xcite .",
    "the magnetic orders in mnp have been a subject of many experimental and theoretical studies since 1960s @xcite . at ambient pressure",
    ", it has an orthorhombic structure with @xmath4 space group and the lattice constants @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite . neutron diffraction experiment has provided very precise determination of its magnetic structure and revealed a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase transition at about 292 k and a ferromagnetic to spiral phase transition at about 47 k @xcite . in the ferromagnetic phase , all spins align in parallel to the @xmath1-axis , whereas in the spiral phase , the spins rotate within the @xmath8 plane with a propagation vector @xmath9 , indicating a periodicity of about nine lattice units along the @xmath0-axis ( hereafter called spi - c ) , as shown in figure  [ fig1](c ) @xcite .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments on spin wave excitations @xcite suggest that the spiral order may originate from the competition between different types of exchange interactions , as proposed in earlier theoretical work @xcite . under pressure ,",
    "the spiral phase is first suppressed and replaced by a ferromagnetic ground state in a narrow pressure window around 1.2 gpa . above 1.5 gpa , a new anti - ferromagnetic - like order appears and is then suppressed at very high pressure ( 7 - 8 gpa ) .",
    "superconductivity emerges near the magnetic quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "plane and propagating along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "( d ) the spin structure of a candidate high pressure spi - b phase with the spins rotating in the @xmath10 plane and propagating along the @xmath1-axis.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the magnetic structure of the high pressure phase has been extensively studied using neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) @xcite , magnetic x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , and muon - spin rotation ( @xmath11sr ) @xcite , but the results remain controversial . while npd and @xmath11sr indicate that the propagation vector changes from @xmath0-axis at ambient pressure to @xmath1-axis ( spi - b ) at high pressure , xrd suggests that it remains along the @xmath0-axis but with a short periodicity . on the other hand ,",
    "the nmr results imply a helical structure at 2 gpa , but the exact magnetic structure can not be resolved .",
    "the spin structure of the candidate high pressure spi - b phase is shown in figure  [ fig1](d ) @xcite .",
    "the complicated magnetic phase diagram is probably related to the change of the lattice parameters with pressure . as shown in figure  [ fig1](b ) ,",
    "while both @xmath12 and @xmath0-axises change only slightly , the @xmath1-axis lattice parameter was found to decrease dramatically with pressure @xcite .",
    "however , the crystal symmetry remains the same without a structural phase transition .",
    "previous numerical calculations have yielded spiral phases at low and high pressures , but failed to produce the experimental * q*-vector as well as the ferromagnetic phase at intermediate pressures @xcite .",
    "moreover , the calculated energy differences between both spiral states and the ferromagnetic state are very small .",
    "more elaborate studies are needed in order to establish a systematic understanding of the variation of the magnetic orders in the experimental phase diagram .",
    "the electronic structures of mnp have also been investigated recently at ambient pressure @xcite .",
    "detailed analysis of the optical spectra in comparison with first - principles calculations suggests the existence of two different types of charge carriers with distinct lifetimes .",
    "the short lifetime carriers originate from the @xmath13-orbital , exhibit quasi - one - dimensional character due to hybridization with the p @xmath14-orbitals , and are apt to order magnetically , whereas the long lifetime carriers consist of other mn orbitals and are mainly responsible for the charge transport .",
    "it has been speculated that the interplay between these two types of carriers may be crucial if superconductivity emerges from the magnetic instability .",
    "however , it is not clear if this two - fluid property holds true at high pressures , although it is expected to be a property of the crystal structure which remains unchanged with pressure",
    ". a pressure - dependent investigation of the electronic structures is demanding .    in this work ,",
    "we study the pressure evolution of the magnetic and electronic structures of mnp using first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) with both the conventional collinear wien2k code @xcite and the non - collinear wienncm code @xcite .",
    "we derive the exchange interactions from collinear calculations and predict correctly the spiral - ferromagnetic - spiral phase transitions with pressure .",
    "the results are further compared with non - collinear calculations , which yield all three magnetic phases as a function of pressure .",
    "the * q*-vector is found to decrease with pressure for the spi - c phase until it becomes zero ( ferromagnetic ) and then increase with pressure for the high pressure spi - b phase , in good agreement with the overall trend observed in neutron experiment @xcite .",
    "we further show the coexistence of anisotropic three - dimensional ( 3d ) fermi surfaces and quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) fermi surfaces , supporting the existence of two types of charge carriers even at all pressures .",
    "the quasi-1d fermi surfaces only exist in the ferromagnetic state and become gapped in the spiral states .",
    "its interplay with the more itinerant 3d charge carriers may be the key to understand the electron pairing of the superconductivity , in resemblance of those in heavy fermion superconductors @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure calculations were carried out with the wien2k @xcite and wienncm @xcite packages using full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave and local orbital methods .",
    "we took the experimental lattice parameters under pressure as shown in figure  [ fig1](b ) but with relaxed internal coordinates @xcite . the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation ( gga )",
    "was used for the exchange - correlation functional with 1500 k - point meshes for the whole brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the muffin - tin radii are set to 2.17 a.u . for mn and 1.93 a.u . for p according to the high pressure structure .",
    "for non - collinear calculations using the wienncm code , the bloch wave function of the spiral spin structure takes the form : @xmath15 which takes into account the periodicity of both the crystal and spin structures .",
    "the computational time is therefore greatly increased compared to the collinear calculations . in either case",
    ", the spin - orbital couplings of the mn - ions are found to be irrelevant .",
    "spiral spin structure typically arises from magnetic frustration @xcite . in mnp - type compounds",
    ", it involves three major exchange interactions between neighboring mn - ions as shown in figure  [ fig2](a ) @xcite , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the inter - chain exchange interactions and @xmath18 is the intra - chain exchange interaction along the mn zigzag chain .",
    "the fourth - nearest - neighbor exchange interaction @xmath19 is found to be two orders of magnitude smaller in our calculations due to the relatively longer mn - mn distance and is therefore neglected in the discussions . the magnetic ground state is then determined by two dimensionless variables , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which gives a theoretical phase diagram in figure  [ fig2](b ) @xcite .    to determine the property of the magnetic ground",
    ", we therefore need all three exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "we consider four different magnetic structures as shown in table  [ table1 ] and use dft to calculate their respective energy @xcite .",
    "the calculations involve a 1@xmath221@xmath222 supercell in order to obtain two inter - chain exchange interactions . using the heisenberg model @xmath23",

    "the ferromagnetic state becomes the ground state when the ratio @xmath32 takes its minimum and crosses slightly over the phase boundary .",

    "we find that the energy of the spi - c state increases systematically with increasing pressure , whereas that of the spi - b state decreases with increasing pressure , possibly owing to the rapidly reduced lattice parameter along the @xmath1-axis @xcite . hence below 1.2 gpa",

    ", this corresponds to the two intersecting bands along the y - s direction .",
    "the anisotropic 3d - cylindric fermi surfaces come from other mn 3@xmath43-orbitals . as discussed previously @xcite , these special topology of the fermi surfaces give rise to two different types of charge carriers which coexist in the ferromagnetic state . in the spiral state ,",
