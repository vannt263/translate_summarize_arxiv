    "the spatial search problem is to find a marked object from an unsorted database of size @xmath4 spread over distinct locations .",
    "its characteristic is that one can proceed from any location to only its neighbours , while inspecting the objects .",
    "the problem is conventionally represented by a graph , with the vertices denoting the locations of objects and the edges labeling the connectivity of neighbours .",
    "classical algorithms for this problem are @xmath5 , since they can do no better than inspect one location after another until reaching the marked object . on the other hand , quantum algorithms can do better in search problems by working with a superposition of states , grover s algorithm being the prime example @xcite .",
    "the spatial search problem has been a focus of investigation in recent years using different quantum algorithmic techniques , both analytical and numerical , and in a variety of spatial geometries ranging from a single hypercube to regular lattices @xcite .",
    "these studies have mainly looked at the asymptotic scaling forms of the algorithms , and have not varied the database size @xmath4 and its dimension @xmath0 independently . in this work",
    ", we study the specific case of searching for a marked vertex on a @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice with @xmath6 vertices .",
    "we let @xmath4 and @xmath0 be independent , as well as determine the scaling prefactors , and thereby develop a broad picture of how the dimension of the database ( or the connectivity of the graph ) influences the spatial search problem .",
    "the quantum algorithmic strategy for spatial search is to construct a hamiltonian evolution , where the kinetic part of the hamiltonian diffuses the amplitude distribution all over the lattice and the potential part of the hamiltonian attracts the amplitude distribution toward the marked vertex @xcite .",
    "the optimization criterion for the algorithm is to concentrate the amplitude distribution toward the marked vertex as quickly as possible .",
    "grover constructed the optimal global diffusion operator , but it requires movement from any vertex to any other vertex in just one step . that corresponds to a fully connected graph , or equivalently the mean field theory limit .",
    "when movements are restricted to be local ( i.e. one can go from a vertex to only its neighbours in one step ) , the search algorithm slows down .",
    "it is then worthwhile to redesign the search algorithm by understanding the extent of slow down due to local movements , and how it depends on the spatial arrangement of the database .",
    "that is the question we address quantitatively in this article . as discussed in what follows , for the best spatial search algorithms , the slow down is in the scaling prefactor for @xmath1 and in the scaling form for @xmath7 .",
    "a diffusion process can be modeled either using continuous time and a first order time derivative , or using discrete time and a single time step evolution . in its discrete version ,",
    "it is generically described as a random walk , whereby a probability distribution evolves in a non - deterministic manner at every time step .",
    "such random walks have been used to tackle a wide range of graph theory problems , usually with a local and translationally symmetric evolution rule .",
    "we use a quantum version of this process , i.e. quantum random walks @xcite .",
    "it provides a unitary evolution of the quantum amplitude distribution , such that the amplitude at each vertex gets redistributed over itself and its neighbours at every time step .",
    "it is worth noting that quantum random walks are deterministic , unlike classical random walks , with quantum superposition allowing simultaneous exploration of multiple possibilities .",
    "several quantum algorithms have used them as important ingredients , and an introductory overview can be found in ref.@xcite .    on a periodic lattice with translational symmetry ,",
    "spatial propagation modes are characterized by their wave vectors @xmath8 .",
    "quantum diffusion depends on the energy of these modes according to @xmath9 .",
    "the lowest energy mode , @xmath10 , corresponding to a uniform distribution , is an eigenstate of the diffusion operator and does not propagate .",
    "the slowest propagating modes are the ones with the smallest nonzero @xmath11 .",
    "the commonly used diffusion operator is the laplacian , with @xmath12 .",
    "the alternative dirac operator , available in a quantum setting , provides a faster diffusion of the slowest modes with @xmath13 .",
    "its quadratically faster spread makes it better suited to quantum spatial search algorithms @xcite .",
    "an automatic consequence of the dirac operator is the appearance of an internal degree of freedom corresponding to spin , whereby the quantum state becomes a multi - component spinor .",
    "these spinor components can guide the diffusion process , and be interpreted as the states of a coin @xcite . while this is the only possibility for the continuum theory , another option is available for a lattice theory , i.e. the staggered fermion formalism @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the spinor degrees of freedom are spread in coordinate space over an elementary hypercube , instead of being in an internal space .",
    "we follow it to construct a quantum search algorithm on a hypercubic lattice , reducing the total hilbert space dimension by @xmath14 and eliminating the coin toss instruction .",
    "the free particle dirac hamiltonian in @xmath0 dimensions is @xmath15 on a hypercubic lattice , with the simplest discretization of the gradient operator , @xmath16 ~,\\ ] ] and a convenient choice of basis , the anticommuting matrices @xmath17 are spin - diagonalized to location dependent signs : @xmath18 with this choice , translational invariance holds in steps of 2 ( instead of 1 ) , and the squared hamiltonian , @xmath19 has eigenvalues @xmath20 on a hypercubic lattice .",
    "inclusion of a mass term slows down the diffusion process , but it also regulates the @xmath10 mode . in the present article , we set @xmath21 ; in an accompanying article @xcite , we investigate the advantage a nonzero mass offers when the problem has an infrared divergence .    even when the hamiltonian @xmath22 is local , the discrete time evolution operator @xmath23 may connect arbitrarily separated vertices . to make @xmath24 also local , we split @xmath22 in to block - diagonal hermitian parts and then exponentiate each part separately @xcite . for a bipartite lattice , partitioning of @xmath22 in to two parts ( which we label `` odd '' and `` even '' )",
    "is sufficient for this purpose @xcite : @xmath25 this partition is illustrated in fig.1 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "each part contains all the vertices , but only half of the links attached to each vertex .",
    "each link is associated with a term in @xmath28 providing propagation along it , and appears in only one of the two parts .",
    "@xmath22 thus gets divided in to a set of non - overlapping blocks of size @xmath29 ( each block corresponds to an elementary hypercube on the lattice ) that can be exactly exponentiated .",
    "the amplitude distribution then evolves according to @xmath30 each block of the unitary matrices @xmath31 mixes amplitudes of vertices belonging to a single elementary hypercube , and the amplitude distribution spreads in time because the two alternating matrices do not commute .",
    "note that @xmath32 does not perform evolution according to @xmath28 exactly .",
    "instead , @xmath33 . still , the truncation is such that @xmath32 is exactly unitary , i.e. @xmath34 for some @xmath35 .",
    "we adopt the convention where the walk operator @xmath32 is real . for @xmath26",

    "let the amplitude distribution in a two spinor ( or coin ) component notation be @xmath42 then the walk operator becomes @xmath43 the operator @xmath44 just mixes the components of @xmath45 within the block .",
    "the first term of the operator @xmath46 is stationary , while the other moves the amplitude to neighbouring blocks .",
    "the movement is accompanied by chirality flip , a characteristic feature of the dirac operator , because of the raising and lowering pauli operators @xmath47 .    in @xmath0 dimensions , the preceding structure generalises to @xmath48 hamiltonian blocks that can be expressed in terms of tensor products of pauli matrices @xcite .",
    "when operating on hypercubes with coordinate labels @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 when operating on a hypercube with all coordinates flipped in sign . note that eq.([hoblock ] ) is the sum of @xmath0 terms , which mutually anticommute and whose squares are proportional to identity .",
    "this is the characteristic signature of the dirac hamiltonian , eq.([diracham ] ) .",
    "the block - diagonal matrices satisfy @xmath52 , and exponentiate to @xmath53 the parameter @xmath54 can be optimised , to achieve the fastest diffusion across the lattice .",
    "note that the @xmath0-dimensional walk is not the tensor production of @xmath0 one - dimensional walks .    again separating the degrees of freedom within each local hypercube as @xmath55\\{0,-1}@xmath56 , the location dependent signs can be rewritten as operators acting on the spinor ( or coin ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the walk operator takes the form : @xmath57 , @xmath44 , and @xmath58      to search for a marked vertex , say the origin , we attract the quantum random walk toward it by adding a potential to the free hamiltonian , @xmath59 exponentiation of this potential produces a phase change for the amplitude at the marked vertex .",
    "for the steepest attraction of the quantum random walk toward the marked vertex , it is optimal to choose @xmath60 so as to make the corresponding evolution phase maximally different from @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "the sign provided by @xmath63 does not matter in this case , and the evolution phase becomes the binary oracle , @xmath64 the search algorithm alternates between diffusion and oracle operators  a discrete version of trotter s formula involving @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67yielding the evolution @xmath68^{t_2 } \\psi(\\vec{x};0,0 ) ~. \\label{evolsearch}\\ ] ] here @xmath69 is the number of search oracle queries , and @xmath70 is the number of walk steps between queries .",
    "both should be minimised to find the the quickest solution to the search problem .",
    "since this algorithm iterates a unitary operator on the initial state , it produces periodic results . as a function of the number of iterations , the probability of being at the marked vertex first increases , reaches a peak value @xmath71 after @xmath69 search oracle queries",
    ", then decreases toward zero , and thereafter keeps on repeating this cycle .",
    "grover s algorithm is designed to evolve the quantum state in a two - dimensional hilbert space ( spanned by the initial and marked states ) , and is able to reach @xmath72 .",
    "that does not hold for spatial search , and the resultant values of @xmath71 are less than @xmath61 .",
    "the remedy is to augment the algorithm by the amplitude amplification procedure @xcite , to find the marked vertex with @xmath73 probability .",
    "the complexity of the algorithm is then characterised by the effective number of search oracle queries , @xmath74 .      spatial search obeys two simple lower bounds .",
    "one arises from the fact that while the marked vertex could be anywhere on the lattice , one step of the local walk can move from any vertex to only its nearest neighbours .",
    "since the marked vertex can not be located without reaching it , the worst case scenario on a hypercubic lattice requires @xmath75 steps .",
    "this bound is the strongest in one dimension , where quantum search is unable to improve on the @xmath5 classical search .",
    "the other bound follows from the fact that spatial search can not outperform grover s optimal algorithm , and so it must require @xmath76 oracle queries .",
    "that is independent of @xmath0 , and stronger than the first bound for @xmath1 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the first bound weakens with increasing @xmath0 , as the number of neighbours of a vertex increase and steps required to go from one corner of the lattice to another decrease . in analogy with mean field theory behaviour of problems in statistical mechanics , we can thus expect that in the @xmath2 limit the locality restriction on the walk would become irrelevant and the complexity of spatial search would approach that of grover s algorithm . (",
    "note that the maximum value of @xmath0 is @xmath77 for finite @xmath4 . )",
    "our results in this work demonstrate that not only is the @xmath76 complexity scaling achievable for @xmath1 , but one can get pretty close to the asymptotic prefactor @xmath78 as well .    combined together",
    ", the two bounds make the complexity of spatial search @xmath79 .",
    "the two bounds are of the same magnitude , @xmath76 , for the critical case of @xmath27 .",
    "it is a familiar occurrence in statistical mechanics of critical phenomena that an interplay of different dynamical features produces logarithmic correction factors in critical dimensions due to infrared divergences .",
    "the same seems to be true for spatial search in @xmath27 , where algorithms are slowed down by extra logarithmic factors @xcite .",
    "it is an open question to design algorithms , perhaps using additional parameters , that suppress the logarithmic factors as much as possible .",
    "we look at the special @xmath27 case in an accompanying article .",
    "the way the lower bounds arise in spatial search also illustrates an interplay of two distinct physical principles , special relativity ( or no faster than light signaling ) and unitarity .",
    "it is well - known that the two are compatible , but just barely so , in the sense that physical theories that are unitary but not relativistic or relativistic but not unitary exist .",
    "furthermore , the best algorithms should arise in a framework that respects both the principles , i.e. relativistic quantum mechanics . in spatial search , locality of the quantum walk and the square - root speed up produced by the dirac equation ( through change in the dispersion relation )",
    "follow from special relativity . on the other hand , optimality of square - root speed up provided by grover s algorithm",
    "is a consequence of unitarity @xcite .",
    "why these two distinct physical principles lead to the same scaling constraint is not understood , and is a really interesting question to explore . at present , however , we have nothing more to add .",
    "we point out that preparation of the unbiased initial state for the search problem , i.e. the translationally invariant uniform superposition state @xmath80 , is not at all difficult using local directed walk steps .",
    "for instance , one can start at the origin , step by step transfer the amplitude to the next vertex along an axis , and achieve an amplitude @xmath81 at all the vertices on the axis after @xmath82 steps . repeating",
    "the procedure for each remaining coordinate direction produces the state @xmath83 after @xmath84 steps in total .",
    "clearly , this preparation does not add to the complexity of the algorithm .",
    "the fastest search amounts to finding the shortest unitary evolution path between the initial state @xmath83 and the marked state @xmath85 .",
    "this path is a geodesic arc on the unitary sphere from @xmath83 to @xmath85 , and grover s optimal algorithm strides along this path perfectly . in our algorithm ,",
    "eq.([evolsearch ] ) , we have replaced grover s optimal diffusion operator , @xmath86 , with the walk operator @xmath87 .",
    "so to optimise our algorithm , we need to tune the parameters appearing in @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 ) and @xmath70 , such that @xmath90 approximates a rotation in the two - dimensional @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace by the largest possible angle .",
    "the operator @xmath91 has @xmath83 as an eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath61 .",
    "all other states orthogonal to @xmath83 , in particular the combination @xmath92 in the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace , are its eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath93 .",
    "the walk operator @xmath94 also has @xmath83 as an eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath61 .",
    "however , its other eigenvalues are spread around the unit circle , and evolution under @xmath90 does not remain fully confined to the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace .",
    "if the outward diffusion is not controlled , the probability of remaining in the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace would decay exponentially with the number of iterations . to reach the marked state with a constant probability , therefore ,",
    "parameters must be tuned so that part of the outward diffusion subsequently returns to the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace .",
    "the optimisation condition that makes @xmath87 as close an approximation to @xmath91 as possible can be formulated in several different ways . though they all lead to the same result , describing them",
    "separately is instructive .",
    "\\(1 ) maximise the overlap of @xmath87 and @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath95 @xmath96 is the amplitude for the random walk to return to the starting state @xmath97 after @xmath70 time steps .",
    "since @xmath32 is translationally invariant along each coordinate direction in steps of 2 , we need to evaluate @xmath96 only for states @xmath97 in an elementary hypercube .",
    "now , any closed path on a hypercubic lattice takes an even number of steps along each coordinate direction , and all location dependent propagation signs ( cf . eq.([pmsigns ] ) ) get squared to @xmath61 in the process . as a result , @xmath96 is independent of @xmath97 , and the optimisation condition becomes the minimisation of @xmath98 .",
    "\\(2 ) make @xmath99 approximate an eigenvector of @xmath87 , with an eigenvalue approaching @xmath93 , i.e. minimise @xmath100 which happens to be the same condition as given earlier .",
    "in addition , unitarity of the evolution operator implies @xmath101    \\(3 ) maximise the rotation provided by the operator @xmath90 along the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace .",
    "this rotation is given by the projection @xmath102 = \\pmatrix { \\langle s       |w^{t_1}r|s\\rangle & \\langle s       |w^{t_1}r|s_\\perp\\rangle \\cr \\langle s_\\perp|w^{t_1}r|s\\rangle & \\langle s_\\perp|w^{t_1}r|s_\\perp\\rangle \\cr } \\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\pmatrix { 1 - { 2\\over n } & { 2\\over n}\\sqrt{n-1 }",

    "so the total projection can be viewed as first applying an iteration of grover s algorithm to the state , and then shrinking the @xmath99 component by a factor @xmath105 .",
    "the shrinking disappears and the projection tends to an exact orthogonal transformation , as @xmath106 approaches its lower bound @xmath107 .",
    "it also follows that when the shrinking is controlled , cutting down outward diffusion from the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace , the algorithm will have the same @xmath108 scaling as in case of grover s algorithm .",
    "the minimisation condition for @xmath106 is obtained here only using the translational invariance of the walk operator @xmath32 , together with @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "it is easy to perform this optimisation numerically , as a function of the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath70 , and our results are described later . before that , an understanding of the eigenspectrum of @xmath32 gives us some idea regarding what to expect .",
    "since @xmath111 , eigenvalues of @xmath112 and @xmath113 are @xmath114",
    ". moreover , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are traceless , so that half the eigenvalues are @xmath115 and the other half @xmath116 .",
    "consequently , eigenvalues of @xmath117 and @xmath118 are @xmath119 , equally divided among complex conjugate pairs .",
    "furthermore , @xmath120 and @xmath31 have the same eigenvectors .",
    "since @xmath121 and @xmath122 do not commute , we do not have a general solution for the eigenspectrum of @xmath32 .",
    "still it is straightforward to work it out in the continuum time limit , @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath28 is diagonalised by a fourier transform , @xmath124 \\nonumber\\\\    & \\longrightarrow & \\sum_{n=1}^{d } \\sin^{2}(k_{n } ) |\\vec{k}\\rangle ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a uniform distribution in the brillouin zone .",
    "up to @xmath125 , therefore , the eigenvalues of @xmath126 are @xmath127 , with the eigenphases in the interval @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "the average value of @xmath129 is @xmath130 , and the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath32 are @xmath131 .",
    "we find that this average value plays an important role in determination of the optimal parameters .",
    "the considerations of the previous subsection focused on what happens during a single iteration of the algorithm . over many iterations ,",
    "there is outward diffusion of the amplitude distribution from the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace , and subsequent partial return . that plays an important role in the overall success of the algorithm , but we have not been able to estimate it analytically . to study the performance of the whole algorithm , therefore ,",
    "we numerically tune the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath70 to ( a ) maximise the probability of reaching the marked vertex , and ( b ) minimise the number of search oracle queries required to reach that stage .",
    "the ensuing results of our optimisation of @xmath71 , @xmath69 and @xmath106 are described in what follows .",
    "we first looked at how the probability distribution evolves as a function of time during the search process .",
    "to illustrate our results , we take @xmath132 that corresponds to maximal mixing between even and odd vertices , and analyse the evolution as a function of @xmath70 and @xmath69 on a @xmath133 lattice . as displayed in fig.2 , the probability at the marked vertex undergoes a cyclic evolution pattern as a function of time @xmath69 .",
    "we observe that the evolution is essentially sinusoidal for @xmath134 , and persists for more than 30 cycles without any visible deviation .",
    "this behaviour implies that a constant fraction of the quantum state remains in the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace , and the operator @xmath90 rotates it at a uniform rate within the subspace , fully matching the exact solution of grover s algorithm .",
    "the difference among @xmath134 is that the cycle time and the peak probability vary , meaning that the fraction of the quantum state present in the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace depends on @xmath70 .    for @xmath135",
    ", we find that the evolution rapidly loses its sinusoidal nature and the peak probability plummets .",
    "the change in the pattern is so drastic that the algorithm no longer performs a reasonable search .",
    "this behaviour implies that most of the quantum state has moved out of the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace and only a negligible component is left behind .",
    "an appropriate choice of @xmath70 is thus crucial for constructing a successful search algorithm .",
    "we also show in fig.3 what the probability distribution looks like at the instance when the probability at the marked vertex attains its peak value .",
    "we note that the distribution is strongly peaked around the marked vertex in an essentially uniform background .",
    "the peak is sharper when the peak probability is larger , and it almost disappears for @xmath135 .",
    "this pattern suggests that the part of the quantum state that diffuses outside the @xmath83-@xmath85 subspace is almost featureless .",
    "= 7.58 cm    = 7.58 cm    = 7.58 cm    = 7.58 cm    combining our observations in this particular example , we find that the best results  the shortest period , the largest peak probability and the sharpest peak  clearly correspond to @xmath136 .",
    "the results improve as @xmath70 increases from @xmath61 to @xmath137 , and rapidly deteriorate thereafter .",
    "the important fact that all optimal features appear simultaneously at @xmath136 simplifies tuning of the parameters .",
    "next we scanned through values of @xmath88 , for different values of @xmath70 and in different dimensions , to determine the optimal values at which the peak probability @xmath71 at the marked vertex is the largest and the time @xmath69 required to reach it is the smallest .",
    "a typical situation , with @xmath136 on a @xmath133 lattice , is shown in fig.4 .",
    "we notice that continuous @xmath71 has a smoother behaviour than discrete @xmath138 , and maximisation of @xmath71 and minimisation of @xmath138 occur at roughly the same value of @xmath88 .",
    "so we simplify matters , and select maximisation of @xmath71 as our optimality condition .",
    "a comparison of our scans , for @xmath136 and different number of dimensions , is presented in fig.5 .",
    "we find that at fixed @xmath70 , the shape of the @xmath71 vs. @xmath88 curve is almost dimension independent , and the optimal value of @xmath88 is approximately the same for all dimensions .",
    "we also observe that for fixed @xmath88 , @xmath71 roughly scales as @xmath139 . in the staggered fermion implementation of the dirac operator , different vertices of an elementary hypercube correspond to different degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "so our observation suggests that to a large extent only the degree of freedom corresponding to the marked vertex evolves during the search , while other degrees of freedom remain spectators .",
    "moreover , the feature that the maximum value of @xmath71 approaches @xmath139 with increasing @xmath0 implies that the efficiency of our algorithm increases with @xmath0 .",
    ".results of optimal parameter determination for different @xmath70 and in different dimensions . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with the staggered fermion implementation of the dirac operator , it matters whether the marked vertices belong to the same corner of the elementary hypercube or to different corners .",
    "so we considered various hypercube locations for the marked vertices . in table",
    "v , we compare our illustrative results for two and three marked vertices with those for a single marked vertex .",
    "the values for peak probability @xmath71 and corresponding time @xmath69 were obtained with @xmath140 and @xmath136 on a @xmath141 lattice .",
    "when the marked vertices belong to the same corner of the elementary hypercube ( e.g. ( 0,32,32 ) and ( 32,32,32 ) ) , they involve the same degree of freedom . in that case",
    ", we observe that @xmath71 decreases by a factor of @xmath142 and @xmath69 decreases by a factor of @xmath143 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the marked vertices belong to different corners of the elementary hypercube ( e.g. ( 0,32,33 ) and ( 32,32,32 ) ) , they involve different degrees of freedom . in that case , we find that @xmath71 and @xmath69 are more or less the same as for the single marked vertex case .",
    "this pattern is also followed when some marked vertices are at the same corner of the elementary hypercube and some at different corners .",
    "we can infer the following equipartition rule from these observations . a fixed peak probability ( upper bounded by @xmath139 ) is available for each corner degree of freedom of the elementary hypercube .",
    "multiple marked vertices corresponding to the same degree of freedom share this peak probability equally , while different degrees of freedom evolve independently of each other .",
    "apart from this caveat , the dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath142 for our spatial search algorithm is the same as in the case of grover s algorithm , i.e. proportional to @xmath144 .",
    "we have formulated the spatial search problem using staggered fermion discretisation of the dirac operator on a hypercubic lattice in arbitrary dimension .",
    "our search strategy , eq.([evolsearch ] ) , mimics that of grover s algorithm . the locality restriction on the walk operator becomes less and less relevant as the dimensionality of the space increases , and we expect to reach the optimal scaling behaviour of grover s algorithm as @xmath2 .",
    "we have verified our theoretical expectations by numerical simulations of the algorithm for @xmath3 to @xmath145 .",
    "we clearly demonstrate the approach to the @xmath2 limit , and find that even for @xmath3 our algorithm is only @xmath146 less efficient . from a computational cost point of view , for a fixed database size @xmath4 , our best parameters are @xmath147 and the largest @xmath0 available . with the staggered fermion implementation ,",
    "our algorithm works in total hilbert space dimension @xmath4 .",
    "that is a big reduction from the total hilbert dimension @xmath148 required by the algorithms that use coin or internal degrees of freedom ( for the best @xmath149 , @xmath150 is substantial ) , and makes our exercise worthwhile ."
