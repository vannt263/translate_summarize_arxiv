    "in a heavy ion collision , the azimuthal distribution of particles with respect to the direction of impact ( reaction plane ) is not isotropic for non - central collisions .",
    "this phenomenon , referred to as collective flow , was first observed fifteen years ago at bevalac  @xcite , and more recently at the higher ags  @xcite and sps  @xcite energies .",
    "azimuthal anisotropies are very sensitive to nuclear matter properties  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to measure them accurately . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the word `` flow '' in the restricted meaning of `` azimuthal correlation between the directions of outgoing particles and the reaction plane '' . we do not consider radial flow  @xcite , which is usually measured for central collisions only",
    ".    flow measurements are done in three steps ( see @xcite for a recent review of the methods ) : first , one estimates the direction of the reaction plane event by event from the directions of the outgoing particles ; then , one measures the azimuthal distribution of particles with respect to this estimated reaction plane ; finally , one corrects this distribution for the statistical error in the reaction plane determination . in performing this analysis",
    ", one usually assumes that the only azimuthal correlations between particles result from their correlations with the reaction plane , i.e. from flow this implicit assumption is made , in particular , in the `` subevent '' method proposed by danielewicz and odyniec  @xcite in order to estimate the error in the reaction plane determination .",
    "this method is now used by most , if not all , heavy ion experiments .    however , other sources of azimuthal correlations are known , which do not depend on the orientation of the reaction plane . for instance , there are quantum correlations between identical particles , due to the ( anti)symmetry of the wave function  : this is the so - called hanbury - brown and twiss effect  @xcite , hereafter denoted by hbt ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "azimuthal correlations due to the hbt effect have been studied recently in  @xcite . in the present paper , we show that if the standard flow analysis is performed , these correlations produce a spurious flow .",
    "this effect is important when pions are used to estimated the reaction plane , which is often the case at ultrarelativistic energies , in particular for the na49 experiment at cern  @xcite .",
    "we show that when these correlations are properly subtracted , the flow observables are considerably modified at low transverse momentum .",
    "in section 2 , we recall how the fourier coefficients of the azimuthal distribution with respect to the reaction plane are extracted from the two - particle correlation function in the standard flow analysis .",
    "then , in section 3 , we apply this procedure to the measured two - particle hbt correlations , and calculate the spurious flow arising from these correlations . finally ,",
    "in section 4 , we explain how to subtract hbt correlations in the flow analysis , and perform this subtraction on the na49 data , using the hbt correlations measured by the same experiment .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "in nucleus  nucleus collisions , the determination of the reaction plane event by event allows in principle to measure the distribution of particles not only in transverse momentum @xmath0 and rapidity @xmath2 , but also in azimuth @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane . the @xmath3 distribution is conveniently characterized by its fourier coefficients  @xcite @xmath4 where the brackets denote an average value over many events . since the system is symmetric with respect to the reaction plane for spherical nuclei , @xmath5 vanishes .",
    "most of the time , because of limited statistics , @xmath6 is averaged over @xmath0 and/or @xmath2 .",
    "the average value of @xmath7 over a domain @xmath8 of the @xmath9 plane , corresponding to a detector , will be denoted by @xmath10 . in practice ,",
    "the published data are limited to the @xmath11 ( directed flow ) and @xmath12 ( elliptic flow ) coefficients .",
    "however , higher harmonics could reveal more detailed features of the @xmath3 distribution  @xcite .    since the orientation of the reaction plane",
    "is not known a priori , @xmath6 must be extracted from the azimuthal correlations between the produced particles .",
    "we introduce the two - particle distribution , which is generally written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the two - particle connected correlation function , which vanishes for independent particles .",
    "the fourier coefficients of the relative azimuthal distribution are given by @xmath15 we denote the average value of @xmath16 over @xmath17 in the domain @xmath8 by @xmath18 , and the average over both @xmath19 and @xmath17 by @xmath20 .",
    "using the decomposition ( [ defc2 ] ) , one can write @xmath16 as the sum of two terms : @xmath21 where the first term is due to flow : @xmath22 and the remaining term comes from two - particle correlations : @xmath23 in writing eq.([flo1 ] ) , we have used the fact that @xmath24 and neglected the correlation @xmath14 in the denominator .    in the standard flow analysis ,",
    "non - flow correlations are neglected  @xcite , with a few exceptions : the correlations due to momentum conservation are taken into account at intermediate energies  @xcite , and correlations between photons originating from @xmath25 decays were considered in  @xcite . the effect of non - flow correlations on flow observables is considered from a general point of view in @xcite . in the remainder of this section , we assume that @xmath26 . then , @xmath6 can be calculated simply as a function of the measured correlation @xmath16 using eq.([flo1 ] ) , as we now show .",
    "note , however , that eq.([flo1 ] ) is invariant under a global change of sign : @xmath27",
    ". hence the sign of @xmath6 can not be determined from @xmath16 .",
    "it is fixed either by physical considerations or by an independent measurement .",
    "for instance , na49 chooses the minus sign for the @xmath28 of charged pions , in order to make the @xmath28 of protons at forward rapidities come out positive  @xcite .",
    "averaging eq.([flo1 ] ) over @xmath19 and @xmath17 in the domain @xmath8 , one obtains  : @xmath29 this equation shows in particular that the average two - particle correlation @xmath20 due to flow is positive . finally , integrating ( [ flo1 ] ) over @xmath17 , and using ( [ flo2 ] ) , one obtains the expression of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath16 : @xmath30 this formula serves as a basis for the standard flow analysis .",
    "note that the actual experimental procedure is usually different : one first estimates , for a given fourier harmonic @xmath31 , the azimuth of the reaction plane ( modulo @xmath32 ) by summing over many particles .",
    "then one studies the correlation of another particle ( in order to remove autocorrelations ) with respect to the estimated reaction plane .",
    "one can then measure the coefficient @xmath6 with respect to this reaction plane if @xmath33 is a multiple of @xmath31 . in this paper",
    ", we consider only the case @xmath34 .",
    "both procedures give the same result , since they start from the same assumption ( the only azimuthal correlations are from flow ) .",
    "this equivalence was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the hbt effect yields two - particle correlations , i.e. a non - zero @xmath14 in eq.([defc2 ] ) . according to eq.([cnnonflow ] ) , this gives rise to an azimuthal correlation @xmath35 , which contributes to the total , measured correlation @xmath16 in eq.([decomposition ] ) .",
    "in particular , there will be a correlation between randomly chosen subevents when one particle of a hbt pair goes into each subevent .",
    "the contribution of hbt correlations to @xmath35 will be denoted by @xmath36 .    in the following",
    ", we shall consider only pions .",
    "since they are bosons , their correlation is positive , i.e. of the same sign as the correlation due to flow .",
    "therefore , if one applies the standard flow analysis to hbt correlations alone , i.e. if one replaces @xmath16 by @xmath36 in eq.([flo3 ] ) , they yield a spurious flow @xmath37 , which we calculate in this section .",
    "first , let us estimate its order of magnitude .",
    "the hbt effect gives a correlation of order unity between two identical pions with momenta @xmath38 and @xmath39 if @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a typical hbt radius , corresponding to the size of the interaction region .",
    "from now on , we take @xmath42 . in practice ,",
    "@xmath43  fm for a semi ",
    "peripheral pb ",
    "pb collision at 158  gev per nucleon , so that @xmath44  mev / c is much smaller than the average transverse momentum , which is close to @xmath45  mev / c : the hbt effect correlates only pairs with low relative momenta .    in particular",
    ", the azimuthal correlation due to the hbt effect is short - ranged  : it is significant only if @xmath46 .",
    "this localization in @xmath3 implies a delocalization in @xmath33 of the fourier coefficients , which are expected to be roughly constant up to @xmath47 , as will be confirmed below .    for small @xmath33 and @xmath19 in @xmath8 ,",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath48 is the fraction of particles in @xmath8 whose momentum lies in a circle of radius @xmath49 centered at @xmath38 .",
    "this fraction is of order @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are typical magnitudes of the transverse momentum and transverse mass ( @xmath53 , where @xmath31 is the mass of the particle ) , respectively , while @xmath54 is the rapidity interval covered by the detector . using eq.([flo2 ] ) , this gives a spurious flow of order @xmath55 the effect is therefore larger for the lightest particles , i.e. for pions .",
    "taking @xmath56  fm , @xmath57  mev / c and @xmath58 , one obtains @xmath59  % , which is of the same order of magnitude as the flow values measured at sps .",
    "it is therefore _ a priori _ important to take hbt correlations into account in the flow analysis .",
    "we shall now turn to a more quantitative estimate of @xmath36 . for this purpose ,",
    "we use the standard gaussian parametrization of the correlation function ( [ defc2 ] ) between two identical pions@xcite : @xmath60 one chooses a frame boosted along the collision axis in such a way that @xmath61 ( `` longitudinal comoving system '' , denoted by lcms ) . in this frame , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote the projections of @xmath65 along the collision axis , the direction of @xmath66 and the third direction , respectively .",
    "the corresponding radii @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , as well as the parameter @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , depend on @xmath66 .",
    "we neglect this dependence in the following calculation .",
    "note that the parametrization ( [ c2 ] ) is valid for central collisions , for which the pion source is azimuthally symmetric .",
    "therefore the azimuthal correlations studied in this section have nothing to do with flow .",
    "note also that we neglect coulomb correlations , which should be taken into account in a more careful study .",
    "we hope that repulsive coulomb correlations between like - sign pairs will be compensated , at least partially , by attractive correlations between opposite sign pairs .    since @xmath14 vanishes",
    "unless @xmath72 is very close to @xmath73 , we may replace @xmath74 by @xmath75 in the numerator of eq.([cnnonflow ] ) , and then integrate over @xmath72 .",
    "as we have already said , @xmath64 , @xmath63 and @xmath62 are the components of @xmath65 in the lcms , and one can equivalently integrate over @xmath64 , @xmath63 and @xmath62 . in this frame , @xmath76 and one may also replace @xmath77 by @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting formula is boost invariant and can also be used in the laboratory frame .",
    "the relative angle @xmath79 can be expressed as a function of @xmath64 and @xmath63 . if @xmath80 , then to a good approximation @xmath81 if @xmath82 , eq.([phiq ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "we assume that @xmath83 and use , instead of ( [ phiq ] ) , the following relation  : @xmath84    to calculate @xmath48 , we insert eqs.([c2 ] ) and ( [ phiq ] ) in the numerator of ( [ cnnonflow ] ) and integrate over @xmath85 . the limits on @xmath63 and @xmath62 are deduced from the limits on @xmath17 , using the following relations , valid if @xmath80  : @xmath86 since @xmath64 is independent of @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( see eq.([phiq ] ) ) , the integral over @xmath64 extends from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "note that values of @xmath63 and @xmath62 much larger than @xmath49 do not contribute to the correlation ( [ c2 ] ) , so that one can extend the integrals over @xmath63 and @xmath62 to @xmath91 as soon as the point @xmath19 lies in @xmath8 and is not too close to the boundary of @xmath92 . by too close ,",
    "we mean within an interval @xmath93  mev / c in @xmath0 or @xmath94 in @xmath2 .",
    "one then obtains after integration @xmath95 at low @xmath0 , eq.([phiq ] ) must be replaced by eq.([phi12 ] ) .",
    "then , one must do the following substitution in eq.([corr2 ] )  : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath99 .",
    "let us discuss our result ( [ corr2 ] ) .",
    "first , the correlation depends on @xmath33 only through the exponential factor , which suppresses @xmath36 in the very low @xmath0 region @xmath100 . for @xmath33",
    "smaller than @xmath101 , the correlation depends weakly on @xmath33 , as discussed above .",
    "neglecting this @xmath33 dependence , ( [ corr2 ] ) reproduces the order of magnitude ( [ orderofmagnitude ] ) . to see this , we normalize the particle distribution in @xmath8 in order to get rid of the denominator in ( [ corr2 ] ) , and the numerator @xmath102 is of order @xmath103",
    "however , eq.([corr2 ] ) is more detailed , and shows in particular that the dependence of the correlation on @xmath104 and @xmath105 follows that of the momentum distribution in the lcms ( neglecting the @xmath106 and @xmath2 dependence of hbt radii ) .",
    "this is because the correlation @xmath36 is proportional to the number of particles surrounding @xmath73 in phase space .",
    "let us now present numerical estimates for a pb ",
    "pb collision at sps .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the @xmath0 and @xmath2 dependence of the particle distribution factorize , thereby neglecting the observed variation of @xmath51 with rapidity  @xcite .",
    "the rapidity dependence of charged pions can be parametrized by  @xcite : @xmath107 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the normalized @xmath0 distribution is parametrized by @xmath110 with @xmath111  mev  @xcite .",
    "this parametrization underestimates the number of low-@xmath0 pions .",
    "the values of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath67 used in our computations , taking into account that the collisions are semi - peripheral , are respectively 4 fm , 4 fm and 5 fm  @xcite . the correlation strength",
    "@xmath70 is approximately 0.4 for pions @xcite .",
    "finally , we must define the domain @xmath8 in eq.([corr2 ] ) .",
    "it is natural to choose different rapidity windows for odd and even harmonics , because odd harmonics have opposite signs in the target and projectile rapidity region , by symmetry , and vanish at mid - rapidity ( @xmath109 ) , while even harmonics are symmetric around mid - rapidity . following the na49 collaboration  @xcite , we take @xmath112 and @xmath113  gev / c for odd @xmath33 , and @xmath114 and @xmath115  gev / c for even @xmath33 .",

    "hbt correlations , which follow the momentum distribution , also vanish if @xmath0 is much larger than the average transverse momentum .",

    "similar results were found with na49 data  @xcite .",
    "now that we have evaluated the contribution of hbt correlations to @xmath35 , we can subtract this term from the measured correlation ( left - hand side of eq.([decomposition ] ) , which will be denoted by @xmath134 in this section ) to isolate the correlation due to flow .",

    "since these analyses assume that the correlation factorizes according to eq.([flo1 ] ) , we can reconstruct the measured correlation as a function of the measured @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , @xmath137 we then perform the subtraction of hbt correlations in both the numerator and the denominator of eq.([flo3 ] ) .",
    "the integrated flow values measured by na49 are @xmath138 and @xmath139  @xcite .",
    "after subtraction of hbt correlations , the coefficients are smaller by some 20%  : @xmath140 and @xmath141 .     and elliptic flow @xmath133 of pions , integrated over @xmath142  mev / c , as a function of the rapidity , measured by na49 ( @xmath136 , dashed curves ) and after subtraction of hbt correlations ( @xmath6 , full curves ) . for clarity sake , experimental error bars are indicated for the corrected data only.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and elliptic flow @xmath133 of pions , integrated over @xmath142  mev / c , as a function of the rapidity , measured by na49 ( @xmath136 , dashed curves ) and after subtraction of hbt correlations ( @xmath6 , full curves ) . for clarity sake , experimental error bars are indicated for the corrected data only.,title=\"fig : \" ]    fig.[fig : fig2 ] displays the rapidity dependence of @xmath28 and @xmath133 at low transverse momentum , where the effect of hbt correlations is largest .",

    "one naturally expects this decrease to occur on a scale of the order of the average @xmath0 .",
    "this is what is observed for protons  @xcite .",

    ", one would need to invoke a specific phenomenon occurring at low @xmath0 .",
    "no such phenomenon is known .",
    "even though resonance ( mostly @xmath150 ) decays are known to populate the low-@xmath0 pion spectrum , they are not expected to produce any spectacular increase in the flow .",
    "hbt correlations provide this low-@xmath0 scale , since they are important down to @xmath151  mev / c .",
    "once they are subtracted , the peculiar behaviour of the pion flow at low @xmath0 disappears .",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath133 are now compatible with a variation of the type @xmath152 and @xmath153 , up to @xmath45  mev / c .",

    "this effect is present only for pions , in the @xmath9 window used to estimate the reaction plane .",
    "azimuthal correlations due to the hbt effect depend on @xmath0 and @xmath2 like the momentum distribution in the lcms , i.e. @xmath154 , and depend weakly on the order of the harmonic @xmath33 .    the pion flow observed by na49",
    "has peculiar features at low @xmath0 : the rapidity dependence of @xmath28 is irregular , and both @xmath28 and @xmath133 remain large down to values of @xmath0 much smaller than the average transverse momentum , while they should decrease with @xmath0 as @xmath0 and @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "all these features disappear once hbt correlations are properly taken into account .",
