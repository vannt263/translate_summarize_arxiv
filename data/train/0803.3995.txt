    "a causally disconnected ( spacelike separated ) pair of qubits or atoms on the same time slice can be quantum correlated and entangled .",
    "this evokes the notion of  nonlocality \" as an innate feature of quantum entanglement , the precise meaning of which is a topic of sustained interest and some controversy .",
    "when one examines the quantum entanglement across the event horizon of a black hole , the notion of  nonlocality \" acquires an additional layer of meaning , pertaining not only to quantum correlations in ordinary ( minkowski ) spacetime but also to some nontrivial ( global ) spacetime structure .",
    "when the atoms are coupled with quantum fields , the situation becomes more interesting .",
    "interaction with the quantum fields will induce decoherence of the atoms and affect the entanglement between them .",
    "it is known that the behavior of quantum entanglement is in general very different from decoherence . for the dynamics of quantum entanglement between two qubits",
    "different environmental settings could lead to very different results .",
    "( compare , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "here we add in another dimension of consideration , that arising from nontrivial global structure of spacetime such as the existence of an event horizon , as in the spacetime of a black hole ( schwarzschild ) or a uniformly accelerated detector ( uad ) .",
    "specifically , how quantum entanglement between two detectors across the event horizon , one stationary and another uniformly accelerating , would evolve in time and how causality effects including that of retarded mutual influences would play out in these processes .",
    "this is an important ingredient for the establishment of relativistic quantum information theory .    alsing and milburn @xcite considered the quantum entanglement between two detectors ( a quantum object with internal degrees of freedom ) , one is inertial ( alice ) and the other is in relativistic motion ( bob , but when in uniform acceleration , they call it rob ) . using the fidelity of the teleportation as a measure of entanglement",
    ", they claimed that the entanglement is degraded in noninertial frames due to the unruh effect @xcite . in their treatment , both detectors are made of cavities , and the qubits are constructed by using ",
    "single particle excitations of the minkowski vacuum states in each of the cavities \" of a scalar field .",
    "however , as is pointed out by schtzhold and unruh @xcite , the introduction of cavities alters the boundary conditions in the derivations of the unruh effect @xcite , and the evolution of the field modes depends on the way the cavity is accelerated .",
    "furthermore , if rob s cavity is stationary in its local frame , then there is no particle creation inside , otherwise one has to take into account the dynamical casimir effect @xcite .    without the trouble associated with the cavity ,",
    "fuentes - schuller and mann @xcite consider free field modes in minkowski space and assume the inertial alice and the accelerated rob are observers sensitive to different single modes .",
    "suppose the quantum field is in a maximally entangled state of these two modes and the uniformly accelerated rob is always in the right rindler wedge , then from the negativity of the observed reduced density matrix ( which is obtained by integrating out the mode in the left rindler wedge originally sensitive to rob at rest but undetectable when rob is accelerated ) , fuentes - schuller and mann claimed that the field state is _ always _ entangled if rob s acceleration is finite , and because of the unruh effect , the larger rob s acceleration , the smaller the entanglement between the two modes . note that",
    "the entanglement here is not between qubits or anything localized in alice or rob s hands ; it is the entanglement between the two modes spread in the whole minkowski space and observed locally by alice and rob without considering the back - reaction of the field on the detector .",
    "note also that both the fidelity in @xcite and the negativity in @xcite are independent of time .",
    "thus there is no dynamics in these two earlier results .      in this paper",
    "we will consider a more realistic model with two unruh - dewitt ( ud ) detectors ( atoms ) , which are pointlike objects with internal degrees of freedom described by harmonic oscillators , moving in a quantum field : alice is at rest and rob is in uniform acceleration .",
    "these two detectors are set to be entangled initially , while the initial state of the field is the minkowski vacuum .",
    "the model has the advantage that it encompasses the main issues of interest yet simple enough because of its linearity to yield analytical solutions over a full parameter range .",
    "for the case of a single uniformly accelerated detector in a quantum field studied previously @xcite , exact results are available in closed form . here",
    "we will apply similar techniques to study how quantum entanglement evolves between two initially entangled ud detectors interacting through the quantum field .    in our nonperturbative treatment the field will be evolving with the detectors as a combined closed system .",
    "the back - reactions from alice s inertial detector and rob s uniformly accelerated detector on the quantum field are automatically included in a self - consistent way .",
    "moreover , our covariant formulation can account for fully relativistic effects .",
    "the following effects or features are included in our consideration :    \\1 ) _ unruh effect . _ in calculating the two - point functions of the detectors one can see that the uniformly accelerated detector ( rob ) would experience vacuum fluctuations different from those seen by the inertial detector ( alice ) . it was shown in @xcite that in the markovian regime the field state which looks like the vacuum for the inertial detector behaves like a thermal state for the uniformly accelerated one .",
    "this is the unruh effect @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) _ causality and retardation of mutual influences .",
    "_ the initial information and the response from one detector to vacuum fluctuations of the field will propagate outwards and reach the other detector in finite time .",
    "but the influence on the other detector can in turn propagate back to the original one , which creates memory effects .",
    "these mutual influences should observe causality , and not propagate faster than the speed of light .",
    "they are contained in the higher order effects of quantum entanglement which can be calculated in our formulation .",
    "\\3 ) _ observer - dependence . _",
    "we learnt from the one - detector case that detectors with large acceleration have noticeable changes in time only around @xmath0 because significant time dilation will be seen by the field once @xmath1 is large enough @xcite .",
    "therefore from the viewpoint of alice and the field most of the time the detector at rob s place looks frozen . on the other hand , in rob s",
    "coordinate time alice will take infinite time to reach the event horizon , and alice also looks frozen around rob s event horizon .",
    "these may alter the evolution of physical quantities in their dependence on rob s acceleration .",
    "\\4 ) _ fiducial time .",
    "_ while there is no simultaneity over space in our relativistic model , there exists a specified time slice ( minkowski time @xmath0 ) when we define the hamiltonian and an initial state ( as a direct product of a squeezed state of two detectors and the minkowski vacuum of the field ) . at every moment of time the physical reduced density matrix ( rdm ) for the two detectors will be obtained by integrating out the degrees of freedom of the field on that same time slice .",
    "one has to be cautious about whether the rdm depends on the time slicing or not .",
    "the following key issues are addressed in this work :    \\1 ) _ disentanglement ,  sudden death \" and entanglement revival .",
    "_ yu and eberly @xcite discovered that , unlike the decoherence process , for two initially entangled qubits each placed in its own reservoir completely detached from the other , the disentanglement time can be finite , namely , quantum entanglement between these two qubits can see a sudden death .",
    "ficek and tanas @xcite as well as anastopoulos , shresta and hu @xcite studied the problem where the two qubits interact with a common electromagnetic field .",
    "the former authors while invoking the born and markov approximations find the appearance of dark periods and revivals .",
    "the latter authors treat the non - markovian behavior without these approximations and find a different behavior at short distances . in particular , for weak coupling , they obtain analytic expressions for the dynamics of entanglement at a range of spatial separation between the two qubits , which can not be obtained when the born - markov approximation is imposed .",
    "we wish to investigate in the particular setup of our model whether and how these distinct feature of  death \" and/or  revival \" manifest in the dynamics of entanglement .",
    "\\2 ) _ entanglement in different coordinates .",
    "_ following the well - known recipe , measures of entanglement such as logarithm negativity @xcite can be calculated in a new coordinate with a time slicing different from minkowski times ( _ e.g. _ rindler time ) .",
    "we will study whether those measures of entanglement in a new coordinate can be interpreted as the degree of entanglement in rob s clock ( rindler time ) .",
    "if yes , what is the difference between the entanglement dynamics in different coordinates ?",
    "3 ) _ spatial separation between two detectors .",
    "_ how does the entanglement vary with the spatial separation @xmath2 between the two qubits ? in ( 3 + 1)d ( dimension )",
    "the mutual influences on mode functions are proportional to @xmath3 so it is quite small for large @xmath2 even if the coupling is not ultraweak .",
    "still , it is of interest to see whether the mutual influences suppress or enhance quantum entanglement , as compared to those from local vacuum fluctuations at each detector .",
    "these are some interesting new issues which will be expounded in our present study .",
    "the results from our calculations show that the interaction between entangled ud detectors and the field does induce quantum disentanglement between the two detectors .",
    "we found that the disentanglement time is finite in all cases studied , namely , there is no residual entanglement at late times for two spatially separated detectors , one stationary and another uniformly accelerating , in ( 3 + 1)d minkowski space . around the moment of full disentanglement",
    "there may be some short - time revival of entanglement within a few periods of oscillations of the detectors ( equal to the inverse of their natural frequency @xmath4 ) .",
    "but there is no entanglement generated at times much longer than @xmath5 .    in the ultraweak - coupling limit ,",
    "the leading - order behavior of quantum entanglement in minkowski time is independent of rob s proper acceleration @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath6 gets sufficiently large , the disentanglement time from alice s view would be longer for a larger @xmath6 . from rob s view , however , the larger @xmath6 is the shorter the disentanglement time .",
    "finally , in the strong - coupling regime , the strong impact of vacuum fluctuations experienced locally by each detector destroys their entanglement right after the coupling is switched on .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the setup of the problem , introduce the model and describe the measure of quantum entanglement we use . in sec .",
    "iii we present our calculations in the heisenberg picture of the evolution of the operators and the two - point functions of the detectors . in sec .",

    "as the system evolves , sometimes the entanglement is stronger for larger separation , sometimes it is weaker .",
    "our results show that the disentanglement time in our model is finite in all cases considered . but how generic are these results ?",
    "our model has two ud detectors spatially separated in ( 3 + 1)d spacetime , one stationary and another uniformly accelerating and running away , without any direct interaction with each other .",
    "the presence of the event horizon for rob has the effect of curtailing the mutual influences higher than a certain order .",
    "when we focus on one single ud detector , it behaves like the qbm of a harmonic oscillator interacting with an ohmic bath provided by the ( 3 + 1)d scalar quantum field @xcite .",
    "if there exists a direct interaction between the two detectors , there will certainly be residual entanglement between them at late times , just like the late - time entanglement between each detector and the field in our model .",
    "the scalar field in our model is living in a free space .",
    "the presence of boundaries will change the result .",
    "the backreaction started from each detector when reflected by boundaries will add another memory effect to the dynamics of entanglement and affect the late - time behavior of detectors .",
    "one example is an electromagnetic field in a perfect cavity .",
    "spacetime dimension also matters .",
    "different spacetime dimensions or boundaries give different spectral density functions of the field experienced by the detectors @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xmath229d , @xmath230 the spatial separation @xmath2 implies a suppression of mutual influences by a factor @xmath231 , so the mutual influences would be negligible in the cases with large spatial separation .",
    "spatial separation also contributes to the retardation of mutual influences , and since alice is at rest and rob is in uniform acceleration , one detector s dynamics is generally out of phase from the backreaction of the other . if the two detectors are located very close to each other through the whole dynamical process , or the two detectors are separated at a distance where resonance ( @xmath232 ) is set up , the features of the disentanglement process can be different .",
    "for example , residual entanglement at late times under specific conditions in the 2ho qbm model has been reported in @xcite ; that model is equivalent to a detector theory with two ud detectors sitting at the same point in 3d space , when the ho bath is ohmic .",
    "therefore , we believe that our results in this paper are generic for two well - separated detectors or atoms without direct interaction with each other , but coupled to a common quantum field in @xmath229d , @xmath233 minkowski space without boundary . + * acknowledgement * syl wishes to thank jun - hong an for illuminating discussions , and david ostapchuk for finding a small localized mistake in the calculation reported in the first version which does not affect any claims or results reported .",
