    "near - infrared ( near - ir ) spectroscopy of early - type stars is a relatively new field .",
    "it is motivated by the desire to study early phases of massive star formation ( when the stars are deeply embedded in their parental clouds ) and to investigate young stellar populations throughout the galactic disk and at the galactic centre in particular . despite hot stars showing a steep decline in flux levels towards longer wavelengths , observations in",
    "the near - ir become highly competitive with optical region spectroscopy for regions of high extinction . in some cases",
    "near - ir observations are the only means to penetrate the dust .",
    "the most prominent example is the galactic centre , where the extinction in the @xmath0-band amounts to 3mag , compared with more than 30mag  in  @xmath1 .",
    "near - ir spectroscopy became feasible only after substantial developments in detector technology over the past 15years .",
    "systematic observational studies of ( normal ) hot stars in the near - ir are nonetheless scarce . a spectral catalogue at low resolution ( @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath53000 ) was compiled by hanson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for ob - type stars .",
    "classification spectra of early - type stars in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath0 bands can also be found in the atlases of wallace & hinkle  ( @xcite ) , meyer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and wallace et al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , intermediate - resolution spectroscopy ( @xmath2@xmath810000 ) became the standard ( fullerton & najarro  @xcite ; hanson et al .",
    ".    unguided by observations , the field attracted little interest on the theoretical side , except for an early prediction of photospheric br@xmath9 emission in b - type stars by auer & mihalas  ( @xcite ) .",
    "later , zaal et al .",
    "( @xcite ) could explain the observed emission cores of many near - ir hydrogen lines in early b - type stars via non - lte effects , though several discrepancies between models and observation remained .",
    "the systematic behaviour of near - ir hydrogen and helium lines with spectral type and luminosity were investigated on theoretical grounds by lenorzer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for o stars .",
    "finally , the most comprehensive study of near - ir spectra of ob stars and a comparison with analyses in the optical was performed by repolust et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "considerable work has also been done on the massive star population near the galactic centre . for the most part ,",
    "this comprises extreme stars like luminous blue variables and wolf - rayet stars ( e.g.  najarro et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; martins et al .",
    "however , such objects are beyond the scope of the present discussion as their line spectra are formed in the stellar wind .",
    "the challenges of near - ir line formation in hot stars can be summarised in brief .",
    "let us recall the expression for the line source function , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the departure coefficients of the lower and upper level of the transition , respectively , @xmath13 is the transition frequency , @xmath14 is the temperature and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the planck constant , the speed of light and the boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "the line source function is identical to the planck function , @xmath18 , in lte , i.e. deep in the stellar atmosphere ( @xmath11@xmath3@xmath12@xmath31 ) or in cases where the lower and upper levels are tightly coupled ( @xmath11@xmath3@xmath12 ) .",
    "spectral absorption lines experience non - lte strengthening whenever @xmath19@xmath201 ( for @xmath11@xmath21@xmath12 ) , or they are weakened in the opposite case , potentially turning into emission lines when @xmath22 exceeds the planck function in the continuum .",
    "the source function is particularly sensitive to variations in the ratio of the departure coefficients @xmath23 when @xmath24 is small , i.e. in the rayleigh - jeans tail of the energy distribution .",
    "the denominator on the right hand side of eqn .",
    "[ eqn2 ] can adopt values close to zero , amplifying effects of a varying @xmath25 considerably ( ` non - lte amplification ' ) .",
    "this can make near - ir lines in hot stars very susceptible to even small changes in the atomic data and details of the calculation .",
    "a quantitative reproduction of observed lines requires not only accurate knowledge of the plasma parameters ( temperature and particle densities ) and the radiation field in the stellar atmosphere , but also account for all relevant processes in model atoms and use of _ high - precision atomic data _  even more so than required for analyses of hot star spectra in the visual region .    ' '' ''",
    "the scope of problems with line - formation calculations in the near - ir can be exemplified with one of the brightest stars of the northern hemisphere , the a - supergiant prototype @xmath9cyg ( deneb ) .",
    "aufdenberg et al .",
    "( @xcite ) encountered problems with the simultaneous non - lte modelling of the balmer and near - ir hydrogen lines ( see fig .",
    "[ jason ] ) , concluding , ` these failures indicate that a spherically symmetric , expanding , steady state , line - blanketed , radiative equilibrium structure is not consistent with the conditions under which [  ] the higher pfund lines form .

    "looks reliable at first glance , given that 30 levels and over 400 transitions are accounted for explicitly in the non - lte modelling .",
    "moreover , the quantum - mechanical problem of the hydrogen atom can be solved analytically , such that the atomic data are of highest precision . but are they indeed",
    "?    the previous statement applies to radiative data .",
    "hydrogen is exceptional as one important source of systematic uncertainty compromising studies of most ions of the other elements is thus excluded .",
    "however , collisions by electrons introduce a third particle to the coulomb problem , such that _ ab - initio _ calculations are required to determine reliable cross - sections for collisional processes ( excitation , ionization ) . calculations of comprehensive sets of collisional data for all atomic levels of relevance in stellar atmospheres ( lines up to @xmath26@xmath2730 may be observed in supergiants , see e.g.  fig .",

    ".model atom implementations for hi[tabmod ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the absence of reliable data one has to resort to approximations .",

    "they should reproduce experimental constraints in the few cases where such are available .",

    "the comparison for transitions with higher @xmath26 , @xmath26@xmath29 shows that uncertainty estimates for some approximations may be too optimistic .",
    "the question of which data should be preferred for non - lte model atoms has to be answered by comparison with observation .",
    "przybilla & butler  ( @xcite ) constructed several hi model atoms for this task ( see table  [ tabmod ] for a selection of data used for the evaluation of collisional excitation rates ) .",
    "coverage of a wide range of plasma parameters for the tests is essential for the comparison , therefore , main sequence and supergiant stars of spectral types a , b and o were investigated .",
    "stellar parameters were adopted from earlier detailed studies of their optical spectra .",

    "a few examples from the comparison are now provided .     in vega ( a0v ) : models a , c , e and f ( dotted , dash - dot - dot - dotted , full , dashed lines ) and an lte profile ( dashed - dotted ) are compared with observation ( thick full line ) .",
    "models b and d are omitted for clarity as they are almost identical to model f. from przybilla & butler  ( @xcite ) . ]    the a0v star vega is one of the most intensely studied stars , and in most respects well described by the assumption of lte .",

    "the remaining two models , c and e , produce similar predictions , with model e providing a slightly better fit to the observation , thus it becomes the recommended model for further use .",
    "the whole comparison process was more complicated than sketched here , involving more stars and more lines of the balmer , paschen , brackett and pfund series .",
    "full details can be found in przybilla & butler  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanisms driving departures of hydrogen from detailed balance in the atmospheres of early - type stars seemed to be well understood since the seminal work of auer & mihalas  ( @xcite ) , and numerous subsequent contributions  for line formation in the ir e.g.  by zaal et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , various choices of the ( mostly approximate ) collisional data produce no significant differences in the stellar continuum or the balmer line profiles , i.e.  the features that are the starting point for quantitative analyses using model atmosphere techniques . on the other hand , the _ local _ processes that _ modify _",
    "the radiatively induced departures from lte become a dominant factor for line - formation computations in the ir .     in @xmath32ori as a function of rosseland optical depth , @xmath34 , models a through f ( dotted , dashed - dotted , dash - dot - dot - dotted , long dashed , full , dashed lines ) .",

    "the example of @xmath32ori is used to deepen the discussion .",

    "f are displayed in fig .",
    "[ departures_ir ] .",
    "the overall behaviour , i.e.  the over- and under - population of the levels of the minor ionic species and the major species hii , is governed by the radiative processes , while the differences in the collisional data lead to modulations .",
    "these are very small for the ground state and become only slightly more pronounced for the @xmath26@xmath32 level , as these are separated by comparatively large energy gaps from the rest of the term structure . only colliding particles in the high - energy tail of the maxwell distribution are able to overcome these energy differences at the temperatures in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "thus , computations of the model atmosphere structure will not be significantly influenced , as the important bound - free opacities of hydrogen vary only in a negligible way .",
    "the ir line formation will be affected , as maximum effects from variations of the collisional data are found for the levels with intermediate @xmath26 at line - formation depth .",
    "in fact , the differences in the collisional cross - sections from approximation formulae and _ ab - initio _ computations are largest for transitions among the @xmath26@xmath337 levels with @xmath40@xmath31 and 2 , and they can amount to more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the higher rydberg states show less sensitivity as they approach the limiting case of lte , which is independent of the details of individual ( de-)populating mechanisms .",
    "collisional cross - sections from _ ab - initio _ computations up to @xmath26@xmath277 are therefore sufficient to eliminate a significant source of systematic error . using the available data it turns out that the mha- ( models a , c , e ) and j72-type approximations ( models b , d , f ) give rise to basically two sets of distinct behaviour , with the former tending to dampen non - lte departures more efficiently than the latter , due to larger collisional cross - sections .",
    "such differences in the level populations are the cause for the line - profile variations as in figs .",
    "[ vega_brgamma ] and [ supergiants_hband ] .",

    "note that the lower members of the balmer , paschen and brackett series are affected by the stellar wind of this supergiant .",
