    "we study a six - dimensional ( 6d ) space - time consisting of a flat four - dimensional ( 4d ) subspace and a disk of constant curvature for the extra dimensions .",
    "furthermore , we discretise the disk in a way that  @xmath0 equidistant lattice sites are situated on the boundary and a single site in the centre of the disk  ( section  [ sec : disk - curved - disk ] ) .",
    "such star - like geometries have been proven useful in various contexts , see for example  @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate the mass spectra and profiles of 4d gravitons and fermions in this setup ( sections  [ sec : disk - graviton - spectrum ] and  [ sec : disk - fermions ] ) , which has some nice applications .",
    "for instance , we discuss a possibility to hide extra dimensions similar to  @xcite , and we generate small fermion masses via a discrete version of the wavefunction suppression mechanism  @xcite .",
    "we consider a 6d model where both extra dimensions form a discretised curved disk ( for example a part of a 2-sphere ) while the 4d subspace remains continuous . before the discretisation the space - time",
    "is described by the line element@xmath1 where  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 denote 4d and 6d coordinates , respectively .",
    "the position on the disk is fixed by the polar coordinate  @xmath4 $ ] and the radial coordinate  @xmath5 $ ] with  @xmath6 being the coordinate radius of the disk . from  ( [ eq : disk-6d - metric ] ) we read off the metric components  @xmath7 of the 4d subspace as well as  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 .",
    "note that the parameter  @xmath10 controls the curvature of the disk .",
    "for  @xmath11 the disk is spherically curved , whereas  @xmath12 leads to a hyperbolic disk , and @xmath13 corresponds to a flat disk . following  @xcite we now decompose the 6d einstein - hilbert action @xmath14 into three parts , where @xmath15 ,  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 denote the 6d curvature scalar , the determinant of the metric  @xmath18 and the 6d planck scale , respectively .",
    "we find that the 4d curvature scalar  @xmath19 in @xmath20 contains only the 4d metric  @xmath21 and derivatives with respect to  @xmath2 .",
    "the surface terms in  @xmath22 vanish by choosing suitable boundary conditions on the disk , and  @xmath23 is given by@xmath24.\\ ] ]    let us now introduce 4d graviton fields  @xmath25 on a flat minkowski metric  @xmath26 by the expansion @xmath27 .",
    "as in  @xcite we choose a gauge , where we ignore graviphoton and radion excitations , which could result from the  @xmath28 and  @xmath29 components of the metric .",
    "since  @xmath30 is constant we have  @xmath31 and by expanding  @xmath23 in second order in  @xmath25 we find@xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next , we discretise the disk by putting  @xmath0 lattice sites on the boundary and a single site in centre of the disk so that only two points are lying in radial direction .",
    "the coordinate distance between the centre and each point on the boundary is given by the radius  @xmath6 of the disk , which in general differs from its proper radius .",
    "on the boundary , the graviton fields are denoted by  @xmath33 with  @xmath34 , and the position is given by  @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the angular lattice spacing .",
    "the graviton field  @xmath37 in the centre carries the index  @xmath38 , and the lattice spacing in radial direction is just  @xmath39 .",
    "formally , we apply the following discretisation prescription to  @xmath23@xmath40 @xmath41 where the integral  @xmath42 is replaced by just one summation interval of length  @xmath6 and the summand is evaluated at the position  @xmath43 , which avoids problems with the derivative  @xmath44 at  @xmath45 .",
    "thus we obtain ( still non - diagonal ) fierz - pauli mass terms  @xcite for the gravitons on the discretised disk , that read ( with  @xmath46)@xmath47.\\label{eq : disk - s - graviton - mass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the actual graviton mass scale from the radial derivatives ,  @xmath48 , and respectively from the angular derivatives ,  @xmath49 , depend on the 4d planck mass  @xmath50 of the observer s site ( brane):@xmath51 however , the ratio of masses is independent of the planck scales,@xmath52 which also shows that arbitrarily large hierarchies between  @xmath48 and  @xmath49 are possible by choosing the disk parameters  @xmath53 and  @xmath0 appropriately .    in order to determine the 4d planck mass  @xmath50 on the sites we need the proper area of the curved disk , which is given by@xmath54    we now proceed to discretise  @xmath22 . since the extra - dimensional disk has a constant curvature it is well motivated that  @xmath50 should be constant and universal on all sites , too .",
    "thus the einstein - hilbert terms of all  @xmath55 sites must have the form@xmath56 which does not depend on  @xmath57 and  @xmath58 anymore . by comparing this term with  @xmath59",
    "we find that the 4d planck scale on the sites is fixed by @xmath60 , where we used  ( [ eq : disk - proper - area ] ) in  @xmath22 and evaluated the sum in  ( [ eq : disk - sum - eh ] ) .",
    "however , we remark that  @xmath50 is not the ( reduced ) planck scale @xmath61 that couples gravity to 4d matter . but  @xmath62 is determined by integrating out the extra dimensions in the continuum , which means @xmath63 and thus @xmath64 .",
    "we omit to show the kinetic terms for the 4d gravitons  @xmath33 .",
    "they just follow from applying the graviton expansion to the einstein - hilbert terms in  ( [ eq : disk - sum - eh ] ) , see e.g.  @xcite . to determine the graviton mass spectrum we have to diagonalise  @xmath23 in  ( [ eq : disk - s - graviton - mass ] ) by a unitary transformation .",
    "if we denote the graviton mass eigenstates by  @xmath65 , corresponding to the masses  @xmath66 , we find the following relations for the eigenvectors:@xmath67\\cdot h_{\\mu\\nu}^{i},\\label{eq : disk - ev - hp}\\\\ h_{\\mu\\nu}^{n } & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n(n+1)}}\\left[-n\\cdot h_{\\mu\\nu}^{0}+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}h_{\\mu\\nu}^{i}\\right],\\label{eq : disk - ev - hn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where  @xmath68 . the eigenvalues  @xmath66 are respectively given by@xmath69 from these results we observe that the zero - mode  @xmath70 has a flat profile and is equally located on all sites , whereas the mode  @xmath71 with squared mass  @xmath72 is peaked on the centre site with equal support on the boundary sites .",
    "the modes  @xmath73 with  @xmath68 are located only on the boundary with a typical finite kaluza - klein ( kk ) mass spectrum that has been shifted by  @xmath74 . in the limit",
    "@xmath75 the masses of the states  @xmath73 in  ( [ eq : disk - ev - hp ] ) become degenerate , and for  @xmath76 the mode  @xmath71 becomes very heavy .",
    "note that the latter case can be realised by a sufficiently large negative curvature of the disk , which is a clear advantage over a flat disk model .",
    "finally , we mention that a scenario related to ours has been discussed recently in the context of multi - throat geometries  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that large extra dimensions can be hidden in the sense that the occurrence of massive kk modes is shifted to energies much higher than the compactification scale of the extra dimension , which helps evading limits on kk particles . in our model",
    "this behaviour can be observed for the modes  @xmath77 in the limit  @xmath78 , too .",
    "let us now investigate the incorporation of dirac fermions into the discretised disk model of section  [ sec : disk - curved - disk ] .",
    "as for the graviton case we start with a 6d dirac fermion  @xmath79 in the continuum . using the vielbein formalism , the corresponding action  @xmath80 on the curved disk reads@xmath81\\!,\\label{eq :",
    "disk-6d - fermion - action}\\ ] ] where we denote 6d lorentz indices by  @xmath82 and general coordinate indices by  @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "moreover ,  @xmath84 are 6d dirac matrices , and for the barred spinor  @xmath85 we use the abbreviation @xmath86 .",
    "the vielbein components  @xmath87 follow from the relation  @xmath88 , which connects the lorentz coordinate system with the general coordinate system . for the diagonal metric  ( [ eq : disk-6d - metric ] )",
    ", we find  @xmath89 with the exceptions  @xmath90 and  @xmath91 . on a curved space - time",
    "the covariant derivative  @xmath92 for spinors contains in addition to the usual partial derivative  @xmath93 also the spin connection  @xmath94v_{a}^{n}v_{bn;m}.$ ]    to determine the form of the 6d @xmath95-matrices  @xcite let us first look at the 4d case , where the @xmath95-matrices are given by @xmath96\\!,\\qquad\\gamma^{k}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 0 & \\sigma^{k}\\\\ -\\sigma^{k } & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\!,\\qquad\\gamma^{5}=\\rmi\\gamma^{0}\\gamma^{1}\\gamma^{2}\\gamma^{3}.\\ ] ] here ,  @xmath97 and  @xmath98 denote the pauli matrices . in five dimensions",
    "the number of spinor components is still four and the corresponding @xmath95-matrices are simply given by  @xmath99 , @xmath100 and  @xmath101 . in six dimensions , however , the dirac algebra is 8-dimensional , where we use the following set of @xmath95-matrices@xmath102\\!,\\qquad g^{6}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 0 & \\gamma^{0}\\\\ -\\gamma^{0 } & 0\\end{array}\\right]=-(g^{6})^{\\dag},\\\\ g^{n } & = & \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 0 & \\gamma^{0}\\gamma^{n}\\\\ -\\gamma^{0}\\gamma^{n } & 0\\end{array}\\right]=-(g^{n})^{\\dag},\\qquad n=1,2,3,5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which fulfil the cifford algebra  @xmath103 .    from the form of the vielbeins and the @xmath95-matrices it follows that all spin connection components  @xmath104 vanish except for @xmath105\\sqrt{1-er^{2}}$ ] . and",
    "because of  @xmath106 the terms involving  @xmath107 in  ( [ eq : disk-6d - fermion - action ] ) cancel .",
    "let us now diagonalise the fermion action by the substitution  @xmath108 .",
    "then the decomposition of the eight - component spinor  @xmath109 into two four - component spinors  @xmath110 , @xmath111 yields in  ( [ eq : disk-6d - fermion - action ] ) @xmath112\\times\\left[\\left(\\begin{array}{cc } \\gamma^{0 } & 0\\\\ 0 & \\gamma^{0}\\end{array}\\right)\\partial_{0}+\\left(\\begin{array}{cc } -\\gamma^{k } & 0\\\\ 0 & \\gamma^{k}\\end{array}\\right)\\partial_{k}\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ \\qquad+\\left.\\left(\\begin{array}{cc } -\\rmi\\gamma^{5 } & 0\\\\ 0 & + \\rmi\\gamma^{5}\\end{array}\\right)v_{5}\\partial_{5}+\\left(\\begin{array}{cc } 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1\\end{array}\\right)v_{6}\\partial_{6}\\right]\\times\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\phi_{a}\\\\ \\phi_{b}\\end{array}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with  @xmath113 . from the last line one can read off that  @xmath110 corresponds to  @xmath111 but with negative energy , therefore we will work only with  @xmath111 in the following .",
    "if we now denote the left- and right - handed components of  @xmath111 by  @xmath114 , then the full action for  @xmath111 can be written in the form@xmath115,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have applied the boundary conditions of section  [ sec : disk - curved - disk ] after integration by parts .    since 6d spinors have mass dimension  @xmath116 we have to rescale them in order to obtain usual 4d spinors . as in the graviton case we integrate the kinetic terms over the extra dimensions and apply a similar discretisation procedure as in section  [ sec : disk - curved - disk ] , which means@xmath117 where  @xmath118 is the proper area given in  ( [ eq : disk - proper - area ] ) .",
    "finally , we absorb the factor  @xmath119 into the fermion fields @xmath120 and subsequently apply the discretisation prescriptions  ( [ eq : disk - discretprescription ] ) with  @xmath25 replaced by  @xmath121 . as a result we obtain the action for  @xmath55 4d fermions , ( @xmath122)@xmath123 with the mass scales  @xmath124 and  @xmath125 .",
    "hence , the ratio  @xmath126 is the same ratio as in  ( [ eq : disk - graviton - mass - ratio ] ) for the gravitons .",
    "next , we apply a bi - unitary transformation relating the states  @xmath121 to the mass eigenstates  @xmath127:@xmath128 the corresponding mass spectrum contains one massless fermion  @xmath129 , one heavy fermion  @xmath130 with mass  @xmath131 and  @xmath132 fermions  @xmath133 with squared absolute mass values  @xmath134 .",
    "in contrast to the graviton mass spectrum  ( [ eq : disk - graviton - masses ] ) , here we find an additional interference term  @xmath135 , which can be removed by a slightly modified discretisation procedure for the angular direction .",
    "instead of  @xmath136 we use the prescription  @xmath137 .",
    "this does not change the zero more or the heavy mode , but the transformations in  ( [ eq : disk - fermion - trafo ] ) lead now to the mass spectrum  @xmath138 for the modes  @xmath139 , which has exactly the same structure as that of the gravitons in  ( [ eq : disk - graviton - masses ] ) .",
    "our results for the fermions on the discretised disk can be applied directly to generate small fermion masses . for this purpose",
    "we put the standard model of particles  ( sm ) on the centre site of our disk . in this place",
    "the left - handed sm lepton doublet  @xmath140 may couple to the 4d component  @xmath141 of the 6d dirac field and to the vacuum expectation value  @xmath142 of the higgs doublet via an yukawa interaction term schematically given by  @xmath143 .",
    "now , a large number  @xmath144 of lattice sites lets  @xmath145 decouple due to its large mass  @xmath131 , and  ( [ eq : disk - fermion - trafo ] ) shows that the right - handed fermion  @xmath141 on the centre site essentially consists only of the zero - mode  @xmath146 with a tiny weight factor  @xmath147 .",
    "thus the yukawa interaction of  @xmath140 with  @xmath141 , @xmath148 leads to a strong suppression of the sm neutrino  ( @xmath149 ) mass , representing a discrete version  @xcite of the wave function suppression mechanism in continuous higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "our 6d model with a discretised extra - dimensional curved disk leads to mass spectra that have the same structure for gravitons and fermions .",
    "moreover , the special discretisation of the disk allows that the ratio of mass scales in the spectra can be adjusted in a flexible manner by the parameters of the disk .",
    "it is thus possible to obtain a gap between the zero mode and the first massive mode that is much larger than the gap between the other massive modes .",
    "we have also discussed the generation of small sm fermion masses in this setup .",
    "finally , we mention that the strong coupling regime of this model and a more refined scenario including warping were investigated in  @xcite , where some of our results have been applied , too .",
