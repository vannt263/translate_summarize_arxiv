    "in quantum field theory ( qft ) , the energy associated with the vacuum is formally proportional to the sum of energies of all field modes . in most situations of interest ,",
    "the summation is ultraviolet divergent . nonetheless ,",
    "because the energy spectra of fields depend on boundary conditions , it can be argued that the total vacuum energy does too ; changing boundary conditions can shift vacuum energy by a finite amount and produce physical and observable effects .",
    "for example , the vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field between two parallel conducting plates depends on their separation and induces a macroscopic force , known as the casimir force , that can be measured experimentally ( see e.g. @xcite ) . beside the parallel plate setup",
    ", vacuum energy has been discussed and computed in a wide range of other situations and is known to depend subtly on both geometry and topology @xcite .",
    "vacuum energy is of fundamental importance for several reasons . since",
    "its effects can be measured experimentally , it offers direct verification of theoretic techniques for extracting finite physical quantities from formally divergent expressions in qft .",
    "there currently seems to be an essentially sound understanding of these issues in the laboratory context .",
    "however , since the gravitational field in standard theory couples to the stress - energy of matter fields and not to differences in energy , the discrepancy between the formally divergent value of the vacuum energy in qft and the flatness of the observed universe is sometimes quoted in the context of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "vacuum energy also appears in discussions of tests for extra dimensions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for these and other reasons , vacuum energy has been studied in the literature from many points of view ( see e.g. the reviews @xcite as well as recent works involving pistons @xcite ) . in one approach , the summation over field mode energies is regularized using an explicit cutoff @xmath0 .",
    "this is a useful approach because it reveals that the divergent contributions to the vacuum energy are proportional to the volume and the boundaries of the region containing the field @xcite .",
    "in some situations , these divergent contributions can be removed or neutralized in a controlled fashion @xcite .",
    "having parametrized them using the scale @xmath0 , however , tempts one to ask the question whether their structural form , i.e. their proportionality to volume and boundary , can be observable .",
    "related issues have been raised previously in discussions related to the role of boundary conditions and materials in vacuum energy calculations @xcite . in this paper , such terms",
    "are shown to be observable when the field potential is space dependent .",
    "the next section introduces the particular field theory studied in this paper .",
    "it is a scalar field theory with a potential that is quadratic in the field and that is assumed to depend on position .",
    "the potential is used to define a cuboidal cavity to which the field is confined , on whose boundary the field obeys dirichlet conditions , and within which the field has a constant mass @xmath1 . in this setup",
    ", the vacuum energy can be explicitly computed using the regularization technique with cutoff @xmath0 . in two dimensions ,",
    "the vacuum energy contains terms that are proportional to the area and perimeter of the cavity in addition to other terms that are either finite independently of the cutoff @xmath0 or vanish when the cutoff is large .",
    "this result is then used in the context of a potential defining two adjacent regions in a large cavity to show , following @xcite , that the force on a piston separating the two regions is independent of the terms in the vacuum energy proportional to the area and perimeter .",
    "this calculation sets the stage for secs .",
    "[ s_exotic ] and [ s_3d ] , but also extends @xcite by including the field mass and other recent works on cavities with pistons @xcite by discussing the effect of a soft piston on the observable force .    in sec .",
    "[ s_exotic ] , the potential of the scalar field is manipulated in order to make the force on a set of pistons in a large cavity depend on the area and perimeter of one region of the cavity .",
    "two distinct scenarios are described , each associated with its own designer potential .",
    "these scenarios are highly idealized but are nonetheless significant because they demonstrate that the physical effects of vacuum energy do not necessarily need to become negligible as the regions in the cavity become large . in sec .",
    "[ s_3d ] , these scenarios are extended to three dimensions and their possible observability is discussed .",
    "section [ s_conclusion ] summarizes the results and discusses the implications of the proposed scenarios on the understanding of vacuum energy , including its role in the gravitational context .",

    "this potential defines a hypercuboidal cavity with side lengths @xmath9 ( which can be all different ) .",
    "the field has mass @xmath1 inside the cavity ; the infinite potential outside the cavity imposes dirichlet conditions on its boundary and prevents the field from leaking out . for @xmath10 , field modes",
    "@xmath11 are given by standing waves and their energies are given by _ * n*^2 = m^2+()^2++ ( ) ^2 , with @xmath12 .",
    "the vacuum energy , being the sum of all field mode energies , is [ e0one ] e(a_1,  ,a_d ; m ) = _ n_1=1^_n_d=1^_*n*. since this expression is ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent , it must be manipulated in order to extract physical information from it .",
    "one way to proceed is through analytic regularization .",
    "this technique can be successfully applied in many situations and returns a finite answer ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , because the technique automatically subtracts all divergent contributions to the vacuum energy , it also eliminates the possibility of understanding them in detail .    a different technique that leaves one more manual control involves introducing an explicit cutoff scale @xmath0 and modifying ( [ e0one ] ) into [ elambda ] e_(a_1,  ,a_d ; m ) = _ n_1=1^_n_d=1^_*n * d_(_*n * ) , where d_(_*n*)=d_(,,;m ) is an analytic cutoff function that behaves as @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "this formula reduces to ( [ e0one ] ) for @xmath17 but gives a finite energy otherwise , parametrizing the divergences in ( [ e0one ] ) using the scale @xmath0 .    in @xmath18 ,",
    "when the potential @xmath19 defines a rectangular cavity with side lengths @xmath20 and @xmath21 , ( [ elambda ] ) becomes [ elambdad2 ] e_(a_1,a_2 ; m ) = _ n_1=1^_n_2=1^(m^2+()^2 + ( ) ^2)^1/2 d_(,;m ) .",

    "there are at least two reasons why this would be a problematic result .",
    "first , this force contains contributions that grow with the cutoff @xmath0 .",
    "if the cutoff were to be taken to infinity , the resulting force would diverge and would therefore require further manipulation .",
    "a possibility for eliminating the divergences would be to try to subtract from ( [ elsummary ] ) the vacuum energy associated with a region of flat space having the same shape but without special boundary conditions imposed .",
    "this minkowski vacuum energy , however , would be of the form of the area term in ( [ elsummary ] ) , so the subtraction would fail to eliminate the divergent term proportional to the perimeter ; the subsequently computed force would still contain a term that diverges for large @xmath0 .",
    "even if the cutoff @xmath0 were assumed to be finite , perhaps related to the planck scale , there would still be a problem because ( [ fdiverge ] ) would be nonzero even when @xmath35 .",
    "such behavior in three dimensions would be in conflict with basic observations .",
    "second , assuming that @xmath20 can be varied freely is in violations of assumptions made in the calculations of @xmath36 . more specifically , changing @xmath20 by a finite length implies shifting the background potential @xmath19 by an infinite amount .",
    "the problem of preserving the total background energy could be avoided by considering joint changes in @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which preserve the area @xmath37 . in this case , the formula ( [ fdiverge ] ) would be modified but the first issue above would remain .      an elegant resolution to these problems was proposed in @xcite . instead of the small cavity with side lengths @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "consider the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_box2 ] where a large cavity with fixed side lengths @xmath38 and @xmath21 is divided by a vertical piston into two regions , labeled @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with side lengths @xmath20 by @xmath21 and @xmath41 by @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "the piston is therefore `` hard '' and enforces strict dirichlet conditions on its surface .",

    "the force associated with moving the piston , @xmath45 , thus depends only on the regular terms @xmath46 . since these terms become independent of @xmath20 when @xmath47 , the force is then also zero consistently with results obtained using analytical regularization techniques @xcite .    in this setup ,",
    "moving the piston also does not change the overall level of the background potential .",
    "this setup thus resolves both issues discussed in association with the calculation leading to ( [ fdiverge ] ) .",
    "it does not do this by eliminating uv divergences but rather by neutralizing them by summing contributions to the vacuum energy from fields in two neighboring regions . since in laboratory situations there",
    "always exists an outside region ( region @xmath40 ) to a cavity under investigation ( region @xmath39 ) , this resolution is satisfactory for all practical purposes .      in the above discussion",

    "that these terms depend only weakly on @xmath0 implies that predictions based on ( [ embox2 ] ) are equivalent , in the practical sense , for any sufficiently large , but not necessarily infinite , @xmath0 .",
    "this observation suggests that the force computable from ( [ embox2 ] ) is actually due to low - energy effects and is independent of how very high energy modes respond to the piston . to see this ,",

    "the total still contains some terms that diverge in the @xmath44 limit as in the case of the hard pistons ; in this sense , the soft piston does not eliminate the divergent nature of the vacuum energy .    out of all the terms comprising ( [ esoftpiston ] ) ,",
    "the only ones that depend on @xmath20 are the regular parts @xmath52 in ( [ esoftlow ] ) . when @xmath49 is large , these parts depend only negligibly on this scale .",
    "therefore , the force on the soft piston in this cavity system is equivalent to the one obtained in the case for the hard piston . in the present calculation",
    ", however , the important terms are explicitly seen to arise from low - energy modes .",
    "the above argument is very rough . to make it more precise",

    ", however , @xmath49-dependent corrections should be negligible and the above conclusion should be valid .",
    "in particular , there should not be important corrections to the area and perimeter terms of the vacuum energy .",
    "this is because if there were , their dependence on @xmath20 would cancel from contributions from regions @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the effect of soft boundary conditions has also been discussed elsewhere in the literature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the calculations in the previous section reveal that divergences in the vacuum energy are proportional to the area and perimeter of a cavity , and that they need not be subtracted away in order to produce reasonable results for the force on a piston .",

    "the outer walls have side lengths @xmath38 and @xmath53 .",
    "there are two pistons , one horizontal and one vertical as shown , which divide the cavity into four regions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "it is assumed that the two pistons can move and thereby change the size and shape of the regions .",

    "this is a `` designer '' potential because the field is given different masses in different regions of space - a property not usually considered but perhaps not completely unreasonable in the context of theories implementing a dynamical mass - generation mechanism .",

    "if ( [ dlassumption ] ) does not hold , i.e. if the cutoff function is allowed to depend on @xmath1 , then the mass @xmath1 can play a subtle role in the integrals and the dependence of the coefficients on the cutoff may in some cases be removed . however , even by tweaking the cutoff function in this manner , neither ( [ sub1 ] ) or ( [ sub2 ] ) can be made to vanish completely .",
    "while both the area and perimeter terms are in principle observable , suppose that a constraint is imposed keeping the area @xmath63 of region @xmath39 fixed . in this case the term proportional to the area would be unobservable .",
    "however , since the potential is fluid ( by assumption ) , moving the pistons would change the vacuum energy by the term proportional to the perimeter , and this would produce a nonzero force .",

    "the coefficients of the area and perimeter terms would thus scale with @xmath49 rather than @xmath0 .",
    "high energy modes should be relatively unaffected by the positions of the pistons and so might not produce important @xmath0-dependent terms either .",
    "the magnitude of the boundary contribution would thus not depend on the cutoff and the soft piston could be said to regularize the observable terms in the vacuum energy .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the source of the observable terms would not lie in the precise nature of the soft pistons but rather on the different masses of the scalar field in the various regions of the cavity . in any case , since soft boundary conditions can sometimes lead to subtle effects @xcite , this issue should be investigated in more detail .",

    "it is possible that using soft pistons in that calculation may yield an effect that depends on the mass @xmath1 of the field or on another finite , intermediate scale that reflects the hardness or softness of the pistons .",
    "this issue is related to discussions of boundary conditions in other vacuum energy systems @xcite .    in the second scenario ,",
    "described in sec .",
    "[ s_exotic2 ] , one region of a cavity has a negligible potential for field modes with energy above a threshold @xmath49 and an effectively infinite potential for field modes with energy below @xmath49 .",
    "the observable part of the vacuum energy in this case again contains a term proportional to the volume and boundary of the special region .",
    "the mass scale associated with the effect in this case is @xmath49 .",
    "curiously , the sign of the boundary effect is opposite to that in the first scenario .",
    "these effects are interesting for both theoretical and observational reasons . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the scenarios described test understanding of regularization and renormalization methods in qft . in particular",
    ", a naive computation of vacuum energy in the first scenario with hard pistons , sec .",
    "[ s_exotic1 ] , using analytic regularization techniques would not predict a boundary effect .",
    "the described effect thus differentiates the cutoff and analytic regularization approaches and offers a way to determine which is the more correct way of understanding vacuum energy in qft .",
    "( the boundary effect in the second scenario , sec .",
    "[ s_exotic2 ] , could be argued to arise also within the analytic regularization scheme . )",
    "it is also interesting to compare the arguments and results of the two scenarios with other work which has shown that binding energies of bodies composed of a granular material are proportional to their volumes and boundaries @xcite . while the scaling of those effects is qualitatively similar to those in the two scenarios in sec .",
    "[ s_exotic ] , there are important differences between the two sets of calculations .",
    "one important difference is in the style of calculation . the calculations ( with hard pistons ) in sec .",
    "[ s_exotic ] are exact and do not depend on any subtraction prescription .",
    "they therefore emphasize the source of the observable volume and boundary terms as due to the nontrivial potential .",
    "another important difference between the two approaches is that in the first scenario in sec .",
    "[ s_exotic1 ] , the observable effects arise due to mass differences in distinct regions of space which can arise due to dynamics of a single field and can therefore arise in vacuum without interactions with any granular materials .",
    "these effects might also have interesting implications for issues in quantum gravity .",
    "the idea that the planck scale might provide a real uv cutoff for quantum field theory appears in many forms in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite for general arguments and e.g. @xcite for a few recent approaches ) .",
    "the present discussion suggests that quantum gravity models should take into account @xmath0-dependent contributions to the vacuum energy proportional to the boundary as well as the volume of the observable universe .",
    "that is , they should not only account for why the volume contribution to the vacuum energy does not generate a large cosmological constant , but should also explain the role of the boundary terms ( for possible consequences of the boundary terms on geometry , see @xcite . )    on the observational side , the boundary terms are interesting because their magnitudes increase with the size of a region .",
    "this is an interesting behavior for vacuum energy whose effects , apart in the case of materials @xcite , are usually inversely proportional to the separation between boundaries and therefore vanish for large systems .",
    "also , in contrast with other works where boundaries have been found to play a role ( e.g. @xcite ) , the effects described in this paper are dominant and not corrections .",
    "simple estimates of the magnitudes of the boundary energies in three dimensions in sec .",
    "[ s_3d ] show that they can be on the order of thermal energies and hence that they are not immediately ruled out by existing observations .",
    "testing for the boundary energies should therefore be interesting as a matter of principle . in practice",
    ", however , observation might be difficult due to the peculiar potentials required and due to the necessity of changing the shape and volume of regions of space in a precise and controlled fashion ."
