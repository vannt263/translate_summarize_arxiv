    "the myth of marriage has been and is still a fascinating historical societal phenomenon .",
    "paradoxically , the empirical divorce rates are at an all - time high . in order to design and evaluate interventions , theoretical understanding of marital stability and dissolution",
    "is crucial .",
    "this article describes a unique paradigm for preserving relationships and marital stability using mean - field game theory .",
    "the approach is quite general for modeling social interaction , and can be applied to empirical data generated over time .",
    "we look at marital interactions and relationships . here",
    "relationship refers to the unit ( couple ) , rather than to the two persons .",
    "we focus on a very ephemeral thing : what happens to the couple as they interact over time .",
    "it is not either person , it is something that happens when they are together , i.e. , in a couple",
    ". the couple will create something that we call a `` feeling state '' as they talk to each other , as they smile , as they move .",
    "we model the feeling state of a couple as a noisy differential equation influenced by random events , parents , children , friends and the social distribution of marital status ( mean - field of states ) , where the term `` mean - field '' refers to the distribution of couple feeling states in the society .    *",
    "why a mathematical model for marital interaction ?",
    "* putting the study of social relationships on mathematical footing represents a major advance in our ability to understand and perhaps regulate these relationships for the betterment of all mankind @xcite .",
    "the novelty of the present study inheres in the analysis of the social distribution of feeling states ( mean - field ) on a generic couple .    * on the influence of couple - feeling - states in society",
    ":* since the society , friends and parents of a couple may influence them in an aggregative manner , a mean - field approach is suitable for such an interaction . here",
    "the distribution of states ( mean - field)- of all couples in the society plays an important role in the payoff and in the effort used to maintain a marriage . game theory is a branch of mathematics which studies strategic interactions .",
    "our idea is to use mean - field games to capture the influence of society distribution of states on a generic couple .    in their pioneering work in @xcite , gottman et al .",
    "have widely illustrated the importance of mathematical theory in the field of marital research .",
    "in particular , they have shown that mathematical models help us to better understand the sentimental dynamics and hence to propose an appropriate intervention or therapy for a couple .",
    "the authors have developed a model to analyze marital instability , by calibrating a system of difference equations for the evolution of partners emotions during a conversation .",
    "the interaction dynamics is described by a function of experience and whose intuitive understanding of the influence among partners during conflict .",
    "more recently , rey @xcite formulated the sentimental relationship of a couple as an optimal control problem .",
    "a state variable monitors the wellness of the relationship whose natural decay in time must be counteracted with effort according to a widely accepted principle in marital psychology .",
    "stationary sentimental steady states are examined in @xcite the context of infinite horizon discounted optimal control problems .",
    "none of these previous works considered the influence of model uncertainty , noise , random events , and the social distribution of states ( mean field ) . in this work",
    "we examine these important issues .",
    "this paper has three main features :    * we introduce stochastic optimal control in marital interaction .",
    "we explicitly characterize the optimality equations under random fluctuations which comes from model uncertainty in the drift function of the feeling state . *",
    "we examine the impact of mean - field and effort in the feeling state of the couple . *",
    "we propose a mean - field game model for marriage in a non - linear setup where generically two stable states ( divorce and marriage ) are observed .",
    "we study the impact of the network of couples on the feeling state .",
    "we show that , in mean - field equilibrium , the optimal effort of the mean - field sentimental game is always higher than the one - shot optimal effort if the social contribution is controlled .",
    "while the study here focuses on marital interaction , the mathematical methodology can be applied to other situations such as a society s ecological or smoking behavior . to the best our knowledge",
    "this is the first attempt to model and understand marital interactions through mean - field influence and stochastic games .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a generic model of sentimental dynamics examining both controlled and uncontrolled situations .",
    "after that we introduce mean - field sentimental games . then , we analyze the optimal behavior and mean - field sentimental equilibria with and without noise . as an illustration",
    "we examine an interesting sentimental dynamics wherein marriage and divorce can be seen as  stable \" steady states .",
    "adding strategic effort behavior into such couple dynamics can change the long - term behavior of their feeling state if the system is uncontrolled .",
    "we first present a basic mathematical framework for feeling state and well - being of a couple .",
    "we will explain below how the model can be modified to include the ( positive or negative ) impact of the society ( and the `` social pressure '' ) on a generic couple .",
    "we describe the sentimental dynamics , define the payoff functional for the marital interaction and state the optimal control problem .",
    "the feeling state ( feeling level ) @xmath0 of the couple is modeled as an it s stochastic differential equation : @xmath1,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath3 represents the expected variation of the feeling in a short time window , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is smooth and goes to infinity with @xmath6 @xmath7 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "the effort function @xmath8 can be controlled by the couple .",
    "the sentimental dynamics is expected to start at a high feeling level @xmath9 greater than @xmath10 where @xmath10 is a certain threshold value below which the relationship of the couple is not considered as satisfactory .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 represents the efficiency of the effort .",
    "the deterministic part of the governing feeling state is an experimental derivation from marital studies @xcite .",
    "however , here , the function @xmath5 is not necessarily monotone in @xmath6 we introduce a stochastic term into the sentimental dynamics of the existing literature @xcite for multiple reasons : ( 1 ) shocks , ( 2 ) random events in the social network of the couple may affect the couple , ( 3 ) the drift funtion @xmath12 may not be perfectly known .",
    "we add an uncertainty term into it .",
    "if the marriage starts with a feeling level @xmath9 and is stopped at the first time that @xmath13 is below a certain threshold @xmath14 or one of the couple member dies ( life expectancy is set to @xmath15 years ) then the length of the horizon is expected to be finite .",
    "this is why we consider a finite horizon problem .",
    "let @xmath16 , one can take @xmath17 which means that @xmath18 is a random variable .",

    "more details on risk - sensitive mean - field type control and games can be found in @xcite .",
    "we define a couple as a union of two adult persons having certain emotional and physical interactions , and living together .",
    "we define family as the direct ascendants and the direct descendants of the conjoint . in this sense",
    ", we read the quantity @xmath25 as the heritage that the couple bequeaths to the family in terms of well - being .",
    "this heritage will influence the next generation sentimental game .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the function @xmath26 increases with the feeling state and @xmath27 .",
    "the function @xmath28 is the well - being function of the couple .",
    "it depends on the feeling state @xmath0 in the sense that , the higher the feeling state , the more joyful the couple .",
    "the implicit purpose of the control problem is to increase well - being while taking into consideration the cost .",
    "thispurpose achieved by expanding the feeling state above a certain satisfactory level .",
    "contrastingly , couples with low feeling state are more or less happy and have the tendency to seize again .",
    "this tendency is expressed by taking actions ; caring for children , giving gifts , cooking special meals , making concessions , in short , handling the couple according to his or her expectation .",
    "we define the effort as a constructive action from one conjoint to the other conjoint .",
    "it might be useful for the reader to notice that our definition of effort does not take into account counterproductive actions .",
    "for example , knowing that juliette does not like football , it is negative that romeo takes her to the camp nou stadium for fc barcelona vs milan ac making her miss her preferred telenovella movies .",
    "the cost of effort can represent the psychological , financial and/or emotional load provided by the couple when accomplishing this effort . clearly , greater effort is more expensive as it imposes a higher cost .",
    "it is appropriate then to say that the couple continuously provides efforts to achieve a greater well - being of the couple itself .",
    "we adopt the following assumptions :    * the drift function @xmath29 is continuously differentiable ( @xmath30 ) , * the well - being function @xmath31 is @xmath30-differentiable , non - decreasing , concave and saturated at @xmath32 , * the cost function @xmath33 is twice continuously differentiable ( @xmath34 ) , non - decreasing and strictly convex .    in figure [ fig1:plotwellbeing]-[fig2:plotwellbeing ]",
    ", we illustrate the typical well - being and cost functions . in the next sections , we consider respectively an open - loop control problem , an optimal feedback strategy for the couple and a mean - field sentimental strategy .",

    "this does not depend explicitly on the state @xmath13 .",
    "one seeks for an optimal open loop effort strategy by applying the maximum principle to the following problem @xmath38 to do so , we use the hamiltonian and the adjoint process .",
    "first we analyze the deterministic case ( @xmath39 ) and then the open - loop noisy case .      when @xmath40 , the hamiltonian is @xmath41 a maximizer of @xmath42 with the respect to the effort provides an open - loop optimal control associated with the co - state ( adjoint ) process @xmath43 .",

    "thus , the existence of the value follows .      there is a significant consensus around the idea that the society state ( particularly the feeling states of the friends , parents , friends of friends and social environment ) may influence the status of the couple .",

    "moreover , a couple s tendency to divorce depends not just on their friends divorce status , but also extends to their friend s friends and so on .",

    ", one can see that for a couple starting with a fairly good feeling state ( @xmath162 ) the optimal strategy is to do actions . indeed",
    ", the couple will break up because of the negative influence of society and will line up with a null optimal effort . also , we observe the same phenomenon for a couple starting with a higher feeling state .",
    "the optimal effort is nevertheless important because starting at a higher feeling state can counterbalance the negative influence of the society .",
    "the optimal strategy for a couple starting with low feeling state is to provide zero effort .",
    "this is not surprising since in a low type society living , a couple follows a societal phenomenon .",
    "we can see from figure [ fig19_feedback_low ] that the optimal strategy effort for a couple starting with high feeling state is a time - decreasing function . in that case , doing good action",
    "is motivated more by seeking ideal happiness than by up - holding the couple .",
    "overall , we observe that the optimal strategy is cheaper in a low type society than in a high type society .",
    "we now address the numerical simulations for the mean - field equilibrium ( [ mf_system ] ) .",
    "the functional @xmath101 and @xmath87 are chosen as defined in ( [ mf_h_and_s ] ) , the functional @xmath5 is specified in ( [ h_expression ] ) , the effort cost and the well being intrinsic to the couple are given by ( [ c_and_s ] ) .",
    "the numerical experiment consists here in observing the evolution of the distribution @xmath119 representing the society in which a given couple lives . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we suppose that the reference couple has an almost constant optimal effort in a particular window .",
    "this implies that the value @xmath163 is linearized with respect to @xmath0 and constant in time .",
    "the numerical task is then to compute the fokker - planck - kolmogorov equation in ( [ mf_system ] ) .",
    "the developed algorithm focuses on unnormalized distribution ( positive measure ) .",
    "figure [ fig20mfe ] represents the evolution of the mean - field equilibrium with initial gaussian distribution centered at @xmath164 with standard deviation @xmath165 for a low type .",
    "when the initial distribution is a mixture of gaussian distributions centered at @xmath166 and @xmath164 with standard deviation @xmath165 , we observe in figure [ fig21mfe ] that the state distribution will propagate rapidly to be concentrated at the extreme in a relatively short time .    for the mean - field equilibrium ,",
    "the symmetric steady states observed previously in the case where the control was a constant , are not steady state anymore because the feedback control @xmath167 is now dynamic in state as time goes .",
    "we observe that if the initial mean - field is a mixture of gaussians centered at @xmath168 and at @xmath169 with standard deviation @xmath170 then the feeling state will propagate and will be concentrated at the two extremes at the final time ( figure [ fig22mfet ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a mean - field game model for marriage , cohabitation , divorce and remarriage .",
    "our study suggests that the optimal effort may help in sustaining marriage and cohabitation if the cost of that effort is acceptable and the initial couple state is not too low .",
    "this helps us to understand at least theoretically the key processes related to marital dissolution , co - habitation separation , stability and fluctuation",
    ". the study can be useful to design or evaluate an adequate intervention .",
    "it also suggests that knowing many divorced people may influence the status of a marriage .",
    "the more divorced people you know , the riskier your own marriage .",
    "however , a marriage does nt break down just because friends are divorcing .",
    "marital breakdown depends on many factors including effort and mean field .",
