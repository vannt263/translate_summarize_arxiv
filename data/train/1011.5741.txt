    "the regularity of their photometric properties and the existence of remarkable scaling relations among their observable quantities may naively suggest that early - type galaxies ( etgs ) are well understood systems . on the contrary , understanding their mass content and density profile is still a hotly debated issues mainly because of both theoretical shortcomings and observational difficulties .",
    "indeed , on the one hand , the lack of a reliable mass tracer makes it difficult to constrain the gravitational potential in the outer ( supposedly dark matter dominated ) regions , although planetary nebulae surveys ( napolitano et al . 2001 , 2002 ;",
    "romanowsky et al .",
    "2003 ) are trying to address this problem .",
    "on the other hand , the availability of a higher number of possible tracers in the inner regions has not improved so much the situation with the same data be reproducible in terms of different ( and somewhat contrasting ) scenarios because of the uncertainties on the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .    in the classical newtonian framework ,",
    "dark matter ( dm ) dominates the outer galaxy regions ( see , e.g. , van den bosch et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b , 2007 ) , but weighting its contribution in the inner regions where stellar matter plays a not negligible role is quite difficult .",
    "as pointed out by mamon & lokas ( 2005a , b ) , the observational data claim for a dominant stellar component at a radius @xmath5 , but such a conclusion heavily relies on the imf choice , with the salpeter ( 1995 ) and chabrier ( 2001 ) as leading but not unique candidates . on large scales , the dm",
    "content has been found to be a strong function of both luminosity and mass @xcite with a different behaviour between faint and bright systems .",
    "looking for a similar result for the dm content at @xmath6 is quite controversial . on one hand ,",
    "some authors @xcite argue for no dependence .",
    "in contrast , other works @xcite do find that brighter galaxies have a larger dm content , while a flattening and a possible inversion of this trend for lower mass systems , similar to the one observed for late - type galaxies @xcite , is still under analysis @xcite with no conclusive result yet obtained .",
    "it is worth stressing that all these results rely on dynamical analysis , i.e. they are obtained by fitting a given model to the observed velocity dispersion data . as such , they are plagued by the mass - anisotropy degeneracy introducing an unknown systematic bias which is difficult to quantify . as an alternative",
    ", one can rely on gravitational lensing which directly probes the full mass content projected along the line of sight . in the strong lensing regime , the formation of einstein rings allows to constrain the total mass projected within the einstein ring independently of the model .",
    "if coupled to a measurement of the central velocity dispersion , this method gives interesting constraints on the mass profile in the inner regions .",
    "on one hand , dark matter mass fractions and their scaling with stellar mass and luminosity can be constrained assuming a model for the halo @xcite or the total mass profile @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one can also try to constrain the stellar imf by making some assumptions on the dark matter content @xcite . in the opposite regime",
    ", galaxy - galaxy lensing allows to investigate the outer regions estimating the total mass - to - light ( @xmath2 ) ratio @xcite although large samples are needed to get reliable results .    in spite of the quite large range spanned by their morphological and photometric properties , etgs show several interesting correlations among their colors , luminosities , velocity dispersions , effective radii and surface brightness , the most famous example being the fundamental plane fp , a log - linear relation between the effective radius @xmath3 , the intensity @xmath7 , and the central velocity dispersion @xmath0 ( djorgovski & davis 1987 , dressler et al .",
    "1987 , bender et al .",
    "1992 , burstein et al .",
    "this fundamental plane is usually parameterized as : @xmath8 with @xmath9 predicted to be @xmath10 if etgs are homologous systems in virial equilibrium and with a constant @xmath2 ratio . the observed plane is , however , tilted with respect to the virial one since the different determinations of @xmath9 , depending on the photometric band and the sample used , are always different from the virial values .",
    "jorgensen et al ( 1996 ) first derived @xmath11 and @xmath12 from a set of 225 early - type galaxies in nearby clusters observed in the r - band . while this result is consistent with the original observations of djorgovsky & davis ( 1987 ) and dressler et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , it is nevertheless in striking contrast with the most recent determination relying on @xmath13 etgs observed within the framework of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . using this large sample , bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have found @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which are more similar to the k - band fundamental plane of pahre et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . while the precise values of the fp coefficients are still debated , it is nevertheless clear that the observed fp is tilted with respect to the predicted plane .",
    "such a tilt could be caused by a variation in the dynamical @xmath2 ratio for etgs as a result of a varying dark matter fraction ( e.g. , padmanabhan et al .",
    "2004 ; boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2005 , cappellari et al .",
    "2006 , tortora et al . 2009 ) or stellar population variations ( e.g. , gerhard et al .",
    "moreover , non - homology in the surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , graham & colless 1997 ; trujillo et al 2004 ) may be an other explanation of the fp tilt as the _ virial fp _ even if , as explained , deviations from this plane do not imply that etgs are unvirialized systems . ] .",
    "all the above results have been obtained assuming that the classical newtonian theory of gravity may be used also on galactic scales .",
    "however , the outer regions of galaxies typically are in a low acceleration regime and in this regime newtonian dynamics has never been experimentally tested . motivated by this consideration , milgrom ( 1983 ) proposed to modify newton s second law of dynamics as @xmath16 , where the acceleration @xmath17 is now related to the newtonian one @xmath18 as @xmath19 . here",
    ", @xmath20 is a new universal constant and @xmath21 may be an arbitrary function with the properties @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the theory thus obtained , referred to as _",
    "modified newtonian dynamics _ ( mond ) , provides flat rotation curves for spiral galaxies and , as a by - product , gives a theoretical interpretation of the empirically determined tully - fisher law . since its beginnings , mond has been widely tested as an alternative to dark matter with remarkable success on galaxy scales ( see , e.g. , sanders & mcgaugh 2002 , milgrom 2008 and refs . therein ) receiving a renewed interest after the proposal of a possible fully covariant relativistic formulation referred to as teves @xcite .    motivated by these successful results , we model etgs as a single component system derived from the observed luminosity profile and check whether the resulting mond dynamics is consistent with the data .",
    "to this end , assuming a constant anisotropy model for the velocity dispersion profile , we compute the aperture velocity dispersion @xmath24 and compare it with the observed value for a large sample of local etgs . fitting the @xmath24 data provides us a consistency check of mond .",
    "indeed , should the mond predicted values be smaller than the observed one or ask for unrealistic anisotropy profile , one can argue that dm is still needed .",
    "should , on the contrary , mond overestimates @xmath24 , one should reconsider the choice of the interpolating function @xmath21 or the acceleration constant @xmath20 . as a byproduct",
    ", this test also allows us to estimate the anisotropy profile which can then be used to infer how the theoretical fp looks like in the mond framework .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that @xmath24 mainly probe the inner regions of the galaxy where dark matter is not expected to play a dominant role . as a consequence , although our analysis is definitely in the context of the mond vs dm controversy , we do not expect to give a conclusive answer on this debate , but we nevertheless make a further step towards a possible solution .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the mass density profile adopted for describing the etgs luminous component , while the derivation of the aperture velocity dispersion in the mond framework is given in section 3 .",
    "we then show , in section 4 , how mond predicts a fp - like relation for etgs which we refer to as the _ mond fundamental plane _",
    "section 5 is then devoted to both motivating the mfp and testing the viability of mond in reproducing the observed dynamics of etgs , while the predicted mfp coefficients are given in section 6 and compared to those of the observed fp .",
    "we finally summarize our results and discuss possible implications in section 7 , while in the appendix a and b we briefly investigate the wavelength dependence of the mfp coefficients and discuss the impact of deviations from the main assumptions considered in the paper .",
    "in spite of their wide mass , size and luminosity range and the different chemical and stellar population characteristics , etgs present a remarkable similarity in their photometric properties .",

    "it turns out that eq.([eq : premfp ] ) indeed works quite well with @xmath168 and @xmath169 values that are actually quite smaller than the rms one over most of the parameter space explored is of order @xmath170 over most of the parameter space explored . ] .",
    "moreover , there is no trend with any of the parameters so that we can conclude that replacing the exact solution eq.([eq : reffsolve ] ) with the approximated one eq.([eq : premfp ] ) does not introduce any bias thus giving a theoretical support to our derivation of the mfp .",
    "such a test makes also possible to infer the values of the @xmath111 coefficients and how they depend on the anisotropy parameter .",
    "we first note that the use of the approximated formula has made the coefficients @xmath9 to deviate from the values @xmath10 one should have inferred from eq.([eq : reffsolve ] ) in the newtonian case .",
    "while this is only a marginal difference for @xmath114 , the effect is quite important for @xmath171 .",
    "moreover , it is clear that , although trends of all the coefficients with the anisotropy parameter are clearly detected , the variation may be essentially neglected for @xmath114 . on the other hand , both @xmath171 and @xmath172 significantly depend on @xmath79 so",
    "that we expect a scatter in the mfp coefficients @xmath173 due to the variation of the anisotropy parameter from one galaxy to another .",
    "we finally stress that the dependence of @xmath174 on @xmath79 does not have any impact on the slope of the mfp , but introduces a scatter in the zeropoint @xmath175 which translates into a scatter of galaxies around the best fit plane",
    ".    one could wonder whether these results depend on the adopted mond interpolating function . to this aim",
    ", we have repeated the above analysis considering the standard form for @xmath21 hence setting    @xmath176 } { \\gamma[n(3 - p_n ) , b_n \\eta^{1/n } ] } \\right ) ^2 } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : standgamma}\\ ] ]    in eq.([eq : defilos ] ) .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath177 are essentially the same thus suggesting a very weak dependence of the theoretical mfp coefficients on the particular @xmath21 function considered .",
    "this can be qualitatively explained noting that @xmath178 is evaluated inside a very small aperture .",
    "although formally the integral entering @xmath179 is defined along the full line of sight , integrating it over the very inner region of the galaxy , where @xmath180 , makes the details of this function unimportant and explains why the choice of @xmath21 has such a small impact on mfp coefficients .",
    "while the above discussion shows that the derivation of the mfp is theoretically well founded , we still have to verify that mond is indeed able to match the dynamics of etgs without resorting to dark matter . for each galaxy in the catalogue , we have both the photometric quantities @xmath122 and the stellar @xmath2 ratio @xmath40 so that , using eq.([eq : sfp ] ) , we can compute the aperture velocity dispersion as a function of the anisotropy parameter only . matching the observed @xmath24 to",
    "the theoretically predicted one makes then possible to constrain the constant anisotropy parameter @xmath79 .",
    "note that , to this end , we directly use the observed @xmath24 , while @xmath0 is used when considering the mfp .",
    "two considerations motivated this choice .",
    "first , we have estimated @xmath0 converting @xmath24 through eq.([eq : sigmacorr ] ) . actually , this relation has been derived assuming the validity of newtonian gravity ) can be derived by assuming a galaxy model and the anisotropy profile and then computing the ratio @xmath181 as function of the mass and anisotropy parameters .",
    "this is indeed how j@xmath149rgensen et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) derived their relation under the assumption that newtonian gravity is correct .",
    "] , while our analysis is in the mond framework .",
    "although it is likely that eq.([eq : sigmacorr ] ) still applies in the mond case being @xmath0 evaluated within the @xmath182 region , it is a more conservative choice not to use any correction and then checking a posteriori the validity of eq.([eq : sigmacorr ] ) . as a second motivation , we note that @xmath0 is evaluated within @xmath183 where baryons are likely the dominant contribution and the newtonian regime for acceleration holds . on the contrary , @xmath184 ( with @xmath185 ) spans the @xmath186 confidence range @xmath187 with @xmath188 as median value .",
    "kinematical analysis in the newtonian framework suggest that the dark matter mass fraction within @xmath189 is of order @xmath190 ( for a salpeter imf ) .",
    "we therefore expect that @xmath24 is more suited than @xmath0 to test the validity of mond since it refers to a region where dm may play a not negligible role .",
    "a further remark is in order here before the fitting analysis .",
    "first , both the photometric quantities and the stellar @xmath2 ratio are known with an error and the same holds for the observed @xmath24 . in order to take this into account",
    ", one could randomly generate a large ensemble of values for @xmath191 according to a multinormal distribution with central vector and covariance matrix set by the observed values . solving for @xmath79 each time",
    ", we can finally estimate @xmath79 and its error from the distribution thus obtained .",
    "because of the large etgs sample we are dealing with , such a work is computationally quite expensive .",
    "however , we are here mainly interested in checking whether mond is able to fit the data rather than deriving the exact value of the anisotropy parameter for every single galaxy .",
    "moreover , we need the value of @xmath79 or @xmath192 to estimate @xmath173 and the scatter in the mfp so that we are interested in its probability distribution function . for these reasons",
    ", we will neglect the errors on the observed quantities and simply take their central values for each galaxy in the sample .",
    "it is worth stressing that the shape of probability distribution for @xmath79 depends on the adopted filter , because both @xmath40 and the photometric quantities @xmath122 are wavelength dependent .",
    "moreover , the sample of galaxies we will fit is not the same for all the filters .",
    "in fact , for a given galaxy , the sersic index @xmath1 changes from one filter to another so that it is possible that a galaxy with @xmath193 has @xmath194 in an another filter @xmath195 , thus looking more similar to a disky system rather than an etg one .",
    "moreover , because of code failures or observational problems , some galaxies in the @xmath196 and @xmath197 filters may have @xmath198 or an unmeasured absolute magnitude so that they have to be rejected from the sample .",
    "we stress , however , that more than @xmath199 of the galaxies in the starting catalog are present in all the subsamples used to determine the @xmath79 distribution in the different filters . here , we discuss only the results for the fit in the @xmath128 filter thus using all the galaxies in the sample .",
    "the analysis in the remaining bands is similar .",
    "since both the photometric parameters and the stellar @xmath2 ratio have been fixed , we can straightforwardly solve the equation @xmath200 with respect to @xmath79 for each individual galaxy and then look at the distribution of the results .",
    "such a procedure successfully works for all the galaxies in the sample with @xmath79 values definitely pointing towards a strong radial anisotropy .",
    "this result is not surprising because , as well known in newtonian gravity , radial anisotropy helps to lower the need for dark matter in the inner region of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "for instance , de lorenzi et al . (",
    "2008 ) , using the nmagic code to fit the observed velocity dispersion profile of ngc 4697 , have found evidence of a mildly varying anisotropy profile with @xmath201 in the inner regions . in the mond framework ,",
    "only part of the dm contribution is provided by the effect of the @xmath202 function entering @xmath24 , while radial anisotropy supplies the remaining term needed to match the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "while radially anisotropic models are able to match the data , their physical consistency is not a priori guaranteed . in order to be self consistent ,",
    "our density profile should be derived from a distribution function of the form @xmath203 with @xmath115 the specific angular momentum and @xmath204 a function of the binding energy @xmath205 .",
    "the function @xmath204 has to be positive definite in order the model to be physically meaningful .",
    "necessary conditions for the consistency of anisotropic models in the newtonian framework have been derived in the literature @xcite . some of them may be extended also to mond models taking into account that , for this purpose , mond models behave like newtonian ones in an external effective potential @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "this latter can be derived by demanding that the mond acceleration @xmath59 entering eq.([eq : jeanseq ] ) equals @xmath207 , i.e. one must integrate ( numerically ) the equation @xmath208 with the condition that @xmath209 vanishes at infinity .    in the newtonian framework ,",
    "an & evans ( 2006 ) have shown that , if the potential and the density are self consistently related , a necessary condition for the positivity of the df of constant anisotropy models is @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the logarithmic slope of the density profile at the centre .",
    "ciotti & morganti ( 2010 ) have however shown that this result can be extended to models with an external potential which is a case mond can be compared to .",
    "we can therefore use the an & evans result for the consistency of mond constant anisotropy models . for the ps case , it is @xmath212 so that @xmath213 must be taken as an upper limit on @xmath79 to have physically consistent models .    in order to take the above limit into account , we adjust both @xmath79 and an effective @xmath2 ratio @xmath214 , where @xmath215 accounts for deviations from the stellar @xmath2 computed assuming a universal chabrier imf . to this end , for each galaxy in the sample , we determine @xmath215 varying @xmath79 over the range @xmath216 with @xmath217 and finally take as our best estimate the one with the smallest value of @xmath218 . note that , in this way , we get models that are both physically consistent and with only minor deviations from the initial recipe for the stellar @xmath2 ratio . imposing @xmath219 for the selected solution ( see later for the motivation of such a selection criterium ) , we find that @xmath220 of the galaxies may be successfully fitted with this procedure .",
    "specifically , from the @xmath79 and @xmath215 distributions , we find :    @xmath221    @xmath222    @xmath223    @xmath224    it is worth wondering whether the spread in @xmath215 can be fully ascribed to variations in the stellar population properties . indeed , the estimate of @xmath40 from the galaxy colours depend on the details of the stellar population synthesis code we have used .",
    "there are many ingredients entering this code so that it is not fully unrealistic to expect that they can change from one galaxy to another , while here we have assumed them to be universal .",
    "for instance , a simple recipe to increase @xmath40 is to change the imf from the chabrier one , that we have used here , to the salpeter one .",
    "it is worth noting that there is indeed still an open debate on what the imf actually is . on one hand ,",
    "direct star counts and observations ( mainly , in the milky way ) point towards a chabrier ( or kroupa ) imf , but our galaxy is a spiral . on the other hand , gravitational lensing ( see , e.g. , treu et al . 2010 ) and studies of the central dm fraction in local etgs ( napolitano et al .",
    "2010 ) suggest that also a salpeter imf can reconcile data and observations for etgs provided a nfw model is assumed for the dark matter halo . motivated by these contrasting results , one can not exclude an imf varying with luminosity @xcite or a correlation between the timescale of exponential star formation rate and the luminosity .",
    "moreover , the metallicity and the dust content may also change on a case - by - case basis .",
    "considering a conservative @xmath225 uncertainty on @xmath40 for a given imf and that @xmath40 has to be scaled by a factor 1.8 when replacing the chabrier imf with the salpeter one , we finally get @xmath219 as a range for this parameter",
    ". should @xmath215 be outside this ( conservative ) range , one should conclude that dark matter is needed to fill the gap between stellar and dynamical mass .",
    "needless to say , the results we get for @xmath215 are fully consistent with the statistical uncertainty on the estimated @xmath40 .",
    "while this outcome is expected by construction , the fact that we are able to find a physically acceptable value of @xmath79 makes us argue in favour of mond being able to fit the velocity dispersion data with no dark matter provided a reasonable amount of anisotropy is allowed .",
    "it is worth noting that the confidence ranges for @xmath79 are strongly asymmetric .",
    "actually , @xmath226 of the fitted models have @xmath227 with the remaining @xmath228 giving rise to a long flat tail towards negative @xmath79 . if we simply cut our sample only retaining isotropic and radially anisotropic solutions , we find that the velocity dispersion may be fitted for @xmath229 of the galaxies . actually , this fraction is still larger if we repeat the above analysis , but now imposing @xmath227 .",
    "the fit turns out to be successful for @xmath230 of the sample giving the following values characterizing the @xmath79 and @xmath215 distributions :    @xmath231    @xmath232    @xmath223    @xmath233    the spread in @xmath79 is now reduced with no statistical meaningful shift of the median value , while the shift in the mean is a consequence of the more symmetric distribution .",
    "the large fraction of successfully fitted galaxies then leads us to conclude that a mild radial anisotropy allows us to get physically consistent models able to fit the data with no need for dark matter in a mond framework .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath79 does not correlate neither with the photometric parameters @xmath122 nor with the total luminosity @xmath115 .",
    "such a result has an important outcome .",
    "since the mfp coefficients @xmath234 given by eq.([eq : mfpcoeff ] ) depend on @xmath79 through @xmath111 , a strong correlation of @xmath79 with @xmath115 could generate a correlation between @xmath234 and @xmath156 and one should find different mfps for different luminosity bins .",
    "however , this effect is likely to be weak because @xmath111 are actually weak function of @xmath79 ; moreover , we need to have an mfp independent of luminosity because the observed fp is approximately unique for all the etgs .",
    "as discussed in appendix b , a correlation of @xmath215 with @xmath115 could change the mfp coefficients . on the one hand ,",
    "such a correlation is expected noting that the dynamical @xmath2 ratio @xmath235 is found to correlate with luminosity when fitting data in the newtonian+dark matter framework .",
    "surprisingly , we do not find any scaling relations between @xmath215 and @xmath115 . indeed , this is a consequence of how we select the best fit model for each galaxy .",
    "let us suppose that a relation like @xmath236 exist for models with @xmath79 fixed .",
    "depending on @xmath237 and the galaxy luminosity , one could then obtain a value of @xmath238 .",
    "but we have chosen as best fit model the one having as small a value as possible of @xmath218 so that , should @xmath215 become too large , our algorithm would change @xmath79 ( and hence @xmath215 ) to minimize @xmath218 . as a consequence ,",
    "unless the correlation is quite strong , our selection criterim washes out a possible scaling of @xmath215 with @xmath115 .",
    "we stress , however , that this is not a limitation of our analysis , but rather a consequence of consistently working in a mond framework .",
    "the above results convincingly show that mond is able to fit the aperture velocity dispersion in etgs without the need for additional dm .",
    "actually , the data we are using mainly probe the region @xmath239 which is not in the deep mond regime @xmath240 .",
    "indeed , for the galaxies in the sample , the median value of @xmath241 is 0.56 , while the @xmath242 confidence range is given by @xmath243 , i.e. @xmath244 .",
    "we are therefore in an intermediate regime where the total acceleration @xmath114 is roughly of the same order of magnitude as @xmath20 .",
    "we therefore expect that it is possible to fit the same data without dm also in the newtonian regime . to this end",
    ", we have used the same equations as above setting @xmath245 to recover the newtonian formulae .",
    "moreover , we have still to take into account the upper limit on @xmath79 so that we use the same procedure as above adjusting the anisotropy parameter and the ratio @xmath215 between the dynamical and the stellar @xmath2 ratio .    imposing the same cut on @xmath215 , we find that @xmath246 of the galaxies can be successfully fitted , a fraction smaller than in the mond case , but still satisfactorily large .",
    "it is , however , interesting to note that , for most of the galaxies , the value of @xmath79 is quite close to the upper limit , while typical @xmath215 values are larger than in the mond case .",
    "indeed , we get :    @xmath247    @xmath248    @xmath249    @xmath250    as it is apparent from the @xmath215 confidence ranges , one must increase the @xmath2 ratio up to very large values that , while still marginally consistent with deviations from the stellar one because of a different imf , may be also easily interpreted in terms of a non negligible dark matter content .",
    "needless to say , this is consistent with expectations since we know that , unless an unreasonably high radial anisotropy is introduced , newtonian gravity can not explain etgs dynamics without the boost provided by a dark matter halo .",
    "it is worth comparing the values of @xmath251 obtained in the mond and newtonian cases for each galaxy .",
    "we find :    @xmath252    @xmath253    @xmath254    @xmath255    these values clearly show that newtonian models have a larger radial anisotropy and @xmath215 value than mond ones in agreement with the expecations .",
    "indeed , for given model parameters , the boost to the newtonian velocity dispersion provided by the @xmath67 factor reduces the need for both radial anisotropy and deviations from the fiducial stellar @xmath2 . not surprisingly , we find that @xmath256 is correlated with @xmath241 so that the smaller is this quantity , the smaller is @xmath256 .",
    "this is exactly what one can anticipate noting that the smaller is @xmath241 , the larger is the region of the galaxy where the mond regime applies so that the smaller is the value of @xmath257 needed to fit the data for the same value of the anisotropy parameter .",
    "eq.([eq : mfpcoeff ] ) makes it possible to estimate the mfp parameters without considering anymore the zeropoint @xmath175 . ]",
    "@xmath173 provided the values of @xmath258 are given and the anisotropy profile parameter has been set so that @xmath177 may be computed .",
    "the analysis in the previous section has demonstrated that mond is able to fit the measured aperture velocity dispersion of the assembled etgs sample and has enabled us to determine the distribution of @xmath79 for the galaxies in our sample . in order to compute the mfp coefficients , we first need to determine @xmath258 as we discuss in the following subsection .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is immediate to see that the mfp coefficients are essentially the same ( within the errors ) whatever is the adopted filter .",
    "this is an expected result since both @xmath258 and the @xmath79 distribution are very weak function of wavelength .",
    "this is in net contradiction with the observed fp coefficients that move towards the virial one @xmath10 as the wavelength increases . as a consequence , the tilt of the mfp changes with the filter thus leading further constraints on the underlying unknown phenomenon that has to be invoked to reconcile theory with observations .",
    "up to now , we have adopted a fully mond framework .",
    "specifically , we have assumed that the visible matter is the only source of gravity generating the motion of the stars and that their acceleration may be computed from the newtonian one with eq.([eq : mondgeq ] ) . as we have seen , this model is able to fit the etg velocity dispersion data , but leads to an mfp which is still tilted with respect to the observed one .",
    "we therefore qualitatively discuss here what could be the impact of relaxing one of the two assumptions above to see whether deviations from our idealized mond scenario may help to reconcile the theoretical mfp with the observed fp .",
    "we admit that this section is quite speculative , but we include it here in order to propose some scenarios that could be tested with future data or a different tracer of the etgs gravitational potential .      according to the original idea motivating the introduction of mond , nothing but the visible matter",
    "should be considered when modelling a galaxy and trying to fit the data . as a corollary to this assumption",
    ", the total @xmath2 ratio @xmath259 must equal the stellar @xmath40 .",
    "even if in order to avoid too much radial anisotropy we have allowed to rescale the @xmath2 by the parameter @xmath215 , we have finally chosen the solution with @xmath215 as close as possible to @xmath81 to be consistent with the idea of no dark matter .",
    "some general considerations , however , may be invoked to depart from the @xmath260 ansatz .",
    "first , it is well known that mond needs a dark matter component in order to be in agreement with data on the galaxy cluster scale ( aguirre et al .",
    "2001 ; sanders 2003 ; pointconteau & silk 2005 ; angus et al .",
    "2007 , 2008a ) .",
    "should this further term be represented by a 2ev neutrinos ( sanders 2003 , 2007 ) or 11ev sterile neutrinos ( angus 2009 ; angus et al . 2010 ) arranged in a hot dark halo , the total @xmath2 ratio should be larger than the stellar one . on the other hand ,",
    "our estimated @xmath40 depends on the ingredients used to obtain the starting library of stellar population models .",
    "changing one of these ingredients would alter @xmath40 possibly leading to an effective @xmath259 larger than our assumed stellar @xmath2 value . as a simple way to account for this possibility",
    ", we redefine the effective surface mass density as :                  needless to say , introducing @xmath262 changes the distribution of the fitted anisotropy parameter and the values of the @xmath111 coefficients . assuming , as a first approximation , that the change in @xmath79 is not too large , we solve @xmath268 with respect to @xmath269 . by using the median values of @xmath270 for the constant anisotropy model and @xmath271",
    ", we find @xmath272 .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar scaling is obtained when comparing stellar and dynamical masses in a newtonian stellar+dark halo framework @xcite .",
    "actually , reproducing such a scaling of @xmath262 with luminosity can be problematic in a mond scenario . as quoted above , in order to have @xmath273 , one has to postulate the presence of a halo made of ( 2ev or 11ev ) neutrinos .",
    "we now find that such a term should provide a contribution to the velocity dispersion that increases with the total luminosity in a similar way as the dark halo in newtonian gravity .",
    "explaining how neutrinos in the halo interact with the baryons in the stellar component in such a way to reproduce the needed scaling of @xmath262 with @xmath115 can be a difficult hurdle to overcome .",
    "should such a mechanism be found , the problem of the tilt of the mfp is indeed solved .",
    "introducing @xmath274 in the expression for @xmath275 and using the median values of @xmath270 gives @xmath276 which is essentially the same as for the @xmath277 case .",
    "this can be explained by looking at the approximated expression reported above showing that the same term @xmath278 enters both the numerator and the denominator thus weakening the correction . as a result ,",
    "the predicted @xmath275 is still in agreement with the observed one thus completely solving the tilt problem .      as a second possibility , we consider modifying the relation between newtonian and mond acceleration .",
    "we note that eq.([eq : mondgeq ] ) implicitly assumes that the galaxy is an isolated system . since mond is a non - local theory , the motion of the stars in the galaxy",
    "is actually determined not only by the galaxy potential , but also by the distribution of matter outside the galaxy itself .",
    "this is usually referred to as the _ external field effect _",
    "( efe ) and is taken into account by replacing eq.([eq : mondgeq ] ) with the following one :          with @xmath283 .",
    "comparing eq.([eq : efegamma ] ) with ( [ eq : simplegamma ] ) shows that , for given stellar parameters , @xmath100 for efe is smaller than the one for the simple function so that the predicted velocity dispersion is smaller .",
    "such a somewhat counterintuitive result can be qualitatively explained by noting that the efe term @xmath280 increases the newtonian acceleration and delays the transition from the newtonian to the mond regime . as a consequence ,",
    "the boost in acceleration ( and hence in @xmath0 ) due to the mond effect starts later and reduces @xmath0 with respect to the no efe case .",
    "with @xmath0 and @xmath285 the velocity dispersion without and with the efe taken into account .",
    "note that proceeding this way allows us to estimate @xmath111 using the values found for the no efe simple case .",
    "in a first reasonably good approximation , it is :              which reduce to eq.([eq : mfpcoeff ] ) for @xmath290 , i.e. no efe effect . in order to get an estimate of @xmath291",
    ", we can assume that the values of @xmath177 are the same as those computed using the median @xmath79 value obtained by fitting the constant anisotropy model with no efe to the data .",
    "setting @xmath258 to the median values in table 1 for the @xmath128 filter and solving @xmath268 , we finally get @xmath292 , i.e. brighter galaxies should be affected by a lower efe .",
    "investigating whether such a correlation is observationally motivated is a rather difficult task . in order to estimate @xmath280",
    ", one can not resort to a fit to galaxies binned in luminosity since the magnitude of the efe depend on the environment in which a given galaxy is embedded .",
    "although it is possible to study the environment of the etgs in our sample on a case - by - case basis , their large number makes this task quite beyond the scope of this paper . as a general remark",
    ", we however note that the efe is typically invoked to improve the fit to the rotation curves of dwarf spiral galaxies ( see , e.g. , angus 2008 ) , while the value of @xmath280 is smaller for milky way like systems .",
    "this observation goes in the right direction .",
    "moreover , one has to take care also of the symmetry of the problem .",
    "brighter galaxies are typically more massive and hence populate the inner regions of clusters where they feel the combined action of many galaxies around .",
    "one can naively expect that the random orientation of the efe from each companion leads to a sort of compensation thus lowering @xmath280 for brighter systems .",
    "however , a further quantitative analysis is mandatory in order to lend support to this scenario ."
