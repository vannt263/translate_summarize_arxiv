    "a symbolic framework for boundary problems was built up in  @xcite for linear ordinary differential equations ( lodes ) ; see also  @xcite for more recent developments .",
    "one of our long - term goals is to extend this to boundary problems for linear partial differential equations ( lpdes ) .",
    "since this is a daunting task in full generality , we want to tackle it in stages of increasing generality . in the first instance , we restrict ourselves to _ constant coefficients _ , where the theory is quite well - developed  @xcite . within this class",
    "we distinguish the following three stages :    1 .",
    "the simplest is the cauchy problem for _ completely reducible _ operators .",
    "2 .   the next stage will be the _ cauchy problem _ for general hyperbolic lpdes .",
    "3 .   after that we plan to study _ boundary problems _ for elliptic / parabolic lpdes .    in this paper",
    "we treat the first case ( section  [ sec : cauchy - analytic ] ) .",
    "but before that we build up a _ general algebraic framework _ ( sections  [ sec : boundary - data ] and  [ sec : greens - operators ] ) that allows a symbolic description for all boundary problems ( lpdes / lodes , scalar / system , homogeneous / inhomogeneous , elliptic / hyperbolic / parabolic ) . using these concepts and tools",
    "we develop a general solution strategy for the cauchy problem in the case  ( 1 ) .",
    "see the conclusion for some thoughts about the next two steps .",
    "the passage from lodes to lpdes was addressed at two earlier occasions :    * an _ abstract theory of boundary problems _ was developed in  @xcite , including lodes and lpdes as well as linear systems of these .",
    "the concepts and results of sections  [ sec : boundary - data ] and  [ sec : greens - operators ] are built on this foundation , adding crucial concepts whose full scope is only appreciated in the lpde setting : boundary data , semi - homogeneous problem , state operator .",
    "* an algebraic language for _ multivariate differential and integral operators _ was introduced in section  4 of  @xcite , with a prototype implementation described in section  5 of the same paper .",
    "this language is generalized in the pidos algebra of section  [ sec : cauchy - analytic ] , and it is also implemented in a mathematica package .    in this paper",
    "we will not describe the current state of the _ implementation _ ( mainly because of space limitations ) .",
    "let us thus say a few words about this here .",
    "a complete reimplementation of the pidos package described in  @xcite is under way . the new package is called opido ( ordinary and partial integro - differential operators ) , and it is implemented as a standalone mathematica package unlike its predecessor , which was incorporated into the theorema system .",
    "in fact , our reimplementation reflects several important design principles of theorema , emphasizing the use of functors and a strong support for modern two - dimensional ( user - controllable ) parsing rules .",
    "we have called this programming paradigm funpro , first presented at the mathematica symposium  @xcite .",
    "the last current stable version of the ( prototype ) package can be found at  http://www.kent.ac.uk/smsas/personal/mgr/index.html .    at the time of writing , the ring of _ ordinary integro - differential operators _",
    "is completed and the ring of _ partial integro - differential operators _ is close to completion ( for two independent variables ) .",
    "compared to  @xcite , the new pidos ring contains several crucial new rewrite rules ( instances of the substitution rule for resolving multiple integrals ) .",
    "our conjecture is that the new rewrite system is noetherian and confluent but this issue will be analyzed at another occasion .",
    "_ notation_. the algebra of  @xmath0 matrices over a field  @xmath1 is written as  @xmath2 , where  @xmath3 or  @xmath4 is omitted .",
    "thus we identify  @xmath5 with the space of column vectors and  @xmath6 with the space of row vectors .",
    "more generally , we have  @xmath7 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we follow the _ abstract setting _ developed in  @xcite . we will motivate and recapitulate some key concepts here , but for a fuller treatment of these issues we must refer the reader to  @xcite and its references .    let us recall the notion of boundary problem .",
    "fix vector spaces  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 over a common ground field  @xmath1 of characteristic zero ( for avoiding trivialities one may assume  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 to be infinite - dimensional ) .",
    "then a _ boundary problem _",
    "@xmath10 consists of an epimorphism  @xmath11 and a subspace  @xmath12 that is orthogonally closed in the sense defined below .",
    "we call  @xmath13 the differential operator and  @xmath14 the _ boundary space_.    similar to the correspondence of ideals / varieties in algebraic geometry , we make use of the following galois connection  ( * ? ? ?",
    "if  @xmath15 is any subspace of the space  @xmath8 , its _ orthogonal _ @xmath16 is defined as  @xmath17 .",
    "dually , for a subspace  @xmath14 of the dual space  @xmath18 , the orthogonal  @xmath19 is defined by  @xmath20 .",
    "if we think of  @xmath8 as `` functions '' and of  @xmath18 as `` boundary conditions '' , then  @xmath21 is the space of valid conditions ( the boundary conditions satisfied by the given functions ) while  @xmath22 is the space of admissible functions ( the functions satisfying the given conditions ) .",
    "naturally , a subspace of either  @xmath23 of  @xmath8 or  @xmath18 is called _ orthogonally closed _ if @xmath24 .",
    "but while any subspace of  @xmath8 itself is always orthogonally closed , this is far from being the case of the subspaces of the dual  @xmath18 .",
    "hence the condition on boundary spaces  @xmath14 to be orthogonally closed is in general not trivial .",
    "however , if  @xmath14 is finite - dimensional as in boundary problems for lodes ( as in example  [ ex : heat - conduction ] below ) , then it is automatically orthogonally closed . for lpdes ,",
    "the condition of orthogonal closure is important ; see example  [ ex : wave - inhom - medium ] for an intuitive explanation .    in  @xcite and",
    "also in the abstract setting of  @xcite we have only considered what is sometimes called the _ semi - inhomgeneous boundary problem _",
    "@xcite , more precisely the semi - inhomogeneous incarnation of  @xmath25 ; see definition  [ def : transfer - operator ] for the full picture .",
    "this means we are given a _ forcing function _ @xmath26 and we search for a solution  @xmath27 with @xmath28 in other words , @xmath29 satisfies the inhomogeneous `` differential equation '' @xmath30 and the homogeneous `` boundary conditions '' @xmath31 given in  @xmath14 .    a boundary problem which admits a unique solution  @xmath27 for every forcing function  @xmath32",
    "is called _ regular_. in terms of the spaces , this condition can be expressed equivalently by requiring that  @xmath33 ; see  @xcite for further details . in this paper",
    "we shall deal exclusively with regular boundary problems . for singular boundary problems we refer the reader to  @xcite and  @xcite .    for a regular boundary problem ,",
    "one has a linear operator  @xmath34 sending  @xmath35 to  @xmath29 is known as the _ green s operator _ of the boundary problem  @xmath25 . from the above",
    "we see that  @xmath36 is characterized by  @xmath37 and  @xmath38 .",
    "[ ex : heat - conduction ] a classical example of this notion is the two - point boundary problem . as a typical case ,",
    "consider the simplified model of _ stationary heat conduction _ described by @xmath39 here we can choose  @xmath40 for the function space such that the differential operator is given by @xmath41 and the boundary space by the two - dimensional subspace of  @xmath42 spanned by the linear functionals  @xmath43 and  @xmath44 for evaluation on the left and right endpoint .",
    "in the sequel we shall write  @xmath45 $ ] , employing an important generalization for lpdes , described in the next eamples .",
    "we can express its green s operator in the language of integro - differential operators as explained in  @xcite .",
    "[ ex : wave - inhom - medium ] as a typical counterpart in the world of lpdes , consider the _ equation for waves in an inhomogeneous medium _",
    ", described by @xmath46 in one space dimension . in this case",
    "we choose  @xmath47 ; again one could choose much larger spaces of functions ( or distributions ) in analysis and in the applications . here",
    "the differential operator is  @xmath48 while the boundary space  @xmath49 is the orthogonal closure of the linear span of the families of functionals  @xmath50 and  @xmath51 defined by  @xmath52 and  @xmath53 . using the notation @xmath54 $ ] for denoting the orthogonal closure of the linear span , we can thus write  @xmath55 $ ] for the boundary space under consideration .",
    "the point of the _ orthogonal closure _ is that the given conditions imply other conditions not in their span , for example  @xmath56 or  @xmath57 .",
    "rather than being linear consequences , these two examples are differential and integral consequences .",
    "( of course the full boundary space also contains many functionals without a natural analytic interpretation . )    in the problems above , the differential equation is inhomogeneous while the boundary conditions are homogeneous .",
    "a _ semi - homogeneous boundary problem _ is the opposite , combining a homogeneous differential equation with inhomogeneous boundary conditions . while this is a simple task for lodes ( as always we assume that the fundamental system is available to us in some form ! ) , it is usually a nontrivial problem for lpdes ( even when they have constant coefficients )",
    ". we will give the formal definition of a semi - inhomogeneous boundary problem in the next section ( definition  [ def : transfer - operator ] ) .",
    "here it suffices to consider an example for developing the necessary auxiliary notions .",
    "[ ex : cauchy - wave - eq ] the _ cauchy problem for the wave equation _ in one dimension is @xmath58 being a hyperbolic problem , we could use rather general function spaces for the `` boundary data '' @xmath59 . for reasons of uniformity",
    "we will nevertheless restrict ourselves here to the analytic setting , so assume  @xmath60 .",
    "note that the association of  @xmath29 to  @xmath61 is again a linear operator mapping ( two univariate ) functions to a ( bivariate ) function ; we will come back to this point in definition  [ def : transfer - operator ] .",
    "going back to the abstract setting , one is tempted to define the notion of boundary data as some kind of functions depending on `` fewer '' variables .",
    "but the problem with this approach is that  abstractly speaking  we are not dealing with any functions depending on any number of variables ( but see below ) .",
    "moreover , the inhomogeneous boundary conditions in the form  @xmath62 are basis - dependent while the whole point of the abstract theory is to provide a _ basis - free description _ ( which leads to an elegant setting for describing composition and factorization of abstract boundary problems ) ; see proposition  [ prop : bp - product ] .",
    "we shall therefore develop a basis - independent notion of boundary data ( we can go back to the traditional description by choosing a basis ) .",
    "we define first the _ trace map _  @xmath63 as sending  @xmath64 to the functional  @xmath65 .",
    "in example  [ ex : cauchy - wave - eq ] this would map the function  @xmath66 to its position and velocity values on  @xmath67 .",
    "we call  @xmath68 the trace of  @xmath35 and write it as  @xmath69 . moreover , we denote the image of the map  @xmath70 by  @xmath71 and refer to its elements as _ boundary data_. note that  @xmath71 is usually much smaller than the full dual  @xmath72 since a continuous function ( let alone an analytic one ) can not assume arbitrary values .",
    "( this situation is vaguely reminiscent of the algebraic and continuous dual of a topological vector space . )    since by definition the trace map is surjective from  @xmath8 to  @xmath71 , it has some right inverse  @xmath73 .",
    "we refer to  @xmath74 as an _ interpolator _ for  @xmath49 since it constructs a `` function ''  @xmath75 from given boundary values  @xmath76 such that  @xmath77 .",
    "of course , the choice of  @xmath35 is usually far from being unique .",
    "apart from its use for describing boundary data ( see at the end of this section ) , the notion of interpolator will turn out to be useful for solving the semi - homogeneous boundary problem ( see proposition  [ prop : proj - transfer ] ) .",
    "let us now describe how to relate these abstract notions to the usual setting of initial and boundary values problems as they actually in analysis : essentially by _ choosing a basis_. however , we have to be a bit careful since we must deal with the orthogonal closure .",
    "[ def : boundary - basis ] if  @xmath78 is any orthogonally closed subspace , we call a family  @xmath79 a _ boundary basis _ if  @xmath80 $ ] , meaning  @xmath49 is the orthogonal closure of the span of the  @xmath81",
    ".    note that a boundary basis is typically smaller than a  @xmath1-linear basis of  @xmath49 .",
    "all traditional boundary problems are given in terms of such a boundary basis .",
    "in example  [ ex : cauchy - wave - eq ] , the boundary basis could be spelled out by using  @xmath82 with  @xmath83 and  @xmath84 .",
    "relative to a boundary basis  @xmath79 , we call  @xmath85 the _ boundary values _ of  @xmath64 .",
    "as we can see from the next proposition , we may think of the trace as a basis - free description of boundary values .",
    "conversely , one can always extract from any given boundary data  @xmath86 the boundary values  @xmath87 as its coordinates relative to the boundary basis  @xmath88 .",
    "[ lem : trc - coord ] let  @xmath78 be a boundary space with boundary basis  @xmath89 . if for any  @xmath90 one has  @xmath91 then also  @xmath92 . in particular , for any  @xmath64 , the trace  @xmath69 depends only on the boundary values  @xmath93 .    since  @xmath71 is the image under the trace map , we have  @xmath94 and  @xmath95 for some  @xmath96 .",
    "so assume  @xmath97 for all  @xmath98 and thus  @xmath99 for all  @xmath100 by the definition of orthogonal closure .",
    "then we have  @xmath101 and thus  @xmath102 .",
    "the _ analytic interpretation _ of this proposition is clear in concrete cases like example  [ ex : wave - inhom - medium ] : once the values  @xmath103 and  @xmath104 are fixed , all differential and integral consequences , as in the above examples  @xmath56 or  @xmath105 , are likewise fixed .",

    ", we can always extract the boundary values  @xmath118 of some boundary data  @xmath86 relative to fixed basis  @xmath88 of  @xmath49 .",
    "however , since one normally has got _ only _ the boundary values ( coming from some function ) , where does the corresponding  @xmath119 come from ? by definition , it has to assign values to all  @xmath120 , not only to the  @xmath81 making up the boundary basis . as suggested by the above lemmata , for actual computations those additional values will be irrelevant .",
    "nevertheless , it gives a feeling of confidence to provide these values : if  @xmath74 is any _ interpolator _ , we have  @xmath121 .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that  @xmath74 is a right inverse of the trace map and that it depends only on the boundary values  @xmath122 by lemma  [ lem : int - coord ] . in the analysis setting this",
    "means we interpolate the given boundary value and then do with the resulting function whatever is desired ( like derivatives and integrals in example  [ ex : wave - inhom - medium ] ) .",
    "using the notion of boundary data developed in the previous section , we can now give the formal definition of the _ semi - homogeneous boundary problem_. in fact , we can distinguish three different incarnations of a `` boundary problem '' ( as we assume regularity , the _ fully homogeneous problem _ is of course trivial ) .",

    "the general solution will become the state operator for the cauchy problem .",

    ".   stage ( 1 ) was presented in this paper , but the _ detailed implementation _ for some of the methods explained here is still ongoing .",
    "the crucial feature of this stage is that it allows us to stay within the ( rather narrow ) confines of the pidos algebra . in particular , no fourier transformations are needed in this case , so the analytic setting is entirely sufficient .",
    "2 .   as we enter stage ( 2 ) , it appears to be necessary to employ stronger tools .",
    "the most popular choice is certainly the _ framework of fourier transforms _ ( and the related laplace transforms ) .",
    "while this can be algebraized in a manner completely analogous to the pidos algebra , the issue of choosing the right function space becomes more pressing : clearly one has to leave the holomorphic setting for more analysis - flavoured spaces like the schwartz class or functions with compact support .",

    "but the _ general algebraic framework _ for boundary problems from sections  [ sec : boundary - data ] and  [ sec : greens - operators ] is applicable , so the main work ahead of us is to identify reasonable classes of lpdes and boundary problems that admit a symbolic treatment of one sort or another .",
