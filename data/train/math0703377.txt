    "solving a general nonlinear optimal control problem ( ocp ) is a difficult challenge , despite powerful theoretical tools are available , e.g. the maximum principle and hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) optimality equation .",
    "the problem is even more difficult in the presence of state and/or control constraints .",
    "state constraints are particularly difficult to handle , and the interested reader is referred to capuzzo - dolcetta and lions @xcite and soner @xcite for a detailed account of hjb theory in the case of state constraints . there",
    "exist many numerical methods to compute the solution of a given optimal control problem ; for instance , _ multiple shooting _ techniques which solve two - point boundary value problems as described , e.g. , in @xcite , or _ direct methods _ , as , e.g. , in @xcite , which use , among others , descent or gradient - like algorithms . to deal with optimal control problems with state constraints , some adapted versions of the maximum principle have been developed ( see @xcite , and see @xcite for a survey of this theory ) , but happen to be very hard to implement in general .",
    "on the other hand , the ocp can be written as an infinite - dimensional linear program ( lp ) over two spaces of measures .",
    "this is called the _ weak _ formulation of the ocp in vinter @xcite ( stated in the more general context of differential inclusions ) .",
    "the two unknown measures are the state - action _ occupation measure _ ( o.m . ) _ up to _ the final time @xmath0 , and the state o.m .",
    "_ at _ time @xmath0 .",
    "the optimal value of the resulting lp always provides a lower bound on the optimal value of the ocp , and under some convexity assumptions , both values coincide ; see vinter @xcite and hernandez - hernandez et al .",
    "@xcite as well .",
    "the dual of the original infinite dimensional lp has an interpretation in terms of `` subsolutions '' of related hjb - like optimality conditions , as for the unconstrained case .",
    "the only difference with the unconstrained case is the underlying function space involved , which directly incorporate the state constraints .",
    "namely , the functions are only defined on the state constraint set .    an interesting feature of this lp approach with o.m.s is that state constraints , as well as state and/or action constraints are all easy to handle ; indeed they simply translate into constraints on the supports of the unknown o.m.s .",
    "it thus provides an alternative to the use of maximum principles with state constraints .",
    "however , although this lp approach is valid for any ocp , solving the corresponding ( infinite - dimensional ) lp is difficult in general ; however , general lp approximation schemes based on grids have been proposed in e.g. hernandez and lasserre @xcite .",
    "this lp approach has also been used in the context of discrete - time markov control processes , and is dual to bellman s optimality principle . for more details the interested reader",
    "is referred to borkar @xcite , hernandez - lerma and lasserre @xcite and many references therein . for some continuous - time stochastic control problems ( e.g. , modeled by diffusions ) and optimal stopping problems ,",
    "the lp approach has also been used with success to prove existence of stationary optimal policies ; see for instance cho and stockbridge @xcite , helmes and stockbridge @xcite , helmes et al .",
    "@xcite , kurtz and stockbridge @xcite , and also fleming and vermes @xcite . in some of these works ,",
    "the moment approach is also used to approximate the resulting infinite - dimensional lp .",
    "* contribution . * in this paper , we consider the particular class of nonlinear ocp s with state and/or control constraints , for which all data describing the problem ( dynamics , state and control constraints ) are _ polynomials_. the approach also extends to the case of problems with _ smooth _ data and compact sets , because polynomials are dense in the space of functions considered ; this point of view is detailed in  [ smooth ] . in this restricted polynomial framework",
    ", the lp approach has interesting additional features that can be exploited for effective numerical computation .",
    "indeed , what makes this lp approach attractive is that for the class of ocps considered :    @xmath1 only the _ moments _ of the o.m.s appear in the lp formulation , so that we already end up with countably many variables , a significant progress .",
    "@xmath1 constraints on the support of the o.m.s translate easily into either lp or sdp ( semi definite programming ) _ necessary _ constraints on their moments . even more , for ( semi - algebraic ) compact supports , relatively recent powerful results from real algebraic geometry make these constraints also _",
    "sufficient_.    @xmath1 when truncating to finitely many moments , the resulting lp or sdp s are solvable and their optimal values form a monotone nondecreasing sequence ( indexed by the number of moments considered ) of lower bounds on the optimal value of the lp ( and thus of the ocp ) .    therefore ,",
    "based on the above observations , we propose an approximation of the optimal value of the ocp via solving a hierarchy of sdps ( or linear matrix inequalities , lmis)that provides a monotone nondecreasing sequence of lower bounds on the optimal value of the weak lp formulation of the ocp . in adddition , under some compactness assumption of the state and control constraint sets , the sequence of lower bounds is shown to converge to the optimal value of the lp , and thus the optimal value of the ocp when the former and latter are equal .",
    "as such , it could be seen as a complement to the above shooting or direct methods , and when the sequence of lower bounds converges to the optimal value , a test of their efficiency .",
    "finally this approach can also be used to provide a _ certificate _ of unfeasibility . indeed ,",
    "if in the hierarchy of lmi - relaxations of the minimum time ocp , one is infeasible then the ocp itself is infeasible .",
    "it turns out that sometimes this certificate is provided at an early stage in the hierarchy , i.e. with very few moments .",
    "this is illustrated on two simple examples .    in a pioneering paper , dawson @xcite",
    "had suggested the use of _ moments _ in the lp approach with o.m.s , but results on the @xmath2-moment problem by schmdgen @xcite and putinar @xcite were either not available at that time .",
    "later , helmes and stockbridge @xcite and helmes , rhl and stockbridge @xcite have used lp moment conditions for computing some exit time moments in some diffusion model , whereas for the same models , lasserre and prieto - rumeau @xcite have shown that sdp moment conditions are superior in terms of precision and number of moments to consider ; in @xcite , they have extended the moment approach for options pricing problems in some mathematical finance models .",
    "more recently , lasserre , prieur and henrion @xcite have used the o.m .",
    "approach for minimum time ocp without state constraint .",
