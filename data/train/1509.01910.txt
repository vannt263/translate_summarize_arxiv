    "the domain boundary width is calculated by first considering each @xmath8 plane . the boundary width in each @xmath8 plane",

    "this number is averaged over all the @xmath8 planes .",
    "the result is then averaged over @xmath55 independent realizations of the quenched randomness .",

    "the different curves are for different interaction anisotropies @xmath9 . in the lower panel for pinning - center impurity , the domain boundary roughens with the introduction of infinitesimal impurity , for all anisotropies :",

    "we find ( figs . 2 and 3 ) that the systems saturate to the @xmath23 `` solid - on - solid '' limit @xcite .",

    "note that the average magnetization magnitude curve of the isotropic case constitutes an upper boundary to the curves of the anisotropic cases for the missing bonds system ( upper panel ) .",
    "the average magnetization magnitude curve of the isotropic case constitutes a lower boundary to the curves of the anisotropic cases for the pinning center system ( lower panel ) .",
    "this is understandable by the fact that missing bonds weaken the connectivity and therefore the magnetization of the system , whereas pinning centers constitute a strong aligning field to their neighboring spins . in curves in the lower panel ,",
    "the deviation from the isotropic case is symmetric , so that each curve corresponds to two values of the anisotropy @xmath9 which are above and below the isotropic case @xmath30 . ]",
    "a bunching of the curves is visible , in the domain - boundary width curves in fig .",
    "2 , especially in the upper panel for missing - bond impurity . this corresponds to a thresholded domain boundary roughening , controlled by the interaction anisotropy .",
    "this effect is also visible in fig .",
    "3 , by the steps in the curves which give the domain boundary widths as a function of the interaction anisotropy @xmath9 for different impurity concentrations @xmath10 , at temperature @xmath2 .",
    "we have checked that our results are robust with respect to varying the number of independent realizations of the quenched randomness .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "thresholded domain boundary roughening can be understood by considering the effect of increasing the anisotropy .",
    "we first discuss the case of missing - bond impurity . upon increasing @xmath60 , for what value of @xmath60 will a spin flip , _",
    "e.g. _ , from + 1 to -1 , thereby increasing the domain boundary width ( directly and/or by inducing a flip cascade ) ?",
    "increasing @xmath60 can flip a spin and increase the width only if one of its bonds in the @xmath61 direction is missing and the non - missing bond connects to a -1 spin .",
    "this flip will then happen for @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are the numbers of @xmath64 neighbors bonded to the flipping spin that are respectively + 1 , -1 .",
    "the possible values are @xmath65 , giving the threshold values of @xmath66 , in fact calculationally seen in the top panels of figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "furthermore , the simultaneous flip of two neighboring spins gives the threshold value of @xmath67 , also calculationally seen in the top panels of figs .",
    "2 and 3 . beyond @xmath67 ,",
    "the system saturates to the @xmath68 `` solid - on - solid '' limit @xcite , exhibiting a single universal curve for the domain boundary width as a function of impurity concentration , for all @xmath34 .",
    "we now discuss the case of pinned - site impurity .",
    "we again consider the effect of increasing @xmath60 and investigate the value of @xmath60 that will flip the spin , _",
    "e.g. _ , from + 1 to -1 , thereby increasing the domain boundary width ( again , directly and/or by inducing a flip cascade ) . increasing @xmath60 can flip this spin only if both of its neighbors in the @xmath61 direction are -1 , with one of these being part of a disconnected island seeded by a pinning center .",
    "this flip will then happen for @xmath69 , where again @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the numbers of @xmath64 neighbors bonded to the flipping spin that are respectively + 1 and -1 .",
    "the possible values are @xmath72 , giving the threshold values of @xmath20 , calculationally seen in the bottom panels of figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "beyond @xmath73 , the system saturates to the @xmath23 `` solid - on - solid '' limit @xcite , exhibiting a single universal curve for the domain boundary width as a function of impurity concentration , for all @xmath25 .    on a similar vein , in the limit of @xmath64 planes",
    "weakly coupled due to low @xmath9 and high concentration of missing bonds , the domain boundary gains by the intermediacy of sending overhangs in the lateral @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions , eventually covering the whole system via randomly magnetized @xmath64 planes . in this case , the spin is flipped by the effect of @xmath74 upon decreasing @xmath60 .",
    "this flip occurs at @xmath69 , where @xmath63 has to be such that @xmath9 is low .",
    "thus , @xmath75 .",
    "( other pairs of values , ( 3,0 ) and ( 1,0 ) do not contribute to this spread of overhangs . ) indeed , in fig .",
    "3 , a rise in the domain for decreasing @xmath76 is seen at high missing bond concentration .    the curves in fig . 3 are domain boundary widths that are affected by complicated ( due to the random geometric distribution of the impurities ) cascades of flips of groups of spins , occurring continuously as the interaction anisotropy is changed .",
    "the arguments given above are for single - spin flips , which strongly affect the boundary width at the specific anisotropy ratios .",
    "we note that since in this system the interactions acting on a given spin @xmath77 can be competing , due to the presence of the interface or of a neighboring pinning center , all of the local magnetizations @xmath78 , where the averaging is thermal , are not saturated even at low temperatures .",
    "such an effect has been seen down to zero temperature in other systems with competing interactions , as for example shown in fig .",
    "@xcite . in our present study ,",
    "the calculated magnitudes of the local magnetizations averaged across our current system , @xmath79 , are given in fig . 5 and show this unsaturation",
    "the effects of quenched random pinning centers and missing bonds on the interface of isotropic and uniaxially anisotropic ising models in @xmath1 have been investigated by hard - spin mean - field theory .",
    "we find that the frozen impurities cause domain boundary roughening that exhibits consecutive thresholding transitions as a function interaction of anisotropy @xmath9 .",
    "the numerical results , showing the thresholding transitions as the bunching of domain boundary width versus impurity concentration curves ( fig .",
    "2 ) and steps in the domain boundary width versus anisotropy curves ( fig .",
    "3 ) agree with our spin - flip arguments at the interface .",
    "the threshold effect should be fully observable in experimental magnetic samples with good crystal structure and point impurities . for both missing - bond and pinning - center impurities , for moderately",
    "large values of @xmath9 , the systems saturate to the @xmath68 `` solid - on - solid '' limit , thus exhibiting a single universal curve for the domain boundary width as a function of impurity concentration , onwards from all moderately large values of @xmath9 .",
