    "advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) have been studied by many authors during recent years ( e.g. , abramowicz et al . 1988 ; narayan & yi 1994 ; chen 1995 ; narayan , kato & honma 1997 ) .",
    "a key feature of radiatively inefficient accretion flows is that radiative energy losses are small so that most of the energy is advected with the gas .",
    "however , advection - dominated accretion flows can occur in two regimes , depending on the accretion rate and the optical depth .",
    "when the accretion rate is high , the optical depth becomes very high and the radiation is trapped in the gas .",
    "these kinds of solutions which are known under the name slim accretion disk have been studied in detail by abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . on other hand ,",
    "we may have optically thin accretion flows with very low mass accretion rate ( e.g. , rees et al . 1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 ; abramowitz et al .",
    "1995 ; chen 1995 ) .    because of the complexity of the equations , similarity technique can help us to explore the relevant physics of radiatively inefficient accretion flows .",
    "as long as we are not interested in the boundaries of the problem , such solutions that describe the behavior of the flow in an intermediate region far from the radial boundaries .",
    "originally , narayan & yi ( 1994 ) studied optically thin advection - dominated accretion disk using their self - similar solutions .",
    "they speculated , on the basic of some numerical calculations , that the self - similar solution is the natural state for an advection - dominated flow .",
    "subsequent analysis ( e.g. , narayan , kato & honma 1997 ) showed that the global solutions achieve approximate self - similar behavior within a short distance from the outer boundary and the approach to self - similarity is quite impressive . considering these achievements , wang & zhou ( 1999 ) constructed self - similar solutions for optically _ thick _ advection dominated accretion flow , in which photon trapping and advection dominate over surface diffusion cooling and used these to explore its different properties from optically thin self - similar solutions .",
    "however , both solutions have the same power index of radius .",
    "a remarkable problem arises when the accretion disk is threaded by magnetic field .",
    "there are good reasons for believing that magnetic fields are important to the physics of accretion disk .",
    "schwartzman ( 1971 ) was the first to point out the importance of the magnetic field in an accretion process .",
    "he proposed a hypothesis of equipartition between the magnetic and kinetic energy densities and this picture is usually accepted in the modern picture of viscous adaf models .",
    "bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace ( 2000 ) suggested that recent papers discussing adaf as a possible solution for astrophysical accretion should be treated with caution , particularly because of ignorance of the magnetic field . while they obtained a solution for a time - averaged magnetic field in a quasispherical accretion flow , an analysis of energy dissipation and equipartition between magnetic and flow energies has been presented ( bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 2000 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of _ magnetized _ , radiatively inefficient flows have been done recently by several authors ( e.g. , machida , matsumoto & mineshige 2001 ; igumenshchev , narayan & abramowicz 2003 ) . however , in most of these the resistive terms in the mhd equations have been neglected , or the resistivity has been considered only in the induction equation without accounting the corresponding dissipation in the energy equation .",
    "some authors tried to study magnetized accretion flow analytically .",
    "for example , kaburaki ( 2000 ) presented a set of analytical solutions for a fully advective accretion flow in a global magnetic field and the conductivity is assumed to be constant for simplicity .",
    "shadmehri ( 2004 ) extended this analysis by considering non - constant resistivity .",
    "he obtained a set of self - similar solutions in spherical coordinates that describes quasi - spherical magnetized accretion flow .",
    "lai ( 1998 ) and lee ( 1999 ) calculated transonic disk accretion flows around a weekly magnetized neutron star , where it was assumed the disk is fully advective . while lee ( 1999 ) considered both the thermal and the radiation pressures , lai ( 1998 ) assumed the radiation pressure dominates over the gas pressure .    in this study",
    ", we present self - similar solutions of an idealized height - integrated set of equations that describe magnetized radiation - dominated accretion flow .",
    "in fact , this analysis extends self - similar solutions of wang & zhou ( 1999 ) for optically thick advection - dominated accretion flow to the magnetized case . for a steady state disk",
    ", there can be a final , steady configuration of magnetic field , in which the inward dragging of field lines by the disk is balanced everywhere by the outward movement of filed lines due to magnetic diffusivity .",
    "we show that the radial structure of a magnetized radiation - dominated accretion flow does not differ from the non - magnetic solutions .",
    "but we can see significantly different behaviors , because of the effects of the magnetic fields .",
    "the equations of the model are presented in the second section .",
    "we obtain and solve the set of self - similar equations analytically in the third section .",
    "for a set of illustrative parameters the solutions will be discussed in this section .",
    "we employ a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath0 centered on a central object ( e.g. , a black hole ) with mass @xmath1 which accretes matter at a steady state @xmath2 from a geometrically thin axisymmetric accretion disk in steady state threaded by an ordered magnetic field .",
    "our model generalize the usual slim disks around black holes ( e.g. , muchotrzeb & paczyski 1982 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "1984 ; abramowicz et al . 1988 ) by including the effect of magnetic fields .",
    "general relativistic effects are neglected and outside of the disk , dissipative effects are assumed to be negligible . for the magnetic field geometry , we are following a general approach presented by lovelace , romanova & newman 1994 ( hereafter lrn ) , in which even filed symmetry is assumed so that @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , we note that the solution for the magnetic field outside of disk should match to the field solution inside the disk at its surface .",
    "but our model does not present a self - consistent model for the magnetic field outside of the disk . in analogy to lrn ,",
    "we parameterize the magnetic field outside of the disk .",
    "also , it is assumed that the accreting matter is confined to a thin disk , and we do not formally introduce a magnetosphere into our model .",
    "the basic equations are integrated over the vertical thickness of the disk .",
    "the mass continuity equation takes the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radial velocity and @xmath8 is surface density of the disk .",
    "the half - thickness is denoted by @xmath9 , where we consider the magnetic field effect on the disk thickness .",
    "we will see that the disk can be compressed or flattened depending on the field configuration .",
    "also , we note that since the radial velocity is negative for accretion ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) , the accretion rate @xmath2 as an input parameter of our model is positive .",
    "the radial momentum equation reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the integrated disk pressure .",
    "we consider an extreme case in which the radiation pressure dominates over the gas pressure and the generated energy is balanced by the advection cooling .",
    "the first assumption implies @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is black body constant and @xmath15 denotes the midplane temperature of the disk .",
    "the energy equation is written based on the second assumption .",
    "the last term of equation ( [ eq : rcom ] ) represents the height integrated radial magnetic force which can be written as ( lrn ) @xmath16\\ ] ] @xmath17+\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\frac{dh}{dr}(b_{\\varphi}^{2}+b_{\\rm z } ^{2}-b_{\\rm r}^{2})_{\\rm h},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , and the @xmath9 subscript denotes that the quantity is evaluated at the upper disk plane , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , integration over @xmath20 of the azimuthal equation of motion gives    @xmath21+\\int f_{\\varphi}^{\\rm mag } dz,\\label{eq : phicom}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 @xmath23.\\ ] ] here , the last term of equation ( [ eq : phicom ] ) represents the height integrated toroidal component of magnetic force . note that this form of azimuthal equation of motion is not exactly similar to the original slim disk model ( e.g. , abramowicz et al . 1988 ) , in which the well - know @xmath24 prescription of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) has been used as a general approximate form for the @xmath25 component of the viscous stress tensor ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "here , we replaced @xmath24 prescription by a diffusive viscosity prescription , i.e. @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the density , @xmath29 is a kinematic viscosity coefficient , and @xmath30 is the angular velocity of matter in the disk .",
    "the above prescription leads to equation ( [ eq : phicom ] ) . in our model",
    ", we also assume @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the local sound speed and @xmath33 is a constant less than unity .",
    "the @xmath20 component of equation of motion gives the condition for vertical hydrostatic balance , which can be written as ( lovelace et al .",
    "1987 ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the keplerian velocity and @xmath36}{4\\pi\\sigma v_{\\rm k}^2}.\\ ] ] now , we can treat the internal magnetic field using the induction equation .",
    "lrn showed that the variation of @xmath37 with @xmath20 within the disk is negligible for even field symmetry .",
    "moreover , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are odd functions of @xmath20 and consequently @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus , @xmath42 @xmath43 and the induction equation reads @xmath44 where the magnetic diffusivity @xmath45 has the same units as kinematic viscosity .",
    "we assume that the magnitude of @xmath45 is comparable to that of the turbulent viscosity @xmath29 ( e.g. , bisnovatyi - kogan & ruzmaikin 1976 ; shadmehri 2004 ) .",
    "exactly in analogy to alpha prescription for @xmath29 , we are using a similar form for the magnetic diffusivity @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant .",
    "note that @xmath45 is _ not _ constant and depends on the physical variables of the flow , and in our self - similar solutions , as we will show , @xmath45 scales with radius as a power law .",
    "this form of scaling for diffusivity has been widely used by many authors ( e.g. , lovelace , wang & sulkanen 1987 ; lrn ; ogilvie & livio 2001 ; rdiger & shalybkov 2002 ) .",
    "while equation ( [ eq : induction ] ) describes transport of a large - scale magnetic field ( here , @xmath48 ) , the values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are determined by the filed solutions external to the disk .",
    "instead , we are following approach of lnr , in which the external field solutions obey the relations @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are constants of order unity ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "thus , one can simply show that @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    to close the equations of our model , we can write the energy equation describing the thermal state of the flow as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the specific entropy ( per unit mass ) and @xmath15 is midplane temperature of the disk . for the heating term , we may have two sources of dissipation : the viscous and resistive dissipations due to a turbulence cascade .",
    "so , @xmath60 and @xmath61 represent viscous dissipation due to the radial motion and the joule heating rate , respectively , @xmath62 and @xmath63\\ ] ]    now we have constructed our model and the main equations of the model are equations ( [ eq : masscon ] ) , ( [ eq : rcom ] ) , ( [ eq : phicom ] ) , ( [ eq : zcom ] ) , ( [ eq : induction ] ) and ( [ eq : energy ] ) . in the next section , we will present self - similar solutions of these equations .",
    "the equations of our model are reduced to standard equations of the slim disk , if we set all the magnetic terms equal to zero .",
    "as we discussed , we are considering a radiation - dominated disk , in which the gas pressure has been neglected comparing to the radiation pressure .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations we get to the following set of self - similar solutions : @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 provide convenient units with which the equations can be written in non - dimensional form .",
    "thus , we obtain the following system of dimensionless equations , to be solved for @xmath14 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 :    @xmath77    @xmath78e^{2},\\ ] ]    @xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is nondimensional mass accretion rate . thus , our input parameters are @xmath33 , @xmath47 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath84 .",
    "we will present values of the physical quantities in non - dimensional form .    in the limit of nonmagnetic case",
    ", the above equations can be solved analytically : @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 the second relation in each equation refers to the limit @xmath90 .",
    "the scaling of our solutions are different from wang & zhou ( 1999 ) who analyzed self - similar solution of optically thick advection - dominated flows . because they applied @xmath24 prescription for viscous stress tensor , but a diffusive prescription has been used in our model , i.e. equation ( [ eq : vis ] ) .",
    "the above nonmagnetic solutions show that the surface density increases with accretion rate , and decreases inversely with @xmath33 . however , the radial velocity is directly proportional to the viscosity coefficient @xmath33 .",
    "the gas rotates with sub - keplerian angular velocity , i.e. @xmath91 . note that except for the surface density and the pressure , the other physical quantities are independent of the accretion rate but depend only on the viscosity coefficient @xmath33 .",
    "an interesting feature is that the opening angle of the disk is fixed @xmath92 , independent of @xmath33 and of the mass accretion rate @xmath84 .",
    "although the radial scaling of the solutions are similar to the nonmagnetic case , we can see significant differences because of the magnetic field effect .",
    "the first important effect of the magnetic field on the disk structure is a squeezing effect , where the scale height @xmath9 is reduced comparing to the nonmagnetic case .",
    "in fact , the squeezing effect of the large - scale magnetic field counterbalances the thickening of the disk generated by advection .",
    "figure 1 shows the behaviour of physical disk quantities as a function of @xmath52 , for three different values of @xmath93 .",
    "the other input parameters are assumed as @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "generally , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are parameters of order unity , however , we consider @xmath53 around unity but changing @xmath52 from 0.5 to 1.2 . for these input parameters ,",
    "the surface density significantly reduces from @xmath97 to a value between 25 and 45 depending on the magnetic field configuration .",
    "however , as @xmath53 increases , the surface density slightly increases for a fixed @xmath52 .",
    "the rotation velocity is below keplerian and as @xmath52 increases , the rotation rate reaches to a maximum and then decreases . also , the radial velocity increases with @xmath52 or @xmath53 , however , is significantly below free - fall velocity . but",
    "comparing to the nonmagnetic solution , the magnetic field tends to increase the radial velocity .",
    "for example , the above input parameters gives @xmath98 for nonmagnetic flow , but the field causes @xmath73 increases to a value between @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "magnetic field causes the opening angle of the disk decreases .",
    "figure 2 is the same as figure 1 , but with lower viscosity coefficient , i.e. @xmath101 .",
    "we see this decrease of @xmath33 causes the surface density increases .",
    "while the radial velocity decreases with @xmath33 , the rotation velocity becomes closer to the keplerian rate .",
    "we see that the opening angle of disk for @xmath101 is smaller than @xmath96 . generally , the physical quantities are sensitive to the viscosity coefficient @xmath33 .",
    "we repeated the above calculations for @xmath102 and found that the solutions weakly change because of the variations of @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in this case , the solutions are qualitatively similar to figures 1 and 2 , but the scaling is somewhat different . for example , for these input parameters , we find the ratio of @xmath103 between @xmath104 and @xmath105 depending on @xmath52 and @xmath53 . regarding to figure 1 which is for @xmath106 , we can say as the resisitivity coefficient @xmath107 decreases , the dependence of solutions on the outside field solutions becomes weaker .",
    "the nonmagnetic solutions show that the rotational and the radial velocity and the opening angle are independent of the mass accretion rate . this result is valid even in magnetic case , as we found by changing the accretion rate and keeping other input parameters constant .",
    "although investigating the behavior of the magnetic field and associated currents within the disk was not the main purpose of our study , we studied the effect of a large - scale magnetic field with open field lines on the structure of an optically thick accretion disk . while the field outside of the disk treated in a phenomenological way , we solved the height - averaged mhd equations self - consistently using similarity technique in analogy to the original study of optically thin adaf by narayan & yi ( 1994 ) .",
    "our self - similar solutions reduce to the nonmagnetic solutions of wang & zhou ( 1999 ) for optically thick advection - dominated accretion flow .",
    "the disk structure and the field geometry are closely linked .",
    "the magnetic field is dragged by the accreting flow , however , the field tends to squeeze the disk and to increase the radial velocity .",
    "the angular velocity of the flow is less than the local keplerian angular velocity by a factor which depends on the magnetic field configuration .",
    "our simple self - similar solutions show that the effect of the magnetic field can not be ignored in a realistic accretion model .",
    "the present solutions may be applied to the x - ray galactic and extragalactic sources , when the accretion rate is high and radiation dominated regime takes place .",
    "the emergent spectrum of such a disk can be calculated using our magnetized self - similar solutions and considering the energy transfer in the vertical direction .",
    "we will discuss this problem in future ."
