    "these lecture notes were written for the american mathematical society ( ams ) short course on quantum computation held 17 - 18 january 2000 in conjunction with the annual meeting of the ams in washington , dc in january 2000 .",
    "the notes are intended for readers with some mathematical background but with little or no exposure to quantum mechanics .",
    "the purpose of these notes is to provide such readers with enough material in quantum mechanics and quantum computation to begin reading the vast literature on quantum computation , quantum cryptography , and quantum information theory .",
    "the paper was written in an informal style .",
    "whenever possible , each new topic was begun with the introduction of the underlying motivating intuitions , and then followed by an explanation of the accompanying mathematical finery .",
    "hopefully , once having grasped the basic intuitions , the reader will find that the remaining material easily follows .",
    "since this paper is intended for a diverse audience , it was written at varying levels of difficulty and sophistication , from the very elementary to the more advanced .",
    "a large number of examples have been included .",
    "an index and table of contents are provided for those readers who prefer to `` pick and choose . ''",
    "hopefully , this paper will provide something of interest for everyone .    because of space limitations , these notes are , of necessity , far from a complete overview of quantum mechanics .  for example ,",
    "only finite dimensional hilbert spaces are considered , thereby avoiding the many pathologies that always arise when dealing with infinite dimensional objects .",
    "many important experiments that are traditionally part of the standard fare in quantum mechanics texts ( such as for example , the stern - gerlach experiment , young s two slit experiment , the aspect experiment ) have not been mentioned in this paper .",
    "we leave it to the reader to decide if these notes have achieved their objective .",
    "the final version of this paper together with all the other lecture notes of the ams  short course on quantum computation will be published as a book in the ams  psapm series entitled `` quantum computation . ''",
    "since one of the objectives of this paper is to discuss quantum information , we begin with a brief discussion of classical information .",
    "the shannon bit is so well known in our age of information that it needs little , if any , introduction .  as we all know , the shannon bit is like a very decisive individual .",
    "it is either 0 or 1 , but by no means both at the same time .",
    "the shannon bit has become so much a part of our every day lives that we take many of its properties for granted .",
    "for example , we take for granted that shannon bits can be copied .      throughout this paper",
    "the quantum polarization states of light will be used to provide concrete illustrations of underlying quantum mechanical principles .",
    "so we also begin with a brief discussion of polarized light from the classical perspective .",
    "light waves in the vacuum are transverse electromagnetic ( em ) waves with both electric and magnetic field vectors perpendicular to the direction of propagation and also to each other .",
    "( see figure 1 . )",
    "fig1.ps + figure 1 . a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave .",
    "if the electric field vector is always parallel to a fixed line , then the em wave is said to be * linearly polarized*. if the electric field vector rotates about the direction of propagation forming a right-(left-)handed screw , it is said to be * right * ( * left * ) * elliptically * * polarized*. if the rotating electric field vector inscribes a circle , the em wave is said to be right - or left-*circularly polarized*.",
    "many of us may not be as familiar with the quantum bit of information , called a * qubit*.  unlike its sibling rival , the shannon bit , the qubit can be both 0 and 1 at the same time .  moreover , unlike the shannon bit , the qubit can not be duplicated .",
    "as we shall see , qubits are like very slippery , irascible individuals , exceedingly difficult to deal with .",
    "one example of a qubit is a spin @xmath0 particle which can be in a spin - up state @xmath1 which we label as `` @xmath2 '' , in a spin - down state @xmath3 which we label as `` @xmath4 '' , or in a * superposition * * * of these states , which we interpret as being both @xmath4 and @xmath2 at the same time .",
    "( the term `` superposition '' will be explained shortly . )",
    "another example of a qubit is the polarization state of a photon .",
    "a photon can be in a vertically polarized state @xmath5 .",
    "we assign a label of `` @xmath2 '' to this state",
    ".  it can be in a horizontally polarized state @xmath6 .",
    "we assign a label of `` @xmath4 '' to this state . or",
    ", it can be in a superposition of these states . in this case",
    ", we interpret its state as representing both @xmath4 and @xmath2 at the same time .",
    "anyone who has worn polarized sunglasses is familiar with the polarization states of light .",
    "polarized sunglasses eliminate glare by letting through only vertically polarized light , while filtering out the horizontally polarized light .  for that reason ,",
    "they are often used to eliminate road glare , i.e. , horizontally polarized light reflected from the road .",
    "but where do qubits live ?  they live in a hilbert space @xmath7 .  by a hilbert space ,",
    "we mean :    a * hilbert space * @xmath7 is a vector space over the complex numbers @xmath8 with a complex valued inner product @xmath9 which is complete with respect to the norm @xmath10 induced by the inner product .     by a complex valued inner product , we mean a map @xmath9 from @xmath11 into the complex numbers @xmath8 such that :    * @xmath12 if and only if @xmath13 * @xmath14 * @xmath15 * @xmath16    where ` @xmath17 ' denotes the complex conjugate .",
