    "light , color - singlet technipions , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are expected to occur in models of multiscale technicolor @xcite and topcolor - assisted technicolor  @xcite .",
    "these technipions will be resonantly produced via technivector meson dominance at substantial rates at the tevatron and the large hadron collider  @xcite .",
    "the technivector mesons in question are an isotriplet of color - singlet @xmath0 and the isoscalar partner @xmath1 .",
    "because techni - isospin is likely to be a good approximate symmetry , @xmath0 and @xmath1 should have equal masses as do the various technipions .",
    "the enhancement of technipion masses due to walking technicolor  @xcite suggest that the channels @xmath10 and @xmath11 are closed .",
    "thus , the decay modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are longitudinal weak bosons , and @xmath16 may dominate  @xcite .",
    "we assume in this paper that @xmath9 decays into @xmath17 .",
    "these heavy flavors , plus an isolated lepton or photon , provide the main signatures for these processes .",
    "we present simulations of @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the tevatron collider with @xmath20 and an integrated luminosity of @xmath21 . for @xmath22 and @xmath6 , cross sections at the tevatron",
    "are expected to be several picobarns .",
    "the narrowness of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances suggests topological cuts that enhance the signal - to - background ratio . for the cross sections we assume in this paper",
    ", the signals stand out well above the background once a single @xmath23-tag is also required .",
    "although we do not simulate these processes for the lhc , cross sections there are an order of magnitude larger than at the tevatron , so detection of the light technihadrons should be easy .",
    "we focus first on @xmath0 production and decay and take up the @xmath1 later .",
    "@xcite , we assumed that there is just one light isotriplet and isoscalar of color - singlet technihadrons and used a simple model of technirho production and decay to determine the rates of the processes @xmath25 and their dependence on @xmath26 .",
    "we found that the most important processes were those with positive @xmath27 ( sum of final - state masses ) _ and _ the fewest number of longitudinal weak bosons . for @xmath28 and @xmath6 ,",
    "the dominant processes have cross sections of 110  pb at the tevatron and 10100  pb at the lhc .",
    "the @xmath29-values of the processes that dominate production typically are less than 3040  gev .",
    "technipion production at hadron colliders is based on a vector - meson - dominance model .",
    "the subprocess cross sections for a pair of technipions @xmath30 , including longitudinal weak bosons , are @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath33 is the subprocess center - of - mass energy , @xmath34 is the technipion momentum , and @xmath35 is the @xmath36 production angle in the subprocess c.m .  frame . ignoring kobayashi - maskawa mixing angles ,",
    "the factors @xmath37 are ( for @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) [ eq : afactors ] & a_i^ ( ) & = 1 ( ) ^2 , +   + & a_i^0 ( ) & = _ il ( ) ^2 + _ ir ( ) ^2 ; +   + & _ il ( ) & = q_i + 2 2 ( t_3i - q_i ^2 ) ( ) , + & _ ir ( ) & = q_i - 2 q_i 2 ^ 2 ( ) . here , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the electric charge and third component of weak isospin for ( left - handed ) quarks  @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the energy - dependent width @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trhocross ] ) is given by the sum of the @xmath0 partial widths to technipions @xmath30 and to fermion pairs @xmath45 .",
    "the former is @xmath46 where the coupling @xmath47 is naively scaled from qcd . in calculations , we take the number of technicolors to be @xmath48 .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 depends on a mixing angle @xmath50 and is given by  @xcite [ eq : ccab ] ^2_ab & = \\",
    "{ ^4 & for w_l^+ w_l^- w_l^z_l^0 + ^2 ^ 2 & for w_l^+ , w_l^- w_l^ , z_l^0 + ^4 & for .",
    "note that , for a given technirho , @xmath51 .",
    "we take @xmath52 in our calculations .",
    "the @xmath0 are _ very _ narrow , @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "the decay rates of the @xmath0 to fermion - antifermion states are even smaller and are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( 1 ) for color - triplet ( singlet ) final - state fermions ; @xmath57 is the momentum and @xmath58 the mass of fermion @xmath59 .",
    "we focus on technirho decay modes with the best signal - to - background ratios , namely , @xmath12 or @xmath13 . for definiteness , we assume @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "technipion couplings to fermions are expected to be proportional to mass .",
    "we adhere to that expectation in this paper and assume that technipions decay as [ eq : singdecay ] & b b + & c b c s , ^+ _ .",
    "thus , heavy - quark jet tagging is an important aid to technipion searches .",
    "we have used pythia  6.1  @xcite to generate @xmath62 with @xmath63 at the tevatron collider with @xmath64 .",
    "the cross section for this process is @xmath65 .",
    "we also used pythia to generate the @xmath66 background .",
    "jets were found using the clustering code provided in pythia with a cell size of @xmath67 , a cone radius @xmath68 and a minimum jet @xmath69 of 5 gev .",
    "cell energies were smeared using a calorimeter resolution of @xmath70 .",
    "missing transverse energy @xmath71 was then calculated as : @xmath72 selected events were required to have an isolated electron or muon , large missing energy , and two or more jets .",
    "the selection criteria were :    * lepton : @xmath73 ; pseudorapidity @xmath74 . * missing energy : @xmath75 . *",
    "transverse mass : @xmath76 . * two or more jets with @xmath77 and @xmath78 , separated from the lepton by at least @xmath79 .    requiring that the lepton and jets be central in pseudorapidity",
    "exploits the fact that the signal events will tend to be produced with larger center - of - mass scattering angles than the background .",
    "figure  1(a ) shows the invariant mass distribution of the two highest-@xmath69 jets for the signal ( black ) and background ( grey ) events passing these criteria for a luminosity of @xmath21 , half that expected in tevatron run  ii .",
    "the peculiar kinematics of @xmath12 and @xmath13 suggest other cuts that can discriminate signals from the @xmath80 backgrounds . at the tevatron",
    ", signal events will be more central there . cutting harder on rapidity for lhc events will improve signal - to - background ; the higher cross section and luminosity at the lhc leave plenty of events . ]",
    "the small @xmath29-values for @xmath0 decays causes the @xmath81 and @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) to have low transverse momenta , @xmath82 for our reference masses .",
    "not only is the @xmath83 of the dijet system limited , but the jets are emitted with an opening azimuthal angle @xmath84 .",
    "these expectations were borne out by simulated distributions in these variables .",
    "cutting on the maximum and minimum @xmath85 and the minimum @xmath86 help suppress the @xmath87 background to @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , we have taken the selected events in fig .",
    "1(a ) and applied the additional topological cuts @xmath88 and @xmath89 these cuts reject 78% of the @xmath90 background while retaining 64% of the signal .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "for the signal cross section of @xmath65 , the signal - to - background at @xmath91 is improved from 0.04 to 0.11 by these cuts .",
    "a signal rate in excess of @xmath92 would produce a visible excess at this level .",
    "the additional effect of tagging one @xmath23-jet per event is shown in fig .",
    "we have assumed a 50% efficiency for tagging @xmath23 s , a 1% probability to mistag light quarks and gluons , and a 17% probability to mistag charm as a @xmath23 .",
    "this final selection leaves a clear dijet resonance signal above the background at just below the mass of the @xmath81 .",
    "for @xmath93 , there are 65  signal events over a background of  35 .",
    "the mass distribution for the signal is almost gaussian , with a peak at @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this width and a tail on the low side are due mainly to the effects of final - state gluon radiation , fragmentation , calorimeter resolution and neutrinos from @xmath23-decay .",
    "figure  1(d ) shows the invariant mass distributions for the @xmath90 system after topological cuts and @xmath23-tagging have been imposed . here",
    "the @xmath96 four - momentum was reconstructed from the lepton and @xmath71 , taking the lower - rapidity solution in each case .",
    "again , a clear peak is visible at just below the mass of the @xmath0 .",
    "we point out that , especially after making the topological cuts , the dijet mass and the @xmath90 mass are highly correlated ; a peak in one distribution is almost bound to correspond to a peak in the other .",
    "thus , the existence of structure in both distributions does not add to the statistical significance of any observation .",
    "we conclude that if @xmath0 and @xmath81 exist in the mass range we consider , they can be found without difficulty in run  ii of the tevatron .",
    "in fact , since there are @xmath97 signal events in fig .",
    "1(c ) for @xmath98 , one might see hints of a signal with one tenth the luminosity .",
    "it is certainly worth looking in the presently accumulated samples of @xmath99 per experiment .",
    "the production cross section at @xmath100 is about 15% lower than at @xmath101 .",
    "other channels may also add to the cross section : for our reference masses , @xmath102 contributes an additional @xmath103 , though only one @xmath23-jet is present in the @xmath8 decay .",
    "we turn now to the signatures for @xmath1 production .",
    "the @xmath1 is produced in hadron collisions just as the @xmath104 , via its vector - meson - dominance coupling to @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "its cross section is proportional to @xmath107 , where @xmath108 are the electric charges of the @xmath1 s constituent technifermions . for @xmath109 , then , the @xmath1 and @xmath110 should be produced at comparable rates , barring accidental cancellations .",
    "if the @xmath10 channels are nearly or fully closed , then @xmath111 certainly is forbidden .",
    "if we can use decays of the ordinary @xmath112 as a guide , @xmath19 , @xmath113 will be much more important than @xmath114  @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to estimate the relative importance of these two modes without an an explicit model , but it seems plausible that @xmath115 will dominate the phase - space - limited @xmath113 channel .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the @xmath116 mode in this paper",
    ". we shall find , surprisingly enough , that the decay modes @xmath117 and @xmath118 decay modes are comparable to @xmath119 .",
    "channel . ]    as for the technirho , the subprocess cross section for @xmath120 production is obtained from a simple vector - meson - dominance model : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the photon momentum .",
    "the factor @xmath123 is given by [ eq : bfactor ] b_i^0 ( ) & = _ il ( ) ^2 + _ ir ( ) ^2 ; +   + _ il ( ) & = ( q_u + q_d ) , +   + _ ir ( ) & = ( q_u + q_d ) .",
    "neglecting @xmath124 , the energy - dependent width @xmath125 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tomegacross ] ) is given by the sum of the partial widths [ eq : tomegadecay ] & ( _ t ) = p^3 , +   + & ( _ t f_i f_i ) = c_f ^2 m^4__t b^0_i ( ) . the mass parameter @xmath126 in the @xmath127 rate is unknown _ a priori _ ; we take it to be @xmath128 in our calculations .",
    "we also took the technifermion charges to be @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and we used @xmath131 and @xmath61 .    note that the decay rate for the @xmath132 mode is @xmath133 and the differential subprocess cross section is nominally of @xmath134 .",
    "nevertheless , the integrated @xmath135 rate will be comparable to the rate for @xmath136 and @xmath137 _ if _ the @xmath132 mode dominates the @xmath1 width .",
    "note also that the two rates in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tomegadecay ] ) are numerically comparable when summed over fermion flavors .",
    "pythia  6.1 @xcite was used to generate @xmath138 with @xmath139 at @xmath140 .",
    "the cross section for this process is @xmath141 .",
    "the background considered is @xmath142 .",
    "selected events were required to have an isolated photon and two or more jets .",
    "the selection criteria were :      figure  2(a ) shows the invariant mass distribution of the two highest-@xmath69 jets for the signal ( black ) and background ( grey ) events passing these criteria for an integrated luminosity of @xmath21 . as for the @xmath0 , backgrounds swamp the signal .",
    "therefore , we have again investigated topological selections which might enhance the signal over the backgrounds . for @xmath144 and @xmath6 , signal events",
    "have @xmath145 and dijet azimuthal angle @xmath146 .",
    "we apply the additional cut @xmath147 to the untagged events of fig .",
    "however , no useful cut can made on @xmath85 since the signal and background have very similar shapes .",
    "the effect of these cuts is seen in fig .",
    "the @xmath148 background is reduced by 61% while 75% of the signal is retained .",
    "tagging one @xmath23-jet further improves the signal / background as shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , and a clear peak just below the @xmath81 mass can be seen .",
    "figure  2(d ) shows the photon@xmath149dijet invariant mass after the topological cuts and @xmath23-tagging are employed .",
    "again , we found that this total invariant mass was not a useful variable to cut on .    in conclusion , we have shown that the low - scale technicolor signatures @xmath150 and @xmath151 can be discovered easily in run  ii of the tevatron for production rates as low as a few picobarns .",
    "low rates require @xmath23-tagging of the @xmath81 .",
    "topological cuts alone  which may be the only handle for technipions decaying to charmed or lighter quark jets  will be sufficient if cross sections exceed 1015  pb . signals with rates this large should be apparent in the existing data .",
    "we urge that they be looked for .",
    "production rates are an order of magnitude higher at the lhc than at the tevatron .",
    "thus , the lhc will be decisive in excluding low - scale technicolor signatures of the type considered here .",
    "we are greatly indebted to torbjorn sjostrand for including the @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes in pythia and for many helpful and stimulating comments .",
