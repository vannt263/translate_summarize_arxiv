    "most recent experiments to search for the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) involve the neutron interacting with electric fields created by laboratory apparatus .",
    "however there is also the possibility of using electric fields produced by atoms in crystals .",
    "there are some reasons for believing this might be advantageous ",
    "atomic fields are large and the neutrons interact with many atoms in a coherent fashion .",
    "however as we will show the measurable effects are quite small compared to known background effects due to the motional electric field .",
    "the effect in a crystal experiment can be enhanced if the scatteing amplitude due to the edm interaction can be made to interfere with the much larger scattering amplitude of a nucleus .",
    "it will be seen below that the scattering amplitude due to the edm interaction is imaginary so it can only interfere with an imaginary nuclear amplitude .",
    "the idea of searching for a neutron edm by measuring the interference between the scattering from an atomic electric field ( due to the edm interaction ) with nuclear scattering was proposed by shull ; an experiment was performed in 1964 and was based on scattering from a cds crystal , because cd , a strong absorber , has a large imaginary scattering amplitude.@xcite in this experiment , the penetration depth , hence reflectivity , depends on the orientation of the neutron spin relative to the momentum transfer.@xcite    recently , a proposal to search for a neutron edm by scattering in a perfect si crystal was put forward.@xcite in this case , the imaginary part of the nuclear scattering length is very small , and the proposed observable is a rotation of the neutron spin direction caused by the superpostion of the spin dependent imaginary amplitude with the real nuclear amplitude .    because the calculations regarding this effect do not , to our knowledge , appear in the literature and the calculations regarding the schull experiment are lacking in detail , we felt it worthwhile to estimate the size of a neutron spin rotation due to an edm interaction , and in addition , include the analysis of the @xmath1 interaction originally studied by schwinger @xcite and demonstrated by shull and nathans .",
    "@xcite we use the thomas - fermi model of the atom to give the approximate atomic electric field .",
    "the thomas - fermi model of the atom is fully developed in  70 of @xcite .",
    "briefly , the atom is treated semi - classically with the electron density as a function of position determined by phase space considerations .",
    "this leads to a universal function ( i.e. , it does not depend on atomic number @xmath2 ) for the self - consistent electric field within the atom , @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes the shielding ( assumed spherically symmetric ) of the nuclear point charge , with the boundary conditions that @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( the latter condition determins @xmath7 ) , and the radius @xmath8 is related to @xmath9 as @xmath10 ( where we are using atomic units so @xmath11 ) . the electric potential within an atom is given by @xmath12    we point out that the thomas - fermi model does not apply for either very large or very small @xmath9 ; however , the major contribution to the scattering integral is from @xmath13 , and we would expect this model to give reasonably accurate results .",
    "we are interested in calculating the spin - dependent neutron scattering length by the born approximation for either the @xmath14 field or a neutron permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) .",
    "consider first the edm interaction , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dipole moment length , @xmath17 is the magnitude of the electron charge , @xmath18 is a pauli matrix , and @xmath19 is an electric field .",
    "the scattering amplitude ( length ) can be determined by use of the born approximation , @xmath20 taking the momentum transfer @xmath21 along @xmath22 as the quantization axis , and using the fact that the electric field is spherically symmetric , we find @xmath23 and the other components are zero because of symmetry .",
    "taking @xmath24 , and using the thomas - fermi wavefunction , the scattering length can be written as , taking @xmath25 , @xmath26 e^{ix\\beta q\\cos\\theta}\\cos\\theta\\ \\sin\\theta { \\rm d}x{\\rm d}\\theta\\ ] ] which can be rewritten as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the imaginary part ( the real part is zero ) of the dimensionless integral in the previous equation",
    ". the thomas - fermi equation was numerically solved using a runge - kutta technique , and the integral numerically evaluated .",
    "the results , as a function of @xmath29 , are shown in fig",
    ". 1 .    for the case of si ,",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 ; a typical @xmath32 is approximately @xmath33 giving @xmath34 , and the dimensionless integral is about 1 .",
    "thus , the difference in the scattering length for the two spin states ( along @xmath35 ) is @xmath36 which leads to an spin rotation , on interference with the si nuclear scattering amplitude ( @xmath37 cm ) @xmath38 implying that for @xmath39 cm , a bragg reflection from an si crystal would give a rotation of @xmath40 rad .",
    "next , consider the @xmath1 motional magnetic field interaction which couples to the neutron magnetic moment , which was first considered by schwinger in 1948.@xcite the possibility of measuring effects from the motional field has been discussed in regard to non - centrosymmetric crytals ( @xmath41quartz ) in which case a non - zero average electric field between scattering planes can exist.@xcite however , as has been pointed out , there is a @xmath1 observable even for symmetric crystals.@xcite    the hamiltonian for the @xmath1 interaction is @xmath42/2 .\\ ] ] for the born approximation , we use the matrix element @xmath43 where @xmath44 label the incoming and outgoing neutron wavefunction .",
    "taking @xmath45 with @xmath46 gives @xmath47 again , assume that @xmath48 lies along @xmath49 ; we note that @xmath50 is perpendicular to @xmath51 because @xmath52 for elastic scattering . by symmetry ,",
    "the effective electric field lies along @xmath49 , and if we assume @xmath51 is along @xmath53 and @xmath21 ( and has magnitude @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the scattering angle ) , the born approximation is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the neutron magnetic moment ( -3 hz / mg ) .",
    "thus , the integral is identical to the edm case , with a different multipliative constant , and @xmath58 or a spin rotation about @xmath59 of @xmath60 per bragg reflection from an si crystal .",
    "if we assume there is no electron cloud around the nucleus , in eq .",
    "( 7 ) @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , which is equivalent to the high - momentum limit .",
    "we can estimate the edm effect by taking a classical trajectory with impact parameter @xmath63 relative to the nucleus .",
    "the time - integrated- electric - field - induced phase shift , assuming a spin in the the @xmath22 direction ( propagation in @xmath59 direction ) is given by @xmath64 which is essentially the same as before , in the high momentum limit , if we take @xmath65 .",
    "comparing eqs . ( 10 ) and ( 19 ) , we see that the motional field spin rotation is on the order of @xmath66 times larger than that due to an edm with a magnitude that would be of interest in an improved experiment . unfortunately , the effects can not be switched on and off as in the case of the more conventional experiments based on spin precession in an applied electric field .",
    "although the two scattering effects are proportional to @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively , discrimination between the effects relies on an absolute determination of the polarization and scattering axes .",
    "one can also be concerned with the normal nuclear parity violation , which can combine with a misalignment to produce effects that mimic t - violation .",
    "this and other issues relevant for a realistic edm scattering experiment are similar to those relating to a study of time reversal violating effects in slow neutron transmission through polarized matter for which the issues have been addressed in some detail ; in particular , the constraints on near - perfect field and polarization alignment , and inability to discriminate effects due to misalignments , have been emphasized .",
    "@xcite the scattering angles constraints in a bragg scattering edm experiment are analogous to the constraints on the sample polarization axis in a neutron transmission experiment as discussed in @xcite .",
    "given the constraints ( e.g. , scattering angle and polarization alignment to @xmath69 radian absolute accuracy which requires @xmath70 neutron counts to measure experimentally ) achieving any significant increase in the limit for the neutron edm would seem a daunting task ."
