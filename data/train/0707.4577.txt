    "in 2005 the physicist hirsch @xcite introduced the @xmath1 index as an easily determinable estimate of the impact of a scientist s cumulative research contribution .",
    "the index @xmath1 is defined as the highest number of papers of a scientist that received @xmath1 or more citations .",
    "thus it incorporates both publication quantity and citation quality into a single number , which might be taken as an estimate of the visibility or impact of a scientist s research and might reflect its importance and significance .",
    "it has generally been well received in the physics community @xcite and it is discussed as a convenient measure in evaluations . + the @xmath1 index is robust in the sense that it is insensitive to the number of uncited or lowly cited papers .",
    "this is certainly an advantage compared to other indicators like the average number of citations per paper or the total number of papers . on the other hand , the @xmath1 index is also robust in the sense that it is not sensitive to one or several outstandingly highly cited papers , because once a paper has reached the @xmath1-defining set , it is no more relevant whether or not it is further cited .",
    "this aspect has been considered as a major drawback of the @xmath1 index @xcite .",
    "one way to take into account the performance of the most cited papers would be to determine the average number of citations per  meaningful paper ",
    "@xcite , but then it is ambiguous how to define the threshold .",
    "one possibility would be to use the value @xmath1 @xcite , the result has been labeled @xmath2 index @xcite . thus the performance could be characterized by two values , the @xmath1 index and the @xmath2 index .",
    "a more elegant way to incorporate the evolution of citation counts of highly cited articles into a single number has been proposed by egghe @xcite , defining the @xmath0 index as the highest number of papers that received on average @xmath0 or more citations . in other words , it is the highest number of articles that together received @xmath3 or more citations . by this definition",
    "the usually strongly skewed frequency distribution of the citations increases the score : the higher the number of citations in the top range , the higher the @xmath0 index .",
    "+ the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 has been investigated for some simple models @xcite , it has also been applied to 14 price medalists @xcite . in that paper",
    "the author suggested that it would also be interesting to work out more practical cases ( in other fields ) of @xmath1 and @xmath0 index comparisons .",
    "it is one purpose of the present article to present nine such practical cases in physics .",
    "previous investigations of the hirsch index have determined outstanding values for prominent and highly cited scientists . while these are certainly interesting , they are surely not representative cases .",
    "only one investigation @xcite of the hirsch index analyzed the data of more average scientists , namely average faculty members .",
    "i have chosen the same strategy , analyzing my own publications and those of eight colleagues as described below .",
    "this case study shows that the @xmath0 index better measures the citation records of the authors than the @xmath1 index .",
    "+ the second purpose of the present work is to investigate the influence of self - citations on the @xmath0 index .",
    "self - citations do not reflect the impact of a publication and should therefore not be included in a citation analysis when this is intended to give an assessment of the scientific achievement of a scientist and his visibility @xcite .",
    "earlier studies @xcite have shown that in physical sciences 15 % of all citations were self - citations . in more recent studies",
    "@xcite in physics about 25 % of all citations where identified as self - citations . however , it is not obvious , how strongly these self - citations influence the @xmath0 index .",
    "i have recently @xcite shown that self - citations significantly reduce the @xmath1 index in contrast to hirsch s expectations @xcite . for a group of 7 scientists in ecology and evolution",
    "@xcite the exclusion of self - citations reduced the @xmath1 index on average by 12.3 % .",
    "on the other hand , the average reduction was only 6.6 % for the @xmath1 indices of 31 influential scientists in information science @xcite , with an absolute decrease between zero and three only .",
    "in contrast , my investigation @xcite showed a decrease between two and six , with an average of 3.6 or 23.5 % , when self - citations were excluded .",
    "this is a rather significant effect .",
    "i will show below that the effect is similarly important for the determination of the @xmath0 index , yielding a decrease of the @xmath0 index between one and twelve , with an average of 5.0 or 21.7 % .",
    "it also turned out that the @xmath0 index after exclusion of self - citations allows for a better distinction between the impact of the publications of the different authors .",
    "thus it is superior to the original @xmath0 index , which in turn is superior to the @xmath1 index .",
    "the subsequent analysis is based on data compiled in january and february 2007 from the science citations index , provided by thomson isi in the web of science ( wos ) , taking great care that homographs do not distort the results @xcite . out of self - interest and due to the fact that it is relatively easy to check for homographs and other inaccuracies in one s own publications and citations i first performed a self - experiment and investigated my own citation records ( data set a ) .",
    "then i analyzed the publications of a somewhat older colleague who is working in a more topical field in a mainstream area ( data set b ) .",
    "in contrast , i studied the records of a somewhat younger colleague , working in a less attractive field , who has published fewer papers ( data set c ) and i was surprised that in this case the @xmath0 index was not significantly larger than the @xmath1 index , see below .",
    "this induced me to look at two other data sets ( d and e ) with an even smaller total numbers of publications . in these cases",
    "the ratio @xmath4 turned out to be unexpectedly large , as also shown below .",
    "finally , addressing the concerns of a referee , i have considered four more cases , where f was chosen because it appeared to be similar to d and e , and g , h , i comparable to c. + small deviations of the values for data sets a and b in comparison to the previous study @xcite are due to the fact that the data have been updated for the present investigation .",
    "after ordering the publication list according to the number of citations @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the rank that the ordering has attributed to the article ,    hirsch s index @xmath1 can be easily determined from    @xmath7    or , equivalently , from @xmath8 which reflects the verbal definition above , namely that @xmath1 is given by the highest number of papers which received @xmath1 or more citations .",
    "to determine the @xmath0 index , one has to calculate the sum @xmath9 over the number of citations up to the rank @xmath6 :    @xmath10    then the @xmath0 index is also easy to determine from    @xmath11    or , equivalently , from @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the average number of citations up to rank @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath14 the definition ( 5 ) again reflects the verbal definition above , namely that the @xmath0 index is defined as the highest number of papers which received on average @xmath0 or more citations .",
    "in table 1 some characteristics for the nine data sets are compiled . besides the total number of papers @xmath15 also the number of papers with at least one citation , @xmath16 , is given , because in the general framework of information production processes where the articles are the sources and the citations are the investigated items , only sources with at least one item are usually considered . in citation analysis , on the other hand , of course also uncited articles belong to the data set . but it is certainly interesting to observe how many articles are not cited at all . in the cases which are investigated here ,",
    "between 14 % and 31 % of the papers received no citation .",
    "as well it is interesting to see the highest number of citations for every author , @xmath17 . here the high value @xmath18 for data set d ( the superscript is used to distinguish the data sets .",
    ") is conspicuous in comparison to the relatively small total number of publications . on the other hand",
    ", the value @xmath19 appears to be quite small for a scientist with an overall production of 86 papers .",
    "+    .characteristics for the nine data sets analyzed in the present investigation .",
    "the first column labels the data sets , the following columns give the total number of publications , the number of publications which received at least one citation , the highest citation count , the hirsch index , the total number of citations of all papers up to the hirsch index , the average number of citations for all papers up to the hirsch index , the geometric mean of the hirsch index and the @xmath2 index , the @xmath0 index , the citation count of the first paper that is not included in the @xmath0-defining set , and the ratio of @xmath0 index and @xmath1 index .",
    "+ [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the resulting values for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are given in table 2 .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath0 index is significantly reduced in all cases , the sharpened index @xmath22 is mostly reduced by about 20 % , but in the extreme cases by as much as 53 % and as little as 6 % only , shown by the ratio @xmath23 in table 2 .",
    "a comparison of the values in table 2 with the above given preliminary results for data sets a , c and i as deduced from figure 1 shows that the reordering does have an influence on the results .",
    "the thus caused small changes of the values for the cases a and i is typical , the relatively large changes in case c are due to the unusually large number of self - citations in connection with the relatively small value of the @xmath24 index .",
    "+ table 2 also comprises the values of the sharpened hirsch index @xmath25 and shows the ratio @xmath26 . with a range of 12 % to 46 %",
    "the reduction is of the same order as for the sharpened index @xmath22 .",
    "however , the variance is somewhat higher for @xmath22 than for @xmath25 .",
    "therefore also the ratio @xmath27 between the two sharpened values shows a larger variance ranging from 100 % to 267 % and thus makes a comparison between the authors concerning their visibility clearer .",
    "this becomes even more apparent , when one relates the sharpened value @xmath22 with the original hirsch index : now the ratio @xmath28 yields values between 0.54 and 2.13 .",
    "the coincidence of @xmath29 and @xmath30 appears surprising at a glance , because it seems to indicate the unrealistic exception @xmath31 .",
    "however , this is not the case , rather the equality stems from the fact that we are considering integer values only so that in this particular case a total citation count of @xmath32 yields @xmath33 and not @xmath34 .",
    "nevertheless , the coincidence is an indicator that the citation counts of all manuscripts in the @xmath30-defining set are at or not much above @xmath30 .",
    "the small number of self - citations in data set d is already reflected in the high value @xmath35 , but it becomes even clearer from the ratio @xmath36 being close to unity .",
    "similarly , the other extreme @xmath37 becomes more pronounced in the @xmath0 index ratio @xmath38 .",
    "let me finally point out various observations that can be made by comparing some of the values for different data sets .",
    "for example , my colleague b has written a few more papers than i did , but as he is working in a very topical field , his publications have received significantly more citations as reflected not only in the citation count of the mostly cited paper , but also in the summed number of citations . consequently his hirsch index is significantly larger than mine .",
    "all other indices , in particular @xmath0 , @xmath25 , and @xmath22 , show a very similar behavior for both cases and all the ratios in table 1 and table 2 are quite similar .",
    "+ comparing data sets c and d the total number of citations and the hirsch index give the impression that my colleague c is much more productive than d. however , the sharpened hirsch index is equal for both cases , the @xmath0 index is already smaller for the data set c and the sharpened @xmath0 index makes this distinction even more obvious .",
    "one may conclude that d is more visible than c , although c is more productive than d. + a similar picture can be painted comparing cases e and c. the total number of publications in data set e is very small , so is the hirsch index , although this scientist has already obtained an associate professorship .",
    "certainly the value @xmath39 is much smaller than the value which hirsch has proposed @xcite as a reasonable value for promotion .",
    "it is also much smaller than the already discussed value @xmath40 .",
    "however , table 1 shows that the highest citation counts of these two cases are nearly the same .",
    "this is also true for their @xmath2 indices . comparing the @xmath0 values",
    ", one finds that @xmath41 approaches @xmath24 , which is also reflected in the respective ratios @xmath4 .",
    "the ratios @xmath26 are not so much different , but the ratios @xmath23 are clearly distinct again , reflecting the observation that in the sharpened @xmath0 index the colleague c has been overtaken by e. in the ratio @xmath27 this becomes quite obvious , and it is even more pronounced when one compares the ratios @xmath28 . again the conclusion is that the impact of the research of scientist e is at least comparable , if not larger than that of colleague c. however , due to the small numbers of the indices in these two cases , the relative changes and the relative differences should not be overestimated .",
    "+ comparing data sets f and e , a similar observation can be made : while colleague f appears to be more productive than e with more publications and more visible with a higher @xmath1 index , the relation is reversed when one looks at the @xmath0 index or at the sharpened index @xmath22 .",
    "comparing cases f and c , f appears less productive and less visible , in this case not only by comparing the @xmath1 values but also the @xmath0 values , but this difference is completely balanced in the sharpened values of @xmath22 .",
    "+ the three cases g , h , and i have been selected , because they have approximately the same total number @xmath15 of publications and similar highest citation counts @xmath42 .",
    "it was therefore not surprising , that their @xmath1 indices are equal and that their @xmath0 indices are nearly the same .",
    "however , after the sccs have been taken into account , the resulting @xmath22 values are different and allow a distinction .",
    "the colleague g with most publications ends up with the smallest value @xmath43 , while colleague i with smallest number of cited publications and the smallest @xmath0 index among these three cases still reaches the value @xmath44 .",
    "in conclusion , i have presented a case study of the @xmath0 index as introduced by leo egghe . the comparison with the respective values for the hirsch index confirmed the expectation that the @xmath0 index does indeed incorporate the evolution of the citation counts of highly cited articles , which are not appropriately appreciated in the hirsch index . in principle",
    "the determination of the @xmath0 index is as simple as that of the @xmath1 index , both being single numbers . in practice",
    "it is somewhat more difficult to determine , because it is an integral measure .",
    "+ in addition , the influence of self - citations on the @xmath0 index has been analyzed . as already observed for the hirsch index @xcite the respective corrections",
    "are not insignificant and can drastically reduce the @xmath0 index . sharpening the @xmath0 index by",
    "the exclusion of the self - citations leads to a larger variance of the obtained values and thus allows a clearer distinction of the data sets . +",
    "the expenditure for the data analysis is much larger , when the self - citations are to be determined .",
    "this was mentioned as one reason , why the self - citations had been taken into account only in seven randomly selected cases out of 187 data sets of scientists of ecology and evolution , for which the hirsch index was investigated @xcite .",
    "this expenditure is even much larger for the determination of the @xmath22 index than for the calculation of the @xmath25 index , because now the citation counts of all manuscripts at least up to the critical rank @xmath0 have to be analyzed and not only the self - citations for the manuscripts with a rank in the neighborhood of the hirsch index @xmath1 . on the other hand , while small errors can easily change the hirsch index @xmath1 , this is usually not the case for the @xmath0 index , because of its integral character .",
    "this has become clear , when the manuscripts were reordered by the number of their citations after excluding the self - citations and when this reordering did not have a significant influence while such a reordering is essential for the sharpening of the hirsch index @xcite .",
    "+ in conclusion , the present study corroborates the superiority of the @xmath0 index as compared to the @xmath1 index .",
    "it also confirms that self - citations can be very significant and should be excluded , thus sharpening the @xmath0 index and its merit .",
    "i thank a. clauner and c. schreiber for tedious work in establishing the data base ."
