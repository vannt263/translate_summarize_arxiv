    "the hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model @xcite describes the motion of @xmath1 classical rotors coupled through a mean - field interaction . the system , in its standard formulation , can be straightforwardly modified to include an external perturbation that acts on the particles as a magnetic - like field @xcite . the model is mathematically defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath3 - h\\sum_{j=1}^n\\cos(\\theta_j),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 represents the orientation of the @xmath5-th rotor and @xmath6 is its angular momentum .",
    "the scalar parameter @xmath0 measures the strength of the magnetic field",
    ". hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) with @xmath7 has been widely studied in the past as a prototype model of long - range interacting systems . to monitor the dynamics of the systems",
    ", one often refers to the magnetization , a collective variable defined as @xmath8 the modulus of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , measures the degree of bunching of the rotors along a given direction .",
    "the model can be also interpreted as describing @xmath1 particles moving on a circle . within this interpretation",
    ", magnetized regimes signal the presence of a localized agglomeration of particles on the circle .",
    "as previously reported in the literature @xcite , starting from an out - of - equilibrium initial condition , the system gets trapped in long lasting qsss , whose macroscopic characteristics differ significantly from those associated to the corresponding equilibrium configurations",
    ". qsss develop for both @xmath7 and @xmath11 settings . in the @xmath12 limit , the system is indefinitely stuck in the qss phase .",
    "on the other hand , when performing the limit for infinite system size , the discrete model hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) admits a rigorous continuous analogue . this is the vlasov equation which governs the evolution of the single particle distribution function @xmath13 : @xmath14}{d\\theta }     \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p } = 0\\ ; , \\cr      & & \\cr    v[f](\\theta ) & = & 1 - \\left(m_x[f]+h\\right ) \\cos\\theta - m_y[f ] \\sin\\theta\\ ; , \\cr    m_x[f ] & = & \\int d\\theta\\ , dp\\ , f \\cos\\theta \\ ; , \\cr    m_y[f ] & = & \\int d\\theta\\ , dp\\ , f \\sin\\theta\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the interaction potential that depends self - consistently on @xmath16 . according to this kinetic picture the free streaming of the particles",
    "is opposed by a potential term @xmath17 $ ] , reminiscent of the discrete formulation , expressed as a self - consistent function of the dynamically varying distribution @xmath13 .    in light of the above , the qsss have been interpreted as stable steady states of the underlying vlasov equation . working within this setting , and invoking the aforementioned lynden ",
    "bell violent relaxation theory @xcite , one can progress analytically at least for a simplified choice of the initial condition .",
    "a short account of the technicalities is provided in the following section .",
    "assume the particles to be confined within a bounded domain of phase space , therein displaying a uniform probability distribution .",
    "label @xmath18 the constant value of @xmath16 within the selected domain , as imposed by the normalization condition .",
    "this working ansatz corresponds to dealing with the `` waterbag '' distribution : @xmath19 that is even in both @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 . for distributions endowed with this symmetry",
    ", it can be straightforwardly proven that , being @xmath23 initially , its value remains zero during time evolution .",
    "this in turn implies that also the total momentum @xmath24 , which is zero initially , remains zero during the whole time evolution , i.e. there is no global rotation of the particles on the circle . with this choice , one parametrizes the initial condition in terms of the energy density @xmath25 and the initial magnetization @xmath26 .",
    "momentum @xmath27 can not be considered as a global invariant , because the presence of an external magnetic field breaks the translation symmetry @xmath28 . however , for the initial distributions ( [ f_0-hmf ] ) , momentum is fixed to zero .    under the vlasov evolution , the waterbag gets distorted and filamented at smaller scales , while preserving its surface in phase space .",
    "the distribution stays two - level ( @xmath29 ) as time progresses . by performing a local average of @xmath30 inside a given mesoscopic box ,",
    "one gets a coarse - grained profile which is hereafter labelled @xmath31 . as opposed to @xmath30 , the locally averaged function @xmath31 converges to an asymptotic equilibrium solution which can be explicitly evaluated via a rigorous statistical mechanics procedure , adapted from the pioneering analysis of lynden - bell .",
    "an entropy functional @xmath32 , can be in fact associated to @xmath31 , through a direct combinatorial calculation @xcite . in the two - level waterbag scenario ,",
    "the mixing entropy density @xmath33 takes the form : @xmath34=-\\int \\!\\!{\\mathrm d}p{\\mathrm d}\\theta \\ , \\left[\\frac{\\bar{f}}{f_0 } \\ln \\frac{\\bar{f}}{f_0 } + \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{f}}{f_0}\\right)\\ln \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{f}}{f_0}\\right)\\right].\\ ] ] the energy density @xmath35 = \\iint { \\mathrm d}\\theta { \\mathrm d}p \\frac{p^2}{2 } f(\\theta , p , t)+\\frac{1-m_x^2-m_y^2}{2}- h m_x\\ ] ] is conserved .",
    "in addition , the normalization of the distribution @xmath31 has to be imposed , which physically corresponds to assume constant mass . requiring the entropy to be stationary ,",
    "while imposing the conservation of energy and mass , result in a variational problem that admits the following solution : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are lagrange multipliers associated , respectively , to mass and energy conservation and @xmath39 and @xmath40 depend on @xmath41 .",
    "the self - consistent nature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : barf ] ) is evident : @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 $ ] are functionals of @xmath41 and both enter in the determination of @xmath41 itself .",
    "we also emphasize that the label @xmath44 is introduced to recall that the stationary solution of the vlasov equation are indeed associated to qsss of the discrete @xmath1-body dynamics .    back to solution ( [ eq : barf ] ) , one can determine the predicted values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 once the energy @xmath45 , the field @xmath0 and the waterbag height @xmath18 are being assigned .",
    "this step is performed numerically , at sought accuracy , via a newton - raphson method .",
    "consider first the limiting case @xmath7 .",
    "depending on the value of the predicted magnetization @xmath46 , one can ideally identify two different regimes : the homogeneous case corresponds to @xmath47 ( non - magnetized ) , while the non - homogeneous setting is found for ( magnetized ) @xmath48 solutions .",
    "a phase transition @xcite materializes in the parameters plane @xmath49 and the resulting scenario is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
    "when fixing the initial magnetization and decreasing the energy density , the system passes from homogeneous to non - homogeneous qss . the parameters plane can be then formally partitioned into two zones respectively associated to an ordered non - homogeneous phase , @xmath48 , ( lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] ) , and a disordered homogeneous state , @xmath47 ( upper part ) .",
    "these regions are delimited by a transition line , collection of all the critical points ( @xmath50 ) , which can be in turn segmented into two distinct parts .",
    "plane at @xmath7 .",
    "the full line refers to the the first order transition , while the dashed line stands for the second order one .",
    "the symbol traces the exact location of the tricritical point .",
    "inset : lateral edges of the coexistence regions in the first order region , as predicted by the theory . ]    the full line stands for a first order phase transition : the magnetization experiences a finite jump when crossing the critical value ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "conversely , the dashed line refers to a second order phase transition : the magnetization is continuously modulated , from zero to positive values , when passing the curve from top to bottom . first and second lines merge in a tricritical point .",
    "the case with @xmath11 has been recently addressed in @xcite for what concerns the lynden - bell theory and working at constant @xmath18 , while the equilibrium properties have been thoroughly studied in @xcite .",
    "again , the lynden bell approach proves accurate in predicting the macroscopic behavior as seen in the @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "interestingly , below a threshold in energy the system shows negative susceptibility @xmath51 , the magnetization decreasing when the strength of @xmath0 is enhanced .",
    "conversely , above the critical energy value , the magnetization amount grows with @xmath0 , which corresponds to dealing with positive susceptibility . besides providing an a posteriori evidence on the adequacy of the lynden - bell technique",
    ", the presence of a region with negative susceptibility , was interpreted in @xcite as the signature of an out - of - equilibrium ensemble inequivalence .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the field @xmath0 removes the phase transition and the magnetization continuously decreases from unity , at zero temperature , to zero , at infinite temperature .",
    "therefore , a modest , though non negligible spatial polarization of the rotors is present also in the parameters region that was destined to homogeneous phases in the limiting case @xmath7 .    starting from this setting , we have decided to perform a campaign of vlasov based simulations to challenge the rich scenario predicted within the realm of the lynden - bell violent relaxation theory . by numerically solving the vlasov equation ,",
    "we avoid dealing with finite size effects , as stemming in direct @xmath1-body schemes , and so provide a more reliable assessment of the overall correctness of the theory .",
    "the results of the investigations are reported in the forthcoming sections .",
    "the vlasov equation ( [ eq : vlasov ] ) can be resolved numerically . to this end",
    ", we use the semi - lagrangian method with cubic spline interpolation , as implemented in the vmf90 program that has been used already in ref .",
    "@xcite with the hmf model .    in order to study the properties of the qss regime",
    ", we adopt the following procedure :    1 .",
    "the system is started with a waterbag initial condition ( [ f_0-hmf ] ) .",
    "it is run without collecting data between times @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "time averages of the magnetization @xmath46 , of @xmath39 and of the variance of the magnetization @xmath46 are performed in the time range between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , defining @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57    we thus skip the strong oscillations of the initial violent relaxation and focus on the subsequent dynamical regime , where , anyway , some oscillations are still present , which we quantify by the standard deviation @xmath58 .",
    "we repeat the above procedure on a grid of 39 by 39 points in the @xmath49 plane , each one corresponding to a simulation .",
    "performing such a study allows us to assess in a systematic manner the behaviour of the average magnetization in the qss regime and to compare numerical results with lynden - bell s theory . whether the theory is flexible enough to accommodate all the general features of the resulting diagram depends on it taking into account in a comprehensive manner the behaviour of the model .",
    "the average value of the magnetization taken from vlasov simulations is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nofield ] .",
    "the line of transition provided by lynden - bell s theory is displayed on top and we observe that it separates satisfactorily the region @xmath59 from the region @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "the transition is sharp for low values of @xmath62 , corresponding to the prediction of lynden - bell s theory that the transition is of first order .",
    "the transition is smoother for larger values of @xmath62 , corresponding to the lynden - bell s prediction of a second order transition .     for the hmf model with no external field .",

    "the general aspect of the diagram is similar , although , as remarked in @xcite , the transition looks overall sharper when using @xmath63 as an order parameter .",
    "we note that lynden - bell s transition line separates very well the non - homogeneous from the homogeneous phase for @xmath65 . for higher values of @xmath62",

    "this occurs when the phase of @xmath9 is @xmath67 ( instead of zero ) .",
    "the phase could in principle take any value in @xmath68 $ ] , but since @xmath23 the only dynamically accessible values are @xmath69 and @xmath67 .",
    "the fact that @xmath39 can flip from positive to negative values is also an indication of the presence of a second - order phase transition .",
