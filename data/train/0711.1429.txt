    "the flow in the gap between coaxial rotating cylinders , known as the taylor  couette flow ( tc flow hereinafter ) , is among the most investigated problems in fluid mechanics ( see @xcite for an overview ) , owing to its engineering applications @xcite , as well as to its relevance as prototypical flow in the study of transition to turbulence and of fully - developed turbulent flows over streamwise - curved surfaces .",
    "many experimental and numerical papers have dealt with the instabilities developed by the tc flow when the value of the reynolds number @xmath0 is increased such that the laminar regime is taken over by a sequence of bifurcations , eventually leading to chaotic behavior .",
    "less is known about the fully turbulent regime , since a smaller number of laboratory experiments and essentially no direct numerical simulation ( dns ) studies are available .",
    "the lack of dns investigations can be ascribed  at least in part  to the difficulties of implementing an efficient method for the numerical solution of the incompressible navier ",
    "stokes equations in cylindrical geometries , and at the same time to the computational demand of such simulations in turbulent regime .",
    "hence a satisfactory quantitative description of the turbulent tc flow , leveraging the full space - time information potentially available from a dns , is as yet missing .    in the first part of this paper",
    "a numerical method for the dns of the navier  stokes in cylindrical coordinates is presented , which is designed for computing the taylor ",
    "couette flow in the turbulent regime .",
    "the method relies on the strategy developed by quadrio & luchini @xcite for the dns of a turbulent flow in an annular pipe : the main enhancements introduced here are an improved accuracy of the spatial discretization , and the ability of the code to exploit parallel computing on commodity hardware .",
    "the newly developed numerical method is then used to carry out what we believe is the first dns of the turbulent taylor  couette flow .",
    "we shall focus on a so - called small - gap geometry , identical to that considered by andereck , liu & swinney @xcite , and set the reynolds number to a relatively high value .",
    "analysis of the results will focus on the assessment of low - order flow statistics , and on some theoretical issues concerning turbulence in presence of wall curvature . as described at length in the review paper @xcite by patel & sotiropoulos , curvature",
    "considerably impacts the modeling of turbulent flows .",
    "its effects thus carry a broad interest , and also affect experimental practices .",
    "for example , when measuring the skin friction in a turbulent flow over a curved wall , one often resorts to methods ( like the clauser plot ) which imply the validity of the law of the wall , and which often require the numerical values of its parameters ( i.e. the slope of the logarithmic part of the profile , given by the inverse of the von krmn constant , and its intercept ) to be known in advance . indeed , neither these values possess to date an agreed - upon value , nor is their dependence on the degree of curvature known .",
    "a further example occurs in the derivation of the friction law for the tc flow , i.e. a formula relating the friction coefficient to the value of the reynolds number : such derivation , actively discussed in literature @xcite , is often based on assumptions ( logarithmic form vs. power law ) about the shape of the mean velocity profile .",
    "a dns , with its ability to evaluate the skin friction directly , is a powerful tool to complement experimental data in this research areas .",
    "of course the main limitation of dns lies in the limited values of the reynolds number typically affordable in the numerical simulations .",
    "this is the reason why in this paper the numerical method is developed with great emphasis on computational efficiency .",
    "a dns at a relatively high value of @xmath0 will also offer the opportunity to observe to what extent a planar , pressure - driven and fully - developed turbulent flow ( like a channel flow ) presents analogies to the tc flow , in the spirit of what has been already observed by lee & kim @xcite for the planar tc flow .",
    "the present simulation reaches an unprecedently high value of @xmath0 , so that the comparison is made at the value @xmath1 ( based on the friction velocity and half the gap width ) , which is considered the minimum bound for the near - wall viscous turbulent cycle to be fully active .",
    "a significant physical process which acts in the tc flow and is absent in plane geometries is the additional mass and momentum transfer exerted by large - scale toroidal rolls .",
    "the laminar solution is known to be unstable above a well - defined ( and curvature - dependent ) critical value @xmath2 of the reynolds number , above which such structures , known as taylor vortices , are quickly generated @xcite . as @xmath0 increases further ,",
    "the taylor vortices undergo a series of transformations , after which they eventually reappear in the turbulent regime @xcite . in his illuminated paper @xcite ,",
    "townsend surmised that turbulence in the tc flow is basically of two different kinds , with one contribution from the wall shear and the other from the large - scale structures .",
    "dns is the perfect tool to analyze the full flow field and to describe these large - scale structures , that are absent both in the plane channel and in the plane couette flows .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] the geometry of the problem is introduced , and the main elements of its numerical simulation are recalled in  [ sec : equations ] ( additional information is deferred to an appendix ) . a validation of the computer code and a critical comparison of its results to available data will be given in ",

    "the reynolds number @xmath0 is defined with the inner cylinder rotating speed @xmath13 , the gap width @xmath14 between the two cylinders and the kinematic viscosity @xmath15 of the fluid . for a given value of @xmath16 , when gravity and other external forces are neglected",
    ", @xmath0 becomes the sole relevant fluid dynamic parameter .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the results presented in the following are made non - dimensional by using @xmath17 as reference velocity and @xmath18 as reference length . when useful , the wall distance @xmath19 is also used , conveniently defined as @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "quantities made non - dimensional in wall units are indicated with a @xmath22 superscript and are computed with friction velocity @xmath23 ( see  [ sec : results ] for details concerning its definition ) and fluid viscosity @xmath15 .",
    "the taylor  couette system is of course most easily described in cylindrical coordinates . on the other hand , a widely used and extremely efficient formulation of the navier ",
    "stokes equations exists in cartesian coordinates , and is well suited to the dns of turbulent flows with two homogeneous directions .",
    "this formulation was introduced by kim , moin & moser @xcite , and is based on rewriting the equations of motion in terms of two scalar equations for the wall - normal components of the velocity and vorticity vector .",
    "the computational efficiency is maximized when flow variables are expanded in fourier series in the two homogeneous directions ( the wall - normal discretization is irrelevant ) .",
    "a few studies have described the extension of this formulation to a cylindrical geometry , to enjoy the same advantages : pressure removed from the equations , and optimal computational load .",
    "we build for the present work upon the contribution by quadrio & luchini @xcite , who wrote evolutive equations for the radial components of velocity and vorticity in cylindrical coordinates , and used finite differences to compute radial derivatives with schemes of second - order formal accuracy .",
    "the time integration was carried out in @xcite with an explicit third - order runge ",
    "kutta method for the nonlinear terms and curvature - related viscous terms , and a second - order crank  nicholson scheme for the remaining viscous terms .",
    "the present work employes a numerical method which is improved in at least two respects compared to ref .",
    "@xcite : the second - order accuracy of the finite - difference schemes was not considered satisfactory , and  most importantly  distributed - memory parallel computing capabilities are required . as shown by luchini and quadrio in their recent paper @xcite ,",
    "these two issues can be dealt with in an unified approach .",
    "the formal accuracy of the radial derivatives  and , most importantly , their spectral resolution  is improved by resorting to high - accuracy compact difference schemes .",
    "the schemes are moreover made explicit , by following the procedure illustrated by thomas @xcite which leverages the absence of the third derivative in the equations of motions , to reduce their computational cost . at the same time , finite differences , which enjoy the property of being local operators in physical space , are key to obtain a good parallel performance on commodity networking hardware .    reproducing the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite in the cylindrical case , however , is not trivial .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the governing equations require further manipulation in order to arrive at a form where explicit compact schemes can be applied .",
    "a computational stencil made by 5 arbitrarily spaced ( and smoothly stretched ) grid points is used to obtain a formal accuracy of order at least 4 , and the coefficients are computed , according to an approach common in the theory of pad approximants , by matching the discrete derivative of a function known in analytic form ( e.g. a polynomial ) to its analytical derivative .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a general illustration of the method in the cartesian case , and to the appendix for a short discussion of the peculiarities of the cylindrical case .",
    "full description of the method is given by ref .",
    "the present computer code is carefully validated against both numerical and experimental data available for the tc flow through preliminary calculations at non - turbulent values of @xmath0 .    the correctness and accuracy of finite - difference radial operators is preliminarily checked by computing the exact laminar solution . in the laminar regime , the flow is described by an exact solution of the navier ",

    "[ fig : validation ] together with the analytical solution .",
    "the difference between computed and analytical curves is indeed observed to decrease as requested by the formal fourth - order accuracy of the numerical method .",
    "the entire code is then tested both in large- and small - gap geometries for the first insurgence of taylor vortices , to verify that the evolution of small - amplitude disturbances is well represented .",

    "the discretization parameters are reported in table [ tab : parameters - validation ] ( `` straight - vortex '' case ) .",
    "the temporal evolution of the kinetic energy is monitored , to verify whether the initial energy decreases or gets amplified depending on @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath26 we find @xmath2 to be confined within the range @xmath31 . at the same curvature , previous numerical simulations by fasel & booz @xcite , based on an axisymmetrical finite - difference method , determined @xmath32 , whereas experimental measurements @xcite indicated @xmath33 .",
    "for the small - gap case , at @xmath34 we compute @xmath35 , which agrees with the value of @xmath36 determined by moser et al .",

    "the torque needed to maintain the rotation of the inner cylinder is computed as an indicator of global spatial accuracy , and compared with previous works .",
    "the torque is defined as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the axial length of the cylinders .",
    "table [ tab : torque ] show how values of @xmath39 computed by the present code at @xmath26 compare very well ( within small fractions of a percent ) to literature data .",
    "a further increase in @xmath0 brings us into the non - linear regime , where the straight taylor vortices undergo a wavy azimuthal deformation and are named `` wavy vortices '' after the paper @xcite by coles .",
    "the prediction of quantitative properties of the wavy taylor vortices , like their azimuthal wavenumber and their phase speed , allows a further confirmation of the present code .",
    "a simulation with the discretization parameters reported in table [ tab : parameters - validation ] ( `` wavy - vortex '' case ) has been carried out at @xmath26 and @xmath40 . in this simulation only , to ease the comparison with the paper @xcite by snider , the outer cylinder possesses a small amount of counter - rotation , such that @xmath0 based on the outer cylinder s rotation speed is @xmath41 .",
    "the simulation , described in detail in @xcite , shows a pair of wavy vortices , with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath42 , and a characteristic rotation period @xmath43 .",

    "parallel simulations are carried out on a dedicated computing system , called a personal supercomputer , which is based on commodity personal computers .",
    "the special architecture of this system , that can be used with either the cartesian or the cylindrical code , has been described in ref .",
    "the system is made by 10 smp nodes , each equipped with 2 intel xeon 2.66 ghz cpu , and at least 1 gb of 266 mhz sdram .",
    "the nodes carry two gigabit ethernet adapters each , and are connected in a ring topology .    on one xeon cpu",
    "the code requires 680 mb of memory , and takes 182 seconds to compute a full time step for a 3-substeps runge - kutta temporal scheme .",
    "the amount of memory includes storage space for the radial coefficients discussed in the appendix .",
    "should ram size become an issue , these coefficients can can be computed on - the - fly , thus saving 13% of ram at the expense of a comparable increase in computing time .",
    "the cpu overhead of the cylindrical code compared to its cartesian counterpart is about 40% overall .",
    "table [ tab : speedup ] documents how the computation is speed up by employing an increasing number @xmath48 of computing nodes .",
    "the ratio between the wall - clock time on one cpu and the wall clock time with @xmath48 distributed - memory cpus , i.e. the parallel speedup @xmath49 , is not far from the linear one : the pls parallel strategy in the present context thus exploits fully our low - cost computing system .",
    "the maximum measured speedup with @xmath50 is about 9 .",
    "the smp capabilities of the nodes are then exploited on top of the distributed - memory parallel strategy .",
    "this allows a further 1.6 speedup factor from the use of 2 cpus .",
    "the smp speedup is additive to the distributed - memory speedup , and shows essentially no decrease with increasing the number of computing nodes .",
    "the entire wall clock time for the simulation described in ",
    "[ sec : turbulent - dns ] can thus be decreased from about 6 months to about 11 days when the entire system is used .",
    "the geometry considered in the present analysis is the small - gap geometry described by andereck , liu & swinney @xcite with @xmath51 , which gives @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the value of the reynolds number is set at @xmath54 , to obtain a value of the friction reynolds number similar to @xmath55 , which is typically considered the lowest value at which a turbulent channel flow presents a well - developed inner layer @xcite . to our knowledge , this is the highest value of @xmath0 ever reached in a dns of couette flow , and of course represents a big computational challenge : for comparison , bech et al .",
    "@xcite computed a fully turbulent plane couette flow , which is the limit for @xmath56 of the present tc flow , at @xmath57 only . according to hamilton , kim & waleffe @xcite , the plane couette flow is turbulent above @xmath58 .",
    "the size of the computational domain must be chosen by keeping in mind that periodic boundary conditions are used in the two homogeneous directions : a periodic box imposes an artificial large - wavelength cutoff to the structures that can be represented in the numerical simulation .",
    "it can be recalled however that periodicity in the streamwise direction is a physically sound condition for the tc flow , unlike planar channel and couette flows .",

    "the turbulent tc flow presents a dominant periodic pattern in the axial direction too : toroidal structures present an axial wavelength of @xmath60 , and experimental results @xcite indicate that this wavelength is rather insensitive to the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the simulations are thus carried out for @xmath61 .",
    "it can be mentioned moreover that the implied indefinite mirroring of periodic boxes makes the present simulation totally free from the end - effects that are unavoidable in laboratory experiments .    to obtain the resolution of all the significant spatial scales , @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "fourier modes are used in the azimuthal and axial directions respectively , and for the radial direction @xmath47 .",
    "the spatial resolution in wall units matches or exceeds the typical resolution employed in channel - flow dns @xcite .",
    "the global number of degrees of freedom amounts to @xmath62 .",
    "the parameters related to the spatial discretization are reported in table [ tab : parameters - turbulent ] .",
    "the resolution of the relevant temporal scales dictates the time step size .",
    "we use @xmath63 , which is smaller than the stability limit of the employed runge  kutta scheme . in viscous units",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath64 .",
    "a null mean pressure gradient is imposed in both the homogeneous directions .",
    "the adequacy of the present size for the computational domain can be first evaluated in terms of inner ( viscous ) units , i.e. by making lengths non - dimensional with the friction velocity @xmath23 ( see later  [ sec : results ] for its definition ) and the fluid viscosity . with the friction velocity computed at the inner wall @xmath65 , whereas at the outer wall @xmath66 .",
    "the streamwise length is between @xmath67 at the inner wall and @xmath68 at the outer wall . a comparison with the domain sizes usually employed for dns in the turbulent plane channel flow show that the domain size is certainly adequate for representing the inner turbulent layer .",
    "the streamwise length @xmath69 is 2.5 times the streamwise length typically employed @xcite in the dns of a plane turbulent channel flow at a comparable value of friction reynolds number ; the spanwise width is large enough to represent well the underlying turbulent flow , being larger than that used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it remains to be determined whether representing a single pair of periodic structures is actually enough to obtain domain - independent low - order statistics .",
    "given the emphasis of the present work towards high possible @xmath0 , we decided to use the available computational resources to reach the highest @xmath0 while representing a single pair of tv , and to check a posteriori that low - order statistics are not significantly affected by the axial domain size .",
    "the check consisted in running an additional simulation for a domain size with doubled @xmath70 , and an accordingly doubled @xmath71 .",
    "at the same time , the averaging time is halved to maintain the computational load approximately constant . in short",
    ", the result of this check , that will be further discussed in the following , is that representing a single pair of structures is adequate for measuring low - order statistics .",
    "the initial condition for the simulations is based on the laminar solution ( [ eq : laminar - solution ] ) ; divergence - free velocity disturbances with amplitude @xmath72 and random phase are added to the whole set of fourier modes .",
    "different initial conditions have been considered in ( less resolved ) preliminary simulations , by either changing the amplitude of the disturbances , or by applying disturbances to a partial set of modes , or by starting the run from a null mean velocity profile instead of the profile given by eq .",

    ", no difference has been noticed among these cases after the turbulent regime sets up , even though the time required to reach the statistically steady - state , as well as the behaviour of the flow during the initial transient , have been observed to depend on the details of the initial conditions .     at the inner wall ( continuous line ) and outer wall ( dashed line ) as a function of time after the startup of the simulation . ]",

    "the size of a single flow field is 185 mbytes .",
    "the time required for the simulation to settle to a statistically steady - state requires an initial time interval : we have estimated it based on the time history of various quantities , including the derivative of the space - mean velocity longitudinal velocity profile friction computed at the walls , which is related to @xmath74 .",

    "the radial profile @xmath83 of the mean azimuthal component of the velocity vector is shown in figure [ fig : uav ] and compared to the laminar solution ( [ eq : laminar - solution ] ) . while the laminar profile at this curvature level is little different from a straight line , the turbulent profile presents , in analogy to the plane turbulent couette flow , two distinct regions : near the walls a shear - driven boundary layer , and in the central part of the gap a region where the velocity decreases very slowly with @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , the large central region presents an almost constant or very slowly - increasing angular momentum @xmath81 ; its value of nearly @xmath85 agrees with the measurements by taylor @xcite and smith & townsend @xcite .",
    "this property of the flow , observed here for the first time in a numerical simulation , qualitatively supports the hypothesis of a core region of constant angular momentum flow put forward by townsend @xcite .",

    "the profiles over both walls are fairly similar up to @xmath91 ( buffer layer ) , but in the central part of the gap the outer profile becomes slightly higher than the inner one : this indicates that the friction velocity ( local to each wall ) alone is not the correct scaling velocity in this region of the flow .",

    "a visualization of a snapshots of the flow field has shown how the large - scale structures are embedded in the flow and retain their basic shape , though blurred by the surrounding small - scale turbulence .",
