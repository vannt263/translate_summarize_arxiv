    "the energy region around 10@xmath0  ev ( eev ) is thought to be a transition from cosmic rays of galactic origin to those of extragalactic origin .",
    "many cosmic - ray experiments have searched for point - like sources as the origin of cosmic rays on the isotropic cosmic - ray sky in this energy region . among them , the fly s eye experiment and the akeno 20-km@xmath5 array independently reported a point - like excess around cygnus  x-3 above 0.5  eev with a statistical significance at the 3  @xmath6 level @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the haverah park array found no significant excess around cygnus  x-3 during a period that overlaps most of the fly s eye observation @xcite .",
    "after these observations , however , there has been no systematic search of the northern sky in this energy region to date .",
    "the hires collaboration did search for point - like deviations from isotropy in the northern sky for @xmath7  ev , however this is an order of magnitude higher than the energy threshold of the previous cygnus  x-3 observations @xcite .",
    "recently , the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) surveyed for point - like sources around 1  eev with large statistics in the southern sky .",
    "they concluded that there was no significant excess , although the stacked cosmic - ray events from the directions of 10 _ fermi _ bright sources showed a potential excess of 2.35  @xmath6 above 1  eev @xcite .",
    "the energy flux limits set by the pao are well below those observed from some galactic tev gamma - ray sources .",
    "therefore , they infer that this indicates that tev gamma - ray emission from those sources might be of electromagnetic origin , or their proton spectra do not extend up to eev energies @xcite .",
    "there are a few possibilities regarding the particle types and distances of the point - like sources at eev energies .",
    "the mean free path length of gamma rays with an energy of eev is estimated to be approximately @xmath8  kpc , which strongly limits them to the neighborhood of our galaxy .",
    "the mean decay length of neutrons with an energy of eev is calculated to be @xmath9  kpc , which corresponds to the galactic center distance at 1  eev .",
    "neutrons with @xmath10  eev enable us to look out over all of our galaxy .",
    "the larmor radius of protons with an energy of eev is estimated to be approximately @xmath11  kpc at 3  @xmath12 g within our galaxy .",
    "this curvature , however , makes it impossible to find point - like sources .",
    "consequently , neutrons and gamma rays from galactic sources are the most promising in the search for point - like sources .    the telescope array ( ta ) experiment has been observing ultra - high - energy cosmic rays with @xmath13  ev since 2008 .",
    "we are probing the origins of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays using the observational results from the ta , such as the cosmic - ray energy spectrum , mass composition , and directional anisotropy .",
    "our current results are summarized as follows . the detailed energy spectrum above 10@xmath14  ev was measured @xcite , and it shows a steepening at @xmath15  ev , which is consistent with theoretical expectation from the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff @xcite .",
    "the preliminary result for the cosmic - ray composition above 10@xmath14  ev was consistent with the proton prediction within the statistical and systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "we also put stringent upper limits on the absolute flux of ultra - high - energy photons at energies @xmath16  ev @xcite .",
    "these limits strongly constrain top - down models on the origin of cosmic rays .",
    "ta has searched for uhecr anisotropies such as autocorrelations , correlations with agns , and correlations with the lsss of the universe using the first 40 months of sd data @xcite . using the 5-year sd data , we updated results of the cosmic - ray anisotropy for @xmath17  eev , which show deviations from isotropy at the significance of 23  @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "finally , we observe on indication for large - scale anisotropy of cosmic rays with @xmath17  eev in the northern hemisphere sky using the 5-year data set with additional statistics collected with the sd @xcite .",
    "the probability of this anisotropy appearing by chance in an isotropic cosmic - ray sky is calculated to be 3.7@xmath1810@xmath19 ( 3.4  @xmath6 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the search for point - like sources of neutral particles , such as neutrons or photons , at relatively low energies , @xmath20  ev with the high cosmic - ray statistics from the surface detector of the ta experiment , which has the largest effective area in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the ta is the largest cosmic - ray detector in the northern hemisphere and consists of a surface detector ( sd ) array @xcite and three fluorescence detector ( fd ) stations @xcite .",
    "the ta has been in full operation in millard country , utah , usa ( @xmath21n , @xmath22w ; about 1,400  m above sea level ) since 2008 .",
    "the ta sd array consists of 507 plastic scintillator counters , each 3  m@xmath23 in area , placed at grid points 1.2  km apart ; it covers an area of approximately 700  km@xmath5 .",
    "the ta sd array observes cosmic rays with @xmath24  eev , regardless of the weather conditions , using the extensive air shower ( eas ) technique with a duty cycle of 24 hours and a wide field of view ( fov ) .",
    "these capabilities ensure a very stable and large geometrical exposure for the northern sky survey , in comparison with the fd observations , for which the duty cycle is limited to @xmath2510% .",
    "the air shower reconstruction and data selection were optimized for the low - energy air showers around @xmath26  ev on the basis of the reconstruction method developed in anisotropy and energy spectrum studies @xcite . to measure an accurate energy spectrum with the eas technique",
    ", the absolute acceptance of the eas array as a function of the energy must be carefully determined .",
    "therefore , air shower reconstruction usually requires the elimination of reconstructed of events which lack excellent energy resolution .",
    "however , the absolute acceptance is not always required in this analysis because we deduce the cosmic - ray backgrounds from the data themselves by the equi - zenith angle method , as described in the following sections .",
    "hence , we substantially loosen the event cuts in the air shower reconstruction , at the cost of good energy resolution .",
    "the number of events remaining in the reconstruction used in the energy spectrum study @xcite is relatively small ( @xmath2514,800 events above 10@xmath14  ev ) owing to many hard parameter cuts , which is called the `` standard cut '' in this paper , mainly to improve the energy resolution for spectrum study . to search for small- and large - scale anisotropy ,",
    "air shower statistics is more important than energy resolution if the anisotropy changes gradually with the energy . table  [ tbl-1 ] shows the number of remaining events according to four simple criteria that are defined as the loose cuts : ( 1 ) each event must include at least four scintillator counters ; ( 2 ) the zenith angle of the event arrival direction must be less than 55@xmath27 ; ( 3 ) the angular uncertainty estimated by the timing fit must be less than 10@xmath27 ; ( 4 ) the reconstructed energy must be greater than 0.5  eev .",
    "the number of triggered events is @xmath28 .",
    "the trigger condition is the three - fold coincidence of adjacent sd elements with greater than three vertical equivalent muons within 8  @xmath12s @xcite .",
    "the number of air showers after the loose cuts is @xmath2510 times larger around 1  eev compared with that in the `` standard - cut '' data .",
    "this is a remarkable advantage in the search for anisotropy in the eev energy region , even though the angular resolution and energy resolution are moderately degraded .",
    "the angular resolution with the loose - cut data is estimated to be @xmath29 for @xmath3  eev , whereas that of the standard - cut data is estimated to be @xmath30 .",
    "the energy resolution with the loose - cut data is estimated to be @xmath31% , whereas that of the standard - cut data is estimated to be @xmath32% .",
    "the optimization of the air shower reconstruction for low - energy air showers was studied by a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation based on corsika version 6.960 @xcite , with hadronic interaction models qgsjet - ii-03 , fluka2008.3c , and egs4 @xcite for air shower event generation and the geant4 for the response of each scintillator counter @xcite .",
    "primary cosmic rays are generated on the basis of the energy spectrum measured by the hires experiment at energies of 10@xmath33  ev to 10@xmath34  ev @xcite .",
    "because of the uncertainty in the composition of primary cosmic rays in this energy region , we use pure proton and pure iron in this mc simulation .",
    "further , the core locations of simulated air shower events are uniformly distributed over a circle 25  km in radius and centered at the central laser facility @xcite , which is located in the center of the ta at a distance of 20.85  km from each of the fd stations .",
    "these simulated events were analyzed in the same way as the experimental data to deduce the energy and arrival direction of cosmic rays , including the detailed detector responses and calibrations such as the dead time of detectors and time variations in the detector gains .    in this analysis ,",
    "we re - optimized the geometric reconstruction of the arrival direction using the modified linsley time - delay function @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the time delay of air shower particles from the shower plane ( ns ) , @xmath37 is the perpendicular distance from the shower axis ( m ) , @xmath38 is the pulse height per unit area ( vem / m@xmath5 , where vem is the vertical equivalent muon , which is the average pulse height produced by vertically penetrating muons in the detector ) , and @xmath39 is the linsley curvature parameter @xcite .",
    "the curvature parameter `` @xmath39 '' was a free parameter in the previous analysis @xcite . however , the number of misreconstructions increase for the low - energy air showers which were detected by the small number of detectors .",
    "therefore , the @xmath39 set to be fixed parameter to reduce the misreconstructions , and optimized as @xmath40 by the mc simulation dependence on the zenith angle @xmath41 .",
    "the energy was estimated from a lateral distribution fit with the same form as that used in the standard - cut analysis @xcite .",
    "first , we calculate @xmath42 , the density of air shower particles at a lateral distance of 800  m from the core , by the lateral distribution fit .",
    "then , @xmath42 was converted to the energy using a look - up table for @xmath42 and the zenith angle determined from the mc simulation using the loose - cut events .",
    "the energies reconstructed by the sd were renormalized by 1/1.27 to match the sd energy scale to that of the fd , which was determined calorimetrically @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the reconstructed energy distribution and compares data to mc .",
    "the mc simulation is consistent with the data distribution . in this figure",
    ", one can see that the reconstruction efficiency with the loose cuts around 1  eev is increased by 10 times compared with that with the standard cuts .",
    "this is a remarkable advantage in the search for anisotropy in the eev energy region .",
    "for the point - like source search , we divided the loose - cut data set into four energy regions : @xmath43 ( 58,895 events ) , @xmath44 ( 67,277 events ) , @xmath45 ( 54,472 events ) , and @xmath46 ( 121,749 events ) .",
    "the first energy threshold , 0.5  eev , corresponds to the energy of the cygnus x-3 fluxes measured by the akeno array and the fly s eye .",
    "the data set with the highest energy threshold extends the range to visible neutron sources anywhere in our galaxy .",
    "the performance of the sd was thoroughly verified by a fd - sd hybrid data analysis @xcite independent of the mc simulation .",
    "the arrival directions of the hybrid events were determined by the fluorescence track measured by the fd and the air shower arrival position at the ground measured by the sd .",
    "this hybrid reconstruction is almost independent of the sd reconstruction , and its angular resolution , @xmath47 , is better than that of the sd reconstruction , @xmath48 around 1  eev .",
    "therefore , the hybrid data are a good reference for estimating the systematic errors in the arrival direction",
    ". figure  [ fig2](a ) shows the opening angle distributions of the zenith angles measured using the hybrid method ( @xmath49 ) and the sd ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2](b ) shows the opening angle distributions of the azimuthal angles measured using the hybrid method ( @xmath51 ) and the sd ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the solid curves are fitted to the data points by a double - gaussian function , @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 indicates the @xmath55-th gaussian function , @xmath56 is the @xmath55-th height , @xmath57 is the common mean value in the two gaussians , @xmath58 is the @xmath55-th standard deviation , and @xmath59 is the opening angle .",
    "the mean opening angles of the zenith angle is calculated to be @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) using the chi - squared minimization technique , while that of the azimuthal angle is calculated to be @xmath63 ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) . from these results , the systematic pointing error of the reconstructed sd shower",
    "is estimated to be approximately @xmath66 .",
    "this is obviously negligible compared with our angular resolution .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] ( c ) shows the distribution of the space angle between the directions measured by sd and the hybrid method above 0.5  eev .",
    "a space angle containing 68% of the events @xmath67 is estimated to be @xmath68 .",
    "we studied the angular resolution of the cosmic - ray arrival directions containing 68% of the reconstructed events , dependence on the zenith angle . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , the solid and dashed histograms show the angular resolutions of the mc simulations for proton and iron , respectively .",
    "the closed circles show the estimated angular resolution @xmath69 from the following quadratic sum relation .",
    "@xmath70 where , @xmath67 is a space angle , containing 68% of the events , between the directions measured by the sd and the hybrid method , which corresponds to figure  [ fig2 ] ( c ) , @xmath47 is assumed to be the angular resolution of the hybrid method independent of the zenith angle and energy @xcite .",
    "the @xmath71 values estimated from the sd - fd hybrid data are in reasonable agreement with the mc simulation results .",
    "they agree to better than 3  @xmath6 for all energy bins . above 2  eev ,",
    "the angular resolution estimated from the hybrid data is slightly better than that from the proton mc , whereas it is consistent with that from the iron mc .",
    "because the composition of primary cosmic rays in this energy region is still under debate owing to the systematic uncertainty , the average difference in angular resolution between the data and the proton mc is defined as a systematic error of the angular resolution , which corresponds to @xmath2515% , assuming the worst case .",
    "thus , these estimations from the hybrid data are good checks for the reconstruction of the ta sd independent of the mc simulation . in figure  [ fig3 ] ,",
    "the angular resolution is clearly improved at larger zenith angles , and the iron - induced air shower shows slightly better resolution than the proton - induced air shower .",
    "this is because the footprint of the air shower at large zenith angles is larger than that at small zenith angles , and the muon component is much greater at large zenith angles than at small zenith angles .",
    "the time distribution of muons in an air shower is narrower than that of the electromagnetic components .",
    "therefore , air showers with a high ratio of muons to secondary particles , such as large - zenith - angle or iron - induced air showers , might enable us to better determine the geometry of the air shower front .    finally , we estimate the energy resolution of the ta sd with the loose - cut data set using the hybrid data .",
    "figure  [ fig4](a ) shows a scatter plot of the reconstructed energy from the sd and the hybrid method .",
    "figure  [ fig4](b ) shows the distribution of the natural logarithm of the ratio of the reconstructed energy from the sd and the hybrid method .",
    "the energy resolution of the hybrid analysis is 7% , which is sufficiently better than that of the sd @xcite . from figure  [ fig4 ] , the energy resolution of the sd with the loose - cut data",
    "is estimated to be @xmath25@xmath31% for @xmath3  eev , whereas that with the standard - cut data is estimated to be @xmath25@xmath72% .",
    "this resolution is good enough to find a point - like source if its flux changes gradually with the energy .",
    "various background estimation methods have been developed to analyze the cosmic - ray anisotropy .",
    "a simple method is to compare the distribution of air shower directions generated by the mc simulation directly with the data . in this analysis ,",
    "the typical number of background events for a target source is up to @xmath25200 . to determine the significance of the excess within an accuracy of 0.1  @xmath6",
    ", the background should be estimated as 0.7% ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "however , the mc simulation usually does not reproduce the data with this accuracy due to the simulation model dependence and meteorological effects , which are difficult to incorporate into the mc simulation . in the alternative method",
    ", the background can be estimated by the data themselves without the mc simulation . to extract an excess of air shower events coming from the direction of a target source",
    ", we adopt the equi - zenith angle method developed by the tibet as@xmath74 experiment @xcite to find gamma - ray excesses from huge cosmic - ray background events in the tev energy region .",
    "the signals are searched for by counting the number of events coming from a target source in an on - source cell with a finite size .",
    "the background is estimated by the number of events averaged over six off - source cells with the same angular radius as the on - source cell at the same zenith angle , recorded at the same time as the on - source cell events .",
    "note that the equi - zenith angle method fails when the source object stays at a zenith angle of less than 10@xmath27 , because the off - source cells overlap with other cells .",
    "therefore , the air shower events with zenith angles larger than 10@xmath27 were used in this analysis .",
    "the search window size of the on- and off - source cells should be optimized by the mc simulation to maximize the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio where the signal is the number of detected excess events , and the noise is the square root of the number of background events ( @xmath75 ) , which depends on the angular resolution . in this mc study , we generated air showers induced by protons , which have the same air shower development as those induced by neutrons .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows s / n ratio as a function of the search window radius @xmath76 in the mc simulation .",
    "the vertical axis is the s / n ratio , defined as the number of signals divided by @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , assuming that the the number of background events ( @xmath78 ) is proportional to the area of the search window @xmath79 .",
    "a peak ( arrow position ) indicates the optimal search window radius to maximize the s / n ratio .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the optimal search window radius @xmath76 at the maximum s / n ratio as a function of the zenith angle @xmath41 and the results of fitting by an empirical formula , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the fitting parameter denoting the window radius for a vertical air shower .",
    "the calculated @xmath81 values are @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for three energy regions : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , respectively . in this analysis ,",
    "we use these fitting curves in figure  [ fig6 ] as the optimal search window radius .",
    "if the signals show a normal gaussian distribution , the optimal window size @xmath88 should be close to the angular resolution @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath88 is , however , @xmath89 times smaller than @xmath71 because the signal spread shows a large - tail distribution .",
    "the off - source cells are located in the azimuthal direction at the same zenith angle as the on - source direction .",
    "four off - source cells are symmetrically aligned on each side of the on - source cell , at @xmath90 steps from the on - source position measured in terms of the real angle , and pick up events recorded at the same time to the on - source cell .",
    "this method , the so - called equi - zenith angle method , can reliably estimate the background events under the same conditions as those for the on - source events . here , it is worth noting that the two off - source cells adjacent to the on - source cell are excluded to avoid possible signal tail leakage into the off - source events .",
    "therefore , the total number of off - source cells is six .",
    "the ta sd has the anisotropy of 6% at the maximum in the azimuthal direction owing to the azimuthal dependence of the trigger efficiency .",
    "this anisotropy , which is well understood , appears along the grid of detector arrangement for the air showers with small number of hit detectors . to correct this anisotropy",
    ", we analyzed 19 dummy sources , which follow the same diurnal rotation ( at the same declination and a spacing of 18@xmath27 in right ascension , except for the location of the object itself ) in the same way as for the target source using the equi - zenith angle method .",
    "the background distribution of the mean values of the observed air shower events for the 19 dummy sources reproduces the background shape of the object at the same declination very well @xcite .",
    "the number of events in the @xmath55-th off - source cell of the target source @xmath91 is corrected by the number of events at the on- and off - source cells averaged over the 19 dummy sources using the following equation : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the corrected number of events at the @xmath55-th off - source cell , @xmath94 is the number of events averaged over the 19 dummy sources at the @xmath55-th off - source cell , and @xmath95 is the number of events averaged over the 19 dummy sources at the on - source cell .",
    "this correction enables us to remove the anisotropy of off - source events completely if the azimuthal anisotropy is stable .",
    "this is because the 19 dummy sources are observed on a different part of the sky every day , as they all orbit with the same diurnal rotation .",
    "the correction factors @xmath96 are @xmath97 which depends on the declination .",
    "finally , we calculate the statistical significance of cosmic - ray signals from the target sources against cosmic - ray background events using the following formula @xcite : @xmath98^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 are the number of events in the on - source cell , the number of corrected background events summed over six off - source cells ( @xmath102 ) , and the ratio of the on - source solid angle area to the off - source solid angle area ( @xmath101 = 1/6 in this work ) , respectively .",
    "we analyze 180,644 air showers collected by the ta sd from 2008 may 11 to 2013 may 4 .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the northern significance sky map drawn by the equi - zenith angle method using cosmic rays observed by the ta sd in the four energy regions . in this analysis , to ensure that we did not miss any possible unknown sources , the surveyed sky was oversampled .",
    "the centers of the tested target sources are set on @xmath103 grids , from 0@xmath27 to 360@xmath27 in right ascension and from 0@xmath27 to 70@xmath27 in declination . at each grid point , a search window with the optimal radius @xmath88 , as shown in figure  [ fig6 ] , was opened .",
    "the observed declination band is limited by the statistics and the analysis method .",
    "the number of events at dec.@xmath104 is small . at dec .",
    "@xmath105 , near the northern pole , the dummy source cells overlap other cells , so the statistical independence of each cell fails .",
    "the closed circles in figure  [ fig8 ] show the significance distributions from all directions in the four energy regions .",
    "the shaded area is the 95% containment region of 10@xmath106 mc samples in the isotropic sky .",
    "the good agreement between the data points and shaded area indicates that there is overall no significant excess beyond the statistical fluctuation in the northern sky .",
    "subsequently , we also searched for coincidence with the _ fermi _ bright galactic sources .",
    "the target sources in the _ fermi _ bright source list @xcite were chosen as confirmed or potential galactic sources in the same way as for the tev observations of the milagro and tibet as@xmath74 @xcite . out of the 205 most significant sources in the _ fermi _ bright source list , 84 are not identified as extragalactic sources . among these 84 , we selected 29 sources in the declination band between 0@xmath27 and 70@xmath27 , corresponding to the sensitive fov of the ta sd .",
    "the results of the search for neutral particles from the 29 _ fermi _ bright galactic sources are summarized in table  [ tbl-2 ] , where 15 of the selected sources are classified as pulsars ( psr ) , 5 are supernova remnants ( snr ) , 1 is a high - mass x - ray binary ( hxb ) , and 8 remain unidentified but are potential galactic sources ; they are mostly concentrated in the galactic plane ( @xmath107 ) @xcite .",
    "bright galactic sources are confirmed sources at tev energies , as shown in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the significance distributions of the 29 _ fermi _ source directions searched by the ta sd .",
    "the distributions are obviously consistent with the normal gaussian distribution , indicating that there are no statistically significant signals from these sources .",
    "we calculated the flux upper limits on the neutron intensity ( @xmath108 ) of the northern sky using the following equation : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the integral cosmic - ray flux ; @xmath111 is the upper limit on the observed excess @xmath112 according to a statistical prescription assuming an unphysical region , such as a region of negative excess @xcite ; @xmath113 ) is the average number of background events ; @xmath114 is the averaged solid angle of the search window for a target source depending on the declination ; and @xmath115 is the signal efficiency with the angular cut by @xmath114 deduced from the mc simulation of proton ( @xmath25 neutron ) assuming a point source .",
