    "the maximum and minimum are taken with respect of some variation of the conditions of the fields entering the beam splitter ( like the relative time shift , polarizations , etc . ) .",
    "as we are not able to measure instantenious values of the intensities in reality we have integrations over detectors time resolution @xmath43 we have taken the integration ( effectively ) over full time range , because we are interested in pulsed radiation , and we assume that the pulses time width is much narrower than the time resolution of the detectors .",
    "the redefined correlation function in the classical case , for the same physical conditions reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 and it does not depend on the manipulations on the beams before they enter the beam splitter ( under the mentioned relations between the pulses and time resolution of detection ) .",
    "thus if we write the initial field amplitudes as @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively for inputs @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the beam splitter , then we see that @xmath50 is just @xmath18 for fields of changed amplitudes , namely @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . as @xmath53 is a maximum visibility for @xmath18 for any inputs , the maximum visibility for @xmath50 can not breach this value .",
    "in the previous section we considered hom interference in terms of classical electric fields .",
    "the results showed , that new definition of correlation function ( @xmath18 and @xmath50 ) does not change final visibility of whole process and the maximal value of visibility is @xmath54 .",
