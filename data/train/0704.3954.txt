    "the study of charmed meson hadronic decays illuminates light meson spectroscopy .",
    "many of these decays proceed via quasi two - body modes and are subsequently observed as three or more stable particles . in this work our goal is to describe the two - body resonances that contribute to the observed three - body @xmath4 decay .",
    "study of a given state can shed light on different production mechanisms .",
    "we present here a study of charged @xmath12 decay to three charged pions carried out with the cleo detector .",
    "this mode has been studied previously by e687  @xcite , e691  @xcite , e791  @xcite , and focus  @xcite .",
    "the analyses from e791 and focus have roughly the same data size as the one described here , while the e687 and e691 analyses used about an order of magnitude smaller samples and are not discussed further .",
    "e791 uses the isobar technique , where each resonant contribution to the dalitz plot  @xcite is modeled as a breit - wigner amplitude with a complex phase .",
    "this works well for narrow , well separated resonances , but when the resonances are wide and start to overlap , solutions become ambiguous , and unitarity is violated . in contrast",
    ", focus uses the k - matrix approach , which gives a description of s wave @xmath11 resonances treating the @xmath13 ( also known as @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 contributions in a unified way .",
    "while this approach is a step forward , some authors @xcite , @xcite have claimed that the exact formalism used by focus violates chiral constraints , and might therefore lead to unphysical behavior at low @xmath11 mass , where the s wave is most prominent . despite the difference in approach the two techniques",
    "give a good description of the observed dalitz plots and agree about the overall contributions of the resonances , as is shown in table  [ tab : compare1 ] .",
    "both experiments see that about half of the fit fraction for this decay is explained by a low @xmath16 mass s wave .",
    "we have in hand a comparable sample of @xmath4 decays ( inclusion of the charge - conjugate mode is always implicit ) ; we can thus check this somewhat surprising result in a significantly different environment .",
    "e791 and focus are fixed target experiments where @xmath12 mesons are produced within a momentum range of 10 - 100  gev/@xmath17 . in our experiment",
    "@xmath18 mesons are produced in the process @xmath19 , close to the threshold , and are thus almost at rest .",
    "this difference of production environments is important for observation of events from the decay @xmath20 , which has a large rate and contributes to the same final state .",
    "these events are easily removed in the fixed target experiments by requiring all three charged pions to be consistent with a common vertex , and its residual contribution was estimated to be small .",
    "we are forced to take a different approach as the lower momentum @xmath21 does not produce clearly detached vertexes when @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless we are able to clearly isolate the @xmath23 channel , using the @xmath16 invariant mass .",
    ".a comparison of the observed fit fractions in % from previous studies of @xmath4 .",
    "the sum of all fit fractions is not necessarily equal to 100% due to the ignored interference terms .",
    "the `` s wave @xmath24 '' entry for e791 is the sum of the three entries above it . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                    [ [ sec : complex_amplitudes ] ] check for @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , etc .",
