    "today , the theory and variants thereof are intensely debated as low - energy theories of u(1 ) dirac spin liquids  @xcite and of quantum critical points between symmetry - protected topological phases  @xcite , as field theory for the half - filled landau level state  @xcite , and as dual descriptions of surface states of topological insulators  @xcite .",
    "qed@xmath7 is believed to exhibit two distinct phases  @xcite .",
    "if the number @xmath0 of massless fermion flavors is large , the theory has an interacting conformal ground state . at low @xmath0 , on the other hand , the fermions are expected to acquire a dynamical mass via spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . obviously ,",
    "knowledge of the true ground state of the theory at a given @xmath0 is indispensable for its interpretation within the condensed - matter applications . since the initial analysis in the 1980 s  @xcite",
    ", many follow - up works have attempted to establish the phase diagram .",
    "these include higher - order @xmath8 calculations  @xcite , various nonperturbative approximations of the dyson - schwinger equations  @xcite , different types of renormalization group ( rg ) calculations  @xcite , and lattice monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",

    "transition towards a chiral - symmetry - broken state .    in this paper , we significantly correct this largely accepted scenario .",
    "our main result is that qed@xmath10 in @xmath11 exhibits an intermediate phase _ between _ the symmetric conformal large-@xmath0 phase and the chiral - symmetry - broken low-@xmath0 phase .",
    "we thus distinguish between the conformal - critical flavor number @xmath9 below which the conformal phase becomes unstable and the chiral - critical flavor number @xmath12 below which chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "in fact , the logical possibility that @xmath12 and @xmath9 could differ had been recognized earlier  @xcite .",

[ at one loop , this leads to @xmath54 . ]",
    "the scaling form of the renormalized photon propagator , then , is @xmath55 , which reproduces the finite photon mass of the schwinger model in @xmath13  @xcite , as well as the @xmath56 behavior in @xmath14  @xcite .",

    "note that we have found that @xmath9 diverges when @xmath71 , in qualitative agreement with the expectation formulated in ref .",
