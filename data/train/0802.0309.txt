    "first of all , from the cancellation of chiral anomalies @xcite and asymptotic freedom in qcd , the 3 - 3 - 1 models can explain why there are three fermion families .",
    "secondly , since the third family is treated under a different representation , the large mass difference between the heaviest quark family and the two lighter ones may be understood third - family .",
    "thirdly , the models have a scalar content similar to the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , which allow to predict the quantization of electric charge and the vectorial character of the electromagnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "also , these models contain a natural peccei - quinn symmetry , necessary to solve the strong - cp problem @xcite .",

    "although not all models with new neutral @xmath1 bosons exhibit additional fcnc contributions @xcite , many interesting ones contain fcnc effects at tree level @xcite . in 3 - 3 - 1 models , the contributions in meson systems",
    "have been considered before @xcite in @xmath7 and @xmath8 systems , which induce the flavor changing transitions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , while no information other than a lower bound associated to the @xmath11 transition was available for the @xmath12 system .",

    "however , since fcnc contribution in these models are very sensitive to the rotations of the fermionic spectrum to mass eigenstates , it is neccesary to implement some criterion to fix the values of the components of the rotation matrices , and to get numerical predictions on the meson mass diference .",
    "in contrast to other studies in @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 systems @xcite , we will consider various cases for the rotation matrix , including the texture - zero approches , where an ansatz on the texture of the femion mass matrices is adopted in agreement with the measured masses and mixing angles of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix . an additional motivation to study the @xmath14 system comes from the fact that the @xmath13 sector induces the maximum flavor - changing contribution , as will be confirmed in this work .",
