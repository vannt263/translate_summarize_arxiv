    "recently , precise measurements of observables in proton - deuteron ( @xmath0 ) elastic scattering have been performed at several energies @xcite for the details of nuclear forces , such as an off - shell difference in realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials or the evidence for three - nucleon forces ( 3nfs ) . for obtaining less ambiguous information from these experimental data ,",

    "<S> a modified version of the faddeev three - body equation to accommodate the coulomb interaction , which was used in the study of three - nucleon bound states , is applied to the proton - deuteron scattering problem at energies below the three - body breakup threshold . </S>",
    "<S> a formal derivation of the equation in a time - independent scattering theory is given . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results for phase shift parameters are presented to be compared with those of another methods and results of the phase shift analysis . </S>",
    "<S> differential cross sections and nucleon analyzing powers are calculated with the effects of three - nucleon forces , and these results are compared with recent experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the nucleon analyzing power in proton - deuteron scattering and that in neutron - deuteron scattering is discussed . </S>"
