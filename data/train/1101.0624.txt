    "there is growing evidence that in addition to its extraordinary electronic properties@xcite , graphene might also be an exciting material for spintronics , a technology that would be based on the spin of electrons rather than on their charge .",
    "the impetus to study spin - related phenomena in graphene comes from two directions : i ) the experiments of tombros _ et al _ ( ref .  )",
    "showed that it was possible to inject spin into mono- and few layers graphene and measure spin signals in a spin - valve setup , and ii ) the recent observation@xcite of band splitting in graphene due to spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) .",
    "although the intrinsic soi@xcite is expected to be weak in graphene ( not exceeding@xcite @xmath1 ) , the breaking of the inversion symmetry by an external electric field or by the presence of a substrate can result in a substantial externally induced soi .",
    "in particular , varykhalov _ et al _ ( ref .  ) reported a spin - orbit interaction induced band splitting of @xmath2 in a quasi - free - standing graphene on ni(111)/au substrate .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling was identified as rashba - type soi@xcite ( rsoi ) and it was attributed to the high nuclear charge of the gold atoms that were intercalated between the ni substrate and the graphene layer to break the strong carbon - nickel bonds and make the graphene layer quasi - free - standing .",
    "the fact that gold intercalation can decouple graphene from the nickel substrate was also supported by density functional calculations@xcite and that it may induce sizeable rashba - type soi was indicated by the computations of ref .  .",
    "furthermore , gold intercalation was used to decouple graphene grown on ru(0001 ) substrate@xcite where a band - gap opening at the dirac - point of the graphene band structure was observed as well .",
    "the appearance of the gap was ascribed to the breaking of the symmetry of the two carbon sublattices in graphene . a gap opening in the graphene band structure",
    "was also found when the strong nickel - graphene bonds were passivated by potassium intercalation@xcite . besides metal surfaces ( for a review see ref .  ) , intensive research effort , both theoretical@xcite and experimental ( see e.g. refs .",
    ", earlier developments are reviewed in ref .  ) , is directed towards studying graphene on sic substrate .",
    "these experiments show therefore that substrates can induce soi and/or open a band gap in monolayer graphene .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is an important experimental technique that provides direct information on the bulk and surface electronic band structure of solid state materials [ see e.g. refs .  ] .",
    "arpes has also become a major tool to study graphene on various substrates@xcite by also measuring the spin polarization of the photoelectrons ( the so called spin - resolved arpes or sarpes technique@xcite ) and using a sophisticated data analysis method@xcite one may observe band splittings smaller than the intrinsic linewidth of regular arpes experiments , providing a powerful tool to measure spin resolved electronic bandstructure .",
    "indeed , sarpes measurements were used in the experiments of refs .   to investigate the spin dependent band splitting in graphene .",
    "our work is motivated by the fact that , as mentioned above , substrates can induce rsoi and/or open band gap in monolayer graphene .",
    "therefore the interplay of the two effects , i.e. the rsoi and sublattice asymmetry induced band gap opening may be important in some systems .",
    "we note that small band - gaps ( by which we mean a few tens of @xmath3 ) are not easily detected by arpes because of the finite experimental resolution ( @xmath4 ) and because of the finite intrinsic linewidth in the measurements .",
    "we theoretically demonstrate that broken carbon sublattice symmetry coupled with rsoi induces a finite out - of plane spin polarization in monolayer graphene , therefore sarpes measurements could detect small band gaps even if conventional arpes can not .",
    "we study the constant - energy angular maps and the spin - resolved momentum distribution curves ( mdc)@xcite of photoelectrons as a function of initial state energy and line - broadening for finite rsoi and sublattice asymmetry induced band - gaps .",
    "our work is therefore complementary to ref .",
    "in which a similar study was published for zero soi and also to ref .",
    "which focused on the effect of rsoi on photoelectrons but the sublattice asymmetry was not considered and the dependence of the mdc - s on initial state energy and line broadening was not discussed in details .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following way : first , in section  [ sec : graphene - bands ] we show that if both rsoi and sublattice asymmetry are present then the quasiparticles in monolayer graphene acquire a non - zero out - of - plane spin polarization in a part of the brillouin zone .",
    "we then show in section  [ sec : sarpes - theor ] how the spin polarization of quasiparticles ( both in and out - of plane ) is related to the spin polarization of photoelectrons .",
    "using these results in section  [ sec : num - sarpes ] we present a numerical study on the initial - state energy and intrinsic line broadening dependence of fixed - energy arpes angular maps and spin - resolved mdc s and we point out the signatures of sublattice asymmetry .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] we discuss the possible experimental relevance of our work and give a short summary .",
    "some details of the calculations in section  [ sec : sarpes - theor ] can be found in appendix  [ sec : matrix_element ] .",
    "in a previous publication@xcite we showed that starting from the tight - binding hamiltonian suggested in ref   to describe rsoi in monolayer graphene one can arrive at the following hamiltonian in the continuum limit at the @xmath5 point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) : @xmath6 [ the bz of graphene with the high symmetry points @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath21 they appear because of the spin - orbit interaction and they lead to trigonal warping of the bands at low energies , i.e. close to the @xmath5 point of the bz .",

    "[ fig : sarpes - highenergy](b ) ] .",

    "we would first briefly comment on the experimental relevance of our results .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a significant spin - orbit coupling was found in gold intercalated ni(111)/graphene system@xcite and the soi was attributed to the presence of the gold atoms .",
    "spin - resolved mdcs were not shown however in ref .  .",
    "subsequently , ref . proved that gold intercalation can decouple graphene from the ru(0001 ) surface as well .",
    "another notable recent development is that gold intercalation has also been used for the si face of sic substrate@xcite where the strong covalent bonds between the sic(0001 ) and the first graphitic layer were suppressed by this method resulting in a slightly p - doped graphene that was only weakly influenced by the substrate .",
    "sarpes measurements were not published in refs .",
    ", though it would be interesting to know if gold can induce soi in these systems as well .",
    "the ru(0001)/gold / graphene system appears to be particularly interesting from our point of view because arpes measurement indicate a band gap @xmath155 , so that if rsoi is non - zero in this system then a finite out - of - plane polarization of photoelectrons should be measurable . a qualitatively similar polarization to the one predicted by this model , with an",
    " abrupt rotation of the spin  at the @xmath156 point of the bz was measured when thallium was deposited on si(111 ) surface@xcite , though ref .   explained the effect by the presence of a local effective magnetic field .",
    "finally , we note that ref .   reported a large and anisotropic spin splitting in graphene , including a nonzero out - of plane polarization component , but the origin of this effect seems to be unclear at the moment .    in summary",
    ", we studied the effect of rsoi and substrate induced sublattice asymmetry on the spin polarization of quasiparticles and of photoelectrons in graphene .",
    "the breaking of @xmath35 sublattice symmetry opens a gap in the band structure of graphene at the @xmath156 point of the bz .",
    "if rsoi is finite , the interplay of the two effects induces a non - zero out - of - plane component of spin polarization of quasiparticles in part of the bz .",
    "rsoi also affects the intensity and spin distribution of photoelectrons , hence it can be studied with the ( s)arpes technique . for strong rsoi ,",
    "the fixed - energy intensity maps taken at low energies , close to the @xmath156 point of the bz , show a characteristic trigonal deformation .",
    "this deformation of the intensity map survives the switching - on of an @xmath35 symmetry breaking potential given by the asymmetry parameter @xmath61 , as long as @xmath61 is much smaller than the rsoi induced band splitting .",
    "our spin - resolved mdcs calculations also show that an important sign of the simultaneous presence of rsoi and sublattice asymmetry is if non - zero out - of - plane photoelectron spin polarization can be measured .",
    "it is important however , especially if @xmath61 and rsoi are small , to choose the energy at which the spin - resolved mdcs are taken as close as possible to the dirac - point , because for energies far from it the out - of - plane polarization remains finite only in the  dark corridor ",
    ", where the low photoelectron intensity would hinder the observation of this effect . a carefully chosen cross - section in the momentum space or a large intrinsic energy broadening may , however , facilitate the observation of the spin @xmath53 polarization in mdcs even at higher energies",
    ". meanwhile , the in - plane components of photoelectron polarization remain qualitatively the same regardless of whether @xmath61 is zero or not .",
    "if the fixed - energy intensity map is obtained at energies larger than the energy separation of two spin - split bands and their intrinsic energy broadening @xmath89 is small compared to their rsoi induced energy splitting , then the resulting arpes calculation shows a double ring - like structure . for large @xmath89",
    ", the two rings may not be discernible any more , but sarpes measurements can nevertheless reveal the true band structure because of the sign - changes in the polarization components .",
