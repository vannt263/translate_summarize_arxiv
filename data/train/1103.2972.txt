    "the coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity is one of the intriguing phenomena in solid - state physics.@xcite apart from the ongoing studies of the underlying microscopic mechanisms,@xcite the effect itself is relevant for applications,@xcite and stimulates extensive experimental work on diverse systems varying from bulk transition - metal compounds @xcite to heterostructures.@xcite magnetoelectric effects in bulk systems typically conform to one of the two following scenarios : ( i ) the magnetism arises from transition - metal cations with a partially filled @xmath12 shell , and the ferroelectricity is driven by lone - pair cations , such as bi@xmath2 or se@xmath13 ( refs .  ) , or",
    "( ii ) electronic effects [ a spiral ( helicoidal ) magnetic structure or a charge ordering ] break the symmetry and cause ferroelectricity.@xcite the former mechanism ensures large electric polarization , which , however , is weakly coupled to the magnetism .",
    "the latter scenario provides a strong coupling , but a small electric polarization .",
    "the combination of the two approaches is clearly advantageous , but difficult to achieve .",
    "the best known example is bifeo@xmath14,@xcite which exhibits a plethora of interesting effects related to the coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism.@xcite     ( color online ) the crystal structure of bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the fe and mn cations are situated in the oxygen octahedra ( in the color version , blue and violet polyhedra denote the femn1 and femn2 positions , respectively ) . ]",
    "the recently discovered complex oxide bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 represents another system combining the two scenarios plausible for multiferroicity : the lone - pair bi@xmath2 cation and the spiral magnetic ground state .",
    "neither of the two , however , lead to ferroelectricity .",
    "the polar displacements of bi@xmath2 are ordered in an antiferroelectric manner,@xcite whereas the spiral magnetic structure is non - polar due to a strong antiferromagnetic coupling along the crystallographic @xmath11 direction .",
    "the unique crystal structure of bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 features fragments of the hypothetical @xmath15 oxygen - based mo building blocks that are related by a mirror operation into a polysynthetically twinned structure.@xcite the fe@xmath2 ( @xmath16 ) and mn@xmath2 ( @xmath17 ) cations are nearly randomly distributed over two crystallographically distinct positions , both octahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms ( fig .",
    "[ structure ] ) .",
    "the octahedra are interconnected into a framework through corner- , edge- , and face - sharing , providing complex paths for the magnetic exchange . in spite of the random distribution of the fe and mn cations ,",
    "a long - range magnetic order was reported in bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 below @xmath3  k , according to @xmath18fe mssbauer spectroscopy , magnetic susceptibility , and heat capacity measurements .",
    "the low - temperature neutron powder diffraction revealed the incommensurate propagation vector of the magnetic structure , yet no details of the ground - state spin arrangement have been reported.@xcite    spiral magnetic structures are capable of inducing ferroelectricity in a number of transition - metal oxides , such as tbmno@xmath14,@xcite ni@xmath14v@xmath0o@xmath19,@xcite mnwo@xmath20,@xcite and ba@xmath21sr@xmath21zn@xmath0fe@xmath22o@xmath23.@xcite in contrast to the aforementioned compounds , bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 remains paraelectric below @xmath24.@xcite to understand the lack of ferroelectricity , we studied the magnetic structure and explored the underlying frustrated spin lattice .",
    "although the strong frustration leads to the formation of magnetic helices propagating along @xmath7 , the unfrustrated antiferromagnetic ( afm ) coupling along @xmath11 induces the 222 point symmetry of the magnetically ordered state and cancels the possible electric polarization .",
    "the powder sample of bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 was synthesized by high - temperature solid - state reaction in air .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of raw materials ( bi@xmath0o@xmath14 , mn@xmath0o@xmath14 , fe@xmath0o@xmath14 ) were ground thoroughly and heated up to 800  @xmath25c  in 5  h. after annealing for 10  h , the powder was reground , pressed into a pellet , and heated at 1000  @xmath25c  for 100  h with several intermediate grindings .",
    "( color online ) neutron diffraction patterns for bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 at different temperatures .",
    "the arrows show the magnetic reflections . ]",
    "neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) data were collected on a @xmath26  g sample of bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 , contained in a 9.5  mm diameter vanadium can . a closed cycle he refrigerator was used for temperature control .",
    "patterns were collected with the bt-1 32-detector high - resolution neutron powder diffractometer at the national institute of standards and technology center for neutron research , gaithersburg , md .",
    "a cu(311 ) monochromator with a @xmath27 takeoff angle and 15 min in - pile collimation was used .",
    "the neutron wavelength was 1.5402(1 )  a. data from the 32 detectors were combined to give pseudo one - detector data over a total scan range of @xmath28 with a step size of @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the magnetic structure was analyzed with the jana2006 program.@xcite    density functional theory ( dft ) band structure calculations were performed in the full - potential local - orbital ( ` fplo ` ) code.@xcite we used local density approximation ( lda)@xcite supplied with a mean - field ( dft+@xmath31 ) correction for correlation effects in the fe / mn 3@xmath12 shell . the @xmath32-mesh comprised 192 points for the 40-atom unit cell and 64 points for the 80-atom supercell .",
    "the correlated shell was parameterized with an effective on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath33  ev and exchange @xmath34  ev,@xcite whereas the double - counting was corrected in the fully - localized - limit ( atomic limit ) fashion . to evaluate individual exchange couplings , total energies for a number of collinear spin configurations",
    "were mapped onto a classical heisenberg model .",
    "the validity of the computational results was checked by calculations within generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite and by choosing @xmath35 values of 4 and 6  ev . similar to cu@xmath36 oxides,@xcite the exchange - correlation potential ( lda @xmath37 gga )",
    "has marginal effect on the spin model , whereas a change in @xmath35 only shifts the exchange couplings in a systematic way and keeps their ratios nearly constant .",
    "the dft - based spin model was further studied by classical monte - carlo simulations with the ` spinmc ` algorithm of the alps package.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we consider the fe@xmath2 case first .",
    "the normalized spin - spin correlation for @xmath38 is close to @xmath39 ; therefore , the interlayer ordering is collinear and afm .",
    "similar correlations on the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bonds indicate the same propagation vector along @xmath7 for the femn1 and femn2 sublattices .",
    "further on , similar correlations on the @xmath42 and @xmath43 as well as on @xmath44 and @xmath45 bonds signify the same magnetic order along the respective bonds and , consequently , a twice shorter periodicity along @xmath7 for the magnetic unit cell compared to the crystallographic unit cell . to find out the ordering pattern along @xmath46 , we note that the respective femn2 atoms are connected via @xmath42 and @xmath43 or @xmath44 and @xmath45 bonds .",
    "the correlations along these paths are different ; therefore , the spins on the femn2 atoms should be parallel ( i.e. , the magnetic moment rotates for a certain angle @xmath47 on the @xmath42 bond and for the opposite angle @xmath48 on the @xmath43 bond ) . thus , the propagation vector of the magnetic structure is @xmath49 $ ] , in agreement with the experiment .",
    "the principal spin arrangement is described by three parameters , which are the angles between the spins on the @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 , and @xmath44 bonds . according to our simulations , these angles are @xmath50  deg , @xmath51  deg , and @xmath52  deg , respectively , in remarkable agreement with the experimental values of @xmath53  deg , @xmath54  deg , and @xmath55  deg . our microscopic model for bife@xmath14o@xmath1 reproduces the experimental magnetic structure of bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 quite well .",
    "the remaining discrepancies are likely related to the partial replacement of fe by mn .",
    "the complete substitution of mn for fe changes the magnetic ground state . according to table [ correlations ] ,",
    "most of the normalized spin - spin correlations in bimn@xmath14o@xmath1 are close to + 1 .",
    "the only negative correlation refers to the @xmath38 bond and indicates afm interlayer coupling .",
    "the intralayer ordering is now collinear fm due to predominantly fm exchange couplings ( @xmath56 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath41 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , see table [ couplings ] ) .",
    "the spin lattice is still frustrated by afm couplings @xmath57 and @xmath40 , which , however , are not strong enough to induce the spiral order . while bife@xmath14o@xmath1 and bimn@xmath14o@xmath1 present two opposite scenarios of strong and weak frustration , respectively , bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 lies between these distinct regimes .",
    "the spiral ground state of this compound is driven by the frustration of intralayer exchange couplings that remain predominantly afm for mixed fe  o  mn superexchange pathways ( see table [ couplings ] ) .",
    "for an additional test of our microscopic model , we calculated magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath58 ) and estimated the nel temperature @xmath24 as the position of the kink in the temperature dependence of @xmath58 . transition temperatures for bife@xmath14o@xmath1 ( 420  k ) and bimn@xmath14o@xmath1 ( 150  k ) reasonably agree with the experimental @xmath24 of 220  k that lies between the two calculated values .",
    "our experimental and computational study provides microscopic insight into the physics of bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this compound features a strongly frustrated spin lattice with predominantly afm exchange couplings that induce the spiral magnetic order .",
    "the comparison between bife@xmath14o@xmath1 and bimn@xmath14o@xmath1 suggests that afm exchange couplings are an essential prerequisite for the spiral magnetic order .",
    "the crystal structure itself may still allow for different ground states ; therefore , it is the transition - metal cation that determines the type of the long - range magnetic order . in this respect ,",
    "first reports on cation substitution@xcite look promising , because the change in the fe / mn ratio or an incorporation of other magnetic cations could alter the magnetic structure and other physical properties .",
    "bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 is a magnetic compound that conforms to two mechanisms of ferroelectricity .",
    "first , lone pairs of bi@xmath2 induce polar displacements .",
    "second , the non - collinear magnetic structure breaks the inversion symmetry and allows for magnetic - field - induced electric polarization .",
    "however , none of the two mechanisms succeed in rendering the compound ferroelectric . bi@xmath2-related polar displacements form an antiferroelectric pattern that leads to zero net polarization .",
    "the electronic mechanism meets a similar obstacle of the afm interlayer coupling and the ensuing non - polar ( albeit non - centrosymmetric ) magnetic structure .",
    "the lack of polarity in both atomic and magnetic structures naturally explains the absence of the ferroelectric response in bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 below @xmath24.@xcite    our results demonstrate that the simple criteria of ferroelectricity and multiferroicity are not universal , since the polarization induced by any kind of polar distortion ( atomic displacement or spin spiral ) can be wiped out by an overall antiferroelectric / antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the combination of lone - pair and transition - metal cations does not necessarily lead to a magnetic ferroelectric , whereas an arbitrary incommensurate magnetic structure may not allow for the electronic mechanism of ferroelectricity .",
    "these simple observations make the search for multiferroics a challenge , and put forward the charge - ordering mechanism as a more robust approach to the design of magnetoelectric materials .    the cancellation of polarity in an incommensurate magnetic structure has been proposed for the spin - chain cuprate nacu@xmath0o@xmath0@xcite and for a number of layered compounds , such as @xmath59-cacr@xmath0o@xmath20@xcite and , @xcite that were considered as potential multiferroics .",
    "the non - frustrated afm interlayer coupling seems to be a general obstacle for ferroelectricity in layered systems , like @xmath59-cacr@xmath0o@xmath20,@xcite or in three - dimensional systems with two - dimensional frustrated units , as in bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 . to overcome this problem",
    ", one has to design materials with fm or frustrated interlayer couplings . in the case of bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "cation substitutions preserve the long - range order @xcite and can be promising for tuning this compound toward ferroelectric and possibly multiferroic behavior .    in summary",
    ", we have solved the spiral magnetic structure of bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 and proposed a microscopic magnetic model for this compound .",
    "the ground state features spins lying in the @xmath8 plane and propagating along @xmath7 by a @xmath60 deg rotation about the @xmath7 axis .",
    "the two inequivalent femn positions reveal the same propagation vector .",
    "the spiral magnetic structure is driven by the strong frustration of antiferromagnetic exchange couplings on a complex spin lattice in the @xmath10 plane . however , the coupling along the @xmath11 direction is non - frustrated , leading to antiparallel spin arrangement in neighboring layers .",
    "the resulting magnetic structure is non - polar and , alike the centrosymmetric ( antiferroelectric ) atomic structure , precludes the ferroelectric behavior of bimnfe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
