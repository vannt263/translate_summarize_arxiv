    "alternatively , there is a theory which induces the electroweak symmetry breaking by dynamically .",
    "this is a technicolor theory  @xcite which predicts the existence of the new strong force ( technicolor ) and new fermions ( technifermions ) , and does not require elementary scalar bosons .",
    "technicolor interact between technifermions to form the bound states ( technihadrons ) such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , analogous to the mesons on qcd . in @xmath4 collisions at tevatron ,",

    "for this analysis , we use a data sample corresponding to approximately @xmath6 of integrated luminosity accumulated in the cdf ii detector at the fermilab tevatron  @xcite .",
    "the events are collected with high-@xmath21 electron or muon triggers , which can detect electrons or muons with @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "we further require the electron or muon that is isolated with @xmath22 or @xmath24 at offline level .    to select the @xmath3 + 2jets final state",
    ", we require that events have the large missing transverse energy and one or two @xmath7-jets .",
    "therefore , we require that events have @xmath25 and exactly two jets , where jets are defined using a cone algorithm with radius @xmath26 .",
    "we count jets which have @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    to reduce the background , we require that at least one jet in the event are identified as @xmath7-jet by the secondary vertex tagging algorithm .",
    "the secondary vertex tagging algorithm identifies @xmath7-jets by fitting tracks displaced from the primary vertex .",
    "this method has been used by other analyses at cdf  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we add the jet probability tagging algorithm that identifies @xmath7-jets by requireing a low probability that all tracks contained in a jet originated from the primary vertex , based on the track impact parameters  @xcite . to be considered for double tag category",
    ", we require that events have two secondary vertex tagged jets or one secondary vertex tagged jet and one jet probability tagged jet .",
    "to increase the signal acceptance , we also make use of the exactly one @xmath7-tagged events with secondary vertex tagging algorithm . for the exactly one @xmath7-tagged events",

    ", we can improve the purity of @xmath7-jets while keeping about 90% signal .",
    "the dijet mass is reconstructed from the 2 jets in selected events . to reconstruct the @xmath3 + 2jets invariant mass , we need to determine the @xmath30 of the neutrino from the @xmath3 boson . after using the @xmath3 mass constraint to solve for the kinematics of the @xmath31 system , we take a smaller value of the two @xmath30 solutions .",

    ", we use the default value in pythia . for this study",
    ", we focus on the mass region as : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 because of the kinematical threshold of @xmath38 production and pair @xmath17 production .    for the systematic uncertainties of signal acceptance , we consider the effects from lepton identification , trigger , the @xmath7-tagging efficiency , initial and final state radiation effects ( isr / fsr ) , parton distribution function ( pdf ) and the jet energy scale ( jes ) .",
    "lepton identification uncertainty is less than 2% , trigger uncertainty is less than 1% , isr / fsr uncertainty is 1.8 - 11.6% , jes uncertainty is 2.7 - 11.3% , pdf uncertainty is 2.3 - 3.8% and b - tagging uncertainty is 4.3 - 17.0% , respectively .",
    "this analysis builds on the method of background estimation detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular , the contributions from the following individual backgrounds are calculated : falsely @xmath7-tagged events ( mistag ) , @xmath3 production with heavy flavor quarks ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , qcd events with false @xmath3 signatures ( nonw ) , top quark pair or single production ( @xmath42 , single top ) and diboson production ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "we estimate the mistag events by using the mistag probability that measured from the inclusive jets sample .",
    "such mistag rate are obtained using negative tags , which are the tags that appear to travel back toward the primary vertex .",
    "the mistag rate derived from negative tags is due to tracking resolution limitations , but they provide a reasonable estimate of the number of false positive tags after a correction for material interactions and long - lived light flavor particles .",
    "the number of events from @xmath3 + heavy flavor is calculated using information from both data and monte carlo samples .",
    "we calculate the fraction of @xmath3 events with associated heavy flavor production in the alpgen monte carlo program interfaced with the pythia parton shower code  @xcite .",
    "this fraction and the tagging efficiency for such events are applied to the number of events in the original @xmath3+jets sample after correcting for the @xmath46 and electroweak contributions .",
    "we constrain the number of qcd events with false @xmath3 signatures by assuming the lepton isolation is independent of @xmath47 and measuring the ratio of isolated to non - isolated leptons in a @xmath47 sideband region . the result in the tagged sample",
    "can be calculated in two ways : by applying the method directly to the tagged sample , or by estimating the number of non - w qcd events in the pretag sample and applying an average @xmath7-tagging rate .",
    "we perform a direct search for a resonant mass peak in the reconstructed @xmath8-jets and dijet invariant mass distributions from the single - tagged and double - tagged events .",
    "since there is no significant excess of events in the data compared to the predicted background , we set the 95% c.l .",
