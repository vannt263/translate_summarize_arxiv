    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations has provided us with convincing evidences for massive neutrinos and leptonic flavor mixing with high degree of accuracy@xcite . the recent measurement of large reactor mixing angle @xmath0 has not only open the door for us to explore the leptonic cp violation and the mass hierarchy in the future experiments , but also highlight the flavor puzzle of neutrino mass and mixing pattern which appears to be rather different from the distinct mass hierarchy and the small mixing angles shown by quarks .",
    "although a full theory is still missing , several ideas have been proposed by reducing the number of free parameters of seesaw models@xcite and introducing the specific structures into mass matrices to explain the observed leptonic mixing pattern .",
    "the models include texture zeros@xcite , hybrid textures@xcite , zero trace@xcite , zero determinant@xcite , vanishing minors@xcite , two traceless submatrices@xcite , equal elements or cofactors@xcite , hybrid @xmath1 textures@xcite . among these models , the textures with zero elements or zero minors are particularly interesting because of their connection to the flavor symmetries and the stable behavior of running renomalization group .",
    "the phenomenological analysis of neutrino mass matrices with texture zeros or cofactor zeros in flavor basis have been widely investigated in earlier literature@xcite",
    ".    however , there is no priori requirement that the analysis must be done in flavor basis .",
    "the more general situation should be considered in the basis where both charged lepton mass matrix @xmath2 and neutrino mass matrix @xmath3 are non - diagonal . in this spirit",
    ", the parallel @xmath4 has been proposed where @xmath2 and @xmath3 have the same structure ( we denote it `` parallel texture structure '' ) .",
    "a popular parallel texture structure appears as the fritzsch - like model@xcite with texture zeros in mass matrix and is firstly applied to understand the quark mixing pattern .",
    "subsequently the idea is generalized to the lepton sector@xcite . a systematic search on the parallel structures with texture zeros in lepton mass matrices",
    "are reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is shown that some sets of the texture zeros have no physical meaning by themselves , since they can be obtained by making suitable weak basis ( wb ) transformation from arbitrary mass matrix and leaving the gauge currents invariant .",
    "the minimal no trivial case is the four texture zeros model .",
    "recently , a similar investigation is done in the context of parallel hybrid textures with one zero and two equal elements @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the parallel structures with two cofactor zeros in both @xmath3 and @xmath3 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cofactor zeros in @xmath3 are generated by the type - i seesaw formula @xmath5 with texture zeros in @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the cofactor zeros in @xmath2 , on the other hand , seems to be rather unusual because no flavor symmetry directly leads to the cofactor zeros of dirac mass matrix @xmath2 .",
    "however , we will show that if we adopt the recent viewpoint proposed by ma@xcite that the radiated lepton mass originate from the one - loop diagram , a seesaw - like formula is possible for charged lepton masses and the cofactor zeros in @xmath2 can be realized .",
    "there exists @xmath8 logically possible patterns .",
    "furthermore , we assume the mass matrices to be hermitian and all neutrinos are massive , which indicates det@xmath9 and existence of @xmath1 . thus the mass textures @xmath3 with cofactor zeros are equivalent to the @xmath1 with texture zeros . as the texture zero case @xcite",
    ", the 15 textures structures can be grouped into 4 classes with each class having the same physical implications . among the 4 classes",
    ", we find that one of them is not viable phenomenologically and another class is equal to the matrices with texture zeros .",
    "therefore we focus on the other two classes having not been studied before .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the classification of textures and relate them to the experimental results . in sec.iii , we diagonalize the mass matrices , confront the numerical results with the experimental data and discuss their predictions . in sec .",
    "iv , the the realization of cofactor zeros in @xmath2 is discussed .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "we assume the neutrinos to be majorana fermions .",
    "the most general wb transformations leaving gauge currents invariant is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are @xmath13 unitary matrices .",
    "therefore the parallel texture with cofactor zeros located at different positions can be related by permutation matrix @xmath14 as the wb transformation    @xmath15    the permutation matrix @xmath14 changes the positions of cofactor zeros but preserves the parallel structures for both charged lepton and neutrino mass textures .",
    "it is noted that @xmath14 belongs to the group of 6 permutations and are isomorphic to @xmath16 .",
    "then the four cofactor zeros texture can be classified into 4 classes as following :    class i : @xmath17    class ii : @xmath18    class iii : @xmath19    class iv : @xmath20 where `` @xmath21 '' at @xmath22 position denotes the zero cofactor @xmath23 while `` @xmath24 '' stands for arbitrary element . since @xmath25 with cofactor zeros",
    "is equivalent to @xmath26 with zero elements , the classification given above is the same as the texture zero ones shown in ref.@xcite except for replacing `` @xmath21 '' with `` 0 '' . like the texture",
    "zero cases , the class iv leads to the decoupling of a generation of lepton from mixing and thus not experimentally viable . on the other hand , one can easily check that the textures of class i correspond to the texture zero ones , which has already studied in previous literature@xcite . as an example , for the first matrix of class i , we have @xmath27 therefore only class ii and class iii have no trivial physical implications .",
    "as we have mentioned , we only need to investigate two mass matrices respectively belonging to to representations of class ii and class iii . in this work ,",
    "we choose @xmath28 the charged leptonic mass texture @xmath2 is a complex hermitian matrix and the majorana neutrino mass texture @xmath3 is a complex symmetric matrix .",
    "they are diagonalized by unitary matrix @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix@xcite @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 and can be parameterized as @xmath36 where the abbreviations @xmath37 and @xmath38 are used .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 in @xmath41 denote two majorana cp - violating phases and @xmath42 in u denotes the dirac cp - violating phase . in order to facilitate our calculation , it is better to start from @xmath43 rather than @xmath2 . from , we get @xmath44 so the @xmath29 can not only diagonalize the @xmath2 but also @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , we treat the hermitian matrix @xmath43 to be factorisable .",
    "i.e @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the unitary phase matrix and can be parameterized as @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 becomes a real symmetric matrix which can be diagonalized by real orthogonal matrix @xmath49 .",
    "then we have @xmath50 and @xmath51 from , and , the neutrino mass matrix @xmath3 is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 . from the restriction of two cofactor zeros on @xmath3 @xmath54 induces two equations @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 @xmath58 with @xmath59 a cyclic permutation of ( 1,2,3 ) . after solving eq . and , we arrive at @xmath60 @xmath61    with the help of eq . and",
    ", we obtain the magnitudes of mass radios @xmath62 @xmath63 as well as the two majorana cp - violating phases @xmath64 @xmath65 the results of eq",
    ". , , and imply that the two mass ratios ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) and two majorana cp - violating phases ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) are fully determined in terms of the real orthogonal matrix @xmath49 and @xmath68(@xmath69 and @xmath42 ) . the neutrino mass ratios @xmath66 and @xmath67 are related to the ratios of two neutrino mass - squared ratios obtained from the solar and atmosphere oscillation experiments as @xmath70 and to the three neutrino mass as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in the numerical analysis , we use the latest global - fit neutrino oscillation experimental data , at 3@xmath67 confidential level , which is listed in ref.@xcite @xmath74 for normal hierarchy ( nh ) and @xmath75 for inverted hierarchy(ih ) .",
    "there is no constraint on the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath42 at @xmath76 level , however , the recent global fit tends to give @xmath77 . in neutrino oscillation experiments ,",
    "cp violation effect is usually reflected by the jarlskog rephasing invariant quantity@xcite defined as @xmath78 the majorana nature of neutrino can be determined if any signal of neutrinoless double decay is observed , implying the violation of leptonic number violation .",
    "the decay ratio is related to the effective of neutrino @xmath79 , which is written as @xmath80 although a @xmath76 result of @xmath81 ev is reported by the heidelberg - moscow collaboration@xcite , this result is criticized in ref @xcite and shall be checked by the forthcoming experiment .",
    "it is believed that that the next generation @xmath82 experiments , with the sensitivity of @xmath83 being up to 0.01 ev@xcite , will open the window to not only the absolute neutrino mass scale but also the majorana - type cp violation . besides the @xmath82 experiments , a more severe constraint was set from the recent cosmology observation .",
    "recently , an upper bound on the sum of neutrino mass @xmath84 ev is reported by plank collaboration@xcite combined with the wmap , high - resolution cmb and bao experiments .",
    "in this section , we study the phenomenological implications of class ii . the factorisable formation of inverse charged leptonic matrix ( @xmath85 are parameterized as @xmath86 and can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix @xmath49 @xmath87 where the coefficients @xmath88 are real and positive ; the @xmath89 and @xmath90 denote the masse eigenvalues of charged leptons for three generations .",
    "the minus sign in has been introduced to facilitate the analytical calculation and has no physical meaning since the charged lepton is dirac fermions . using the invariant tr@xmath48 , det@xmath91 and tr@xmath92",
    "the nozero elements of @xmath48 can be expressed in terms of three mass eigenvalues @xmath93 , @xmath90 and @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 where the parameter @xmath94 is allowed in the range of @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "then the @xmath49 can be easily constructed as @xmath100 where the @xmath101 and @xmath102 in is given in , and ; the @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the normalized coefficients given by @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 substitute the @xmath49 we obtained into to , , , and , the ratio of mass squared difference can be expressed via eight parameters .",
    "i.e three mixing angles @xmath109 , one dirac cp - violating phase @xmath42 , three charged lepton mass @xmath110 and a parameter @xmath94 .",
    "here we choose the three charged leptonic masses at the electroweak scale(@xmath111 ) i.e@xcite @xmath112 in the numerical analysis , we randomly vary the three mixing angles @xmath109 in their @xmath76 range and parameter @xmath94 in its proper range . up to now , no bound was set on dirac cp - violating phase @xmath42 at 3 @xmath67 level , so we vary it randomly in the range of @xmath113 $ ] . using eq . , the mass - squared difference ratio @xmath114 is determined .",
    "then the input parameters is empirically acceptable when the @xmath114 falls inside the the @xmath76 range of experimental data , otherwise they are excluded .",
    "finally , we get the value of neutrino mass and majorana cp - violating phase @xmath39 and @xmath40 though eq . , . since we have already obtained the absolute neutrino mass @xmath115 , the further constraint from cosmology should be considered . in this work",
    ", we set the upper bound on the sum of neutrino mass @xmath116 less than 0.23 ev .",
    "we present the numerical results of class ii in fig.[iinh ] for the nh and in fig.[iiih ] for the ih .",
    "one can see from the figures that different mass spectra exhibit different correlations between physical variables . for the nh case",
    ", the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath42 is highly restricted in the range of @xmath117 and leads to the jarlskog rephasing invariant @xmath118 which is promising to be detected in the future long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "on the other hand , there exists a bound of @xmath119 .",
    "although accepted at 3@xmath67 level , this result is phenomenologically ruled out at @xmath120 level since recent experiments tend to give @xmath121 .",
    "we obtain the bound on the lightest neutrino mass @xmath122 , @xmath123 and the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath79 @xmath124 which reaches the accuracy of future neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath125 experiments .",
    "the correlation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 is also illustrated that the small range is allowed at @xmath76 level . for the ih case ,",
    "the three mixing angles @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath0 are fully covered the @xmath76 range while the constrained dirac cp - violated phase @xmath42 lies in the range of @xmath128 , leading to the @xmath129 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath79 and the lightest neutrino mass @xmath130 exhibit a strong dependence on @xmath42 .",
    "such correlations are essential for the model selection and could be tested by experiments .",
    "there also exists a bound of @xmath131 which could be in principle tested by future @xmath82 experiments .",
    "the majorana phase @xmath39 is covered in the whole range of @xmath132 while @xmath40 is constrained in the range of @xmath133 .",
    "let s consider another class of textures which is phenomenologically interesting .",
    "in the factorisable case , the real matrix @xmath48 is parameterized as @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath94 are real number . without loss of generality ,",
    "the parameter @xmath136 are set to be positive.the matrix can be diagonalized by the orthogonal matrix @xmath49 @xmath137 different from class ii , we choose @xmath138 as the free parameter since the trace of @xmath48 has already fixed @xmath94 to be @xmath139 using the invariant det@xmath91 and tr@xmath92 , the parameters @xmath140 can be expressed by three charged leptonic mass eigenvalues@xmath141 and @xmath138 @xmath142 with the help of eq . and",
    "eq . , one can construct the diagonalized matrix @xmath49 to be @xmath143 where @xmath144 and the normalized coefficients is given by @xmath145 from the condition that @xmath136 are real and positive , we have the free parameter @xmath138 allowed in the range of @xmath146 or @xmath147    now we repeat the previous analysis .",
    "the class iii with inverted hierarchy are now found to be unacceptable by current experimental data .",
    "we present the allowed region for class iii with normal mass hierarchy in fig.[iiinh ] .",
    "it is observed that no bound is set on @xmath126 and @xmath0 .",
    "however the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath42 is restricted in two regions .",
    "we denote them respectively as r1 : @xmath148 and r2 : @xmath149 .",
    "each shows different predictions . in r1 ,",
    "@xmath127 varies in its @xmath76 range .",
    "we obtain a highly suppressed @xmath150ev which is beyond the accuracy of future @xmath82 experiments and implies the underlying cancelation of three neutrino masses in @xmath79 .",
    "there also exists the lower bound on the lightest neutrino mass @xmath151 . on the other hand , in r2",
    "we find @xmath152 which is supported by @xmath120 experimental constraint .",
    "we also obtain @xmath153 .",
    "moveover , the bound on @xmath79 is founded in the range of @xmath154ev @xmath155ev and can be potentially detected by future experiment .",
    "one reminds the type - i seesaw mechanism as @xmath156 .",
    "then the cofactor zeros of @xmath3 are attributed to the texture zeros in @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "generally , this can be easily realized by abelian @xmath157 flavor symmetry@xcite .",
    "can the cofactor zeros in @xmath2 arise using the same way ? at the tree level , it is obviously impossible . at the loop level , the answer is yes !",
    "here we adopt the model proposed by ma@xcite , consisting of the sm extended by adding three dirac singlet neutral fermion @xmath158 , a doublet scalar @xmath159 and a charged singlet @xmath160 . in ma s model , the particles transforms under the proper @xmath161 gauge symmetry and @xmath162 flavor symmetry . here",
    ", we choose the @xmath163 instead of @xmath162 flavor symmetry under which @xmath164 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 are odd . to forbid the tree level dirac lepton mass ,",

    "the charged leptons acquire the radiated masses via the seesaw - like mechanism and masses of heavy dirac neutral particles @xmath164 play the role of seesaw scale .",
    "consider now the weak basis where the mass matrix of @xmath186 is not diagonal .",
    "it is obvious that , working in the context of the seesaw - like mechanism with a diagonal dirac matrices @xmath187 and @xmath188 , the vanishing cofactors in the charged lepton mass matrix are equivalent to texture zeros in the heavy dirac fermion mass matrix @xmath186 . as having done in neutrino sector ,",
    "the texture zeros in @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath186 are easily achieved by introducing extra @xmath157 flavor symmetries .",

    "these matrices can not obtained from arbitrary hermitian texture by making wb transformations . using the permutation transformation ,",
    "the 15 possible textures are grouped into 4 classes where the matrices in each class lead to the same physical implications . among the 4 classes ,",
    "one of them is not compatible with experimental results and another is equivalent to the texture zero structures explored extensively in previous literature .",
    "we focus on the other two classes ( class ii and class iii ) . using the new results from the neutrino oscillation and cosmology experiments , a systematic and phenomenological analysis",

    "we have demonstrated that some predictions for the atmosphere mixing angle @xmath127 , the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath42 and the majorana effective neutrino mass @xmath79 are rather interesting and deserve to be explored in the future experiments .",
    "we also demonstrate how the cofactor zeros arise in a seesaw - like model where charged lepton mass are generated at one - loop level .",
    "we expect that a cooperation between phenomenological study and the flavor symmetry study will finally help us real the structure of leptonic texture",
