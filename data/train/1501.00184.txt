    "according to ads / cft correspondence @xcite , asymptotically five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads@xmath0 ) black holes describe the dynamics of finite temperature phases of four dimensional gauge theories @xcite .",
    "phenomena such as confinement , thermalization , and phase transitions are all described holographically in terms of classical black hole geometries in ads space . in the study of holographic superconductors , for instance",
    ", the gravity dual description is that of a scalar field condensating around an asymptotically ads black hole at sufficiently low temperature @xcite . when forming in the bulk , the scalar hair induces the expectation value of operators in the dual field theory .",
    "the relation between bulk and boundary phases makes that solving the backreacting problem in the ads black hole background analytically is of big interest , as it would provide a detailed description of finite temperature regimes of strongly coupled systems and , in particular , their phase transitions .",
    "unfortunately , solving the problem taking into account backreaction is highly non - trivial , and the models in which one can actually do so explicitly are limited and hard to come up with .",
    "however , a notably simple scenario in which the problem can be solved analytically is provided by general relativity ( gr ) coupled to conformally coupled scalar field matter . in fact",
    ", this model does admit hairy black holes in asymptotically flat and asymptotically ( a)ds spaces in arbitrary dimensions @xmath1 , @xcite .",
    "the scalar field configuration of these hairy black holes is regular everywhere outside and on the horizon , and in the case of negative cosmological constant it behaves asymptotically in a manner that respects the ads boundary conditions relevant for ads / cft . in this paper",
    ", we will study the thermodynamics of these hairy black hole solutions and , in particular , their phase transition .",
    "we will show that , at high temperature , black holes with non - vanishing scalar hair configurations are thermodynamically favored with respect to the non - hairy schwarzschild - ads@xmath0 solution and thermal ads@xmath0 . below certain critical temperature ,",
    "the theory undergoes a phase transition of the hawking - page type @xcite and the dominant configuration happens to be thermal ads@xmath0 .",
    "the presence of the scalar conformal field also changes the thermodynamics of the theory at short distance :  in particular , we will show that , unlike what happens in gr in absence of matter , small black holes with conformally coupled scalar hair with arbitrarily low temperature exist in ads@xmath0 .",
    "these small black holes present a positive specific heat , and , as a consequence of that , become stable under hawking radiation , yielding a remnant with finite mass .",
    "however , these small black holes are not stable under tunneling transitions ; for the range of temperatures they exhibit , the free energy of thermal ads@xmath0 is actually lower .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  in section ii we introduce the theory , consisting of scalar field matter conformally coupled to gr in five dimensions . in section iii",
    "we review the main properties of the hairy black hole solutions in ads@xmath0 space . in section",
    "iv we compute the mass of these black holes using the hamiltonian formalism , which we later confirm by using euclidean action methods . in section v , we study the thermodynamics of ads@xmath0 black holes including the effects of the scalar field hair . in section",
    "vi , we consider the euclidean action in the saddle point approximation and derive the mass , the entropy , and the free energy of the hairy black hole solutions .",
    "this allows us to study , in section vii , the phase transitions between different configurations that coexist at different ranges of temperature .",
    "we present our conclusions in section viii .",
    "in @xmath2 space - time dimensions we consider the action@xmath3 where @xmath4 and where @xmath5 represents the lagrangian of a conformally coupled real scalar field . apart from the requirement of conformal invariance",
    ", the matter lagrangian is chosen in a way it yields second order field equations . provided these requirements , @xmath5 can be identified uniquely @xcite .    to express the conformal matter content in a succinct way , it is convenient to introduce the four - rank tensor in eq .",

    "the theory defined by action ( [ i ] ) admits analytic black hole solutions with non - vanishing scalar field @xcite . these solutions co - exist with those of gr , that also solve ( [ gt])-([eqfieldarb ] )  with @xmath25 .",
    "the hairy ( @xmath26 )  black hole solutions , which admit horizons of diverse topology , are known analytically and present interesting properties , especially a very interesting thermodynamics .",
    "the scalar field configuration is regular everywhere outside and on the horizon , and backreacts on the metric in such a way that the mass of the black hole remains finite .",
    "moreover , the scalar field and the deformation of the metric due to its backreaction vanish at large distance sufficiently fast for the ( a)ds asymptotics not to result distorted .",
    "the metric of these black hole solutions take the form @xmath27 with @xmath28 and where @xmath29 is the metric of the unit @xmath30-sphere , which has volume @xmath31 . here , we will be concerned with the case @xmath32 . solution ( [ g1])-([g2 ] ) shares some features with the lower - dimensional hairy black holes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the scalar hair configuration is@xmath33 which is regular everywhere but at the origin .",
    "the scalar field backreacts on the geometry through the term @xmath34 in ( [ g2 ] ) , which , as said , does not spoil the ads@xmath0 asymptotic behavior of the metric near the boundary .",
    "parameter @xmath35 in ( [ g2 ] )  is an arbitrary integration constant , while @xmath12 in ( [ phi ] ) and @xmath36 in ( [ g2 ] ) are fixed in terms of the couplings @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) by the following relations @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "conditions ( [ conditions ] ) and the field equations also imply a special relation between the coupling constants @xmath37 , which are constrained to obey the equation @xmath41 see @xcite for a discussion . this can be phrasing as the solution ( [ g1])-([phi ] ) , which exists in the theory defined at the point ( [ trecebis ] ) of the parameter space , represents a particle - like object with _",
    "charge _ taking only three possible values : @xmath42 ,",
    "@xmath43 , or @xmath44 ( that is to say , @xmath12 in ( [ phi ] ) takes the values @xmath45 , @xmath43 , or @xmath46 ) .",
    "however , the solution with @xmath47 is somehow patohological ; consequently , here we will mainly focus in the case @xmath48 .",
    "before going into the discussion of thermodynamics , let us compute the mass of the black hole solution ( [ g1])-([g2 ] ) .",
    "the most convenient way to do this is resorting to the hamiltonian formalism and working in the minisuperspace approach .",
    "one evaluates the action functional in an ansatz compatible with the stationary configuration ( [ g1 ] ) and integrates in time in an interval ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "the lapse function @xmath51 in ( [ g1 ] ) enters as a lagrange multiplier whose coefficient , when varying the action , gives the variation of the energy .",
    "then , the method is varying the action and isolating the term proportional to @xmath51 taking care of boundary terms appropriately -derivatives of @xmath51 appear in the expression and one gets rid of them by integrating by parts- .",
    "the variation of the action finally reads @xmath52 with @xmath53 . from this",
    ", one reads the boundary term @xmath54 needed in the action to cancel the variation ;  and since @xmath51 is the lagrange multiplier proportional to the conserved energy , one reads from ( [ trece ] ) the value of the mass @xmath55 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a constant to be determined .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath57 is that of the energy of the background respect to which one measures the black hole mass .",
    "a natural proposal for @xmath57 is , of course , this to be zero .",
    "however , there are in principle other possibilities . for instance , another choice for @xmath57 could be the minimum value of the parameter @xmath58 for which the geometry exhibits a horizon .",
    "we will discuss this point latter , when rederiving ( [ m1 ] ) with the euclidean action method and obtaining @xmath59 .",
    "mass ( [ m1 ] ) also agrees with what stated in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath35 , parameter @xmath36 does not yield a conserved charge , but , up to the sign @xmath60 , its value is fixed in terms of the coupling constants @xmath37 , which , in addition , obey a specific relation among them for the black hole solution to exist .",
    "the hawking temperature associated to black hole solution ( [ g1])-([g2 ] ) is given by @xmath61 where we denoted @xmath62 .",
    "in the case @xmath63 , this expression reduces to that of schwarzschild - ads@xmath0 black holes , presenting a minimum value @xmath64 for black holes with horizon radius @xmath65 . for negative values of @xmath12 , in contrast",
    ", the temperature as a function of @xmath66 may also present a maximun @xmath67 at a smaller radius , and then the sign of the specific heat becomes positive again at shorter radii .",
    "this implies that , for negative @xmath36 , small mass black holes exist for which the evaporation time becomes infinite . unlike gr in ads , in this theory black holes exist with arbitrarly low ( positive ) temperature -although it does not imply they are stable against tunneling , as we will discuss .    temperature ( [ t ] ) has extrema when @xmath68 .",
    "notice also that the temperature behaves like that of the asymptotically schwarzschild - ads black hole for distance larger that @xmath69 provided @xmath70 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath71 , for sufficiently small black holes , @xmath72 , the behavior differs substantially from that of schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the presence of the hair parameter @xmath36 represents short distance corrections in the theory .",
    "the behavior resembles that of asymptotically flat schwarzschild black hole only in the range between scales @xmath73 .    in general , for both signs of @xmath36 and for certain range of temperatures , eight different solutions in the theory with the same temperature may exist .",
    "that is , apart from the three solutions of gr with @xmath74 , namely the large and small schwarzschild - ads@xmath0 black holes and thermal ads@xmath0 space , there exist three hairy black hole solutions with charge @xmath71 ( @xmath75 ) and two hairy black hole solutions with charge @xmath47 ( @xmath76 ) that all have the same temperature within the range @xmath77 , where here @xmath78 refers to the minimum of @xmath79 for the @xmath47 black hole .",
    "the temperature of black holes with @xmath47 as a function of @xmath66 is qualitatively similar to that of the gr ( @xmath74 ) solutions , although one always finds the relation @xmath80 as said , in this paper we will only consider the case @xmath48 , because @xmath81 presents pathologies .    for negative values of @xmath36 ,",
    "other interesting phenomena appear .",
    "for example , one of the new features that solution ( [ g1])-([g2 ] ) exhibits for @xmath82 is the existence of an inner horizon at @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , there exists a precise value of mass relative to the coupling constant , @xmath84 , such that the solution is extremal , in the sense that horizons @xmath85 and @xmath66 coincide in that case .",
    "@xmath84 corresponds to the minimal value of the parameter @xmath35 for which the solution exhibits a horizon . in this case",
    ", the double root of metric function @xmath86 occurs at @xmath87 , with @xmath35 obeying the cubic equation@xmath88 this determines the value of @xmath84 .",
    "the extremal radius @xmath89 also obeys the quintic equation@xmath90 and , then , it immediately follows from ( [ t ] ) that , as probably expected , the temperature of the extremal solution vanishes , @xmath91 .",
    "the near horizon geometry of the extremal solution is the product space ads@xmath92 with a curvature given by @xmath93 .",
    "the fact that in this theory the sufficiently small hairy black holes have positive specific heat suggests that phase transition may take place at short distances .",
    "in fact , we will show that a rich phase diagram emerges , with different geometries ( with different values of @xmath36 ) dominating in different ranges of temperature . to investigate the phase transition in the semiclassical approximation , we resort to the euclidean path integral approach : in asymptotically ads space , the problem",
    "can be thought of as one at finite volume and , therefore , since one is concerned with a question at finite temperature , the appropriate thermodynamical quantity to look at is helmholtz free energy @xmath94 , @xcite . in the semiclassical approximation , the free energy is given in terms of @xmath95 by the relation @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the inverse of the hawking temperature and , as usual , is given by the period of the compactified euclidean time @xmath98 required for the real euclidean section of the geometry not to develope a conical deficit at @xmath99 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the computation of @xmath94 ( see ( [ bardo ] ) below ) involves a regularization of the infrared divergence , and this is achieved by background substraction in the standard way , i.e. by substracting the euclidean action evaluated on the thermal ads@xmath0 configuration . in particular",
    ", this amounts to match the ( red - shifted ) period @xmath100 at fixed radius @xmath101 and then take the limit @xmath102    the mass can also be obtained from the euclidean action as follows@xmath103 this yields@xmath104 which reproduces the result obtained by the hamiltonian formalism if setting @xmath59 in ( [ m1 ] ) .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that the mass has a minimum when @xmath105 this occurs for the value of @xmath55 of the extremal solution , namely @xmath106 , cf .",
    "( [ w ] ) .",
    "solutions with @xmath107 exhibit no event horizon and , therefore , correspond to naked curvature singularities .",
    "this could have suggested to set the reference background in ( [ m1 ] ) to be that with @xmath108 for not to have in the spectrum positive energy states that represent naked singularities .",
    "this would have been similar to what happens , for instance , in the case of the three - dimensional black hole @xcite , where the value of the mass parameter that corresponds to ads@xmath109 space does not coincide with the minimum value of the black hole mass . however , the euclidean action computation ( [ me ] ) yields the result ( [ m2 ] ) with @xmath59 .",
    "black hole entropy is also obtained from the euclidean action through the relation@xmath110 this yields @xmath111 with @xmath112 given by @xmath113    expression ( [ s ] ) coincides with the result obtained by using the wald entropy formula @xcite .",
    "recalling that the volume of the @xmath30-sphere is @xmath31 one verifies that , up to the additive constant @xmath112 , entropy ( [ s ] ) satisfies the area law ; namely @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "additive constants in the area law are usual features in theories with higher - curvature couplings ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) , and conformal invariance of our model allows no other dependence . understanding the presence of @xmath112 in ( [ s ] ) and its implicances would be actually desirable .",
    "this probably demands a better understanding of the role of boundary terms in this context .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that the entropy obtained in ( [ se])-([s ] ) , together with ( [ t ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) , fullfil the first law of black hole thermodynamics ; namely , one verifies @xmath116    let us now study the free energy and the phase transitions between different configurations at fixed temperature .",
    "then , one can compute the free energy @xmath117 .",
    "this can be written as@xmath118    in the case @xmath74 ( i.e. @xmath63 ) this result reduces to that of gr , namely @xmath119 , which in particular manifestly exhibits the hawking - page transition @xcite at @xmath120 . at large @xmath66 ,",
    "the difference between the free energy of hairy ( @xmath121 ) black holes and the free energy of the schwarzschild - ads@xmath0 ( @xmath74 ) black holes goes like @xmath122 this implies that , for sufficiently large temperature , the hairy black holes with @xmath123 are thermodynamically favored .    deciding which configuration dominates in each range of temperatures",
    "amounts to compute the difference of the corresponding free energies .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that the comparison between the free energies of different solutions has to be performed at fixed temperature @xmath79 , which means to compare black holes configurations that do not necessarily have the same radius @xmath66 .",
    "this is because the temperature as a function of the radius depends also on the parameter @xmath36 , so that two black holes with the three different values that @xmath36 may take ( namely @xmath124 ) and that possess the same temperature necessarily have different radii ( cf .",
    "( [ jerarquia ] ) ) .     for different values of @xmath36 ]    the analysis of the main thermodynamical properties and the phase transitions are summarized in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "figure 1  shows the temperature ( @xmath79 )  as a function of the ( external ) horizon radius ( @xmath66 ) for different values of @xmath36 .",
    "the temperature curve of hairy black holes with @xmath126 exhibits a local maximum ( @xmath127 ) . besides , black holes with @xmath71 , unlike those with @xmath74 , may have arbitrarily low temperature .",
    "so , there is a minimum value of temperature , @xmath128 , for which black holes with @xmath74 and with @xmath71 may have the same free energy . evaluating free energy ( [ bardo ] ) for a black hole with @xmath71 at temperature @xmath128 ,",
    "one finds a positive value regardless the absolute value of @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that thermal ads@xmath0 is the configuration that dominates at such temperature . on the other hand , at very large temperature",
    ", it follows from ( [ follows ] ) that -for negative values of @xmath129- the configuration with minimum free energy corresponds to the @xmath71 black hole .",
    "therefore , one concludes from this that phase transition takes place at certain temperature @xmath130 .",
    "this is summarized in figure 2 , which shows the free energy ( @xmath94 )  as a function of temperature ( @xmath79 ) for the three different values of @xmath131 . at large @xmath79 the black holes with @xmath71",
    "are thermodynamically favored , having the lowest free energy . below certain critical temperature , the thermal ads@xmath0 configuration ( @xmath132 )",
    "is the dominant one .",
    "the segment connecting points a and b corresponds to the small black holes  with positive specific heat .",
    "the curve connecting points b and c corresponds to black holes solutions with @xmath71 having temperatures between the local minimum and local maximum of @xmath79 .",
    "this analysis manifestly shows that phase transition takes place at high temperature , being the hairy black holes with negative _ charge _ @xmath36 those that are favored .    finally , for completeness , we also consider a case with @xmath133 which is depicted in figure 3 and",
    "where the hairless case ( @xmath74 ) has been included for reference .",
    "the curve on the left represents the black holes with @xmath134 .",
    "these black holes have positive specific heat and they are the dominant configuration under tunnelling",

    "( the hairless solution @xmath74 has been included for reference ) . ]",
    "figure 4 , on the other hand , shows the temperature as a function of the mass ( @xmath55 ) for different values of @xmath36 -corresponding to different choices of the coupling constants in the matter lagrangian- .",
