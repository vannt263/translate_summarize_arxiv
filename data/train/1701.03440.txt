    "the kinematics and dynamics of stellar systems composed of a few massive stars situated at comparable distances from each other have been little studied .",
    "the prototype of such systems is , of course , the orion trapezium , and it is surprising that there are still many observational uncertainties associated with this famous and otherwise well studied system .",
    "so , for instance , very few studies on dynamical stability of trapezium - type systems are found in the literature ( allen & poveda 1974a , 1974b , pflamm - altenburg & kroupa 2006 ) .",
    "allen & poveda ( 1974a ) reported the results of numerical integrations of 30 systems , with trapezium - like initial positions and virialized velocities .",
    "the main conclusion was that after 30 crossing times ( about 1 million years ) only 30% of the systems survived as trapezia .",
    "allen & poveda ( 1974b ) found that the probability of survival of a trapezium after 5,000 years was 14% .",
    "after @xmath2 years only about 4% of the trapezia survived as such .",
    "pflamm - altenburg & kroupa ( 2006 ) concluded that the orion trapezium was likely to be an ob star core in its final stages of decay .",
    "note that the results of those two studies are not directly comparable , since both used different criteria to define trapezium - type systems and their dynamical stability , as well as different initial configurations , and different values for the stellar masses . neither attempted to use actual observed values of positions , velocities and masses of the orion trapezium components as initial conditions , due to the unavailability of such data .",
    "it is clear that the region near the orion trapezium has been very active dynamically .",
    "studies of the radio sources embedded in the bn - kl region ( rodrguez et al .",
    "2005 , gmez et al .",
    "2008 ) showed that three of these radio sources move away from a common point where they converged about 500 years ago .",
    "costero et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , observing only the radial velocity , found that component e of the orion trapezium is escaping from it , probably as a result of dynamical interactions within the system .",
    "the orion trapezium is composed of four very bright stars in a trapezoidal configuration , and several fainter ones .",
    "the brightest star ( @xmath3 ori c ) is responsible for the excitation of the orion nebula .",
    "it has an apparent magnitude @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath3 ori a , with a magnitude @xmath5 , is an eclipsing binary .",
    "@xmath3 ori b , with a magnitude @xmath6 , is also known as bm ori , and it is really a mini - cluster .",
    "ori d has a magnitude @xmath5 .",
    "the spectral types of the four brighter stars range from o to early b. @xmath3 ori e is an escaping spectroscopic binary .",
    "another star , @xmath3 ori f has some times been considered as belonging to the trapezium , but it is probably a foreground star .",
    "observationally , the orion trapezium still presents many challenges .",
    "so , for instance , the radial velocities of its main components are poorly known , probably as a consequence of the prevalence of multiplicity among them .",
    "specifically , component a is known to be an interferometric binary , a1+a3 , while a1 itself is a spectroscopic binary with a separation of about 1 au .",
    "hence , a is a triple system ( bossi et al .",
    "1989 , close et al .",
    "component b is really a mini - cluster , composed by at least 5 stars in close proximity ( close et al .",
    "2013 ) . the brightest component ,",
    "star c is known to be at least a double , and probably attended by a third companion ( lehmann et al .",
    "component d is a spectroscopic binary ( plaskett & pearce 1931 ) . as mentioned before , component e is a spectroscopic binary , with a systemic velocity sufficiently large to be escaping from the trapezium ( costero et al .",
    "2008 ) .    with regard to the tangential motions , a recent study ( close et al .",
    "2013 ) described in detail the internal motions of the mini - cluster @xmath3 ori b. using these data and the best available radial velocities , allen et al .",
    "( 2015 ) conducted a numerical exploration of the dynamical evolution of this mini - cluster , arriving at the conclusion that its age is probably less than 30,000 years .",
    "recently , fairly reliable tangential motions for @xmath3 ori itself have become available ( olivares et al . 2013 ) .",
    "they were obtained by a combination of historical data and new measurements based on hubble space telescope images . with these new data",
    ", it seems worthwhile to conduct a numerical exploration of the dynamical evolution of ensembles of systems resembling the best currently available observational data of the orion trapezium itself , similar to that we performed for the minicluster or sub - trapezium @xmath3 ori b.    we discuss in section 2 the data for the transverse velocities and their uncertainties .",
    "section 3 is devoted to an examination of the available radial velocities and of the masses of the main trapezium members .",
    "section 4 describes the initial conditions and the numerical integrations performed to model the dynamical evolution of ensembles of orion trapezium - like systems .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section 5 .",
    "section 6 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "olivares et al . ( 2013 ) obtained the relative motions of components a to f of the orion trapezium ( ot ) using the diffracto - astrometry technique .",
    "they measured the evolution in time of the relative positions of the ot components .",
    "this was achieved by analyzing 44 high quality public - archive images of the hubble space telescope wide field planetary camera 2 .",
    "the images were taken over a span of 12 years ( 19952007 ) . due to the fact that the ot is the trapezium - type system best studied in the astronomical literature",
    ", they also used the historical compilation of ot data contained in the washington double star catalog ( wds ) maintained by mason et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , thus extending their analysis time - base to about 200 years .",
    "for every pair of components they found the relative rate of separation as well as the temporal rate of change of their position angles",
    ". the relative rate of separation is expressed on the axes of an orthogonal coordinate system , where the positive @xmath7 direction corresponds to the west direction , while the positive @xmath8 direction corresponds to the north . in table",
    "[ tab : otposrelc ] we show the @xmath7 and @xmath8 positions of the main components a to e in a reference frame centered on the c component .",
    "note that the errors of the respective positions are of the order of milliarcseconds .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : observables65 ]              in the course of the dynamical evolution many stars were ejected from the original trapezia .",
    "figure [ fig : histveltodasmc45 ] displays the distribution of velocities for all ejected stars for @xmath9 it is clear from the figure that all ejected stars have relatively low velocities , under 8  km  s^-1^. a star was considered to be an ejected escaper when its energy with respect to the center of mass of the system was positive , provided that it did not form a close pair with another star . in all cases considered these escapers left the system permanently .",
    "the velocity distribution of the ejected stars for the ensemble with @xmath10 is shown in figure [ fig : histveltodasmc65 ] .",
    "again , the escapers have relatively low velocities .",
    "it is clear that the encounters occurring during the evolution of the systems are relatively soft , and do not give rise to high velocity escapers , or runaways .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation we found for the minicluster @xmath3 ori b , where close encounters did occur , and whose dynamical evolution did produce a few high velocity escapers .",
    "as the simulated systems reach larger ages , their dynamical evolution produces an increasing number of bound binaries .",
    "in fact , the most frequent end result of the simulations is a sole binary , which absorbs the binding energy of the initial system , compensating the positive energy carried away by the escapers .",
    "the distribution of major semiaxes of the resulting binaries is shown in figures [ fig : histatodasmc45 ] and [ fig : histatodasmc65 ] , for values of the mass of component c of 45 and 65 @xmath11 , respectively , and for increasing values of the age ( in units of the crossing time ) .",
    "the distributions show sharp maxima at @xmath12 au and @xmath13 au respectively .",
    "these maxima roughly correspond to the situation where the binding energy of the original trapezium is absorbed by one binary .",
    "the dissolution of systems resembling the orion trapezium thus produces mostly wide binaries , and may be partly responsible for populating the field with such systems .",
    "the distribution of eccentricities is shown in figures [ fig : histetodasmc45 ] and [ fig : histetodasmc65 ] , again for values of the mass of component c of 45 and 65 @xmath11 , respectively , and for increasing values of the age ( in units of the crossing time ) .",
    "the average value of the eccentricities after 100 crossing times is equal to 0.77 for the cases with @xmath14 , and 0.71 for those with @xmath15 , close to , but slightly larger than , the expected value for a group of binaries whose distribution in phase space depends only on their energy ( ambartsumian , 1937 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : histetodasmc45 ] and [ fig : histetodasmc65 ] also show that the eccentricity distribution follows approximately the relation @xmath16d@xmath17d@xmath18 ( heggie , 1975 ) , that is , it is roughly thermal .",
    "figure  [ fig : logavse ] displays the major semiaxes as a function of the eccentricities for a total of @xmath19 and @xmath20 binaries formed during the integrations at @xmath21 for both values of @xmath22 .",
    "this figure resembles the observational result of raghavan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for the region of long period @xmath23 days ) . very few binaries appear to have eccentricities @xmath24 at all values of the major semiaxis . for larger values of @xmath18 ,",
    "the points seem to be randomly scattered in the vertical direction of the plot but still in a limited region of all possible binary major semiaxes .             and dots to the case with @xmath10 .",
    "very few binaries with eccentricities smaller than 0.3 are present , an expected result for binaries formed via dynamical interactions .",
    "large eccentricities are present predominantly at large values of the semiaxes .",
    "the majority of semiaxes cluster around 2,000 au.,width=377,height=264 ]",
    "our numerical exploration of ensembles of systems mimicking the dynamical evolution of the orion trapezium has produced some remarkable results .",
    "we can summarize them as follows .",
    "* star e nearly always escapes right at the beginning of the numerical integrations . in 300 runs conducted",
    ", we found only one exception , where star e became bound for a short period but escaped soon afterwards . * including star e all systems turned out to have a small positive virial value . excluding star e ,",
    "the virial value was approximately zero .",
    "* in the time - reversal runs , star e was captured in about 25 % of the cases in less than 2,000 years .",
    "this suggests that star e is probably a recently ejected member of the orion trapezium . *",
    "using the best available value for the mass of component c , only 25% of the simulated systems survived as trapezia after 10,000 years , but only 5% resembled the original trapezium configuration .",
    "therefore , the mean lifetime would be much less than 10,000 years , a value that seems implausibly short for the orion trapezium . * with a larger mass for the c component the mean dynamical lifetime of the systems turned out to be between 10,000 and 50,000 years .",
    "this value is compatible with the dynamical age we estimated for the minicluster @xmath3 ori b ( about 30,000 years ) .",
    "it is also compatible with the age of the  huygens region \" of the orion nebula , estimated to be 15,000 years ( odell et al .",
    "we think therefore that the value of 45 @xmath11 for the mass of component c is an underestimate . *",
    "the end result of the dynamical evolution after 100 crossing times was usually a tight binary , sometimes a hierarchical triple system . *",
    "the properties of the binaries formed during the integrations are comparable with observational values .",
    "the eccentricity distribution of the binaries formed in the numerical simulations is approximately thermal .",
    "the dissolution of systems closely mimicking the orion trapezium produces mostly wide binaries and could be partly responsible for populating the field with such massive systems .",
    "the distribution of the major semiaxes has a maximum roughly corresponding to the binding energy of the initial systems . *",
    "the period - eccentricity distribution closely resembles the observational data .",
    "very few binaries with @xmath24 are produced for all values of @xmath25 .",
    "* most of the ejected stars have velocities close to the escape velocity .",
    "no runaway stars were produced in the simulations .",
    "this means that it is highly unlikely for systems resembling the orion trapezium as a whole to be able to generate runaway stars , as has sometimes been claimed .",
    "we recall that we did find some runaways in our previous study of the dynamical future of the minicluster @xmath3 ori b ( allen et al . , 2015 ) .",
    "the evolution of this mini - cluster is obviously more violent than that of an entire trapezium .    a more complete numerical exploration of the possible outcomes of the dynamical evolution of systems mimicking the orion trapezium should include a much larger number of numerical realizations .",
    "however , we believe that we have presented a fair sampling of possible initial conditions obtained from the best currently available observational data .",
    "we disregarded the pa rates of change because of their low accuracy .",
    "this implies that we are underestimating the tangential velocities , which in turn means that the dynamical lifetimes should be somewhat shorter .",
    "we tried to be as explicit as possible about the uncertainties in the observational data and about the assumptions implicit in their derivation .",
    "it is probably not worthwhile to conduct numerical experiments with more realizations until more reliable values for the tangential and radial velocities as well as for the masses of the components become available .",
    "an interesting question is whether the widely accepted notion that the orion trapezium is a bound system is valid , especially in view of the rather short lifetimes we find , and of the escaping component e. at least two arguments support its being a bound system .",
    "first , the probability of finding four bright stars within a radius of @xmath26 arcseconds is very low .",
    "second , the relative motions of the main components in the plane of the sky are very small , also implying a bound system . however , if a better knowledge of the radial velocities should show widely discrepant values , the question would have to be re - examined .    3.0 cm",
