    "in a pioneering paper  @xcite , shannon established the achievability of perfectly secure communication in the presence of an eavesdropper with unbounded computational complexity . however , the necessary condition for perfect secrecy , i.e. , that the entropy of the private key is at least as large as that of the message , appears to be prohibitive for most practical applications . in  @xcite , wyner revisited the problem and proved the achievability of a positive secrecy rate over a degraded discrete memoryless channel , via a _ key - less _ secrecy approach , by relaxing the _ noiseless _ assumption and the strict notion of perfect secrecy employed in  @xcite .",
    "wyner s results were later extended to the gaussian and broadcast channels in  @xcite  and  @xcite , respectively . in  @xcite ,",
    "maurer showed how to exploit the presence of a _",
    "public discussion _ channel to achieve positive secrecy over the one way wiretap channel even when the eavesdropper channel is less noisy than the legitimate one . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered a more practical feedback scenario where the noiseless public channel is replaced by _",
    "receiver feedback _ over the same noisy channel . under this assumption",
    ", it was shown that the perfect secrecy capacity is equal to the capacity of the main channel in the absence of the eavesdropper for full - duplex modulo - additive discrete memoryless channels .",
    "more interestingly ,  @xcite established the achievability of positive secrecy rates , even under the half - duplex constraint where each feedback symbol introduces an erasure event in the main channel .",
    "our work generalizes this line of work by investigating the fundamental limits of the two - way wiretap channel , where alice and bob wish to exchange secure messages in the presence of a passive eavesdropper eve .",
    "it is easy to see that the one way channel with feedback considered in  @xcite is a special case of this model . using the cooperative channel prefixing and binning technique proposed in  @xcite , along with an innovative approach for key sharing between alice and bob , we first derive an inner bound on the secrecy capacity region of the full - duplex discrete memoryless two - way wiretap channel . by specializing our results to the additive modulo-@xmath0 and gaussian channel , our region",
    "is shown to be strictly larger than those reported recently in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the gain can be attributed to the fact that we allow both nodes to simultaneously send secure messages when the channel conditions are favorable .",
    "we then proceed to the half - duplex setting where each node can only transmit or receive on the same degree of freedom . here",
    ", we introduce the concept of _ randomized scheduling for secrecy _ , whereby alice and bob send their symbols at random time instants to maximally confuse eve at the expense of introducing * collisions and erasure events * in the main channel .",
    "remarkably , this approach is shown to result in significant gains in the achievable secure sum rate , as compared with the traditional deterministic scheduling approach . in the gaussian scenario ,",
    "we show that the ambiguity at eve can be further enhanced by randomizing the transmit power levels .    inspired by our information theoretic foundation",
    ", we develop an ieee @xmath1 testbed to estimate the ambiguity at the eavesdropper in near field wireless sensor networks where the distance between the legitimate nodes is significantly smaller than that to the potential eavesdropper .",
    "a representative scenario corresponds to body area networks ( ban ) which are being considered for a variety of health care applications . here",
    ", the sensor nodes are mounted on the body , and hence , any potential eavesdropper is expected to be at a significantly larger distance from each legitimate node . clearly , ensuring the confidentiality of the messages exchanged between sensors is an important design consideration in this application . assuming an eavesdropper equipped with an energy classifier , analytical and experimental results that quantify the achievable secrecy sum rate under a two dimensional path loss model are derived .",
    "however , it is worth noting that we do not address the issue of implementing the classical wiretap code  @xcite in this work",
    ". overall , these results establish the gain offered by the two - way randomization concept and establish the feasibility of our approach in realistic scenarios .",
    "it is worth noting that similar settings to the one considered in this work , exist in the literature . in particular",
    ", the authors in  @xcite consider a binary erasure block - fading channel where the nodes are placed according to a similar geometric model to that in section  [ experimental ] , and provide analytical and experimental results for the secrecy outage probabilities for frames of different sizes ,  @xcite considers an extension of the two - way wiretap channel where the untrusted eavesdropper may be used to relay messages between the two users .",
    "also ,  @xcite considers the two - way wiretap channel with a _",
    "strong secrecy _ constraint , where the mutual information leakage to the eavesdropper , rather than the leakage rate ( defined in section  [ full_duplex ] ) is required to vanish in the limit of the number of channel uses .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ full_duplex ]",
    ", we develop an achievable secrecy rate region for the full - duplex discrete memoryless two - way wiretap channel , and specialize the result to the additive modulo-@xmath0 and gaussian channel .",
    "section  [ half_duplex ] is devoted to the half - duplex scenario where the concept of randomized scheduling is introduced .",
    "our practical setting , using the tinyos - enabled sensor boards , is described in section  [ experimental ] .",
    "the analytical and experimental results of this section establish the feasibility of our approach in near field wireless sensor network applications . finally , we offer some concluding remarks in section  [ conclusion ] . to enhance the flow of the paper ,",
    "the detailed proofs are collected in the appendices .",
    "in the full - duplex scenario , each of the two legitimate terminals is equipped with a transmitter and a receiver that can operate simultaneously on the same degree of freedom .",
    "the two users intend to _ exchange _ messages in the presence of a ( passive ) eavesdropper .",

    "the channel is given by @xmath37 and is memoryless in the following sense .",

    "@xmath302 were found to be very close to those of a classifier that does not erase any received symbols , i.e. , transmission scenarios corresponding to concurrent transmissions are not considered .",
    "we implemented our experiments on tinyos @xcite using telosb motes @xcite , which have a built - in cc2420 radio module @xcite .",

    "eve then transfers the rssi readings from the memory buffer to the gateway node which will forward them to the pc in an _ rssi - msg_. for each cycle , the java program stores the received rssi readings for further processing by the energy classifier ( implemented in matlab ) . when transmitting data messages ( _ data - msg _ ) from alice or bob , each node constructs a random payload of 100 bytes using the randommlcg component of tinyos , which uses the park - miller minimum standard generator .",

    "we also had to remove the csma - ca mechanism from the cc2420 driver in order to allow both alice and bob to transmit concurrently .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the orchestrator was used to overcome the synchronization challenge in our experimental set - up . in practical implementations , bob ( or alice ) could start jamming the channel upon receiving the start of frame delimiter ( sfd ) .    in our implementation of the energy classifier",
    ", the discrete nature of the transmit power levels is taken into consideration .",
    "first , the eavesdropper was given the advantage of having the classifier trained on a set of readings taken by running the experiment in the same environment and at the same node locations as those for which the classifier would be later used . in the training phase ,",

    "it then finds the mean and variance of the measured rssi values for each transmitted power level for alice and bob when each of them sends alone in a cycle .",

    "the length of a cycle is the duration of a single symbol , and hence , in our setup the classifier bases its decision on a single rssi reading . in evaluating the classifier performance , we use the transmission scenario indicating the actual status of the transmitters in each cycle and compare them with the classification results to obtain the probability of each possible misclassification event .",
    "we also assume that , in case of concurrent transmission , eve can correctly decode the symbol received with the higher signal power , as suggested in  @xcite .",

    "more specifically , we observe that the maximum secrecy rates for the two - way randomized scheduling scheme in our experimental results is slightly lower than those calculated numerically .",
    "the reason is eve s enhanced ability to distinguish between the two sources of transmission due to the discrete nature of the selected transmit power values .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental results establish the ability of our two - way randomized scheduling and power allocation scheme to achieve perfect secrecy in practical near field communication scenarios where the distance between eve and legitimate nodes will be larger than the inter - node distance , * even if eve is equipped with a very large receive antenna*.",
