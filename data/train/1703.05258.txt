    "a successful method to improve the temporal resolution in sub - relativistic pump - probe ultrafast electron diffraction ( ued ) experiments is the use of a resonant radio frequency ( rf ) cavity in tm@xmath1 mode@xcite to compress electron pulses to the @xmath0fs range . in this way",
    "single - shot ued has been demonstrated with @xmath2  fs electron bunches@xcite . to achieve this",
    "the phase of the oscillating electro - magnetic field is synchronized@xcite to both the pump and photoemission laser .",
    "however , rf phase instabilities in the synchronization system lead to variations in the arrival time of the electron bunches , thus limiting the temporal resolution of ued experiments to a few @xmath0fs@xcite .",
    "in addition , rf amplitude instabilities may lead to further degradation of the temporal resolution@xcite .",
    "this paper theoretically describes how to eliminate the rf phase jitter using two or three tm@xmath1 cavities , depending on the velocity chirp of the incoming electron beam .",
    "if powered by the same rf source and with a proper choice of rf field strengths , phases and distances between the cavities , the combined phase jitter is cancelled at the compression point .",
    "the effect of amplitude instabilities can be minimized by operating the compression cavity at a rf phase for optimal ( de)compression . in this way",
    "the temporal resolution can be improved substantially .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first ( sec .",
    "[ theorysect ] ) we will introduce the concept of using a compression cavity as a longitudinal lens and derive its corresponding focal length . hereafter",
    "[ theorysect]a ) we will show how rf phase and amplitude fluctuations result in arrival time jitter and how this is connected to the focal length of the longitudinal lens .",
    "next ( sec .",
    "[ theorysect]b , c ) we show how to use two or three cavities to effectively cancel the arrival time jitter at the compression point . hereafter ( sec .  [ sectgpt ] ) we will present detailed charged particle tracking simulation results that perfectly agree with the derived analytical theory . we thus show that it is possible to create a longitudinal focus that is inherently insensitive to _ both _ phase _ and _ amplitude fluctuations of the rf field in the compression cavities . finally ( sec .  [ seclimit ] )",
    "we discuss the limitations .",
    "the principle of using resonant rf cavities as longitudinal lenses for sub - relativistic ued is an established technique which is described in ref .",
    "the on - axis oscillating electric field inside the rf cavity is given by @xmath3 with @xmath4 the on - axis longitudinal electric field amplitude , @xmath5 the angular frequency and @xmath6 the rf phase .",
    "the change in longitudinal momentum @xmath7 an electron acquires by traveling trough an rf cavity is given by@xcite    @xmath8    with @xmath9 the electron charge , @xmath10 the effective cavity length , @xmath11 the electric field strength at the center of the cavity , @xmath12 the average speed of the electron bunch and @xmath13 the longitudinal electron coordinate with respect to the center of the bunch ; @xmath6 is chosen as the rf phase at the moment the center of the electron bunch passes trough the center of the cavity . the longitudinal focal length @xmath14 of a such a cavity is given by@xcite    @xmath15    with @xmath16 the electron mass and @xmath17 the lorentz factor with @xmath18 .",
    "equation  [ dpzeq ] shows that the average momentum change @xmath7 of the electron pulse passing through the cavity is zero if the center of the bunch passes through the center of the cavity when the rf electric field goes through zero , i.e. @xmath19 . operating the cavity at a phase of @xmath20 will result in bunch compression : the electrons in the front part of the bunch will be decelerated while the electrons in the back will be accelerated .",
    "operating the cavity at @xmath21 will result in decompression , the electrons in the front part are accelerated and the ones in the back are decelerated .",
    "rf phase variations @xmath22 and electric field amplitude fluctuations @xmath23 will result in a net acceleration or deceleration of the electron bunch depending on the sign of @xmath22 , @xmath24 and the focal length of the lens .",
    "this leads to arrival time fluctuations @xmath25 at a distance @xmath26 from the cavity@xcite , given by    @xmath27    equation  ( [ rfjitcond ] ) shows that the arrival time depends on the focal length of the lens , so choosing two lenses with opposite focal lengths will allow us to cancel the arrival time fluctuations due to _ both _ rf phase _ and _ amplitude fluctuations at some point behind the two cavities . for optimal ( de-)compression",
    ", i.e. @xmath19 , the latter equation reduces to    @xmath28    showing that the arrival time fluctuations due to amplitude fluctuations @xmath24 are a second order effect .",
    "we can illustrate this with a numerical example : state - of - the - art synchronization by an rf phase locked loop system has a typical residual phase rf phase jitter @xmath29mrad@xcite . assuming a typical angular frequency @xmath30ghz and @xmath31 we find @xmath32fs .",
    "solid state rf amplifiers are commercially available with a rf amplitude stability of @xmath33 , which results in an electric field amplitude stability of @xmath34 and thus to additional arrival time jitter on the order of @xmath35 . clearly",
    "the amplitude contribution to the arrival time jitter is negligible , owing to it being a second order effect .",
    "the validity of eq .",
    "[ dtphaseenergy ] is confirmed by charged particle simulations which will be presented in section  [ sectgpt ] .",
    "rf amplitude fluctuations also causes the longitudinal focus to shift position , thus resulting in bunch length fluctuations at the nominal ( @xmath36 ) position of the waist .",
    "the courant - snyder @xmath37 parameter@xcite in the longitudinal waist is given by    @xmath38    with @xmath39 the pulse length at the longitudinal waist and @xmath40 the normalized longitudinal emittance .",
    "the courant - snyder parameter @xmath41 is equivalent to the raighley length in optics .",
    "we want @xmath41 to be much larger than the shift of the focal position to ensure that the pulse length at the nominal focus is not affected by rf amplitude instabilities .",
    "this means that the shift in focal position should be much smaller than @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 , which is equivalent to    @xmath43    for @xmath0kev electrons , @xmath44 m , @xmath45fs and a normalized root - mean - squared ( rms ) longitudinal emittance @xmath46fs@xmath47ev this results in the condition @xmath48 , which is easily achievable .",
    "we will now first derive how to longitudinally compress an electron pulse by using a two lens focussing system , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lenssystem ] .",
    "we will use geometrical optics to describe the longitudinal focussing system , i.e. the paraxial beam approximation and thin and weak - lens approximations@xcite .",
    "the first lens is a negative lens with focal length @xmath49 .",
    "this lens stretches the electron bunch ; the second lens is a positive lens with a focal length @xmath50 .",
    "this lens is used to compress the electron bunch , as illustrated in fig  [ lenssystem ] .",
    "the distance between the lenses is given by @xmath51 .",
    "the longitudinal divergence of the incoming electron beam is parameterized by the length @xmath52 , which is the distance of the focal point with respect to the position of the first lens if @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 corresponds to a converging beam which is longitudinally focused a distance @xmath52 behind the first cavity , as is schematically indicated in fig .",
    "[ lenssystem ] .",
    "@xmath55 represents an diverging electron beam which originates from a beam waist a distance @xmath52 before the first lens .",
    ", the second lens is a positive lens with a focal length @xmath50 .",
    "the combination of the two lenses compresses the beam at a distance @xmath56 behind the second lens.,width=604 ]    the distance @xmath56 with respect to the second lens ( see fig .",
    "[ lenssystem ] ) , of this two - lens system is given by    @xmath57    with @xmath58 , @xmath49 and @xmath24 the electric field amplitude jitter which modulates the focal length of the lens .",
    "in the case that the incoming beam is parallel the latter equation reduces to    @xmath59    in the case that the first lens collimates the incoming converging beam ( @xmath60 ) the position of the focal point becomes    @xmath61      we assume that both cavities have the exact same phase and amplitude variations since they are driven by the same rf amplified signal . from eq .",
    "[ dtphaseenergy ] it then follows that for optimal ( de)compression the arrival time jitter of the electron pulse at the second cavity ( lens 2 ) due to the first cavity ( lens 1 ) is given by    @xmath62    similarly , the arrival time jitter at a distance @xmath63 behind the second cavity ( lens 2 ) due to the first cavity ( lens 1 ) is given by    @xmath64    the arrival time jitter at a distance @xmath63 behind the second cavity ( lens 2 ) due to the second cavity is given by    @xmath65    there will be no arrival time jitter at a distance @xmath63 behind the second cavity ( lens 2 ) when @xmath66 which shows that _ both _ phase @xmath22 _ and _ amplitude @xmath24 variations cancel in first order .",
    "the point where there is no jitter is given by    @xmath67    with @xmath68 , @xmath49 and @xmath69 since @xmath70 .    to improve the temporal resolution of ued experiments",
    "the no - jitter point @xmath63 has to overlap with the longitudinal focal point @xmath56 .",
    "these points overlap when the following equation holds :    @xmath71    with @xmath72 since eq.([ljitter ] ) requires @xmath69 .",
    "the point where the pulse length is independent of rf phase fluctuations for all electrons inside a bunch is then given by    @xmath73    this means that overlapping the focal point and the no - jitter point is only possible for beams with negative energy chirp ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this means that in order to cancel the phase jitter in an rf focussing system with two cavities we need an already focussing electron beam .",
    "this is the case for an electron beam which is extracted from a longitudinally extended source such as a laser cooled gas@xcite .",
    "an electron beam extracted from a photo - emission gun can be negatively chirped using magnetic compression schemes .",
    "an rf photo - gun operated at the right phase can also produce longitudinally converging bunches .",
    "rf amplitude variations lead to arrival time variations @xmath75 at the position of the jitter correction point given by    @xmath76    here we see that rf amplitude fluctuations in both rf compression cavities result in only small deviations in arrival time at the focus due to the second order nature of the contribution . in addition ,",
    "amplitude fluctuations lead to the shifts of the focal position given by    @xmath77    as shown in section  [ theorysect ] , @xmath78 which results in the following condition    @xmath79    which is easily achievable in practice .      in the previous section",
    "we have shown that it is possible to create a jitter free focus using a set of two rf cavities if the incoming beam is longitudinally _",

    "space - charge effects have not been taken into account .",
