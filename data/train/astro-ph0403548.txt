    "star formation ( sf ) leads to x - ray emission on various spatial and temporal scales , including emission from o stars , x - ray binaries , supernovae and their remnants ( snrs ) , and galactic - scale emission from diffuse hot gas , and compton scattering of fir & cmb photons by sn - accelerated electrons .",
    "integrated spectra of actively sf galaxies may show all these components as well as emission from an active nucleus ( rephaeli et al .",
    "1991 , 1995 ) .",
    "persic & rephaeli ( 2002 ; hereafter , pr02 ) have quantitatively assessed the roles of the various x - ray emission mechanisms in sfgs .",
    "they have used an equilibrium stellar - population synthesis model of the galactic population of x - ray binaries to deduce birthrates for interacting binaries ; these , combined with estimates of the duration of the x - ray bright phase , have allowed pr02 to make realistic estimates of the relative ( galactic ) abundances of high - mass and low - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs and lmxbs , in which the optical companions are main - sequence stars with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "the abundance of snrs ( both type ii and ia ) was also consistently estimated . from the literature",
    "pr02 derived typical spectra for these source classes .",
    "the spectral properties and relative abundances of the various classes of stellar sources allowed pr02 to calculate the composite x - ray spectrum arising from a stellar population of galactic composition .",
    "in addition to such `` stellar '' components , pr02 considered two diffuse , non - stellar contributions to a starburst ( sb ) x - ray spectrum .    _",
    "( i ) _ thermal emission from the regions of interaction between sn - powered outgoing galactic wind and denser ambient ism , mostly at energies @xmath41 kev , and thus of little concern to us here .    _",
    "( ii ) _ non - thermal emission due to compton scattering of the sn - accelerated relativistic radio - emitting electrons off the fir and cmb radiation fields . the high sn rate in a sb is bound to yield high relativistic electron densities since sn shocks are known to be primary sites of cosmic ray acceleration",
    "moreover , in a sb environment the mean fir energy density can be @xmath5 times higher than that of the cmb .",
    "compton scattering of a @xmath6 photon by a @xmath71 gev electron boosts the energy of the photon to @xmath710 kev .",
    "a high density of electrons in a sb would obviously be reflected also in enhanced radio emission .",
    "if the same electron population produces both the radio and hard x - ray emission , then both spectra are expected to have _ roughly _ the same power - law index ( rephaeli 1979 ; goldshmidt & rephaeli ( 1995 ) .",
    "compton x - ray emission gauges the current sfr since the electron compton - synchrotron lifetime is approximately @xmath410@xmath8 yr ( i.e. comparable to or shorter than a typical starburst duration ) .",
    "pr02 determined that the @xmath72 - 15 kev emission is dominated by lmxbs ; this is not surprising , given that the synthetic spectrum was calibrated by that of a normal , quietly star forming galaxy like ours .",
    "due to the long times between the formation and the onset of the x - ray phase ( the optical companion is a subsolar main - sequence star ) in lmxbs , their emission traces the higher , _ past _ galactic sfr , and not the lower , _ current _ sfr .",
    "thus in order to obtain an estimate of the current sfr , the spectral contribution of lmxbs should not be included . as noted by pr02 , at energies of approximately @xmath930 kev ( relevant for integral ) the sb spectrum",
    "is expected to be dominated by the compton component .",
    "recent observations of nearby galaxies  mostly with the _ chandra _ satellite  have revealed several x - ray point sources ( xps ) with 2 - 10 kev luminosities in the range @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 erg s@xmath1 ( hereafter dubbed very luminous sources : vlxs ) , and a few ultra - luminous sources ( ulxs ) , with @xmath12 erg s@xmath1 ( fabbiano & white 2003 ) .",
    "this is the range of bh masses that are thought to be attainable via ordinary stellar evolution .",
    "ulxs are called super - eddington sources. ] although their nature is not yet known , vlxs and ulxs are observed to be directly linked to current star formation activity ( e.g. , zezas et al .",
    "2002 ) , and when identified , the optical counterpart of ulxs are o stars ( liu et al .",
    "2002 ) , thus establishing a link between hmxbs and ulxs .",
    "the spectra of vlxs and ulxs are characterized both as power - law in the range of interest , with index @xmath13 and @xmath71.3 , respectively . ) onto the bh , while the other relevant parameters are constrained within a much smaller range ( e.g. , bh mass @xmath14 , efficiency @xmath15 ) .",
    "in fact , qualitatively speaking , the inverse correlation between luminosity and spectral index ( i.e. , flatter spectra for higher luminosities ) can be understood within the accretion model devised to explain the high x - ray luminosities of accretion - powered binary systems .",
    "the increase in luminosity is driven by an increase of @xmath16 , which in turn means a piling up of material around the emission region that leads to a higher compton optical depth , and hence to a lower value of @xmath17 i.e. a flatter spectrum .",
    "namely , if a source is embedded in a plasma cloud of optical depth @xmath18 and temperature @xmath19 , the spectral index @xmath17 of the high - frequency wing of the spectrum of the escaping radiation is @xmath20^{1/2 } ~-~ { 1 \\over 2}\\ ] ] ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ; shapiro et al .",

    "_ spectrum : _ power - law with ( photon ) index @xmath36 .",
    "the population of vlx and ulx sources in a galaxy is more abundant the more active is star formation in that galaxy . specifically , if the point source integral luminosity function ( xplf ) is described as @xmath37 ( which corresponds to a differential xplf of the type @xmath38 ) , based on a wealth of _ chandra _ observations it has been found that xplfs are less steep in sfgs than in normal spirals and ellipticals .",
    "( for example , the two most nearby sb galaxies , have @xmath39 ( m82 ) and @xmath40 ( ngc253 ) , while normal spirals have @xmath41 , and ellipticals have approximately @xmath42 ; see kilgard et al . 2002 . )",
    "so the integrated point source luminosity of sfgs is dominated by the highest-@xmath43 sources ( colbert et al .",
    "given an ( observed ) xplf , with the `` stellar '' component clearly sorted by luminosity , we can formally compute the integrated `` stellar '' spectrum according to @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the above spectral profiles , normalized to the energy band @xmath46-@xmath47 ( here , 2 - 100 kev ) , where the luminosity @xmath43 is defined . to this",
    "we add a diffuse compton component . to be specific , we choose a power - law index @xmath48 for the xplf ( i.e. roughly the average between the values observed for m82 and ngc253 ) , and a compton component which is 10% of the total flux at 10 kev .",
    "it is important to realize that our extrapolation of the observed spectra to 100 kev is just for the sake of computation .",
    "the resulting 2 - 100 kev spectrum is shown in fig.1 . in the synthetic spectrum a conspicuous knee , due to the break in the hmxb spectrum ,",
    "is immediately recognizable at 20 kev . if the ulx component , which turns out to lie very close to that of hmxbs for energies up to 20 kev , did turn out to have a similar break , then the knee in the synthetic spectrum would be sharper .",
    "an important related consideration is that the compton component will be swamped by the vlx and ulx components and thus practically undetectable by integral , unless both `` stellar '' components exhibit a spectral break similar to that of hmxbs .",
    "it can be argued that the hmxb spectral break is related to the magnetic field strength , @xmath49 , on the surface of the accreting neutron star : i ) statistically , the cutoff energy , @xmath50 , is correlated with the observed cyclotron resonance energy , @xmath51 , by @xmath52 : as the latter depends on @xmath49 so will the former , which will then provide a measure of @xmath49 ( a most helpful feature in those cases where a resonant scattering feature is not observed  white et al .",
    "1995 ) ; and ii ) physically , the spectral break could be due to radiative transfer effects in a strong magnetic field ( boldt et al .",
    "if the magnetic fields able to induce @xmath720 kev spectral breaks in vlx - ulx spectra have strengths comparable to those observed in hmxbs , , which can be produced via ordinary evolution ( i.e. through type ii sn events ) by progenitor stars with @xmath53 , the conservation of magnetic flux implies that for @xmath54 g at the surface of the progenitor star , it will be @xmath55 g at the schwarzschild radius , nearly irrespective of the bh mass .",
    "( see maeder & meynet 1989 for the relevant quantities of the stellar progenitors ) . these values are consistent with those deduced for the magnetized neutron stars which are members of hmxb systems ( see boldt et al .",
    "1976 ; white et al . 1995 ) . ]",
    "then a @xmath720 kev cutoff is expected also in the spectra of vlx and ulx sources .",
    "hence , the knee of the synthetic spectrum will turn out more marked and the compton component will possibly stand out more clearly ( at energies of approximately @xmath930 kev ) .",
    "integral measurements can possibly determine whether there is a break in vlx / ulx spectra .    on the other hand the compton emission , in order to be discernible even in the absence of vlx / ulx spectral breaks ,",
    "has to be stronger than assumed here . in our calculation",
    "we have assumed the compton flux to be 0.1 of the total at 10 kev ( which implies that it is @xmath710@xmath56 of the total 2 - 10 kev flux ) .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath72 higher than the upper limit set by griffith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on the compton flux fraction of m82 observed with _",
    "( see persic & rephaeli 2003 ) .",
    "it is possible that in sb galaxies high sn rates and dust temperatures enhance the compton component such that it dominates the spectrum at energies higher than @xmath730 kev ."
