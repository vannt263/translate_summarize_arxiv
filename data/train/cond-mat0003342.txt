    "the recent experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation(bec ) of alkali atoms in magnetic traps @xcite has generated much interest and activity in theoretical and experimental physics .",
    "an interesting , but less addressed , question is whether such a phase transition due to global coherence exists in two - dimensional(2d ) space . even though it has been known that 2d bec of a uniform(untrapped ) bose gas can not occur in 2d at a finite temperature since thermal fluctuations destabilize the condensate @xcite",
    ", it has been suggested that spatially - varying potentials which break the uniform distribution may create bec in 2d inhomogeneous systems @xcite . in the presence of trapping potential , the effect of thermal fluctuations",
    "are strongly quenched due to the different behavior exhibited by the density of states .",
    "at zero temperature , the 2d condensation can be described by the 2d gross - pitaevskii equation(gpe ) , a mean - field approximation for the macroscopic wave function of weakly interacting bosons .",
    "the gpe is obtained from mean - field many - body quantum - statistical theory and has been proven to explain the condensate state of dilute bose system satisfactorily .",
    "although no direct experimental observation of 2d bec has been reported yet , recent theoretical works suggest a possibility of 2d bec in a trapped condition .",
    "however , most of the theoretical approaches for 2d bec have been rather indirect and sometimes even faced with several difficulties .",
    "tempere and devreese @xcite studied harmonically - interacting bosons in 2d .",
    "they calculated the critical temperature from a grand - partition function to show the occurrence of 2d bec , but without any knowledge of the 2d condensate wave function for the density profile .",
    "@xcite studied the 2d vortex state by direct substitution of the 3d interaction strength @xmath0",
    "( @xmath1 is the s - wave scattering length in 3d and @xmath2 is the atomic mass ) into the 2d gpe , which resulted in a dimensional inconsistency .",
    "@xcite solved the 2d gpe using the two - fluid model a density estimation and obtained the temperature dependence of the internal energy and condensate fraction , where the 2d interaction strength was still treated just as a free variable .",
    "@xcite calculated the density profile and ground state energy for a finite number of 2d bose particles by diagonalizing the hamiltonian numerically , where a modified 2d interaction strength was used to solve the dimensional inconsistency .",
    "analytical approach of interacting bosons in 2d trap by 2d nonlinear gpe was attempted by gonzalez _ et .",
    "@xcite , and they studied the ground - state energy density by applying the haugset _",
    "s modified form of the 2d interaction strength to the 2d gpe .",
    "previous 2d researches are based on the size - independent concepts : if the atomic motion in any one axis is frozen completely in the ground state , the system is considered as two - dimension .",
    "moreover , most of the studies considered the 2d trap as an extremely anisotropic 3d trap and still far from the pure 2d system . on the other hand",
    ", we will focus on the 2d system which is confined by a 2d harmonic trap in @xmath3-direction and by ideal rigid walls in @xmath4-direction @xcite . in this system",
    ", the 2d interaction strength has a logarithmic form which will be derived using a 2d scattering theory in the next section .",
    "quasi-2d atomic systems , where atoms follow the 2d kinematics with the 3d interactions @xcite , have been recently realized for spin - polarized atomic hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of liquid helium @xcite and quasi - condensation has been indirectly demonstrated @xcite .",
    "although no pure 2d bec has been studied experimentally yet , the 2d gpe is quite valid even in quasi-2d at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "moreover it will provide us a guide to a better understanding of the 2d statistical properties of the quasi-2d system .    in this paper",
    ", we will solve the 2d gpe numerically and show the existence of the 2d bec directly by obtaining the stable condensate wave functions and the 2d ground state energy density of the trapped bose atoms .",
    "possible vortex states in 2d are also discussed .",
    "the results of the 2d bose condensation are then compared with those of the well - known 3d cases .",
    "the relation between interaction strength , @xmath5 , and the s - wave scattering length , @xmath1 , is well - known in 3d as @xmath6 .",
    "however , the 3d result is not applicable to a 2d gpe : substitution of the 3d relation into the 2d gpe results in dimensional inconsistency . as a first step to obtain the correct 2d gpe , the interaction strength in 2d",
    "is derived from the following 2d scattering theory @xcite .",
    "we begin with the 2d time - independent schrdinger equation with the interaction @xmath7 , given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the reduced mass of two particles ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "one can find the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) with the help of the 2d green s function @xmath12    the general solution of the 2d green s function is the hankel function @xcite . therefore the 2d wave function can be expressed as @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the first kind hankel function of order zero defined by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are bessel and neumann function of order zero . for large @xmath18 , it has the asymptotic behavior @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an integer .",
    "the born approximation is applied to the last step , and @xmath21 .    in 2d , for large @xmath18 , the scattered wave function should have the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the first - order born scattering amplitude in 2d which has a dimension of @xmath24 .",
    "this asymptotic formula should be a solution of the time independent schrdinger equation ( [ 1 ] ) , and satisfy @xmath25 limit of the green s function solution .",
    "the scattering cross - section in 2d now has the dimension of _ length _ given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are incident and scattered flux densities .",
    "we note that the total scattering cross - section for small @xmath29 should be @xmath30 in 2d instead of @xmath31 in 3d .",
    "if one assumes the delta - function type interaction @xmath32 the 2d scattering amplitude @xmath23 is obtained in the complex form from eqs .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) as @xmath33    the next step is to find the relation between the scattering amplitude and the scattering length in 2d .",
    "the well - known relation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the 3d scattering amplitude and @xmath1 is the s - wave scattering length in 3d , is not directly applicable in 2d . in general , the s - wave scattering length in 2d , @xmath36 , is different from the one in 3d , @xmath1 , and the s - wave scattering length in 2d is not known yet from experiment .    the relation is obtained from partial wave analysis of collision theory .",

    "\\label{161}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the necessary condition for the validity of the born approximation is that the phase shift @xmath48 be very small for small @xmath29 , which can be easily confirmed from eq .",
    "( [ 163 ] ) .",
    "note that unlike the 3d case where @xmath1 can be negative , we do not consider the negative scattering length here since the centrifugal potential of the lowest partial wave is negative in 2d so that the extrapolated local wave function cuts the radial axis always above the origin @xcite .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , the scattering amplitude is written as a series expansion , and the @xmath46 state contributes to the 2d system .",

    "note that the logarithmic dependence of the interaction term suggests similar condensate characteristics in 2d for most bosonic alkali atoms with positive scattering length .",
    "in addition to the 2d scattering length , @xmath36 , we do not have any reliable value of the wave - vector , @xmath29 , in 2d .",
    "an approximation that the wave - vector @xmath29 be the inverse of the largest distance available in the perpendicular direction may not be correct .",

    "the spatial distribution of the condensate in 2d is much broader than that in 3d , and the condensate wave functions approach the parabolic limit more rapidly with the increase of the number of atoms . in other words , the effect of atomic interaction potential",

    "we also observe that the 2d vortex has a larger radius than the 3d one .    the critical angular velocity or the energy difference between the vortex state of @xmath89 and the ground state @xmath90 in eq . ( [ 13 ] )",
