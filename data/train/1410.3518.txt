    "* ) carried out during july 2007 as part of program go-30848 ( mipscar ; n. smith , pi ) provided 24.0 @xmath0 m imaging with approximately 6@xmath5 resolution @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the irac and mips images to eros was dramatically reduced in the central regions of the carina nebula by the extreme mid - ir brightness of @xmath3 car and source confusion in the dense clusters tr 14 and tr 16 .",
    "@xmath3 car itself was intentionally avoided by the mipscar observation .",
    "the individual irac and mips frames were combined into large mosaics ( 1.2  pixel scale ) using the glimpse data reduction pipeline @xcite .",
    "`` residual images , '' or mosaics with the point sources removed , are an advanced data product produced by the glimpse pipeline and used in this study , as they facilitate photometry of extended sources such as eros .",
    "the residual images ( images with point sources removed ) were produced by performing point spread function fitting using a modified version ( babler 2006 ) of daophot @xcite on individual irac frames .",
    "the residual image tiles are mosaics from individual frame residuals . thus if a source is extracted in some but not all frames it will show up in these images as a source .",
    "sources may not be extracted for a variety of reasons , mainly due to cosmic ray contamination , saturation / non - linearity limits and along frame edges .",
    "the data used by s10 consisted of a earlier and deeper set of irac observations limited to the south pillars and south - western region of the nebula , avoiding the bright central regions surrounding tr 16 and tr 14 as well as the fields to the north . utilizing the wider - field , vela - carina survey data allowed us to search the nebula in its entirety and enlarge our ero candidate sample .    as part of an observing campaign targeting known and candidate ob stars in the carina nebula ( noao proposal # 2013a-0181 ; m. s. povich , pi ) , on 18 march 2013 we obtained spectra at 39754225   and 42504500   for 15 candidate ero driving stars , including 4 lacking previous classifications , using the 2df / aaomega spectrgraph on the australian astronomical telescope ( aat ) .",

    "relative strengths of he@xmath6 4200 and he@xmath6 4026 were used most often to determine the spectral class for o stars .",

    "the original s10 ero selection criterion only identified eros with some apparent arc - shaped morphology .",
    "we widened the original s10 selection criteria to include any visible extended emission at 8.0 @xmath0 m in close proximity to or shrouding a possible driving star , but apparently isolated from larger nebular structures .",
    "our revised selection criteria , as well as the use of the wider - field vela  carina mosaics , allowed us to identify 32 additional candidate eros beyond those originally found by s10 , without bias for ero emission , shape , or orientation , for a total sample of 39 eros , including 7 from s10 ( ero s1 from s10 was excluded from our sample , because it lacks an obvious driving star and is not sufficiently isolated from larger nebular structures ) .",

    "bow shock candidates ( mbsc and cbsc ) associated with ob stars are of particular interest as probes of massive star feedback processes and the relative motions between massive stars and the ism in regions .",
    "eros 1 , 3 , 24 , 31 , 37 and 39 , all located in the south pillars region , are generally aligned with the various pillars ( s10 ) and oriented in the inward direction toward tr 14 & 16 ( figure  [ fig : carinamap ] ) .",
    "this preferred orientation suggests that these bow shocks are caused by the interaction of the driving ob stellar wind with with the global feedback processes ( thermal gas pressure , radiation pressure , and/or cluster winds ) powering the expansion of the region and eroding the pillars .",
    "eros 2 , 22 , and 23 are all in closer proximity to tr 14 than to tr 16 , and are all oriented toward the centre of the tr 14 cluster , indicating that they are reacting to feedback from tr 14 only .",
    "no eros appear oriented toward tr 16 but not tr 14 ; this may be due to the fact that tr 14 is a very dense , centrally concentrated cluster while tr 16 is a looser aggregate of multiple subclusters @xcite .",
    "ero 5 is a particularly interesting case .",
    "it is apparently driven by the visual binary stars hd 93249 ( or cd58 3536a ) and cd58 3536b , the most luminous members of the tr 15 cluster @xcite .",
    "ero 5 is oriented directly toward the centre of the tr 14 cluster , however , providing direct evidence that feedback from tr 14 completely overwhelms that of the significantly older , less massive and less luminous tr 15 .",
    "this evidence of physical interaction between the clusters provides further support that both clusters are at the same heliocentric distance and hence part of the carina nebula complex .",
    "five bow shock candidates assoicated with ob stars , eros 4 , 6 , 20 , 29 , and 36 , are not oriented toward the centre of the carina nebula .",
    "these divergent orientations have two possible causes : ( 1 ) locally non - radial components to the ambient ism flow , perhaps produced by photoevaporative flows off of nearby molecular clouds ( s10 ) , or ( 2 ) high space velocity of the driving star , as with the candidate `` runaway '' ob stars identified via ir bow shocks found near other massive galactic star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "ero 4 is perhaps the best candidate for a bow shock interacting with a photoevaporative flow , as it is oriented toward the inner side of the large pillar demarcating the western boundary of the south pillars region .",
    "ero 29 is a candidate runaway o8 v star , as it is located on the northern periphery of the carina nebula and is oriented almost precisely outward from the centre ( figure  [ fig : carinamap ] ) . to confirm the runaway star scenario requires a better understanding of the complex kinematics of the carina stellar population . interpreting velocity measurements for individual ob stars",
    "begins with defining a reliable reference frame , correcting for galactic rotation and streaming motions , as well as accounting for cluster dynamics .",
    "additional radial velocity and proper motion data should give further insight to the potential runaway status of the carina bow shock driving stars in the future .",
    "[ [ physical - conditions - governing - emission - processes - and - colors - of - ir - bow - shocks ] ] physical conditions governing emission processes and colors of ir bow shocks ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    our analysis of the ir colors of eros ( section  [ sec : colors ] ) supports the conclusions of p08 , s10 , and @xcite that ir emission from bow shocks associated with ob stars in regions originates from dust entrained within the ( pre - shock ) plasma and heated by the nearby ob star ( p08 ) . because o and b - type stars are are not efficient dust producers , we echo s10 in proposing that the source of dust is ( photo)evaporating molecular clouds , such as the molecular cloud formations being ablated in the south pillars region .",
    "@xcite calculated that dust on the order of @xmath20  @xmath0 m  will typically be evacuated from a wind - blown region cavity on time - scales of @xmath21 years , and any dust grains on the order of @xmath22  @xmath0 m  will be destroyed , hence dust must be continually replenished and likely does not survive passage through the stellar - wind bow shocks .",
    "the wind momenta of massive stars places additional constraints on the types of stars that can drive ir bow shocks , because the winds can not be so strong such that they completely clear away the surrounding dust and gas ( p08 , s10 ) .",
    "this interpretation favors ir bow shocks forming around late o and early b stars on the periphery of young , dusty , star - forming regions , fitting the general picture of the carina nebula ( figure  [ fig : carinamap ] ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that dusty bow shocks associated with early - type stars generally occupy regions of ir color space that are distinct from the colors of the most likely contaminating sources , pah nebular knots and ysos .",
    "pah knots are redder in @xmath12-[8.0]$ ] but bluer in @xmath16-[24]$ ] compared to cbsc .",
    "this is explained by the presence of strong pah emission features falling within the [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] bandpasses but not in the [ 4.5 ] or [ 24 ] bandpasses .",
    "evidently ir bow shocks associated with ob stars do not excite strong pah emission , and this explains why eros are visually distinguishable from the ambient pah nebulosity in our multiband  color images ( figure  [ fig : eros ] ) .",
    "there are several possible physical reasons for this dearth of pah emission : ( 1 ) the dust entrained within the bow shocks was pah - depleted already , typical for dust within regions @xcite , ( 2 ) pah molecules mixed within the pre - shock gas and dust are destroyed by fuv radiation from the ob driving star , or ( 3 ) pah molecules are destroyed by the passage through the shock front itself .",
    "cbsc are redder than ysos in @xmath13-[8.0]$ ] ( figure  [ fig:23vs34_povich_nonumbers ] ) , but the @xmath16-[24]$ ] colors of cbsc are similar to disc - dominated ysos , and protostars extend to much redder @xmath16-[24]$ ] colors ( figure  [ fig:24vs45_ysos ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the emitting dust in bow shocks is generally warmer than the dust in protoplanetary discs and protostellar envelopes .",
    "another difference is that ysos , especially protostars , often exhibit deep silicate absorption at @xmath23  @xmath0 m , which suppresses flux in the [ 8.0 ] band .",
    "this absorption is not expected to be present in ir bow shocks , which should be optically thin ( p08 ) and possibly exhibit the silicate feature in _",
    "emission_.      following p08 , we quantify the physical parameters governing the observed bow shock morphology to measure the momentum flux of the ambient ism at different locations within the carina nebula .",
    "we calculate the ambient momentum flux of the ambient ism at the standoff distance @xmath24 of the bow shock , that is , the point at which momentum flux is balanced by the driving star s stellar wind , as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the _ relative _ velocity between the driving star and the ambient ism .",
    "we normalize the values for mean ism particle density , stellar mass - loss rates , and terminal wind velocities such that @xmath27 @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 m@xmath30 yr@xmath2 ) , and @xmath31 cm s@xmath2 ) , following @xcite , p08 , and @xcite . assuming that mass - loss about the star is spherically symmetric , it can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 g is the mean ism gas mass per hydrogen atom . solving for @xmath26",
    ", we have @xmath34.\\ ] ] the resulting values for @xmath35 derived from each of the mbsc , are presented in table  [ tab : bowshockdrivingstars ] .",
    "these are comparable to values cited by p08 , indicating that overall the mbsc in the carina nebula probe similar ism conditions as found in m17 and rcw 49 .",
    "as found by @xcite , and noted in p08 , mass - loss rates have a high dependence on spectral type and are therefore the largest source of uncertainty in our calculations .",
    "indeed , citing the high uncertainty in mass - loss rates , @xcite turned the problem around , assuming reasonable values for the ambient density and relative velocities of ob stars to the ism to use bow shocks as constraints on the stellar wind momentum and hence mass - loss rates .",
    "equation 1 must be interpreted with caution .",
    "order - of - magnitude uncertainties in mass - loss rates @xcite create factors of @xmath19 uncertainty in @xmath26 .",
    "all results are modulo an unknown inclination angle with respect to the plane of the sky ( although @xmath36 is likely to be near unity for mbsc , otherwise the arc shape would not be visually apparent , see p08 ) .",
    "the density of ionized plasma in the carina nebula likely varies by factors of several about the typical value of @xmath37 @xcite , but this effect is subordinate to the uncertainties in the mass - loss rates . more importantly , the derived values for @xmath26 ( assuming @xmath37 ) are comparable to the @xmath1  km  @xmath2 sound speed in the ionized plasma . in the case where the relative velocity between the star and the ambient ism is not highly supersonic ,",
    "thermal ( and possibly turbulent ) pressure in the ambient medium become important relative to ram pressure in balancing the stellar wind pressure .",
    "accounting for thermal pressure adds a term , proportional to the square of the sound speed , to our momentum flux balance equation , which becomes @xmath38 ( note that the wind itself is highly supersonic , hence the thermal pressure term on the left - hand side can still be safely neglected ) .",
    "normalizing the ambient temperature to @xmath39  k ) , we derive a correction to the relative velocity from equation 1 , @xmath40 this correction is independent of the ambient density , and for regions @xmath41 is near unity .",
    "we can thus apply equation 2 to correct our values of @xmath42 for the expected contribution of thermal pressure , except for two cases ( eros 1 and 37 ) where the thermal pressure term exceeds the ram pressure term ( @xmath43  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "corrected values of @xmath44 are included in table  [ tab : bowshockdrivingstars ] ; in the majority of cases these corrections are small compared to the uncertainties in @xmath26 .",
    "s10 used the observed bow shock standoff distances to contrain the _ total _ pressure in the ambient medium balanced by the stellar wind pressure , @xmath45.\\ ] ] this approach does not assume any particular geometry for the shock front , does not require a distinction of ram pressure from other sources of ambient pressure , and does not depend on the density or temperature of the ambient gas .",
    "equation 3 is , however , more sensitive to uncertainties in mass - loss rates and standoff distances than equation 1 .",
    "we list values for @xmath46 dyne @xmath47 ) in table  [ tab : bowshockdrivingstars ] , these are consistent with the values of @xmath48 , 4.8 , and 8.6 derived for eros 1 , 3 and 4 , respectively , by s10 , the differences reflecting the adoption of different mass - loss rates for the driving stars ."
