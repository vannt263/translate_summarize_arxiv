    "invariant differential operators play very important role in the description of physical symmetries . in a recent paper @xcite we started the systematic explicit construction of invariant differential operators .",
    "we gave an explicit description of the building blocks , namely , the parabolic subgroups and subalgebras from which the necessary representations are induced .",
    "thus we have set the stage for study of different non - compact groups and induction from different parabolics .    in the present paper we focus on the algebra  @xmath0   and representations induced from the maximal cuspidal parabolic .",
    "this paper is a sequel of @xcite and we refer to it and @xcite for motivations and extensive list of literature on the subject .",
    "let @xmath1 be a semisimple non - compact lie group , and @xmath2 a maximal compact subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "then we have an iwasawa decomposition  @xmath3 , where  @xmath4   is abelian simply connected vector subgroup of  @xmath1 ,  @xmath5   is a nilpotent simply connected subgroup of  @xmath1   preserved by the action of  @xmath4 .",
    "further , let @xmath6 be the centralizer of @xmath4 in @xmath2 . then the subgroup  @xmath7   is a minimal parabolic subgroup of @xmath1 . a parabolic subgroup  @xmath8   is any subgroup of @xmath1 which contains a minimal parabolic subgroup .",
    "the importance of the parabolic subgroups comes from the fact that the representations induced from them generate all ( admissible ) irreducible representations of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "actually , induction from the cuspidal parabolic subgroups is enough for this classification result .    for our purposes",
    "here we restrict to  _ maximal _   cuspidal parabolic subgroups  @xmath9 , so that @xmath10 .",
    "let  @xmath11   be a ( non - unitary ) character of  @xmath12 ,  @xmath13 , let  @xmath14   fix an discrete series representation  @xmath15   of  @xmath16   on a vector space  @xmath17 , or a limit thereof .",
    "we consider induced representation  @xmath18 ind@xmath19 .",
    "these belong to the family of  _ elementary representations _ of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "( they are called _ generalized principal series representations _ ( or _ limits thereof _ ) in mathematical literature @xcite . )",
    "their spaces of functions are : _",
    "=   \\ { c^(g , v _ )    ( gman )  =   e^-(h ) d^(m^-1 ) ( g ) } where  @xmath20 ,  @xmath21 ,  @xmath22 ,  @xmath23 .",
    "the representation action is the @xmath24 regular action : ( ^(g ) ) ( g )  =   ( g^-1g )  , g , gg  .note that for our considerations it is enough to use the infinitesimal left action : ( x_l ) ( g )   d dt ( ( -tx)g)_t=0     an important ingredient in our considerations are the  _ highest weight representations _   of  @xmath25   associated to the er  @xmath26 . these can be realized as ( factor - modules of ) verma modules  @xmath27   over  @xmath28 , where  @xmath29 ,  @xmath30 is a cartan subalgebra of  @xmath28 , the weight  @xmath31   is determined uniquely from @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we recall that the verma module is explicitly given by  @xmath33 , where we employ the triangular decomposition of  @xmath34  :   @xmath35 ,  @xmath36   being the raising , lowering generators of @xmath34 .",
    "to employ this hwm structure we shall use the _ right action _ of  @xmath34   by the standard formula : ( x_r ) ( g )   d dt ( g(tx))_t=0  , where  @xmath37 ,  @xmath38 , first  @xmath39 , then we use complex linear extension to extend this action to  @xmath34 . note that this action takes  @xmath40   out of  @xmath41   for some @xmath42 but that is exactly why it is used for the construction of the .",
    "further we need to introduce @xmath43-valued realization @xmath44 of the space @xmath41 by the formula : ( g )   u_0 , ( g ) where  @xmath45   is the @xmath16-invariant scalar product in @xmath46 ,  @xmath47   is the highest weight vector in the discrete series representation space  @xmath17 , or the limit thereof .    on these functions the left / right action of  @xmath34",
    "is defined by : ( x_l / r ) ( g )  u_0 , ( x_l / r ) ( g )    generically , verma modules are irreducible , but for the construction of we need the reducible ones .",
    "there is a simple criterion @xcite : the _ verma module @xmath27 is reducible _ if holds  , ^2 / ( , )  where  @xmath48 ( the positive roots of  @xmath49 ) , @xmath50 ,  @xmath51   is the bilinear product in @xmath52 ,  @xmath53   is half the sum of the positive roots .",
    "whenever the above is fulfilled there exists @xcite in  @xmath27   a submodule which is also a verma module with shifted weight :  @xmath54 .",
    "this submodule is generated by a unique vector @xmath55 , called  _ singular vector _ , such that @xmath56 and it has the properties of the highest weight vector of  @xmath54  : & & x v_s  =   ( - m)(x ) v_s  , x ^ + & & x v_s  =   0  ,",
    "+    the above situation will be depicted as follows : v^  v^ - m the arrow points  _ to _   the submodule @xcite .",
    "the singular vector is expressed via @xcite @xmath57 where  @xmath58   is a polynomial in the universal enveloping algebra  @xmath59",
    ".    then there exists @xcite an  _ _   of order  @xmath60  : _ m ,  :   _ (  )   _ (  - m ) given explicitly by : where  @xmath61   denotes the _ right action _ of the elements of  @xmath62   on the functions  @xmath63 .",
    "thus , in each such situation we have an  _ invariant differential equation _   of order  @xmath60  :  , _ (  )  ,  _ (  - m )    one main ingredient of our approach is as follows .",
    "we group the ( reducible ) ers with the same casimirs in sets called  _ multiplets _ @xcite .",
    "the multiplet corresponding to fixed values of the casimirs may be depicted as a connected graph , the vertices of which correspond to the reducible ers and the lines between the vertices correspond to intertwining operators .",
    "the explicit parametrization of the multiplets and of their ers is important for understanding of the situation .",
    "in fact , the multiplets contain explicitly all the data necessary to construct the , as we shall demonstrate .",
    "let  @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "it has three nonconjugate parabolic subalgebras :  & = &   + _ 0  & = &   so(n-2 ) _ 0 _ 0 + & & _ 0 = 2  , _ 0 = 2(n-1 ) + _ 1  & = &   so(n-2 ) sl(2 , ) _ 1 _ 1 + & & _ 1 = 1  , _ 1 = 2n-3",
    "+ _ 2  & = &   so(n-1,1 ) _ 2 _ 2 + & & _ 2 = 1  , _ 2 = n where  @xmath66   is the minimal parabolic ,  @xmath67   is maximal cuspidal ,  @xmath68   is maximal noncuspidal . usually it is the latter that is used , but in the present paper we study induction from the maximal cuspidal parabolic subalgebra  @xmath69 .      for  @xmath0",
    "the maximal cuspidal parabolic is : _",
    "1  =   so(2 ) sl(2 , ) _ 1 _ 1 @xmath70 ,  @xmath71 .",
    "the signatures of the ers are   _ 1  =   \\{n,k,, } where  @xmath72   is a character of  @xmath73 ,  @xmath74   is a character of  @xmath75 ,  @xmath76   fix a discrete series representation of  @xmath77 ,  @xmath78 ,  @xmath79 , or a limit thereof when @xmath80 .",
    "the relation with the  @xmath81   dynkin labels is as follows @xcite : m_1  =   ( k-+n )  , m_2  =   -k  , m_3  =   ( k- -n )    the main multiplet of reducible ers contains 12 members which we parametrize as part of the main  @xmath81   multiplet with 24 members .",
    "thus , the 12-plet has the following signatures : & & _2  =   ( m_12,-m_2,m_23 )  =   \\{n  =  m_1-m_3 , k  =  m_2,  =  -m_13 } + & & _12  =   ( m_2,-m_12,m_13 )  =   \\{-m_1-m_3 , m_12,-m_23 } + & & _32  =   ( m_13,-m_23,m_2 )  =   \\ { m_1+m_3 , m_23,-m_12 } + & & _121  =   ( -m_2,-m_1,m_13 )  =   \\{-m_13-m_2 , m_1 , -m_3 } + & & _132  =   ( m_23,-m_13,m_12 )  =   \\{m_3-m_1 , m_13 , -m_2 } + & & _232  =   ( m_13,-m_3,-m_2 )  =   \\{m_13+m_2 , m_3,-m_1 } + & & _1232  =   ( m_23,-m_3,-m_12 )  =   \\{m_13+m_2 , m_3 , m_1 } + & & _1321  =   ( -m_23,-m_1,m_12 )  =   \\ { -m_13-m_2 , m_1,m_3 } + & & _2132  =   ( m_3,-m_13,m_1 )  =   \\ { m_3-m_1 , m_13,m_2 } + & & _12132  =   ( m_3,-m_23,-m_1 )  =   \\ { m_1+m_3,m_23,m_12 } + & & _21321  =   ( -m_3,-m_12,m_1 )  =   \\{-m_1-m_3,m_12,m_23 } + & & _121321  =   ( -m_3,-m_2,-m_1 )  =   \\ { m_1-m_3,m_2 , m_13 } where   @xmath82 @xmath83 ,  @xmath84 , are the three simple @xmath81 reflections ,  @xmath85   is the er , or rather the corresponding verma module with dominant highest weight with signature  @xmath86 ,  @xmath87 , which module is fixing the @xmath81 24-plet .",
    "we have given the signature in both the @xmath81 signature notation @xmath88 and in the  @xmath67-induced notation .",
    "we would like to follow connections with ers induced from the maximal noncuspidal parabolic @xmath89 .",
    "thus , below we shall replace the  @xmath90   notation with equivalent one : @xmath91    thus , we give the same 12-plet in  @xmath92   parametrization and adding the harish - chandra ( hc ) parameters @xcite for the three nonsimple roots in the order  @xmath93 .",
    "thus , in the 4-th,5-th,6-th , place the parameters are  :  @xmath94 , and of course they are redundant but some representation theoretic statements are formulated easier in their terms . in particular , the @xmath2-noncompact hc parameters are :  @xmath95 .",
