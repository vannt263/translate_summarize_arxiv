    "optical atomic clocks have surpassed state - of - the art microwave clocks in terms of accuracy and stability and allow targeting fractional inaccuracies of 1 part in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a crucial element in achieving this performance are ultrastable lasers which currently limit the short term stability of state - of - the - art optical clocks @xcite .",
    "thus , development of techniques to improve the performance of the ultrastable interrogation lasers is a rapidly evolving field @xcite .",
    "already today , ultrastable lasers are demanding and cost - intensive devices , and it is becoming apparent , that future 100  mhz linewidth lasers will even more increase in complexity and costs , making these systems affordable possibly only in a few laboratories .",
    "thus , methods are required , to provide these ultrastable optical frequencies to remote laboratories over large distances with highly demanding short term stability . direct comparisons of optical clocks or even only state - of - the - art lasers are difficult , since today , the complex setup of an optical clock does not allow for transportation .",
    "since the first demonstrations @xcite , phase - coherent long - range dissemination and remote characterization of ultrastable optical frequencies have therefore become an important tool in frequency metrology .",
    "the most promising method with the highest demonstrated stability directly transmits the ultrastable optical carrier via phase - stabilized fibers @xcite and was applied to remote optical clock comparisons over distances of 3.5 km @xcite .",
    "long - range comparisons recommend usage of commercial telecommunication fiber networks and transfer at 1.5  @xmath5 m @xcite .        in this work",
    "we realized a remote comparison of 73  km - distant , independent ultrastable optical frequencies on the @xmath6 level in fractions of a second via a long - distance telecommunication fiber network .",
    "this represents a remote optical frequency comparison with an unprecedented resolution on short time scales .",
    "the focus of our work was to explore the capability of long - distance fiber links for comparing optical frequencies with high short term stability .",
    "thus , investigating possible limitations on the achievable short term performance of the whole dissemination chain .",
    "the achieved short term stability at 100  ms is a tenfold improvement to previous remote comparisons of optical frequencies .",
    "the demonstrated performance allows remote dissemination of the stability of 100  mhz linewidth lasers within seconds . with our setup",
    "we are able to reveal the flicker floor of our ultrastable lasers of @xmath0 in only 0.1  s averaging time .",
    "this represents a real - time application of a long - distance fiber link at the performance - level of state - of - the - art optical clocks . in combination with sophisticated fiber stabilization systems @xcite ,",
    "the results confirm the potential of long - distance fiber links for comparing optical clocks at the level of @xmath2 or below in a few minutes .",
    "the lasers compared in this work are separated by more than 50  km geographical distance .",
    "the individual laser systems are used for a calcium optical frequency standard located at the physikalisch - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) in braunschweig and for a magnesium optical frequency standard at the institute of quantum optics ( iq ) at the university of hanover .",
    "the experimental setup is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "in hanover , currently two ultrastable laser systems are in operation , l1 and l2",
    ". both are diode lasers systems at 914 nm , which are stabilized to two independent ultrastable optical resonators .",
    "l1 uses a horizontal resonator ( finesse @xmath7 ) mounted in a multistage spring pendulum configuration for vibration isolation .",
    "l2 is stabilized to a horizontal resonator ( @xmath8 ) mounted near the symmetry plane for reduced vibrational sensitivity , similar to a design used in @xcite .",
    "these systems are compared to an ultrastable laser located at ptb via a 73  km long telecommunication fiber to iq .",
    "the ultrastable master laser ( ml ) at ptb is a diode laser system at 657  nm stabilized to a vibrationally insensitive optical resonator reaching a demonstrated linewidth at hz level @xcite and a flicker floor of @xmath9 for @xmath10  s @xcite .",
    "its stability is transferred to a 1542  nm fiber laser ( tl ) by means of a femtosecond frequency comb @xcite .",
    "we inject about 5  mw of the light of tl into the 73  km long fiber link to iq , connected via the local computer center in hanover ( rz - h ) . at iq , the light",
    "is amplified in a bidirectional erbium doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) , frequency shifted with an acousto - optic modulator ( aom 2 ) and afterwards partially reflected back to ptb , using a faraday rotator mirror . at ptb ,",
    "the back reflected light is used for active cancellation of phase noise of the fiber by servo feedback to aom 1 .",
    "the servo bandwidth of the noise cancellation loop is limited to @xmath11  700  hz due to fiber length @xcite .",
    "the single pass loss in the 73  km fiber is @xmath11  23  db .",
    "information about the stabilization system and the link between ptb and rz - h can be found in @xcite .",
    "part of the transmitted light at 1542  nm is coupled out at iq and used for comparison to l1 and l2 at 914  nm by means of a second frequency comb .",
    "both frequency combs are based on femtosecond erbium fiber lasers which are frequency doubled into the visible .",
    "thus , optical frequencies even far outside from the telecommunication window at 1.5  @xmath5 m can be remotely compared via the fiber link using the transfer laser at 1542  nm without degrading the stability or accuracy @xcite .",
    "the remote comparison of the ultrastable optical frequencies is performed in the time and frequency domains . in the time domain ,",
    "all frequencies are recorded simultaneously by using a multichannel frequency counter with synchronous readout and zero deadtime .",
    "this can be operated either with a simple single average per gate time ( so called @xmath12 estimator ) or using overlapping multiple averages within the gate period ( overlapping @xmath13 estimator ) @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the transfer beat @xmath14 between the delivered cw light @xmath15 at 1542 nm and the 914 nm cw light @xmath16 of the local ultrastable lasers is calculated using the relation @xmath17 by measuring the mode numbers @xmath18 , @xmath19 of the frequency comb , the carrier - envelope offset frequency @xmath20 , and the beat note frequencies @xmath21 , @xmath22 between the cw frequencies and the corresponding comb modes .",
    "@xmath15 at 1542  nm is thereby measured using the fundamental comb spectrum , @xmath23 , and @xmath16 at 914  nm using the frequency doubled comb spectrum , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the repetition rate of the frequency comb .",
    "first , we performed a remote comparison between the three independent laser systems .",
    "this enabled us to identify the system that provides the best stability for the investigation of the achievable short term performance of the remote comparison .",
    "the results of the remote characterization of the three independent laser systems are depicted in fig .",
    "[ stability ] . the allan deviation ( adev ) shown",
    "is obtained by operating the counter with a simple single average per gate time ( @xmath12 estimator ) .",
    "l2 shows a drift rate of several @xmath6/s and l1 of @xmath6/s , which we attribute to temperature fluctuations of the ultrastable resonators .",
    "the drift rate of ml , and thus tl , was identified independently at ptb using a hydrogen maser as @xmath26/s . with linear drift correction , for @xmath27  s tl is identified as the most stable laser , and l2 as more stable than l1 ( fig .",
    "[ stability ] ) . also shown in fig .",
    "[ stability ] is the link instability of @xmath28 , estimated @xcite from independent ptb - iq - ptb round - trip measurements . according to these estimates ,",
    "it is reasonable that the observed measurement performance between l2 and tl is limited by the link instability up to 1  s.      to go beyond this limitation and to check for other possible noise sources that are not only introduced by the fiber link itself but also by other components of the whole dissemination chain , as e.g. the two independent frequency combs , we performed phase - averaged data acquisition .",
    "we implemented a data evaluation based on the modified allan deviation ( modadev ) , which is obtained ( case ( c ) in @xcite ) by operating the counter with overlapping multiple averages per gate time ( overlapping @xmath13 estimator , with an internal gate time of 1  ms ) . while leaving the instability contributions of frequency modulation noise processes unaffected ( within 30% error @xcite ) , the contribution of white phase noise - which is typical for residual link fluctuations - falls off as @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ modallan ] depicts the modadev for the l2-tl comparison .",
    "also shown is the instability of the 73  km link , as estimated from independent round - trip measurements ptb - iq - ptb .",
    "the modadev of the link behaves as @xmath30 .",
    "thus , at 1  s measurement time , the link instability contribution is reduced by a factor of 30 .",
    "the l2-tl trace coincides with the estimated link instability for very short time scales , i.e. no significant additional measurement noise or laser noise could be detected .",
    "the performance of the remote laser comparison is already revealed after 100  ms and shows a flicker floor of @xmath0 .",
    "the combined thermal noise contributions of the resonators of l2 and ml is calculated @xcite to be @xmath31 .",
    "the remote measurement results are close to the performance of state - of - the - art ultrastable lasers , as represented in fig .",
    "[ modallan ] by the previous results of the _ local _ comparison of ml to the ultrastable interrogation laser yl of the yb@xmath32 experiment at ptb via 300  m of stabilized fiber @xcite .",
    "the achieved short term stability for the remote comparison is superior to any reported remote comparison of optical frequencies and shows an improvement at 100  ms of one order of magnitude to any published results .      for analysis in the frequency domain , we additionally implemented the operation in eq .",
    "( [ transfer ] ) ( divided by 4 ) by analog signal processing @xcite using a direct digital synthesizer and double - balanced mixers .",
    "the spectrum of the remote transfer beat note @xmath33 , at 48.5  thz , between l2 and tl is depicted in fig .",
    "[ transferbeat ] .",
    "it shows a linewidth of 1  hz , limited by the spectrum analyzer used . by analyzing the spectrum of the remote beat signal , we optimized the laser system l2 in real - time .",
    "the beat signal also enables remote phase locking of a laser to the transferred light at the noise level of the stabilized fiber .",
    "to conclude , we performed a remote comparison of ultrastable optical frequencies on the @xmath6 level on sub - second time scales .",
    "modadev based data evaluation suppresses residual fiber noise below @xmath34 in 1  s and enables rapid resolution of the transferred signal .",
    "this displays the enormous potential of dissemination of ultrastable optical frequencies using long - distance telecommunication fiber networks for frequency metrology .",
    "exciting applications are comparisons of optical clocks , remote high - precison spectroscopy or gravitational wave detectors .",
    "this work underlines the feasibility of expanding the distances bridged by the optical fiber links .",
    "thus , the vision of a national @xcite and european wide fiber network becomes a realistic scenario in the near future , which will strongly stimulate the field of fundamental physics and precison frequency metrology .",
