    "* preibisch  2005 ) ) . however , it is only in recent years that this result has become clear , with previous studies showing conflicting results ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent discrepancy arose from whether stars were classified as accreting based on the detection of excess ir emission ( a disk indicator ) or the detection of accretion related emission lines .",
    "however , with careful re - analysis of archival data ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* gdel , briggs , arzner ,  2007a ) ) the result is now clear , namely that accreting t tauri stars are observed to be , on average , less luminous in x - rays than non - accreting stars .",
    "although the difference is small it has been found consistently in various star forming regions : taurus - auriga ( ( * ? ? ?",

    ".    it should be noted , however , that such observations from ccd detectors are not very sensitive to x - rays that are produced in accretion shocks .",
    "high resolution x - ray spectroscopic measurements have indicated emission from cool and high density plasma , most likely associated with accretion hot spots , in several ( but not all ) accreting stars ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is not yet understood why accreting stars are under luminous in x - rays , although a few ideas have been put forward .",
    "it may be related to higher extinction due to x - ray absorption by circumstellar disks , however the coup results do not support this suggestion ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* preibisch  2005 ) ) .",
    "it may be related to magnetic braking , whereby the interaction between the magnetic field of an accreting star with its disk slows the stellar rotation rate leading to a weaker dynamo action and therefore less x - ray emission ; although the lack of any rotation - activity relation for t tauri stars has ruled out this idea ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "a third suggestion is that accretion may alter the stellar structure affecting the magnetic field generation process and therefore x - ray emission ( ( * ? ? ? * preibisch  2005 ) ) .",
    "however , the most plausible suggestion is the attenuation of coronal x - rays by the dense gas in accretion columns ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "x - rays from the underlying corona may not be able to heat the material within accretion columns to a high enough temperature to emit in x - rays .",
    "field lines which have been mass - loaded with dense disk material may obscure the line - of - sight to the star at some rotation phases , reducing the observed x - ray emission . here",
    "we demonstrate this in a quantitative way by developing an accretion flow model and simulating the propagation of coronal x - rays through the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "in order to model the coronae of t tauri stars we need to assume something about the form of the magnetic field .",
    "observations suggest it is compact and inhomogeneous and may vary not only with time on each star , but also from one star to the next . to capture this behaviour",

    "although we can not be certain whether or not the magnetic field structures extrapolated from surface magnetograms of young main sequence stars do represent the magnetically confined coronae of t tauri stars , they do satisfy the currently available observational constraints . in future",

    "the surface field structures are complex , consistent with polarisation measurements ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* valenti & johns - krull 2004 ) ) and x - ray emitting plasma is confined within unevenly distributed magnetic structures close to the stellar surface , giving rise to significant rotational modulation of x - ray emission ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the pressure is calculated along the path of field line loops and is set to zero for open field lines and for field lines where , at some point along the loop , the gas pressure exceeds the magnetic pressure .",
    "the pressure along a field line scales with the pressure at its foot point , and we assume that this scales with the magnetic pressure .",

    "the lq hya - like field has a more extended corona and consequently a lower coronal density and em , @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the structure of the magnetic field remains undistorted by the in - falling material and that the magnetosphere rotates as a solid body .",
    "the accreting field geometries shown in fig .",
    "[ coronae ] are therefore only snap - shots in time , and in reality will evolve due to the interaction with the disk .",
    "the question of where the disk is truncated remains a major problem for accretion models .",
    "it is still unknown if the disk is truncated in the vicinity of the corotation radius , the assumption of traditional accretion models ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * knigl 1991 ) ) , or whether it extends closer to the stellar surface ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* matt & pudritz 2005 ) ) . in this work",
    "we assume that accretion occurs over a range of radii within the corotation radius .",
    "this is equivalent to the approach taken previously by e.g. @xcite who have demonstrated that such an assumption reproduces observed spectral line profiles and variability .",
    "the accretion filling factors are of order @xmath9 , consistent with observationally inferred values ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* valenti & johns - krull 2004 ) ) .",
    "we assume that material is supplied by the disk and accretes onto the star at a constant rate . for a dipolar magnetic field accretion flows impact the stellar surface in two rings in opposite hemispheres centred on the poles . in this case ,",
    "half of the mass supplied by the disk accretes into each hemisphere . for complex magnetic fields accretion occurs into discrete hot spots distributed in latitude and longitude ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gregory  2006a ) ) .",
    "it is therefore not clear how much of the available mass from the disk accretes into each hot spot .",
    "we use a spherical grid and assume that each grid cell within the disk which is accreting supplies a mass accretion rate that is proportional to its surface area . if an accreting grid cell has a surface area that is @xmath10 of the total area of all accreting grid cells , then this grid cell is assumed to carry @xmath10 of the total mass that is supplied by the disk . therefore ,",
    "as an example , if grid cells which constitute half of the total area of all accreting cells in the disk carry material into a single hot spot , then half of the mass accretion rate is carried from the disk to this hot spot . in this way",
    "the accretion rate into each hot spot is different and depends on the structure of the magnetic field connecting the star to the disk .",
    "we consider a star of mass @xmath11 , radius @xmath12 , rotation period @xmath13 , a coronal temperature of @xmath14 and assume that the disk supplies a mass accretion rate of @xmath15 . in order to model the propagation of coronal x - rays through the magnetosphere we first need to determine the density of gas within accretion columns .",
    "* gregory , wood & jardine ( 2007 ) ) develop a steady state accretion flow model where material accretes from a range of radii within corotation , free - falling along the field lines under gravity .",
    "the resulting density profiles do not depend on the absolute field strength , but instead on how the field strength varies with height above the star .",
    "the density profiles are typically steeper than those derived for accretion flows along dipolar field lines since the strength of a higher order field drops faster with height above the star .",
    "[ flows ] shows the variation of the number density along the paths of a selection of accreting field lines , with those obtained for dipolar field lines shown for comparison ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the flow densities range from @xmath16 , whilst for a lower accretion rate of @xmath17 the range is @xmath18 .",
    "we model the propagation of coronal x - rays through the magnetosphere by considering absorption by the dense gas within accretion columns . for the radiation transfer we use monte carlo techniques and discretise the emissivity and density onto a spherical polar grid ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jardine  2002 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* whitney , wood , bjorkman ,  2003 ) ) .",
    "the stellar inclination is set to @xmath19 and we assume the x - ray emission from the @xmath14 corona is optically thin , but that the x - rays may be subsequently absorbed in the cool and hence optically thick accretion columns . for the x - ray absorptive opacity we adopt a value of @xmath20 , typical of neutral gas at temperatures below @xmath21 at x - ray energies of a few kev ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* krolik & kallman 1984 ) ) . at these energies",

    "[ coronae ] shows the x - ray images in the absence of attenuation ( i.e. x - ray opacity in the accretion columns is set to zero ) whilst the fourth row shows the same x - ray emission models , but with our adopted value for the soft x - ray opacity in the accretion columns .",
    "the observed x - ray em is reduced by a factor of 1.4 ( 2.0 ) for the ab dor - like ( lq hya - like ) field when accretion flows are considered , where the reduction factor is the average for an entire rotation cycle . for the ab dor - like field",
    "there are large accretion curtains which cross the observers line - of - sight to the star as it rotates ( see fig .",
    "[ coronae ] ) . for the lq hya - like field accretion is predominantly along field lines which carry material into low latitude hot spots , however , one of the brightest x - ray emitting regions is obscured by an accretion column which attenuates the coronal x - rays and produces a large reduction in the observed x - ray emission .",
    "this immediately suggests that the geometry of the accreting field is a contributory factor in causing the large scatter seen in the x - ray luminosities of accreting stars .",
    "we have demonstrated that the suppression of x - ray emission in accreting stars apparent from ccd observations can , at least in part , be explained by the attenuation of coronal x - rays by the dense material in accretion columns .",
    "this suggests that both accreting and non - accreting stars have the same intrinsic x - ray luminosity , with accreting t tauri stars being observed to be less luminous due to the effects of absorbing gas in accretion columns .",

    "a preliminary calculation indicates that the column densities from our simulations are large enough that the softer ( cooler ) coronal spectral components may be substantially , if not completely , absorbed by the accreting gas .",
    "the effect is greater the larger the accretion rate . indeed",
    "* gdel  ( 2007b ) ) have recently found that stars in xest which have the largest accretion rates ( and are driving jets ) show a highly absorbed coronal spectral component , which is attributed to attenuation by accreting gas .",
