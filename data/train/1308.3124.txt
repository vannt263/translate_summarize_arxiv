    "likewise , the first @xmath36 particles @xmath37 evolve without any dependence on those particles @xmath38 to their left .",
    "therefore , even though we have restricted our attention to an @xmath1-particle system , we may also think of this as the evolution of the @xmath1 rightmost particles in a system with more than @xmath1 particles .",

    "let us now explain how the @xmath0-pushasep situation differs from that of the @xmath0-tasep . for @xmath84 , the corresponding true evolution equations for any @xmath61 involve linear combinations of expectations of @xmath70 with @xmath76 running up to the boundary of @xmath71 .",
    "thus , it is not a priori clear how to write down the free evolution equations ( in @xmath72 ) for the @xmath0-pushasep such that their solutions satisfying the same @xmath77 boundary conditions coincide with solutions of the true evolution equations ( in @xmath71 ) .",
    "a way to write down the free evolution equations which we employ instead is to introduce _ another _ set of @xmath77 conditions which we call _",
    "cumulative_. for simpler notation , assume now that @xmath85 for all @xmath32 ( see  [ sec : free_q_pushasep ] for a general case ) .",

    "as before , @xmath91 means the application of the operator in the @xmath49th coordinate .",
    "we then obtain the _ free evolution equations _ for the @xmath0-pushasep which are constant coefficient and separable in @xmath72 , and prove that solutions of the free evolution equations satisfying  and having the right initial data inside @xmath71 coincide with solutions of the true evolution equations for the @xmath0-pushasep .    the emergence of the cumulative conditions which might seem somewhat mysterious from the bethe ansatz point of view ( cf .",

    "one readily sees that there exists a general class of solutions to the free evolution equations for the @xmath0-pushasep , but it is not immediately clear how one should combine them in the right way so that they satisfy . however , when the @xmath0-pushasep starts from the step initial configuration , it is possible to _ check _ that the nested contour integral expression in the right - hand side of satisfies the free evolution equations , @xmath77 boundary and @xmath77 cumulative conditions  , and has the right initial data , thus producing the desired moment formula .",

    "<S> we introduce a new interacting ( stochastic ) particle system @xmath0-pushasep which interpolates between the of @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the @xmath0-pushtasep introduced recently @xcite . in the @xmath0-pushasep , particles can jump to the left or to the right , and there is a certain partially asymmetric pushing mechanism present . </S>",
    "<S> this particle system has a nice interpretation as a model of traffic on a one - lane highway .    using the quantum many body system approach , we explicitly compute the expectations of a large family of observables for this system in terms of nested contour integrals . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss relevant fredholm determinantal formulas for the distribution of the location of each particle , and connections of the model with a certain two - sided version of macdonald processes and with the semi - discrete stochastic heat equation . </S>"
