    "a significant amount of theoretical work has shown that the spin of a supermassive black hole is likely to impact the properties of powerful collimated outflows from supermassive black hole systems .",

    "( 1986 ) , blandford ( 1990 ) , and meier ( 1999 ) and the more recent work of mckinney & gammie ( 2004 ) , mckinney ( 2005 , 2006 ) , hawley & krolik ( 2006 ) , tchekhovskoy et al .",

    "( 2015 ) to name a few , indicate that the spin of the hole may play a significant role in the beam power of outflows from black hole systems .",
    "empirical studies of agn with measured x - ray iron lines indicate that some of the sources have significant spin , as summarized in the recent review of reynolds ( 2014 ) ; selection effects may explain this as an observational bias ( reynolds 2015 ) .",
    "studies of agn with outflows analyzed in the context of particular models suggest that these sources have a broad range of spin values ( e.g. daly 2009 , 2011 ; gnedin et al . 2012 ; mikhailov et al . 2015 ) .",
    "spin values are likely to indicate whether the accretion history of the source under study was chaotic , leading to a low spin value ( king & pringle 2006 , 2007 ; king et al .",
    "2008 ) , or more smoothly progressing , leading to a high spin value ( volonteri et al . 2005 ; volonteri et al .",
    "2007 ; and dubois et al . 2014 ) .",
    "thus , studies of spins may indicate whether a chaotic or non - chaotic accretion history was likely to have been dominant for that class of source .",
    "the purpose of the work presented here is to study sources with powerful outflows to determine if the outflow and accretion disk properties of the systems provide indications of the spin characteristics of the sources .",
    "the sample of sources studied is described in section 2 , the analysis and results are presented in section 3 , and a discussion of the results and implications follows in section 4 .",
    "to study the relationship between beam power and accretion disk luminosity , a sample of sources for which these quantities are known was selected .",
    "beam powers , or energy per unit time carried by the outflow , can be determined from multi - frequency radio maps of extended powerful frii ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) ( classical double ) radio galaxies and radio loud quasars , as described by odea et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and summarized by daly ( 2011 ) .",
    "the beam powers for these sources are not affected by doppler beaming and boosting due to bulk motion ; the sources are large , typically much larger than the host galaxy , and the radio emission is emitted isotropically .",
    "beam powers are obtained by applying the equations of strong shock physics using parameters empirically determined from the multi - frequency radio maps .",
    "one parameter is the source age , which is determined with a spectral aging analysis .",
    "a significant amount of work has shown that these ages provide reasonable estimates for very powerful frii sources like those included here , and uncertainties in the spectral aging analysis are included in uncertainties of parameters determined using the analysis , as summarized by odea et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and references therein , though there may be some caveats as discussed , for example , by eilek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , blundell & rawlings ( 2000 ) , and hardcastle ( 2013 ) .",
    "thus , the parent population begins with classical double radio sources with beam powers that have been determined .",

    "( 2012 ) are included . of these sources , those with a reliable estimate of accretion disk luminosity",
    "were identified ; the [ oiii ] luminosity of the source was used to determine the bolometric luminosity of the accretion disk using the well - known relation @xmath0 ( e.g. heckman et al .",

    "2014 ) . using the tables published by grimes , rawlings , & willott ( 2004 ) , this led to a sample of 55 high excitation radio galaxies ( herg ) , 13 low excitation radio galaxies ( lerg ) , and 29 radio loud quasars ( rlq ) .",

    "the ratio of the beam power to the accretion disk luminosity is a fundamental physical variable that parameterizes the strength of the outflow relative to the accretion disk .",
    "this ratio is shown in fig . 1 as a function of the accretion disk luminosity normalized by the eddington luminosity , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath10 .",

    "the ratio of @xmath17 is @xmath18 for all sources ; @xmath19 for herg ; @xmath20 for lerg ; and @xmath21 for rlq .",

    "these fits suggest that @xmath22 with @xmath23 provides a good description of the data , with the possible exception of the lerg data .",
    "the impact of using @xmath24 is discussed below .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the accretion disk luminosity as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the black hole mass , @xmath27 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath28 is the dimensionless mass accretion rate , @xmath29 is the eddington accretion rate , and @xmath30 is a dimensionless efficiency factor .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the beam power as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a function of the spin of the black hole . to determine the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ,",

    "requires that constants of proportionality be obtained for @xmath51 and @xmath47 .",
    "this may be done by parameterizing the maximum possible emission in terms of the eddington luminosity , so the maximum possible value of @xmath51 is @xmath52 and that for @xmath47 is @xmath53 . assuming the maximum values are reached when @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and absorbing all constants of proportionality into the coefficients yields @xmath56 @xmath57 here @xmath58 and @xmath59 are in units of @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the maximum possible value of the function @xmath32 , which is typically obtained when the dimensionless spin @xmath62 ; here @xmath63 ( sometimes denoted @xmath33 or @xmath64 ) is defined in the usual way , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the spin angular momentum of the hole .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , and using the relationship @xmath67 indicated above , we obtain @xmath68 independent of the value of @xmath33 , and thus independent of specific outflow models .     and @xmath69 .",
    ", width=302 ]    if this analysis is carried out for the specific value of @xmath70 obtained for all sources , @xmath71 , then eq .",
    "( 4 ) becomes @xmath72 which is also independent of @xmath33 , and is very similar to eq .",
    "empirical results for @xmath73 obtained using eq .",
    "( 4 ) with @xmath74 and @xmath75 are shown in fig . 3 and listed in table 1",
    ". the square root of the function is shown because in many models this is a good first order approximation to the spin of the hole .",
    "estimates of black hole spins can be obtained from @xmath73 in the context of specific models .",
    "changing the normalizations @xmath76 and @xmath77 will cause the values of @xmath78 to shift .",
    "however , only small upward shifts are allowed by the data .",
    "this follows because , empirically ( e.g. see fig .",
    "4 ) , @xmath76 must be close to one , and certainly can not be much less than one , and @xmath79 . and , as the value of @xmath77 decreases , @xmath78 increases . requiring that the largest values of @xmath78 remain less than or equal to one indicates that @xmath77 should be greater than about 0.4 , consistent with the empirical results illustrated in fig .",
    "thus , the true value of @xmath78 is only allowed to float between the value obtained here , and the current value divided by about 0.4 .",
    "if a particular outflow model is specified , the value of @xmath63 may be obtained .",
    "for example , in one representation of the generalized blandford - znajek ( bz ) model @xmath80 ( e.g. blandford & znajek 1977 ; tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "2010 ; yuan & narayan 2014 ) .",
    "values of @xmath63 obtained in this model are shown fig .",
    "5 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "there is a clear separation of sources in terms of the ratio of beam power to disk luminosity ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . lerg sources tend to have the highest ratio of beam power to disk luminosity , with some sources having a beam power comparable to or even larger than the disk luminosity .",
    "rlq tend to have a low ratio , with most sources having a beam power less than about 10 % the disk luminosity .",
    "herg tend to span the full range of values of this ratio .",
    "the relationship between this ratio and the eddington normalized disk luminosity is statistically significant after accounting for the dependence of these quantities on redshift for the herg , rlq , all sources combined , but not for the lerg sources",
    ".        solutions that are consistent with the data may be compared with theoretical expectations . in the generalized bz model ,",
    "the equation for beam power is @xmath81 ( e.g. blandford & znajek 1977 ; blandford 1990 ; tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "2010 ) . for adaf and mad accretion disks ,",
    "the magnetic field strength depends on multiple parameters including @xmath82 and @xmath26 ; the dependence of the field on these parameters is @xmath83 ( e.g. yuan & narayan 2014 ) or @xmath84 , indicating that @xmath43 ; @xmath85 is the field strength in units of @xmath86 g. interestingly , this theoretical equation for the beam power is identical to the empirical relation indicated by the first solution discussed in section 3 .",
    "thus , the generalized bz model with an adaf or mad accretion disk is consistent with the empirically motivated relationships between the beam power , disk luminosity , and eddington luminosity discussed in section 3 , perhaps suggesting that this is in fact the correct model , or close to the correct model . in this context",
    ", the first solution along with the normalization given by equation ( 3 ) allows a determination of the coefficient @xmath87 that describes the field strength . obtaining the normalization @xmath88 from tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which is nearly identical to that obtained by daly ( 2009 ) with @xmath89 replaced by @xmath32 , we obtain @xmath90 .",
    "this is similar to the value expected in the mad model of about @xmath91 ( e.g. yuan & narayan 2014 ) accounting for their different definition of @xmath92 .",
    "note that to be consistent with this representation of @xmath47 , we require @xmath93 . theoretical representations of @xmath47 and @xmath51 should be consistent with the empirical relation indicated by eq .",
    "the spin function @xmath78 may be obtained independent of specific outflow models ; this quantity is expected to provide a good first order estimate of black hole spin .",
    "a broad range of values of @xmath73 is obtained ( see fig .",
    "the values and range of values of @xmath73 are similar for all three types of sources studied ; sources do not separate out according to this quantity .",
    "this suggests that spin is not related to agn type for frii herg and rlq , and possibly also for lerg .",
    "finally , even though @xmath73 depends upon the values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , it is argued in section 3 that only small upward shifts of this quantity are allowed by the data . at this point ,",
    "the data are not sufficient to be able to distinguish between chaotic accretion and non - chaotic accretion for the sources studied ; both are consistent with the results obtained here . further studies of this type with larger numbers of sources may be able to distinguish between these accretion scenarios .
