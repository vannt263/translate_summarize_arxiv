    "but the two pattern are becoming different above @xmath139.,width=347 ]    thus if we increase @xmath16 with fixed @xmath106 , the energy @xmath10 also increases to get away from the potential well and lie on the above @xmath109 at some threshold value , which makes un - trapped states .",
    "after that , as @xmath0 is getting larger , the bottom of potential well goes downward respect to the state of energy @xmath10 .",
    "it means that the scattering state is growing apart from the bottom of potential well .",
    "consequently , the lamb shift @xmath51 increases . in our result ,",
    "the threshold value of @xmath16 is 3 which shows transition at @xmath128 . in other words , in the above - barrier resonances , when @xmath0 decreases , the bottom of potential well goes up toward the state of energy @xmath10 to result in diminishing @xmath51 .    in fig .",
    "[ figure-7 ] , there are eigenvalues of @xmath116 , @xmath72 , and bottom of the potential well @xmath140 simultaneously depending on refractive index @xmath0 .",
    "it shows that @xmath140 is getting deeper and @xmath108 decreases , when @xmath0 increases .",
    "the degree of variation of @xmath116 is getting larger as @xmath16 increases . on the contrary , in ( b ) , that of @xmath72 is changing from exponential decay to almost linear decay , which means that the degree of variation is drastically reduced .",
    "these two facts imply that quality factor @xmath47 can be also changeable .",
    "so , let us investigate ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ figure-8 ] . in order to grasp the relation between @xmath51 and @xmath47",
    ", we get the value of inverse quality factor instead of quality factor itself .",
    "thereby , we can get quite similar variation pattern of @xmath51 and @xmath47 in ( @xmath141 ) with @xmath106 for the below - barrier resonances .",
    "this fact is important because the trapped states are usually using lasing mode in experiment . by the way , the two pattern are becoming very much different above @xmath139 .",
    "since this inverse quality factor is wiggling around at the boundary point @xmath127 , it may suggest that the boundary points might be related to the inflection point of inverse quality factor .",
    "we have studied the open nature of dielectric microcavities by comparing the differences between normal modes and quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) .",
    "the former ones have always real eigenvalues and are defined in solely interior of cavity . on the other hand , the qnms are defined on the total space comprised of two functions , i.e. , @xmath142 .",
    "the first one is an eigenfunction of @xmath58 whose eigenvalues are generally complex number which is defined entirely on subsystem @xmath18 and latter one is a resonance tail defined solely on subsystem @xmath19 , and we find out that the real eigenvalues of normal modes are little bit greater than those of the dielectric cavity .",
    "furthremore , we have investigated the lamb shift ( energy shift due to coupling with the environment ) in two circumstances .",
    "first , we have found the relation between the angular quantum number @xmath17 and the lamb shift @xmath51 .",
    "we showed that the lamb shift decreases as @xmath17 increases at least in wgms .",
    "second , we have investigated the relation between the refractive index @xmath0 and the lamb shift using effective potential well .",
    "there are two kinds of variations in lamb shifts with respect to @xmath98 . in the below - barrier resonances",
    ", @xmath51 decreases as @xmath0 increases . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath51 increases as @xmath0 increases in the above - barrier resonances .",
    "moreover , the effective potential well is quite generic in physics so that our methodology might be useful for other fields such as atomic physics and nuclear physics .",
    "we hope that our results can give some clues to understanding of the openness effects such as quasi - scar or goos - hnchen shift .",
