    "the hyperfine splitting becomes comparable to the zeeman splitting even for weak magnetic fields , and we quickly enter the paschen - back regime of field strengths ( level crossing of the @xmath8-states belonging to different @xmath3-states ) , in which the formulation presented in p1 is not valid . since the paschen - back effect is outside the scope of the present paper , our treatment here is limited to the non - magnetic case , but the extension to the paschen - back regime is planned to be pursued in future work .",
