    "despite the detection of large columns of neutral hydrogen in the early universe , through the known 1500 damped lyman-@xmath7 absorbers ( dlas , see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "( see @xcite ) . in absorption",
    "however , the strength of the line only depends upon the column density and the flux of the continuum source , allowing this to be detected to much higher redshift . ]",
    "detection of this at high redshift is of particular importance since this transition traces the cool component of the neutral gas , the reservoir for star formation , whereas the lyman-  transition traces all of the neutral gas .",
    "the paucity of redshifted 21-cm absorption to date can largely be attributed to the low fraction of background sources with sufficient radio flux ( @xmath9 jy ) , the narrow bandwidths free of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , as well as the limited frequency coverage of current radio telescopes . of the detections ,",
    "half are due to absorbers _ intervening _ the sight - lines to more distant radio sources ( see @xcite and references therein ) , with the other half being _ associated _ with the gas in the host galaxy of the source itself ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , both types of absorber are subject to additional selection effects , increasing the difficulty of detection at high redshift :    * for the intervening absorbers , the majority of detections occur at redshifts of @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) and for those known to contain large columns of neutral hydrogen ( the dlas ) , the detection rate at @xmath11 is only a third that at @xmath10 ( 60% , cf .",
    "this is believed to be due to the geometry effects introduced by an expanding universe , where high redshift absorbers are always disadvantaged in how effectively they intercept the background emission @xcite .",
    "* for the associated absorbers , at lower redshifts ( @xmath12 ) there is a @xmath13 probability of a detection , depending on whether the large - scale gas disk intercepts the line - of - sight to the radio source @xcite .",
    "however , at higher redshifts the probability of a detection falls drastically .",
    "this is believed to be due to the traditional optical selection of targets , where the availability of a redshift biases towards the most ultra - violet luminous sources @xcite . for most of the radio sources known at these large luminosity distances",
    "all of the neutral gas is probably ionised @xcite .",
    "this highlights a major difference between the two types of absorber : while there are equally few detections of 21-cm in intervening systems , all of these are known or suspected  , the lyman-  transition can only be detected by ground - based telescopes at redshifts of @xmath14 . at @xmath15 , the mgii @xmath16   equivalent width may be used infer the presence of a dla @xcite and perhaps even to estimate the total hydrogen column density @xcite . ] to contain large columns of neutral hydrogen and , where searched , 21-cm detection rates are high @xcite . however , within the high redshift radio sources themselves , the neutral gas may be truly absent ( the `` uv interpretation '' , @xcite ) and until a population of 21-cm absorbing galaxies is found , this material , the reservoir for star formation , may be regarded as `` missing '' .",
    "finding these missing systems is of utmost importance in quantifying the number of gas - rich galaxies which exist below the detection thresholds of optical spectroscopy . based upon the uv interpretation",
    ", we therefore suggest that high redshift surveys should be directed towards the most optically dim radio sources , where the faint magnitudes indicate that the ultra - violet luminosity of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is below the critical ionising continuum luminosity of @xmath3 , above which associated 21-cm absorption has never been detected ( @xcite).m continuum emission . ]      ideally , we would like to search for associated 21-cm absorption at redshifts of @xmath17 , the regime of the original exclusive non - detections which alerted us to the critical luminosity @xcite and where there is currently only one detection ( at @xmath18 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , our usual source catalogues , the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs , @xcite ) and quarter - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( pqfs , @xcite ) , yield only two sources with suitably faint blue magnitudes ( @xmath19 , cf .",
    "[ b - z ] ) in the 90-cm band ( @xmath20 ) , both of which have been previously searched ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the remaining catalogues of radio sources , which have both magnitudes and redshifts available @xcite , yield only ultra - steep spectrum sources in the 305360 mhz band ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the steep radio spectra may indicate very extended emission , minimising the covering factor , @xmath22 , of the neutral gas , possibly a cause of the exclusive non - detections of @xmath23  sources at these redshifts @xcite .    in order to bypass these issues ,",
    "we are forced to probe lower redshifts ( @xmath0 ) , where 21-cm is redshifted into the 610 mhz band of the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . in order to avoid steep spectrum sources",
    ", we have therefore prioritised the faintest objects mostly from the phfs and pqfs , where the blue magnitudes of @xmath24 indicate luminosities of @xmath25  at these redshifts ( fig .",
    "[ b - z ] ) .",
    "these catalogues , by definition , comprise of sources with flat spectra over 2.75.0 ghz , although in order to obtain a sample of ten , a few were added from the other radio catalogues ( see table  [ obs ] ) , with the priority of @xmath24 and a flux density in excess of 0.1  jy , meaning that a target with a flat spectrum or a clear turnover frequency could not always be included . from a survey of these ten objects ,",
    "we report the third highest redshift detection of associated 21-cm absorption to date ( at @xmath4 in sdssj154508.52 + 475154.6 ) , as well as eight upper limits and one source lost to rfi , which we present and discuss here .",
    "each of the sources was observed on 2224 january 2012 with the gmrt full 30 antenna array , using the 610 mhz receiver backed with the fx correlator over a bandwidth of 16 mhz .",
    "this was spread over 512 channels in orthogonal circular polarisations , giving a channel spacing of @xmath26 .",
    "this is sufficient to spectrally resolve all of the associated 21-cm absorbers currently known ( which range from 18 to 475 , @xcite ) , while maintaining a redshift coverage of @xmath27 , in order to cover any uncertainties in the optical redshifts of the targets .",
    "each source was observed for a total of two hours with the aim of reaching a @xmath28 optical depth limit of @xmath29 per channel , or a sensitivity to @xmath30 , which is close to the lower limit for the published 21-cm searches .    for each source , 3c48 , 3c147 and 3c286",

    "in the third in a series of surveys ( following @xcite ) for redshifted  21-cm in the hosts of radio galaxies and quasars , we have searched ten , mostly flat spectrum , objects at redshifts of @xmath0 . this corresponds to look - back times of @xmath44 gyr , which is a range relatively unprobed by previous surveys for associated  21-cm .",
    "this has resulted in one detection , which at @xmath45 , after 4c+05.19 ( @xmath46 , @xcite ) and b20902 + 34 ( @xmath47 , @xcite ) , is the third highest redshift detection of associated 21-cm absorption .",

    "although uncertain , this is consistent with the 40% rate generally found for those below the critical value ( or luminosities of @xmath6 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to our previous survey of @xmath11 sources , for which there were no detections .",
    "these sources did , however , have much steeper spectra than the current sample , which may suggest that ineffective coverage of the background emission could have contributed to the zero detection rate .    despite our deliberate selection of optically faint sources ,",
    "the one detection highlights the difficulties in searching for highly redshifted associated 21-cm absorption , where the selection of the necessarily faint objects introduces a bias towards objects for which the optical redshifts are poorly determined .",

    "for these the critical luminosity will be correspondingly lower @xcite , requiring the selection of even fainter optical sources in order to detect associated 21-cm absorption .",
    "thus , through their wide fields - of - view and bandwidths , making them unreliant on optical redshifts , the next generation of radio telescopes ( the square kilometre array and its pathfinders ) will be ideal in finding the neutral gas currently missing in the hosts of high redshift radio sources .",
