    "homogeneous bubble nucleation ( cavitation ) has attracted much attention for many years from a fundamental point of view as well as for technological interests .",
    "it occurs when a fluid is undersaturated and is held at a pressure lower than its coexisting vapor pressure at a given temperature .",
    "then the fluid is said to be stretched .",
    "homogeneous bubble nucleation occurs in the stretched liquid .",
    "homogeneous nucleation including homogeneous bubble nucleation in the liquid  @xcite as well as liquid droplet condensation@xcite or the crystallization  @xcite from melts or glass in general is the basic mechanism to initiate the first - order phase transition , and has been studied for many years mainly using a very simple analytical theory called classical nucleation theory ( cnt )  @xcite .",
    "recently , due to the development of the density functional theory  @xcite the deviations from the cnt has been predicted using various model systems .",
    "these predictions have successfully explained the deviation of the experimental data from the cnt predictions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a reliable yet handy empirical formula which can predict nucleation rates is highly desired . to this end , various empirical formulae for bubble and droplet nucleation in a fluid  @xcite as well as crystal nucleation in melts  @xcite have been proposed .",
    "the central quantities of the nucleation phenomena is the nucleation rate @xmath3 , which is the number of critical nuclei formed per unit time per unit volume .",
    "usually it is written in arrhenius form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a kinetic pre - exponential factor which is believed to be weakly dependent on temperature @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the boltzmann s constant , and @xmath8 is the reversible work of formation of the critical bubble .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the nucleation rate is controlled by the work of formation @xmath8 , which most of the theoretical works study .",
    "the density functional theory is a powerful tool to study the density profile and the work of formation @xmath8 of critical nucleus .",
    "for example , oxtoby and evans  @xcite has studied the work of formation @xmath8 and the density profile of critical droplets and bubbles of the yukawa fluid using the so - called non - local density functional theory .",
    "zeng and oxtoby  @xcite studied the critical nucleus of the lennard - jones fluid using the non - local density functional theory .",
    "the present author  @xcite used the local square - gradient density functional theory  @xcite combined with the double - parabolic free energy , and demonstrated that the results of oxtoby and coworkers  @xcite can be reproducible by the square - gradient density functional theory rather than fully non - local theory .",
    "a similar model with triple - parabolic free energy is used later by barrett  @xcite . very recently , li and wilemsky  @xcite has compared the results obtained from the accurate non - local density functional theory with that from the approximate square - gradient theory and found that the two results agree qualitatively well .    among various nucleation processes ,",
    "bubble nucleation has attracted relatively little attention  @xcite .",
    "recently , shen and debenedetti  @xcite studied homogeneous bubble nucleation in a stretched lennard - jones fluid using the non - local density functional theory of zeng and oxtoby  @xcite .",
    "they found that if scaled by appropriate quantities , various quantities of the critical bubble including the work of formation @xmath8 degenerate into universal curves when they are plotted against the scaled undersaturation @xmath0 .",
    "their results justify various empirical scaling approach  @xcite to the nucleation rate .",
    "similar density functional calculations have been conducted by kusaka not only for the lennard - jones fluid but for the square - well fluid .",
    "they found that the scaling is modelatedly successfull for those two fluid systems .",

    "all those studies mentioned above are based on the numerical results for several specific models of simple fluids .",
    "however , since the nucleation is so general and ubiquitous phenomena not restricted to simple fluid that it is highly desirable to study the scaling rule in more general models which can be applied not only to the simple liquid but to complex fluids , or even to amorphous or liquid metals .    in this paper , we will use a simple square - gradient density functional theory with a triple - parabolic free energy proposed by grnsy and oxtoby  @xcite to study the various properties of the critical bubble of homogeneous bubble nucleation .",
    "we choose this model as it captures the most basic properties of nucleation , yet many physical quantities can be handled analytically . in this study",
    "we particularly focus on the scaling rule of various quantities  @xcite . in section",
    "ii we present a short review of the square - gradient density - functional model with triple - parabolic free energy  @xcite to summarize the necessary formula .",
    "we also correct a few typographical errors in the original article  @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we will present the numerical results and discuss the implication of the results in light of the scaling rule .",
    "finally section iv is devoted to the concluding summation .",
    "in the square - gradient density - functional model of the fluid  @xcite , the free energy of the inhomogeneous fluid , such as the critical bubble in the stretched liquid is written as @xmath9 this form of the free energy is also known as the cahn - hilliard model  @xcite or the phase - field model  @xcite . in the triple - parabola model of grnsy and oxtoby  @xcite , the local part of the free energy @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 which consists of three parabola centered at the vapor density @xmath12 , and at the free energy barrier @xmath13 ( spinodal ) , and at the liquid density @xmath14 , which we call `` vapor '' , `` spinodal '' and `` liquid '' part of the free energy .",
    "we have chosen this triple - parabolic model  @xcite rather than a simpler double - parabolic model  @xcite as the former seems more realistic near the spinodal point .",
    "although grnsy and oxtoby  @xcite set @xmath15 and @xmath16 to simplify the various formulae , we will leave two quantities finite as we want to consider the vapor phase with finite density @xmath12 .",
    "the curvature of parabola @xmath17 and @xmath18 are related to the compressibility of vapor and liquid phases , and @xmath1 is the free energy difference between the liquid and the vapor .",
    "although @xmath1 represents in fact the pressure difference @xmath19 as eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is the grand potential of open system  @xcite , we call @xmath1 chemical potential to make the comparison to the previous work  @xcite easier since @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath1 through @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the number density of the liquid  @xcite",
    ". we use the terminology `` over - saturation '' when @xmath1 is positive and `` undersaturation '' when @xmath1 is negative .",
    "the stretched liquid in this study corresponds to the under - saturated liquid .",
    "therefore we will be mainly concerned with the situation when @xmath22 .    from the continuity of the free energy @xmath23 at the boundary @xmath24 and @xmath25 , they are given by @xmath26    in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) @xmath27 is the barrier height which separates the vapor at @xmath12 from the liquid at @xmath14 , and is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 are constants determined from the compressibility @xmath30 . by equating two formulae for @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) , we obtain the location @xmath13 of the free energy barrier @xmath31 which depends on the over - saturation @xmath32 for the oversaturated vapor and the undersaturation @xmath22 for the stretched liquid .",

    "this is realized when @xmath33 , which leads to the over - saturation for the gas spinodal @xmath34 similarly the liquid spinodal occurs when the undersaturation is given by @xmath35 for the stretched liquid .",
    "since we are interested in the critical bubble formation in the stretched fluid , we will consider the region from coexistence @xmath36 to the liquid spinodal @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast to the previous models  @xcite where the compressibility diverges continuously as the spinodal is approached , the compressibility remains finite until the spinodal point is reached in our triple - parabolic model as the curvature @xmath17 and @xmath18 is fixed .    ) .",

    "the radii @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the matching radius that satisfies @xmath43 and @xmath44 . since the free energy consists of three parabolas corresponding to the vapor , spinodal and liquid parts , the density profile of the critical bubble consists of three parts that correspond to the three parts of free energy when @xmath38 near the coexistence . however , as the undersaturation increases ( @xmath45 becomes large ) and it approaches the liquid spinodal @xmath2 , the density profile consists of only the two parts correspond to the spinodal and the liquid parts .",
    "we use the terminology `` cnt regime '' for the former regime where the classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) is expected to be qualitatively correct , and `` spinodal regime '' for the latter where the spinodal nucleation  @xcite is expected to occur .",

    "( [ eq:19 ] ) and ( [ eq:21 ] ) compared with the classical work of formation eq.([eq:23 ] ) .",
    "our square - gradient density - functional model correctly predicts that the work of formation vanishes at the spinodal while the classical work remains finite at the spinodal .",
    "the scaled work of formation @xmath122 barely shows scaling properties @xmath123 proposed by talanquer  @xcite and shen and debenedeti  @xcite in contrast to the results for the lennard - jones fluid  @xcite .",
    "the shape changes from convex up for the case - i , which is similar to previous work  @xcite for the lennard - jones and the square - well fluids , to the convex down for the case - iii , which is simlar to the results by mller _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the density fucntional culculation of bubble nucleation in the polymer mixture .",
    "therefore , the various scaling rules  @xcite for the work of formation could depend strongly on the model the authors has chosen .",
    "then the scaling rule , such as eq .",
    "( [ eq:35 ] ) may not always be valid for any model or any physical systems . a similar modest scaling to ours",
    "was found by kusaka  @xcite .",
    "although we do not obtain anomalous structural properties of the critical bubble near the spinodal , the work of formation of the critical bubble correctly vanishes at the spinodal .",
    "therefore anomalous spinodal nucleation  @xcite should occur even within our model as soon as the work of formation is of the order of the thermal energy @xmath124 .",
    "in this study , we use a square - gradient density - functional model with triple - parabolic free energy , to study the various properties of the critical bubble of homogeneous bubble nucleation .",
    "in particular , we pay attention to the scaling properties of the reversible work of formation of critical bubble as well as other quantities such as the density at the center of critical bubble or the interfacial thickness .",
    "in contrast to the similar density - functional study of shen and debenedetti  @xcite who have found that not only the work of formation but other various quantities related to the critical bubble shows scaling rule , we found marginal scaling relation for our model . since our model is specified only by the compressibility and the undersaturation , our result seems to indicate that the liquid compressibility changes concomitantly with the vapor compressibility as the temperature is changed in the lennard - jones fluid , which would lead to the scaling rule found by shen and debenedetti  @xcite for different temperatures .",
    "furthermore , we found that the structural anomalies of the critical bubble near the spinodal found in the @xmath92-field theory@xcite does not exist .",
    "specifically we did not find anomalous minimum in the density at the center of critical bubble found by shen and debenedetti@xcite for the lennard - jones fluid when the undersaturation is increased toward the spinodal .",
    "they  @xcite attributed this anomaly due to the spinodal nucleation .",
    "we also found that the interfacial thickness of the critical bubble in the spinodal regime does not diverge near the spinodal as unger and klein  @xcite predicted .",
    "in contrast , the thickness remains constant up to the spinodal .",
    "furthermore , the interfacial profile remains the same in the spinodal regime as we scale the profile .",
    "therefore a part of the anomalous behavior of various quantities near the spinodal predicted by various authors using various different models could be largely model - dependent .",
    "such anomalies and their extent could partly be due to the mathematical structure of @xmath92-field or the lennard - jones fluid .",
    "further theoretical study to test the scaling properties of the critical nucleus and bubble , in particular near the spinodal using other realistic models will be certainly necessary .",
    "the critical cavity  @xcite in the stretched fluid can also be studied using this square - gradient density - functional model with triple - parabolic free energy .",
    "finally , the dynamics of the bubble formation will also be interesting , for that purpose numerically efficient cell dynamics system  @xcite could be used .",
