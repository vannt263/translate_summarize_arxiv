    "an important insight in the study of quantum many - body systems is related to the observation that common states that naturally occur do not quite exhaust the entire hilbert space available to them , but instead a much smaller subspace .",
    "this insight is at the heart of powerful numerical methods that have been devised in recent years .",
    "ideas such as the density - matrix renormalization group approach , and new ideas that allow for the simulation of higher - dimensional quantum lattice models @xcite , work exactly because they model well quantum states that in a certain sense have little entanglement .",
    "more precisely , the states which are tractible by these approaches satisfy what is called an _ area law _",
    "@xcite , so the entropy of a subregion scales at most as the boundary area of that region ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for practical purposes , and in particular for 1d systems , these methods in particular give accurate accounts of ground state properties .",
    "now , not all ground states of local quantum lattice models can be efficiently approximated .",
    "this holds even true for 1d chains : indeed , one can construct models for which approximating the ground state energy is provably -hard @xcite  albeit using a fairly sophisticated construction involinvg large local dimensions  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of these constructions is that the difficulty of their solution appears to be strongly related to whether the system is _ frustrated _ or not .",
    "this suggests that whether or not the system is frustrated is another criterion for whether a quantum lattice model should be considered `` easy '' or `` hard '' , in addition to its ground states having `` a lot '' or `` little '' entanglement .",
    "this intuition that frustrated systems should be hard to simulate is indeed true for classical systems , where the frustrated or glassy models are the hard ones to describe . for quantum systems , there is evidence that the situation should be more complex @xcite .    in this work , we explore a class of models where the intuition of frustration - free models being _ easy to solve _ holds true . building upon work in ref .",

    "@xcite , for a natural class of two - local hamiltonians acting on spin-@xmath1 particles ( simply `` spins '' henceforth ) , we show that ground states can be reduced to a completely characterized and low - dimensional subspace , and then re - constructed by identifying the ground state - space of each interaction of the hamiltonian term - by - term .",
    "specifically , the ground space is the image of a symmetric subspace under an explicitly constructible , and efficiently contractible , tensor network .",
    "it follows that the ground states satisfy an area law , and hence contain little entanglement in the above sense .",
    "this generalizes recent results regarding the _ existence _ of states which have little entanglement in the ground - state manifolds of such hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "we discuss how to efficiently simulate the ground state manifold , and suggest how this could be used to simulate `` almost '' frustration - free quantum lattice models .",
    "we consider _ spin-@xmath1 hamiltonians on a lattice_. the lattice is described by some graph , the vertex set of which we denote by @xmath2 . naturally , the hamiltonian will be local , or more specifically include only nearest - neighbor interaction terms .",

    ". an important class of hamiltonians are those which are _ frustration - free _ ( or _ unfrustrated _ ) , for which each ground state vector @xmath6 is also a ground state of the individual coupling terms : i.e. for which @xmath7 holds for all @xmath4 and all @xmath8 .",
    "the actual ground state @xmath9 is the maximally mixed state over @xmath5 , and so is mixed unless the ground state manifold @xmath5 is non - degenerate .",
    "our main results pertain to frustration - free spin hamiltonians as above , with the further constraint that each term @xmath4 has at least one entangled excited state . in ,",
    "we show that the ground states @xmath9 of such hamiltonians satisfy an area law @xcite : that is , for a contiguous region of spins @xmath10 , the _ entanglement of formation_. if the ground state is non - degenerate and hence pure , the entanglement of formation is nothing but the usual entanglement entropy . of the ground state satisfies @xmath11 for @xmath12 constant , where @xmath13 is the `` boundary area '' ( i.e. the number of edges in the interaction graph of @xmath14 , which are incident to both @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) : see .",
    "the _ entanglement of formation _ is the largest asymptotically continuous entanglement monotone , so this also implies an entanglement area law for e.g. the _",
    "distillable entanglement_. thus , ground states of frustration - free hamiltonians contain little entanglement .",
    "of a distinguished region @xmath15 in some lattice , here a cubic lattice , with tighter bounds for special cases.[area ] ]    this follows as a consequence of the fact that the ground - state manifold is the image of the symmetric subspace on @xmath17 spins ( for some @xmath17 bounded above by the number of spins of the hamiltonian ) under an efficiently simulatable , and explicitly constructible , tree - tensor network .",
    "we show this in , in which we demonstrate how this allows us to efficiently simulate the ground space of the spin models we consider . for the cases where we have a tree tensor network with a single top root",

    "this problem is efficiently solvable  @xcite ; in contrast , the similar problem 3-sat ( in which constraints apply to triples of variables ) is -complete  @xcite . in 2sat , individual clauses on boolean variables are replaced by projectors @xmath19 with @xmath20 on pairs of spins : an instance of 2sat  is _ satisfiable _ if there is a vector which is a zero eigenvector of each projector simultaneously .",
    "for an instance of 2sat , determining whether there exist such simultaneous zero eigenvectors is equivalent to determining whether the hamiltonian obtained by summing the projectors is unfrustrated .",
    "conversely , the problem of determining when a @xmath21-local spin hamiltonian @xmath14 is frustration - free may be reduced to 2sat , by rescaling the terms of the hamiltonian @xmath14 so that each term @xmath4 has a minimal eigenvalue of @xmath22 , and replacing each rescaled term @xmath4 with the projector @xmath19 onto @xmath23 . by construction ,",
    "such a substituation does not affect the ground space of the terms .",
    "thus , solving 2sat  is equivalent to determining whether a @xmath21-local spin hamiltonian is frustration - free .",
