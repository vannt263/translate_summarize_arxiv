    "<S> the experimentalists have reported the following measurements  @xcite : @xmath16 at @xmath17 probability , while the upper bounds at @xmath18 probability are given as : @xmath19 on the theoretical side , since these decay modes are absent from any annihilation diagram contribution , calculations of hadronic matrix elements are quite reliable , and these decays have been analyzed in the sm by different groups @xcite . in the sm , these channels are highly suppressed for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> at the quark level , these decays proceed via @xmath20 , which is a flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process . </S>",
    "<S> the fcnc transition is induced by the loop effects and the relevant wilson coefficients are very small . </S>",

    "<S> the physics above the scale @xmath32 in the @xmath15 meson weak decays have been incorporated into the wilson coefficients of the effective hamiltonian and the task left is to evaluate the matrix element of each four - quark operator . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest way is to decompose it into two simpler parts : one is the decay constant of the emitted meson ; the other part is the @xmath15-to - light form factor which only contains one light meson in the final state . both of these two parts can be directly extracted from the experimental data , or evaluated from some nonperturbative method such as the lattice qcd and qcd sum rules . in this approach , often referred as the naive factorization@xcite , the decay amplitudes can be written as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the wilson coefficient combination as defined in ref.@xcite . in the naive factorization , </S>",

    "<S> branching ratios are obtained as : @xmath56 compared with results in the naive factorization approach , we find that the branching ratios are enhanced by a factor of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that our results are larger than those evaluated in the qcdf approach in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that we have chosen the factorization scale for the hard - spectator diagram as @xmath58 gev . </S>",
