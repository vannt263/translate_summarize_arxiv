    "with the discovery of an apparent separation between the classical and quantum classifications of computational complexity@xcite , and of fault - tolerant schemes for quantum computation@xcite , quantum information theory plays an important role in computer science . in 1994 , shor@xciteintroduced the quantum factoring algorithm , which achieves an exponential speed - up relative to classical algorithms .",
    "shor s crucial insight was that the discrete fourier transformation(dft ) can be evaluated in polynomial time on a quantum computer . in order to realize shor s algorithm ,",
    "performing dft becomes most important . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a version to realize dft by using nmr spectrometer and simulator and give our experiment and simulation results realizing two qubit dft .",
    "the discrete fourier transformation modulo@xmath1(dft@xmath2 ) is a unitary transformation in @xmath1-dimension(@xmath3 ) .",
    "it is defined relative to chosen basis @xmath4 by@xcite :    dft@xmath5 @xmath6    coppersmith@xcite suggested the efficient algorithm for dft on application of quantum mechanical operators and gave an improvement in which evaluation of @xmath0 bit fourier transformation is accomplished by composing @xmath0 one - qubit operations and @xmath7 two - qubit operations .",
    "so the implementation of dft is based on realizing one - qubit operator @xmath8 which acts on the state of the @xmath9-qubit and two - qubit operator @xmath10 which acts on the states of qubit @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "the explicit form of the operator @xmath12 is@xcite :    @xmath13 @xmath14    @xmath15    the matrix representation of @xmath8 is : @xmath16    the explicit form of the operator @xmath10 is@xcite :    @xmath17 @xmath18     @xmath19    the matrix representation of @xmath10 is : @xmath20    transformation of @xmath10 affects only state @xmath21    we use a network to illustrate how to use operators @xmath8 and @xmath10 to compose @xmath22-qubit transformation in @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the operators corresponding to the network are :    @xmath25",
    "in this paper we realize dft by using nmr .",
    "the prime thing we should do is to perform @xmath8 and @xmath10 by using radiofrequency pulses and spin - spin interaction . using nmr to perform quantum computer",
    ", we should choose ax couple system .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system can be approximated as :    @xmath26 ( 4 )    we denote the rotation @xmath27 for a @xmath28 rotation about the @xmath29-axis and @xmath30 for a @xmath31 rotation about the @xmath32-axis , @xmath9 or @xmath11 means which nucleus is operated on , and @xmath33 is the time within which the system undergoes the unitary transformation @xmath34 in the doubly rotating frame .    to perform",
    "@xmath8 is actually to perform a walsh - hadamard transformation , which rotates each quantum qubit from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "the pulse sequences is@xcite : @xmath37    to perform @xmath38 we use radiofrequency pulses and spin - spin interaction like :    @xmath39    @xmath40    using the pulse sequences and spin - spin interaction we introduced above , we can implement dft to any quantum number with @xmath0-qubit in principle .",
    "in order to demonstrate the results described above , we have constructed an nmr quantum computer capable of implementing the dft . in this section , we give nmr experimental and nmr simulation results after doing dft on state @xmath41 by using the two radiofrequency pulse sequences corresponding to the operator @xmath8 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "data of the nmr experiment were taken at room temperature with a bruker arx-500 spectrometer and the signals were obtained with single - shot measurement . _  _    in the experiment we chose @xmath42 as our sample , labeled @xmath43 as @xmath44-qubit and @xmath45 as @xmath11-qubit .",
    "the observed j - coupling between @xmath45 and @xmath43 was @xmath46 first , we produced effective pure state @xmath47by using ",
    "temporal averaging@xcite .",
    "the pulses we used were@xcite :    _ e : none _    _ p1 : _ @xmath48    _ p2 : _",
    "@xmath49    since we wanted to perform dft on the state@xmath50 so after the preparation of the state @xmath51we should operate the pulse sequence : @xmath52 on @xmath45 to obtain the state@xmath53    second , we performed discrete fourier transformation on @xmath53 we list the pulses and spin - spin interaction are as follows :    @xmath54    the first two pulses and the last two pulses correspond to the operator @xmath12 and @xmath55 respectively , the rest pulses correspond to @xmath56 after these operations , the initial state@xmath57 was transformed into state :    @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60    compared with the definition of dft @xmath6 which means that after doing dft operation , the state@xmath57 should become    @xmath61 @xmath62    @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65    and the density matrix is : @xmath66@xmath67    the third step : we should reverse the qubit .",
    "that is , for example , for the case of three qubits , @xmath68 the third step is composed of three c - not operations , the network is shown in @xmath23 @xmath69 the radiofrequency pulses corresponding to the three c - not operators are :    \\1 . @xmath70    \\2 .",
    "@xmath71    \\3 .",
    "@xmath70    actually , the quantum - mechanical operation ",
    "reverse the qubit  is not applied . instead of this",
    ", one measures the state after dft and reads the result of the measurement in the opposite order@xcite .",
    "after these three steps , we had finished the operation of dft on the initial state @xmath57 . in order to illustrate the result we got",
    ", we need to obtain all the elements in the two - spin density matrix of the ultimate state by using state tomography@xcite . before we did the experiment ,",
    "we had simulated the experiment by using nmr simulator .",
    "the results are shown in @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 it can be regarded as a theoretical result .",
    "the matrix representation of the result is : @xmath75 which is the same as we expected .",
    "an advantage of doing nmr simulator is that it can represent the physics problem in spite of considering experimental errors ( chemical shift , the affection of environmental and so on ) .",
    "so using nmr simulator can be considered as a quantum computer to simulate some quantum mechanical problem .",
    "the experimental results are shown in @xmath72 @xmath76 , we measured and got real and imaginary components of the integral area from each peak , then we used all the integral areas we d got to reconstruct that density matrix .",
    "compared with the theoretical results , the experimental results agree with those deduced from theory .",
    "the relative errors are @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "they primarily due to the imperfect calibration of the rotation , and are also caused by inhomogeneity of the magnetic field or magnetization and least - squares fitting used in the tomography procedure . using other nmr techniques , such as phase cycling",
    ", the errors can be minimized .",
    "we have demonstrated that the discrete fourier transition can be implemented by means of nmr spectrometer and simulator and the experiment agrees with the theory well . using the method we introduced , we can perform dft on any quantum number with @xmath0-qubit .",
    "performing dft successfully gives a probability to realize shor s algorithm by using nmr .",
    "fourier analysis is a versatile tools in the laboratory@xcite , so we might expect that the fast dft should be an important application to physics .",
