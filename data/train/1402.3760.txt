    "dissipation has long been regarded as one major obstacle to developing any quantum technology in experiment . indeed , the quantum information , stored in certain quantum system , will be lost due to the inevitable interaction between quantum system and its surroundings .",
    "this fact has degraded many quantum entanglements and quantum logic operations relying on unitary dynamics , and impels people to explore efficient technologies to confront decoherence , such as quantum error correction @xcite , decoherence - free subspace @xcite , quantum controls @xcite , structured environments @xcite , classical environmental driving @xcite , suitable non - dissipative channels @xcite and so on . although there are some proposals on the production of noise - assisted entanglement @xcite , the entanglement is too small to be utilized . in 2009 , verstraete _ et al . _",
    "proposed a novel scheme for quantum computation and quantum - state engineering driven by dissipation @xcite , where the coupling to the environment drived the system to a target steady state .",
    "this work has shed new light on quantum information processing since it illustrates that the dissipation can be utilized as a resource to prepare entanglement and implement universal quantum computing . since then",
    ", the dissipation - based protocols have sprung up in various quantum information tasks @xcite .",
    "for instance , kastoryano _ et al_. prepared a maximally bipartite - entanglement state in a leaking optical cavity @xcite .",
    "dalla torre _",
    "et al_. realized the spin squeezing using quantum - bath engineering in a dissipative atom - cavity system @xcite .",
    "et al_. also prepared and protected a maximally entangled state of a pair of superconducting qubits in a low-@xmath3 cavity @xcite . compared with unitary - based scenarios ,",
    "the main advantage for adopting dissipation is that a stationary desired state can be achievable irrespective to the initial one .    among many physical carriers of qubit , neutral atoms are good candidates for quantum information processing because they possess stable hyperfine ground states fitting for encoding and any pairs of long - range atoms are coupled to each other via rydberg mediated interaction @xcite .",
    "as this interaction is strong enough to shift the atomic energy levels of highly excited rydberg states , the rydberg blockade occurs and the population of bi - excitation state is restrained . until now , the rydberg blockade has been successfully applied in quantum computation @xcite , preparation of entangled state @xcite , quantum algorithms @xcite , quantum simulators @xcite , and quantum repeaters @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we extend the recent work of carr and saffman @xcite to preparation of a three - dimensional entanglement of rydberg atoms .",
    "this kind of entangled state can enhance the violations of local realism and the security of quantum cryptography .",
    "the proposal makes full use of the unitary dynamics provided by rydberg interaction and the dissipative factor originating from the spontaneous emission of rydberg state .",
    "our result shows that both the target state negativity @xmath0 and fidelity @xmath4 can exceed 99.90% , which outperforms the schemes according to unitary dynamics @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first briefly review the advantage of the multi - dimensional entangled state over the two - dimensional entanglement in sec .",
    "we then derive the dissipative dynamics to prepare a three - dimensional entanglement in sec .",
    "iii , and quantify the three - dimensional entanglement via negativity and fidelity in sec .",
    "subsequently we apply this dissipative mechanism to creation of a three - atom singlet state in sec .",
    "v. this paper finally ends with a summary appearing in sec .",
    "before proceeding , we briefly review the advantage of the multi - dimensional entanglement .",
    "an arbitrary @xmath5-dimensional entanglement can be written in the following form @xcite @xmath6 and @xmath7 label two qudits , respectively and @xmath8 is the corresponding probability satisfying @xmath9 .",
    "this state is maximally entangled if @xmath10 .",
    "it has been proved in both theory and experiment that multi - dimensional entanglement can provide more security than two - dimensional entanglement offers . in the field of quantum key distribution for instance , the maximal admissible error rate is shown to increase by 53.48% from the two - dimensional entanglement based protocol @xmath11 to the three - dimensional entanglement based protocol 22.47% @xcite , and this value further increases with the dimensionality @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the multi - dimensional entanglement @xmath12 , acting as a quantum channel for high - dimensional quantum communication , quantum teleportation and other quantum information protocols , violates the local realism more strongly compared with the two - dimensional entanglement @xcite . therefore , the physical realization of multi - dimensional entanglement is at the request of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the system for dissipative preparation of the three - dimensional entanglement is illustrated in fig .",
    "we consider two cesium atoms , where the ground levels @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to hyperfine ground atomic levels @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 of @xmath19 manifold , and the three rydberg states @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 of @xmath23 . the transition from the ground states to the highly excited states are driven by three @xmath24 polarized lasers with rabi frequencies @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , detuning @xmath28 .",
    "the rydberg mediated interaction arises from the long - range van der waals interaction proportional to @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the distance between two rydberg atoms and @xmath31 depending on the quantum numbers of rydberg state @xcite .",
    "since the rydberg interaction energy depends on angular degrees of freedom , the coupling strength will be different when @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 belong to different zeeman sublevels @xcite .",
    "we here assume the rydberg interaction strengths satisfy @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 means the rydberg interaction strength when atoms are in the state @xmath38 . in a rotating frame ,",
    "the master equation describing the system s dynamics reads @xmath39+\\sum_{n=1,2}\\hat{\\cal l}_n\\hat{\\rho } \\hat{\\cal l}_n^{\\dag}-\\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{\\cal l}_n^{\\dag}\\hat{\\cal l}_n\\hat{\\rho}+\\hat{\\rho } \\hat{\\cal l}_n^{\\dag}\\hat{\\cal l}_n),\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the hamiltonian of system and @xmath41 is the lindblad operator describing the decay processes of @xmath42th atom by spontaneous emission of light . for simplicity",
    ", the excited states are assumed to spontaneously decay into three ground states with the same branching ratio @xmath43 . to avoid the population of other ground states via spontaneous emission",
    ", we may introduce @xmath44 manifold of cesium atom and apply a series of @xmath24 polarized lasers to recycle other ground states as the method adopted in ref  @xcite .",

    "the idea of dissipative preparation of three - dimensional entanglement can be generalized as follows : in the absence of microwave fields , the ground state @xmath49 will be firstly driven to the single - excitation subspace @xmath50 with detuning @xmath28 , then further excited to the bi - excitation @xmath38 with detuning @xmath51 .",
    "different from the usual rydberg interaction to block all bi - excitation states , here we set @xmath52 .",
    "this choice will result in a resonant coupling between the ground states and the bi - excitation rydberg state when both atoms are initially in different states ( @xmath53 ) , but an off - resonant interaction detuned by an amount of @xmath54 as both atoms are excited to the same state ( @xmath55 ) . thus combining with microwave driven fields and spontaneous emission from the rydberg levels",
    ", the system will be pumped into a stationary three - dimensional entangled state . in the regime of large detuning @xmath56",

    "( [ 222 ] ) and dissipative dynamics from eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ x6 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that if the atoms are initially prepared in different ground states , they will be simultaneously pumped into the bi - excitation state and then decay into one of the ground state subspaces with both atoms in the same state @xmath77 .",
    "the microwave fields of hamiltonian @xmath78 then drive @xmath79 and @xmath80 into @xmath81 or @xmath82 and the process of pumping and decaying repeats again , while leaves the three - dimensional entangled state @xmath61 invariant .",
    "therefore the final population from an arbitrary initial state will be accumulated in the state @xmath61 , i.e. the three - dimensional entangled state @xmath83 is the unique solution of eq .",
    "( [ h9 ] ) .    to effectively measure this kind of three - dimensional entanglement of two particles , we need to introduce the trace norm of the partial transposition @xmath84 , where @xmath85 denotes the partial transposition of @xmath86 with respective to the subsystem of the first atom with basis adopted in eq .",
    "( [ xxx1 ] ) .",
    "the peres - horodecki criterion of separability shows that if @xmath85 is not positive , then @xmath86 is not separable .",
    "the negativity is defined as @xcite @xmath87 which is equal to the absolute value of the sum of negative eigenvalues of @xmath85 . in the ideal case ,",
    "the negativity of a pure three - dimensional entangled state takes the value of unity . in fig .",
    "[ pj ] , we characterizes the dynamical evolution of negativity @xmath0 versus the single - photon detuning parameter @xmath54 and the spontaneously decay rate @xmath88 by numerically solving the steady - state equation ( [ h9 ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the negativity keeps high over a wide range of parameters .",
    "it approaches to unity as the increase of @xmath54 , and the maximum three - dimensional entanglement is found to be 99.91% at @xmath89  mhz , @xmath90  khz within the given range of parameters .",
    "this result is in accordance with the approximation made in eq .",
    "( [ 222 ] ) , since a larger value of @xmath54 is capable of guaranteeing the quantum state with two atoms in the same ground state more stable during the pumping process .      another simple and efficient way to assess the quality of entangled state is the fidelity . in fig .",
    "[ p1 ] , we plot the dependence of steady - state fidelity @xmath91 on the single - photon detuning parameter @xmath54 , provided other parameters are given by @xmath92=0.02  mhz,@xmath88=1  khz , @xmath93 . corresponding to the negativity , the fidelity exhibits asymptotic behaviour as the increase of @xmath54 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ p1 ] further demonstrates the time evolutions of populations for an initially mixed state with @xmath94=0.5  mhz , which signifies a fidelity exceeding 90% is achievable in a short interaction time 100  ms .",
    "it is worth noting that the proposed mechanism is much more like the cooling mechanism in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the laser sideband cooling is applied to induce a relatively large detuning of the desired state but resonant lasers drive all other qubit states .",
    "therefore , our method can also be reconsidered as a cooling process that the whole system is finally cooled into the three - dimensional entangled state at the coaction of rydberd interaction and spontaneous emission .",
    "the considered configuration of atoms not only is successful in the above bipartite entanglement , but also may be helpful for multipartite entanglement . an interesting type of entangled state called @xmath5-particle @xmath5-level singlet states , can be expressed as @xcite @xmath95 is the generalized levi - civita symbol , and the state @xmath96 denotes one base of the qudit .",
    "these entanglement states related to violations of bell s inequalities , are the key resource for the solutions of  @xmath5-strangers \" ,  secret sharing \" and  liar detection \" problems , which have no classical solutions .",
    "now we exploit the possibility to achieve the three - atoms singlet state through the same dissipative - pumping mechanism .",
    "to be concrete , the form of a three - atoms singlet state in connection with the current model reads @xmath97 to complete this task , we may set the rydberg interaction @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "this arrangement guarantees a resonant transition between two atoms when they are in the same state , but a detuned interaction as their states are different .",
    "therefore the atoms will be stabilized in the ground states that each pair of atoms populate in different ground states .",
    "most importantly , the microwave fields leave @xmath2 unchanged but are coupled to other states transition .",
    "finally , the population of three - atoms singlet state will be accumulated into a high value . as shown in fig .",
    "[ pz ] , the evolution of fidelity for this three - atom singlet state versus time is plotted by numerical simulation via fourth - order runge - kutta , where the target state fidelity is stabilized at 79.15% after 300 ms",
    ". this value may be low for quantum computation but are relatively high in the sense of steady - state entanglement .",
    "nowadays , the rydberg atom has been exploited to many fields of quantum information due to the availability of a strong , long - range interaction between rydberg atoms with principal quantum number @xmath100 1 . in this work ,",
    "we have put forward an efficient way for generation of stationary three - dimensional entangled state by combing the coherent dynamics provided by rydberg mediated interaction and the dissipative dynamics induced by spontaneous emission of rydberg state .",
    "both the negativity and fidelity are nearly perfect under the given parameters of cesium atom .",
    "this dissipative mechanism can be also generalized to creation of a three - atom singlet state .",
    "we believe that our work may open a new avenue for the entanglement preparation experimentally in the near future .",
