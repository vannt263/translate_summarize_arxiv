    "observations related to high energy events , indicate the existence of black hole candidates ( bhcs ) . it is usually assumed that black hole solutions are the models of bhcs .",
    "nevertheless there are various nonvacuum solutions in general relativity that are being studied as alternatives to black holes , sometimes called black hole mimickers . among such alternative solutions are wormholes @xcite , gravastars @xcite , brane world solutions @xcite and boson stars @xcite .",
    "predictions on phenomena related to black hole mimickers are important , either because they may rule out the mimicker or at least restrict the parameter space of mimicker configurations .",
    "one of the most important properties of mimickers is the stability . for wormhole solutions instability",
    "has been shown for basic wormhole solutions @xcite , destroying previous hope on the possibility that these are stable as shown in @xcite .",
    "the stability of gravastars has been explored and it has been found that there are stability regions @xcite .",
    "in favor of boson stars the stability of the solutions has been exhaustively studied , using perturbative methods @xcite and using full nonlinear numerical relativity , both in spherical symmetry @xcite and full three dimensions @xcite .    in the particular case of boson stars",
    "they have been studied as sources of gravitational radiation , both as binary systems @xcite and as perturbed boson stars @xcite in the full nonlinear regime .",
    "the study of gravitational wave signatures has also been pursued in order to differentiate between a black hole and a gravastar @xcite .",
    "instead , in the case of wormholes for example , simple solutions ( supported by a phantom scalar field ) would not stand the perturbative analysis and there is no hope for a study of a binary system , because as shown in @xcite the lifetime of these solutions is rather short and they should either collapse and form black holes or explode before they could merge ( although in @xcite it was shown that charged wormholes can have a longer lifetime if the charge parameter is adequately chosen ) . at the end of the day ,",
    "if black hole mimickers are to be compared from all the angles with black holes , mimickers should also be expected to do what black holes can do : they collide and generate gravitational radiation with a given fingerprint .    in this paper",
    "we explore a simple but potentially fruitful problem : the evolution of a test massless scalar field on the space - time of boson stars .",
    "it is well known that , in the case of black holes , the solution of such an equation is related to the quasinormal modes of axial perturbations and electromagnetic test fields @xcite . and",
    "even if this equation is not the perturbation equation of boson stars ( it would involve the perturbation of matter too ) the behavior of the massless scalar field would provide indications on which boson stars look more like black holes , among the big set of boson stars that are mimickers when the power emitted by accretion disks are compared to those due to black holes @xcite . we calculate the numerical solution for various boson star space - times and compare to the solution for the space - time corresponding to a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we track the numerical solution at the level of mode ringing and tail decay .",
    "one of the important ingredients of this paper is that we foliate our space - times with hyperboloidal slices , for which we develop the procedure to foliate a static spherically symmetric space - time with constant mean curvature slices .",
    "following @xcite , we compactify the boundary at @xmath0 ( future null infinity ) which allows one to measure the amplitude of the scalar field at almost arbitrary distances from the source .",
    "the compactification of future null infinity implies the physical metric to be singular at infinity ; this problem is fixed using a rescaling through a conformal transformation @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to achieve correct physical results , we solve the conformally invariant wave equation .",
    "we proceed in this manner because we are interested in measuring the scalar field far from the source and at infinity ; in this case it is natural to consider future null infinity as the boundary because it is the asymptotic boundary of a scalar field propagating at the speed of light .",

    "ii we describe the construction of boson star space - times . in sec .",
    "iii we develop the process of conformal compactification for a spherically symmetric space - time , that we apply to the schwarzschild and boson star space - times . in sec .",
    "iv we present the solution of a massless scalar field on these space - times and compare the behavior by solving the conformally invariant wave equation .",

    "<S> we numerically solve the massless test scalar field equation on the space - time background of boson stars and black holes . in order to do so , we use a numerical domain that contains future null infinity . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve this construction using a scri - fixing conformal compactification technique based on hyperboloidal constant mean curvature foliations of the space - time and solve the conformally invariant wave equation . </S>",
    "<S> we present two results : the scalar field shows oscillations of the quasinormal mode type found for black holes only for boson star configurations that are compact ; and no signs of tail decay are found in the parameter space we explored . even though our results do not correspond to the master equation of perturbations of boson star solutions , </S>",
    "<S> they indicate that the parameter space of boson stars as black hole mimickers is restricted to compact configurations . </S>"
