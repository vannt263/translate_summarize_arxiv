    "the long duration of the deep x - ray minimum can not be explained by an eclipse or absorption , and it imposes strong constrains on the properties of the binary system ( kashi & soker 2009a , c ) .",
    "the source of the hard x - ray emission is the shocked wind of the secondary star ( corcoran et al .",
    "2001 ; pittard & corcoran 2002 ; akashi et al .",
    "the only successful explanation for the long x - ray minimum is the accretion model . in this model for several weeks the less massive secondary star is accreting mass from the primary wind instead of blowing its fast wind . the absence of the secondary wind explains the x - ray minimum . despite that the accretion model",
    "was successfully developed in a series of papers ( soker 2005 ; kashi & soker 2008b , 2009a , to list a few of them ) , not all researchers are convinced that accretion takes place indeed .",
    "numerical simulations of the two winds collision in @xmath0 car did not include the gravity of the secondary star , and could not obtain an accretion ( pittard et al .",

    "2008 ; parkin et al .",
    "numerical simulations that did include the gravity of the stars ( pittard 1998 ; stevens & pollock 1994 ) had parameters that are not relevant to @xmath0 car , and did not consider accretion .    in the present study",
    "we conduct numerical simulations of the collision of the two winds in the @xmath0 car binary system .",

    "the stellar masses are @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , the eccentricity is @xmath7 , and the orbital period is @xmath8 days , hence the semi - major axis is @xmath9 and periastron occurs at @xmath10 .",
    "the mass loss rates and velocities of the winds are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",

    "we have added radiative cooling to the code at all temperatures of @xmath15 .",
    "namely , the radiative cooling is set to zero for temperatures of @xmath16 , but we allow adiabatic cooling to continue below that temperature .",
    "radiative cooling is carefully treated near contact discontinuities , to prevent large temperature gradients from causing unphysical results .",
    "the cooling function @xmath17 ( for solar abundances ) is taken from sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ; their table 6 ) .",
    "gravity by the secondary star is included , as this is the sole issue of this study . in two runs",
    "we added the gravity of the primary star , and show it can not prevent accretion .",
    "however , as the acceleration zone of the primary star is large and we can not add radiative pressure , the primary gravity is not fully self - consistent .",
    "we start by imposing undisturbed winds in the numerical grid , and let the flow reach a steady state without gravity .",
    "only then we turn on gravity , and let the flow reach the new steady state with the gravity included .",
    "the flow does not reach a strict steady state , but rather it posses an erratic motion of the winds collision region that we term wiggling .",
    "the collision region moves back and forth , i.e. , its distance from the stars is not constant , and to the sides , i.e. , the axi - symmetry around the line connecting the two stars is broken .",
    "we perform the numerical simulations in the cartesian geometry @xmath18 mode of the code ( a 3d calculation ) .",
    "results are presented in the ( x , y ) plane that contains the two stars . in most runs",
    "there were 112 equal - size grid points along each axis .",
    "the distance between the two stars is half the length of the x - axis . to confirm the adequacy of the resolution , we run one case with gravity and an orbital separation of @xmath19 and with 175 cells along each axis ( instead of 112 ) .",
    "we found the differences from the lower resolution run to be small .    in the present study we aim at understanding the basic role of gravity , neglecting the role of orbital motion and the acceleration zone of the primary wind .",
    "including these two effects will increase the accretion rate and makes it start earlier even ( see section [ sec : assumptions ] ) .",
    "we set the distance between the stars to be constant at each numerical run , and let the flow reach a , more or less , steady state .",
    "it is not a strict steady state , as the winds interaction zone is wiggling , as was already found by pittard et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , pittard & corcoran ( 2002 ) , okazaki et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and parkin et al .",
    "we conduct the runs with and without the secondary stellar gravity , and for several orbital separations .    at the location of each star",
    "we inject its appropriate wind .",
    "the winds were injected from a square of size @xmath20 cells around each star .",
    "namely , 4 cells from the star along the axes .",
    "this prevents the accreting primary wind to reach a distance closer than 5 cells from the center of the secondary ( as at each time step the condition of outflow is imposed there ) . as in most runs",
    "there are 56 cells between the stars , this closest distance is @xmath21 . as the condition of accretion we take the presence of dense primary wind gas at a distance of 5 cells ( @xmath22 ) from the center of the secondary star .",
    "the boundary conditions of the simulation box are outflow at the @xmath23 sides of the box ; the gas that flows out of the box can not flow back into the box .",
    "our calculations have the aim of revealing the role of gravity in the winds collision process when @xmath0 car approaches its periastron ; near apastron the role of gravity is small . for that we varied only the distance between the stars ( orbital separation ) , and let the flow reach a steady state ( up to a wiggling motion ) with and without gravity .",
    "we now discuss the implications of the main assumptions and approximations .",
    "\\(1 ) _ acceleration zone of the primary wind . _",
    "while we inject the primary wind at its terminal velocity of @xmath24 , the winds from ob super - giants are accelerated over a large distance of about several stellar radii . a commonly fitting formula at several stellar radii is @xmath25^{\\beta}$ ] , with @xmath26 ( e.g. , kraus et al . 2007 , and references therein ) . if , for example , we take @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we find that the wind velocity is @xmath29 ( just before periastron ) and @xmath30 .",
    "the density is @xmath31 times as high compared with the value according to our assumption of a constant wind speed .",
    "when the orbital motion is considered , it is found that the stagnation point of the colliding winds moves toward the secondary , and by that strengthening the accretion process . also , when the acceleration zone is considered , the accretion rate is increased by a substantial fraction ( kashi & soker 2009c ) .",
    "neglecting the acceleration zone is our strongest assumption . including it will make our conclusions that accretion is inevitable stronger even .",
    "\\(2 ) _ clumping in the primary wind . _",
    "the primary wind is most likely clumpy ( moffat & corcoran 2009 ) .",
    "we inject a smooth primary wind , and neglect clumping .",
    "clumps can more easily penetrate the secondary wind ( soker 2005 ) , and might start to be accreted earlier even than what our results indicate .",
    "\\(3 ) _ orbital motion . _",
    "( 3.1 ) the first effect is that there is no cylindrical symmetry in the flow any more .",
    "the effect is most pronounced at large distances from the stagnation point ( okazaki et al . 2008 ) . since accretion starts from regions near the stagnation point , deviation from axi - symmetry",
    "is not a major issue .",
    "( 3.2 ) the inclusion of orbital motion increases the ram pressure of the primary wind before periastron , and will make our results more robust even . for example , about a month before periastron passage the orbital separation is @xmath32 , and the two stars relative velocity is @xmath33 .",
    "inclusion of this velocity will support the accretion process .",
    "the positive role of the orbital motion is most pronounced when the acceleration zone of the primary wind is also considered .",
    "( 3.3 ) the orbital motion implies that our assumption of a steady state brakes down .",
    "we find that when the orbital separation is @xmath34 accretion starts . including the effect discussed above accretion will start at @xmath35 . at @xmath32",
    "the orbital time scale is @xmath36month .",
    "the accretion time is the time the primary wind crosses the distance from the stagnation point to the secondary .",
    "we find this time to be @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the effect of deviation from a steady state when we find accretion to start is very small .",
    "\\(4 ) _ secondary radiation pressure . _ for the parameters used here the radiation pressure is @xmath38 times the ram pressure of the secondary wind ( soker 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , the effect of radiation pressure would be like increasing the ram pressure of the secondary wind by a factor of 1.6 .",
    "but as we neglect the orbital motion , that would increase the ram pressure of the primary wind by a similar factor when accretion starts , we can safely neglect the secondary radiation pressure .",
    "that the secondary radiation can not prevent accretion was discussed in length by soker ( 2005 ) . in any case , we performed one simulation with the secondary mass loss rate set at 1.6 times the regular value .",
    "we still obtained accretion when the orbital separation is @xmath39 .",
    "\\(5 ) _ magnetic fields in the primary wind . _ the post shock primary wind radiatively cools very fast .",
    "it is therefore compressed to high densities by the surrounding pressure .",
    "the compression might amplify an initially weak magnetic field to become dynamically important ( kashi & soker 2007a ) . as discussed by kashi & soker ( 2007a ) , the magnetic fields in the postshock primary wind limit the compression of the postshock primary wind .",
    "this influences the flow structure and the recombination rate of the postshock primary wind .",
    "we neglect the effect of magnetic fields .",
    "we will present the results as temperature , density , and velocity maps for the different cases .",
    "it should be noted that for each case the maps are given at a particular time . although the flow reaches a general steady state , it wiggles around that average steady state ( like a flag in a wind ; pittard et al .",
    "1998 ; pittard & corcoran 2002 ; okazaki et al .",
    "2008 ; parkin et al .",
    "the erratic behavior of the flow appears also in the deviation from initial axisymmetry condition , as any tiny numerical noise is amplified to a large departure from symmetry . in the figures this will be noticed as an asymmetry of the upper and lower parts .",
    "we will demonstrate this for the case of an orbital separation of @xmath19 .",
    "we also recall that the accretion condition is that the dense primary gas reaches the zone of injection of the secondary wind . for most runs",
    "this is at @xmath40 . in table 1",
    "we summarize the cases we run .",

    "the entire wind collision region is bent toward the gravitating secondary star ( the star on the right ) , and a dense blob is clearly seen at a distance of @xmath22 from the secondary .",
    "this is taken as accretion , as it must be accreted under realistic conditions ( rather than an imposed secondary wind in the inner 4 cells ) . to demonstrate the wiggling behavior of the winds collision process , in fig .",

    "but at nearly one month later .",
    "this demonstrates the wiggling behavior of the winds collision process , and our imposed conditions near the secondary star .",
    "if instead of imposing outflowing wind near the secondary , we would let the primary wind to reach the secondary itself , we would had a continuous accretion .",
    "our limited resolution does not allow us to do so as we do not resolve the acceleration zone of the secondary wind . ]     but for run 2gh where the resolution is higher with 88 instead of 56 cells between the two stars .",
    "the secondary wind is injected at a distance of 4 cells , but now it is closer to the secondary as compared with run 2 g .",
    "consequently , the dense primary wind reaches somewhat closer to the secondary star . ]",
    "when the gravity of the secondary is not turn on ( no gravity ) , no accretion takes place .",
    "this is clearly seen from run 2n presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2no ] .",
    "the stagnation point ( the point along the wind collision region where the velocity is zero ) is far from the secondary at all times , and a general bow shock is seen .",

    "the differences between the case with ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2yes ] ) , and without ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2no ] ) , gravity are not only in the presence or not of accretion , but the entire winds collision region is different .",
    "this implies that simulations of the wind collision in @xmath0 car that do not include the secondary gravity are not adequate near periastron passage .     but no gravity is included .",
    "density and arrow scales are as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2yes ] . the differences from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2yes ] are clear : the winds stagnation point is far from the secondary , and no accretion is taking place . ]    to examine the approximate orbital separation where accretion starts we present the cases for @xmath39 ( run 3 g ) and @xmath32 ( run 4 g ) , in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3yes ] and [ fig : fig4yes ] , respectively . for an orbital separation of @xmath39 ( about 17 days before periastron passage ) accretions occurs , while when the orbital separation is @xmath46 ( about 27 days before periastron passage ) , there is no accretion onto the secondary star .",
    "as we do not include the orbital motion and the acceleration zone of the primary wind , there is no point it determining the exact orbital separation where accretion starts under our assumptions .",

    "this is compatible with the time that the x - ray emission starts to decrease ( corcoran 2005 ) .",
    "according to the accretion model , the accreted mass suppresses the secondary wind ( this is not shown here , and will be studied in a future paper ) .",
