    "relativistic heavy - ion experiments have a goal of producing matter at extreme temperatures and energy densities such that conditions are favorable for the transition to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "theoretical calculations predict that the temperatures and energy densities which can be reached at the brookhaven national laboratory s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) will exceed those needed for the formation of the qgp  @xcite .",
    "the production and decay of the @xmath0 meson have long been recognized as an important probe for the state of matter produced in relativistic heavy ion ( rhi ) collisions  @xcite . in @xmath4 collisions",
    "the creation of the @xmath0 is suppressed according to the okubo - zweig - iizuka rule  @xcite .",
    "hence , if there is an enhancement of the @xmath0 yield in rhi collisions relative to @xmath4 collisions , this could be evidence of non - conventional production mechanisms such as strange quark coalescence via the formation and subsequent hadronization of the qgp .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0 yield is undistorted by feed - down from higher mass resonances makes it an attractive probe in this respect .",
    "the decay modes of the @xmath0 , specifically the dilepton channels ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) and the @xmath1 channel , will probe the final state differently should the decay take place in the presence of the qgp - mixed or the completely hadronized phase .",
    "the dileptons will have insignificant interactions with the medium , while the kaons can scatter until freeze - out .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath0 in vacuum is large ( @xmath7  45  fm/@xmath8 ) compared to say a 10  fm sized interaction region .",
    "however , several theoretical calculations  @xcite predict that the @xmath0 mass and width could be significantly modified in either the hot or the cold nuclear medium .",
    "these medium induced effects could be manifested through measured shifts in the mass centroid of the resonance or changes in the resonance width . also predicted are changes in the relative branching ratio between kaon and lepton pairs , with respect to the particle data group ( pdg  @xcite ) .",
    "the production mechanism of strangeness in heavy ion collisions can be investigated through the measurement of the particle yields . in this paper",
    ", we study system size dependence by analyzing centrality selected data .",
    "a comparison between different systems can be made by normalizing to the number of participant pairs .",
    "the expectation is that for production dominated by soft processes , the yields scale as the number of participants .",
    "we compare the centrality dependence of strange and non - strange particle yields in order to reveal the possible flavor dependence .",
    "an additional important question is whether the @xmath0 mesons participate in radial flow together with the other hadrons , or if they freeze - out earlier , as might be true if the small vacuum cross sections of the @xmath0 with hadrons persist in the fireball .",
    "previous measurements have yielded contradictory results  @xcite .",
    "one of the important advantages of rhic experiments is the capability to examine the momentum spectrum as a function of centrality for a variety of hadrons which should yield important additional information on the radial flow issue .",
    "a spectral shape analysis including a simultaneous treatment of the @xmath0 and the more abundant hadrons ( @xmath9 ) will be presented here .    at high @xmath10",
    ", hadrons are primarily produced from the fragmentation of hard - scattered partons .",
    "one of the most exciting results from rhic was the discovery of hadron suppression in central au+au collisions  @xcite where this suppression is absent in d+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , it was also discovered that proton and anti - proton production at intermediate @xmath10 ( 1.54.5  gev/@xmath8 ) scales with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath11 ) as would be expected for hard - scattering in the absence of any nuclear modification  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the intermediate @xmath10 anti - proton to pion ratios were found to exceed by a factor of  3 the values expected from parton fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "these experimental results lead to the conclusion that protons and pions have different production mechanisms at intermediate @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation invokes parton recombination from the qgp  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the nuclear modification factor for the @xmath0 meson , which has a mass comparable to the proton but carries only two quarks , is crucial for understanding the hadron production at intermediate @xmath10 . in this work",
    "we have measured the nuclear modification factor through the ratio @xmath3 of central to peripheral yields scaled by their respective @xmath11  value .",
    "to put our results into perspective , we begin by describing the currently available @xmath0 data obtained in rhi collisions .",
    "the production of @xmath0  mesons has been studied systematically at ever increasing @xmath12 from the ags to rhic .",
    "the e802 collaboration made the first observation of the @xmath0 in fixed target central collisions of 14.6@xmath13  gev  si+au ( @xmath14  5.39  gev ) via the @xmath1 channel  @xcite .",
    "they obtained a ratio @xmath15 , roughly consistent with the ratio obtained in @xmath4 data over a wide range of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the e802 rapidity distributions indicated that the @xmath0 production scaled with the product of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 separate yields , and that there was either significant rescattering of the @xmath0 after production or the production itself came after rescattering of the colliding participants .",
    "also at the ags the e917 experiment has reported another @xmath0 measurement with 11.7a  gev au+au ( @xmath14  4.87  gev ) in the rapidity range @xmath18 in five centrality bins  @xcite the observed yield of the @xmath0 increased towards more central collisions with a distinctly faster than linear dependence on the number of participants .",
    "the yield increase of the @xmath0 in central collisions was stronger than that of the @xmath19 since the @xmath20 ratio increased in central collisions .",
    "however , the @xmath21 and @xmath22 ratios were constant as a function of centrality",
    ".    at the sps the na49 experiment has measured @xmath0 production in @xmath4 , @xmath23+pb , and pb+pb collisions with e@xmath24=158@xmath13  gev ( @xmath14  17.5  gev ) in the rapidity range @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "relative to the @xmath4 yields , these data showed that the ratio of the @xmath0 yield to the @xmath19 yield in central pb+pb collisions was enhanced by a factor @xmath26 .",
    "another sps collaboration , na38/na50 , has measured the @xmath0 in the @xmath6 channel  @xcite , for which the extracted effective temperature and @xmath27 differ from those obtained in the @xmath1 channel in the same systems . the yield difference between the two sps experiments has been calculated to be factors of 24  @xcite , with the na38/na50 result being higher .",
    "the first measurement of the @xmath0 meson at rhic was reported by the star collaboration  @xcite , in the collisions of au+au at @xmath28=130 gev at three centralities , 011% , 1126% , and 2685% in the rapidity range @xmath29 .",
    "the extracted temperature @xmath30 and the ratio @xmath31 did not vary with centrality .",
    "one may summarize the current state of knowledge of @xmath0 production in heavy ion collisions by stating that the topic remains highly unexplored territory .",
    "the heavy - ion measurements do indicate that the observed @xmath0 yield is not a simple linear superposition of nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "rather the data imply the influence of some collective effects .",
    "whether those effects are induced by cold and/or hot nuclear matter , there do not yet exist definitive measurements .",
    "moreover , there has not been so far precise enough heavy - ion data which can address the question of the change in the @xmath0 mass or its width in the cold nuclear or the hot qgp medium . and except for one experiment measuring the dimuon channel , there is a scarcity of useful quantitative information in heavy ion collisions concerning the @xmath0 decay into dileptons .    in this paper",
    "we report on a measurement of the @xmath0 yield at mid - rapidity in collisions of au+au beams from rhic at @xmath2  gev as measured in the @xmath1 channel by the phenix detector .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we give a short review of the phenix detector configuration . in section",
    "iii we describe the data analysis procedure .",
    "section iv presents and discusses the results .",
    "the first precision measurements of @xmath0 mass and width values obtained in relativistic heavy ion collisions as a function of centrality are given in section iv  a .",
    "absolute yields as a function of for three centrality bins are shown in section iv ",
    "the centrality dependence of yields and ratios are studied in section  iv  d . in section iv ",
    "d the spectra shapes are interpreted in the framework of a hydrodynamical model and the freeze - out conditions are extracted .",
    "finally , the nuclear modification factor @xmath3 for the @xmath0 is obtained and compared to those of pions and protons in section  iv  e .",
    "the phenix detector consists of two spectrometer arms at near zero rapidity , two forward rapidity muon spectrometers , and three global event characterization detectors .",
    "the central arm spectrometers , shown schematically in fig .  [ fg : phenix_2002_beam ] , are located east and west of the beam line with @xmath32 radian azimuthal coverage each .",
    "these spectrometers are designed to detect photons , electrons , and charged hadrons .",
    "the @xmath0 data for this paper were obtained with the central arm detector subsystems which provide high resolution particle identification and momentum reconstruction .",
    "a complete description of the phenix apparatus has been published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we present a brief review of the relevant detector subsystems in the following sections .",
    "the global detectors furnish the start time signals , collision vertex measurements , and interaction centrality . the centrality for events in the au+au collisions is determined  @xcite by combining the data from two subsystems : the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc )  @xcite and the beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite .",
    "the zdc are hadronic calorimeters located 18  m downstream and upstream of the interaction point along the beam line .",
    "these calorimeters detect the energy carried by spectator neutrons .",
    "the bbc are @xmath33erenkov telescopes placed @xmath34  m the center of the beam collision region in the pseudo - rapidity region 3.0  @xmath35  @xmath36  @xmath35  3.9 .",
    "the correlation between the zdc energy sum and the charge sum recorded in the bbc determines the centrality of the collision event .",
    "the bbc data also determine the longitudinal collision coordinate ( @xmath37 ) and the start time for the time - of - flight measurements .",
    "beam s eye view of the phenix central arm detector subsystems.,title=\"fig : \" ]      the central arm spectrometers  @xcite in phenix provide charged particle tracking and particle identification .",
    "this analysis was done with the east arm spectrometer .",
    "the @xmath38 decay kinematics are such that that the phenix detector has negligible acceptance for the very low @xmath39 @xmath0 particles which would decay into east - west kaon pairs .",
    "the data included information from the drift chamber ( dc ) , the pad chambers ( pc1 and pc3 ) , the high resolution time - of - flight wall ( tof ) , and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) lead - scintillator detectors ( pbsc ) , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fg : phenix_2002_beam ] .    pattern recognition and tracking of the charged particles",
    "are accomplished using the dc information by a combinatorial hough transform method  @xcite .",
    "the dc subsystem is located at an average radial distance of 2.2  m from the beam line .",
    "it is a projective tracking detector providing high precision measurements in the azimuthal @xmath40 plane , which are combined with the @xmath41 single spatial point measurement from the pc1 located at @xmath42  m. these data , together with the bbc @xmath37 information , are sufficient to determine the track s initial momentum vector whose magnitude is obtained with a resolution @xmath43 ( gev/@xmath8 ) .",
    "the first term in this expression is due to the multiple scattering before the dc and the second term is the angular resolution of the dc .",
    "based on identified mass measurements obtained with the tof subsystem , the absolute momentum scale is known to @xmath44 .",
    "tracks obtained from the dc / pc1 detectors are projected to the pc3 , tof , and pbsc detectors where associations can be made .",
    "the high resolution tof subsystem provides one set of mass measurements while the pbsc detectors provide a geometrically independent set of mass measurements .",
    "the tof wall is positioned 5.06  m from the beam line and consists of 960 scintillator slats oriented along the azimuthal direction .",
    "it is designed to cover @xmath45 and @xmath46 in azimuthal angle .",
    "the pbsc detector , covering half of the east arm and entire west arm , can also be used for hadron timing measurements .",
    "the present analysis uses the pbsc modules in the east arm which are located at 5.1  m in radial distance from the beam line and cover a @xmath47 azimuthal range .",
    "this detector is constructed as separate towers of dimension 5.25  x  5.25  x  37  @xmath48 , in an alternating lead - scintillator sandwich type structure ( `` shish - kebob '' ) , approximately 18  radiation lengths in depth . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg : phenix_2002_beam ] the tof and the pbsc sectors are completely non - overlapping .",
    "in this section , we describe the event and track selection , particle identification , the details of @xmath49 pair reconstruction , and the corrections for geometrical acceptance , particle decay in flight , multiple scattering , and detector occupancy factors , all of which couple into deriving the @xmath0 meson spectra .",
    "the events selected for this analysis were based on the phenix minimum - bias trigger provided by the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) and zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc ) . as noted previously ,",
    "the centrality of each au + au collision event was determined by correlating the bbc charge sum and the zdc total energy  @xcite .",
    "the phenix minimum - bias data sample included @xmath50  % of the 6.9 barn au + au total inelastic cross section  @xcite .",
    "this analysis used 20  million minimum - bias events with a vertex position within @xmath51 cm .    to study the centrality dependent physics , we divided these events into different centrality bins . for the @xmath0 meson line shape analysis",
    ", we used five centrality bins : 010% , 1020% , 2040% , 4060% and 6092% .",
    "the transverse mass ( @xmath52 ) spectra were reconstructed for three centrality bins : 010% , 1040% and 4092% .",
    "these bin divisions were chosen to have approximately equal statistical significance for their respective data points . the centrality of collisions is additionally characterized by the average number of participants ( @xmath53 ) and the average number of binary nucleon  nucleon collisions ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "these two global quantities , shown in table  [ ncoll ] as a function of centrality , are derived from a glauber model calculation  @xcite .",
