    "excitons are the quanta of the fundamental optical excitations in both insulators and semiconductors in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum of light .",
    "they consist of a negatively charged electron in the conduction band and a positively charged hole in the valence band .",
    "wannier excitons extend over a huge number of unit cells and can be described within the simple band model as hydrogen - like particles  @xcite .",
    "recently , the corresponding hydrogen - like exciton absorption spectrum could be followed up to a principal quantum number of @xmath8 in cuprous oxide @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this recent experiment led to a variety of new theoretical and experimental investigations on the topic of excitons in @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "when investigating exciton spectra of @xmath7 using high resolution spectroscopy and crystals of high quality , two of the most striking experimental findings are the observation of @xmath9 excitons and a splitting of the @xmath0  exciton depending on its total momentum @xmath2 .",
    "both effects can not be understood within a simple effective mass model .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3 dependent splitting of the @xmath0 exciton was attributed by dasbach  _ et  al _",
    "@xcite to a @xmath3 dependent exchange interaction .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the common treatment of the exchange interaction for @xmath7 , where only a @xmath3 independent analytic exchange and a vanishing nonanalytic exchange interaction are considered .    since we have recently shown that the observed splitting could also be explained by taking full account of the anisotropic dispersion of the @xmath10 orbital bloch states  @xcite , we believe that the influence of a @xmath3 dependent exchange interaction on the @xmath0 ortho exciton in @xmath7 deserves a closer investigation as it is _ a priori _ unknown whether dispersion _ and _ exchange interaction are of the same size .",
    "although a preliminary investigation as regards the presence of a @xmath3 dependent exchange interaction was undertaken by kavoulakis  _ et  al _",
    "@xcite , their treatment was limited to the nonanalytic part of the exchange interaction only and lacking a consideration of the complete valence band structure of @xmath7 .",
    "using @xmath4 perturbation theory , we derive general expressions for both the analytic and nonanalytic part of the exchange interaction for all direct excitons up to basically arbitrary order in @xmath3 .",
    "this allows us not only to show the unknown fact that the appearance of a @xmath3 dependent exchange interaction is inseparably connected to a @xmath3 independent exchange interaction of @xmath5 and @xmath6 excitons but also to estimate the magnitude of the @xmath3 dependent terms from microscopic calculations for both parts of the interaction .",
    "this is furthermore in contrast to the simple group theoretical treatment of the exchange interaction of refs .",
    "@xcite , which leads to @xmath3 dependent terms of the correct form but does not yield the their prefactors .",
    "since every @xmath3 dependent energy as regards states of the symmetry @xmath11 must lead to matrices of the form presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the unambiguous assigment of the experimentally observed @xmath3 dependent splitting to the exchange interaction is not possible by these means .",
    "moreover , as regards the nonanalytic exchange interaction , we go beyond the treatment of kavoulakis  _ et  al _",
    "@xcite and pay special attention to its angular dependency .",
    "this allows us to prove the occurence of a coupling between longitudinal and transverse excitons in @xmath7 due to the @xmath3 dependent terms of this part of the exchange interaction .",
    "hence , we show that all three ortho exciton states couple to light if the wave vector is not oriented in a direction of high symmetry .",

    "[ sec : summary - and - outlook ] .",
    "in this section we derive the @xmath3 dependent terms of the analytic and the nonanalytic exchange interaction based on the main expressions of the exchange interaction given in refs .  @xcite . within the scope of the simple band model the wave function of an exciton",
    "is given by @xmath12 the envelope function @xmath13 is the fourier transform of the hydrogen - like solution @xmath14 of the wannier equation  @xcite , @xmath15 with @xmath16 being a short notation for the three quantum numbers @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "note that the coordinate @xmath20 is a lattice vector which takes in general only discrete values .",
    "the constant factors @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend on the effective masses of electron and hole .",
    "additionally , the wave function  ( [ eq : psiexc ] ) contains a slater determinant of bloch functions with one electron being in a bloch state of the conduction band and @xmath23 electrons in bloch states of the valence bands , @xmath24 here @xmath25 denotes the antisymmetrization operator .    in the wannier equation the exchange energy is missing since it is often treated as a correction to the hydrogen - like solution  @xcite . in general , the exchange energy between two exciton states @xmath26 and @xmath27 reads  @xcite    @xmath28    the exchange energy includes the term @xmath29 . introducing the total spin @xmath30 of electron and hole , this term can be written with singlet and triplet states as @xmath31  @xcite .    inserting the fourier",

    "( [ eq : hexchk ] ) , we can write the exchange energy as @xmath35 with @xmath36 the functions @xmath37 denote the lattice - periodic part of the bloch functions @xmath38  @xcite . in the representation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hexchm2 ] ) the exchange energy can be divided into the nonanalytic part @xmath39 , which is the summand with @xmath40 , and the analytic part @xmath41 , which is the sum of the remaining terms .",
    "note that if the exchange energy is formulated in the wannier representation  @xcite instead of the representation with bloch functions , it is generally separated into a long - range and a short - range part .",
    "however , according to refs .",
    "@xcite there is no identity between the nonanalytic exchange and the long - range part or between the analytic exchange and the short - range part but only a close correspondence .    in the limit @xmath42 one",
    "obtains the simple expression  @xcite @xmath43 for the nonanalytic exchange energy of excitons in a cubic crystal . by @xmath44",
    "we denote the lattice constant of the solid .",
    "the expression  ( [ eq : hexchnalr ] ) depends only on the two angles between @xmath45 and the dipole moments @xmath46 or @xmath47 with @xmath48 the localized charge density or transition density  @xcite @xmath49 with @xmath50 is often given in terms of wannier functions @xmath51",
    "if @xmath52 is parallel or perpendicular to @xmath45 , one speaks of longitudinal or transversal excitons , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the nonanalytic exchange energy therefore causes a longitudinal - transverse splitting ( lt - splitting ) of spin singlet states near @xmath53 .",
    "it is obvious that the nonanalytic exchange energy is nonzero only for longitudinal excitons and that it is therefore connected to a macroscopic polarization .",
    "thus , the effect can be compared to the lt - splitting of phonons .",
    "since the splitting between transverse and longitudinal excitons depends on @xmath54 for @xmath55 , it is proportional to the oscillator strength @xmath56 for exciting one exciton from the ground state of the solid by light .",
    "this oscillator strength reads for @xmath42  @xcite @xmath57 with the energy @xmath58 of the exciton state  @xcite , the free electron mass @xmath59 and the polarization vector @xmath60 perpendicular to @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the splitting caused by @xmath39 is identical to the lt - splitting when treating polaritons  @xcite and it is of appreciable size only if the exciton is dipole allowed .",
    "it is now important to note that light is always transversely polarized and that only transverse excitons are produced in optical absorption  @xcite [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : oscstr ] ) ] .",
    "longitudinal excitons can not be seen in optical absorption spectra .",
    "thus , the lt - splitting in the case of polaritons increases the transverse excitons by an energy @xmath61 . on the other hand , the lt - splitting connected to the nonanalytic exchange interaction increases the energy of the longitudinal excitons by the same amount @xmath61 .",
    "finally , both states are again degenerate at @xmath53 , which is required for reasons of symmetry",
    ".    we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hexchnalr ] ) that longitudinal and transverse exciton states are not coupled for @xmath42 . as has been stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this uncoupling is `` accidental '' since it is expected that these states are decoupled only if they transform according to different irreducible representations of the group of @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "however , the higher order terms @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hexchnalr ] ) may lead to a coupling of longitudinal and transverse exciton states unless they transform according to different irreducible representations .",
    "this will be shown for @xmath7 in sec .",
    "[ sub : nonanalytic - exchange - interaction ] .",
    "if a coupling occurs , the longitudinal states will become observable in experiments due to the admixture of transverse states  @xcite .",

    "the sum over @xmath69 can be evaluated using @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "it is evident that the derivatives of the function @xmath74 at the origin must enter the exchange interaction since we could also treat the interaction in the wannier representation  @xcite and obtain higher order terms using a taylor expansion at @xmath75 .    due to the special properties of the wave functions @xmath74 , the expression  ( [ eq : fgrad ] )",
    "is nonzero only if @xmath76 holds .",
    "therefore , we see that the leading term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mkg ] ) describes the @xmath3 independent exchange interaction of @xmath77 excitons .",
    "the terms of higher order show that the appearance of a @xmath3 dependent exchange interaction of @xmath77 excitons is inseparably connected to a @xmath3 _ _ in__dependent exchange interaction of @xmath5 and @xmath6 excitons .",
    "as the function @xmath63 enters quadratically the exchange energy  ( [ eq : hexchm2 ] ) , the relative size of the @xmath3 dependent exchange energy of @xmath77 excitons and the @xmath3 _ _ in__dependent exchange energy of @xmath5 excitons can estimated comparing @xmath78 with @xmath79 here we have introduced the exciton bohr radius @xmath80 and the value @xmath81 of @xmath3 at the exciton photon resonance  @xcite .",
    "note that there are always polaritons and no excitons in bulk semiconductors due to the coupling between excitons and photons .",
    "however , if this coupling is weak , it is common to speak of excitons and treat the interaction within perturbation theory  @xcite .    for the nonanalytic exchange interaction , the expression  ( [ eq : mkg ] )",

    "the different terms describe the nonanalytic exchange energy of @xmath77 excitons ( @xmath3 independent and @xmath3 dependent ) and of @xmath5 excitons . in the literature usually only the leading terms of the exchange energy",
