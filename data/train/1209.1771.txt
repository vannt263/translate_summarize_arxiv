    "quantum entanglement is one of the most fascinating characteristic of quantum physics , a fantastic application of entanglement @xcite is quantum teleportation , which plays a key role in the field of quantum communication . since the seminal work of bennett et al .",
    "@xcite , teleportation has been the research interest of researchers and a number of work both in theory and experiments has been devoted to it @xcite .    up to now the teleportation has been studied in different branches , such as directly and network controlled teleportation @xcite ; discrete - variables and continuous - variables teleportation @xcite ; prefect and probabilistic teleportation @xcite and so on .",
    "in fact , one of the key problem of teleportation is how to construct an usefulness quantum channel , different channels will yield different results , some channels can be used to realize perfect teleportation , while some others can only enable probabilistic teleportation .",
    "because of the inevitable interaction with its surroundings , correlations in quantum states are difficult to maintain @xcite , therefore the probabilistic teleportation @xcite has been widely discussed in recent years .    a necessary and sufficient condition for realizing perfect teleportation and",
    "successful teleportation has been given in @xcite .",
    "based on the bell basis measurement , we found that if the channel parameter matrix ( cpm ) is unitary , then one can always realize a perfect teleportation ( i.e. , the successful probability @xmath1 ) , if the cpm is invertible but not unitary , however , one can only realize a probabilistic teleportation ( i.e. , the successful probability @xmath2 ) .    motivated by the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the authors introduced an auxiliary qubit to realize probabilistic teleportation , we propose some unitary transformation methods in probabilistic teleportation in this work .",
    "these methods are based on different entanglement matching coefficients @xmath0 which corresponding to different unitary transformations . through detailed analysis with the bell basis and generalized bell basis measurement in two probabilistic teleportation processes",
    ", we suggest a general probability of successful teleportation , which is not only determined by the entanglement degree of transmission channel and measurement methods , but also related to the unitary transformation in the teleportation process . for example",
    ", if we teleport the unknown one - qubit state @xmath3 via the channel state @xmath4 , then the whole probability of successful teleportation is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "our conclusion covers and complements the results of ref . @xcite . as different @xmath0",
    "will give different kinds of evolution methods , one can have more flexible and selectable evolution method experimentally .",
    "suppose alice wants to send an unknown one - qubit state @xmath3 to bob @xmath7 where @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being taken to be 0 or 1 and a repeated index denotes summation .",
    "the general two - qubit state @xmath10 used as the quantum channel can be expressed as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12 . if alice adopts the standard bell basis measurement ( bm ) @xmath13 @xmath14 on her particles , i.e. , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "then with the denotation of bell basis @xcite , the total state of the system can be rewritten as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the element of @xmath19    after alice s measurement , the total state will collapse to @xmath20 obviously , based on the bm method , all the @xmath21 are unitary .",
    "so if the cpm @xmath22 is unitary , one can always realize the perfect teleportation ( i.e. , the whole probability @xmath1 ) , if @xmath22 is invertible but not unitary , one can only realize a probabilistic teleportation ( i.e. , the whole probability @xmath2 ) .    in ref .",
    "li et al . presented a protocol of probabilistic teleportation by introducing an auxiliary qubit state @xmath23 and performing an unitary transformation on bob s state .",
    "they employ a partially entangled state as the quantum channel , that is @xmath24 with @xmath25 being real numbers and @xmath26 .",
    "the cpm @xmath27 is obviously invertible but not unitary , so bob can not directly retrieve the state by acting @xmath28 on the collapsed state @xmath29 .    with the standard bell basis @xmath30 , the total state of the system can be rewritten as @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after alice s bm @xmath32 , bob will get the unnormalized state as follows @xmath33    in order to obtain the original state , one can introduce an auxiliary qubit state @xmath23 @xcite in bob s state , now bob s state can be express as @xmath34    with the standard two - qubit basis @xmath35 with parameter @xmath0 for the particles ( a,3 ) @xmath36 where we called @xmath0 the entanglement matching coefficient of bob s evolution . to ensure the transformation @xmath37 to be unitary , we demand @xmath38",
    ". there are different unitary transformation methods with different @xmath0 .    after bob s evolution",
    ", the state @xmath39 turns out to be @xmath40    certainly , @xmath41 is not normalized .",
    "now bob performs measurement on the auxiliary qubit @xmath42 , if the measurement outcome is @xmath43 , the teleportaton fails , if the measurement outcome is @xmath44 , the teleportation is successfully accessed and bob s state becomes @xmath45 and bob s @xmath46 probability . from eq .",
    "( 7 ) one can obtain the bell state @xmath47 occurring probability as @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , the bell state @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 occurring probability are @xmath52 , p^3_a = p^4_a=\\frac{1}{{2}}[(a\\beta)^2+(b\\alpha)^2],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath53 then @xmath54 , which is just the prefect teleportation .",
    "now we compute the probability of bob for obtaining the original state from the state @xmath39 .",
    "the normalized state corresponding to the state in eq .",
    "( 11 ) is latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     after bob s successful measurement on @xmath44 , the probability @xmath56 of obtaining the original state from the state @xmath39 is @xmath57    we consider alice s measurement and bob s different operations in the teleportation process .",
    "for alice s each measurement and bob s operation , the probability of obtaining the initial state is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is just the square of coefficient of the state @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) .    summing all the contributions of @xmath61 , we obtain the whole probability of successful teleportation as @xmath62 where @xmath38 .    if @xmath63 , we take @xmath64 , then the optimal probability is @xmath65 .",
    "when @xmath53 then @xmath66 , which is just the case for prefect teleportation , and for this special case @xmath37 is the same as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath67    for different matching coefficients @xmath0 , one can adopt different kinds of unitary transformation .",
    "for example , when @xmath68 the whole probability of successful teleportation is @xmath69 and our unitary transformation matrix turns out to be @xmath70    next we discuss some difference between the probability @xmath71 and @xmath72 for two kinds of unitary transformation . for arbitrary @xmath26 and @xmath73 , there are always @xmath74 .",
    "20 ) is an unitary transformation for obtaining the optimal probability .",
    "however , the condition @xmath26 and @xmath75 yields @xmath76 , and therefore one can only obtain probability @xmath77 . when @xmath68 we have @xmath69 , and the normalization condition @xmath26 gives rise to @xmath78 with @xmath79 , thus one can only attain the probability @xmath80 for @xmath73 .    because @xmath6 , when @xmath81 ( here @xmath75 and @xmath82 ) , then @xmath83 .",
    "for this case there are a little difference between the probability @xmath71 and @xmath84 for the two kinds of unitary transformation ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    fig .",
    "comparison of the probability with different channel parameters .",
    "different matching coefficients @xmath0 correspond to different unitary transformations .",
    "although @xmath85 , it provides one with more flexible selection for probabilistic teleportation .",
    "considering now alice makes a generalized bell basis measurement ( gbm ) , these are @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 the transformation matrix @xmath89 between the generalized bell basis and computation basis @xmath90 is @xmath91    let us reconsider the aforementioned one - qubit teleportation , under the generalized bell basis , the total state of the system is @xmath92    after alice s gbm @xmath93 , bob will get the corresponding unnormalized state as follows @xmath94    when bob introduced an auxiliary qubit state @xmath23 for @xmath95 , and make an unitary transformation @xmath96 to the state @xmath97 , with @xmath98 where @xmath99 , the state @xmath39 becomes @xmath100    if bob s measurement outcome is @xmath23 , the teleportation is successfully implemented .    considering alice s bell basis measurement @xmath101 and bob s evolution on @xmath39 , the probability of successful teleportation is @xmath102 similarly , after bob s @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 transformation to the corresponding states and measurement on the auxiliary qubit , the probability of successful teleportation respectively are @xmath106 thus the whole probability of successful teleportation is @xmath107    next we discuss the optimal probability of successful teleportation by entanglement matching for the following two cases :    \\(1 ) @xmath108 . for this case , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , so we take @xmath111 in @xmath96 and @xmath104 , @xmath112 in @xmath103 and @xmath105 , for which one can obtain @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "the optimal whole probability is @xmath115    \\(2 ) @xmath116 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath117 , so we take @xmath118 , @xmath119 , for which we have @xmath113 , @xmath120 .",
    "the optimal whole probability is @xmath121    from the above analysis , one can see that the optimal probability of successful teleportation is determined by the smaller value of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , i.e. , the optimal probability is determined by the entanglement degree of alice s measurement or the quantum channel .",
    "however , for @xmath124 , the whole probability of successful teleportation is @xmath125 .",
    "therefor , the general probability of successful teleportation is not only determined by the factors of the channel and measurement , but also related to the unitary transformation during teleportation process .",
    "the unavoidable influence of environment always induces degradation of quantum correlations , therefor the study of probabilistic teleportation is significant for quantum information processing . in this paper , we generalized the protocol of probabilistic teleportation by introducing an auxiliary qubit and the unitary transformation methods . moreover , through the analysis based on the bell basis and generalized bell basis measurement in two probabilistic teleportation , we suggested a general probability of successful teleportation , which is not only determined by both the entanglement degree of transmission channels and the measurement methods , but also related to unitary transformation in teleportation process , i.e. , @xmath72 , although @xmath126 ( the optimal @xmath37 transformation ) .",
    "however in experiment , it is more important to realize successful teleportation . as different entanglement matching coefficients @xmath0 will give different @xmath37 evolution methods , so one can have more flexible selectable evolution method experimentally .",
