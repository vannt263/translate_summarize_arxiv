    "entanglement is synonymous of quantum correlations that can not be explained by any local classical theory . initially",
    "this notion was relegated to foundational issues , but in the last decades it has pervaded quantum information and other areas of physics @xcite .",
    "being a purely quantum phenomenon it was considered fragile under contamination of environment noise in open quantum systems .",
    "nevertheless , in recent years it has been shown that it can persist for long time up to stationary conditions in several contexts @xcite ( see also @xcite for a striking experiment on long living entanglement ) .",
    "more importantly it has been shown that the environment can play a constructive role in establishing entanglement @xcite .",
    "quite remarkably it happens that even without any interaction among subsystems a common dissipative environment is able to induce entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , this possibility has been proved true only for systems composed by two subsystems due to technical difficulties arising when accounting for more subsystems .",
    "here we overcome these difficulties and achieve results for an arbitrary number of subsystems by considering a limited number of initially available excitations and by exploiting a power expansion for the dissipation superoperator .",
    "this allows us to restrict the analysis to a low dimensional subspace of the operators space .",
    "we find that pairwise entanglement is not created at any time between initially excited qubits .",
    "instead , it is created and persists at steady state for pairs of initially excited and initially not excited qubits .",
    "the same holds true for pairs of qubits initially in the ground state , but in such a case the amount of entanglement is negligibly smaller than the previous case .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath0 qubits with associated hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the orthonormal basis , with @xmath3 ( resp .",
    "@xmath4 ) the ground ( resp .",
    "excited ) single qubit state .",
    "we want to study the dynamics of this system of qubits when they dissipate together into an environment at zero temperature .",
    "it will be governed by the lindblad master equation @xcite : @xmath5 where : = _ i=1^n_i , with @xmath6 for the @xmath7th qubit .",
    "the dissipation rate has been set equal to @xmath8 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "let us describe the strategy we will put into practice to solve .",
    "the fomal solution reads @xmath9 . to explicitly find @xmath10",
    "let us first write the taylor expansion : @xmath11 now notice that once the initial state @xmath12 has been chosen , the dynamics ( being purely dissipative at zero temperature ) can only decrease the number of initial excitation present in @xmath12 .",
    "that is , repeated applications of @xmath13 to @xmath12 will leave the state within a subspace @xmath14 of the hilbert space @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the dual of @xmath17 . after having identified @xmath18 , i.e. a set of operators on @xmath17 spanning @xmath18",
    ", we will write down @xmath12 as linear combination of such operators with unknown time dependent coefficients . then , by inserting this expansion into eq . we will derive a set of linear differential equations for the unknown coefficients . in this way",
    "if the initial state contains a small number of excitation we can hope to provide an analytical solution .",
    "in fact given a number of initial excitations @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) the following inequality holds true : dim _ ( 0 ) ( 2^e ) ^2 ( 2^n ) ^2 = dim .",
    "[ eqdim ]    finally , notice that does not satisfy the condition for the uniqueness of a stationary solution .",
    "this condition requires that the only operators commuting with the lindblad operator @xmath21 must be multiples of identity @xcite .",
    "hence we should expect different steady states depending on the choice of @xmath12 .",
    "in this section we assume that initially only the @xmath23th qubit is in the excited state while all the others are in the ground state .",
    "let us denote this state as @xmath24 , then @xmath25 .    by applying @xmath13 to @xmath25",

    "the same holds true for pairs of qubits initially in the ground state , but in such a case the amount of entanglement is negligibly smaller than the previous case .",
    "this lead to the emergence of structures ( subgraphs ) which makes this subject appealing also from the perspective of complex networks @xcite .    finally , it is worth noticing that the extension of the presented analysis to states with an arbitrary number @xmath19 of initial excitations can be done in a computationally efficient way due to the polynomial scaling of @xmath71 vs @xmath19 .",
    "we can arrive at such a scaling ( much tighter with respect to the bound given in eq.([eqdim ] ) ) , by simply observing the results in sec.iii and iv .",
