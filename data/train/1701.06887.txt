    "<S> such a quantity is routinely measured in single particle tracking experiments and in fact includes all the memory effects in the case of gaussian processes . at long times , the msd is assumed to diverge and thus , typically , the particle does not remain close to its initial position . </S>",
    "<S> last , the process is continuous and non smooth@xcite ( @xmath7 ) , meaning that the trajectory is irregular and of fractal type , similarly to the standard brownian motion . note that the class of random walks that we consider here covers a broad spectrum of non - markovian processes used in physics , and in particular the examples mentioned above .    </S>",
    "<S> the random walker is now confined in a domain of volume @xmath8 with reflecting walls , and we focus on its mean fpt to a target of position @xmath9 ( see fig . [ figsketch ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that this setting gives also access to the reaction kinetics of a reactant in the presence of a concentration @xmath10 of targets in infinite space . </S>",
    "<S> while the theory can be developed in any space dimension ( see si for an explicit treatment of the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cases ) , it is presented here for clarity in dimension 1 ( see fig . [ figsketch]b ) . </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath12 stands for the probability density for being at position @xmath9 at time @xmath1 , @xmath13 is the fpt density and @xmath14 is the probability that @xmath9 at time @xmath1 given that the first - passage event occurred at time @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> the exact formula ( [ mfpt921 ] ) is a generalization of the expression obtained for markovian processes @xcite and holds for any non - markovian process ( even non - gaussian ) . even if @xmath21 is _ a priori </S>",
    "<S> _ a non trivial quantity because it is conditioned by first - passage events , this equation is of great practical use to determine the mean fpt as we show next . </S>",
    "<S> to proceed further , we ( i ) consider the large volume limit @xmath22 ( where it is assumed that all boundary points are sent to infinity ) and ( ii ) assume that the stochastic process in the future of the fpt , defined by @xmath23 , is gaussian with mean @xmath24 and same covariance as the initial process @xmath0 ( see fig . [ figsketch]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> simulations and perturbation theory below show the broad validity of this approach . </S>",

    "<S> eq.([key2 ] ) , which allows for a self - consistent determination of the mean future trajectory @xmath24 , together with eq.([key1 ] ) , provide the mean fpt and constitute our main result .    at this stage </S>",
    "<S> , several remarks can be done . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) the mean fpt depends linearly on the confining volume @xmath8 , which extends the result obtained for markovian processes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) our approach reveals the key role played by the mean trajectory @xmath24 followed by the walker in the _ future _ of the first - passage event . in other words , even if the real motion is stopped at the first encounter with the target , the mean fpt is controlled by the statistical properties of the fictious path that the walker would follow if allowed to continue after the first encounter event . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) assuming that @xmath32 at large times , with @xmath33 , it can be shown from the asymptotic analysis of eq.([key2 ] ) that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a coefficient depending on the entire msd function @xmath36 ( at all time scales ) and on @xmath2 ( it generally has the same sign as @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for processes that are subdiffusive at long times ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath24 comes back to the initial position @xmath2 of the walker , which is consequently not forgotten . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> asymptotically superdiffusive walkers ( @xmath38 ) keep going away from the target in the future of the fpt with a non trivial exponent . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors reflect the anticorrelation and correlation of successive steps of subdiffusive and superdiffusive walks , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that even for asymptotically diffusive processes ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath24 tends to a non vanishing constant , in contrast to a pure ( markovian ) brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) the importance of non - markovian effects can be appreciated by comparing the mean fpt to the result obtained by setting @xmath40 , which amounts to neglecting the memory of the trajectory before the first - passage . as shown by eq.([behaviormuinfinity ] ) , @xmath24 is actually not small , so that memory effects are significant . </S>",
    "<S> these are especially marked for @xmath41 , where setting @xmath40 in eq.([key1 ] ) leads to an infinite mean fpt , as opposed to our finite non - markovian prediction .    </S>",
    "<S> we now confirm the validity of these analytical results by comparing them to numerical simulations of representative examples of non - markovian processes defined by the msd @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) the choice @xmath42 corresponds to the generic case where the position @xmath0 is coupled to other degrees of freedom at the single time scale @xmath43 ( fig . [ fig1d]a , e ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is typically relevant to tracers moving in nematics @xcite or solutions of non - adsorbing polymers @xcite . ( 2 ) the choice @xmath44 where @xmath33 and @xmath45 is a positive transport coefficient ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1d]b , c , d , f , g , h ) , corresponds to the emblematic fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) used in fields as varied as hydrology @xcite , finance @xcite and biophysics@xcite ; it is in particular a good description of anomalous diffusion in various physical situations such as telomere motion @xcite or tracer diffusion in viscoelastic fluids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this process is strongly non - markovian , as shown by its long ranged correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> for fbm , the solution of eq.([key2 ] ) is of the form @xmath46 , so that the mean fpt reads @xmath47 with @xmath48 a numerical coefficient given in si . </S>",
    "<S> this equation gives the explicit dependence of the mean fpt on @xmath2 and generalizes the results obtained for markovian processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the theory can be extended to higher dimensions with the supplementary assumption that the random walk is isotropic ; two - dimensional and three - dimensional versions of the choices of @xmath36 considered in points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have been analyzed explicitly ( fig . [ fig3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> actually , as shown in si , the theory is exact at order @xmath49 when one considers a msd function of the type @xmath50 where the small parameter @xmath51 measures the deviation to a markovian process ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1d],[fig3 ] reveal very good quantitative agreement between the analytical predictions and the numerical simulations far beyond this perturbative regime . </S>",
    "<S> both the volume and the source - target distance dependence of the mean fpt are unambiguously captured by the theoretical analysis , at all the length - scales involved in the problem . </S>",
    "<S> note that , even if the theoretical prediction relies on large volume asymptotics , numerical simulations show that it is accurate even for small confining systems ( here on the example of cubic shapes ) . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the very different nature of these examples ( space dimension 1,2 and 3 , diffusive , superdiffusive or subdiffusive at long times ... ) demonstrates the wide range of applicability of our approach . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the amplitude of memory effects is significant in the examples shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1d],[fig3 ] , where the multiplicative factor between markovian and non - markovian estimates of the mean fpt can be up to 15 ( fig . [ fig1d]c ) . as discussed above , </S>",
    "<S> this factor is even infinite for the fbm as soon as @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , even for the process ( 1 ) which is diffusive both at short and long times , for which one could thus expect memory effects to be negligible , this factor is not small ( typically 5 , see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1d]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of our analytical predictions for the mean fpt traces back to the quantitative prediction for the trajectories in the future of the fpt @xmath24 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1d],[fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the strong dependence of @xmath24 on the starting point @xmath2 , predicted by our approach and confirmed numerically , is a direct manifestation of the non - markovian feature of the random walks . </S>",
    "<S> together , our results demonstrate and quantify the importance of memory effects in first - passage properties of non - markovian random walks in confined geometry .    </S>",
