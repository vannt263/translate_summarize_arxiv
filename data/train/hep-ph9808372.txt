    "the experimental sensitivity of the reaction @xmath2 to details of the @xmath3 model has been studied earlier (  @xmath4 and refs . quoted therein ) and also in a contribution to this workshop @xmath5 .",
    "it is well - known that the born cross section may be modified strongly by radiative corrections of the standard model .",
    "these effects have to be under definite control . for the annihilation channel ,",
    "the problem has been solved in @xmath6 where some of the notations used may be found .",

    ", this may be done following e.g. @xmath17 correct to order @xmath18 or e.g. @xmath19 in the leading log approximation ( lla ) .",
    "the term to be determined additionally is the @xmath20 interference .",
    "we have calculated the bremsstrahlung corrections in lla which is known to agree with the exact calculation within about 1  % or better .",
    "we took into account all the contributions which are discussed in  @xmath19 where also the notational details may be found .",

    "both the left - right asymmetries and the corrections to them are small since the symmetric pure photon exchange dominates .",
    "although the largest cross section corrections are due to bremsstrahlung ( especially at large @xmath45 ) , being followed by those due to the running @xmath41 , this is not true for asymmetries as is seen best from figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "there , the loop corrections dominate over bremsstrahlung .",
    "further , a closer inspection shows that the influences from a running @xmath41 and the weak form factor effects are of the same size and have equal sign . for comparison ,",
    "the curves from the standard model predictions are also shown .",
    "they are corrected by lla bremsstrahlung , by effects due to running @xmath47 and the weak form factors .",
    "as may be seen they behave such that a distinct experimental signal from a @xmath3 deserves a careful analysis of data .",
    "we conclude that in the analysis of experimental asymmetries all different origins of radiative corrections have to be carefully taken into account .",
