    "<S> we consider the quasispecies description of a population evolving in both the `` master sequence '' landscape ( where a single sequence is evolutionarily preferred over all others ) and the rem landscape ( where the fitness of different sequences is an indipendent , identically distributed , random variable ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in both cases , the error threshold is analogous to a _ first order _ thermodynamical transition , where the overlap between the average genotype and the optimal one drops discontinuously to zero .    </S>",
    "<S> an equation describing the behavior of populations of self reproducing entities , subject to natural selection and to mutations , was introduced by manfred eigen in 1971  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inheritable structure ( `` genotype '' ) of these entities is described by a sequence of length @xmath0 of symbols belonging to an alphabet of @xmath1 characters ( @xmath2 in the case of nucleic acids ) . in the simple case in which one such sequence is selectively preferred with respect to all others , </S>",
    "<S> eigen was able to show that his equation ( the _ quasispecies equation _ ) implies a transition ( called the _ error threshold _ ) between two different behaviors :    * at low mutation rate , the population is made up , at equilibrium , of sequences close to the preferred one ( _ master sequence _ ) : it forms therefore a _ quasispecies _ ; * at higher mutation rate , the distribution becomes uniform over sequence space .    </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is reminiscent of a phase transition in statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , i.  leuthusser  @xcite showed that the quasispecies equation is equivalent to a statistical mechanical model . </S>",
    "<S> the error threshold corresponds in this language to a thermodynamical transition of the statistical mechanical system .    </S>",
    "<S> later , tarazona  @xcite qualified this correspondence , by pointing out that the properties which described the behavior of the evolving population corresponded to </S>",
    "<S> _ surface _ </S>",
    "<S> observables of the statistical mechanical model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular he argued that in the simple situation mentioned above , with a single master sequence , while the naive application of statistical mechanics predicted a first - order phase transition , the transition was continuous for the evolutionary model . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between the two predictions was attributed to a surface phenomenon akin to wetting  @xcite , where the disordered state is favored on a surface layer whose thickness diverges as the phase transition is approached .    </S>",
    "<S> the statistical mechanics approach to the quasispecies equation was later used by franz et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to solve it in a `` rugged fitness landscape '' ( in which the selective value of each different sequence is an independent random variable ) modelled by derrida s random energy model ( rem )  @xcite . in this case , a first - order transition between the quasispecies and the uniform behavior was found . </S>",
    "<S> this result has been challenged by p. g. higgs and g. woodcock  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter is to point out that the discrepancy between predictions is due to the fact that one s attention is directed towards different observables in the different cases : a careful consideration of the `` infinite genome '' ( @xmath3 ) limit , necessary to obtain a sharp phase transition , shows that , in the `` master sequence '' model , the error threshold is a first - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this does not rule out the fact that , in the same limit , the fraction of individuals whose genotype is equal to the master sequence ( or , for that matter , is at any finite hamming distance away from it ) goes smoothly to zero at the transition . in particular , the `` wetting phenomenon '' described by tarazona does not take place , at least in this case . </S>",
    "<S> similar results hold for the rugged fitness landscape .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the @xmath4 `` master sequence '' model , defined as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the genotype @xmath5 is described by @xmath0 units @xmath6 , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the quasispecies equation , which describe the evolution of the fraction @xmath8 of individuals having the genotype @xmath5 at generation @xmath9 , takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the fitness of sequence @xmath5 and @xmath12 is the mutation matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization factor @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 the matrix element @xmath15 is the conditional probability that a reproduction event of an individual with genotype @xmath16 produces one with genotype @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> if one assumes pointwise mutations with uniform probability one has @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hamming distance between the sequences @xmath5 and @xmath16 , and @xmath19 is the mutation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the `` master sequence '' is denoted by @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the fitness @xmath11 is then given by @xmath21 in this expression , @xmath22 is a `` selective '' inverse temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen to take @xmath23 in order to obtain the infinite genome limit in close analogy with the thermodynamical limit . </S>",
    "<S> we shall discuss later the scaling considered by eigen  @xcite and followers , in which @xmath24    as pointed out by leuthusser and tarazona  @xcite , the solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qs ] ) can be expressed in terms of a statistical mechanical model . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a population evolving for @xmath25 generations from an initial condition in which @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> one has @xmath27.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have set @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and we have defined the normalization constant @xmath30 by @xmath31\\\\ & \\equiv&\\sum_{s(1),s(2),\\ldots , s(t-1),s(t)}\\exp(-h\\{s(t)\\}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last line defines the symbol @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> it now turns out that , for the `` master sequence '' model , @xmath33 where the `` mutation '' inverse temperature @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 the expression ( [ hamilton ] ) looks like the hamiltonian ( times the temperature ) of an ising system of @xmath36 spins , arranged in @xmath25 layers of @xmath0 spins each . </S>",
    "<S> the interlayer interactions , representing the correlation effects due to the heredity , are proportional to @xmath34 , while the intralayer interactions , representing the selection , are proportional to @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> tarazona  @xcite pointed out that the intralayer interaction term corresponding to layer @xmath25 is lacking in this expression : the system corresponds therefore to a statistical mechanical model with a free surface .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now easy to see that , in the limit @xmath38 followed by @xmath39 , a phase transition separates an ordered ( `` frozen '' ) regime in which one has @xmath40 for all layers @xmath9 except the last one , from a disordered ( `` free '' ) one , in which all sequences @xmath5 have the same probability , and the system behaves like a collection of @xmath0 independent one - dimensional ising models at temperature @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition line can be obtained by comparing the free energies @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 :    1 .   for the ordered regime one has @xmath44 2 .   for the disordered regime one has @xmath45 corresponding to the free energy per spin of a one - dimensional ising model </S>",
    "<S> .    the transition line is given by the condition @xmath46 ( where the boundary terms are neglected ) and reads @xmath47 in terms of the mutation rate @xmath19 , this corresponds to @xmath48 , as originally obtained by eigen  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now show in more detail that all layers but the last one ( corresponding to @xmath49 ) are  frozen \" for @xmath50 , in the sense that the only configurations which contribute in the infinite genome limit are those for which @xmath40 for @xmath51 . let us consider the last - but - one layer ( @xmath52 ) , and let us momentarily assume that the preceding layer is frozen . </S>",
    "<S> the last layer is free , because there are no contributions from the intralayer interactions at @xmath49  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are two possibilities for @xmath53 :    1 .    frozen \" </S>",
    "<S> : @xmath54 : this yields a contribution @xmath55\\times(2\\cosh\\beta)^l$ ] to the partition sum ; the second factor comes from the sum over the configurations of the last layer ; 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> `` free '' : summing also over the configurations of the last - but - one layer , one obtains the contribution @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> because one has , by hypothesis , @xmath57 , the first contribution dominates for @xmath38 . by induction , one can show in the same way that it is not possible that there is a label @xmath58 separating `` frozen '' layers ( for @xmath59 ) from `` free '' ones ( for @xmath60 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now define , following tarazona  @xcite , the order parameter @xmath61 as the overlap of the average sequence @xmath62 with the master sequence @xmath63 : @xmath64 the angular brackets denote the population average : @xmath65 where we have taken into account that @xmath66 .    in the ordered phase , all layers but </S>",
    "<S> the last one are frozen to the master sequence . </S>",
    "<S> it is then a simple matter to show that @xmath67 on the other hand , @xmath68 , obviously , in the disordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus obtained the result that the phase transition is of _ first order _ , and that @xmath61 drops discontinuously from @xmath69 to 0 as @xmath37 falls below the transition value @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> let us also remark that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ordpar ] ) predicts that @xmath68 for @xmath71 , even for @xmath72 , as it is reasonable to expect on intuitive grounds .    </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is supported by the numerical solution of the quasispecies equation for finite @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 the order parameter as a function of @xmath19 for different values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath37 is such that the error threshold takes place for @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> one clearly sees that the curve approaches a discontinuous behavior as @xmath0 increases , contrary to the statements contained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us remark that , properly speaking , the weight @xmath74 in the population approaches 0 in the thermodynamical limit ( @xmath38 , @xmath75 ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the population forms a _ bona fide _ quasispecies , in the sense of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> eigen  @xcite , leuthusser  @xcite , and tarazona  @xcite have considered a situation in which the fitness ratio @xmath76 is kept constant as @xmath0 increases . in this case , if the mutation rate @xmath19 ( and hence @xmath34 ) is kept constant , one eventually crosses over smoothly to a `` disordered '' regime , independently of the value of this ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this is the point that eigen wanted to make when he introduced the quasispecies equation , back in 1971 : that the error threshold prevented biological information to be maintained , if genome length exceeded a certain value .    </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , there is no sharp phase transition , and the question whether it be of first or second order is pointless . </S>",
    "<S> however , even in this case , one can obtain a phase transition in the limit @xmath38 , if one mantains constant the average number @xmath77 of mutations . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to take @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to solve the problem in this limit , and the results concide with what one obtains by taking the same limit in the equations we haver written above . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the transition is still of first order , but now the order parameter @xmath61 jumps from 1 to 0 : just above the transition , the _ whole _ population lies a finite hamming distance away from the master sequence ( even though the weight of the master sequence goes smoothly to zero ) .    on the other hand , this behavior does contradict the fact that the weight @xmath74 of the master sequence ( which does not vanish if @xmath19 is small enough ) approaches 0 _ continuously _ at the error threshold , as exhibited by fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the limit behavior is indeed given by  @xcite @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the total mutation probability , and @xmath81 is the corresponding transition value . </S>",
    "<S> however , even in the infinite genome limit , the whole population is the offspring of master sequence individuals at each generation , and has therefore a finite overlap with the master sequence , as soon as one is above the transition .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the rem fitness landscape . in this case the fitness @xmath11 is given by @xmath82 where the `` energies '' @xmath83 of different sequences are independent normally distributed random variables , with zero average and variance equal to @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> we have correspondingly @xmath85,\\ ] ] where , as before , we assume that @xmath86 corresponds to an energy minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk properties of this model have been studied in  @xcite with the replica method . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly illustrate here the results , using the argument originally developed by derrida to solve the rem  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> suppose to consider two neighboring layers , @xmath9 and @xmath87 , whose overlap @xmath88 , defined by @xmath89 has a fixed value . </S>",
    "<S> the average number of these configurations with energy equal to @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92.$ ] the typical value is equal to the average value if the latter is exponentially large , and vanishes otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus write for a typical sample : @xmath93.\\ ] ] this expression is dominated by the saddle point in the free phase , and by the smallest value of the energy ( and @xmath94 ) in the frozen phase . </S>",
    "<S> the typical value can be obtained by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nu ] ) , by setting @xmath95 , and is equal to @xmath96 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ fre ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the surface ( evolutionary ) properties can be worked out as in the `` master sequence '' case . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the frozen phase , and let us assume that layer @xmath99 is frozen into one of the rem ground states . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on layer @xmath100 and assume that layer @xmath25 is free . </S>",
    "<S> layer @xmath25 has then no influence on layer @xmath100 , whose contribution to the free energy is given by @xmath101 analyzing eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lyer ] ) as above , we find a freezing transition into the ground state , with the same conditions as for the bulk . therefore , as long as @xmath102 , all layers but the last one are frozen in the energy ground state . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear at this point that all along the frozen phase @xmath103 is independent of @xmath9 for @xmath104 , and is given by @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> in the same way the weight of the optimal sequence behaves as in the `` master sequence '' model .    summarizing </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that in the `` master sequence '' and in the rem landscapes for the quasispecies equation , in the limit in which one can speak of sharp phase transitions , surface phenomena do not appear . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the surface passively follows the behavior of the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the pathology of the model , that is one - dimensional in the time direction , but mean - field like in the sequence direction . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis also shows that `` master sequence '' and rem landscapes , apart from details , have very similar evolutive properties . </S>"
