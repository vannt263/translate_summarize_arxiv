    "it is well - known that one of the most interesting and challenging problems of general relativity is the energy and momentum localization .",
    "numerous attempts have been made in the past for a solution , and this problem still attracts considerable attention in the literature , and remains an important issue to be settled .",
    "the different attempts at constructing an energy - momentum density do nt give a generally accepted expression .    related on the method that used the energy - momentum complexes we can say that there are various energy - momentum complexes including those of einstein [ 1]-[2 ] , landau and lifshitz [ 3 ] , papapetrou [ 4 ] , bergmann [ 5 ] , weinberg [ 6 ] and mller [ 7 ] . also , there are doubts that these prescriptions could give acceptable results for a given space - time .",
    "the problem is that with different energy - momentum complexes we can obtain different expressions for the energy associated with a given space - time .",
    "this is because most of the energy - momentum complexes are restricted to the use of particular coordinates .",
    "but the results obtained by several authors [ 8]-[9 ] demonstrated that the energy - momentum complexes are good tools for evaluating the energy and momentum in general relativity .",
    "although , the energy - momentum complexes of einstein , landau and lifshitz , papapetrou , bergmann and weinberg are coordinate dependent they can give a reasonable result if calculations are carried out in quasi - cartesian coordinates .",
    "some interesting results sustain this conclusion .    on the other hand , mller",
    "[ 7 ] constructed an expression which enables one to calculate the energy distribution in any coordinate system not only in quasi - cartesian coordinates . also , lessner in his important work [ 10 ] pointed out that the problem lies with the interpretation of the result from a special relativistic point of view instead of a general relativistic one . in conclusion ,",
    "the mller prescription can be used with success to evaluate the energy distribution of a given space - time .",
    "many results recently obtained [ 11 ] support the conclusion given by lessner in his recent paper that the mller definition is a powerful concept of energy and momentum in general relativity .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the energy distribution of some stringy black hole solutions in the mller prescription .",
    "we study the energy associated with these solutions because we think they can furnishes us interesting results .",
    "we have three cases .",
    "the first case is that of the dual solution known as the magnetic black hole solution .",
    "the metric is obtained by multiplying the electric metric in the einstein frame by a factor @xmath0 . in the second case",
    "we consider the metric which describes a non - asymptotically black hole solution in dilaton - maxwell gravity and was given by chan , mann and horne [ 13 ] .",
    "first , we perform the calculations for the string metric ( see kar [ 13 ] ) . in the last case we study the string metric for the magnetic black hole ( kar [ 13 ] ) . the mller energy - momentum complex gives us consistent results for these three situations . through the paper we use geometrized units ( @xmath1 ) and follow the convention that latin indices run from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the low energy effective theory largely resembles general relativity with some new  matter  fields as the dilaton , axion etc [ 13]-[14 ] .",
    "a main property of the low - energy theory is that there are two different frames in which the features of the space - time may look very different .",
    "these two frames are the einstein frame and the string frame and they are related to each other by a conformal transformation ( @xmath4 ) which involves the massless dilaton field as the conformal factor . the string",
    " sees  the string metric .",
    "many of the important symmetries of string theory also rely of the string frame or the einstein frame [ 15 ] .",
    "the action for the einstein - dilaton - maxwell theory is given by    @xmath5 .",
    "\\label{1}\\ ] ]    varying with respect to the metric , dilaton and maxwell fields we get the field equations for the theory given as    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    the metric ( in the string frame ) which solve the einstein - dilaton - maxwell field equations to yield the electric black hole is given by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 .    in the string frame the dual solution known as the magnetic black hole is obtained by multiplying the electric metric in the einstein frame by a factor @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the magnetic black hole metric is given by    @xmath12    with @xmath13 .",
    "recently , some non - asymptotically flat black hole solutions in dilaton - maxwell gravity are due to chan , mann and horne [ 12 ] .",
    "the metric of the solution in the einstein frame is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 .",
    "the string metric is obtained by performing the usual conformal transformation on the metric .",
    "this turns out to be    @xmath16    with @xmath17 .",
    "the string metric for the magnetic black hole is given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 .",
    "we think that another important and challenging problems related to these black hole solutions is that of their energy distributions .",
    "we consider that a good manner to evaluate the energy associated with a black hole solution in string theory in the one which used the mller energy - momentum complex [ 7 ] .",
    "this is because of the above mentioned important results obtained in the mller prescription and , also , of the lessner opinion [ 10 ] and cooperstock very important hypothesis [ 16 ] .    in the following",
    "we present the definition of the mller energy - momentum complex .",
    "its good properties indicates it as a good tool for energy - momentum localization in general relativity .",
    "as we pointed out above , mller gave an expression which allows us to perform the calculations in any coordinate system .",
    "also , mller argued that his expression enables one to obtain the same values for the total energy and momentum as the einstein energy - momentum complex for a closed system .    the mller energy - momentum complex @xmath20 [ 14 ]",
    "is given by    @xmath21    where",
    "@xmath22    the quantity @xmath23 is the mller superpotential and satisfies the antisymmetric property    @xmath24    @xmath25 is the energy density and @xmath26 are the momentum density components .    also , @xmath20 satisfies the local conservations laws    @xmath27    the energy of the physical system in a four - dimensional background is given by    @xmath28    using the gauss theorem we get the energy contained in a sphere of radius @xmath29 .",
    "we have    @xmath30    first , we consider the dual solution in the string frame which is the magnetic black hole described by the metric given by the ( 6 ) . for this solution the non - zero @xmath23 components of the mller energy - momentum complex are given by    @xmath31    now , we use ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) and we obtain the for the energy distribution the expression    @xmath32    in the fig.1 we give the graphic representation of the energy .",
    "@xmath33 is plotted against @xmath29 on x - axis and @xmath34 on y - axis . for the mass @xmath35",
    "we get the value @xmath36 .        from ( 17 ) it results that the energy depends on the mass @xmath35 and charge @xmath34 .    for the solution described by the metric given by",
    "( 8) we get the non - zero @xmath37 components of the mller energy - momentum complex    @xmath38    with ( 15 ) and ( 18 ) we have for the energy    @xmath39    in the fig.2 @xmath33 is plotted against @xmath29 on x - axis and @xmath34 on y - axis . for the mass @xmath35 and @xmath40",
    "we get the values @xmath36 and @xmath41 .",
    "we observe from ( 19 ) that the energy distribution depends on the mass @xmath35 , charge @xmath34 and @xmath40 .    in the case of the magnetic black hole given by ( 9 )",
    "we obtain the non - vanishing @xmath23 components of the mller energy - momentum complex    @xmath42    using ( 15 ) and ( 20 ) we obtain for the energy distribution    @xmath43    in the fig.3 we have the graphic representation of the energy .",
    "@xmath33 is plotted against @xmath29 on x - axis and @xmath34 on y - axis .",
    "for the mass @xmath35 and @xmath44 we get the values @xmath36 and @xmath41 .        from ( 21 )",
    "it results that the energy depends on the mass @xmath35 , charge @xmath34 and @xmath40 .",
    "the subject of the localization of energy continues to be an open one since einstein has given his important result of the special theory of relativity that mass is equivalent to energy .",
    "misner et al [ 17 ] sustained that to look for a local energy - momentum means that is looking for the right answer to the wrong question .",
    "also , they concluded that the energy is localizable only for spherical systems . on the other hand , cooperstock and sarracino [ 18 ]",
    "demonstrated that if the energy is localizable in spherical systems then it is also localizable in any space - times .",
    "bondi [ 19 ] gave his opinion that  a nonlocalizable form of energy is not admissible in general relativity , because any form of energy contributes to gravitation and so its location can in principle be found  .",
    "also , chang , nester and chen [ 20 ] showed that the energy - momentum complexes are actually quasilocal and legitimate expression for the energy - momentum .",
    "they concluded that there exist a direct relationship between energy - momentum complexes and quasilocal expressions because every energy - momentum complexes is associated with a legitimate hamiltonian boundary term .",
    "even the method of localization of energy with several energy - momentum complexes has many adepts there was , also , many criticism related to the use of the energy - momentum complexes in energy and momentum localization .",
    "the main lack of the energy - momentum complexes is that most of these restrict one to calculate in quasi - cartesian coordinates .",
    "as we pointed out above , in introduction , the most energy - momentum complexes are dependent on the coordinate system .",
    "only the mller energy - momentum complex allows us to make the calculations in any coordinate system .",
    "another argument that sustains the use of the mller prescription is the lessner [ 10 ] conclusion that the mller energy - momentum complex is a powerful representation of energy and momentum in general relativity .",
    "the viewpoint of lessner [ 10 ] is that  the energy - momentum four - vector can only transform according to special relativity only if it is transformed to a reference system with an everywhere constant velocity .",
    "this can not be achieved by a global lorentz transformation  .",
    "in this paper we choose to study the energy associated with some stringy black hole solution [ 13 ] because those solutions are interesting to study .",
    "we obtain results for three stringy black hole solutions in the string frame . the energy of the magnetic black hole , which is the dual solution in the string frame , in eq .",
    "( 17 ) is @xmath45 .",
    "our result show that the total energy is dependent on charge @xmath34 and differs to previous investigations .",
    "it shows us that the stringy black holes in string frame are interesting for study .",
    "the total energy of the other two non - asymptotically flat black hole solutions , in eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) , become infinite . from eqs . ( 19 ) and ( 21 ) we found out that the mller energy - momentum complex furnishes us consistent results of non - asymptotically flat black hole solutions .",
