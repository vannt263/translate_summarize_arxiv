    "during the past two decades , several developments in theoretical nuclear research have allowed significant improvements in the microscopic description of nuclear collisions @xcite . such is the case of nucleon scattering , where continuous efforts have led to detailed microscopic realizations of optical model potentials , thus providing the most complete current first - order nonrelativistic description of nuclear collisions off nuclei over a wide energy range and various targets .",
    "these calculations emphasize a detailed treatment of the nn effective interaction , particularly its density dependence as well as its energy and momentum dependence .",
    "quite generally , however , all realizations of the optical potential become a single expression in the form of a convolution of medium - dependent effective interactions folded with the target ground - state mixed density . in this article",
    "we demonstrate that the optical potential can be expressed as the sum of two very distinctive terms , one of them depends exclusively on the free - space @xmath0 matrix and the other as a gradient of the reduced @xmath1 matrix .",
    "this result implies that intrinsic medium effects in optical potentials become enhanced in the nuclear surface and suppressed in the saturated volume .    since the early realizations of microscopic optical potentials @xcite",
    ", the role of nuclear medium effects has been a major issue in the study of the dynamics involved in nucleon - nucleus collisions . in these studies",
    "density - dependent nucleon - nucleon local ( _ nn _ ) effective interactions have been developed to represent the force between nucleons in the nuclear medium .",
    "the use of these local forces , with suitable local density prescriptions , have led to folding optical potentials in coordinate space which provide reasonable descriptions of _ na _ scattering data at energies between a few tens of mev up to near 400 mev .",
    "recent developments @xcite , within the same philosophy , have succeeded in including non localities in the optical potential stemming from the exact inclusion of the exchange term . in this case the full mixed density from nuclear shell models are used and provide reasonable account of the existing _ na _ scattering data .",
    "a slightly different strategy has been followed by arellano , brieva and love ( abl ) , with the realization of folding optical potentials in momentum space @xcite . in their approach",
    "genuine nonlocal @xmath1 matrices , based on the brueckner - bethe - goldstone infinite nuclear matter model , are folded to the ground - state local density of the target . as a result",
    ", nonlocal potentials are obtained with varying degree of success in describing the low and intermediate energy data .",
    "the inclusion of medium effects has also been addressed within the spectator expansion @xcite , where the coupling between struck nucleons and target spectators is taken into account .",
    "this approach is an extension of the watson , and kerman , mcmanus and thaler theories , with focus is on the many - body propagator involved in the ( a+1)-body problem .    from a more general prospective ,",
    "various formal expressions of the optical potential can be found in the literature @xcite . although they may differ in the way they establish contact with the bare _ nn _ potential , they all become a folding expression between the target ground state and a generalized two - body effective interaction . in this article",
    "we analyze this general expression and demonstrate that , regardless of the model of utilized to represent the effective interaction , the intrinsic medium effects become manifest in the nuclear surface .",
    "the implications of this result are examined in the framework of an infinite nuclear matter model for the _ nn _ effective interaction .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we outline the general framework , discuss the structure of two - body operators and introduce the ` asymptotic separation ' for spherically symmetric systems . the result",
    "is then applied to the unabridged optical potential in momentum space . in section",
    "iii we make use of an infinite nuclear matter model for the effective _ nn _ interaction and examine its implications in the optical potential .",
    "furthermore , we analyze its consistency with the abl approach , and assess the medium sensitivity of selected matrix elements at various energies . in section",
    "iv we present a summary and the main conclusions of this work .",
    "additionally , we have added three appendices where we include some intermediate steps .",
    "a general representation of the optical model potential for collisions of a hadronic probe with kinetic energy @xmath2 off a composite target is given by the expression @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents a two - body effective interaction containing , in general , information about the discrete spectrum of the many - body system .",
    "the one - body mixed density @xmath5 represents the ground - state structure of the target .",
    "thus , a fully consistent evaluation of the optical potential by means of the full @xmath4 matrix would require the solution of the @xmath6-body system , a formidable task .",
    "this difficulty is circumvented by treating separately the ground state and the two - body effective interaction .",
    "this separation becomes suitable at intermediate and high energies , where the discrete spectrum of the many - body green s function is distant from the projectile energy in the continuum .",
    "then , the target ground - state may be described resorting to alternative framework such as hartree - fock - bogoliubov .",
    "the effective interaction , in turn , can be modeled using the brueckner - bethe - goldstone approach .",
    "let us first focus our discussion on the two - body effective interaction and examine its structure .",
    "quite generally , the representation of the two - body operator @xmath4 in either momentum or coordinate space requires the specification of four vectors .",
    "we denote the coordinate representation of @xmath4 in the form @xmath7 where the ` prior ' coordinates of each particle are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . similarly , @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to the ` post ' coordinates of the same particles , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fourv]a ) .",

    "( [ fourv]b ) . with this transformation",
    "we express the equivalence @xmath15 thus , following the procedure outlined in appendix [ twobody ] we express the momentum space elements @xmath16 , in the form @xmath17\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 represents the reduced interaction at the local coordinate @xmath19 . here",
    "we have denoted @xmath20 the prior total and relative momenta , respectively .",
    "the same construction applies to the post momenta , where prime marks are used .",
    "the relationship between these momenta is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fourm ] ) .",
    "( [ wigner ] ) for @xmath21 also expresses the role of vector @xmath19 , @xmath22 the center of gravity of the four coordinates of the two particles .",
    "we name this the _ local coordinate _ , the _ locus _ where the reduced interaction is evaluated . notice that this coordinate is invariant under the permutation of coordinates @xmath23 .    the above representation of the @xmath4 matrix displays very clearly its dependence in terms of the total ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and relative ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) momenta .",
    "additionally , the wigner transform in the @xmath14 and @xmath28 coordinates restricts further the structure of @xmath29 , suggesting the definitions    @xmath30    the vector @xmath31 represents the total momentum gained by the pair upon interaction ( @xmath32 ) , whereas @xmath33 is the average of the prior and post total momenta . these momenta become perpendicular only if @xmath34 .",
    "we now examine the structure of @xmath21 in the context of a finite nucleus with spherical symmetry . by",
    "that we understand that @xmath35 depends only on the magnitude of the local coordinate , @xmath36 .",

    "if we omit the three vector arguments of @xmath35 and decompose it as @xmath39 , then @xmath40 carrying out the solid angle integration , the integrand of the remaining radial integral is simply @xmath41 , which integrated by parts yields the asymptotic separation @xmath42 \\phi_1(z\\,w_\\perp)\\ ; \\frac{\\partial g_z}{\\partial z}\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath43 denotes the dirac delta function and @xmath44 represents the profile function defined by @xmath45 with @xmath46 the spherical bessel function of order 1 . in fig .",
    "( [ profile ] ) we plot @xmath44 , where we observe that its peak value ( 1/3 ) occurs at the origin , and that it is mainly contained within the region @xmath47 .    what is interesting about eq .",
    "( [ theresult ] ) is that it separates unambiguously the free - space contribution of the @xmath4 matrix from its medium - dependent counterpart . on the one hand ,",
    "the medium dependence enters solely as the gradient of the reduced element while the total momentum is not conserved . on the other hand ,",
    "the medium - independent contribution does conserve momentum , as dictated by @xmath48 .",
    "this contrast is physically consistent with our notion about non - translational invariant systems . by introducing a @xmath49-dependent reduced interaction ,",
    "the two - body @xmath4 matrix does not expresses conservation of the total momentum .",
    "the conservation becomes manifest only if @xmath50 , as in the cases of interacting nucleons in infinite nuclear matter or free space .",
    "more interestingly , the result displayed by eq .",
    "( [ theresult ] ) is sufficiently general to allow us to model the medium dependence in a finite nucleus and justifies the incorporation of medium effects in distorted wave born approximations ( dwba ) .    the application of the asymptotic separation in eq .",
    "( [ omp ] ) for @xmath51 yields some undisclosed features .",
    "let us first change variables from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , @xmath54 so that @xmath55 .",
    "these two vectors represent the mean and transferred struck - nucleon momenta , and the integration on them accounts for the fermi motion of the target nucleons .",
    "analogously , let us denote @xmath56 so that @xmath57 . with this notation we re -",

    "spherical mass distribution reduces the dimension of non trivial integrals to seven ( 6 + 1 ) . ]",
    "optical potential takes the form @xmath61 with    @xmath62    the first term , @xmath63 , depends exclusively on the medium - free reduced matrix , whereas the second depends on the gradient of @xmath1 .",
    "in the preceding analysis we have made no mention to a specific approach to model the @xmath4 matrix . in this regard ,",
    "the framework is general enough to include various strategies to describe an effective two - body interaction in the realm of a finite nucleus .",
    "however , if the reduced matrix @xmath1 is taken @xcite as the antisymmetrized brueckner - bethe - goldstone reaction matrix of starting energy @xmath2 , @xmath64 then the reduced matrix at infinity , @xmath38 , corresponds to the free scattering matrix @xmath65 . in the above equation @xmath66 and @xmath67",

    "if the reduced matrix is evaluated at a density @xmath72 specified by the local coordinate @xmath19 , then @xmath73 considering that @xmath74 peaks in the nuclear surface , the intrinsic medium - dependent contributions to the optical potential become accentuated in that region .",

    "we have multiplied this function by @xmath78 to account for its actual weight in the radial integration .",
    "what becomes clear from this figure is that medium effects stemming from @xmath79 become dominant ( if non zero ) in the region between 5.5 fm and 9 fm . in this range",
    "the local fermi momentum @xmath80 varies between 0.3 @xmath81 and 1.2 @xmath81 , suggesting the densities at which the @xmath1 matrix needs to evaluated .",
    "the abl approach to the optical potential constitutes an extension of the early full - folding approach based on the free @xmath0 matrix @xcite .",
    "this extension makes use of an infinite nuclear - matter model to represent the _ nn _ effective interaction between the projectile and the target nucleons . upon the use of a simplifying assumption regarding its relative momenta dependence , and resorting to the slater approximation of the mixed density , the optical potential takes the form of a folding of the diagonal ( local ) density with a nonlocal fermi - averaged @xmath1 matrix .",

    "( [ unabridged ] ) for _ elastic scattering _",

    "the unabridged optical potential discussed here represents elastic processes and its extension to inelastic scattering would require further analysis .      the actual evaluation of the unabridged optical potential [ c.f .",
    "( [ unabridged ] ) ] constitutes a very challenging task beyond the scope of this work .",
    "indeed , each matrix element requires the realization of a 7-dimensional integration , three more dimensions than current calculations in the abl approach .",
