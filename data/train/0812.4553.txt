    "@xcite the lifetime of spin - wave excitations can exceed a couple of hundreds nanoseconds , and the spin - wave propagation path reaches a few centimeters .",
    "the surface magnetostatic waves @xcite ( wave propagation direction is perpendicular to the magnetic field applied in the film plane ) and the forward magnetostatic waves @xcite ( external field is oriented perpendicular to the film plane ) were previously studied theoretically and experimentally in such periodical structures @xcite .    in our recent paper",
    "@xcite we presented the first experimental and theoretical results on scattering of backward volume magnetostatic waves ( wave propagation direction is parallel to the magnetic field applied in the film plane ) @xcite from an one - dimensional structure with periodic changes of the yig film thickness .    in the present paper",
    "we present a detailed study of this kind of magnonic crystal .",
    "its main characteristics , such as insertion loss in the rejection bands , parasitic loss in the transmission bands , and the frequency bandwidth of the rejection bands , were investigated for crystals having different groove depths , widths , and groove numbers .",

    "anisotropic etching can be clearly seen .    in order to excite and receive the dipolar spin waves , two microstrip antennas",
    "were placed 8 mm apart , one in front of the grating , and one behind it ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) .",
    "a bias magnetic field of 1845oe was applied in the plane of the yig film stripe , along its length and parallel to the direction of spin - wave propagation . under these conditions ,",
    "backward volume magnetostatic wave ( bvmsw ) propagation occurs .",
    "a continuous - wave microwave signal was applied from a network analyzer ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) to the input antenna , and bvmsw transmission characteristics were measured .",
    "the microwave signal power was maintained at 1mw in order to avoid any non - linear processes .",
    "in a general case , a theoretical description of the scattering of dipole spin waves from inhomogeneities is given by a singular integral equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dynamic magnetization , @xmath13 is the microwave field of the input antenna , @xmath14 is the green s function of dipole magnetic field , and @xmath15 is the tensor of the microwave magnetic susceptibility which depends on the spin - wave carrier frequency @xmath16 and on the magnetic parameters of the film .",

    "however , according to this formula , the reflection should decrease with increasing @xmath25 , which is in contradiction with the experimental results presented here ( see section iv ) .",
    "thus a more detailed model is necessary .    to build a more appropriate model",
    ", we first notice that the quasi-1d dipole field @xcite of the lowest bvmsw thickness mode decays within a distance of a few film thicknesses from its source . because the width of the grooves @xmath27 is much smaller than @xmath28 , the spin wave travels as an eigenmode of a continuous film of thickness @xmath26 through most of the lattice ( _ i.e. _ between grooves ) . for the sections where the thickness is @xmath26 the integral equation reduces to a simple formula ( see eq .",
    "( 50 ) in @xcite ) which shows that between the grooves , the transmitted and reflected waves only accumulate phase and decay ( due to intrinsic magnetic damping ) .",
    "thus , in order to describe the formation of stop bands , one has to consider the scattering of a bvmsw from just one groove .",
    "the effect of multiple consecutive grooves is obtained by cascading the structure period using matrices of scattering t - parameters and taking interference effects into account .",
    "the most direct way to proceed is to solve this two - dimenstional singular integral equation numerically to obtain the scattering characteristics of a bvmsw scattering from a single groove .",
    "however this work is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "another way to treat scattering from a single groove was previously suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our short paper @xcite",
    ", we adapted this method to the case of a bvmsw . for completeness , we reproduce our theory here , but in more detail .",
    "we first consider the grating as a periodical sequence of sections of regular transmission lines with different propagation constants ( different spin - wave wavenumbers ) for the same carrier frequency .",
    "we neglect the fact that the groove edges are oblique , and consider the groove cross - section as a rectangle with the same depth and having the same area . in order to describe spin",
    "wave transmission through the magnonic crystal we use t - matrices which describe the relation between the amplitudes of the wave incident onto an inhomogeneity and reflected from it @xcite .",
    "the t - matrix @xmath32 for a section of unstructured film ( section of film between neighboring grooves ) of length @xmath33 has diagonal components only : @xmath34 where @xmath25 is the spin - wave wavenumber in the unstructured film , @xmath35 is the rate of the spin - wave spatial damping , @xmath36 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath37 is the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth , and @xmath38 is the spin - wave group velocity .    similarly , the t - matrix @xmath39 for a regular spin - wave film waveguide with a thickness @xmath40 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the spin - wave damping rate for the groove .",
    "here we use the fact that the bvmsw dispersion law for small wavenumbers @xmath43 is practically linear .",
    "therefore , the spin - wave wavenumber in the grooves is @xmath44 . to describe the loss increase in the pass bands with increasing groove depth",
    ", we introduce an empirical parameter @xmath45 which accounts for larger contribution of two - magnon scattering processes in the areas which underwent anisotropic etching @xcite",
    ". then the damping rate in the grooves can be expressed as @xmath46 .    at the edges of the grooves the incident wave",
    "is partially reflected back .",

    ", one has to specify the form of the reflection coefficient @xmath60 .",
    "the model we suggest is based on the analogy of the change in the film waveguiding properties to a change in the characteristic impedance @xmath61 of a microwave transmission line @xcite .",
    "the expression for the complex reflection coefficient for a junction of two microwave lines with characteristic impedances @xmath62 and @xmath61 can be written as @xcite :",
    "@xmath63 we assume that the change of the characteristic impedance of a spin - wave waveguide arising from the change of yig - film thickness is due to a change of the film s effective inductance .",
    "then the characteristic impedance is linearly proportional to the propagation constant ( to the spin - wave wavenumber in our case ) , and we obtain a formula for the reflection coefficient for a wave incident onto the edge of a groove from the unstructured section of the film : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a phenomenological parameter introduced in this formula to account for eventual factors which were not taken into account in this simplistic model .    for the wave incident onto the same junction in the reverse direction , @xmath66 , which has already been taken into account in the expressions for the t - matrices above .",
    "the expression @xmath66 means that the wave phase change due to reflection from one and another edge of groove is @xmath67 .",
    "the experimental bvmsw transmission characteristics for the unstructured film and for the magnonic crystals with @xmath8  =  300 , 600 and 900 nm measured with a network analyzer are shown in fig .",

    "the bvmsw transmission characteristic for the unstructured film has a maximum just below the point of ferromagnetic resonance .",
    "one sees that the insertion loss is @xmath68  db and is determined by the energy transformation efficiency by the input and the output antennas and by the spatial decay of spin waves during their propagation in the space between the antennas . as bvmsw frequency band is bounded above by the ferromagnetic resonance frequency no spin - wave propagation occurs for higher frequencies . with decreasing frequency the bvmsw excitation and reception efficiencies drop .",
    "this drop is due to the finite width of the antennas in the direction of bvmsw propagation .",
    "thus for very low and very high frequencies , no spin waves can be excited and the insertion loss ( @xmath69  db ) is determined by the direct electromagnetic leakage from the input to the output antenna . a small separate peak at the right - hand edge of the transmission characteristic is due to excitation of the first width standing mode of film @xcite .    in order to remove the influence of the antennas and of the spin - wave spatial decay we calculate the difference between the logarithms of the transmission characteristics for the unstructured and the structured films .",
