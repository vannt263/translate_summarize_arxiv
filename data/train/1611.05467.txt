    "paper considers a _ common - receiver reconstructions ( crr ) _ variant of the _ successive refinement _ problem with receiver side information where the source reconstructions at the receivers are required to be identical ( almost always ) .",
    "an encoder is required to compress the output of a discrete memoryless source ( dms ) into two messages :    * a _ common _ message that is reliably delivered to both receivers , and * a _ private _ message that is reliably delivered to one receiver .",
    "each receiver has some side information jointly correlated with the source ( and the other receiver s side information ) , and is required to output source reconstruction that meets a certain fidelity requirement .",
    "the crr condition requires that these reconstructions be identical to one another .",
    "the crr problem described above can be viewed as an abstraction of a communication scenario that could arise when conveying data ( e.g. , meteorological or geological survey data , or an mri scan ) over a network for storage in separate data clusters storing ( past ) records of the data .",
    "the records , which serve as side information , could be an earlier survey data or a previous scan , depending on the specific application .",
    "the framework considered here is the source coding problem that arises when data is to be communicated over a degraded broadcast channel to two receivers that have prior side information , and the three terminals ( the transmitter and the two receivers ) use a separate source - channel coding paradigm  @xcite .",
    "the problem of characterizing the _ achievable rate - distortion region _ of the general successive refinement problem with receiver side information is open  @xcite .",
    "the version of the successive refinement problem where the private message is absent , known as the heegard - berger problem , is also open  @xcite .",
    "however , complete characterization exists for specific settings of both successive refinement and heegard - berger problems .",
    "for example , the rate region of the successive refinement problem is known when the side information of the receiver that receives one message is a degraded version of side information of the other receiver  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the heegard - berger problem has been solved when the side information is degraded  @xcite , mismatched degraded  @xcite , or conditionally less noisy  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the hb problem has also been solved under list decoding constraints ( closely related to logarithmic - loss distortion functions )  @xcite , degraded message sets  @xcite , and many vector gaussian formulations  @xcite .",
    "the common reconstruction variant of the wyner - ziv problem was first motivated and solved by steinberg  @xcite .",
    "common reconstructions in other problems were then considered in  @xcite .",
    "benammar and zaidi recently considered the hb problem under a three - way common reconstructions condition with degraded message sets  @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we characterized the rate region for several cases of the hb problem with the crr requirement . in this work",
    ", we present single - letter inner and outer bounds for the rate region of the successive refinement problem with receiver side information and the crr requirement ( termed as the sr - crr problem ) . for several specific cases of the underlying joint distribution between the source and the side information random variables ( including those in our previous work  @xcite ) , we prove that the inner and outer bounds match , and therefore yield a characterization of the rate region .",
    "the characterization indicates that while the receiver side information can be fully utilized for reducing the communication rate by means of binning , only the gcs - krner common randomness between the random variables ( i.e. , both auxiliary and side information ) available to the two receivers can be used for generating the reconstructions .",
    "this feature is also seen in our characterization for the hb problem with the crr requirement in  @xcite .",
    "this single - letter characterization for the rate region of the sr - crr problem derived in this work is _ unique _ in the sense that it is the first rate region formulation where the gcs - krner common randomness explicitly appears in the single - letter constraint corresponding to the receiver source reconstructions . unlike the best - known bounds for the successive refinement problem , the characterization of the sr - crr rate region ( when the source satisfies a certain support condition ) requires only one auxiliary random variable that is decoded by both receivers .",
    "thus , the crr requirement obviates the need for a second auxiliary random variable to absorb the private message .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec - n ] introduces some basic notation ; section  [ sec : gacs - korner ] reviews the concept of gcs - krner common randomness ; and section  [ sec - pd ] formally defines the successive refinement problem with the common receiver reconstruction constraint .",
    "the characterization of the paper s main contributions are summarized in section  [ sec - newresults ] , including the single - letter characterization of the rate region , and the proof of the discontinuity of the characterization with the source distribution .",
    "the reader will be directed to the respective appendices for the proofs of the results contained in section  [ sec - newresults ] .",
