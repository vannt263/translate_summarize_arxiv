    "it is known that the composite quantum system states , for example bipartite ones , are described by density operators @xmath6 which provide the possibility to construct reduced density operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 which describe the states of the subsystems 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "recently it was observed @xcite that the quantum properties of systems without subsystems can be formulated by using invertible map of integers @xmath9 onto the pairs ( triples , etc ) of integers @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "namely , the state density operator @xmath12 of system without subsystems , e.g. the state of single qudit @xmath13 can be mapped onto density operator of the system containing the subsystems , ( e.g. the state of two qudits ) @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we have passibility to translate known properties of quantum correlations associated with structure of bipartite system like entanglement to the system without subsystems .",
    "it is worthy to note that the quantum correlations , similar to correlations analogous to entanglement for the single qudit were found and formulated in terms of quantum contextuality in @xcite .",
    "the aim of our work is to develop the remark presented in @xcite where the state of single qudit with @xmath0 was suggested to be studied in the aspect of entanglement existing in bipartite system of two qubits .",
    "we introduce @xmath14-state and construct for density matrix @xmath15 of qudit with @xmath0 the analogs of qubit reduced density matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we define the separability and entanglement properties of the density matrix @xmath15 using the invertible map @xmath18 .",
    "all the density matrices are matrices of the operators , calculated in the corresponding bases .",
    "for example in the case of qudit with @xmath0 the basis is defined as set of vectors @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and these vectors are eigenvectors of the operator @xmath21 .",
    "the operator @xmath21 acting in four - dimensional hilbert space of the qudit state has the eigenvectors , i.e. @xmath22 . in the case of two qubits",
    "the basis in four - dimensional hilbert space of the system states is defined as the set of vectors @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "these vectors are eigenvectors of two commuting operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the four - dimensional matrices of these two operators in the described basis have only diagonal nonzero matrix elements .",
    "the elements read @xmath27 .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 has the nonzero matrix elements in basis @xmath19 as follows : @xmath29 .",
    "the matrices @xmath28 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 commute . in view of this , the corresponding observables can be measured simultaneously .",
    "we study the corresponding properties of the qudit and two - qubit systems in parallel .",
    "we define the separability and entanglement of the qudit with @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain the explicit formulas for von neumann entropy and information and derive the entropic inequalities for @xmath14-states of the qudit with @xmath0 .",
    "let us define the density matrix of qudit state with spin @xmath0 .",
    "this matrix has the form @xmath32 and has the properties @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix are nonnegative .",
    "let us introduce an invertible map of indices @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . applying this mapping to the density matrix @xmath15 one can write @xmath39 if @xmath40 then the density matrix has the view of two - qubit @xmath14-state density matrix @xmath41 where @xmath42 are real positive and @xmath43 complex quantities .",
    "in fact if we will apply the map @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 to the matrix elements of the new matrix will have view of two - qubit density matrix . the latter matrix has the unit trace and is nonnegative if @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the eigenvalues of are ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath50 the reduced density matrices are defined as @xmath51 hence the von neumann entropies can be obtained as @xmath52 and the quantum information is defined as @xmath53 obviously , the quantum information satisfies the inequality @xmath54 . hence @xmath55 the subadditivity condition holds for the qudit system with @xmath0 and this single qudit system does not contain subsystems .",
    "using the map of density matrix of two - qubit system onto density matrix for state of qudit with @xmath0 we define analog of positive partial transpose operation known for bipartite system states to the single - qudit state .",
    "we get the matrix @xmath56 with eigenvalues @xmath57 in the case where the following inequality holds @xmath58 we will interpret the sum in the left hand side of this inequality as negativity parameter characterizing the state of qudit with @xmath0 .",
    "we interpret the qudit state with matrix satisfying the inequality as entangled state .",
    "it is known that @xmath14-state of two qubits is entangled if either @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "both conditions ca nt be fulfilled simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the concurrence is defined as @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the square - roots of the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath63 in decreasing order .",
    "we use the definition of concurrence which is analogues to concurrence for two - qubit system .",
    "the matrix @xmath64 is obtained by spin flip operation on the qudit density matrix @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a pauli matrix and @xmath67 hence is @xmath68 multiplying matrices and we get @xmath69 the eigenvalues of the obtained matrix are @xmath70 hence , it can be deduced that the concurrence is determined by ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath71",
    "as en example of @xmath14-state density matrix of qudit state with spin @xmath0 can be taken the following two - parametric matrix @xmath72 to provide the positivity of the parameters are @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the eigenvalues of are the following @xmath75 after ppt the matrix is @xmath76 to provide the positivity of is must be @xmath77 .",
    "the area where matrix is nonnegative is shown in figure [ fig:1 ] . with solid lines",
    "are shown lines @xmath78 , @xmath79 , with dashed @xmath80 , @xmath80 .",
    "intersection of the domains @xmath74 and @xmath77 are shown as gray area .",
    "dark gray triangle is the area where @xmath81 ( entanglement state ) .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath82 must be entirely fall into a gray area . in figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "are shown two kinds of parameters @xmath82 . with the dashed line @xmath83 which falls entirely in the area where the density matrix is nonnegative .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 goes beyond this area at the point @xmath85 that is shown with the dotted line .",
    "( dashed line ) is full in gray area , @xmath84 ( dotted line ) is partly in gray area ]     ( dashed line ) is full in gray area , @xmath84 ( dotted line ) is partly in gray area ]    the eigenvalues of are the following @xmath86 the negativity is defined as @xmath87 and concurrence is @xmath88 the and are shown in figure [ fig:3 ] for parameter @xmath83 and looks completely like for two - partite system concurrence and negativity . for parameter @xmath84 that is not completely in area where is nonnegative",
    "the negativity and concurrence are shown in figure [ fig:4 ] . in area",
    "@xmath89 the density matrix is not nonnegative and and are not valid .    ]    ]    there are tsallis @xcite and renyi @xcite entropies depending on extra parameter q and they are called @xmath90-entropies . the classical @xmath90-entropies for @xmath91 are @xmath92 the introduced @xmath90-entropies can be considered as entropy of `` two - qubit '' composite system . in view of this",
    "the entropy of the qudit with @xmath0 has to satisfy the relations which are known for the state of the two - qubit system .",
    "we study these inequalities in future publication .",
    "to conclude we point out the main results of our work which present the extension of the approach used in @xcite .",
    "we introduced and studied the @xmath14-state of qudit with @xmath0 .",
    "we obtained the entropic inequalities for the single qudit with @xmath0 which are analogs of the inequalities for the composite system of two qubits .",
    "we developed approach of @xcite and used notion of separability and entanglement of single qudit state which is the state of a system without subsystems .",
    "the concurrence and negativity were introduced in our work to characterize the degree of entanglement of the single qudit with @xmath0 .",
