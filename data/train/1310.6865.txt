    "we find that all three objects do not show contribution from agns and prove to be consistent with starbursts .",
    "even for q2352@xmath60028 which only has a limit from the  @xmath2 6583/  ratio , the result indicates that it is consistent with expectations for star - forming galaxies with no apparent agn contamination or shock ionisation .        in the local universe ,",

    "jones et al . ( 2010 ) measure strong , negative gradients at z@xmath32 suggesting that if z @xmath32 starbursts evolve into spiral discs today , then the gradients must flatten by 0.050.1 dex / kpc over the last 810gyr . furthermore , the high - redshift spiral galaxy metallicity gradient of yuan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) is consistent with inside - out disc formation model .",
    "more recently , swinbank et al . (",
    "2012 ) have reported metallicity gradients in unlensed systems at 0.84@xmath8z@xmath82.23 which are negative or consistent with zero , with an average @xmath60.027@xmath70.005 dex / kpc , which is comparable with the slope seen in the thick disc of the milky - way .",
    "the authors find that all three isolated galaxies have negative gradients , while the merging system has a positive gradient .",
    "in fact , only a few positive gradients have been measured , all of which are relatively shallow ( @xmath9 0.05 dex / kpc ) .",
    "positive metallicity gradients have been claimed for some high redshift galaxies , most of them with no signs of recent interaction or merging .",
    "cresci et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and queyrel et al . (",
    "2012 ) have suggested they could be caused by high accretion rates of metal - poor gas onto the nucleus which occur only at high - redshift or during mergers .",
    "queyrel et al . (",
    "2012 ) argue that these inflows are preferably due to interactions whereas cresci et al .",
    "( 2010 ) relate them to cold flows .",
    "queyrel et al . (",
    "2012 ) also claim evidence for gas inflow and metallicity gradient flattening in close pairs and interacting galaxies .",
    "these authors point to a transition period at z@xmath312 between cold accretion ( at high - redshift ) and mergers ( at lower - redshift ) in the growing process of massive galaxies .",
    "these reported inverted gradients are puzzling since we know it is difficult to form a positive gradient given the fraction of gas converted into stars per unit time must increase with radius , while the dynamical time - scale generally decreases with radius .",
    "the corollary is that a higher fraction of metal - enriched gas must be lost to outflows at small radii .",
    "positive gradients for interacting systems may be a signature of the redistribution of the metal - rich gas produced from a central starburst ( werk et al .",
    "2010 ; rupke , kewley & chien 2010 ) , or possibly as a result of inflow of relatively unenriched gas from the halo ( or igm ) if it is able to intersect the central regions of the disc galaxy without being disrupted .",
    "another explanation is an increasing contribution of shocks at large radius rather than a positive metallicity gradient ( kewley et al . 2010 ) .",
    "we now know how merging processes affect the metallicity gradients : the gradients flatten immediately after first close pass ( barton , geller & kenyon 2003 ; kewley , geller & barton 2006 ) .",
    "the metallicity in mergers can be used as a signpost of first pericentre passage ( kewley et al .",
    "models of kobayashi ( 2004 ) predicts that in the case of monolithic collapse , there will be steep metallicity gradient which shows no time evolution . on the contrary ,",
    "major mergers are expected to flatten the metallicity gradient with signs of an evolution with time .",
    "therefore , the gradient evolution with redshift is related to the radial size growth predicted by models . recently , swinbank et al .",
    "( 2012 ) reproduced their observed metallicity gradients with predictions for the gas discs of star - forming galaxies in the cosmologically based hydrodynamic simulations . in these models",
    ", the inner disc undergoes initial rapid collapse and star - formation with gas accretion ( from the halo and/or igm ) depositing relatively unenriched material at the outer disc , causing negative abundance gradients . at lower redshift ( when gas accretion from the igm is less efficient )",
    "the abundance gradients flatten as the outer disc becomes enriched by star - formation ( and/or the redistribution of gas from the inner disc ) .",
    "we note however that m101 is an important exception to this description , being at low - redshift but with a strong gradient ( kennicutt , bresolin & garnett 2003 ) .",
    "the systems discussed in this paper are part of a larger group of galaxies observed with sinfoni . for three of",
    "the absorbing - galaxies observed in that sample , we have built 2d metallicity maps based on  detection .",
    "the map of the system towards q1009@xmath60026 is presented in proux et al .",
    "( 2011a ) and the ones for q0452@xmath61640 and q2352@xmath60028 studied here are presented in proux et al .",

    "therefore , the internal gradients of metallicity with radius of these three objects are flat or at most weakly negative for two of the three systems .",
    "these estimates are in line with the gradients reported in the local universe .",
    "for the local galaxy gradients , the isolated spiral control sample of rupke , kewley & chien ( 2010 ) indicates a median slope of @xmath60.041@xmath70.009 dex / kpc .",
    "the median slope of gradients from that sample is consistent with the values of zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra ( 1994 ) and van zee et al .",
    "( 1998 ) samples .",
    "the zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra ( 1994 ) gradient sample is composed of 39 local disc galaxies , and the van zee et al .",

    "local early - type galaxies have even shallower gradients ( henry & worthey 1999 ) .",

    "it is therefore important to be able to compare these two metallicity indicators both in the local universe and at high - redshift .    in the milky way , the oxygen abundances in orion s  regions ( bautista & pradhan 1995 ) are in good agreement with those measured from uv absorption lines in the local interstellar medium ( moos et al .",

    "lebouteiller et al .",
    "( 2009 ) studied a sample of low metallicity galaxies and find that abundances in neutral gas are equal or lower than in the ionised gas and confirm a plateau below which metals are not found .",
    "we note that these results seem to put into question the reliability of  regions to be a good tracer of the ism metallicity , but the difference in abundance between the neutral and ionised gas may be a by - product of the sample selection . other studies at z=0 are underway ( james et al .",
    "2011 ) for 9 galaxies based on acs and cos observations .",
    "the authors find that overall the  abundances are similar to those in  region except for n , higher in  regions , ( suggesting enrichment in  regions by wolf - rayet stars ) .",
    "the oxygen metallicity in  and  agree well .",
    "early results indicate that the difference between distinct gas phase are smaller towards the nucleus of the galaxies probably because there is more efficient mixing .",

    "in all three cases , the metallicity derived for the  gas is slightly lower than the one measured in the ionised gas .",

    "while these gradients are spanning different physical scales , they agree within the admittedly large error bars .",
    "this suggests that neutral gas abundances are good tracers of the metallicity of a galaxy .",
    "since the internal gradient within the ionised gas aligns well with the gradient between the ionised gas in the nucleus to the neutral gas in the halo , one can assume that the latter is an acceptable proxy of the former .",
    "however , this assumes that the chemical evolution of the neutral gas mirrors that of the ionised gas , i.e. that a gradient in the neutral gas also exists .",

    "the degree of dust extinction in star - forming regions can also be estimated from the balmer lines of hydrogen , because these strong optical lines have intrinsic ratios that are well described by atomic theory . under the assumption of case b recombination ( osterbrock 1989 ) and for t",

    "calzetti ( 2001 ) demonstrates that , in local star - forming galaxies , the stellar continuum suffers less reddening than the ionised gas , expressed as @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , calzetti ( 2001 ) suggests that the reddening of the balmer lines in nearby uv - selected starbursts is better described by a foreground dust distribution and traditional milky way extinction curve ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) . on the other hand , erb et al .",

    "the evidence for extinction are weak ( frank & proux 2010 ; khare et al .",
    "2012 ) , which is possibly a limitation intrinsic to the sdss survey and quasar - selection itself ( noterdaeme et al .",
    "2009 ) .    here",
    ", we use the detection of both  and  in the absorbing - galaxy to compute the balmer decrement , which can allow us to infer the dust extinction by comparing balmer line ratios to their predicted values via atomic physics .",
    "the colour excess can be computed from the following equation :    @xmath18    these values are the intrinsic / , and k(@xmath2 ) is derived assuming an extinction curve of the smc at wavelength @xmath2 .",

    "thus , the gas directly in front of the quasar appears to have different dust properties than the absorbing - galaxy s gas probed at the line of sight in our emission - line spectroscopy . in the case of the object towards q2352@xmath60028 ,",

    "a more robust approach to an estimate of the reddening from the measure of the quasar continuum slopes has to come from a statistical approach to overcome the inherent difference from one object to another ( murphy & liske 2004 ; york et al .",

    "<S> , we present observations covering 300 nm to 2.5 @xmath1 m of emission line spectra of three of these absorbing - galaxies using the long - slit spectrograph x - shooter on the vlt . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to compare the neutral and ionised phase metallicities in the same objects and relates these measures to possible signature of low - metallicity gas accretion or outflows of gas enriched by star formation . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the abundances derived in absorption along the line - of - sight to background quasars are reliable measures of the overall galaxy metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to a comparison of abundances in different phases of the gas , a potential observational consequence of differences in fueling mechanisms for disc galaxies is the internal distribution of their chemical abundances . </S>",
    "<S> we present some evidence for small negative metallicity gradients in the three systems . </S>",
    "<S> the flat slopes are in line with the differences observed between the two phases of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that a comparison of the  and  metallicities is a robust indicator of abundance gradients in high - redshift galaxies and do not favour the presence of infall of fresh gas in these objects .    </S>",
