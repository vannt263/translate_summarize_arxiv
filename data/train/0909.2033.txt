    "berry phase phenomena are known to be wide - spread , intriguing , and useful in controlling quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the wilczek - zee variation , in which different eigenstates sharing a degeneracy are turned into each other after the cyclic variation of environmental parameter @xcite , is found particularly useful , since it supplies the basis for so - called holonomic quantum computing @xcite . whether such state transformations require the existence of degeneracy throughout the parameter variation , is a matter in need of further analysis , although it has been the wide - spread assumption .",
    "the exotic holonomies are defined as exchange of eigenstates after one period of cyclic parametric evolution without any relevant degeneracy .",
    "they have been found in time - periodic systems @xcite and in singular systems @xcite , but not in finite hamiltonian systems up to now .",
    "one obvious reason is that the two real numbers in a real axis can not be continuously exchanged without colliding with each other , i.e. degeneracy .",
    "note that in a time periodic system described by a unitary matrix , its eigenvalues are complex number on the unit circle in the complex plane so that the eigenvalues smoothly exchange their position without crossing over each other .",
    "once level crossing is allowed during the variation of environmental parameter , even in hamiltonian system there is a possibility of the eigenlevels being exchanged after the cyclic parameter variation even among non - degenerate levels , which would be instrumental in enlarging the resource for holonomic quantum control .",
    "it appears that this is related to a myth that adiabatic parameter variation excludes level crossing , and therefore , there is no possibility for exotic quantum holonomies for non - singular hamiltonian system .",
    "an argument often raised against systems with level crossing is that it is not generic , and it represents a set of measure zero in parameter space of all systems .",
    "however , systems of our interest often lives in a world with some symmetry , exact or approximate . under certain circumstances ,",
    "a system can always pass through the point of symmetry when an environmental parameter is varied along a circular path .",
    "then , the level crossing become a common feature rather than an exception .",
    "surprisingly , it has been known for quite sometime that the adiabatic theorem is extendable to the case of crossing levels @xcite .",
    "the eigenstates change smoothly as functions of environmental parameter even when the level crossing takes place , and this opens up the possibility for eigenvalue holonomy for non - singular hamiltonian systems . in this article",
    ", we explicitly construct such models , which seem to have immediate extension to @xmath0 level cases .",
    "the solvability of our model allows us to examine the analytic structure of the gauge potentials , which is known to be the mathematical origin behind the existence of exotic holonomy @xcite .",
    "consider a hamiltonian system with an environmental parameter , which we call @xmath1 .",
    "we assume , for the moment , that the eigenvalues @xmath2 and eigenstates @xmath3 are non - degenerate for all possible values of the parameter .     and",
    "@xmath4 represent energy gaps.,width=188 ]    let us suppose two levels very closely approach each other at a certain value of the parameter , which can be thought of as an avoided crossing with the closest energy gap @xmath5 .",
    "let us further assume that the two levels are separated apart from the next closest level ( see fig .",
    "1 ) by @xmath4 . consider a smooth cyclic variation of @xmath6 with a period @xmath7 , namely , @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , we require that @xmath6 starts smoothly at the beginning @xmath9 and stops gently at @xmath10 @xcite to ensure the applicability of the landau - zener formula @xcite .",
    "let us assume that we have inequalities , @xmath11 the period @xmath7 is small enough compared with the inverse of the energy gap @xmath5 so that the levels completely cross over the gap during the parametric variation , while it is large enough to ignore any transition among levels except the interacting two levels considered here , which is the reason why we call this process adiabatic .",
    "the situation remains intact even when the levels do cross according to some exact symmetry , @xmath12 , instead of showing avoided crossing .",
    "in fact , although a tiny avoided crossing caused by a slight symmetry - breaking takes place , the afore mentioned adiabatic level cross - over is robust irrespective of small parametric perturbation .",
    "this is the physics behind the so - called _ adiabatic level crossing",
    "once such an adiabatic level crossing occurs , there is no reason to assume that each quantum eigenstate should come back to the corresponding initial state after a cyclic parametric variation .",
    "only requirement is that the entire set of eigenstates should be the same as before , since the solutions of eigenvalue equation with a given parameter are uniquely determined .",
    "it is thus allowed that the two levels are exchanged after the parametric variation . with a parameter @xmath1 , which describes the cyclic parametric variation along the path @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 satisfying @xmath16 , such a transition is described by the holonomy matrix @xmath17 as @xcite @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 represents the path - ordering and anti - path ordering of operator integrals , the @xmath22 is the non - abelian gauge potential @xmath23 and @xmath24 its diagonal reduction @xmath25 the dynamical phase @xmath26 depends on the precise history of the parameter variation , while the holonomy matrix @xmath17 is solely determined by the geometry of the path @xmath13 in the parameter space .",
    "non - zero off - diagonal component of @xmath17 , if any , signifies the existence of exotic holonomy .",
    "physical requirement that an eigenstate does not split with adiabatic parameter variation limits the form of @xmath17 to be permutation matrix supplemented by possible manini - pistolesi off - diagonal phases @xcite for each non - zero elements .",
    "namely , there is only a single non - zero entry to each raw and each column , and the absolute value of this entry is one .",

    ". the exotic holonomy also seems to have resemblance to the off - diagonal holonomy of manini and pistolesi .",
    "it is important to point out that the eigenstates are obtained independently from the choice of envelope function @xmath30 .",

    "the eigenstate holonomy , occurring now at the midpoint of the new full cycle @xmath186 , is nothing but the off - diagonal holonomy discussed by manini and pistolesi . in the off - diagonal holonomy ,",
    "the set of eigenstates at the starting value of environmental parameter `` accidentally '' coincides with that at another value of parameter in a midpoint of cyclic evolution . in general ,",
    "such coincidence is highly unlikely , and it is often a result of the same hamiltonian multiplied by different numbers appearing at different value of environmental parameter . in such a case , with the introduction of new envelope function and reinterpretation of the period of parameter variation , a system with off - diagonal holonomy can be mapped to another one with exotic holonomy . in this instance , the manini - pistolesi holonomy _ is _ the exotic holonomy in disguise .",
    "our findings can be placed in context by considering a standard double - cone structure of energy surface standing on the parameter space , whose connected apices of two cones represent berry s diabolical point .",
    "when the parameters are varied along a circle that surrounds the diabolical point , berry phase arises ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m10 ] , left ) .",
    "we can ask a question : what will happen when the circle touches the diabolical point .",
    "obviously , the trajectory on the energy surface should be `` smooth '' , and it wanders both cones . with a cyclic variation of parameters , the trajectory moves from one cone to the other .",
    "this is exactly the hamiltonian exotic holonomy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m10 ] , right ) .",
    "this process is fully described by holonomy matrix given in terms of the path - ordered integral of the gauge potential just as in the case of berry phase .",
    "the gauge potential now has singularities in complexified parameter space , not on the diabolical point itself .",
    "the hamiltonian exotic holonomy can be viewed as an extension of , and a natural complement to the berry phase , and it forms an integral part of physics of adiabatic quantum control .",
    "the general equation for quantum holonomy ( [ mhol ] ) is just a very natural expression of the basic requirement that the entire set of eigenstates is to be mapped to itself after the cyclic variation of environmental parameter .",
