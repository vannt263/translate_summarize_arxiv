    "quantum algorithm shows us a tempting future to conquer some problems that are hard to solve using classical computers@xcite , such as , factorizing large numbers@xcite , searching in a large database@xcite , and so on .",
    "however , the physical realization of a quantum computer turns out to be a really difficult work .",
    "the greatest obstacle is the decoherence of system induced by unavoidable coupling with the surrounding environment@xcite .",
    "since quantum devices work in a microscopic scale , their interactions with the environment become fatal to the quantum coherence of the system .",
    "someting has to be done to increase the decoherence time so as to complete enough operations within so short a peroid of time .",
    "therefore , error correcting code ( ecc ) is needed@xcite . with the help of ecc",
    "a small error rate can be tolerated .",
    "howerver , since the necessary error - rate threshold still lies far beyond the present available technology , other methods to fight against error should be considered .",
    "one promising method is topological quantum computation ( tqc ) @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "topological order@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite is a new kind of quantum order .",

    "the degeneracy of the ground state closely relates to the topology of the physical system ( usually 2-dimensional ) .",
    "2 .   the system is immune to local perturbation and this property can be used to protect qubits .",

    "much has been discussed about the fibonacci anyons that can be used for tqc directly in quantum hall effect .",
    "however it is hard to control anyons in real quantum hall systems . besides , kitaev proposed a spin-1/2 honeycomb model@xcite , which seems achievable , followed by some different possible physical implementations@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the work in ref.@xcite proposed a more sophisticated method for the anyon detection process .",

    "recently , kou showed how to do computations in the toric code model by using the tunneling effect theoretically @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "however , the original toric code model calls for four - body interaction , which is hard to implement in real systems .",
    "the josephson junction seems to one of the candidates to implement a realistic quantum computation @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    "we discuss how to do computations based on their work in the next section .",
    "now we recount some basic properties of their model in detail first .",
    "these properties are essential for the construction of computation gates . for the convenience of the computation we talk about",
    ", we make a small modification with the boundary and discuss further the quasiparticle excitation , especially the vortex , which agrees , in essence , with the original model .",
    "first , we give the basic building element and explain how it works .",
    "then we show how the array is arranged and give the dynamics of the system . finally , we talk about the topological degeneracy of the ground space and the low - lying excitations .",

    "the classical potential is shown on the right .",
    ", width=115,height=86 ]    as shown in fig.[potential ] , the basic building block is a rhombus made of a four - junction superconducting loop placed in a magnetic field . the flux through the rhombus is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the flux quanta .",
    "we require that all the josephson junctions are the same and work in the `` phase regime '' , that is , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this system , as is much discussed in the literature , forms a simple two - level `` flux qubit '' ( or persistent - current qubit)@xcite@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we briefly explain how the qubit system emerges .",
    "we denote the phase of the superconductor islands with @xmath5 .",
    "the josephson system is described with the lagrangian @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity in the cosine term is the the gauge - invariant phase difference across each junction .    here",
    ", we make an approximation that three of the junctions have the same phase difference .",
    "as all phase differences should sum up to @xmath8 , we get @xmath9 where @xmath10 indicates the phase difference between the two far ends of the rhombus . neglecting the kinetic part , this energy has two equivalent classical minima at @xmath11 ( as shown in fig.[potential ] ) , that is , the phase difference across each junction is @xmath12 .",
    "so the two classical ground states correspond to states in which there are both clockwise and counterclockwise supercurrents in the loop .",
    "this is the reason why we call it a persistent - current qubit .",
    "we denote the two states as @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "quantum fluctuation makes the electron tunnel between the two classical states in the wells and that splits the degenerate ground states .",
    "the low - energy configuration can be regarded as a two - level qubit system .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the classical action taking the path between the two minima .",
    "the value of tunneling energy is estimated regarding the potential as quadratic .",
    "let us see what happens when the condition is slightly changed from the ideal .",
    "notice that the dynamics require that the flux through the rhombus is _ exactly _ half a flux quanta .",
    "if the external flux is a bit different from the ideal value , @xmath18 , we add a first order change to the potential , @xmath19 as a result of the slight change of the flux , the two minima of the double well are no longer degenerate but separated by a gap @xmath20 .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian is @xmath21 .",
    "this is important for operations .",
    "we can control the evolution of the system by adjusting the flux through the rhombus .",
    "below , in the josephson array building from the basic rhombi , logical qubits are encoded for computation .",
    "some gate operations are done just by the method of tuning the flux of the rhombi along specific paths .",
    "the array is punctured with several holes .",
    "the number of the holes relates to the degeneracy of the ground space .",
    "the boundary , as shown in the lower figure and indicated by a ( blue ) solid line , is a whole superconductor wire connecting all the rhombi along the boundary .",

    "the flux through the polygon loops on the boundary are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    now we have got the bricks we need . in this part",
    "we show how to build the josephson array system .",
    "the basic rhombi are arranged as shown in fig.[array ] . for simplicity ,",
    "a rhombus is indicated by a short line in the figure .",
    "six rhombi form a hexagon .",
    "the array is placed in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "we should carefully tune the shape of the rhombi , so that the flux through the hexagram in the center is a half - integer multiple of @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the centers of the hexagons are denoted with @xmath26 and so on and individual rhombi between the corresponding two centers with @xmath27 .... the array contains @xmath28 holes .",
    "soon we will show that , in fact , each hole can be treated as a single logical qubit .    in the array , the rhombi form loops ,",
    "so we should check the gauge - invariant condition over again . to satisfy the constraint condition for all the closed loops in the array ,",
    "the sum of the phase differences around each hexagon should equal @xmath29 [ i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "this is well consistent with the configuration that all the @xmath31 of the six rhombi on the edges of a hexagon take the ground - state value @xmath32 ( or all take @xmath33 ) .",
    "the flip of a single rhombus is not allowed because it changes the sum of the phase differences around the loop by @xmath34 and violates the constraint .",
    "however , we can flip rhombi of an even number in a hexagon at the same time ( e.g. , two , four or six ) . choosing the two ground states as a basis , we can write the constraint in the operator form , @xmath35 the product takes the rhombi on the hexagon loops .    because of the existence of the constraint , the rhombi embedded in the array can no longer behave as in eq.([rhoh ] ) , which does not commute with the constraint .",
    "the simplest dynamics compatible with constraint contain flips of three adjacent rhombi , @xmath36 , such that two rhombi flip at the same time in the corresponding three hexagons .",
    "this gives the main contribution to the hamiltonian of the system @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is estimated to be analogous to @xmath39 in the last section .",
    "the action in the exponential term is three times of that of a single rhombus because of the simultaneous flip of the three rhombi .",
    "now we talk about the boundary .",
    "we should treat it carefully .",
    "the boundary here is arranged a bit differently from ioffe s original model .",
    "different boundary conditions of the toric code have been discussed in detail@xcite . in the system considered here , similarly , the boundary is arranged more like the `` rough edge '' .    here",
    ", we arrange the boundary rhombi in such a way that they behave like those in the bulk , as described by eq.([aryh ] ) .",
    "each rhombus on the boundary still stays close to the other two .",
    "a superconductor line connects the unattached rhombi at the outer and inner boundary ( like the blue line in fig.[array ] ) .",
    "the geometry of the polygon loops on the boundary should be carefully treated .",
    "a boundary loop has @xmath40 rhombi , usually three or four .",
    "we want to maintain the dynamics and constraint of the form as before , that is , two rhombi must flip at one time .",
    "so the flux embedded should be consistent with the sum of the phase differences of the @xmath40 rhombi , i.e. , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is an integer . then the hamiltonian eq.([aryh ] ) is still kept for the rhombi on the boundary .",
    "we complete the construction of the josephson array and give the low - energy dynamics . in the following section",
    ", we will discuss the properties of the ground - state space and excitations in detail .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the properties of the ground space and excitations .",
    "the topological degeneracy of the ground space can be used to encode logical qubits for computation .",
    "we show two kinds of quasiparticles in the system , charge and vortex .",
    "we can operate qubits by controlling their motion in the array .",
    "first , let us find the ground state of the system . ignoring the constraint",
    ", we can easily get the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ aryh ] ) as @xmath43 .",
    "of course , it is illegal and incompatible with the constraint .",
    "we can project it into the physical space with the help of an operator @xmath44 @xmath45 is a ground state of the system , but not the only one .    to find all the ground states",
    ", we can turn to the help of a path operator @xmath46 where @xmath47 takes the big ( red ) loop in fig.[array ] . notice that all the @xmath48 with the paths homotopic with @xmath47 are equivalent .",
    "also it is easy to check that @xmath49 commutes with both @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "so obviously @xmath52 is another ground state of @xmath50 . noting that @xmath53",
    ", we can construct all the ground states @xmath54 here , the product contains all the @xmath28 `` basic loops '' ( i.e. , loops around each single hole ) .",
    "note that in the representation above , @xmath55 .",
    "so we can interpret @xmath49 as the operator measuring the `` spin '' direction of the @xmath56th hole .",
    "we will utilize this physical meaning of @xmath49 for encoding in the next section .",
    "now we find the whole ground space of the array system with @xmath28 holes .",
    "the dimension of the ground space is just @xmath57 .",
    "it is interesting that the degeneracy correlates with the topology of the system .",
    "this is why it is called topological degeneracy .",
    "we can encode @xmath28 qubit in this space and do computations in it .",
    "based on the knowledge of the ground space , let us study the low - lying excitations of the system .",
    "an open string product of @xmath58 , which is compatible with the constraint , excites two `` charges '' at the two ends of the string . with the help of the anti - commutation relation with the hamiltonian , after a simple algebra computation",
    ", we can deduce that the energy of each single `` charge '' is @xmath59 above the ground .",
    "unfortunately , a string product of @xmath60 is not allowed by the constraint , which is different from the case in toric code model@xcite . to get another type of excitation",
    ", we should break the constraint eq.([constraint ] ) and contemplate the problem from the original lagrangian of the array .",
    "approximately , we only keep the degree of freedom of the superconductor islands at the two ends of the rhombi ( i.e. , at the vertices of the hexagons ) .",
    "correspondingly , we use the modified potential eq.([rhou ] ) .",
    "then the lagrangian of the array is @xmath61 where @xmath62 . taking the continuum limit ,",
    "the josephson array system can be mapped to a type - ii superconductor@xcite .",
    "a vortex solution exists in the system , taking one flux quanta .",
    "the energy of a single vortex is @xmath63 here , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the length between the two centers of the hexagons .",
    "vortices stay at the hexagons where the constraint is broken .",
    "the dynamics there are changed correspondingly .",
    "there is one kind of dynamic that interests us most , the single flip of a rhombus . to get this kind of dynamics",
    ", we carefully change the flux of two adjacent hexagrams to integer multiples of @xmath24 .",
    "two vortices appear and stay here .",
    "single flip happens only at the rhombus between the two hexagons .",
    "since the other rhombi stay close to the hexagons that satisfy the constraint , the single flip is still not allowed .",
    "this is also the reason why we must change the flux of two adjacent hexagons , but not one or two separated hexagons .",
    "if we change the flux of only one hexagon , we still can not get the single flip because it is forbidden by the adjacent hexagon .",
    "now we can add a @xmath60 term to @xmath66 with the amplitude @xmath39 at the rhombus between the two adjacent vortices . or rather",
    ", we can interpret it in such a way that two vortices with each energy @xmath67 are excited by a @xmath60 operation .",
    "this term is important for operations that we will discuss later .",
    "so we have got two types of quasi - particle excitations in the array .",
    "after all the discussions about the properties of the array we focus , in this section , on the computation process . it was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that motion of quasi - particles along topologically non - trivial paths changes the state .",
    "we care about how to achieve it . in this section ,",
    "we show how to encode logical qubits in the array , and propose an exact method to operate qubits in lab .    however , first we give a short review of stabilizer code formalism .",
    "in fact , this system can be regarded as stabilizer code .",
    "then we show how the topological degenerated ground space is protected from local noise .",
    "logical qubits are encoded in the `` holes '' .",
    "the spin directions of holes can be used to denote the state of the @xmath28 logical qubits .",
    "finally , we show how to implement the single qubit and multi - qubits operations .",
    "stabilizer code is developed as a general theory of quantum error - correction code@xcite . in this formalism",
    ", @xmath68 physical qubits are used to encode @xmath28 logical qubits ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "certain types of errors can be detected and corrected so that the reliability of quantum computation is greatly improved .",
    "first , we define the pauli group @xmath70 on @xmath68 qubits as @xmath71 where @xmath72 are integers .",
    "@xmath70 contains all the @xmath68-body pauli operators with coefficients @xmath73 .",
    "note that any two elements in the pauli group either commute or anti - commute with each other .",
    "a subgroup @xmath74 of @xmath70 is called a _ stabilizer group _ if there exists a nontrivial space @xmath75 stabilized by @xmath74 , @xmath76 it can be proved that @xmath75 is @xmath57-dimensional if the group @xmath74 has @xmath77 independent generators .",
    "we denote the stabilizer group as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is one of the @xmath77 generators of the group .",
    "the elements in @xmath74 are called _ stabilizer operators _ , or just _",
    "stabilizers_.    @xmath28 logical qubits are encoded in the stabilized space @xmath75 . to correct errors",
    ", we should first notice that the effects of errors can be represented by the one - body elements in the pauli group @xmath70 , because errors are usually local .",
    "when no error happens , after measuring all the stabilizers in @xmath74 ( just measuring all the @xmath77 generators is ok . ) , all results are 1 .",
    "assume one error , denoted by @xmath80 , happens , so that the original computation state @xmath81 is changed to @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath83 anti - commutes with at least one stabilizer in @xmath74 , e.g. , @xmath84 , the measurement of @xmath84 gives the result @xmath85 , then we know the error type and we can correct it by corresponding operation . however , there may exist some elements in @xmath86 that also commute with all the elements in @xmath70 .",
    "this type of errors can not be detected or corrected .",
    "the basis of logical qubits should be written out for computation .",
    "we can always find @xmath28 operators @xmath87 from @xmath86 such that @xmath88 form an independent operator set .",
    "@xmath87 plays the role of a logical operator @xmath89 .",
    "the logical computational basis @xmath90 is actually the state stabilized by the group @xmath91 the logical @xmath92 can be also found from @xmath86 satisfying :    1 .",
    "@xmath93=0 $ ] and 2 .",
    "@xmath94 .",
    "we emphasize here that the logical operator set @xmath95 is not unique .",
    "also , we did not limit @xmath87 to be of some certain form such as a product of several @xmath58 .",
    "it can be a mixed product of @xmath58 and @xmath60 , or even a product that contains only @xmath60 .",
    "the only condition required is that @xmath88 form an independent operator set .",
    "for example , suppose we find a set @xmath96 that satisfies the condition and @xmath97 is the set of corresponding logical flipping operators , it is easy to check that @xmath98 is also an independent set .",
    "so the status of logical sets @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the same , and their roles can be exchanged .      in this section ,",
    "we show how to encode logical qubit in the topological protected array . as an example",
    ", the toric code is a kind of stabilizer code .",
    "the computation is done in the ground space of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the star and plaquette operators .",
    "the ground space is stabilized by the operators @xmath102 .",
    "the loop products of @xmath60 and @xmath58 along two directions give rise to the logical gate @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "but toric code model only encodes two logical qubits .",
    "if we want to encode more qubits , we have to implement a much too complex boundary condition for more genus . in our system with puncture topology",
    ", we can see that encoding is much easier .",
    "we can write down the stabilizers in our considering model , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the physical ground space satisfying @xmath109 constitutes the protected code space .",

    ", we can see that the product of @xmath60 around the @xmath56th hole ( i.e. , @xmath49 mentioned earlier ) , actually plays the role of logical operator @xmath110 .",
    "we have mentioned that eigenvalues @xmath111 of @xmath110 can be regarded as the spin values of the @xmath56th hole .",
    "we can also find the logical operator @xmath112 as the product of @xmath58 along the path from the outer boundary to the inner of the @xmath56th hole ( the yellow lines connecting the right hole to the outer boundary in fig.[array ] ) .",
    "@xmath112 flips the spin of the @xmath56th hole to the opposite direction",
    ".    it may feel strange that we take the loop product of @xmath60 as logical @xmath113 while taking the string product of @xmath58 as logical @xmath114 .",
    "we should notice that the string product of @xmath60 is not allowed by constraints at the two ends of the string . on the other hand",
    ", although we can exchange the roles of @xmath114 and @xmath113 as mentioned earlier , the representation we chose here has a better physical meaning as `` spin '' .",

    "we emphasize again that all the homotopic paths are equivalent .     around the @xmath56th hole measures the direction of its flux .",
    "the state shown is @xmath116 .",
    ", width=272 ]    now we show why the code space is protected against local noise .",

    "@xmath119 is a set of orthogonal basis of the ground space @xmath120 , as discussed in the last section .",
    "there must exist at least one @xmath121 that anti - commutes with @xmath117 , so @xmath122 is driven outside @xmath120 and @xmath118 is zero .",
    "only perturbations of an order higher than @xmath68 take effect , such that @xmath68 pauli operators form a topologically nontrivial path across different boundaries , or form a loop embedding at least one hole .",
    "when @xmath68 is large enough , the system can be well protected and this is the reason why it is called topologically protected .    when it is cooled to a low enough temperature ,",
    "the system arrives at the protected ground space automatically .",
    "the computation is well protected from local noises . however",
    ", proper perturbations can drive quasi - particles tunnel through nontrivial paths , and this can be used to construct quantum gates .",
    "we will do computations by this method in the following part .",
    "we showed how the computation basis for logical qubits are represented .",
    "now let us see how to implement quantum gate operations in this system .",
    "from the discussion of the system previously , we know that quasi - particles are excited by pauli operators .",
    "the product operators of @xmath60 and @xmath58 along topologically non - trivial paths change the state of the system .",
    "so we get a more physical picture that the transmission of both charge and vortex changes the state .",
    "this can be used for operation in this section .    to complete the qubit gates operation ,",
    "we use a method similar to kous@xcite .",
    "we change the external magnetic field .",
    "effectively , the ground space behaves as a pseudo - spin system .",
    "we can see that it just drives the quasi - particles to tunnel through different sectors .    as an example",
    ", we slightly tune the flux of the rhombi along a path from the @xmath56th hole to the outer boundary . according to the previous discussion ,",
    "perturbations of the @xmath58 form appear in the single - rhombus hamiltonian , and this is allowed by the constraint .",
    "so we get the hamiltonian @xmath123    confined in the degenerate ground space .",

    "so we get the effective hamiltonian of the array as @xmath128 .    in this process ,",
    "a charge tunnels across the array from the @xmath56th hole to the outer boundary .",
    "degenerated states split just as in the case in the double - well of a single rhombus .",

    ". however , as mentioned before , this is not allowed by the constraint under ideal condition .",
    "something more should be done .",

    "similar to eq.([split ] ) , we get the energy splitting @xmath132 so we have got @xmath133 .",
    "as we known , any single - qubit rotation can be written as @xmath134 we have got both @xmath135 and @xmath136 , then we can get any single qubit gate , at least in principle .",
    "we can tune the corresponding flux of rhombi or hexagons and get the effective hamiltonian we need , carefully control the evolution time of the system ( that is to tune the parameters @xmath137 above ) , then we can construct any single qubit gate we want .    .",
    "this gives the effective hamiltonian @xmath138 .",
    "the red dashed loop represents the hexagons with flux changed to integer multiples of @xmath24 . that gives @xmath139 .",
    ", width=272 ]      in the last part , we saw that any single qubit gate can be constructed . in the this section",
    ", we show that in this array multi - qubit operations are also easy to realize on any two qubits .",
    "when we change the flux of the rhombi on the line connecting two holes ( see the yellow line in fig.[multi ] ) , similarly , the states of the corresponding two qubits are flipped at the same time , and this gives @xmath140 term in the hamiltonian . by using the perturbation approach , the amplitude is @xmath141 here , @xmath142 , and the summation contains all the rhombi on yellow line .",
    "we get a effective hamiltonian @xmath138 .",
    "analogously , we can get another type of operation .",
    "we can tune the flux of the hexagons along the loop around two holes to integer multiples of @xmath24 .",
    "this gives a perturbation @xmath143 .",
    "the amplitude is @xmath144 then we get the effective hamiltonian @xmath139 .",
    "the most important thing we are concerned with is to construct cnot operation , because cnot gate together with arbitrary single qubit rotation gate gives rise to a universal quantum computation .",
    "this is also realizable in this array .",
    "first , we should construct another effective hamiltonian .",
    "we tune the flux in such a way that a vortex is transmitted around the @xmath40th hole , and a charge is transmitted from the @xmath145th hole to the outer boundary at the same time .",
    "the effective hamiltonian contains contributions of three parts , @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147 and @xmath148 are evaluated in the same way with @xmath149 and @xmath150 in the last section .",
    "a cnot gate can be constructed with the help of @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "we can let @xmath151 evolve for @xmath154 .",
    "then we should change the external magnetic field to construct @xmath152 and let the system evolve for @xmath155 . finally , we construct @xmath153 and let the system evolve for @xmath156 .",
    "now we get the cnot operation with an external global phase @xmath157 , which is negligible .",
    "in summary , we propose a tqc scheme with protected qubits in a jja system , and we indicate how to perform qubit encoding , single qubit operation , and multi - qubit operation . especially , we show the way to implement the cnot quantum gate operation which is a key element in quantum computation .",
    "the scheme we propose here can be realized in real jja system since the technology of the josephson junction is developing rapidly .",
    "considering the convenience of realizability and scalability of our system , the dimension of ground space is related to the number of punctures on the array .",
    "the logic qubit encoding here is in a protected space so that our system is topologically protected from noise . besides",
    ", specific quasiparticles are driven by proper perturbation transmitted along topologically nontrivial path .",
    "this makes small splittings happen .",
    "we give the effective hamiltonian under different condition corresponding to various splitting situations and this can be used to do quantum computation ."
