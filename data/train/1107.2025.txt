    "black holes which are formed in the early universe are known as primordial black holes ( pbhs ) . a comparison of the cosmological density of the universe at any time after the big bang with the density associated with a black hole shows that pbhs would have of order the particle horizon mass .",
    "pbhs could thus span enormous mass range starting from @xmath2 to more than @xmath3 .",
    "these black holes are formed as a result of initial inhomogeneities @xcite , inflation @xcite , phase transitions @xcite , bubble collisions @xcite , or the decay of cosmic loops @xcite . in 1974 hawking discovered that the black holes emit thermal radiation due to quantum effects @xcite .",
    "so the black holes get evaporated depending upon their masses .",
    "but in references @xcite , it is shown that evaporation of primordial black holes delayed due to accretion of radiation by assuming standard picture of cosmology .",
    "similar kind of works have been done by many other authors @xcite .    in standard picture of cosmology @xcite , universe",
    "is radiation dominated in early period of evolution and is matter dominated now .",
    "so universe is undergoing a decelerated expansion through out its evolution .",
    "but observations of distant supernovae and cosmic microwave background anisotropy indicates that the present universe is undergoing accelerating expansion @xcite . to explain this unwanted observational fact it is thought that present universe is dominated by vacuum energy with negative pressure termed as dark energy . sn ia observations also provide the evidence of a decelerated universe in the recent past with trasition from decelerated to accelerated occuring at redshift @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "so the vacuum energy domination should be started from @xmath5 i.e. @xmath6 .    in this work",
    ", we study the evolution of pbh by considering present universe is vacuum energy dominated . here",
    "we consider accretion of radiation , matter and vacuum energy during respective dominance period and mainly discuss how accretion of vacuum energy affect pbh evolution .",
    "for a spatially flat frw universe with scale factor @xmath7 , the first friedmann equation is @xmath8 and + the total energy conservation equation is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hubble parameter , @xmath11 is the total energy density and @xmath12 is the total pressure of the background fluid . here",
    "we assume the equation of state @xmath13 for the cosmic fluids i.e. radiation ( @xmath14 ) , matter @xmath15 and vacuum energy @xmath16 .",

    "when a pbh accretes radiation , the equation governing this accretion is @xmath27 making use of equation ( [ 2a ] ) i.e. @xmath28 and equation ( [ 3a ] ) , we get @xmath29 on integration , equation ( [ 5b ] ) gives @xmath30^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is an initial mass of pbh at time @xmath32 . the superscript 0 refers to present value of physical quantities .",

    "in radiation dominated era , the mass of the pbh varies accordingly equation @xmath68 this equation can not be solved exactly .",

    "pbh undergoes only evaporation .",
    "i.e. @xmath85    since pbhs are not formed during vacuum energy dominated era , here we only consider the pbh which are formed in radiation dominated era . + solving equations ( [ 7h]),([8a ] ) , ( [ 8b ] ) , ( [ 8c ] ) and ( [ 8d ] ) , we construct the table-3 for a particular pbh evaporating in vacuum energy dominated era .",
    "it is found from the table that accretion of vacuum energy increases the lifespan of pbh .",
    "but evaporating time is independent of accretion efficiency . because with increase in accretion efficiency , critical time ( @xmath61 ) decreases and @xmath86 remains constant .",
