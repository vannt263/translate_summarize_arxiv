    "the anderson impurity model ( aim ) @xcite and its extensions have been a matter of central importance in the recent developments of condensed matter physics . the aim serves not only as a prototype model for the kondo effect @xcite but also as a key ingredient in the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite for strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "recent advances in quantum dot ( qd ) experiments have demonstrated that a quantum dot connected to leads can act as a magnetic impurity in metal so that the kondo - type behavior emerges at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "indeed the kondo effect in quantum dot systems have been probed by many theoretical @xcite and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "the fine tunability of control parameters in quantum dot systems has spurred the investigation of kondo physics in various aspects including a quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads . a flood of very recent works @xcite has focused on this issue as motivated by its potential applications to spintronics .",
    "although there are many theoretical approaches to the solution of the aim , it is still not easy to deal with the aim coupled to ferromagnetic leads , where spin - dependent charge fluctuations need to be taken into account . in other words",
    ", it is necessary to get a non - perturbative method which can deal with both charge and spin excitation channels .",
    "for instance , some of slave - boson mean - field calculations could not describe the finite splitting of the kondo peak @xcite in the spin - dependent case due to the absence of charge fluctuations .",
    "although the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculation is known to provide accurate results for the impurity problem , the standard nrg technique seems not good enough for the spin - polarized system due to the absence of energy scale separation @xcite .    as a way to find an effective approach to the quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads",
    ", we have considered the local moment approach ( lma ) originally suggested by logan and co - workers @xcite .",
    "based on the intuitive notion of local moment fluctuations and the symmetry restoration condition , this approach is technically simple and transparent and yet can cover all energy scales and interaction strengths @xcite .",
    "since it relies on the degeneracy of the two mean - field saddle point configurations , however , it is not obvious how to handle the case with spin polarization .",
    "the original lma of the anderson impurity model in an external field @xcite did not treat each spin component of the full green s function separately , but just calculated the sum . in this work , we extended the lma formalism to include the spin - dependent hybridization .",
    "the basic idea is a generalization of the two - self - energy description , allowing the variation of the weights of the spin - up and spin - down configurations .",
    "the weights of each local moment configuration can be determined through the minimization of the total energy of impurity system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we give a general description of model hamiltonian for the quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads . in section  [ sec : formalism ] , we describe the formalism of our spin - dependent lma ( to be abbreviated as slma ) including basic ideas on the generalization of the two - self - energy description , the symmetry restoration condition , and the determination of configuration weights",
    ". the calculated spectral function for the asymmetric anderson model is given in section  [ sec : result ] , together with a comparison with previous works .",
    "let us consider a model for the quantum dot ( qd ) coupled to two ferromagnetic leads .",
    "figure [ fig : qd ] shows a schematic view of the qd system coupled to ferromagnetic leads with different spin polarization directions .",
    "we assume that a single level qd with a charging energy @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that the qd is equivalent to a single - level impurity state @xcite in the aim . in this system , two cases with parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) magnetic configurations",
    "are possible for the ferromagnetically ordered leads . by making the canonical transformation @xcite , both p and ap configurations could be mapped onto an effective model with a single lead . after the transformation , the ap configuration was shown to be equivalent to a usual qd coupled to a single non - magnetic lead .",
    "thus , from now on , we will focus on the p configuration where the spin - dependence becomes explicit . with the fermi energy kept at the energy origin ( @xmath1 ) , the hamiltonian for the p configuration can be represented by @xmath2 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 @xmath4 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for an electron with the wave vector @xmath5 and spin @xmath6 in the leads .",
    "and @xmath7 @xmath8 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for electrons in the dot .",
    "the local zeeman coupling energy @xmath9 is included for the sake of generality . here",
    "it is noted that the effective dot - lead coupling @xmath10 is connected to the original qd model in figure [ fig : qd ] : @xmath11 considering its parametric dependence , the spin - dependent tunneling amplitude @xmath12 can be described by introducing a polarization parameter @xmath13 for the spin - dependent host density - of - states ( dos ) @xmath14 : @xmath15 neglecting the dependence on @xmath5 of @xmath12 in the large band width limit of conduction electrons , the spin - dependent hybridization parameter @xmath16 can be approximated by a simplified form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "some authors have pointed out that the shape of the conduction band may be important in this problem @xcite . however , for the sake of simplicity , we only deal with the @xmath19 limit without considering the detailed band structure .",
    "therefore , the green s function of the d electrons can take a simple form of @xmath20 in the non - interacting limit ( @xmath21 ) . in what follows",
    ", we consider the case of @xmath22 only .",
    "the lma starts off based on the mean - field , i.e. , unrestricted - hartree - fock ( uhf ) , solutions of the aim . for large @xmath0 values ,",
    "the uhf treatment of the single - orbital aim gives the doubly degenerate local moment solutions @xcite .",
    "two solutions are denoted by @xmath23 or @xmath24 , corresponding to the local moments @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . in order to remedy the broken symmetry nature of the uhf solutions",
    ", lma employs the two - self - energy description ( tse ) : @xmath27.\\ ] ] in this framework , the lma is designed to describe the local moment at the impurity site , fluctuating between the two configurations , @xmath28 and @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , to include the dynamics of the self - energy going beyond the static uhf self - energy , the lma uses the hf green s function as a bare propagator for the calculations of the higher - order diagrams ( which will be discussed in detail in section  [ subsec : self - energies ] ) .",
    "the higher - order terms for the self - energy are indeed enough for describing the fermi liquid behavior at low energy scale , but to do this it is required to introduce the symmetry restoration ( sr ) condition and the friedel sum rule for recovery of the correct low energy behavior .",
    "the sr condition plays a role in linking the two configurations @xmath28 and @xmath24 at low energies . taking advantage of its efficiency and transparency ,",
    "the lma has been applied to the lattice model within the framework of dynamical mean - field theory @xcite .      in the absence of spin polarization ,",
    "the uhf approximation gives two degenerate broken symmetry solutions : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , in the presence of spin polarization , the two mean - field saddle points become no more degenerate . to distinguish two solutions , we labeled two configurations by @xmath23 or @xmath24 , corresponding to the local moment @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "taking account of the configurations @xmath28 and @xmath24 , we obtained the mean - field propagator @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 here we introduced the configuration - dependent on - site energy , @xmath36 , which may be necessary for describing the @xmath37-dependent renormalization of the on - site energy under the asymmetric configuration .",
    "and the corresponding spectral densities @xmath38 are @xmath39 consequently , the mean - field charge and moment could be determined from the self - consistent solution of the following equations : @xmath40\\nonumber\\\\    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath28 and @xmath24 , respectively .      for the spin - dependent case , where the up - spin and down - spin symmetry no longer exists , we generalized the lma description of the green s function by allowing the two saddle point configurations to have different weights . extending the original two - self - energy description ,",
    "the average green s function could be expressed as @xmath43 where the green s function for each configurations @xmath37 is provided as @xmath44 with the @xmath37-dependent @xmath45 and the corresponding self - energy @xmath46 : @xmath47 the configuration weight @xmath48 or @xmath49 reflects the probability of @xmath28 or @xmath24 configuration . in the absence of spin - dependence , @xmath48 is trivially equal to @xmath50 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath37 of @xmath51 arises from the relative chemical potential shift of the @xmath28 and @xmath24 configurations due to the @xmath37-dependent renormalization of the bare energy level .      .",
    "the shaded bubble represents the polarization propagator as given by the rpa - like particle - hole ladder sum in the transverse spin channel .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the evaluation of self - energy in the spin - dependent lma ( slma ) followed the same steps prescribed in the standard lma procedure , the details of which are given in @xcite .",
    "the difference in our procedure lies mainly on the spin - dependent terms due to the non - degenerate local moment configurations .",
    "following the notations in @xcite , the self - energies were divided into the static hf term and the rest : @xmath52 the purely static contribution @xmath53 is given by the uhf calculation . and all of the dynamics",
    "is contained in the @xmath54 $ ] , which is a functional of the underlying mf propagator @xmath55 , as shown in figure [ fig : self ] : @xmath56 this diagram contains the dynamical spin - flip processes , and within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) the polarization diagrams are calculated , @xmath57 with the bare particle - hole bubble @xmath58      the symmetry restoration ( sr ) is required to recover the fermi liquid behavior at low @xmath59 . to achieve the same goal in the spin - dependent formalism",
    ", we have to modify the original sr condition for the generalized two - self - energy description with the different weights @xmath48 and @xmath49 for spin - up and down configurations , respectively . in terms of self - energies , we can rewrite ( [ eq : tse ] ) as @xmath60 we could consider the following relation between the single self - energy @xmath61 and the two - self - energies @xmath62 : @xmath63 ^ 2}{\\omega^+ + { \\rm i}\\delta_0(1+\\sigma p){\\rm sgn}(\\omega ) - c_a f_{b\\sigma}(\\omega ) - ( 1-c_a)f_{a\\sigma}(\\omega )   } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is defined with @xmath32 . since the two - self - energies vanish at the fermi level , i.e. , @xmath65 , by imposing the condition that the imaginary part of self - energy at the fermi level must be equal to zero , we could obtain the following generalized sr condition : @xmath66 this sr condition contains the relative chemical potential shift of two configurations .",
    "one can readily note that this generalized version of sr reduces to the original sr condition when there is no relative chemical potential shift , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , when the sr condition of ( [ gsr ] ) is satisfied , the friedel sum rule @xcite equation can be written as @xmath68.\\ ] ] this is complementary to the previous physical arguments related to the fermi liquid behavior at the fermi level . here",
    "our self - energy arguments assert that the sr must be taken into account , when we are dealing with the two - self - energy descriptions .",
    "to make the practical calculation feasible , we introduced a physically motivated approximation . that the total impurity charge @xmath69 does not depend on @xmath70 or @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath71    where @xmath72.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] within this assumption ,",
    "we fixed the value of @xmath69 as calculated for the @xmath73 system . thus , we were able to determine @xmath74 and @xmath75 for a given @xmath69 .    although the best way to do this is the self - consistent determination of @xmath76 , there is no practical method available to determine the @xmath76 self - consistently at present .",
    "since the assumption on the independence of @xmath69 on @xmath70 and @xmath13 is subtle but important in the real calculations , it may deserve more explanation .",
    "at least , both the exact bethe ansatz solutions @xcite and the nrg calculation @xcite show the independence of @xmath69 on @xmath70 . indeed this result supports that our assumption is valid at least for the @xmath77 case . even though the there is no explicit report for the case of @xmath78",
    ", we can say that this assumptions is a good approximation for two cases where the charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed by either the particle - hole symmetry or the large on - site interaction , i.e. , @xmath79 .",

    "the other configurations ( e.g. @xmath83 ) has quite different energy scale to display in one figure.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for the ground state energy of the system , we adopted the following expression @xcite : @xmath84 g_\\sigma(\\omega ) \\right\\ } d \\omega,\\ ] ] which is certainly valid only for the wide - band limit .",
    "it may be necessary to include the contribution from the conduction electron part for the general case . in the spin - dependent lma ,",
    "@xmath48 was taken as a variational parameter for the energy minimization . for a given @xmath48 ,",
    "there exists a corresponding set of lma parameters ( @xmath85 ) which satisfies the self - consistent equations ( sr , friedel sumrule and filling constraint ) .",
    "hence we were able to calculate the ground state energy for the given @xmath48 which minimizes the total energy .",
    "figure [ fig : cvse ] shows the energy versus @xmath48 curve for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "( here we display the results of @xmath86 considering the symmetry . ) for the @xmath87 case , the minimum is present at @xmath88 as expected .",

    "our results on the finite splitting of kondo peak are found to be consistent with those of numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculations @xcite . as @xmath13 increases , the kondo peaks for @xmath91 and @xmath92 shift in the opposite directions and the kondo peaks split into two and the values of the spectral functions at fermi level decrease . as a result ,",
    "kondo effects are reduced or suppressed in the presence of ferromagnetic leads .",
    "the relatively small magnitudes of the splitting are attributed to the similar underestimation of the width of kondo peaks in the standard lma .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : dvsp ] , qualitative features such as dependence on @xmath13 of kondo peak splitting @xmath93 are in good agreement with nrg . one can observe that @xmath93 is linear in the @xmath13 , confirming the nrg result @xcite .",
    "the finite splitting of kondo peaks may be understood via haldane s scaling arguments : the renormalization of the on - site energy is spin - dependent due to the spin - dependence of the hybridization ; @xmath94 where @xmath95 was attributed to the splitting of the renormalized levels @xcite .",
    "then , the coupling acts as an effective magnetic field , leading to the finite splitting .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spectral ] , one can note that the mean - field peaks are also shifted in opposite directions . in the lma scheme ,",
    "the shift of the mean - field peak , arises from the different chemical potential shift of @xmath28 and @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "when we fixed the @xmath97 , we could not observe the shifts although the weights of peaks become drastically different .",
    "the hubbard satellites were more pronounced in slma , while the same mean - field peak shifts are rather small in the nrg calculations .",
    "it is well known that the high energy features are usually underrated in the calculation of dynamical properties with the nrg method @xcite .",
    "in addition , this problem becomes more serious in the spin symmetry breaking system due to the absence of energy scale separation @xcite .",
    "in fact , the kondo peak of the down - spin electron in our results is remarkable to observable .",
    "the peaks of down - spin is higher than the peaks of up - spin with the same @xmath13 . even though this is consistent with nrg results , there are some problems . in the nrg method ,",
    "the height of the kondo peak is decreased as increase of @xmath13 , but our results show the opposite trend .",
    "the filling constraint which is introduced as the physically motivated approximation in section [ subsec : filling ] could be the possible source of this difference .",
    "but it is very difficult to work out the source of the problem at this stage .",
    "treating this problem could be an important issue for future work .     of the kondo peak as a function of @xmath13 for @xmath98 and @xmath81 .",
