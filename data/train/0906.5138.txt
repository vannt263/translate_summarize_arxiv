    "the matter is that known existing qm bound systems are driven and stabilized by an internal ( electromagnetic ) field .",
    "they interact with external fields by exchanging resonant photons easily observed by spectroscopic methods , consequently , their nature is well understood within the quantum field theory .",
    "contrarily , the qb is an example of a system driven by an external fields : the gravitational one and an elastic reaction of perfect mirror .",
    "thus , the qb is an academic non - radiating qm object without field theory extention .",
    "recently , results of measurements of `` gravitational quantum states '' of ucns in the earth gravitational field were reported in a series of publications [ 2 - 16 ] .",
    "the experiment was conducted at the reactor facility located at the laue - langevin institute , grenoble ( further referred as the grenoble experiment , by the authors , for short ) .",
    "the authors claim that quantum states in earth gravitational field are observed for the first time .",
    "though they do not directly use the term of `` qb states '' , the states to be observed are numerically the qb exact ones .",
    "the matter is that a neutron above the mirror in the experiment is actually `` a running bouncer '' ( that is , a 3d , at least 2d , in general , evolving quantum object ) .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a critical analysis of the experiment .",
    "experiment setup : interior of the vacuum chamber . shown",
    "are the ucn guide ( 1 ) ;   collimating blades ( 2 ) ;   static collimator ( 3 ) ;   the absorbing slit ( 4 ) ;   bottom mirror ( 5 ) ;   detector ( 6 ) ;   mechanical support ( 7 ) .",
    "two possible trajectories of neutrons capable of entering the wave guide are shown @xcite , @xcite , title=\"fig : \" ] [ set ]",
    "the experiment setup ( see fig . [ set ] ) has four parts : the front part outside the slit , - neutron collimator and front aperture ( 1 - 3 ) ; the absorbing slit - absorption of `` unwanted neutrons '' and exit of `` survivors '' ( 4 ) ; the bottom mirror including a part of the open mirror ( outside the slit ) , where running and bouncing neutrons are supposed to be formed ( 5 ) ; the back part - detection of neutrons transmitted through the slit ( 6 ) .    in the experiment ,",
    "a neutron in free fall between reflection points on the open mirror is studied on the subject of its gravitational quantum states .",
    "a neutron source is a high - power thermal nuclear reactor .",
    "there is a collimating ucn guide system to transport neutrons from the reactor to the horizontally placed , rectangular neutron wave guide ( further called the slit ) .",
    "incident neutrons flies into the slit through a front opening .",
    "they are characterized by a spectrum in the speed range of about @xmath18 @xmath19 and have a very small deviation from directionality of incidence .",
    "since the incident neutron spectrum is not `` cold '' enough to provide ucns in the `` quantization '' energy range , `` unwanted '' ( high bouncing ) neutrons should be removed . for this purpose ,",
    "the upper wall of the slit is made of efficient absorber .",
    "survived neutrons are those , which escape absorption and are able to pass through the slit .",
    "they come out of the slit through a back opening and become  running bouncers  that is , keep bouncing in a projectile motion in open space above the mirror before hitting an external detector ( as shown in fig . [ set ] ) .",
    "the absorber in the slit plays a role of a selector of neutrons having small vertical momenta @xmath20 , ( @xmath21 is a magnitude of the total momentum ) .",
    "a spectrum of @xmath22 depends on an absorber height @xmath23 , while the latter is variable in the range of about @xmath24 @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding ( expected ) quantum levels in a vertical direction @xmath25 are in the range of few @xmath26 , roughly , in proportion @xmath10 , where @xmath6 is neutron mass .",
    "those energy values are about 5 orders less than actual kinetic energy @xmath27 of neutrons in the slit .",
    "a severity of experiment conditions is aggravated by non - coherence of the neutron source and the corresponding stochasticity of neutron events in the slit and the open mirror area .",
    "in particular , @xmath27 and `` a classical return point '' ( or a hight of projectile trajectory ) @xmath28 are randomly distributed quantities in a wide range of their values .    in an ideal classical picture , transmitted neutrons",
    "are those , which avoid absorption in a first reflection at a grazing angle @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a minimal distance between reflections ( it is less or equal to the length of the absorbing slit ) .",
    "the angle can be assessed also as @xmath31 , were @xmath32 is a critical value of @xmath22 , corresponding to the critical height of the projectile trajectory @xmath33 . in the grenoble experiment ,",
    "the angle is of order @xmath34 .",
    "`` the ideal picture '' is referred to the authors _ specularity _ , or _ mirror perfectness _ , assumption ( equality of incidence and reflection angles in single events ) . a real mirror is characterized by `` grazing roughness '' .",
    "another cause of imperfectness may come from the fact that a mirror used in the experiment has a room temperature .    in the qm approach ,",
    "the amount of transmitted neutrons is less than the above ( ideal ) classical estimates because of heisenberg s fluctuation of projectile heights in multiple reflections .",
    "later we shall see that it makes a severe destructive effect : at small @xmath23 , the absorber `` kills '' neutrons having lowest @xmath22 value , a characteristic of the qb ground state in the authors model .",
    "the authors plan of the experiment is based on the following premises and procedures :    \\a ) preparation , with the use of absorbing slit , of the assemble of neutrons having as low @xmath20 as possible , and by this way provide conditions for quantum pattern formation in the @xmath35-distribution of probability density for survived neutrons ( ones passed through the slit ) . in the open mirror area , they are supposed to become `` running bouncers '' characterized by the wave ( airy ) function in the vertical direction .",
    "\\b ) measurement of transmission curve ( a count rate @xmath36 as a function of absorber height @xmath23 ) with the following assessment of gravitational level parameters from measured data .",
    "the transmission function is thought to be associated with the @xmath35-distribution of neutron probability density @xmath37 and the corresponding gravitational levels @xmath25 in terms of the above airy function modes .    how those terms are related to the airy equation in the authors 1d model is seen from fig .",
    "[ quantbouncer ] , where the squared airy functions @xmath38 are plotted .",
    "they are proportional to the probability density @xmath35-distributions with respect to the mirror at @xmath39 position . shown",
    "are states for @xmath40 .",
    "it sould be noted that the resulting @xmath35-distribution of probability density @xmath41 must look as a fairly smooth function : no distinct quantum pattern to be measured",
    ".     squared wave functions , or probability density ( not normalized ) for four first states @xmath25 : @xmath42 ; bottom mirror position is fixed at @xmath39 ; neutrons fall from distances in the upper half - space @xmath43 ; @xmath23  the absorber height . by summing up the graphs ,",
    "one is supposed to get a picture of resulting distribution @xmath37 @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ quantbouncer ]",
    "thus , the purpose of the experiment is `` to observe '' running quantum bouncers by the detector placed at the end of the open mirror , while the detector counts _ all _ neutrons passed through the slit per second ( as a function of the absorber height @xmath23 ) .",
    "however , placing the detector at any distance from the back edge of the slit will not change the result ( as far as emerged neutrons are not `` lost '' on their way to the detector ) .",
    "in particular , the detector of sufficient area can be placed somewhere behind the open mirror ( outside the apparatus ) or right at a back edge of the slit . in both cases ,",
    "the airy boundary conditions are not valid .",
    "it means that the measured transmission curve @xmath36 is not sensitive to a possible quantum pattern in the @xmath35-distribution of probability density @xmath37 .",
    "recall , the latter is defined in airy function terms for a vertical motion of `` the running bouncer '' .",
    "obviously , counting neutrons at different @xmath23 is not `` the observation '' of their gravitational quantum states .",
    "a count rate does not change either if the level of the open mirror is put lower than that inside the slit .",
    "we made this remark in connection with the authors attempt `` to adjust '' the level , shifting the open mirror slightly lower ( by about the first level distance @xmath44 @xmath45 ) in order  to pronounce the first step ",
    "@xcite , @xcite ( see the mirror cut in half by a black line in fig . [ set ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , no effect was eventually found ; so the `` adjustment '' idea was abandoned .",
    "therefore , we state that the authors idea of extracting quantum information from measured transmission curve is the major methodological misconception : the treatment of relationship between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is wrong .",
    "let us track the root of the misconception .",
    "the authors seemingly start with a right approach when associate quantum levels with the probability density @xmath35-distribution for individual states @xmath46 of a quantum bouncer running in the open mirror region .",
    "the ideal neutron assemble is characterized by a superposition of modes @xmath47 , which determine the resulting probability density @xmath37 ( as in fig .",
    "[ quantbouncer ] ) .",
    "the problem begins when they introduce the concept of transmission function @xmath36 to be measured and analyzed in connection with the airy wave function and the corresponding @xmath37 .",
    "the misconception is rooted in `` the principle of observation '' introduced by the authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite :    _ `` below about 15 @xmath45 , no neutrons can pass the slit ... ideally , we expect a stepwise dependence of transmission as a function of width",
    ". if the width is smaller than the spatial width of the lowest quantum state , then transmission will be zero .",
    "when the width is equal to the spatial width of the lowest quantum state , the transmission will increase sharply . a further increase in the width should not increase the transmission as long as the width is smaller than the spatial width of the second quantum state . then again",
    ", the transmission should increase stepwise . at sufficiently high slit width one",
    "approaches the classical dependence . '' _",
    "our comment on `` the principle of observation '' is , as next .",
    "as was explained , the transmission function @xmath36 carries no information about physical processes occuring with neutrons in the open mirror area .",
    "the information , to which @xmath36 is sensitive , solely concerns processes inside the absorbing slit . the transmission is proportional to a ratio @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a count rate of neutrons passed through an _ absorbing _ slit , and @xmath50 is a count rate of neutrons passed through a _",
    "non - absorbing _ slit under all other equivalent conditions .",
    "the ratio is a probability of neutron `` survival '' in a multiple reflections inside the slit , @xmath51 , which is a function of @xmath23 .",
    "it depends on an average number of bouncings @xmath52 , or the length of absoring slit .",
    "theoretically , the transmission @xmath36 is a functional of a neutron wave function _ inside the absorbing slit_. the functional is described by the non - stationary non - separable equation for the absorbing slit , the solution of which has nothing to do with the airy function ( since the absorber greatly influences the wave form and makes the mode essentially decaying ) .",
    "roughly , @xmath53^{n_b}$ ] , where @xmath54 is a probability of absorption in one bouncing ( strictly speaking , it is a function on @xmath55 bouncing ) .",
    "once a neutron passed through the slit , its probability of being counted is fixed ( ideally 100 % ) .    to understand how the authors came up with the ( criticized ) `` stepwise '' picture , consider two , intuitively similar but physically different quantities : a neutron flux @xmath56 measured and the probability density @xmath37 looked for .",
    "one can mistakenly think that the quantum pattern in @xmath37 is `` projected '' on the screen in a manner of wave diffraction picture from a coherent source .",
    "the actually measured quantity is a neutron count rate ( the transmission @xmath36 ) @xmath57 where a flux @xmath58 is a product of practically uniform quantities : a neutron density @xmath59  @xmath60 and a horizontal speed @xmath61 ; @xmath62 is a cross - section area of detected neutron flux , @xmath63 is a detector efficiency , and @xmath64 is a probability of reflection of incident neutron off the front aperture due to diffraction . in the experiment ,",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath65 are close to @xmath66 % , @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath23 , and @xmath67 ( the term @xmath68 must be disregarded as @xmath69 ) .",
    "thus , the measured transmission is @xmath70 .",
    "neither @xmath59 nor @xmath61 are `` quantized '' .    the authors objective @xmath37 is an analog of the classical probability density @xmath71 , that has nothing to do with @xmath56 and @xmath36 .",
    "the method of `` gravitational level '' measurement must be analogous to the measurement of @xmath72 ( the latter is not even mentioned in the authors works ) .",
    "the above discussed major misconception and other methodological deficiencies make the authors claims not justified .",
    "below we shall see that the experimental data themselves (  no steps observed  ) are in contradiction with the authors claim .",
    "we also note that some insignificant irregularities in measured curves could be instrumental ones that is , due to wave diffraction on the front aperture .",
    "those ( not discussed ) instrumental effects could falsely imitate the physical ones , which the authors are looking for .",
    "the experiment has a history of results published in a series of works , which we refer to `` early '' and `` latest '' periods .",
    "the two periods are principally different in key results of `` steps '' measurements , though the experimental setup has not been changed .",
    "surprisingly , the `` steps '' were demonstrated in early works 2000 - 2004 @xcite , @xcite :    _ `` we report experimental evidence for gravitational quantum bound states of neutrons ... under such [ slit ] conditions , the falling neutrons do not move continuously along the vertical direction , but rather jump from one height to another , as predicted by quantum theory ' ' _ .",
    "the early measurements occurred to be technically or statistically mistaken .",
    "the authors tacitly admitted it in publications of new results and presented the `` improved '' version of experiment treatment and fitting procedure with some new phenomenological assumptions .",
    "a more accurately measured transmission function in fig.[ucntransmlater ] , @xcite , appears a smooth curve , with no statistically significant `` quantum pattern '' .",
    "the authors commented it :    _ `` it was found , that except for the ground state , the stepwise increase is mostly washed out . '' _",
    "new measurements of neutron transmission : neutron counts versus rough scatterer / absorber height .",
    "the circles with error bars are the experimental data .",
    "the upper curve is a classical model @xmath73 .",
    "the lower curve is a semi - classical model where only the lowest quantum level is taken into account .",
    "the experimental points are approximated by a model where higher levels are taken into account , @xcite , title=\"fig : \" ] [ ucntransmlater ]    there is a `` cut - off '' in the curve : no counts at small absorber heights .",
    "the matter is that the absorber works as a neutron sink . at small heights , it `` kills ''",
    "neutrons in the ground state . indeed , a bouncing ( vertical ) amplitude fluctuates in accordance with the heisenberg uncertainty .",
    "for small widths @xmath74 , the uncertainty principle makes the effect : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "in a course of multiple bouncing , a neutron eventually hits the absorber , what results in transmission blockage ( a cut - off in the curve ) . to illustrate the problem ,",
    "consider a neutron absorption probability @xmath77 per one bounce at some absorber height @xmath23 .",
    "roughly , a quantum bouncer makes about 15 bounces in the slit .",
    "hence , a chance to pass through the slit is @xmath78 .",
    "for some small small height , where @xmath79 ,  the chance is about @xmath80 .",
    "this is how a sharp cut - off is produced at about @xmath81 .",
    "after that , a transmission curve must be a monotonously increasing function .",
    "as noted , there could be some ` irregularities' in the curve due to residual effects of diffraction of neutrons on the front aperture .    in the final authors claim , the statement of observation of first ( `` ground '' ) state is emphasized .",
    "the authors admitted , however , that `` the population '' of the first level is inexplicably low .",
    "indeed , how one can observe the `` ground state '' of neutrons , which are mostly `` killed '' by the absorber and for this reason do not exist in the open space above the bottom mirror , hence , are not detectable and , indeed , have not been detected .",
    "the authors of the grenoble experiment claim that neutron quantum levels ( at least , the first one ) in the gravitational field of earth were observed for the first time .",
    "we consider such an experiment a great challenge because gravitational neutron quantum states were never observed before and the issue of their exitance is of great importance .",
    "our detailed analysis of the experiment is focused on both methodology and measured data .",
    "unfortunately , the conclusion is made that the objective and methodology of the experiment are not formulated in rigorous qm terms .",
    "the method of gravitational level measurement , in our view , is based on the misconception , hence , not adequate to the experiment objective .",
