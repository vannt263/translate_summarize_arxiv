    "for example , some considered encounters of single satellites with galactic disks , a set - up which is at odds with cdm predictions of multiple , nearly contemporaneous accretion events .",
    "other studies made ad hoc assumptions about the orbital parameters and internal structures of the infalling systems .",
    "consequently , it remains uncertain whether these earlier investigations faithfully captured the responses of galactic disks to halo substructure in a cosmological context .",
    "here we address this issue using a hybrid approach that combines cosmological simulations to derive the merger histories of galaxy - sized cdm halos with controlled numerical experiments of consecutive subhalo impacts onto @xmath0-body realizations of fully - formed disk galaxies .",
    "we demonstrate that accretion histories of the kind expected in models are capable of severely perturbing galactic disks and generating a wealth of distinctive signatures in the structural and kinematic properties of disk stars .",
    "the resulting morphological features are similar to those being discovered in the milky way ( mw ) , m31 , and in other disk galaxies .",
    "we also show that satellite - disk interactions produce dynamically - cold , ring - like features around galactic disks that are quantitatively similar to the monoceros ring in the mw .",
    "this suggests that such observed stellar structures may arise naturally as a result of subhalo - disk encounters , which can excite perturbations in _",
    "disk stars_. these findings imply that detailed observations of galactic structure may be able to distinguish between competing cosmological models by determining whether the detailed structure of galactic disks is as excited as predicted by the cdm paradigm .",
    "the aim of this study is to assess the effects of cdm substructure on the dynamical evolution of thin galactic disks .",
    "a thorough description of our methods is presented in and we summarize them here .",
    "first , we analyze cosmological simulations of the formation of four galaxy - sized halos in the cosmology .",
    "the simulations were performed with the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) @xmath0-body code ( ( * ? ? ? * kravtsov 1999 ) ) .",
    "all of these halos accrete only a small fraction of their final masses and experience no major mergers at @xmath3 ( a look - back time of @xmath4  gyr ) , and therefore may reasonably host a disk galaxy .",
    "second , we identify subhalos in these hosts and select the massive substructures that pass near the center of the host halo where they may interact appreciably with a galactic disk for further consideration .",
    "finally , we use a representative subset of these accretion events from one of the host halos to seed controlled @xmath0-body simulations of satellite impacts onto an initially - thin disk galaxy .",
    "while the present work is informed by many past numerical investigations of satellite - disk interactions , our methodology is characterized by at least three major improvements .",
    "first , we consider satellite populations whose properties ( mass functions , internal structures , orbital parameters , and accretion times ) are extracted directly from the cosmological simulations of galaxy - sized cdm halos .",
    "this eliminates many assumptions regarding the internal properties and impact parameters of infalling systems inherent in many previous studies .",
    "second , we employ primary disk galaxy models that are both self - consistent and flexible enough to permit detailed modeling of actual galaxies such as the mw and m31 by fitting to a wide range of observational data sets ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* widrow & dubinski 2005 ) ) .",
    "this allows us to set up thin , equilibrium realistic disk galaxies without instabilities and transient effects that can be present in other schemes . in this work ,",
    "we employ galaxy model mwb of which reproduces many of the observed characteristics of the mw galaxy .",
    "this galaxy model comprises an exponential stellar disk with a sech@xmath5 scale height of @xmath6 , a hernquist model bulge , and an nfw dark matter halo .",
    "lastly , and most importantly , we incorporate for the first time a model in which the infalling subhalo populations are representative of those that impinge upon halo centers since @xmath1 , instead of the @xmath7 _ surviving _ substructure present in a cdm halo .",
    "previous studies utilized the _ present - day _ properties of a large ensemble of dark matter subhalos in order to investigate the dynamical effects of substructure on galactic disks ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* font et al . 2001 ; gauthier et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "successes notwithstanding , this methodology has the drawback of eliminating from consideration those massive satellites that , prior to @xmath7 , pass very close to the central regions of their hosts , where the galactic disk resides .",
    "these systems can potentially produce strong tidal effects on the disk , but are unlikely to constitute effective perturbers at @xmath7 as they suffer substantial mass loss during their orbital evolution precisely because of their forays into the central halo ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , very few satellites in present - day subhalo populations are likely to have a significant dynamical impact on the disk structure.,width=384 ]    figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the importance of accounting for subhalo infall over time . this figure is a scatter plot of mass versus pericentric distance for two different satellite populations within all four galaxy - sized host cdm halos .",
    "the masses and distances in figure  [ fig1 ] have been scaled to the mass , @xmath13 , and radial scale length , @xmath8 , of the stellar disk in the primary galaxy model used in the satellite - disk encounter simulations . for the purposes of this presentation , we have also scaled the virial quantities ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) of all four galaxy - sized host halos to a common host of _ total _ mass , @xmath16 , and _ tidal _ radius , @xmath17 , as in the primary disk galaxy model .",

    "we refer to this area as the `` danger zone '' .",
    "satellites within this area are expected to constitute effective perturbers and may cause considerable damage to the disk , but we intend this as a rough criterion to aid in illustrating our point .",

    "the second subhalo population consists of systems that approach the central regions of their hosts since a redshift @xmath22 .",
    "these subhalos cross within a ( scaled ) infall radius of @xmath9 from the host halo center .",
    "this selection is fixed empirically to identify orbiting substructure that are likely to have a significant dynamical impact on the structure of the disk ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kazantzidis et al . 2007 ) ) .",
    "the masses associated with this group of satellites are defined at the simulation output time nearest the inward crossing of @xmath23 .",
    "pericenters are computed from the orbit of a test particle in a static nfw potential whose properties match those of the host cdm halo at the time of @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] demonstrates that the @xmath7 subhalo populations contain very few massive systems on potentially damaging orbits . in fact , statistics of all four galaxy - sized host halos indicate that only _ one _ satellite can be identified inside the danger zone in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "the danger zone contains numerous substructures that passed through or near the galactic disk since @xmath22 . on average ,",
    "@xmath24 satellites more massive than @xmath25 cross through the central region of a galaxy - sized halo with @xmath20 during this period .",
    "this suggests that close encounters between massive subhalos and galactic disks since @xmath22 are common occurrences in standard .",
    "thus , it is important to account for such accretion events to model the cumulative dynamical effects of halo substructure on disk galaxies .",
    "in what follows , we focus on one of the host halo accretion histories to seed controlled @xmath0-body experiments of subhalo - disk encounters .",
    "we identify target satellites that are likely to have a substantial effect on the disk structure by imposing two selection criteria .",
    "first , we limit our search to satellites that approach the central region of their host with small orbital pericenters ( @xmath26 ) since @xmath22 .",
    "second , we restrict re - simulation to subhalos that are a significant fraction of the disk mass , but not more massive than the disk itself ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the aforementioned criteria resulted in six accretion events of satellites with masses and tidal radii of @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , respectively , from a single host to simulate over a @xmath30  gyr period .",
    "additional properties of these substructures can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kazantzidis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ) .",
    "we modeled subhalo impacts onto the disk as a sequence of encounters .",
    "starting with the first satellite , we included subsequent systems at the epoch when they were recorded in the cosmological simulation .",
    "we extracted the density structures of these cosmological subhalos and followed the procedure outlined in to construct self - consistent , @xmath0-body realizations of satellites models .",
    "each system was represented with @xmath31 particles and a gravitational softening length of @xmath32 . for the primary disk galaxy , we used @xmath33 particles to represent the disk , @xmath34 in the bulge , and @xmath35 in the dark matter halo , and softenings of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "all satellite - disk encounter simulations were carried out using pkdgrav ( ( * ? ? ? * stadel 2001 ) ) .",
    "the `` final '' disk discussed in the next sections has experienced all six subhalo impacts and was evolved in isolation for @xmath39  gyr after the last interaction .",
    "this ensures that all of the resultant morphological features are long - lived rather than transient .",
    "consequently , our results are relevant to systems that exhibit no obvious , ongoing encounters .",
    "finally , we compute all disk properties and show all visualizations of the disk morphology after centering the disk to its center of mass and rotating it to a new coordinate frame defined by the three principal axes of the total disk inertia tensor .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] depicts the transformation of the global structure of a thin galactic disk that experiences a merging history of the kind expected in the paradigm of structure formation .",
    "this figure shows face - on and edge - on views of the initial and final distribution of disk stars .",
    "particles are color - coded on a logarithmic scale with brighter colors in regions of higher stellar density .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] demonstrates that encounters with cdm substructure are responsible for generating several distinctive morphological signatures in the disk .",
    "the final disk is considerably thicker ( or `` flared '' ) compared to the initial distribution of disk stars and a wealth of low - density features have developed both in and above the disk plane as a consequence of these disturbances . particularly intriguing",
    "is the fact that a high - density , in - plane structure survives after the satellite bombardment .",
    "a standard `` thin - thick '' disk decomposition analysis for the final disk indicates that this feature would be recognized as a thin disk component ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kazantzidis et al . 2007 ) ) .",
    "the edge - on view of the final disk also reveals additional filamentary structures and other complex configurations above the disk plane .",
    "these structures bear some resemblance to tidal streams , but are in fact disk stars that have been excited by the subhalo impacts .",
    "interestingly , the same image shows a characteristic `` x '' shape in the bright central disk , a finding also reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gauthier et al . ( 2006 ) ) .",
    "this feature is often linked to secular evolution of galaxies driven by the presence of a bar when it buckles as a result of becoming unstable to bending modes .",
    ", while the _ right _ panel depicts the disk after the last satellite passage , evolved in isolation for additional @xmath40  gyr , so that the evolution of disk stars is followed from @xmath22 to @xmath7 . the edge - on ( _ upper panels _ ) and face - on ( _ bottom panels _ ) views of the disk are displayed in each frame and the local density was calculated using an sph smoothing kernel of @xmath41 particles .",
    "satellite - disk interactions of the kind expected in models produce several distinctive signatures in galactic disks including : long - lived , low - surface brightness , ring - like features in the outskirts ; conspicuous flares ; bars ; and faint filamentary structures above the disk plane that ( spuriously ) resemble tidal streams in configuration space .",
    "these morphological features are similar to those being discovered in the milky way , m31 , and in other disk galaxies.,width=432 ]    the face - on image of the final disk illustrates the formation of a moderately strong bar and extended ring - like features in the outskirts of the disk .",
    "the existence of these features indicate that the axisymmetry of the disk has been destroyed by the encounters with the infalling subhalos .",
    "we emphasize that the aforementioned structures are persistent , surviving for a considerable time after the satellite passages ( @xmath39  gyr ) , and that the bar is induced in response to the accretion events , not by amplified noise .",
    "both features drive further evolution by redistributing mass and angular momentum throughout the disk .",
    "thus , encounters with infalling satellites affect galactic disks both _ directly _ by imparting energy to stars and _ indirectly _ by exciting global instabilities .",
    "lastly , the final face - on disk is significantly more structured at low densities and large radii compared to the initial disk and is quite reminiscent of the outer disk structure seen around m31 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ibata et al . 2005 ) ) .",
    "among the most striking signatures induced by the subhalo accretion events in our simulations is the pronounced increase in disk thickness .",
    "a quantitative analysis of disk thickening is presented in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "this figure shows that the initial disk thickens considerably at all radii as a result of the substructure impacts .",
    "remarkably , the scale height of the disk near the solar radius increases in excess of a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "the outer disk is much more susceptible to damage by the infalling satellites : at @xmath42 the scale height grows by @xmath43 compared to approximately a factor of @xmath44 increase at @xmath45 . the larger binding energy of the inner , exponential disk and the presence of a massive bulge ( @xmath46 that acts as a sink of satellite orbital energy are responsible for the robustness of the inner disk .",
    "given that infalling subhalos are very extended and the self - gravity of the disk grows weaker as a function of distance from the center , it is not unexpected that the scale height of the disk should increase with radius yielding a flared disk .",
    "indeed , making the simplest assumption that the accreting satellites deposit their orbital energy roughly constant in radius , it can be shown that the disk scale height will increase as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the disk surface density ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kazantzidis et al . 2007 ) ) .",
    "* font et al . ( 2001 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gauthier et al . ( 2006 ) ) performed similar numerical studies of the dynamical response of disks to cdm subhalos .",
    "both investigations reported negligible tidal effects on the global structure of the disk .",
    "in contrast , figure  [ fig3 ] indicates substantial disk thickening due to substructure bombardment .",
    "the primary reason for this discrepancy is that we followed the formation _ history _ of a host halo since @xmath1 , whereas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* font et al . ( 2001 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gauthier et al . ( 2006 ) ) considered the @xmath7 population of surviving substructure present in a cdm halo . as we mentioned above",
    ", this difference is critical because as subhalos on highly eccentric orbits at early epochs continuously lose mass , the fraction of massive satellites with small orbital pericenters that are most capable of severely perturbing the disk declines with redshift so that few remain by @xmath7 .",

    "the face - on view of the final disk in figure  [ fig2 ] reveals the existence of pronounced ring - like features at its outskirts .",
    "these low - density , long - lived dynamically - cold rings are nearly in - plane and are qualitatively similar to the monoceros ring , an intriguing stellar structure known to extend around the mw ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* newberg et al . 2002 ) ) .",

    "<S> we perform a set of high - resolution , fully self - consistent dissipationless @xmath0-body simulations to investigate the influence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) substructure on the dynamical evolution of thin galactic disks . </S>",
    "<S> our method combines cosmological simulations of galaxy - sized cdm halos to derive the properties of substructure populations and controlled numerical experiments of consecutive subhalo impacts onto initially - thin , fully - formed disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that close encounters between massive subhalos and galactic disks since @xmath1 should be common occurrences in models . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , extremely few satellites in present - day cdm halos are likely to have a significant impact on the disk structure . </S>",
    "<S> one typical host halo merger history is used to seed controlled @xmath0-body experiments of subhalo - disk encounters . as a result of these accretion events , </S>",
    "<S> the disk thickens considerably at all radii with the disk scale height increasing in excess of a factor of @xmath2 in the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> we show that interactions with the subhalo population produce a wealth of distinctive morphological signatures in the disk stars , many of which resemble those being discovered in the milky way ( mw ) , m31 , and in other disk galaxies , including : conspicuous flares ; bars ; low - lived , ring - like features in the outskirts ; and low - density , filamentary structures above the disk plane . </S>",
    "<S> we compare a resulting dynamically - cold , ring - like feature in our simulations to the monoceros ring stellar structure in the mw . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison shows quantitative agreement in both spatial distribution and kinematics , suggesting that such observed complex stellar components may arise naturally as disk stars are excited by encounters with subhalos . </S>",
    "<S> these findings highlight the significant role of cdm substructure in setting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution . </S>"
