    "this paper deals with elliptic theory on stratified manifolds with stratification of arbitrary length . analytical aspects of this theory ( notion of symbol , ellipticity condition , finiteness theorem ) are now sufficiently well worked out , at least for pseudodifferential operators of order zero ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us summarize the results obtained in the cited papers ( below we shall only deal with zero - order operators ) .",
    "a stratified manifold is a union of a finite number of open strata .",
    "each stratum is a smooth manifold ; and the strata are glued together in some special way ( see op .",
    "the principal symbol of a pseudodifferential operator in this situation is a collection of symbols on the strata .",
    "each symbol is an operator - valued function , defined on the cotangent bundle ( minus the zero section ) of the corresponding open stratum .",
    "the symbol assigned to the stratum of maximal dimension plays a special role .",
    "this symbol , which is called the _ interior symbol _ of operator , ranges in operators in finite - dimensional vector spaces .",
    "the ellipticity condition requires the invertibility of the principal symbol of the operator , i.e. , invertibility of symbols on all strata .",
    "finiteness theorem asserts that an elliptic operator is fredholm in @xmath0-spaces .",
    "an approach to index formulas , i.e. , formulas , which express index in terms of the principal symbol of the operator was proposed in  @xcite for operators on manifolds with isolated singularities .",
    "the idea of this approach is to obtain formula for the index as a sum of homotopy invariants of symbols on the stratum of maximal dimension and the singular points .",
    "such index formulas were obtained in the cited paper , and for manifolds with edges ( simplest class of stratified manifolds with nonisolated singularities ) in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that to obtain such formulas , one assumes that the symbol of operator is invariant with respect to some transformation of the cotangent bundle of the manifold ( _ symmetry condition _ ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we introduce a class of transformations of cotangent bundles of stratified manifolds , and for an elliptic operator invariant under one of the transformations we give an explicit index formula in terms of homotopy invariants of elliptic symbols on the strata .",
    "let us briefly describe the contents of the paper .",
    "we start with a brief summary of results on the geometry of stratified manifolds and theory of pseudodifferential operators on them , which are used in the following sections ( in our exposition we follow the terminology of the paper  @xcite ) .    in index theory of elliptic operators on stratified manifolds an important role",
    "is played by the surgery method ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this method permits one to localize contributions to the index of symbols on the strata . in this paper , we introduce class of _ surgeries in phase space_. such surgeries are carried out on cotangent bundles of manifolds , rather than manifolds themselves . this surgery technique is treated in sections  [ seca ] and  [ secb ] .",
    "the class of transformations of the cotangent bundle which we consider in this paper has the following important property : transformations from this class naturally act on the algebra of principal symbols of @xmath1do .",
    "we say that an operator satisfies _ symmetry condition _ if its principal symbol is invariant under some mapping from this class ( in what follows transformations are denoted by @xmath2 and operators satisfying symmetry condition are called @xmath2-invariant ) .",
    "then for a @xmath2-invariant operator we construct homotopy invariants for each of the strata of the manifold .",
    "the index formula expresses the index of a @xmath2-invariant elliptic operator as a sum of these homotopy invariants of symbols on the strata .    a couple of words concerning the proof of index theorem . using the homotopy classification of elliptic operators on stratified manifolds @xcite , we compute the contributions to the index of the strata of lower dimensions . to compute the contribution of the stratum of maximal dimension , we use surgery in phase space .    note , finally , that the application of surgery method in  @xcite was substantially hindered , because the symmetry condition could only be satisfied for operators , for which the atiyah ",
    "bott obstruction @xcite is equal to zero . in the present paper",
