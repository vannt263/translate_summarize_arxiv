    "recall that the degree of the cyclotomic extension @xmath4 is given by euler s @xmath13-function @xmath14 , with the following formula : if @xmath15 for distinct primes @xmath16 , then @xmath17 the @xmath0-vector space @xmath4 gives rise to a natural matroid @xmath1 , represented by the @xmath5 vectors @xmath18 and having rank @xmath14 .",

    "bolker  @xcite was the first to study the simplicial matroid @xmath39 , where the @xmath33 are positive integers , not necessarily prime .",
    "he proposed the bases of this matroid as higher - dimensional analogues of spanning trees in bipartite graphs , and studied their relation to vertices of certain transportation polytopes .",
    "each such basis @xmath40 of @xmath39 gives rise to a @xmath0-acyclic pure @xmath28-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath41 , obtained by attaching the @xmath28-simplices indexed by @xmath40 to the @xmath42-skeleton of @xmath29 .",
    "he also suggested @xmath43 as an upper bound for the number of bases , and showed that this formula gives the exact number of bases if and only if at most two of the @xmath33 exceed @xmath44 .",

    "the method of adin and kalai is to generalize the classical kirchhoff matrix - tree theorem to simplicial complexes , using the binet - cauchy determinant formula : this yields the result @xmath46 that is , bolker s formula   is an _ exact _",
    "count for such bases with the following weighting : instead of a basis @xmath40 contributing @xmath22 to the count , its contribution is the square of the order of its integral homology group in codimension  @xmath22 .    combining the results of adin and bolker with theorem  [ main - theorem ] , and the fact that dual matroids have the same number of bases , one immediately obtains the following corollary .",

    "we first state a well - known general fact about matroids , to be used in the proof .    [",

    ".2 in    to give some further context for theorem  [ main - theorem ] , it should be noted that matroid duality has played a key role in the study of simplicial matroids from the beginning .",
    "crapo and rota studied the full simplicial matroid @xmath98 corresponding to the @xmath99-skeleton of the full simplex with @xmath100 vertices , and observed that alexander duality implies that @xmath101 and @xmath98 are dual matroids ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 11.4 ) ( see also ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.2.1 ) ) .",
    "lindstrm @xcite observed another interesting example of such a duality , this time involving two natural matroids ( one of them simplicial ) , both of whose ground sets are indexed by the bases of some ( other ) simple matroid ; see  @xcite .",
    ".2 in    it has been observed ( e.g. , by johnsen @xcite ) that the primitive @xmath2 roots of unity form a @xmath0-basis for @xmath4 if and only if @xmath5 is square - free .",
    "thus if @xmath102 is square - free , one might ask which particular basis of the simplicial matroid @xmath38 ( that is , which higher - dimensional tree @xmath40 of @xmath103 ) corresponds to the set of primitive @xmath2 roots . passing through matroid duality , and the chinese remainder theorem identification in the proof of the theorem , one can check that @xmath40 is the union of the stars within @xmath103 of the vertices @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the unique vertex of @xmath106 labeled by @xmath30 modulo @xmath16 . applying a simple nerve argument to this cover of @xmath40 by stars",
    ", one finds that @xmath40 is not only @xmath0-acyclic as expected , but in fact contractible .",
    "hence it has vanishing homology group @xmath107 , and contributes exactly @xmath22 in the summation of equation .",
    ".2 in    if @xmath5 is divisible by at most two primes ( that is , @xmath108 above ) , then the complex @xmath109 is a graph . in this case , the matroid @xmath1 is _ cographic _ ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , and section  [ two - primes - section ] below ) .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath5 is odd , then the cyclotomic matroid @xmath110 is the parallel extension of @xmath1 in which one creates one parallel copy for each ground set element . for instance , @xmath1 is again cographic for @xmath111 , where @xmath112 are odd primes : it is the cographic matroid of the graph obtained by duplicating every edge of the complete bipartite graph @xmath113 .",
    "the goal of this section is to compute some enumerative invariants of the cyclotomic matroid @xmath1 , finer than the number of bases , in the special case where @xmath52 has only two prime factors .",
