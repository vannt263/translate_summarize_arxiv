    "theoretically , the question remains whether a traditional potential scattering formalism@xcite or more strongly correlated models@xcite are needed to describe the impurity effects . though still a subject of controversy , it was recently shown that at least for _ weak _ impurities a potential scattering scenario qualitatively agrees with the measured results for optimally doped bscco@xcite .",

    "there is also evidence from nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements that magnetic moments are induced around nonmagnetic impurities@xcite . in this paper we assume , however , that the large potential scattering off the impurity site _ itself _ is dominating the final ldos .",
    "+ recently the experimental ability to manipulate the positions of surface impurities has increased the interest in quantum interference phenomena between multiple impurities .",

    "motivated by the experimental progress we compare the expected ldos around one and two strong nonmagnetic impurities in either the d - wave superconducting ( dsc ) or the d - density wave ( ddw ) state . though still controversial we include the filter effect in all the calculations presented below .",
    "as has become clear only recently@xcite , we stress that the probed impurities need be well separated ( 10 - 50 lattice constants ) from other possible defects .",
    "+ the ddw state was recently proposed as a model for the pseudo - gap state of the cuprates@xcite .",
    "any difference in the impurity modified ldos between the dsc and ddw states may reveal the hidden ddw order and distinguish between the scenario of preformed pairs versus static staggered orbital currents as the origin for the pseudo - gap state@xcite .",

    "the large value of the gap corresponds roughly to the experimentally measured maximum gap in the underdoped regime of bscco .",

    "( [ ddwgreens ] ) gives @xmath21 e^{i{\\mathbf{k}}\\cdot ( { \\mathbf{r}}_i-{\\mathbf{r}}_j)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the sum extending over the reduced brillouin zone .",

    "this @xmath29 generates resonances at a few mev for a single nonmagnetic impurity@xcite .",
    "the large scale of this potential renders the effects on the ldos from corrections to other energy scales around the impurity site less important .",
    "for instance , we have checked that gap suppression near the impurity or slightly larger spatial extension of the impurity does not qualitatively affect the results reported below . in general these effects tend to push the resonances slightly further towards zero bias .",
    "we have also performed calculations ( not shown here ) with other values of @xmath29 and comment on the results below .",
    "+ the full greens function @xmath30 in the presence of the impurities can be obtained by solving the real - space gorkov - dyson equation @xmath31 the size of the matrices in this equation depends on the number of impurities and the dimension of the nambu space .",

    "it is still controversial which quasi - particle energy applies to the dsc and ddw states@xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath8 is important since it will influence the final ldos around the impurities .",
    "we illustrate this in the following by studying two generic band structures : the nested situation , and a @xmath37-@xmath38 band believed to be relevant for bscco around @xmath39 hole doping . with the notation @xmath40 , and",

    "22 there are physical reasons to expect the nested band to be relevant for the ddw state and the @xmath37-@xmath38 band for the dsc phase .",
    "however , recent photoemission measurements on lsco by zhou _",
    "et al._@xcite observed a fermi surface consisting of straight lines connecting the antinodal regions which may indicate that the nested band is more relevant for impurity studies in lsco .",
    "thus we find it important for study both cases below .",

    "[ 1impdsc ] was for @xmath27 .",
    "though of less experimental relevance , we briefly mention another difference between the dsc and ddw states .",
    "this relates to the fate of the resonance in the unitary limit , @xmath57 : for the ddw phase the resonance energy approaches minus the chemical potential , @xmath58 , whereas it approaches the fermi level in the dsc phase ( except for a small residual energy shift caused by a possible particle - hole asymmetry@xcite ) .",
    "the different resonance energy ( as @xmath57 ) arises from the way the chemical potential enters the bands of the clean ddw ( @xmath59 ) and dsc ( @xmath60 ) states@xcite .",
    "+      in general when several impurities are in close proximity the resonances split , and one expects to see additional peaks in the density of states .",
    "the evolution of the ldos as a function of distance and angular orientation between two nonmagnetic impurities in the dsc state has been already studied by several authors@xcite . in the following",
    "we elaborate on this work by a numerical study of the ldos including the filtering effect and study for the first time the quantum interference between two strong nonmagnetic impurities in the ddw state . in the superconducting phase fig .",
    "[ dscnested]a shows the resulting ldos for the nested band when one impurity is fixed at the origin @xmath61 while the other is moved out along a crystal axis to @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "[ dscnested]b the impurities are fixed at @xmath63 and @xmath64 while the stm tip is moved from @xmath61 to @xmath65 . as seen from both figures",
    "there are strong variations in the ldos in agreement with previous studies without the extra tunnelling effect@xcite .    =    =    the number of apparent resonances , their energetic position and width strongly depend on the impurity configuration and the position of the stm tip .",
    "in particular , for certain impurity separations the resonances completely disappear . in fig .",
    "[ ddwnested ] we show the ldos for the same impurity and stm positions as in fig . [",
    "dscnested ] but for the ddw state",
    ". clearly , strong quantum interference between the two nonmagnetic impurities also exists in this state .",
    "however , by comparison with fig [ dscnested ] it is evident that the additional resonance states in the dsc allows one to distinguish this from the ddw phase .",
    "we have performed identical calculations to the ones presented in fig .",
    "[ dscnested]-[ddwnested ] for other ( but still large ) values of the scattering potential @xmath29 , and always find qualitatively the same interference pattern . +",
    "as mentioned above , the resonances split when two impurities are in close proximity .",
    "it is therefore nontrivial that only a single , nondispersive peak is seen in e.g. fig .",
    "[ ddwnested]b .",
    "this is closely connected to the particular stm scan and one may worry about the robustness of this result .",
    "however , we always find that whenever the impurity positions are invariant under mirror reflection through the stm scan line , only a single nondispersive peak remains@xcite in the ddw state .",
    "importantly , for these same configurations we find the alternating double peak structure ( similar to fig .",
    "[ dscnested]b,[dscnotnested]b ) to be a robust feature in the superconducting phase . furthermore ,",
    "as expected for a d - wave gap@xcite , we find ( not shown ) that the quantum interference patterns are longer ranged along the nodal directions than along the cu - o bonds . +",
    "as expected from the discussion of the single impurity in the ddw state , we end this section by noting that when @xmath66 , @xmath67 the interference pattern is identical to that shown in fig .",

    "[ dscnested ] .",

    "we note that despite the very different band structure used to calculate the ldos in fig .",
    "[ dscnested ] and fig .",
    "[ dscnotnested ] , the overall evolution of the resonances is quite similar except that the apparent resonances are shifted to higher energies for the @xmath37-@xmath38 band .",

    "furthermore , the ldos shown in fig . [ ddwnotnested ] changes only slightly upon varying @xmath29 or the impurity positions .",
    "in summary we have shown that a systematic stm study around two nonmagnetic impurities can clearly distinguish the dsc and ddw phases .",
    "in particular , we suggest to perform stm scans with the positions of the impurities being invariant under a mirror reflection through the scan line . even for the nested band , where the clean and the single impurity ldos are not a good probe for the underlying state , this situation provides a robust test for dsc versus ddw order .",

    "in particular , within models explaining the single impurity ldos as a kondo resonance arising from a confined spinon@xcite , one may expect more novel changes as the distance between two nonmagnetic impurities is decreased .",
