    "it is well - known that the sunspot penumbra ( the outer part of sunspots ) has a very complicate filamentary structure and a strong non - stationary outflow .",
    "this outflow is responsible for the so - called evershed effect , a doppler shift of the spectral lines emerging from sunspots @xcite .",
    "the magnetic structure of the penumbra can be represented as a mixture of two magnetic field components with different inclinations and strengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the radial evershed flow ( in particular , the high - speed evershed coluds ) is associated with the more strongly inclined , almost horizontal field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , significant progress in our understanding of the evershed effect was made by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "these studies suggested that the evershed flow is a consequence of overturning magnetoconvection in the presence of inclined magnetic fields , and that the driving mechanism is associated with traveling convective waves that propagate in the direction of the magnetic field inclination @xcite .",
    "the issue is not resolved and other interpretations are possible ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is important to confront the simulations with as many observations as possible .    in this letter",
    ", we examine the idea that the sea - serpent penumbral field lines detected by @xcite in high - resolution hinode measurements are related to the same mechanism of overturning convection and traveling convective waves in a strong inclined magnetic field .",
    "our analysis is based on the radiative mhd simulations of @xcite .",
    "analyses of visible and near - infrared spectro - polarimetric observations from the ground revealed that in the mid and outer penumbra the evershed flows are directed downward and have magnetic polarities opposite to that of the spot ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see bellot rubio 2009 for a detailed description ) .",
    "the spectro - polarimeter aboard hinode @xcite made it possible to identify isolated magnetic patches of opposite polarity associated with strong , even supersonic , evershed downflows @xcite .",
    "this provided a beautiful confirmation of the results obtained from ground - based observations at lower resolution .",
    "@xcite then discovered that the opposite polarity patches move radially outward , often accompanied by another patch having the polarity of the spot and being located further away from the umbra . @xcite and @xcite also detected the evolution of reversed - polarity patches in the penumbra using soho / mdi observations @xcite , but their bipolar nature could not be established . taken together ,",
    "these results provide an indication that the moving magnetic features observed in the penumbra and the evershed flow belong to the same physical mechanism .",
    "the magnetic patches move between the more vertical filaments of the penumbra with a typical velocity of @xmath0 km / s , their length is 23 arcsec , the mean width is @xmath1 arcsec , and they have a lifetime of 0.5  7 hours @xcite . sometimes , the bipolar pairs appear one behind another along the same filament . this can be the signature of a wave - like behavior , similar to the wave behavior of magnetoconvection in the penumbra found in numerical simulations @xcite .    based on the observational data , @xcite proposed a sea - serpent model which explains the existence of moving bipolar structures as wavering magnetic field lines . in this model ,",
    "almost horizontal field lines return to the solar interior and then come back to the photosphere , thus forming bipolar patches .",
    "this scenario is similar to that discussed by schlichenmaier ( 2002 ) in the context of the moving tube model .",
    "it is also similar to the model proposed by @xcite for moving magnetic features in the sunspot moat ( mmfs ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , it has been suggested that mmfs represent the continuation of similar features in the penumbra @xcite .",
    "for numerical simulations of sunspot penumbra conditions we use the 3d radiative mhd code `` solarbox '' @xcite .",
    "this code takes into account all essential physics and includes sub - grid scale turbulence modeling based on the large - eddy simulation ( les ) approach .",
    "a dynamic smagorinsky turbulence model provides the best agreement with observations in terms of the acoustic oscillation power .",
    "however , in these simulations we use a computationally more efficient hyperviscosity model , because it shows results qualitatively very similar to the dynamic model .",
    "the code uses a real - gas equation of state , takes into account ionization and excitation of all abundant species in the lte approximation , and includes radiative transfer and magnetic effects @xcite .",
    "we simulate the behavior of solar magnetoconvection for an initial background magnetic field of various strengths , from 600 to 2000  g , but with the same inclination of @xmath2 to the vertical axis .",
    "our previous results have shown that these condition provide a very good model for the evershed effect @xcite .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath3  mm@xmath4 and the grid resolution is 50  km .",
    "the results were verified using a higher resolution of 25  km and a larger horizontal size of 25  mm .",
    "the lateral boundary conditions are periodic , and we keep the mean initial inclination of the field in the whole box domain by setting up top and bottom boundary conditions that conserve the total magnetic flux , but locally the field strength and inclination can freely change .",
    "the magnetic field strongly influences convective motions .",
    "for instance , in the case of vertical magnetic fields , convective granules become smaller with increasing field strength @xcite and also move faster , generating more high - frequency turbulence @xcite .",
    "a strong inclined magnetic field deforms the granules , making them elongated along the field lines .",
    "when the field becomes almost horizontal the convective cells form a filamentary structure , and high - speed flows ( reaching 5 - 6 km / s ) appear in the direction of the magnetic field inclination @xcite .",
    "these flows share many similarities with the observed evershed flows , including their nearly - supersonic speeds .",
    "for illustration of our results we use a simulation run with initial magnetic field of @xmath5  g and inclination angle of @xmath6 pointing in the direction of the horizontal @xmath7-axis .",
    "figure  [ 2d ] shows a time sequence of 2d snapshots of the horizontal and vertical components of the magnetic field , @xmath8 , and velocity , @xmath9 , with 8-min cadence for five time moments : 0 , 8 , 16 , 24 and 32 mins .",
    "the overplotted curves are projections of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the black and white areas seen in the vertical magnetic field ( fig .  [ 2d]a ) correspond to patches of negative and positive polarities .",
    "the horizontal magnetic field component ( fig .  [ 2d]b ) shows variations of the magnetic filamentary structure , which is a result of magnetoconvection in the inclined field .",
    "the dark areas correspond to  magnetic gaps \" , areas with a weaker ( but not zero ) magnetic field , that correspond to observations @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the areas of weaker horizontal magnetic field correspond to the transitions between negative and positive polarities of the vertical field . in these transition regions , strong downward flows",
    "are observed ( fig .",
    "the transition regions are also characterized by strong @xmath10 km / s horizontal velocities ( fig .  [ 2d]d ) .",
    "the strongest horizontal flow in the direction of the magnetic field inclination is associated with the negative polarities .",
    "the correlation between downflows and negative polarity patches is in agreement with the observations , which show that the downward penumbral motions occur along magnetic fields returning back to the solar surface @xcite .",
    "figure  [ 3d ] displays the 3d structure of magnetic field lines ( red curves ) , temperature variations , and the velocity field ( arrows ) .",
    "the top horizontal slice corresponds to the solar surface .",
    "the results demonstrate a strong coupling between the fluid flow and magnetic field .",
    "in particular , the upflows correspond to magnetic field lines rising above the surface ( positive polarity ) while the downward flows correlate with the negative polarity .",
    "this corresponds very well to the observed properties of the penumbra and the sea - serpent model .",
    "in this letter , we have used the results of numerical simulations of magnetoconvection in strong inclined magnetic field to interpret polarimetric observations of a sunspot penumbra .",
    "the results reproduce the moving bipolar magnetic elements observed in high - resolution soho / mdi and hinode / sot data and also their properties , supporting the sea - serpent model proposed by @xcite .",
    "the simulations explain the sea - serpent structure and dynamics of the penumbral field as a consequence of solar magnetoconvection in a highly inclined , strong magnetic field , which forms filamentary structures and has properties of traveling convective wave .",
    "the physical picture schematically illustrated in figure  [ scheme ] is the following .",
    "convective cells in sunspot penumbrae are deformed under the action of the inclined magnetic field , forming filamentary structures and producing high - speed evershed flows @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field lines are stretched by the downward flows and dragged under the surface .",
    "the points where the magnetic field lines cross the solar surface are observed as magnetic patches of positive and negative polarities .",
    "note that the negative patch is closer to the umbra , in agreement with the observations .",
    "the convective cells move in the direction of the magnetic field inclination because of the traveling convective wave behavior .",
    "therefore , the bipolar magnetic patches also move in the same direction .",
    "thus , the numerical simulations connect the sea - serpent structure of the moving bipolar magnetic pathes observed in the penumbra with the process of overturning magnetoconvection , traveling convective waves , and the evershed flow .",
