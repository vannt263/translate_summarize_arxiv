    "the strong observational evidence for an accelerating universe  @xcite has sparked a widespread search for a dynamical explanation . beyond a bare cosmological constant ,",
    "a plethora of other models have been proposed , with quintessence - a dynamical scalar field that behaves essentially as a modern day inflaton field , - being perhaps the simplest example ( see  @xcite ) . in this context , many potentials have been introduced that yield late - time acceleration and tracking behaviour ( see  @xcite ) .    among other approaches ,",
    "modified gravity models have attracted great interest ( see  @xcite ) but also some criticism , partly because they were introduced as purely phenomenological models , but more seriously because it was not clear that they possessed a satisfactory newtonian limit in the solar system , or that they were free of ghosts ( see  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the propagating degrees of freedom of the so - called cddett model @xcite . there already exist detailed studies of the newtonian limit  @xcite and the supernovae contraints  @xcite for this model . here",
    "we derive conditions that they be free of ghosts , and that they have a real propagation speed less than or equal to that of light .    as we review below",
    ", a transformation of the action shows that modified gravity models are equivalent to a number of scalar fields linearly coupled to higher order curvature invariants . in the case",
    "in which these curvature invariants are fourth order , the relevant one for the modified gravity models of refs .",
    "@xcite , we obtain conditions for the propagating degrees of freedom to be well - behaved in their late - time attractor solutions ( friedmann - robertson walker spacetimes with accelerating expansion ) .",
    "this extends previous work which established their consistency in de sitter backgrounds @xcite .",
    "we find that while untroubled by ghosts , the accelerating power - law attractors in general have superluminal tensor and scalar modes , which may place severe theoretical constraints on these models .",
    "our starting point is the action proposed in  @xcite , which we write in the form @xmath0 \\ , \\label{starta}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a constant , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we have introduced @xmath5 for generality , but note that its presence does not change the late time behaviour of the accelerating attractors , since for an accelerating universe both the @xmath6 ( einstein - hilbert ) term and the dark matter density become negligible ( in other words the exponent of the power law attractor does not depend on @xmath7 , see  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we take the function @xmath8 to be of the form @xmath9 where a sum over @xmath10 is implied .",
    "the action  ( [ starta ] ) can be written as that of einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field , a form more suitable for analysing the propagating degrees of freedom ( see the appendix for a general analysis ) .",
    "consider @xmath11\\ , \\label{step1}\\ ] ] where , of course , @xmath12 , otherwise the action is not finite .",
    "the variation of this action with respect to @xmath13 leads to @xmath14 and , using this relation , action  ( [ step1 ] ) and action  ( [ starta ] ) yield the same equations of motion .",
    "note that when @xmath15 and @xmath16 , this action is equivalent to einstein - hilbert gravity coupled to a single scalar through a gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term @xmath17 .",
    "the coupling of a scalar field with a quadratic expression of the curvature invariants emerges naturally in the context of string theory .",
    "in particular , as was shown in  @xcite by gross and sloan , in the low - energy effective action the dilaton is coupled to a gauss - bonnet term .",
    "it is well known that such a term , expanded about a minkowski vacuum , ensures that the theory is ghost - free ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it might then seem that taking the @xmath18 to be the gb combination is a sensible choice , because string theory predicts such a coupling to exist and string theory does not have ghosts .",
    "however , in models like ours , for which minkowski spacetime is not a solution , choosing the gb combination of parameters @xmath18 is not a sufficient condition for the non - existence of ghosts .",
    "a ghost is a propagating degree of freedom whose propagator has the wrong sign , and which therefore gives rise to a negative norm state on quantisation .",
    "such states are allowed off - shell in gauge field perturbation theory , but are unacceptable as physical particles . a theory of gravity with fourth order derivatives in the kinetic term inevitably has ghosts @xcite , but even a theory with second order derivatives alone has other potential problems .",
    "once we break lorentz invariance , as in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background , the kinetic terms of a field , even though second order in derivatives , may still have the wrong sign , or may give rise to a propagation speed which is greater than 1 , or imaginary . to see this in more detail ,",
    "consider the action for a scalar field @xmath13 , s = d^4 x ( 12t(t ) ^2 - 12s(t ) ^2 )  .",
    "[ e : problem_action ] the propagation speed of this scalar is @xmath19 .",
    "one may wish to impose one or more of the following conditions    1 .   a real propagation speed : @xmath20 , otherwise all perturbations have exponentially growing modes . 2 .",
    "a propagation speed less than light : @xmath21 , we will talk about this issue more in detail in section iii .",
    "3 .   no ghosts : @xmath22 , to ensure a consistent quantum field theory .    clearly ,",
    "unless @xmath23 and @xmath24 are positive , and their ratio less than one , we will have instabilities , superluminal propagation , or ghosts .",
    "we will see that in studying the action for small perturbations of the metric in modified gravity theories we will generally encounter actions of the form ( [ e : problem_action ] ) .",
    "if @xmath25 , the action  ( [ starta ] ) can be written in terms of an einstein - hilbert term plus a particular extra piece involving two new scalar fields . furthermore , because of the special properties of the gauss - bonnet term , the equations of motion are no longer 4th order , but remain 2nd order in the fields .",
    "taking the action  ( [ step1 ] ) and introducing a new scalar field @xmath26 , we have s = d^4 x\\{[+2bf()]r - u()-b^2f()+f()r^2_gb } [ hn1 ]  , where u()&=&_^4n+2 + f()&=&a_3_^4n+2n^n+1  , with @xmath27 , and @xmath28 the gauss - bonnet invariant .    making a field redefinition @xmath29 , the equation of motion for @xmath30 is @xmath31 , and the gravitational equations then become & ( + ) r _ - _ _ + g_-2r__f + 2g_rf + 8r_(_)^f & + & -4r_f-4g_r^__f - 4r_(^_)__f-12g_=0  . & independent of the background , after application of the bianchi indentities these equations are second - order in derivatives of the fields , thanks to the gauss - bonnet combination .    it is known that adding terms quadratic in the curvature invariants to the einstein - hilbert action with a cosmological constant yields an extra scalar mode and a spin-2 mode , which is generically a ghost because of its fourth - order field equation ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , provided we are expanding around a constant @xmath13 background , such as de sitter space , we can directly infer that modifed gravity models are generically afflicted by spin-2 ghosts .",
    "however , in our case , it is clear that the higher derivative terms cancel out identically because @xmath15 , as was already found in  @xcite .",
    "the remaining extra scalar degree of freedom , @xmath30 , is due to the presence of the extra @xmath32 term in the lagrangian , which vanishes if @xmath16 .",
    "crucially though , the vanishing of the fourth order term is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the absence of ghosts in the spin-2 sector . as we described above",
    ", one must also separately check the signs of the second order derivatives with respect to both time and space ( a check was not performed in @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we derive and study the kinetic terms for both the spin 0 and spin 2 fields in time - dependent backgrounds , to which derivatives of @xmath33 contribute .",
    "we find that both fields may be afflicted by instabilities or ghosts , contrary to the claim of the absence of ghosts in frw spacetimes made in @xcite .",
    "we show that the special case of an empty accelerating universe  the late - time attractor of an frw cosmology in the modified gravity model under consideration  the propagating states are generically ( but not universally ) superluminal over the @xmath34 parameter space .",
    "if the second order derivatives of the spin-2 and spin-0 fields do not have the correct signs in frw spacetimes , then the theory may be inconsistent .",
    "the existence of a ghost mode would lead , for example , to the over - production of all particles coupled to it .",
    "one may think of a theory with ghosts as an effective theory , with no ghosts above some cutoff , thereby restoring consistency ( see  @xcite ) . however , this cut - off must be less than about 3 mev @xcite .",
    "a further condition that one may wish to impose is that the propagation speeds be less than or equal to unity .",
    "one worry is that the existence of superluminal modes on the relevant cosmological backgrounds may lead to a catastrophic signature of causality violation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "other authors  @xcite ) have discussed the problem of superluminal propagation in non - lorentzian backgrounds and , in particular , have suggested that the presence of superluminal modes would introduce a second horizon , the so called sound horizon , different from the light causal horizon , which may lead to ambiguities and inconsistencies in black - hole thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out ( @xcite ) that for some set of initial conditions , superluminal modes may yield ill - posed cauchy problems . in particular , in our case , nothing prevents @xmath35 and  @xmath36 - the respective speeds of the scalar and tensor modes - becoming infinite . in general",
    "this would lead to causally connected spatial sections and eventually to an ill - posed cauchy problem .    on the other hand , in the context of non - commutative geometry",
    ", other authors have studied superluminal propagation and shown that there is no causality violation if there is a preferred reference frame  @xcite .",
    "given these different possibilities , in this paper we will present the constraints from superluminal propagation in a clearly distinct way from those arising from ghosts , so as to allow readers to impose fewer or more constraints , depending on the particular theory they are working with .      in this section",
    "we begin with the special case @xmath37 which we refer to as the modified gb action .",

    "therefore , in terms of physical time , @xmath60 and planck units @xmath61 , the condition that a background have a real and non - superluminal spin-2 propagation speed is 0c_2 ^ 2 = 1  , [ spin2speed ] [ cond1 ] where a dot indicates a derivative with respect to @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",

    "these conditions put additional bounds on the parameter space spanned by the @xmath81 which define the cddett modified gravity theories , if we require that they hold at all times during the evolution of the universe .",
