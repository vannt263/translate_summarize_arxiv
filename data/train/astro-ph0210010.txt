    "[ eq : pmresp ] is infinite ( assuming @xmath56 ) , properties of the bessel functions  which define the magnitude of the fourier amplitudes of the sidebands  give a rather sharp cutoff at @xmath57 sidebands ( or @xmath58 pairs of sidebands ) .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath51 also occurs near @xmath59 at a value of @xmath60 , which gives the phase modulation response its distinctive `` horned '' shape when @xmath19 is large ( see fig .  [ fig : phsmod ] ) .",

    "@xcite performed a detailed analysis of phase modulated optical pulsations in the small amplitude limit from the 7.7second x - ray pulsar 4u  1626 - 67 in order to solve for the orbital parameters of the system .",
    "the separation of the sidebands provided a measurement of the @xmath71min orbital period and the magnitudes and phases of the three significant fourier peaks allowed them to solve for @xmath19 ( and therefore @xmath72 ) and @xmath20 directly .",
    "small amplitude phase modulation might also be observed from freely precessing neutron stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for certain geometries , the geometric wobble of the pulsar beam would periodically modulate the pulse arrival times and cause the system to appear as a compact binary .",
    "if such rapidly precessing objects exist , they would display a small number ( @xmath73 ) of pairs of sidebands in a power spectrum of a long observation , since the maximum possible phase modulation amplitude for such a system is @xmath74radians @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived a fourier expansion for elliptical orbital motion with the useful property that the magnitudes of higher order harmonics of the orbital expansion ( which correspond to independent modulation amplitudes @xmath75 ) decrease monotonically . in the limit of circular",
    "orbits the expansion reduces to the single phase modulating sinusoid found in eqn .",
    "[ eq : pmsig ] .",
    "each harmonic of the orbital modulation generates sidebands around the spin harmonic of the form discussed in ",
    "[ sec : circular ] .",
    "the sidebands created by harmonic @xmath76 of the orbital expansion are separated from each other by @xmath77 fourier bins .",
    "since @xmath78 monotonically decreases with increasing orbital harmonic @xmath76 , the number of sidebands generated decreases while their spacing and average amplitudes increase .",
    "the most important aspect of this superposition of sidebands is the fact that the fourier response near a spin harmonic contains sidebands spaced by @xmath45 fourier bins  from the fundamental of the orbital expansion  just as in the limiting case of circular orbits .",
    "figures  [ fig : pvsporb ] and  [ fig : histograms ] show @xmath79 , @xmath1 , and @xmath19 for 54 binary pulsars from the literature , all with orbital periods less than 10 days .",
    "a few conclusions can be reached immediately .",
    "first , radio millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are the most common binary pulsar .",
    "second , there is a relatively flat distribution of @xmath1 for radio pulsars which cuts off quite dramatically near @xmath80d ( @xmath81h )  the two systems with shorter orbital periods are the recently discovered accreting x - ray msps xte  j1751 - 314 @xcite and xte  j0929 - 314 @xcite . and third , a large fraction of the systems are located in globular clusters .    the fact that large numbers of relatively compact binary pulsar systems should contain msps is not surprising in light of the standard `` recycling '' model for msp creation @xcite .",
    "this model explains not only the preponderance of pulsars with millisecond spin periods , but also the fact that many msps have low - mass ( @xmath82 ) companion stars in compact circular orbits .",
    "these recycled systems make up the vast majority of the pulsars shown in figure  [ fig : pvsporb ] and have typical values of @xmath19 of @xmath83 to a few times @xmath84radians .",
    "the cutoff in @xmath1 at approximately two hours is almost certainly due in some part to selection effects .",
    "the rapid orbital motion of these systems prevents their detection using conventional search techniques  including acceleration searches  for all but the brightest systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , the only msps discovered with shorter orbital periods ( @xmath85min for both xte  j1751 - 314 and xte  j0929 - 314 ) were discovered during transient x - ray outbursts when the pulsed fractions were very high @xcite . since selection effects keep us from detecting ultra - compact systems that are not exceptionally bright , it is difficult to determine how much the observed lack of such systems is due to a true lack of compact systems .",
    "it is certain that neutron star ( ns ) systems with much shorter orbital periods _ do _  exist , as the new accreting x - ray msps and other ultra - compact lmxbs such as 4u  1820@xmath86303 ( @xmath87min ) , 4u  1850@xmath86087 ( @xmath88min ) , 4u  1627@xmath86673 ( @xmath89min ) , and 4u  1916@xmath86053 ( @xmath90min ) @xcite have shown .    the large fraction of known systems inhabiting globular clusters can be explained by three basic facts .",
    "first , due to their known location on the sky , long targeted observations of clusters allow fainter systems to be detected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "second , repeated observations of certain clusters have allowed many very weak pulsars to be detected with the help of amplification from interstellar scintillation @xcite .",
    "finally , large numbers of binary pulsars are expected to have been created in globular clusters due to dynamical interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite have conducted extensive population synthesis studies for binary pulsars in dense globular clusters like 47  tucanae .",
    "their initial results imply that exchange interactions among primordial binaries will produce large numbers of nss in binary systems .",
    "in fact , their results predict that large populations of binary pulsars with low mass companions ( @xmath91 ) should exist in many globular clusters with orbital periods as short as @xmath92min .",
    "the evidence seems to suggest that a large population of ultra - compact binary pulsars should exist  particularly in globular clusters  which have so far eluded detection . with long observations ,",
    "these pulsars will be detected if search algorithms can identify the distinctive sidebands generated by the systems .",
    "the rest of this paper discusses such an algorithm .",
    "the fact that power from an orbitally modulated sinusoid is split into multiple sidebands allows us to increase the signal - to - noise of the detected response by incoherently summing the sidebands . according to one of the addition theorems of bessel functions",
    "@xmath93 theoretically _ all _  of the signal power can be recovered in this manner for noiseless data . practically , though , complete recovery of signal power is not possible for data with a finite signal - to - noise ratio",
    " especially if @xmath94 .",
    "such a summation would require calculation of the @xmath57 significant sidebands at the precise fourier frequencies of their peaks @xmath95 .",
    "this computationally daunting task would result in very large numbers of independent search trials when @xmath19 , @xmath15 , and @xmath45 are unknown .",
    "even if we could recover all of the power using a sum of the sidebands , the significance of the measurement would be less than the significance of a non - modulated sinusoid with the same fourier power .",
    "this loss in significance is due to the fact that noise is co - added along with signal .",
    "the exact loss in significance can easily be calculated since the probability for a sum of @xmath96 noise powers to exceed some power @xmath97 is the probability for a @xmath98 distribution of @xmath99 degrees of freedom to exceed @xmath100 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    in the case where only a few sidebands are suspected to be present ( i.e. @xmath101 )",
    ", a brute - force search using incoherent sideband summing may be computationally feasible and worthwhile . unfortunately , except for binary x - ray pulsars with long spin periods and possibly certain freely precessing nss ( see  [ sec : smallamp ] ) , the number of astrophysical systems with @xmath101 is probably small compared to those with @xmath94 ( see  [ sec : astro ] ) .      for systems with @xmath94 ,",
    "the large number of regularly spaced sidebands allows a very efficient detection scheme .",
    "_ since the sidebands are separated from each other by @xmath45 fourier bins , they appear as a localized periodicity in the power spectrum of the original time series which can be detected with a second stage of fourier analysis . _ by stepping through the full length power spectrum and taking short fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) of the powers , we incoherently sum any sidebands present and efficiently detect their periodic nature . as an added benefit , the measured `` frequency '' of these `` sideband pulsations '' gives a direct and accurate measurement of the _ orbital _  period .",
    "we define the following notation to represent the two distinct stages of the fourier analysis for detecting a phase modulated signal . as defined in eqn .",
    "[ eq : pmsig ] , the initial time series @xmath102 contains @xmath25 points .",
    "after fourier transforming the @xmath102 ( usually using an fft of length @xmath25 ) , the complex responses at fourier frequencies @xmath21 are represented by @xmath103 as defined in eqn .",
    "[ eq : ftdef ] .",
    "the powers and phases are then simply @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively .",
    "the short ffts of the @xmath104 used to detect the sideband pulsations ( i.e.  the _ secondary _ power spectrum ) are of length @xmath106 ( where @xmath107 and should closely match the extent of the sideband structure in the original power spectrum ) and generate complex responses @xmath108 , powers @xmath109 , and phases @xmath110 .    in order for a pulsed signal to undergo enough modulation to produce periodic sidebands ,",
    "the observation must contain more than one complete orbit ( i.e. @xmath111 ) .",
    "one might initially think that two complete orbits would be necessary to create a nyquist sampled series of sidebands in the original power spectrum .",
    "however , since the sideband pulsations are not bandwidth limited , periodic signals with `` wavelengths '' less than two fourier bins ( i.e. @xmath112 ) will still appear in the @xmath109 . instead of appearing at fourier frequency @xmath113 as for signals with @xmath114 ( see  [ sec :",
    "determination ] ) , the fundamental harmonic of the response will appear aliased around the nyquist frequency ( @xmath115 ) at @xmath116 . while @xmath111 is required to begin to produce periodic sidebands , simulations have shown that this technique realistically requires @xmath117 to create _",
    "detectable _ sidebands from most binary systems during reasonable observations .    as the number of orbits present in the data ( @xmath45 ) increases",
    ", so does the spacing ( in fourier bins ) between the sidebands . since each sideband has a traditional sinc  function shape in @xmath108 ( see  [ sec : circular ] )",
    ", the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of a sideband is approximately one fourier bin .",
    "therefore , an increase in spacing effectively decreases the duty - cycle of the sideband pulsations ( i.e. @xmath118 ) .",
    "signals with small duty - cycles are easier to detect for two reasons .",
    "first , significant higher harmonics begin to appear in @xmath109 which can be incoherently summed in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a rule - of - thumb for the number of higher harmonics present in @xmath109 is approximately one - half the inverse of the duty - cycle ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "second , as the duty - cycle decreases , the fourier amplitudes of each harmonic increase in magnitude up to a maximum of twice that of a sinusoid with an identical pulsed fraction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more detailed discussion of pulse duty - cycle effects ) .",
    "this effect makes each individual harmonic easier to detect as @xmath45 increases .",
    "as the number of orbits present in a time series increases , the signal - to - noise ratio of a detectable pulsar spin harmonic goes approximately as @xmath120 where @xmath121 ( see figures  [ fig : sim2ms ] and [ fig : sim20ms ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the signal - to - noise ratio of a pulsar spin harmonic detected coherently goes as @xmath122 .",
    "this leads to a rule - of - thumb for those conducting sideband searches : `` the longer the observation the better . ''",
    "when making very long observations it is important to keep the on - source time ( i.e. the window function ) as continuous and uniform as possible .",
    "significant gaps in the data  especially periodic or recurring gaps of the kind common in x - ray observations  create side - lobes around fourier peaks of constant - frequency pulsations that a sideband search will detect .",
    "it is a good idea before a sideband search to take the power spectrum of the power spectrum of the known window function in order to identify spurious orbital periods that a sideband search might uncover .",
    "since phase modulation sidebands require coherent pulsations ( i.e. @xmath3 is constant in time ) in order to form , it may be necessary to correct the time series ( or equivalently the fourier transform ) such that the underlying pulsations are coherent .",
    "as an example , if the telescope s motion with respect to the solar system barycenter is not taken into account during long observations , interstellar pulsations  and therefore any phase modulation sidebands as well  will be `` smeared '' across numerous fourier bins due to doppler effects . by stretching or compressing the time series to account for the earth s motion before fourier transforming ( or equivalently , by applying the appropriate fourier domain matched filter _ after _",
    "the fourier transform , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the smeared signal can be made coherent for the purposes of the sideband search .",
    "if the time - dependence of @xmath3 is unknown _ a priori _ , due to accretion in an lmxb , the spin - down of a young pulsar , or timing ( spin ) noise , for example , one could in principle attempt a series of trial corrections and a sideband search for each trial .",
    "such a search methodology is similar in computational complexity to traditional `` acceleration '' searches .    while  [ sec : twostage ] provided basic principles for detecting compact binary pulsars using the two - staged fourier analysis , in the rest of this section we provide a more detailed discussion of how a search might be conducted .",
    "figure  [ fig : recipe ] shows two examples of sideband searches .",
    "the left column shows data from an 8h observation of the globular cluster 47  tucanae taken with the parkes radio telescope at 20 cm on 2000 november 17 .",
    "the signal is the fundamental harmonic of the 2.1ms binary pulsar 47  tuc  j ( @xmath123hz , @xmath124h , @xmath125 , @xmath126radians , and @xmath127_@xmath128 ) with a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath129 .",

    "once a long observation has been obtained and prepared as discussed above , we fourier transform the data and compute the power spectrum @xmath104 .",
    "we then begin a sideband search which is composed of two distinct parts : initial detection of a binary pulsar and the determination of a detected pulsar s orbital elements .      to maximize the signal - to - noise of a detection in @xmath109 , we want to match both the length and location of a short fft @xmath106 with the width and location of a pulsar s sideband response ( @xmath136 ) in @xmath104 .",
    "because a pulsar s orbital parameters are unknown _ a priori _ , we must search a range of short fft lengths @xmath106 and overlap consecutive ffts .",
    "therefore , we must choose the number and lengths of the short ffts , the fraction of each fft to overlap with the next , and the number of harmonics to sum in each fft .",

    "the techniques discussed here could in principle be applied to each set of sidebands from the orbital fourier expansion ( see  [ sec : elliptical ] ) .",
    "such an analysis would be much more complicated than that described here and would require a high signal - to - noise detection .",
    "we have described a new search technique for binary pulsars that can identify sidebands created by orbital modulation of a pulsar signal when @xmath175 .",
    "sideband or phase - modulation searches allow the detection of short orbital period binary pulsars that would be undetectable using conventional search techniques .    figures  [ fig : sim2ms ] and [ fig : sim20ms ] show how the sensitivity of sideband searches compares to that of acceleration searches for a wide range of observation times @xmath0 .",
    "acceleration search sensitivities are near - optimal when @xmath176 @xcite , but degrade rapidly at longer integration times when the constant frequency derivative approximation breaks down . sideband searches , on the other hand , require @xmath177 in order to approach the sensitivity of optimal duration acceleration searches , but for longer @xmath0 sensitivity improves as @xmath120 where @xmath121 . _ for targeted searches of duration @xmath1788@xmath8612h ( e.g. typical globular cluster observations ) , sideband searches are @xmath1782@xmath8610 times more sensitive to compact binary pulsars ( @xmath179h ) than optimal duration acceleration searches . _ in general , one should think of acceleration and sideband searches as complementary to each other  sideband searches allow the detection of ultra - compact binary pulsars , while acceleration searches maximize the detectability of isolated and longer - period binary pulsars .",
    "the fact that sideband searches target a different portion of orbital parameter space than acceleration searches and yet require significantly less computation time , provides good reason to include them in future pulsar searches where @xmath180min .",

    "* ) has included a sideband search in an on - going re - analysis of their survey data at the cost of only a marginal increase in computer time .",
