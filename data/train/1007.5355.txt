    "the so - called `` nucleon spin puzzle '' is still one of the most fundamental problems in hadron physics @xcite,@xcite . in the past few years",
    ", there have been several remarkable progresses from the observational point of view .",
    "first , a lot of experimental evidences have been accumulated , which indicate that the gluon polarization inside the nucleon is likely to be small @xcite-@xcite . at the least",
    ", it seems now widely accepted that the @xmath0-anomaly motivated explanation of the nucleon spin puzzle is disfavored .",
    "second , the quark spin fraction or the net longitudinal quark polarization @xmath1 has been fairly precisely determined through high - statistics measurements of the deuteron spin structure function by compass @xcite,@xcite and the heremes group @xcite . according to these analyses ,",
    "the portion of the nucleon spin coming from the intrinsic quark spin is around 1/3 .",
    "these observations necessarily attract a great deal of interest in the role of orbital angular momenta of quark and gluon field inside the nucleon .    when one talks about the spin contents of the nucleon , however , one can not be unconcerned with the unsettled theoretical issues concerning the decomposition of the nucleon spin .",
    "an especially difficult problem here is the decomposition of the gluon total angular momentum into its intrinsic spin and orbital parts .",
    "most people believe that the polarized gluon distribution function is an observable quantity from high - energy deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) measurements @xcite,@xcite . on the other hand , it is often claimed that there is no gauge - invariant decomposition of the gluon total angular momentum into its spin and orbital parts @xcite,@xcite .",
    "undoubtedly , this latter statement is closely connected with another observation that there is no gauge - invariant local operator corresponding to the 1st moment of the polarized gluon distribution in the standard framework of operator - product expansion .",
    "since , the gauge principle is one of the most important principle of physics , which demands that only gauge - invariant quantities are measurable , how to reconcile these two conflicting observations is a fundamentally important problem in the physics of nucleon spin .    as the first step of the program , which aims at clearing up the state of confusion",
    ", we have recently investigated the relationship between the known decompositions of the nucleon spin @xcite .",
    "we showed that the gauge - invariant decomposition advocated by chen et al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite can be viewed as a nontrivial extension of the gauge - variant decomposition given by jaffe and manohar @xcite , so as to meet the gauge - invariance requirement of each term of the decomposition .",
    "however , we have also pointed out that there is another gauge - invariant decomposition of the nucleon spin , which is closer to the ji decomposition , while allowing the decomposition of the gluon total angular momentum into the spin and orbital parts . after clarifying the reason why the gauge - invariant decomposition of the nucleon spin is not unique",
    ", we emphasized the possible superiority of our decomposition to that of chen et al . on the ground of observability . to be more concrete",
    ", we developed an argument in favor of ji s proposal to obtain a full decomposition of the nucleon spin @xcite .",
    "it supports the widely - accepted experimental project , in which one first determines the total angular momentum of quarks and gluons through generalized - parton - distribution ( gpd ) analyses and then extract the orbital angular momentum contributions of quarks and gluons by subtracting the intrinsic spin parts of quarks and gluons , which can be determined through polarized dis measurements .",
    "unfortunately , our argument lacks a finishing touch in the respect that we did not give a rigorous proof that the quark and gluon intrinsic spin contributions in our gauge - invariant decomposition in fact coincides with the quark and gluon polarizations extracted from the polarized dis analyses .",
    "another question , which is not unrelated to the above problem , is as follows . since our gauge - invariant decomposition as well as that of chen et al .",
    "are given in a specific lorentz frame , we could not give a definite answer to the question whether these decompositions have a frame - independent meaning or not .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to solve these remaining problems .",
    "we will show that these questions can be solved simultaneously , by making full use of a gauge - invariant decomposition of covariant angular - momentum tensor of qcd in an arbitrary lorentz frame .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect.ii",
    ", we show that we can make a gauge - invariant decomposition of the covariant angular - momentum tensor of qcd in an arbitrary lorentz frame , even without fixing gauge explicitly .",
    "next , in sect.iii , the nucleon forward matrix element of the pauli - lubansky vector expressed in terms of the covariant angular - momentum tensor and the nucleon momentum is utilized to obtain a gauge- and frame - independent decomposition of the nucleon spin . in sect.iv , we clarify the relation between our decomposition and the high - energy dis observables .",
    "summary and conclusion of our analyses are then given in sect.v .",
    "following jaffe and manohar @xcite , we start with a belinfante symmetrized expression for qcd energy momentum tensor given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is conserved , @xmath5 , symmetric , @xmath6 , and gauge invariant .",
    "the qcd angular momentum tensor @xmath7 is a rank-3 tensor constructed from @xmath4 as @xmath8 @xmath7 is conserved , @xmath9 , and gauge - invariant , if @xmath4 is symmetric and conserved .",
    "another noteworthy property of @xmath7 , which was emphasized by jaffe and manohar , is that it has no totally antisymmetric part , which means that it satisfies the identity @xmath10 or equivalently @xmath11 as shown in @xcite , by using the identity @xmath12 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quark part of @xmath7 can gauge - invariantly be decomposed in the following way @xmath13 _ up to a surface term_. in remarkable contrast , it is a wide - spread belief that the gluon part of @xmath7 can not be gauge - invariantly decomposed into the intrinsic spin and orbital angular momentum contributions @xcite,@xcite . the gauge - invariant version of the decomposition of @xmath7 given in the paper by jaffe and manohar is therefore given as @xmath14 with @xmath15 \\ - \\    \\frac{1}{2 } \\,\\mbox{tr } \\,f^2 \\ ,   [ \\,x^{\\nu } \\,g^{\\mu \\lambda } \\ - \\ x^{\\lambda } \\,g^{\\mu \\nu } \\ , ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this is essentially the covariant version of the ji decomposition @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the 2nd term of @xmath16 contributes only to lorentz boosts , so that it has nothing to do with nucleon spin decomposition .    somewhat surprisingly , however , basically by following the idea proposal by chen et al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , we can make a gauge - invariant decomposition of @xmath16 , at least formally .",
    "the idea is to decompose the gluon field into two parts as @xmath17 with @xmath18 a pure - gauge term transforming in the same way as the full @xmath19 does , and always giving null field strength , and @xmath20 a physical part of @xmath19 transforming in the same manner as @xmath21 does , i.e. covariantly .",
    "that is , the two important properties of this decomposition is the condition for the pure - gauge part of the field , @xmath22 \\",
    "= \\ 0 ,   \\label{pure - gauge}\\ ] ] and the gauge transformation properties of the two parts : @xmath23 as a matter of course , these conditions are not enough to uniquely fix gauge . to uniquely fix gauge , chen et al .",
    "proposed to impose some additional gauge - fixing condition , which is a generalization of the coulomb gauge condition in the case of qed .",
    "( the detail of the gauge - fixing problem is discussed also in the recent researches @xcite,@xcite . )",
    "alternatively , one can take the light - cone gauge with some appropriate boundary condition for the gauge field . in either case",
    ", these extra gauge - fixing procedure necessarily breaks the lorentz symmetry .",
    "fortunately , we find it possible to accomplish a gauge - invariant decomposition of covariant rank-3 tensor @xmath7 based on the above conditions ( [ pure - gauge ] ) @xmath24 ( [ gtr - pure ] ) only , while postponing a concrete gauge - fixing procedure until the later stage .",
    "the usefulness of such covariant formulation should become apparent if one tries to compare the relation between the nucleon spin decomposition in different gauges and in different lorentz frames .",

    "however , since this operator is generally nonlocal , there is no conflict with the knowledge of the standard operator - product expansion . from a practical viewpoint , more important lesson to be learned from our present theoretical analysis would be the _ physical insight _ into the measurable quark and gluon orbital angular momenta appearing in our recommendable decomposition ( i ) .",
    "we have confirmed that the quark orbital angular momentum , which can be extracted as the difference of the 2nd moment of the unpolarized quark gpd and the 1st moment of the longitudinally polarized quark distribution , is the _ dynamical _ quark orbital angular momentum @xmath283 not the _ canonical _ one @xmath284 .",
    "similarly , the gluon orbital angular momentum extracted as the difference of the 2nd moment of the unpolarized gluon gpd and the 1st moment of the longitudinally polarized gluon distribution is not the _ canonical _ orbital angular momentum but the _ dynamical _ orbital angular momentum containing the _ potential angular momentum _ term in our terminology . even though no experimental process to directly access to the canonical orbital angular momenta is known at present , one should clearly keep in mind the existence of two kinds of orbital angular momenta for both of quarks and gluons .",
