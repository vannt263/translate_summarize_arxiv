    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , is nowadays at the start of a new program which is expected to run for about other 20 years .",
    "it is called high luminosity lhc  @xcite ( hl - lhc ) and it is cern s number - one priority which aims to increase the number of collisions accumulated in the experiments by a factor of ten from 2024 onwards .    while hl - lhc project is already well defined for the next two decades , cern has started an exploratory study for a future long - term project based on a new generation of circular colliders with a circumference of about 100 km .",
    "the future circular collider ( fcc ) study  @xcite has been undertaken to design a high energy proton - proton machine ( fcc - hh ) , capable of reaching unprecedented energies in the region of 100 tev , and a high - luminosity e+e- collider ( fcc - ee ) , serving as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , higgs and top factory , with luminosities ranging from about @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xmath4s@xmath5 per collision point as a potential intermediate step towards the realization of the hadron facility .",
    "the design of the lepton collider complex will be based on the same infrastructure as the hadron collider .    at high beam intensity , necessary to reach the high luminosity foreseen for fcc - ee , the electromagnetic fields , self - generated by the beam interacting with its immediate surroundings and known as wake fields  @xcite ,",
    "act back on the beam , perturbing the external guiding fields and the beam dynamics . under unfavorable conditions ,",
    "the perturbation on the beam further enhances the wake fields ; the beam - surroundings interaction then can lead to a reduction of the machine performances and , in some cases , also to instabilities .",
    "the theory of collective beam instabilities induced by the wake fields is a broad subject and it has been assessed over many years by the work of several authors , such as f.  sacherer  @xcite , a.  w.  chao  @xcite , j.  l.  laclare  @xcite , b.  zotter  @xcite , c.  pellegrini  @xcite , m.  sands  @xcite and others  @xcite .    to simplify the study of collective effects , in general it is convenient to distinguish between short range wake fields , which influence the single bunch beam dynamics , and long range wake fields , where high quality factor resonant modes excited by a train of bunches can last for many turns exciting , under some conditions , coupled bunch instabilities . in both cases the bunch motion is considered as a sum of coherent oscillation modes perturbed by these wake fields .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the fcc - ee collective effects induced by wake fields . in particular we will first evaluate the wake fields induced by the finite resistivity of the beam vacuum chamber ( resistive wall ) in section  [ s : sec1 ] . due to the 100 km of length of the beam pipe , the resistive wall is going to play a fundamental role among the sources of wake fields for this accelerator , and the choice of the pipe geometry ( circular or elliptical ) , material , and dimensions is particularly important . in section  [ s : sec2 ]",
    "we study the collective effects induced by the resistive wall for both the short range ( [ s : sub1 ] ) and long range wake fields ( [ s : sub2 ] ) , and for both longitudinal and transverse planes .",
    "for some instabilities we will resort to the linear theory , while for other cases and for more accurate predictions , we need to use simulation codes .",
    "section  [ s : sec3 ] is then dedicated to other important sources of wake fields , such as the rf system and tapers , and to the discussions on the choice of some devices , as the synchrotron radiation absorbers , in order to reduce their impact on the total wake field .",
    "finally , concluding remarks and outlook will end the paper .    for reference",
    "we report in table  [ tab1 ] the list of beam parameters we have used for evaluating the effects of wake fields on the beam dynamics .",

    "several papers have been written to determine the microwave instability threshold  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the microwave instability due to the resistive wall wake fields was analyzed giving a criterion for the threshold evaluation .",
    "applied to the fcc - ee case , it gives a threshold value of @xmath6 , a factor slightly higher than 2 with respect to the nominal bunch population .",
    "this value can be compared with the results of the tracking code . from fig .",
    "[ energyspread ] , where we represented the rms energy spread given by the code as a function of the bunch population , we can see that the energy spread starts to increase at about @xmath7 .",
    "this is in a good agreement with the above analytical estimate .        as a further check of the tracking code results ,",
    "a vlasov - fokker - planck solver  @xcite has also been used , showing that up to a bunch population of @xmath8 the beam is stable and giving the onset of the instability at about @xmath9 .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ bunchlength ] shows the rms bunch length , obtained with the simulation code , as a function of the bunch population up to an intensity of @xmath10 , a value six times higher than the nominal bunch population .",
    "a more critical situation is related to the transverse coupled bunch instability due to the long range transverse wake fields . in this case",
    "the study can be performed by considering the motion of the entire beam ( not of the single bunch ) as a sum of coherent oscillation modes , with coupled bunch modes to be taken into account . by considering the lowest azimuthal mode @xmath11 and a gaussian bunch , the real part of the coupling impedance can produce stability or instability depending on the sign of the growth rate @xmath12 g_{\\perp } \\left(\\sigma_{\\tau } \\omega'_q \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath13 the total beam current , @xmath14 the betatron tune , @xmath15 the rms bunch length in time , @xmath16 a form factor which , for our case , is about 1 , and @xmath17 with @xmath18 the number of bunches , @xmath19 the chromaticity , and @xmath20 the revolution frequency .    in the above equations , @xmath21 represents the @xmath22 coupled bunch mode , which goes from 0 to @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath24 is positive , the corresponding mode is unstable . if we consider , as transverse impedance , the resistive wall one given by eq .",
    "( [ rw2 ] ) , and ignore the term @xmath25 , we observe that @xmath26 $ ] depends on the sign of the frequency @xmath27 .",
    "negative frequencies produce unstable modes with an exponential growth given by eq .",
    "( [ tcbi ] ) , while positive ones give rise to damped oscillations .",
    "in addition to that , the resistive wall impedance grows approximately with the inverse of the square root of the frequency , determining the most dangerous coupled bunch mode when @xmath28 is as close to zero as possible .",
    "if we consider , as an example , the parameters given by table  [ tab1 ] , and @xmath29 , by denoting with @xmath30 the integer part of the betatron tune , that is @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the fractional part of the tune , which plays a crucial role for this kind of instability , it comes out that the most dangerous coupled bunch mode is @xmath33 , and this mode has its lowest negative frequency at @xmath34 .    fig .",
    "[ tbci1 ] shows the beam spectrum of three coupled bunch modes and the real part of the resistive wall impedance of a circular pipe of aluminium , with radius of 35 mm and three layers , close to zero frequency for two extreme cases of fractional part of the betatron tune , @xmath35 ( left ) and @xmath36 ( right ) , and we see that a smaller fractional tune is preferred to alleviate the transverse coupled bunch instability because the impedance has a lower value . due to dynamic aperture and beam - beam issues , and since fcc - ee has 2 interaction points , the fractional tunes are indeed just above the integer  @xcite , and therefore its fractional part is close to zero , mitigating the instability growth rate .     for fractional tune @xmath35 ( left ) and @xmath36 ( right).,width=623 ]    if we consider , as an approximation , not a sum of the impedance over frequency in eq .",
    "( [ tcbi ] ) , but the coupling with a single betatron frequency line of the coupled bunch modes , the most dangerous unstable mode has a growth rate given approximately by @xmath37 which , for the best case with @xmath35 , gives a growth rate of about 432.4 s@xmath5 , corresponding to a rise time of approximately 2.3 ms , that is about 7 machine turns .",
    "if the fractional tune increases , the situation worsens . in fig .",
    "[ tbci2 ] we show the growth rate as a function of the fractional tune for the worst coupled bunch mode ( left plot ) , and as a function of the coupled bunch mode number for the case with @xmath35 ( right plot ) .",
    "( right).,width=623 ]    a more precise calculation by considering the sum in eq .",
    "( [ tcbi ] ) and by using the laguerre polynomials with the delphi code confirms the values of the growth rates . as we can see from the right plot of fig .",
    "[ tbci2 ] , there are several unstable modes , and all of them need to be damped .",
    "in addition to that , even if the rise times are in the range of few milliseconds , which are not of particular concern for an accelerator machine , due to the large circumference , the rise times correspond to very few turns , making very challenging the realization of a feedback system . some schemes that could deal with this problem have been proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the previous instabilities , for the elliptic vacuum chambers , as we have seen in the previous section , there are quadrupolar resistive wall wake fields that can produce a substantial tune variation with beam current in the multi - bunch regime .",
    "these are particularly important for the lowest energy fcc - ee option ( 45.6 gev ) with the highest beam current ( 1450 ma ) distributed over a large number of circulating bunches .    for a rectangular vacuum chamber",
    "inside dipole magnets , the tune slope is estimated by  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radius of the machine , @xmath40 and @xmath41 the half height and half width of the vacuum chamber , @xmath42 the ring fraction with the rectangular chamber ( dipoles ) .",
    "this equation has reproduced very well the tune shifts observed in the high current lepton factories pep - ii  @xcite and da@xmath43ne  @xcite . for the sake of estimates",
    "we consider the rectangular vacuum chamber with a cross section of 2bx2d= 70 mm x 120 mm and assume that the dipole vacuum chambers occupy @xmath44 of the ring , similarly to the her of pep - ii .",
    "in these conditions , for the energy of 45.6 gev we obtain the tune variation of @xmath45 as a consequence , during the beam injection and up to the nominal value of 1.45 a , the tune variation would be as large as about 0.37 . in order to cope with",
    "such big tune changes additional feedback systems would be necessary to keep the tune constant as required by the beam - beam interaction , dynamic aperture considerations and other beam dynamics issues .    for what concerns possible longitudinal coupled bunch instabilities excited by homs , at this stage",
    "it is not possible to quantify their impedance contribution , but we can estimate the maximum shunt impedance that gives a growth rate that can be compensated by the natural radiation damping .",
    "similarly to the transverse case , starting from the linearized vlasov equation , and developing any perturbation of the beam distribution as sum of coherent oscillation modes , it is possible to obtain an eigenvalue system representing the coherent frequencies of the modes . by neglecting the coupling between the different azimuthal modes , and by considering only the lowest longitudinal azimuthal mode @xmath46 , it is possible to show that the real part of the hom impedance can produce stability or instability depending on the sign of the growth rate @xmath47 g_{|| } \\left(\\sigma_{\\tau } \\omega_q \\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath48 the synchrotron tune and @xmath49 .",
    "stability in this case occurs for negative frequencies because the real part of the longitudinal impedance is always positive , and the worst and simplest unstable case is when the hom has its resonant angular frequency @xmath50 equal to @xmath51 .",
    "similarly to the transverse case , if we consider , as an approximation , not a sum of the impedance over frequency , but the coupling with a single synchrotron frequency line of the coupled bunch modes , the most dangerous unstable mode has a growth rate given approximately by @xmath52 with @xmath53 the hom shunt impedance .",
    "also in this case @xmath54 , if @xmath55 ghz .",
    "this growth rate has to be compared with the natural damping rate due to the synchrotron radiation , which , for the lowest energy machine , is about 1320 turns . in fig .",
    "[ homs ] , we have represented the maximum hom shunt impedance of eq .",
    "( [ eq : growth_long ] ) as a function of the resonance frequency , such that the corresponding growth rate is exactly balanced by the radiation damping .",
    "of course , similarly to the transverse case , also here a feedback system has to be developed as a further safety knob .",
    "in the previous section , by discussing the effects of the resistive wall , we have seen that its contribution on the beam dynamics is very important , requiring , in some cases , active feedback systems to keep under control beam instabilities . due to the above results",
    ", we can consider , as a rough indication to accept the impedance of a given device in the design stage , the comparison of its wake potential with the resistive wall one .",
    "generally , for a high energy e+e- machine , the handling of synchrotron radiation represents one of the most challenging tasks . as a consequence of this ,",
    "it is necessary to have a sufficient number of cavities to recover the lost energy , and , in addition to that , synchrotron radiation absorbers , necessary to cope with extra heating and eventual background .",
    "these devices could be important sources of impedance , and their evaluation is considered in this section and compared with the resistive wall contribution .",
    "let us first estimate the impact of the synchrotron radiation absorbers . for fcc - ee a synchrotron radiation absorber",
    "will be installed every 4 - 6 meters , with the purpose of intercepting the radiation that , otherwise , would impact on the beam chamber . due to their large number ,",
    "the absorbers represent a very important source of machine impedance .",
    "initially , an elliptical vacuum pipe , with absorbers on one side of the major semi - axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ old_absorber ] , was proposed .",
    "a total of 9228 absorbers was estimated  @xcite",
    ".        of course , the contribution of a single absorber could be neglected , but the effect of all of them is expected to be prohibitively large compared to the resistive wall of a circular beam pipe . in fig .",
    "[ wp_old_abs ] we have represented the wake potential of a 4 mm gaussian bunch given by all the absorbers as obtained by cst particle studio  @xcite and by using a simpler and more approximated approach that takes into account a rectangular geometry with two absorbers at each side  @xcite . in the same figure the wake potential of 10000 absorbers given by cst considering a new alternative design described below is also shown .",
    "even if there is a certain degree of uncertainty in the results , and clearly the more approximated approach may overestimate the longitudinal wake potential using two absorbers for symmetry reasons , both approaches demonstrate that the impedance contribution of the absorbers in this condition is unacceptable .",
    "in addition to this result , if we further consider the previous comments on the tune shifts produced by the quadrupolar wake fields of the elliptic vacuum chamber , it is clear that the elliptic cross section is not the best solution for fcc - ee from the impedance point of view .",
    "a proposed alternative is the installation of a circular vacuum chamber , with radius 35  mm and winglets on both sides , as the one of super - kekb  @xcite",
    ". bellows with rf fingers and valves are to be designed with the same profile .",
    "transitions to a circular cross section chamber ( without winglets ) should be necessary only to connect the pipe to the rf system .",
    "the absorbers are metallic devices shaped like a trapezoid , with a total length of 30 cm , and they are inserted inside the chamber winglets , at about 42.5 mm from the beam axis .",
    "placing slots for vacuum pumps just in front of the absorber allows to efficiently capture the synchrotron radiation and the molecule desorption .",
    "the pumping slots have a racetrack profile , length of 100 - 120  mm and width of 4 - 6  mm . behind the slots , a cylindrical volume and a flange",
    "will be installed to support a neg pump  @xcite .",
    "impedance studies of the beam chamber profile with one absorber insertion have been performed using cst . in fig .",
    "[ absorber ] , the geometry of the fcc - ee beam chamber used in cst simulations is shown together with a detail of the absorber inside the beam chamber .",
    "pumping slots and pumps are not included in this preliminary model .",
    "simulations show that below about 3  ghz the longitudinal impedance is purely inductive , giving , for 10000 elements , a longitudinal broadband impedance @xmath56 of about 1  m@xmath57 .        in fig .",
    "[ wpabsorbers ] , the wake potential of a 2 and 4 mm bunch length is shown . even if further analysis is needed , and this first evaluation could overestimate the impedance , by multiplying this wake by the number of absorbers , about 10000 elements , we see that their contribution is much lower than the resistive wall one , as shown in fig .",
    "[ wp_old_abs ] . about the transverse contribution to the impedance of a single absorber ,",
    "this is so low that , up to now , we did not manage to obtain reliable results .",
    "another important source of impedance is represented by the rf system .",
    "several options are under investigation  @xcite , and in our study 400 mhz cavities with a single cell , as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ cavity ] left side , have been considered .",
    "the wake potentials for 2 and 4 mm rms bunch length , as given by the abci code  @xcite , are shown on the right side of the same figure .",
    "( green and black).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   ( green and black).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in order to check the abci results , in the same plot we have also represented the analytical wake potentials , for the same bunch lengths , of a cavity with attached tubes at high frequencies , given by the expression  @xcite @xmath58\\ ] ] with @xmath59 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "as we can see from the figure , the analytical curves are almost superimposed to those given by abci .    by using the single cell , a group of 4 cavities",
    "are put together as shown in fig .",
    "[ rfsystem ] , and connected to other two groups by two tapers .",
    "a total number of 100 cells has been considered as a global contribution to the impedance model , and , as a consequence , 25 double tapers .",
    "of course the impedance produced by the tapers strongly depends on their length , which we have considered here to be of 500 mm .",
    "the wake potential of a single double taper ( in and out , considered independent ) in this condition is shown in fig .",
    "[ tapers ] .",
    "the results have been obtained with abci and another electromagnetic code , echo  @xcite , and the agreement can be considered satisfactory .        since the rf system ( including the connecting tapers ) and",
    "the absorbers are very important sources of impedance , in particular these last ones for their high number , in fig .",
    "[ waketot ] we have represented the total longitudinal wake potential of these sources for 2 and 4 mm bunch length compared with the resistive wall contribution . in the figure the red and the blue curves have to be compared with the green and the black one respectively .",
    "we can see a factor of about 3 between the resistive wall contribution and the other sources , indicating that , up to now , the resistive wall remains the main source of impedance and wake fields .",
    "of course , also the transverse contribution of the previous devices has to be taken into account .",
    "however , since their longitudinal contribution is quite smaller than the resistive wall , even if a more careful evaluation has to be carried out , we do not expect surprising results .",
    "there are several other sources of impedance , such as bellows , rf fingers , bpms and other devices for diagnostics , and the criterion for their design should be such as to generate an impedance much smaller with respect to the resistive wall part .",
    "possible trapped modes in the interaction region deserve special studies , and work on other collective effects , such as the fast ion and the electron cloud instabilities , is in progress .",
    "in this paper we have discussed single beam collective effects in fcc - ee due to the beam coupling impedance . in particular",
    "we focused our study primarily on the resistive wall effects because this is , up to now , the main source of impedance .",
    "we have found that , in the single bunch case , the transverse mode coupling instability is about a factor 6 higher than the nominal bunch population at the lowest energy ( 45.6 gev ) , and even higher for the other machine energies .",
    "also the microwave instability due to the resistive wall has a margin of safety of about 2.4 with respect to the bunch population .",
    "however these numbers will be reduced as other sources of impedance will be taken into account .    regarding the multi - bunch effect ,",
    "we have concluded that the resistive wall transverse coupled bunch instability has to be counteracted by a feedback system , which requires innovative ideas for its design .",
    "also the quadrupolar resistive wall wake fields , due to the elliptic vacuum chamber , produce a very high tune variation , which would not exist for the circular geometry .",
    "for the longitudinal case , at this stage , it is not possible to evaluate the characteristics of trapped homs , but an estimate of the maximum allowed shunt impedance as a function of the resonant frequency has been given .",
    "in addition to the assessment of the resistive wall effects , we have started the evaluation of the impedance budget for other devices , with the goal of designing them in order to give an impact on the beam dynamics much smaller than that of the resistive wall itself . with an accelerator of 100 km of length , this is a long work , and the strategy is to identify the most important sources of impedance . we have started with the synchrotron radiation absorbers and the rf system . for the former , it resulted that the initial proposal could not be accepted , and , consequently , a new geometry of the beam pipe has been presented . both contributions together amount to about one third of the resistive wall one in the longitudinal plane .",
    "their evaluation in the transverse plane is in progress .",
    "other machine devices are going to be studied with the goal of comparing their contribution to the resistive wall impedance .",
    "also two - stream instabilities , such as the fast ion and the electron cloud , must be determined .",
