    "two of the most remarkable experimental discoveries at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) are the observations of a factor five quenching of ( high transverse momentum or high quark mass ) jets and the nearly `` perfect fluid '' elliptic flow of low transverse momentum hadrons @xcite .",
    "these observations and bulk multiplicity production systematics have been interpreted as providing evidence for the formation of two new forms of qcd matter 1 ) a locally equilibrated strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) and 2 ) its non - abelian classical color glass condensate ( cgc ) initial nuclear field source @xcite .    however , it has been a challenge to find a single consistent theoretical framework to explain simultaneously both soft ( long wavelength ) and hard ( short wavelength ) properties of the sqgp phenomena . attempts to explain bulk collective flow @xcite based on perturbative qcd parton transport approaches @xcite , require large coupling extrapolations @xmath6 , which on the other hand overestimate of the opacity of the sqgp to high transverse momentum jets . at moderate coupling @xmath7",
    "the observed opacity for light quark jets can be well accounted for but at the expense of too high viscosity and underestimating the elliptic flow .",
    "the heavy quark jet quenching data pose an especially difficult challenge for perturbative qcd energy loss models @xcite .    for large values of the qcd coupling , the thooft parameter @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 )",
    "may already be large enough to validate string theory inspired classical ads / cft holographic models @xcite of the sqgp . in this approximation , the viscosity to entropy ratio is naturally small @xcite and close to its lower unitarity bound @xcite .",
    "classical strings in the ads background furthermore provide a dual holographic model of heavy quark drag with @xmath10 that can easily account for the high opacity of the sqgp to heavy quark jets @xcite .",
    "the key question that we address in this paper is whether there exists a single value of @xmath11 that could account for both the bulk elliptic flow as well as the strong heavy quark quenching simultaneously .",
    "we test at the same time the consistency of the cgc initial field source geometry out of which the sqgp forms .",
    "our conclusion is that conformal holography can indeed account for the observed hard / soft correlation data with the cgc initial geometry with @xmath12 while classical glauber initial geometry is not consistent within present experimental errors .",
    "we emphasize the importance of testing future identified charm and bottom jet quenching data systematics and their correlation with soft bulk flow observables .",
    "the planar limit of strongly - coupled @xmath13 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory provides a powerful phenomenological model of the sqgp at zero baryonic chemical potential in the temperature range where the trace anomaly is small .",
    "soft collective flow phenomena are controlled by the system s entropy density , @xmath14 , and shear viscosity , @xmath15 . in this conformal @xmath16 theory ,",
    "the bulk viscosity vanishes and the dimensionless ratio @xmath17 is independent of temperature . while conformal invariance is broken in real world qcd , the conformal symmetry of @xmath13 sym played an important role in the conjectured classical supergravity dual description @xcite of this cft on a ads@xmath18 curved spacetime . in the @xmath19 limits , the compactification of a 10d type iib string theory on a 5d sphere of radius @xmath20 leads to a 5d einstein action with a negative cosmological constant @xmath21 the effective 5d gravitational coupling is taken as @xmath22 , and the @xmath23 metric @xmath24 is found to be a stationary solution with curvature @xmath25 . the thooft coupling in the gauge theory is identified with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the fundamental 10d string length .",

    "breaking of supersymmetry on the gauge theory side can lead in the gravity dual description to lower order quadratic or cubic curvature corrections .",
    "a class of gauss - bonnet generalizations of the effective 5d einstein action was considered in @xcite .",

    "we find below that rhic hard / soft correlation observables are in fact compatible with @xmath44 .",
    "conformal holography refers to the predicted temperature independence of @xmath45 , the entropy density of a very strongly coupled sym compared to its ideal stefan boltzmann limit , and also of the viscosity to entropy density ratio .",
    "the heavy quark jet relaxation rate , @xmath46 , is controlled by @xmath47 for a heavy quark with mass @xmath48 in a plasma of temperature @xmath49 @xcite . the relaxation time is related to the heavy quark energy loss per unit length through @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "the hard observable we consider here is heavy quark energy loss .",

    "this is not the case for observables such as the string drag or the effective heavy quark potential @xcite .",
    "there are no known reasons to exclude terms in the @xmath28 expansion of the 2d world sheet theory .",
    "physically , these corrections correspond to fluctuations of the string worldsheet around its minimum area .",
    "for instance , the @xmath28 corrections just from the worldsheet string loops defined on top of a supergravity background ( where the gravity dual s action contain only quadratic terms in the spacetime derivatives ) would contribute to the energy loss @xmath108 of a heavy quark in the medium as follows @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a dimensionless quantity , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 with @xmath113 denote the contribution from @xmath114 string loop corrections .",

    "note that with this type of correction suggests that the magnitude of the energy loss becomes larger than the value obtained at infinite coupling as @xmath11 decreases ( or @xmath17 increases ) , which is certainly counterintuitive and most likely unphysical .",

    "( [ loopexpansion ] ) are included the correct physical behavior ( i.e. , smaller coupling means smaller energy loss ) is recovered .",

    "the holographic string drag model postulated for heavy quarks is inapplicable for light quark jets and may break down already for charm quark jets .",
