    "the interaction potential between vortices has been an important study subject for many years . in 1971 , kramer @xcite used the asymptotic behavior of the vortex fields for large distances in the abelian higgs model to obtain an analytical expression for the vortex - vortex interaction potential , which is given by modified bessel functions . this potential is attractive ( repulsive ) for type - i ( type - ii ) systems , i.e. , for a superconductor ginzburg - landau parameter with @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , where @xmath2 is the penetration depth and @xmath3 is the coherence length .",
    "moreover , this expression leads to a constant interaction energy as a function of the separation between vortices for the critical value @xmath4 ( also called the bogomolnyi point ) , implying that vortices do not interact in this regime .",
    "a detailed analysis of the vortex - vortex ( v - v ) interaction was given later by jacobs and rebbi , @xcite who constructed a variational function describing two separate vortices and obtained the variational parameters by minimizing the free energy .",
    "this variational function was able to model : i ) the deformation of the vortex core when the vortices are brought close to each other , and ii ) the formation of a giant vortex @xcite when vortices are superimposed on each other .",
    "thereafter , several works studied different aspects of the interaction between vortices in superconductors .",
    "for example , brandt @xcite used the asymptotic expression for the interaction potential to study the elastic properties of flux - line lattices in type - ii superconductors .",
    "speight @xcite derived the v - v interaction from a linear field theory described by a lagrangian of two singular point sources placed at the vortex centers .",
    "@xcite used the linear field theory proposed by speight to obtain the interaction between separated strings in a model with two order parameters , which may be relevant for superconducting cosmic strings , @xcite the so(5 ) model of high - temperature superconductivity and solitons in nonlinear optics . eventually , all these analytical approximations lead to expressions which are the same , or at least very similar , to the one derived by kramer for large separation between vortices .",
    "other models were presented by mohamed _",
    "@xcite , who used a perturbative approach to calculate the v - v interaction for superconductors with @xmath5 when the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory is extended to low temperatures , and by hernndez and lpez , @xcite who used a variational approach based on the clem trial function @xcite to calculate the force between vortices .",
    "@xcite showed recently that for non - abelian vortex interactions , there are two other regimes besides the well - known type - i and type - ii : depending on the relative orientation , the interaction potential can show attractive and repulsive regions for the same system .",
    "similar behavior can be achieved in a two - band superconductor .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we solve numerically the set of ginzburg - landau ( gl ) differential equations for two vortices fixed at a certain distance from each other .",
    "we are able to recover the v - v potential obtained by jacobs and rebbi @xcite and the asymptotic behaviors predicted by kramer @xcite .",
    "the results are generalized to the case of vortex - giant vortex ( v - gv ) and vortex - antivortex ( v - av ) interactions .",
    "we parameterize all obtained forces for future use in e. g. molecular dynamics simulations of the vortex matter .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we review the asymptotic behavior of the magnetic field and order parameter of the single static vortex in the gl theory and expand the analytical expression suggested by kramer to study the interaction between a single vortex and another vortex , an anti vortex or a giant vortex , in the limit of large separation between them . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the set of coupled non - linear differential equations that describe these interactions , which are valid for arbitrary separation between vortices , and thus , also for small distances where deformations of the interacting vortex cores are important .",
    "this set of equations is solved numerically without any approximations for arbitrary values of @xmath6 , and the results for the v - v , v - gv and v - av interactions are shown in sec .",
    "iv and compared to the analytical expressions obtained in sec .",
    "ii . for each of these cases , a fitting function for the interaction",
    "is proposed and the fitting parameters are given .",
    "our results are summarized in sec .",

    "the same expression for @xmath66 was found by kramer by a perturbational approach @xcite and can also be obtained by considering point sources in a linearized field theory @xcite .",
    "it can be easily seen that the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eint ] ) is consistent with the fact that for @xmath17 ( @xmath67 ) , the v - v interaction is attractive ( repulsive ) for large separation , leading to a type - i ( type - ii ) superconducting behavior .",
    "this statement is also valid for vortex - giant vortex interactions , as eq .",
    "( [ eint ] ) still holds for this case , where the interaction potential is obtained just by setting @xmath68 and @xmath69 and finding the fitting coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 for this case .",
    "however , for a v - av interaction , @xmath70 is always negative , leading to an _ attractive _ potential @xmath66 for _ any value _ of @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , eq . ( [ eint ] ) shows that the interaction between an antivortex and a giant vortex is always attractive as well .",
    "this can be understood through a heuristic argument : when a vortex and an antivortex are far from each other , the energy of the system is non - zero , as it is the sum of the energies of one vortex and one antivortex ; on the other hand , when they approach each other they should annihilate , giving _ zero energy_. hence , at least at some distance , the energy of the v - av pair must decrease as @xmath57 approaches zero and , as a result , the interaction potential is attractive .",
    "this result is in contradiction with ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was claimed that in type - i superconductors the interaction of a v - av pair is repulsive , and which was used to explain the existence of a stable v - av molecule in mesoscopic superconducting triangles @xcite .",

    "( [ eint ] ) shows that the interaction potential for v - av in the critical coupling regime is @xmath79 , which is still attractive since @xmath80 .",
    "hence , unlike vortex - vortex pairs , a v - av pair exhibits an attractive interaction even in the critical case of @xmath65 .",
    "it should be mentioned that , as @xmath81 for @xmath82 , the interaction potential given by eq .",
    "( [ eint ] ) may diverge at small distances for some values of @xmath83 .",
    "this signals the breakdown of this analytical expression for small @xmath57 .",
    "actually , for small separation @xmath57 , the superposition ansatz proposed by bettencourt and rivers and used in the present section also fails , since it does not take into account either the spatial deformation of the fields , or the possibility of the formation of giant vortices .",
    "@xcite hence , the analytical expression for the interaction potential between vortices has a validity restricted to large @xmath57 .",
    "nevertheless , when the interaction potential is calculated by numerical means , taking into account all the features mentioned above , the result shows very good agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eint ] ) for @xmath57 larger than a critical separation @xmath84 which depends on @xmath83 , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "the interaction force @xmath85 can be obtained by taking the derivative of the energies with respect to the distance between the two vortices .",

    "having fixed the positions and vorticities , they just needed to find @xmath92 and @xmath27 that minimize @xmath25 .",
    "as before , instead of deriving euler - lagrange ( differential ) equations , they used a variational procedure , considering trial functions that account for the deformation of the vortices towards the formation of the giant vortex .",
    "the results of jacobs and rebbi are rather accurate and the advantage of their approach is that many terms of the variational function can be integrated analytically .",
    "however , the variational procedure involves many parameters , it is a very long analytical calculation and their trial function is not the most general function : if one wants to solve the problem for a v - av or a v - gv pair , the trial function has to be modified and consequently also the analytical integrals in the variational procedure .    in order to obtain the inter - vortex potential , our approach starts from the ansatz for two vortices @xmath93 , where we control the vorticity @xmath94 and @xmath95 of each vortex .",

    "we presented a theoretical study of the interaction between vortices in bulk superconductors within the ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "an analytical study of the asymptotic behavior of the vortex - vortex interaction shows that a combination of first order modified bessel functions of the second kind describes the behavior of the numerically obtained forces for large vortex - vortex separation . at small distances ,",
    "the fitting curves for v - v and v - gv interactions show that the force in this region behaves as a power function of the separation between vortices .",
    "we proposed a fitting function that combines both limiting behaviors , namely , the power law for small distances and the modified bessel function behavior for large distances .",
    "this function , given by eq .",
    "( [ compfit ] ) , gives fairly accurate fitting of the interaction force for any value of @xmath83 , even in the type - i regime .",
    "it depends on four fitting parameters , which can be obtained for any value of @xmath83 either by interpolating our data presented in table i ( table iii ) , for vortex - vortex ( vortex - giant vortex ) interactions , or by using eqs .",
    "( [ eqpar ] a - d ) with the parameters presented in table ii ( table iv ) .",
    "our analytical study of the v - av interaction shows that the v - av interaction force is attractive for any value of the gl parameter @xmath83 , which is confirmed by our numerical results and contradicts the conjecture proposed in previous works @xcite which implies that the v - av interaction force is repulsive for @xmath17 ( type - i ) . for large v - av separation @xmath57",
    ", the interaction force decays with @xmath57 as a combination of modified bessel functions .",
    "however , for @xmath57 smaller than a critical separation @xmath159 , the conventional v - av pair is no longer the lowest energy state .",
    "instead , the lowest energy state exhibits a strong suppression of the super - current and amplitude of the order parameter in the region between the vortex and antivortex , which results in a different behavior of the force as a function of @xmath57 in this case and , as a consequence , the v - av interaction force is discontinuous at @xmath159 .",
    "furthermore , the conventional v - av pair becomes unstable for @xmath57 lower than the separation @xmath173 , which is interpreted as the v - av annihilation point .",
    "we fitted the interaction force for v - av separations @xmath174 by eq .",
    "( [ fdeltas ] ) and proposed an approximate analytical expression for the v - av interaction force at these separations , given by eq .",
    "( [ vavfinal ] ) , which is valid for any value of @xmath83 .    the fitting functions for the v - v",
    ", v - gv and v - av force given in this work will be useful , for instance , for the study of bulk and mesoscopic systems consisting of many vortices using molecular dynamics techniques .",
    "we nevertheless remark that , although deformations are taken into account in the interaction force between two vortices in this work , the deformations in a many vortices system are expected to be more complex . hence , the molecular dynamics study of many vortices , even with the improved expressions for the interaction force provided in this paper , is still an approximate description of the system . as a method",
    ", the derivation and handling of the differential equations describing the interaction between vortices presented in this work can be further adapted to describe such interactions in e. g. two - band superconductors , or hybrid systems comprising different superconducting materials .",

    "<S> the vortex - vortex interaction potential in bulk superconductors is calculated within the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory and is obtained from a numerical solution of a set of two coupled non - linear gl differential equations for the vector potential and the superconducting order parameter , where the merger of vortices into a giant vortex is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> further , the interaction potentials between a vortex and a giant vortex and between a vortex and an antivortex are obtained for both type - i and type - ii superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results agree asymptotically with the analytical expressions for large inter - vortex separations which are available in the literature . </S>",
