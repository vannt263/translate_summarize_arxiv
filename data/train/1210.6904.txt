    "black hole thermodynamics has a variety of applications , from the insights of quantum gravity gedankenexperiments to practical calculations in heavy ion collisions and condensed matter physics . and there are just as many formalisms for describing the thermodynamic behavior : the classical four laws of black hole mechanics , quantum fields on curved backgrounds , microstate counting by virtue of the cardy formula , and the euclidean path integral formulation , to name a few .",
    "each approach has its benefits , but the path integral approach has proven especially useful for practical calculations at 0- and 1-loop level , particularly in the context of gauge / gravity dualities .",
    "this is due , in part , to its direct connection with the classical formulation of the gravitational theory . given an action @xmath0 for the theory , every relevant field configuration contributes with weight @xmath1 .",
    "of course , the identification and enumeration of the ` relevant field configurations ' may present a challenge .",
    "already in the early days of path integrals it was discovered that the most relevant class of paths behave like the ` weierstrass monster ' : they are continuous but not differentiable at any point . in a simple system , like a point particle in certain potentials ,",
    "the contributions from these paths can be accounted for .",
    "but the prospect of summing contributions from non - differentiable field configurations seems overwhelming for a theory as complex as gravity .",
    "instead , calculations that employ the gravitational path integral will often focus exclusively on the contributions from geometries that satisfy some smoothness conditions .",
    "this assumption may be justified by physically reasonable results , but the fact remains that smooth metrics account for only a fraction of the support of the path integral measure .",
    "the alternative is to require only continuity of the metric when performing path integral calculations , while relaxing the requirement of differentiability .    in this paper",
    "we make some modest progress in this direction by including metrics with conical singularities in the euclidean path integral for a number of gravitational theories .",
    "specifically , we consider the euclidean partition function for a canonical ensemble defined inside a finite cavity .",
    "field configurations in the ensemble satisfy certain boundary conditions at the wall of the cavity , where the system is coupled to an external thermal reservoir . in some cases ( theories with asymptotically anti - de sitter boundary conditions , for instance )",
    "the walls of the box can be removed to an asymptotic region without compromising the existence of the ensemble , but this is not always possible . usually one computes the partition function for this ensemble by summing contributions from metrics that are regular everywhere .",
    "we will relax this condition and include certain configurations with a conical singularity .",
    "this ensemble could be referred to as the _ conical ensemble _ , to distinguish it from the usual canonical ensemble .",
    "we then pose the following questions :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ how do configurations with conical singularities contribute to the partition function ?",
    "can the ground state of the ensemble have a conical singularity ? _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    these questions can be answered quite generally for two - dimensional dilaton gravity .",
    "this class of models includes the spherically symmetric reduction of higher - dimensional theories that admit schwarzschild , schwarzschild - ads , reissner - nordstrm , and btz black holes as solutions , as well as target space actions associated with certain string theory black holes .",
    "how are conical singularities incorporated into the ensemble ? in the semiclassical approximation the partition function is dominated by solutions of the classical equations of motion , with sub - leading contributions coming from smooth fluctuations of the fields around these configurations .",
    "we now wish to take into account geometries that are regular everywhere except for a single point .",
    "the dominant contributions would seem to come from configurations that `` almost '' extremize the action : they satisfy the equations of motion everywhere except for the singular point , similar to the ` off - shell black holes ' considered by carlip and teitelboim @xcite .",
    "the assumptions of our framework then require this point to sit either at the center of the cavity , or the horizon of a black hole .",
    "from the point of view of a higher dimensional model , a conical singularity at any other point other than the center of the cavity would not be consistent with the spherically symmetric reduction of the action . in the context of the two - dimensional dilaton gravity ,",
    "the fact that the configurations satisfy the equations of motion everywhere except a single point implies the existence of a certain killing vector that forces the singularity to sit at the center of the cavity .",
    "thus , the dominant contributions to the partition function from configurations with a conical singularity correspond to solutions of the equations of motion that break down at the horizon , where there is a delta - function singularity in the curvature .    in the canonical ensemble",
    ", one finds that the stable ground state of the system is typically either ` hot empty space ' , a regular black hole , or some superposition of the two , depending on the boundary conditions . even when it is not the ground state a black hole may exist for certain boundary conditions as a local minimum of the free energy , stable against small thermodynamic fluctuations .",
    "we find that the inclusion of conical singularities in the ensemble does not change either of these statements .",
    "when the boundary conditions allow a thermodynamically stable black hole in the canonical ensemble , the addition of a small conical defect  a conical singularity with deficit or surplus angle @xmath2  may result in a lower internal energy or a higher density of states . in other words , small conical defects may be energetically or entropically favored over their smooth counterparts in the conical ensemble .",
    "@xmath3 these results are somewhat surprising because they seem to contradict our intuition that smooth black holes should be the most stable configurations . however , and are not possible simultaneously , and in fact the presence of a small conical defect always increases the free energy : @xmath4 we conclude that black holes that are stable against gaussian fluctuations in the canonical ensemble are also stable against the nucleation of a small conical defect .",
    "this perturbative stability generalizes to a non - perturbative statement about the ground state of the system . with a few caveats",
    ", it appears that the ground state of the conical ensemble is always a smooth field configuration .",
    "in fact , the relationship between the ground state and the boundary conditions is the same as in the canonical ensemble .",
    "we provide general arguments as well as several examples demonstrating these features .    in the semiclassical approximation",
    "the partition function is dominated by the ground state of the system , which is a smooth geometry .",
    "corrections to this leading behavior from small , smooth fluctuations around the ground state are well - understood and can be evaluated using a variety of techniques . since configurations with a conical singularity",
    "do not dominate the partition function , it is natural to ask how their contributions compare to the corrections from smooth fluctuations .",
    "the action is generally a complicated function of the fields , so contributions from conical singularities can not be evaluated analytically except in special cases . however , it is possible to evaluate the contributions numerically , and in the semiclassical limit the results are approximated to high precision by relatively simple functions of the boundary conditions that define the ensemble .",
    "when the ground state is a black hole , we find that the contributions to the partition function from configurations with a conical singularity are comparable to the contributions from gaussian fluctuations .",
    "this suggests that , even in the semiclassical approximation , non - smooth field configurations make important sub - leading contributions to thermodynamic quantities .",
    "it is important to point out that we view these contributions as logically distinct from the `` mass fluctuations '' that are already studied in the literature , see e.g.  @xcite , or from 1-loop quantum corrections derived by taking into account conical defects @xcite .",
    "indeed , the reader may wonder whether the configurations we consider are not already included in those calculations . in the canonical ensemble",
    "the proper temperature is held fixed at the wall of the cavity , and hence black holes with a regular horizon are only present in the ensemble for isolated values of the mass ( if they are present at all ) .",
    "shifting the black hole mass away from these values necessarily introduces a conical singularity at the horizon , and this must be addressed before the role of these configurations in the ensemble can be understood .",
    "thus , we assume that `` mass fluctuations '' in previous calculations like @xcite refer only to small , smooth fluctuations of the fields around a black hole background with a fixed horizon , as opposed to an actual variation in the mass of the black hole .",
    "on the other hand , 1-loop corrections depend explicitly on the precise matter content coupled to the gravitational theory , so they are not exclusively an intrinsic property of the black hole .",
    "see for instance @xcite , eqs .",
    "( 1.1 ) , ( 1.2 ) , and refs .  therein .",
    "thus , our approach of considering non - smooth geometric configurations that are on - shell everywhere except at the horizon is logically distinct form these two approaches . nevertheless , as we will show",
    ", the leading corrections to quantities like the entropy take essentially the same form as they do in other approaches .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:1 ]",
    "we recall some basic results of two - dimensional dilaton gravity and black hole thermodynamics in the canonical ensemble . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we study black holes with a conical defect and evaluate the conical ensemble partition function in the semiclassical approximation . in section [ sec:2a ]",
    "we address general features of thermodynamical observables , discuss stability issues , and give approximate expressions for the contributions to the partition function . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we provide several explicit examples , and in section [ sec:4 ] we point to applications and open problems .    before proceeding we point out a few important conventions , which are the same as @xcite in most cases .",
    "euclidean signature is employed throughout .",
    "nevertheless , terms appropriate to lorentzian signature such as ` minkowski ' and ` horizon ' are used when the meaning is clear .",
    "we use natural units with @xmath5 , and the dimensionless newton s constant in two dimensions is set to @xmath6 .",
    "these constants are restored in certain expressions , when necessary .",
    "in this section we recapitulate some of the main results of @xcite . a reader familiar with these results and",
    "the notation may skip this section .",
    "in this paper we study black hole ( bh ) thermodynamics in two - dimensional models of dilaton gravity .",
    "dilaton gravity in two dimensions is conventionally described by the euclidean action @xmath7 = & \\,\\ , - \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{{\\mathcal{m } } } { \\negthickspace}{\\negthickspace}{\\mathrm{d}}^{\\,2}x \\,\\sqrt{g}\\ , \\left ( \\,x\\,r - u(x)\\,\\left(\\nabla x\\right)^2 - 2 \\ , v(x ) \\ , \\right ) \\\\ \\nonumber & \\,\\ , - \\int_{{\\partial { \\mathcal{m } } } } { { \\negthickspace}{\\negthickspace}{\\negthickspace}}{\\mathrm{d}}x \\,\\sqrt{\\gamma } \\ , x\\,k   + \\int_{{\\partial { \\mathcal{m } } } } { { \\negthickspace}{\\negthickspace}{\\negthickspace}}{\\mathrm{d}}x \\,\\sqrt{\\gamma } \\ , \\sqrt{w(x)e^{-q(x ) } } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dilaton @xmath8 is defined in terms of its coupling to the ricci scalar , which takes the form @xmath9 .",
    "different models are distinguished by the kinetic and potential functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite for reviews .",
    "the bulk terms in the first line of are supplemented by boundary terms in the second line .",
    "the first boundary term is the analog of the gibbons - hawking - york surface integral @xcite , where @xmath12 is the induced metric on the boundary and @xmath13 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature . including this term in the action ensures a dirichlet boundary problem .",
    "the second boundary term is the holographic counterterm derived in @xcite .",
    "it ensures a well - defined variational principle , so that the first variation of the action vanishes on solutions of the equations of motion for all variations that preserve the boundary conditions and @xmath14 appearing in the counterterm is the supergravity pre - potential @xcite . ] .",
    "the functions @xmath15 and @xmath14 , which depend on @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are defined below .",
    "the equations of motion are obtained by extremizing the action with respect to small variations of the fields that preserve the boundary conditions .",
    "this yields @xmath16 solutions of these equations always possess at least one killing vector @xmath17 with orbits that are curves of constant @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "fixing the gauge so that the metric is diagonal , the solutions take the form @xmath18 with @xmath19 the solutions depend on an integration constant @xmath20 , as well as two model - dependent functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 that are given by integrals of @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath21 the integrals are evaluated at @xmath8 , with constants of integration @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "notice that @xmath23 and @xmath20 contribute to @xmath24 in the same manner ; together they represent a single parameter that has been partially incorporated into the definition of @xmath15 . by definition",
    "they transform as @xmath25 and @xmath26 under the shift @xmath27 .",
    "this ensures that the functions and transform homogeneously , allowing @xmath22 to be absorbed into a rescaling of the coordinates but not on @xmath22 . ] .",
    "therefore , the solution depends on a single constant @xmath28 . with an appropriate choice of @xmath23 we can restrict @xmath20 to take values in the range @xmath29 for physical solutions . as evident from the norm of the killing vector @xmath17 is @xmath30 .",
    "if it vanishes we encounter a killing horizon .",
    "solutions with @xmath31 , which exhibit horizons , will be referred to as bhs .",
    "if the function @xmath11 happens to have a zero at @xmath32 then there is a second , inequivalent family of solutions that also have the form .",
    "the dilaton and metric for these solutions are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are arbitrary constants .",
    "in most applications these solutions , which are characterized by a constant dilaton and ricci scalar , are not relevant .",
    "we will generally ignore them , so references to `` generic solutions '' or `` all solutions '' should be understood to mean the solutions and , parametrized by the mass @xmath20 .      in the models we consider , solutions have a non - negative metric function @xmath24 over a semi - infinite interval @xmath36 with the lower end of this interval corresponding to either the origin or a horizon , and the upper end corresponding to the asymptotic region of the space - time .",
    "at the upper end of the interval the function @xmath15 generally diverges @xmath37 so the asymptotic behavior of the metric is characterized by the solution with @xmath38 .",
    "if the metric function is strictly positive then the lower end of the interval is just the value of the dilaton at the origin .",
    "but if @xmath24 vanishes for some value of the dilaton , @xmath39 , then the lower bound is a killing horizon . assuming that the function @xmath40 is non - zero for finite values of @xmath8 , the location of the horizon is related to the parameter @xmath20 by @xmath41 if this condition admits multiple solutions then @xmath42 is always taken to be the outermost horizon , so that @xmath43 for @xmath44 .    for a field configuration to extremize the action it should satisfy the equations of motion at all points , and this imposes certain differentiability conditions on solutions .",
    "in particular , for solutions with @xmath45 the horizon must be a regular point of the geometry .",
    "this fixes the periodicity @xmath46 of the euclidean time , which is given by @xcite @xmath47 the inverse periodicity is related to the surface gravity of the bh by @xmath48 . in an asymptotically flat space - time @xmath49 is also the temperature measured by an observer at infinity , so we denote this quantity by @xmath50 @xmath51 this slight abuse of notation should not be confused with the proper local temperature @xmath52 , which is related to @xmath49 by a dilaton - dependent ` tolman factor'@xcite @xmath53 the proper temperature at infinity coincides with only if @xmath54 as @xmath55 .    a solution with @xmath38 has no horizon , and is therefore regular everywhere without having to place any conditions on the period of the euclidean time .",
    "however , as we will see below , the boundary conditions of the canonical ensemble determine a unique , non - zero value for the otherwise arbitrary period .",
    "we will therefore refer to this solution , which does not contain a black hole but has a non - zero temperature , as ` hot empty space ' ( he s ) .      to describe a consistent bh thermodynamics",
    "we must specify an ensemble and construct the appropriate partition function .",
    "motivated by york s path integral formulation of the canonical ensemble @xcite , we introduce an upper bound @xmath56 on the interval .",
    "this constrains the dilaton to a ` cavity ' @xmath57 whose wall is the dilaton isosurface @xmath58 .",
    "quantities evaluated at the wall or with an explicit dependence on @xmath56 will carry a subscript ` @xmath59 ' .",
    "boundary conditions for the canonical ensemble are imposed by coupling the system to a thermal reservoir , which fixes a dilaton charge @xmath60 and the proper local temperature @xmath61 at the wall of the cavity , one can construct a current that yields that function as its conserved charge . for simplicity ,",
    "we take the dilaton charge at the wall to be @xmath62 , and refer to this boundary condition henceforth as fixing @xmath56 .",
    "a detailed discussion can be found in @xcite , or in section 3.1 of @xcite . ] .",
    "it is convenient to think of the boundary condition on the temperature as fixing the proper local period of the euclidean time , which is just the inverse @xmath63 of the proper local temperature .",
    "the proper local period is related to the period @xmath46 by @xmath64 when combined with the smoothness condition this becomes @xmath65 this model - dependent ( and often complicated ) equation , which may or may not have solutions @xmath66 , determines whether there are smooth black holes in the ensemble for given boundary conditions @xmath67 and @xmath56 .",
    "not all solutions of this equation are relevant : the upper bound on the dilaton implies that only solutions with @xmath68 ` fit ' inside the cavity .",
    "thus , any solutions @xmath20 of that lie in the range @xmath69 are elements of the canonical ensemble , where @xmath70 corresponds to a black hole with horizon located at the wall of the cavity .",
    "one solution that almost always appears in the canonical ensemble is he s ( @xmath38 ) with period fixed by the boundary condition @xmath71 in most models the he s solution dominates the ensemble for at least some range of boundary conditions @xcite .    with these boundary conditions",
    "the partition function of the canonical ensemble is given by the euclidean path integral @xmath72 \\right ) ~.\\ ] ] for now we will take the path integral to include all smooth spaces @xmath73 and dilaton configurations @xmath8 that satisfy the boundary conditions , but we will relax the smoothness requirement in the next section . in the semi - classical limit the dominant contribution to",
    "the euclidean path integral comes from the minimum of the action .",
    "the minimum is of course a stationary point of the action  either a black hole with @xmath31 satisfying ( if such a solution exists ) , or he s with period .",
    "so the action for smooth field configurations near the minimum can be written as @xmath74 = & \\,\\ , { \\gamma}[g_{\\textrm{\\tiny min}},x_{\\textrm{\\tiny min } } ] + { \\delta}{\\gamma}[g_{\\textrm{\\tiny min } } , x_{\\textrm{\\tiny min } } ; \\delta g , \\delta x ] \\\\",
    "\\nonumber    & \\,\\ , + \\frac12 \\,{\\delta}^2{\\gamma}[g_{\\textrm{\\tiny min } } , x_{\\textrm{\\tiny min } } ; \\delta g , \\delta x ] + \\ldots   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the linear and quadratic terms in the taylor expansion .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the leading term is finite and the linear term vanishes for all field variations @xmath77 , @xmath78 consistent with the boundary conditions .",
    "since the solution is assumed to be a minimum ( as opposed to a saddle point ) the quadratic term is positive definite and the semi - classical approximation of the path integral is given by @xmath79\\right ) \\times ( \\text{quadratic corrections})~,\\ ] ] where the second factor comes from performing the ( gaussian ) integral over the quadratic terms in .",
    "the partition function exhibits qualitatively different behavior depending on whether the minimum of the action is he s or a black hole . for a particular model",
    "the ground state can be readily determined from the values of the boundary conditions : one simply identifies the solutions of the equations of motion that belong to the ensemble , and then determines which solution has the smallest action for the given values @xmath67 and @xmath56 .",
    "evaluating the action for the solutions and gives @xmath80 which is bounded below for finite @xmath56 .",
    "for he s with @xmath81 this becomes @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the value of the dilaton at the origin ( in most of the models we consider , @xmath84 ) . if is less than for all relevant solutions of , then he s is the ground state of the ensemble . on the other hand , if there is a solution of such that is less than , then the ground state of the ensemble is a black hole .",
    "if the values of @xmath67 and @xmath56 are changed then the ground state of the ensemble may change as well , in which case the system will undergo a phase transition involving the nucleation of the new ground state  either a stable black hole or he s . assuming that there is a single minimum of the action that minimize the action .",
    "for instance , it may be possible to tune @xmath67 and @xmath56 so that he s and a black hole both have the same action .",
    "] , the dominant semiclassical contribution to the free energy @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 from this result it is possible to derive all thermodynamical properties of interest , like the entropy and internal energy @xmath87 a comprehensive discussion of thermodynamical properties is provided in @xcite .",
    "a key assumption in the derivation of is that the quadratic term in must be positive definite .",
    "this is just the thermodynamic stability condition that the ground state have positive specific heat at constant dilaton charge .",
    "the specific heat at constant @xmath56 is @xmath88 which yields @xmath89 thus , given boundary conditions @xmath56 and @xmath61 , a canonical ensemble dominated by a black hole exists if the minimum of the action is a solution @xmath90 of , and @xmath91 so that the specific heat is positive .",
    "an important point is that for some theories this inequality can only be realized for finite @xmath56 .",
    "a theory whose boundary conditions and solutions have @xmath92 will not have positive specific heat as @xmath93 , since @xmath94 in this limit . in that case a finite cavity is required for the existence of the canonical ensemble .",
    "the classic example of this phenomenon is the schwarzschild black hole in a theory with asymptotically flat boundary conditions @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the right - hand side of is strictly negative , so a finite cavity is not required for a theory with boundary conditions and solutions such that @xmath95 . in that case",
    "the specific heat remains positive as @xmath93 .",
    "if the action of the black hole is less than the action for he s in this limit , then there is a canonical ensemble with black hole ground state that does not require an external thermal reservoir .",
    "the expression for the specific heat will play an important role in later sections .",
    "this concludes our review of thermodynamics in the euclidean path integral formalism for two - dimensional dilaton gravity . in the rest of the paper",
    "we weaken the assumption of differentiability by considering continuous metrics that no longer satisfy the condition .",
    "let us now reconsider the euclidean partition function . in the previous section we included contributions from smooth field configurations that satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "then the leading term in the semi - classical approximation of the canonical partition function is @xmath96 with @xmath20 being the mass of the smooth solution that minimizes the euclidean action and @xmath97 the on - shell action .",
    "we assume as before that the absolute minimum of the action occurs for a single value of @xmath20 ; otherwise contains a sum over all values of @xmath20 that minimize the action .",
    "we may rewrite as @xmath98 where @xmath99 runs over the physically allowed values of the mass  subject to the condition @xmath100  and the delta - function picks out the value @xmath101 of the smooth solution that minimizes the action .",
    "now suppose that we enlarge the class of field configurations that contribute to @xmath102 by relaxing the assumption of smoothness . instead of imposing the condition for the period ,",
    "we allow for metrics that are continuous but not differentiable at the center of the cavity . in the semiclassical limit",
    ", the largest contributions to the partition function from this sector are expected to come from configurations that ` almost ' meet the conditions for stationary points of the action : they satisfy the equations of motion at all points except for the horizon , where there is a conical singularity . assuming the action is well - defined for these backgrounds , the contributions to @xmath102 take the form without the delta - function as an integral over internal energy @xmath103 with the weight given by @xmath104 . ]",

    "this is accomplished using a smoothing procedure that regulates the defect @xcite .",
    "when the action is evaluated for a black hole with conical singularity the result is independent of the details of the smoothing .",

    "this is not too surprising , since @xmath407 must be held fixed in the @xmath93 limit , which implies @xmath408 .      in this section",
    "we consider three models related to black holes that arise in string theory , either as solutions of the @xmath409-functions at lowest order in @xmath410 , or as exact solutions that incorporate corrections at all orders in @xmath410 .",
    "there is an important difference between this section and the previous ones : the stringy models must be considered with the cavity wall removed . in",
    "string theory one can not introduce new degrees of freedom in an arbitrary manner ( as we have done with the thermal reservoir ) , and _ ad hoc _ cut - offs on spacetime fields ( the restriction @xmath57 on the dilaton ) are usually equivalent to a truncation of states on the worldsheet that spoil the consistency of the theory .",
    "since the models we consider all have non - compact target spaces with @xmath55 asymptotically , the @xmath93 limit is required for any calculations that are meant to be interpreted in the context of string theory .",
    "additional discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that there is an intrinsic way to identify string - like behavior within the zoo of two - dimensional dilaton gravity models .",
    "namely , a universal property of all stringy models is that the weyl - invariant function @xmath166 is linear in the dilaton field @xmath8 for large values of the dilaton ( which means weak coupling from a target - space perspective ) .",
    "linearity of @xmath166 is not just a technical curiosity , but has important physical implications : by virtue of the inequality stringy models always exhibit a hagedorn temperature .",
    "the existence of a hagedorn temperature ( or , equivalently , asymptotic linearity of @xmath166 ) therefore can be considered as a defining property of stringy models .",
    "the witten black hole @xcite is obtained from a solution of bosonic string theory with the worldsheet dynamics described by a @xmath411 coset model .",
    "when the level of the worldsheet current algebra is taken to be large , the tree - level @xmath409-functions at lowest order in @xmath410 have a black hole solution of the form .",
    "the equations may be obtained from an action with @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that @xmath412 with the positive parameter @xmath413 related to the string scale as @xmath414 .",
    "the condition implies that the @xmath93 limit is only defined for this model if @xmath415 . in this",
    "limit the action is @xmath416 the smoothness condition that extremizes the action gives a single value of @xmath241 for which a smooth black hole exists : @xmath417 this corresponds to the hagedorn temperature for the model , at which point contributions from states with a conical singularity at the horizon cause the partition function to diverge .",
    "therefore the @xmath93 limit of this model does not admit an ensemble containing a smooth black hole .",
    "however , one can see from that black hole solutions would have scalar curvature of order @xmath418 near the horizon , indicating that @xmath410 corrections are important . in the next section we will consider a model that takes these corrections into account and always has a black hole ground state .    before moving on it is worth considering two more aspects of the model .",
    "first , the partition function for this model is well - defined in the @xmath93 limit as long as @xmath419 , in which case the ground state is he s .",
    "the integral can be directly evaluated , and gives @xmath420 where @xmath421 is the hagedorn temperature .",
    "second , despite problems with implementing a finite @xmath56 cut - off in string theory , one might consider this model as an example of a dilaton gravity where the contributions to the partition function can be calculated exactly for finite @xmath56 .",
    "the action is @xmath422 with local extrema @xmath215 given by the smoothness condition @xmath423 the ensemble contains a single smooth black hole if @xmath424 , and the action for this configuration is always negative .",
    "thus , there are two phases : a he s ground state for @xmath425 , and a smooth black hole ground state for @xmath424 . the contributions to the partition function from conical singularities can be calculated exactly in either phase by expressing the action in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath426 @xmath427 then the integral is given in terms of exponentials and error functions .",
    "the exact form is not especially enlightening , but the behavior simplifies when @xmath428 . in the low temperature phase @xmath425",
    "we obtain essentially the same result as @xmath429 at high temperatures , @xmath430 , the smooth black hole dominates and the contributions to are approximately @xmath431 where the factor in the exponential is minus the action for the smooth black hole .",
    "the free energy is @xmath432 , and the resulting entropy is @xmath433 unlike the previous examples , the correction does not appear to be proportional to @xmath327",
    ". however , the approximate result assumes @xmath428 , and this assumption must be treated carefully since the model does not have an @xmath93 limit above the hagedorn temperature @xmath434 .",
    "the large-@xmath56 result can only be trusted if @xmath67 remains much less than @xmath435 , which implies that @xmath402 must be close to @xmath436 .",
    "then becomes @xmath437 this is , in a sense , the expected result : the functions that define this model may also be thought of as the @xmath438 limit of the schwarzschild model , and is indeed the @xmath438 limit of .",
    "note , though , that the inverse specific heat for the schwarzschild model goes to zero in this limit , so perhaps a better interpretation of is the leading term in a @xmath439 expansion for large but finite @xmath440 .",
    "the black hole background with @xmath410 corrections taken into account was studied in @xcite .",
    "the worldsheet theory is described by an @xmath411 gauged wzw model with level @xmath441 . as shown in @xcite , the exact string black hole corresponds to a dilaton gravity model with @xmath442 where the field @xmath443 is related to the conventionally defined dilaton @xmath8 by @xmath444 the parameter @xmath445 depends on both the level of the model and the string tension @xmath446 for a critical string theory with a target space of dimension @xmath447 , it satisfies the condition @xmath448 normally this would fix @xmath449 at a specific value ( @xmath450 for a critical string theory in two dimensions ) , but as in @xcite we will assume that extra matter fields are present that contribute to the central charge .",
    "this modifies the condition , which has the effect of allowing us to consider other values of @xmath449 . in practice ,",
    "@xmath445 is treated as a fixed parameter and the level takes values in the range @xmath451 .",

    "computing the entropy from the leading term in the free energy @xmath457 gives @xmath458 now , according to the approximation in section [ sec : partitionfunction ] , the contributions to the partition function from configurations with a conical singularity give @xmath459 which suggests a sub - leading correction to the free energy of the form @xmath460 and consequently a correction to the entropy of the form @xmath461 since we are considering a solution of the genus - zero @xmath409-functions , we must take @xmath462 to ensure that the string coupling is small for any value of @xmath449 . then , in the semiclassical limit @xmath463 the results for @xmath464 and @xmath247 simplify @xmath465 we arrive at an interesting result ; the corrected entropy takes the form @xmath466      the genus - zero beta functions of type 0a string theory have a solution at leading order in @xmath410 that describes a two - dimensional black hole with constant ramond - ramond flux @xcite . this can be viewed as a solution of a model with functions @xmath166 and @xmath332 given by @xmath467 where @xmath468 is positive , and @xmath469 is proportional to the flux of each of the two ramond - ramond gauge fields , in the conventions of @xcite .",
    "this is related to the parameter in @xmath15 by @xmath470 . ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath471 approaches @xmath413 in the limit @xmath55 , indicating that the ensemble is only defined at temperatures below @xmath472 when the cavity wall is removed .",
    "this is the same hagedorn temperature as the witten black hole model , but unlike that model the ensemble now contains a smooth black hole .",
    "the smoothness condition gives @xmath473 which identifies a single black hole @xmath42 for any @xmath474 below the hagedorn temperature @xmath475 combined with the upper limit on the temperature , this result implies that the dilaton at the horizon satisfies @xmath476 .",
    "indeed , it turns out that @xmath477 sets a lower bound on the dilaton at the horizon for any configuration in the ensemble , with or without a conical singularity .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath15 has a minimum at @xmath478 ; the requirement @xmath479 for @xmath480 then implies @xmath481 .",
    "the action for the smooth black hole is @xcite @xmath482 and the action for a configuration with a conical singularity is @xmath483 to determine the ground state , we must compare the action for the smooth black hole to the action for the configuration with @xmath114 taking the the minimum value @xmath484 .",
    "their difference is @xmath485 which is always negative , since the ratio @xmath486 is less than one .",

    "the resulting entropy is @xmath488 we may now consider corrections from configurations with conical singularities .",
    "the integral can be evaluated exactly using incomplete gamma functions , but for our purposes the approximation is sufficient @xmath489 the contribution to the free energy is @xmath490 and the contribution to the entropy is @xmath491 as in the previous two examples , the relation between @xmath247 and @xmath464 is not clear until we consider the conditions for the semiclassical approximation . with",
    "the cavity wall removed , the semiclassical limit is obtained by taking @xmath492 . in that case @xmath247 becomes @xmath493 which is the same general form as the witten model at finite @xmath56 .",
    "we have considered black holes in an unsuitable box  a cavity coupled to a thermal reservoir at a temperature that is in general different than the hawking temperature  and studied the thermodynamics of a ` conical ensemble ' that includes these spaces alongside the more conventional smooth field configurations .",
    "the focus was on black holes that allow an effective description in terms of 2-dimensional dilaton gravity , including schwarzschild , schwarzschild - ads , jackiw - teitelboim and various stringy black holes .",
    "we demonstrated that smooth solutions of the equations of motion are locally ( perturbatively ) stable against singular configurations with a small angular deficit or surplus , proved that the ground state of the conical ensemble never exhibits a conical singularity , and calculated corrections to the entropy and free energy for several pertinent examples .    in all the examples we considered",
    ", configurations with a conical singularity result in corrections to the entropy that take the same form as generic logarithmic corrections from thermal ( and in some cases also quantum ) fluctuations .",
    "in fact , our results can be compared with previous results for entropy corrections from these sorts of fluctuations if the following caveats are taken into account :    1 .   in many cases",
    "existing results have been obtained in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "translating our results , derived in the canonical ensemble , into corrections for the microcanonical entropy changes the sign of the coefficient of the logarithmic term .",
    "matter interactions and non - spherical excitations have been neglected , so naturally we can compare only with results where these contributions are switched off .",
    "3 .   in the schwarzschild model",
    "the partition function does not exist in the @xmath93 limit , so our results are only meaningful for a finite cavity .    with these caveats in mind , we can present the schwarzschild result also as a correction to the microcanonical entropy ( which coincides at leading order with the canonical entropy @xmath464 ) @xmath494 here @xmath495 refers to all matter fields and graviton excitations ( basically their contributions to the trace anomaly ) and @xmath496 is a separate contribution from @xmath497 gauge fields ; our simple approach is not sensitive to either of these contributions .",
    "the result agrees precisely with eq .",
    "( 1.4 ) in @xcite when matter fields are switched off and the graviton excitations are frozen ) contributions .",
    "therefore , this is the appropriate ensemble to compare with .",
    "the 4-dimensional microcanonical result contains an additional contribution coming from the cartan generators of the rotation group , to which our analysis naturally is blind . ] .",
    "likewise , the microcanonical analogs of the entropy corrections for the ads - schwarzschild model and for the btz black hole are the same as the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "we consider this to be a consequence of the semiclassical approximation , where the leading corrections to the partition function are given by a gaussian integral . in both cases",
    " conical singularities and thermal fluctuations ",
    "the coefficient of the quadratic term in the exponent is proportional to @xmath498 ( or @xmath499 ) , leading to similar corrections .    in our analysis",
    "we have only taken into account configurations with a single conical defect , located at the black hole horizon .",
    "a possible generalization is the inclusion of multiple conical defects , which are not necessarily located at the horizon .",
    "this is challenging for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the existence and description of multiple conical singularities on a given space is an open problem that depends on curvature bounds and other model - specific quantities @xcite .",
    "second , the action is not suitable for this purpose .",
    "we have assumed that field configurations in the ensemble exhibit the same symmetries as the cavity . from the point of view of a higher dimensional theory ,",
    "the cavity is spherical and elements of the ensemble are spherically symmetric . including less symmetric configurations in the ensemble requires a more general action that contains terms not present in , and ignoring the contributions from these terms leads to nonsensical results .",
    "for instance , it is tempting to try and study a conical singularity somewhere between the horizon of a smooth black hole and the cavity wall by replacing @xmath500 in with @xmath501 , for some @xmath502 . in any model that admits an @xmath93 limit",
    ", this gives an action that is unbounded below for @xmath503 .",
    "but this pathological behavior is simply the result of neglecting important contributions to the action ; there is no catastrophic instability that suddenly produces conical singularities at large @xmath504 .    one obvious shortcoming of our analysis is that it applies only to black holes that are symmetric enough to allow an effective 2-dimensional description in terms of a dilaton gravity model with action .",
    "it would be of interest to lift our results to higher dimensions , particularly to three and four dimensions . as an example of what one could learn from such a generalization",
    "let us focus on three dimensions .",
    "a few years ago the interest in 3-dimensional ( quantum ) gravity was rekindled , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in particular , maloney and witten showed that the euclidean partition function of pure einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant is not a sensible cft partition function and does not factorize holomorphically @xcite .",
    "they arrived at their result by taking into account all known contributions to the euclidean partition function on the gravity side , assuming smooth metrics , and speculated ( among other logical possibilities ) that the partition function could be made sensible by taking into account configurations with a conical defect .",
    "given the results of the present work this option does not seem to be likely : we have demonstrated in all explicit examples that the leading contribution from conical defects to the partition function behave in the same way as the leading contributions from thermal or quantum fluctuations .",
    "if it remains true in the presence of conical defects that the partition function of 3-dimensional einstein gravity is 1-loop exact , this means that the qualitative features of the partition function are unlikely to change dramatically upon inclusion of conical defects .",
    "it would be of interest to demonstrate this explicitly by lifting our results to three dimensions .",

    "<S> we consider black holes in an `` unsuitable box '' : a finite cavity coupled to a thermal reservoir at a temperature different than the black hole s hawking temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these black holes are described by metrics that are continuous but not differentiable due to a conical singularity at the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> we include them in the euclidean path integral sum over configurations , and analyze the effect this has on black hole thermodynamics in the canonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> black holes with a small deficit ( or surplus ) angle may have a smaller internal energy or larger density of states than the nearby smooth black hole , but they always have a larger free energy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the ground state of the ensemble never possesses a conical singularity . </S>",
    "<S> when the ground state is a black hole , the contributions to the canonical partition function from configurations with a conical singularity are comparable to the contributions from smooth fluctuations of the fields around the black hole background . </S>",
    "<S> our focus is on highly symmetric black holes that can be treated as solutions of two - dimensional dilaton gravity models : examples include schwarzschild , asymptotically anti - de sitter , and stringy black holes . </S>"
