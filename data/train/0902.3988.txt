    "blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies are intrinsically faint , ( e.g. , m@xmath1017 ) compact ( optical radii of a few kpc or smaller ) systems that are undergoing strongly concentrated active star formation . their interstellar media typically produce strong nebular emission lines that suggest sub - solar abundances , as is common for low - mass galaxies in a general sense ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the active star formation regions are typically superposed on an underlying , lower - surface brightness red stellar population .",
    "thus , as expected , bcds have higher central surface brightnesses than do more quiescent dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies .",
    "further , the underlying stellar populations in bcds are also more compact than those in dirr s @xcite , the optical disk scale lengths being systematically shorter .",
    "as expected from their elevated star formation rates , most bcds contain plentiful neutral gas .",
    "when compared with more quiescent dirr galaxies of similar luminosity , bcds typically have h  i  masses that are roughly twice as large @xcite . like the stellar component , this h  i  gas is in general more centrally concentrated than in the dirr population .",
    "the h  i  distributions are often strongly peaked at or near the location of the starburst region @xcite .",
    "these properties suggest that bcds are simply small galaxies with centrally - concentrated mass distributions .",
    "thus , the growing number of low - mass galaxies with extended h  i  disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might be simplistically interpreted as a collection of relatively quiescent dirr systems where the mass is more evenly distributed throughout the disk than in bcds .",
    "likewise , a centrally - concentrated h  i  or stellar distribution might be the signpost of a bcd .",
    "strong departures from this simple paradigm would be found in star forming galaxies that have extreme stellar and gaseous properties : the compact stellar bodies typical of bcds and the extended h  i  gas disks typical of more quiescent irregular galaxies .",
    "while examples of bcds with large h  i  envelopes exist ( e.g. , ngc2915 ; meurer etal.1994 , 1996 ) , we do not yet have sufficient statistics on the resolved characteristics of the gaseous components of bcd systems to determine if such remarkable properties are common or rare .",
    "further , few systems with extremely compact stellar populations ( optical scale lengths @xmath111 kpc ) have been identified to date ; such stellar distributions are exceptional even among the bcd class .",
    "to explore this uncharted territory , we present in this work new optical and h  i  spectral line observations of adbs113845@xmath02008 ( hereafter adbs1138 ) , an extremely compact bcd surrounded by an enormous h  i  disk .",
    "initially discovered in the _ arecibo dual beam survey _ ( adbs ) @xcite ,",
    "it was subsequently cataloged as a uv - excess source in the 2nd kiso survey ( miyauchi - isobe & maehara , 2000 ) .",
    "its extremely compact nature was first recognized during a ccd imaging study of the adbs galaxies ( see section 2.1 ) , which motivated us to carry out the more detailed study of this interesting system presented here .",
    "in addition to describing our new optical and radio data , this paper discusses the morphology and kinematics of the neutral gas , the nature of the h  i  ring and central depression , and different scenarios that may produce the curious features of the ism in adbs1138 .",
    "optical imaging of adbs1138  through b , v and r filters was carried out using the _ wiyn _",
    "0.9-meter telescope located on kitt peak .",
    "the data were obtained on 5 may 2003 as part of a larger program to study the optical properties of the full adbs sample ( stevenson etal .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the exceptionally compact nature of this system was evident immediately .",
    "in fact , in our initial analysis of the ccd images we did nt recognize adbs1138  as a galaxy at all , but rather took it to be a foreground star . only after manipulating the image intensity and measuring the fwhm of several objects",
    "did we identify it as a galaxy .",
    "figure  [ figcap1](a ) , obtained from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , shows the immediate field surrounding the galaxy ; note that it is only slightly more extended than the nearby foreground star to the southwest .",
    "the measured b - band apparent magnitude of adbs1138  is 16.51 . assuming a distance of 42.1 mpc ( h@xmath12 = 73 kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 ) , the absolute magnitude of adbs1138  ( corrected for foreground extinction of 0.097 mag ) is m@xmath14 @xmath1516.71 .",
    "this corresponds to l@xmath14 = 7.44@xmath710@xmath16 l@xmath2 ( assuming m@xmath175.47 ; see cox 2000 ) . the system has a b - band exponential scale length of only @xmath10.57 kpc ( see figure  [ figcap2 ] ) .",
    "this can be compared to a typical scale length of 1.54@xmath180.22 kpc for other dwarfs in the adbs sample with similar luminosities .",
    "examination of both our _ wiyn _",
    "0.9-meter images and the _ sdss _ data reveal a compact , featureless morphology .",
    "furthermore , the galaxy appears to be quite isolated ; no optical or h  i - rich objects with a comparable redshift are located within @xmath116  of adbs1138  ( half of the h  i  primary beam at 21 cm ; see section  [ s2.2 ] ) , corresponding to @xmath1195 kpc at the adopted distance .",
    "we also obtained h@xmath9  narrow - band imaging with the _ wiyn _ 0.9-m telescope on 2 april 2005 .",
    "the h@xmath9  emission from adbs1138comes solely from the compact core of the galaxy , and is unresolved in our images .",
    "the measured flux derived from our image is 2.98@xmath710@xmath19 ergs@xmath13@xmath5 . after applying modest corrections for foreground galactic extinction ( a@xmath20 0.06 mag , schlegel etal .",
    "1998 ) , internal absorption in the galaxy , and [ n ii ] nebular emission present in our narrow - band filter , we arrive at a corrected h@xmath9  flux of 3.65@xmath710@xmath19 ergs@xmath13@xmath5 . at our adopted distance",
    "this corrected flux corresponds to a luminosity of 7.75@xmath710@xmath21 ergs@xmath13 . applying the conversion to sfr from @xcite ,",
    "adbs1138  has a current sfr of 0.06 m@xmath2yr@xmath13 .",
    "optical spectroscopy of adbs1138  was obtained with the _ mmt _ 6.5 m telescope on 5 february 2006 using the blue channel spectrograph and a 300 l / mm grating .",
    "a slit width of 1.5  was employed , and the total integration time was 30 minutes , split between two exposures .",
    "data processing followed standard practices ; the wavelength scale was assigned using exposures of a henear lamp , and the flux scale was obtained by measurement of several spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "the resulting spectrum , shown in figure  [ figcap1](b ) , allows us to estimate the nebular abundance of adbs1138 to be @xmath130% z@xmath2 , using the `` strong - line '' method of @xcite .",
    "we measure an optical recession velocity of 3076@xmath1814 kms@xmath13 .",
    "h@xmath9  and [ ]",
    "emission lines are prominent ; the spectrum also reveals ca  ii  k , mg  b , and na  d absorption features , and considerable absorption in the higher - order balmer series transitions . taken together",
    ", these features indicate the presence of a substantial population of older stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and imply a higher sfr in the past than at the present epoch ( i.e. , that the system is in a `` post - starburst '' state ) .",

    "observations were obtained in the c and d arrays on 2006 october 31 and 2007 march 30 , respectively ; integration times were @xmath1243 and @xmath187 minutes for the target source during these two observing sessions .",

    "the 5@xmath27 upper limit to the 1.4 ghz radio continuum flux density is derived to be s@xmath281.3 mjy .",
    "this is consistent with the nvss non - detection @xcite .",
    "the expected thermal radio continuum flux density , based on the ( foreground extinction - corrected ) h@xmath9  flux , is between 0.040.06 mjy ( depending on the adopted electron temperature ; see caplan & deharveng 1986 ) .",
    "thus , even if nonthermal processes dominate the radio continuum flux , it is below our current sensitivity level to study in detail .",
    "h  i  in adbs1138  is detected over the ( heliocentric ) velocity range 3010@xmath153140 kms@xmath13 ; figure  [ figcap3 ] shows channel maps of h  iemission in the central 25 channels of the cube . from these maps",
    "it is clear that the profile is double - peaked ; this is verified when all emission defined as real ( i.e. , all emission contributing to the moment maps ) is summed and plotted against velocity in the global h  iprofile shown in figure  [ figcap4 ] . from this profile and rotation curve analysis ( see below ) , we derive a systemic velocity of v@xmath29 3074@xmath181 kms@xmath13  which is in excellent agreement with the measured optical velocity ( see   [ s2.1 ] ) .",
    "integrating under the h  i  profile , we derive a total h  i  flux s @xmath3 2.58@xmath180.26 jykms@xmath13 .",
    "this can be compared to the lower value of 1.98 jykms@xmath13  derived from _",

    "note that such disagreement between single - dish and interferometric observations were common in the adbs sample ; of the 31 galaxies observed by @xcite with both the _ vla _ and _ arecibo _ , 85% have higher interferometric than single - dish h  i  fluxes . at the adopted distance of 42.1 mpc",
    ", this flux integral translates to a total h  i  mass of ( 1.08@xmath180.22)@xmath710@xmath25 m@xmath2 .",
    "combining with the b - band luminosity ( 7.44@xmath710@xmath16 l@xmath2 ) implies m@xmath30/l@xmath14 @xmath11.45 .    in figure  [ figcap5 ]",

    "it is immediately striking that neutral gas extends @xmath6125  ( @xmath625 kpc ) from the optical component . comparing to the b - band scale length ( @xmath10.57 kpc )",
    ", the h  i  disk is @xmath144 times larger than the b - band exponential scale length .    comparing to other `` giant disk '' dwarf galaxies in the literature ,",
    "we conclude that adbs1138  is among the most extended h  i  systems known . due to the very compact nature of adbs1138 , and to potential contamination of a surface brightness estimate ( e.g. , when measuring the holmberg radius ) due to the bright foreground star in the southwest ( see figure  [ figcap1 ] ) , we choose for this comparison the ratio of h  i  size at the 10@xmath4 @xmath5 level to the b - band exponential scale length .",
    "we denote this parameter as @xmath31(h  i / b ) ; as shown in table  [ t2 ] , other `` giant disk '' dwarf galaxies have similar , but slightly smaller values of this parameter .",
    "each of these systems shows extreme properties when comparing the stellar and gaseous components .",
    "the optical scale length of adbs1138  does not vary appreciably with wavelength in the _ sdss _ bands ( see also figure  [ figcap2 ] .",
    "this suggests that we are likely observing the entire stellar component at these wavelengths .",
    "if the galaxy harbors an extended , low - surface brightness disk , then this component must have a surface brightness well below the sensitivity of our optical images ( 26.0 , 25.5 mag arcsec@xmath32 in the b and v bands , respectively ) .",
    "as a point of reference we note that deep optical imaging of 27 compact emission - line galaxies ( which are a class of objects that are brighter than adbs 1138 ) by @xcite finds extended , low surface brightness emission in only 1 case .",
    "the highest column density gas in adbs1138  is located in a broken ring structure that is significantly beyond the optical component . moving outward from the dynamical center ( which corresponds closely with the stellar component ;",
    "see detailed discussion in   [ s3.2 ] ) , figure  [ figcap6 ] shows that the h  i  surface brightness peaks at a radius of @xmath140  ( 8 kpc ) .",
    "the h  i  surface brightness falls by nearly 50% moving inward toward the optical component .",
    "therefore , the shell is @xmath615 kpc in diameter , making it one of the largest such features known in any dwarf galaxy .",
    "the mass of gas in the h  iring , integrated radially from 5 to 12 kpc , is ( 5.2@xmath180.6)@xmath710@xmath33 m@xmath2 .",
    "thus , this structure accounts for roughly half of the total h  i  mass in adbs1138 .",
    "equally remarkable is the modest strength of the integrated h  iemission .",
    "examining the `` high - resolution '' column density map in figure  [ figcap5 ] , h  i  column densities peak at values of 3.8@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath5 and fall below 2@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath5 at the location of the optical component of the galaxy .",
    "a number of authors have demonstrated a correlation between h  i  column density and ongoing star formation ; the canonical `` schmidt star formation law '' suggests that h  icolumns of @xmath110@xmath34 @xmath5 are strongly correlated with instantaneous star formation tracers , including h@xmath9  ( see skillman 1987 , kennicutt 1989 , 1998b , and references therein ) .",
    "the h@xmath9  image in figure  [ figcap5 ] shows that adbs1138  has spatially concentrated ongoing star formation ( 0.06 m@xmath2yr@xmath13 ) .",
    "emission is associated with recent massive star formation ( i.e. , stars with masses @xmath610 m@xmath2  and main sequence lifetimes @xmath1120 myr ; see kennicutt 1998a ) . however , at the physical resolutions of our h  i  data , we find star formation _ only _ in the central , low - column density region .",
    "we discuss the constraints our data offer on this puzzle in   [ s4 ] .",
    "in figure  [ figcap7 ] we present the velocity structure of the adbs1138  system at 20  and 40  resolution .",
    "a general inspection shows that the system is undergoing well - ordered rotation throughout most of the inner disk ( but note that the slope of the curve changes at our physical resolutions in the inner regions of the galaxy ) .",
    "isovelocity contours appear evenly spaced and are mostly regular along the h  i  minor axis .",
    "we fit this velocity field using tilted ring models via the rotcur task in gipsy .",
    "while the size of the galaxy compared to our smaller beam size ( 20 ) does not lend itself to detailed rotation curve analysis with large numbers of independent points , we can extract a clean first - order measurement of the large - scale kinematics of the neutral gas .",
    "rotcur fits the systemic velocity ( v@xmath35 ) , rotation velocity , position angle ( p.a .",
    ", measured as positive when rotating eastward from north ) , inclination _ i _ , and dynamical center position , each as a function of radius , to an observed velocity field .",
    "we began by fitting the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "as is apparent from figure  [ figcap5 ] , the inclination of the galaxy is small .",
    "it is well - known that an accurate measurement of _ i _ in face - on galaxies is difficult @xcite .",
    "initial rotcur fits to all parameters estimated _ i _ between @xmath110  and @xmath140 , depending on the initial coordinates of the dynamical center position .",
    "we constrained the angle by forcing the fitted rotation velocities ( proportional to sin(_i ) _ ) to reach maxima commensurate with the observed velocity field .",
    "this narrowed the allowable range of inclinations to 2832 ; we fixed _",
    "i _ at 30  for the remainder of our analysis .",
    "we then began fitting individual parameters of the rotation curve using annuli of different widths ( 5 , 10 , 20 ) .",
    "while the former two analyses do not provide independent points , they do allow us to gauge the observed small - scale changes in parameters that affect our analysis .",
    "we compare values for a given parameter using the fitted models at each resolution , and select a `` best - fit '' value that is consistent with all three fits . in most cases ,",
    "the differences from one model to the next were negligible .",
    "v@xmath35 ( 3074@xmath181 kms@xmath13 ) and the dynamical center position ( 11:38:45.3 , 20:08:26.5 ) were fit individually using this approach , and then held constant at all radii in subsequent model fits .",
    "the p.a . , which is allowed to vary as a function of radius , was then fit with all other parameters held constant .",

    "it is obvious that a broken , roughly spherical structure exists in the ism of adbs1138  at a distance of @xmath17.5 kpc from the dynamical center .",

    "radius - velocity diagrams do not show the characteristic elliptical structure that would be expected if the h  iring was in fact expanding along the line of sight .",
    "we note that this galaxy is observed at a small inclination ( _ i _ was fixed at 30  in the rotation curve analysis above ) ; for nearly face - on galaxies there might be structures that are expanding in the disk ( perpendicular to the line of sight ) but whose mass outflow perpendicular to the disk is small ( hence undetectable ) .",

    "combining our total gas mass measurement ( see above ) and this ( coarse ) stellar mass estimate , we find that the dynamical mass exceeds the luminous mass by a factor of 9 ( at a radius of 10 kpc ) to 15 ( at the last measured point of the rotation curve ) .",
    "like many dwarf galaxies , adbs1138 is a dark matter dominated system .",
    "we apparently have sampled the turn - over of the outer rotation curve ( see figure  [ figcap8 ] ) ; this suggests that we have measured the bulk of the galaxy s dark matter halo .",
    "adbs1138  presents intriguing problems : 1 ) how can star formation proceed at the current time in regions far below the `` canonical '' star formation threshold column density of @xmath110@xmath34 @xmath5 ?",
    "2 ) what gives rise to a giant ordered disk that only forms stars in the very central region ? in this section we discuss two potential evolutionary scenarios for this system . in the first we consider `` inside - out '' processes : here we assume that the structures we observe in the neutral gas disk are a result of star formation processes . in the second we consider `` outside - in '' scenarios , where we assume that the large h  i  disk has been stable for a significant fraction of a hubble time , and that the recent star formation we observe is a result of small - scale stochastic effects that caused the neutral gas to attain critical density only in the very innermost regions .",
    "we first consider the `` inside - out '' scenario wherein the ring - like h  i  distribution is the result of `` feedback '' from recent star formation .",
    "if a recent star formation episode was sufficiently energetic , one might expect the mechanical luminosity from stellar winds and sne to be driving h  i  away from the stellar component .",
    "numerous nearby dwarf galaxies have interstellar media displaying such kinematic structures ( e.g. , puche etal .  1992 , kim etal .  1999 , walter & brinks 1999 , ott etal",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "the depressed column densities around the optical component ( compared to `` canonical '' expectations based on the ongoing star formation ; see references above ) , coupled with the apparent `` post - starburst '' nature of the galaxy , make this scenario appealing .",
    "the compact stellar component implies that all mechanical energy input from previous bursts would be highly concentrated spatially ; adbs1138  appears to possess the necessary conditions for the creation of a large h  ishell in a low mass galaxy . here",
    ", we can exploit the kinematic information available in our spectral line data to discern if the neutral gas is in fact being driven outward from the galaxy",
    ".    it would be instructive to consider the energetics necessary to create such a coherent structure in the ism .",
    "ideally we would have the signature of expansion of the ring ; using this velocity and the observed size of the structure one can obtain a first - order estimate of the requisite energy and age from basic first principles .",
    "however , in the case of adbs1138 , we do not detect expansion and thus have no such estimate of the velocity ; this relegates us to a first - order estimate of the ring energetics .",
    "we begin by assuming that the extended h  ienvelope of adbs1138  existed with more or less its current physical size at the beginning of a putative ( presumably violent ) starburst episode that was concentrated in the central region ( coincident with the optical component ) .",
    "the low column densities throughout the extended disk are not unlike those found in the outer disks of nearby dwarf galaxies with extended h  i  envelopes @xcite .",
    "we then assume that the mass of gas in the ring was distributed uniformly throughout the central region of the galaxy , presumably providing plentiful neutral gas that gave rise to the starburst event inferred from the spectrum shown in figure  [ figcap1 ] .    as shown in ",
    "[ s3.1 ] , the mass of gas in the h  i  ring is ( 5.2@xmath180.6)@xmath710@xmath33 m@xmath2 . assuming a symmetric potential interior to and inclusive of the ring , this mass has a potential energy of @xmath110@xmath42 erg at the present time . for this gas to be moved radially",
    "outward a distance of @xmath17.5 kpc as a result of spatially and temporally concentrated star formation , the kinetic energy inputs of some thousands of sne would be required .",
    "given a characteristic starburst duration of @xmath1100 myr @xcite , a constant - velocity expansion rate of @xmath170 kms@xmath13  is inferred ; a longer - duration burst would decrease the constant expansion velocity .",
    "it is interesting to note that expanding shells in other galaxies have been found that require energies of roughly the same order as those inferred here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this interpretation is seriously weakened by the lack of observed expansion in the ring itself .",
    "of course it is possible that the kinetic energy of the once - expanding ring has been expended , that pressure equilibrium with the surrounding ism has been reached , and that the expansion has stopped . without a definitive measurement of expansion we must estimate the total mechanical energy input from previous star formation and subsequent stellar evolution .",
    "coupled with the enormous size of the ring compared to the stellar component , we conclude that the ring structure in adbs1138 was most likely not created by concentrated star formation alone .",
    "we again draw attention to the size of the ring structure ; the radius of 7.5 kpc greatly exceeds the physical sizes of some of the largest h  i  structures that have been attributed to stellar evolution processes ( e.g. , ngc6822 - de  blok & walter 2000 ; holmbergi - ott etal.2001 ) .",
    "examples of `` ring - like '' galaxies have been identified in the literature , either on the basis of a visually - obvious depression and surrounding ring of higher column densities ( e.g. , simpson etal .",
    "2005 ) or on the basis of radially - integrated h  i  surface density profiles ( e.g. , walter etal .  2007 ) .",
    "centrally - concentrated star formation is argued to produce the observed structures in some of these galaxies , even in cases where no expansion is detected .",
    "thus , what makes adbs1138  remarkable is not the rarity of ring structures in dwarf galaxies , but rather the comparative sizes of the optical and gaseous components .",
    "we stress that the optical component of adbs1138(measured by the b - band exponential scale length ) is more than 40 times smaller than the extended h  i  halo ( measured as the average radius at which the column density falls to the 10@xmath4 @xmath5 level ) .",
    "ongoing star formation is detected only in the compact optical component .",
    "the shortcomings noted above lead us to consider an alternative , `` outside - in '' scenario for the recent evolution of adbs1138 . we postulate that the extended , relatively tenuous ( i.e. , low column density ) h  i  disk has remained stable for essentially a hubble time , with star formation occurring only in very localized regions . in most respects",
    "the h  i  disk in adbs1138  is like the h  i  disks typically associated with low - mass galaxies : coherent and ordered rotation , with sub - critical column densities throughout most of the disk .",
    "few locations within this extended neutral gas halo have attained the requisite gas densities to initiate star formation ; at present , the only such location is the very innermost region of the disk .",
    "given the very compact stellar component in the optical bands , it follows that star formation has likely been concentrated in this very inner region over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "however , at this physical resolution , we do not detect high column density h  i  gas at the location of the optical component ( though molecular gas may be present ; see discussion below ) .",
    "we thus postulate that localized star formation has been efficient at depleting the neutral gas in this central region .",
    "whatever h  i  gas that gave rise to the present ( and past ) star formation at this location is either very spatially concentrated ( and thus undetected due to beam smearing effects at our resolution ) or has been consumed in the star formation process .",
    "in contrast , the vast majority of the disk is made up of tenuous , sub - critical gas undergoing ordered rotation that is not associated with ongoing star formation .",
    "we thus further postulate that the global star formation has been exceedingly inefficient .    while the efficiency with which stars are formed in the ism has been long - studied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is difficult to state with certainty the `` average '' efficiency of star formation in dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite find differences in the implied star formation efficiencies between a sample of low surface brightness dwarfs and `` normal '' gas - rich dwarfs , but no apparent distinction between the two samples based on the strength of current star formation .",
    "thus , star formation in dwarfs appears to be a stochastic process : where dense neutral gas is located , stars will form .",
    "the physical mechanism(s ) that initiate(s ) this process are widely debated .",
    "two of the most common drivers speculated to be operating in dwarfs are interactions and turbulence ; we briefly discuss both mechanisms below .",
    "galaxy - scale interactions are widely postulated to compress gas in galaxies , thereby triggering starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in massive disk galaxies in group environments ,",
    "this process is frequent ; this is a well - studied driver of galaxy evolution .",
    "however , in low - mass galaxies , the role of interactions is more difficult to quantify .",
    "we know that interactions of dwarfs with massive systems leads to disruption and accretion of the dwarf by the more massive system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the frequency and results of mergers or interactions between two low - mass systems are not constrained observationally . assuming that such scenarios occur ( requiring either close pairs of galaxies , or neutral gas clouds of roughly dwarf galaxy mass interacting with dwarfs ) , it is logical to assume similar impacts in the low - mass galaxies as those seen in the more massive systems .",
    "this scenario is attractive in that it provides a simple explanation for the observed properties of the adbs1138  system .",
    "in such a model , at some time in the past , a low - mass object underwent a strong interaction with the neutral gas disk of this system .",
    "the interaction drives gas into the inner disk , at which point critical gas density is achieved and stars begin to form in earnest .    at the present time , adbs1138  appears to be an isolated galaxy .",
    "searching our `` low - resolution '' datacube we find no ( gas - rich ) companion or interacting galaxy at our current sensitivity level .",
    "we note that the _ vla _ primary beam at 21 cm ( @xmath132 ) corresponds to a circular field size of radius @xmath1195 kpc at our adopted distance .",
    "any relatively massive ( m@xmath43 @xmath110@xmath44 m@xmath2 ) companion within this projected separation would have been detected in our data . if such an interaction scenario is correct , then the lack of a ( gas - rich ) companion might be explained by either the process occurring long ago ( allowing the h  i  disk time to recover stability ) or by the companion being completely accreted in the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "alternatively , turbulent motions in the ism of adbs1138  may have initiated and sustained star formation in the inner disk .",
    "it is widely suggested that the ism of dwarf galaxies are fractal in nature , with turbulence playing an important role in regulating the star formation process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , we also note that direct comparisons of simple turbulent models with observations sometimes are more successful in massive spirals than in irregulars @xcite .",
    "if the inner disk of adbs1138  contains substantial turbulent motion , then this conceivably could lead to ongoing star formation .",
    "`` feedback '' from this star formation will unleash mechanical energy into the ism , potentially contributing to the turbulent nature of the ism and thereby sustaining the star formation within the disk .",
    "given the difficulties of completely removing the ism from dwarf galaxies that are undergoing star formation events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such a scenario appears to be a viable ( though overly simplistic ) model of the evolution of adbs1138 .",
    "we note that there is likely a molecular component of the ism to which we are not sensitive with these data . moving inward through the disk , the ism may simply become predominantly molecular inside of @xmath1 7.5 kpc ; examples of this transition are numerous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this may provide a logical explanation for the ring structure and for the depressed column densities in the central region .",
    "this putative molecular gas must still be relatively tenuous , since we only observe ongoing star formation in one relatively small region within the ring .",
    "while there may be widespread molecular gas inside the ring , only the innermost @xmath11 kpc appears to have had sufficient densities to support star formation within the past @xmath120 myr .",
    "based on the nebular abundance ( @xmath130% z@xmath2 ) , and the known problems of studying molecular gas at low metallicities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , studying the morphology and kinematics of this molecular gas will be difficult ( see also the study by leroy etal .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "considering the low dust contents typically associated with metal - poor dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is unlikely that adbs1138  hosts undetected or embedded star formation ( although examples have been identified ; see cannon etal.2006 ) .",
    "we wish to stress that we do not advocate for the youth of adbs1138 ; we have no evidence that this is a `` primordial '' galaxy . on the contrary , we see evidence for an older stellar population in our spectrum . unfortunately , the large distance to adbs1138  ( @xmath142 mpc ) precludes resolved stellar population work that would provide characteristics of this older stellar population . rather than being a `` young '' galaxy",
    ", we postulate that adbs1138  is an apparently rare system in the local universe ; the large h  i  disk is very stable and shows no signs of recent tidal interaction .",
    "the star formation in the very innermost region of the disk ( where the red stellar population is located ) was stronger in the past .",
    "taken as a whole , the lines of evidence provided by h  i  spectral line and optical imaging paints a very intriguing picture .",
    "adbs1138  is a relatively massive system compared to other dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the tenuous h  i  appears to be very stable and to be happily evolving in isolation at the present time . in the very innermost region ,",
    "the requisite conditions for star formation were met ; we speculate that a low - mass merger event or turbulent processes may have been important in initiating and/or regulating this star formation .",
    "we favor an `` outside - in '' scenario to explain the observed features of adbs1138 ; while this model is simplistic and has shortcomings , it appears to be in better agreement with the data than the `` inside - out '' models discussed in   [ s4.1 ]",
    "we have presented new optical imaging and spectroscopy and h  ispectral line imaging of the intriguing bcd galaxy adbs1138 .",
    "this system displays extreme characteristics that differentiate it from the `` typical '' dwarf galaxy in the local universe .",
    "first , from optical imaging , this system harbors ongoing star formation in an extremely compact stellar distribution .",
    "the b - band exponential scale length is only 0.57 kpc .",
    "while more compact systems have been found , both among the bcd and the `` ultra - compact dwarf '' populations , the latter are typically `` threshed '' systems that are the remnant nucleii of disrupted dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "adbs1138  is one of the most optically compact , isolated , star - forming dwarf galaxies known to date .",
    "the compact optical component is in stark contrast to the extremely extended neutral gas disk .",
    "the h  i  disk is @xmath144 times larger than the b - band exponential scale length ; this makes adbs1138  the most h  i - extended galaxy known .",
    "if a low surface brightness stellar component exists , it must be very faint indeed ; we find very little variation of optical scale length with _",
    "sdss _ observing band .",
    "sensitive mid - infrared imaging would be insightful to probe the total stellar extent of the system .",
    "the h  i  morphology is dominated by a broken ring @xmath17.5 kpc in radius , centered on the optical component .",
    "nowhere in the galaxy do h  i  column densities rise above the `` canonical '' star formation surface density threshold of 10@xmath34 @xmath5 ( though beam smearing effects may be important ) .",
    "rather , the optical component occupies only the very innermost portion of an otherwise stable , extended h  idisk .",
    "the resolution of our data ( 20  = 4.08 kpc ) precludes a detailed , spatially resolved toomre q analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent studies of nearby galaxies have shown close agreement between h  i  column density and toomre q parameter as predictors of locations of active star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; higher spatial resolution observations would allow more detailed analysis of the stability of the large h  i  disk in adbs1138 .",
    "we investigate the kinematics of this ring structure in both position - velocity and radius - velocity space .",
    "we find no clear signatures of large - scale expansion of this feature .",
    "while very coarse estimates of the energy required to create the ring are available from simple potential arguments , we are unable to definitively conclude that coherent star formation and subsequent stellar evolution is responsible for the creation of this ring feature . based on optical spectra that show `` post - starburst '' characteristics , this scenario is appealing : a compact stellar distribution would imply spatially concentrated energy input by massive star evolution .",
    "however , given the physical size and the kinematically static nature of the ring , we seek an alternative explanation for the ring s origin .",
    "we consider evolution in the `` outside - in '' sense , where the h  i  disk has been stable for essentially a hubble time , and where localized , stochastic effects have initiated the growth of the stellar population .",
    "we speculate on two possible mechanisms of this ongoing star formation : minor - minor merger / interaction or interstellar turbulence .",
    "while the distance of adbs1138  precludes resolved stellar population work that would more accurately constrain the age of the stellar population , we infer that this is not a young galaxy .",
    "rather , we have discovered an apparently rare object that appears content to evolve in quiescent isolation ; inefficient global star formation has produced a system with a very concentrated stellar population but with an enormously extended h  i  disk .    within the inner disk , the neutral gas is undergoing the ordered rotation that is typical of many dwarf galaxies .",
    "we sample the rotation curve past the point where it turns over , indicating that we have determined the size of the dark matter halo of this system .",
    "simple arguments yield a total dynamical mass of ( 24)@xmath710@xmath26 m@xmath2  ( depending on the selected distance from the dynamical center ) .",
    "this outweighs the luminous matter ( gas @xmath0 stars , without an explicit estimate of the molecular gas mass ) by at least a factor of 15 .",
    "the curious properties of adbs1138  raise important questions . what fraction of emission - line dwarfs display such compact optical bodies ?",
    "are large h  i  halos common amongst such systems , or is adbs1138  unique ?",
