    "attaining the vacuum instability in a strong , macroscopically extended electromagnetic field through spontaneous creation of electron - positron pairs represents a major incentive for quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and various branches of high - energy physics . for the case of a static electric field , the corresponding schwinger rate of pair production ( pp ) has the form @xmath1 @xcite , where @xmath2 is the applied field and @xmath3 the critical field of qed . and @xmath4 are the electron mass and its absolute charge , respectively",
    ". the speed of light in vacuum and the planck constant will be denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . ] due to its non - analytic field dependence , the schwinger effect exhibits a manifestly nonperturbative character . its experimental observation , while being highly desirable , has been prevented until now by the huge value of @xmath7 which is not accessible in the laboratory yet .",
    "it would not only verify a central prediction of qed , but also have implications for various other phenomena which share its principal features @xcite .",
    "substantial efforts are being spent to bring the schwinger effect into experimental reach .",
    "the next generation of high - intensity laser facilities currently under construction is expected to reach peak field intensities on the order of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding electric fields , having micrometer extensions and femtosecond durations , reach the percent level of the critical field @xmath9 . to further increase the chance for an experimental realization of schwinger pp , theoreticians have proposed to superimpose multiple laser beams @xcite , exploit the lorentz boost inherent to relativistic particle - laser beam collisions @xcite or enhance the rate by the aid of an assisting high - frequency ( photon ) field @xcite .",
    "while these sorts of facilitated schwinger pp are very promising , they do not constitute the only way of probing the vacuum instability .",
    "alternatively , one may follow a complementary route by inspecting physical environments where analogues of the schwinger effect arise whose detection might be easier . since its recent discovery , graphene @xcite has become an ideal candidate for such a purpose .",
    "fermionic quasiparticles close to one of the two @xmath10 points in this two dimensional monolayer of carbon atoms behave like relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "they feature a dispersion relation like dirac fermions , with the speed of light @xmath5 being replaced by the fermi velocity @xmath11 , and the eigenstates have a dirac spinor structure in sublattice space . as a consequence ,",
    "fundamental phenomena of relativistic quantum physics find their low - energy counterpart in graphene , such as klein tunneling @xcite , coulomb supercriticality @xcite , many - body renormalization effects @xcite , or universal scaling phenomena @xcite .",
    "also the analogue of schwinger pp , i.e. , field - induced creation of particle - hole pairs via low - energy electronic excitations from valence to conduction band in graphene has been studied theoretically .",
    "the process was examined by methods of @xmath0-dimensional qed in a constant electric background @xcite , a sauter - like field @xcite , and an electric field oscillating in time @xcite .",
    "the lack of an energy gap at the @xmath10 points in graphene implies , however , that the charge carriers behave like massless dirac fermions .",
    "this property prevents the existence of a critical field in graphene and , thus , the exponential suppression of the production rate which represents a main characteristic of the original schwinger effect .",
    "there are various techniques to induce a bandgap @xmath12 in graphene , e.g. , by epitaxial growth on suitable substrates @xcite , elastic strain @xcite , or rashba spin splittings on magnetic substrates @xcite . then a non - zero mass @xmath13 is associated with the charge carriers whose high mobility still resembles the one of relativistic particles as long as their momenta lie below @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the phenomenology of the field - induced particle - hole production process can be expected to show characteristics much closer to the electron - positron pp in qed .",
    "such an analogy offers an ideal opportunity of getting valuable insights about the original schwinger mechanism in an experimentally accessible low - energy domain .",
    "this is the motivation for the present study .    in this paper , we calculate the production of pairs of massive dirac particles from the quantum field theoretic ground state in an external electric field . starting from the well - known qed description of the process in @xmath15 dimensions , we develop a formalism in reduced dimensionality which is applicable to bandgap graphene layers .",
    "analytical results for the production rate in a constant electric field ( cef ) are obtained .",
    "for an electric field oscillating in time , the production rate and the momentum distribution of created particles are examined by numerical calculations .",
    "we demonstrate that  similar to pp in the unstable qed vacuum  the production of electron - hole pairs in a vicinity of the dirac points in graphene layers is governed by a kinetic equation characterized by a non - markovian nature and describe suitable field parameters for experimental observation of the effect .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qka ] we describe some basic features of the pp process in an external electric field in @xmath15-dimensional qed .",
    "afterwards , by compactifying spatial dimensions , the quantum kinetic boltzmann - vlasov equations in @xmath0 and @xmath16 dimensions are derived .",
    "the outcomes of this analyses are first applied to the case of a constant external electric field , where agreement with previous studies is found .",
    "this part is followed by a subsection which exposes the details necessary for applying the kinetic equation in @xmath0-dimensions to graphene layers .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] for the particular situation in which the electric field oscillates in time .",
    "we discuss the resonant effects and rabi - like oscillations which arise in the single - particle distribution function . the density of pairs yielded is also investigated .",
    "further comments and remarks are given in the conclusion .",
    "first , we shall investigate the production of pairs in a field as can be conceived from laser waves . however , its description represents a major task from both analytic and numeric viewpoints .",
    "difficulties , introduced by the unavoidably complicated nature of such a wave , are frequently simplified for the sake of having a concise analytical description of the production process . and @xmath17 vanish identically , and the vacuum - vacuum transition amplitude does not decay against electron - positron pairs @xcite . ]",
    "a first step towards this direction is taken by considering an electric - like background which can be obtained  to a good approximation  through a head - on collision of two linearly polarized laser pulses with equal intensities , frequencies and polarization directions .",
    "the field which results from this procedure is a spatially inhomogeneous standing electromagnetic wave depending upon the temporal coordinate .",
    "however , for the numeric treatment , the dependence on the space coordinates still constitutes an important issue which is frequently avoided , although there exist already some first results including their effects @xcite . because of this , most of the studies developed in this research area consider the simplest model in which the background is a homogeneously distributed electric field oscillating in time @xcite .",
    "there exist various theoretical approaches for describing the spontaneous production of electron - positron pairs in an external electromagnetic field .",
    "many of them rely on the theoretical framework of qed in unstable vacuum @xcite . in the case of a spatially homogeneous but time dependent electric field @xmath18 ,",
    "such a framework allows us to undertake the problem either through the s - matrix formalism @xcite or from the transport theory point of view @xcite .",
    "both formulations are equivalent and complement each other . in this paper , we adopt the latter description which underlines the nonequilibrium nature of the pp . in this context , its investigation is carried out in terms of the distribution function @xmath19 of electrons and positrons to which the degrees of freedom in the external field are relaxed at asymptotically large times [ @xmath20 , i.e. , when the electric field is switched off @xmath21 . the time evolution of this quantity is dictated by a quantum kinetic equation involving a pronounced non - markovian feature : . ] @xmath22\\nonumber\\\\&&\\qquad\\quad\\qquad\\times\\cos\\left[2\\int_{t^\\prime}^t dt^{\\prime\\prime}\\ \\mathpzc{w}_{\\pmb{p}}(t^{\\prime\\prime})\\right],\\end{aligned}\\]]and in which the vacuum initial condition @xmath23 is assumed .",
    "this equation represents a semiclassical approximation in the sense that the external background field is not quantized while the equation itself results from the quantization of the dirac field .",
    "note that , hereafter , a dot indicates a total time derivative .",
    "we also point out that @xmath19 involves a sum over both spin states , providing an overall factor two .",
    "the above formula is characterized by the transverse energy squared @xmath24 and the total energy squared @xmath25 ^ 2c^2 $ ] , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being the components of the canonical momentum perpendicular and parallel to the direction of the field , respectively .",
    "note that the four - potential of the external field @xmath28 is chosen in the temporal gauge [ @xmath29 so that @xmath30 .",
    "further comments are in order .",
    "firstly , the quantum vlasov equation [ eq .  ( [ vlasov ] ) ] does not take into account neither the collision between the created particles nor their inherent radiation fields . in the presence of a cef both phenomena are predicted to become relevant as the field strength @xmath2 reaches the critical scale of qed @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "so , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) is expected to be trustworthy in the subcritical regime @xmath32 where the number of produced pairs per unit of volume reads @xmath33with the shorthand notation @xmath34 .",
    "finally , we remark that , when the external field is oscillating in time with frequency @xmath35 and amplitude @xmath2 , the resulting @xmath36 should be much smaller than the maximum density @xmath37 that can be created from it , otherwise the external field model is no longer justified .",
    "quantum kinetic theory constitutes an appropriate approach for investigating the production of electron - positron pairs by a time - dependent electric field in low dimensional spacetimes .",
    "the corresponding quantum vlasov equations can be derived from the respective dirac equation in the field by applying a method similar to the one used in the determination of eq .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) [ for details , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "alternatively , a dimensional reduction @xmath38 kaluza - klein @xcite can be carried out on the @xmath15 quantities , particularly , on the coordinates perpendicular to the field .",
    "dimensional version of qed in which the electric field lies in the plane defined by the space - coordinates . ] by using the latter procedure , we obtain formalisms of different dimensionality .",
    "the first step allows us to describe the production of pairs in a minkowski space with @xmath0-dimensions @xmath39 . in order to show this",
    ", we take the dimension in excess @xmath40 to be curled up into a circle @xmath41 with a radius @xmath42 . in this context the motion of the dirac fermions is confined to the interval @xmath43 , and since the compactified coordinate is periodic and the electric field is homogeneous , one can fourier expand the dirac field in terms of the corresponding quantized momentum @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the exponentials involved in this expansion @xmath46 heavily oscillate as the limit @xmath47 is taken into account . in such circumstances , only the fundamental mode @xmath48corresponding to vanishing momentum  dominates .",
    "hence , once the momentum @xmath49 is locked up to a plane perpendicular to @xmath50 , the spontaneous production of electron - positron pairs driven by an oscillating electric field ( oef ) in a @xmath51dimensional spacetime is effectively described by eq .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) .",
    "however , unlike the case in @xmath15-dimensions , the single - particle distribution function in a @xmath0-dimensional spacetime does not involve a summation over the double - valued spin indices .",
    "we remark that the contribution of this sum is canceled out by dividing the resulting expression for @xmath19 by a factor @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the results which follow from this effective description will be valid as long as the typical energy involved in the problem is much below the characteristic scale @xmath53 . on the other hand , the expression for the number of produced pairs per unit of area in @xmath39 results from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tot - no ] ) by performing a transition to the discrete limit @xmath54 in which only the contribution of the vanishing mode must be considered .",
    "accordingly , @xmath55where @xmath56 refers to the single - particle distribution function @xmath19 divided by @xmath52 and with the momentum component @xmath57 having been set to zero .",
    "straightforward analyses , similar to those made in the previous case allow us to apply eq .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) when the production of pairs takes place in @xmath16-dimensions .",
    "in such a case , two spatial coordinates have to be compactified on a torus @xmath58 , which requires to set the respective components of the quantized momentum to zero as the characteristic radii of this manifold @xmath59 and @xmath42 vanish identically .",
    "then the asymptotic expression @xmath60 , resulting from the quantum vlasov equation  after dividing by @xmath52defines the linear density of created particle pairs @xmath61 .",
    "we apply the procedure described above by supposing the occurrence of the process in @xmath39 through a constant electric field [ @xmath62 .",
    "seeking for simplicity , we will take advantage of the known asymptotic expression for the single - particle distribution function in a four - dimensional spacetime @xmath63 $ ] @xcite .",
    "after compactifying the axis lying perpendicular to the external field and considering the fundamental contribution [ @xmath64 , we find that the rate of pp per unit area is @xmath65provided @xmath32 . a similar outcome results in @xmath16-dimensions .",
    "in this case we obtain that the asymptotic expression of the single - particle distribution function is momentum independent @xmath66 $ ] and the rate of yielded particle pairs per unit of length reads @xmath67 the rates presented in eq .",
    "( [ ratenumber21 ] ) and ( [ ratenumber11 ] ) coincide with those previously obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite by other methods .",
    "a comparison between both expressions reveals a clear dependence on the respective spacetime topology .",
    "we wish to apply the procedure described so far to the production of dirac fermions in a graphene layer .",
    "since this kind of layer approaches to a @xmath0-dimensional system , one could expect that the results previously derived are suited for such a purpose .",
    "however , inherent features of this material prevent us to proceed in a straightforward way . while some of these characteristics can be incorporated , there are other details which require certain attention . for instance , our previous expressions do not take into account effects resulting from finite temperatures .",
    "accordingly , it must be understood that their applicability will be trustworthy in the zero temperature limit .",
    "also , we will suppose that the electron - hole symmetry is preserved in this layer , a fact theoretically verified within the nearest - neighbours tight - binding model but no longer true as the next - to - nearest - neighbours interactions are considered @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous investigations @xcite , here and in the following the charge carriers will be considered with a tiny mass @xmath68 corresponding to the gap @xmath69 .",
    "in the numerical calculations in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] the specific value @xmath70 will be chosen for practical purposes ; such an energy gap can originate , e.g. , from the epitaxial growth of graphene on sic substrates @xcite . for comparison",
    "the energy gap @xmath71 will be considered in addition .",
    "we note that also other values of the energy gap can be induced in graphene @xcite .",
    "observe that , when adapting the @xmath0-dimensional version of eq .",
    "( [ vlasov ] ) , we have to take into account that  in graphene  the fermi velocity @xmath11 can not be exceeded .",
    "the inclusion of this constraint demands that one slightly modifies the quantum boltzmann - vlasov equations in @xmath39 , since it characterizes the instability of the vacuum where the created electrons and positrons might travel with velocities greater than @xmath72 but always smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "such modifications are carried out by replacing @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 so that the production of quasiparticle - hole pairs in graphene turns out to be governed by @xmath77\\nonumber\\\\&&\\qquad\\quad\\qquad\\times\\cos\\left[2\\int_{t^\\prime}^t dt^{\\prime\\prime}\\ \\mathpzc{w}_{\\pmb{p}}(t^{\\prime\\prime})\\right],\\end{aligned}\\]]where the function @xmath78 has been introduced . while @xmath79 is the transverse energy squared of the dirac fermions , @xmath80 ^ 2\\mathpzc{v}_f^2 $ ] is their respective total energy squared .",
    "further comments are in order .",
    "firstly , eq .",
    "( [ vlasovgraphene ] ) shows that the production of electron - hole pairs in graphene is a nonequilibrium phenomenon .",
    "observe that  as in qed ",
    "the combination of the nonlocality in time and the memory effects closely associated with the quantum statistic factor @xmath81 $ ] provides eq .",
    "( [ vlasovgraphene ] ) with a pronounced non - markovian feature @xcite .",
    "it means that the single - particle distribution function @xmath82 depends on the number of electron - hole pairs already present in the system .",
    "we remark that the spectral information encoded in eq .",
    "( [ vlasovgraphene ] ) will be valid in a vicinity of any of the two inequivalent points in the reciprocal space @xmath83 .",
    "accordingly , the momentum of the quasiparticles @xmath49 must be understood as relative to @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "it is , indeed , the previous restriction that does guarantee the relativistic - like behavior of the charge carriers .",
    "thus , in calculating the density of pairs per unit of area [ eq .",
    "( [ ratenumber21 ] ) ] the respective integral must be carried out over a surface limited by @xmath86 . as such",
    ", the existence of the two inequivalent dirac points , in combination with the spin degeneracy , leads to four kinds of quasiparticles .",
    "therefore , the total number density of produced particle pairs in graphene is @xmath87    the application of eq .",
    "( [ ngraphene ] ) to the case driven by a cef leads to an expression for @xmath88 that differs from the one which would result from eq .",
    "( [ ratenumber21 ] ) : @xmath89where @xmath90 is the critical field in graphene .",
    "for example , assuming an energy gap of @xmath70 , its value is @xmath91 .",
    "it may be seen as arising from the break down of the chiral symmetry through the mass @xmath68 .",
    "we note that this critical scale turns out to be much smaller than the critical scale of qed @xmath92 by eleven orders of magnitude .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ pairsingraphene ] ) can be understood as a `` saturation '' density of dirac - like particle pairs in graphene .",
    "it is reached when the interaction time with the external cef approaches @xmath93 . for larger interaction times , also particles with",
    "momenta exceeding @xmath94 are created which are not properly described by the dirac equation @xcite .",
    "finally , it must be understood that the effective boltzmann - vlasov equations describing the spontaneous creation of electron - hole pairs apply as long as the electric field satisfies the condition @xmath95 .",
    "as in the vacuum case , eq .  ( [ vlasovgraphene ] ) does not take into account neither the effects coming from the inherent radiation of the charge carriers nor the collisions between the created quasiparticles .",

    "accordingly , the curves for the massless case are rather flat , whereas the curves for massive dirac fermions exhibit a much stronger dependence on the applied electric field strength .    for the case of massive particles with @xmath126 , our numerical results for an oef and the analytical prediction for a cef lie quite close to each other at field strengths above @xmath170 v / cm .",
    "this may be understood by observing that the field oscillations are rather slow [ @xmath171 such that the oef locally resembles a cef .",
    "besides , the dimensionless intensity parameter @xmath172 is of order unity here [ @xmath173 corresponds to @xmath174 v / cm for the gap value chosen @xmath70 ] .",
    "contrary to that , for smaller field strengths below @xmath176 v / cm , the pair density produced by an oef is significantly larger than the cef outcome .",
    "the reason is that in an oef pairs can be generated both by the field amplitude but also by the time dependence of the field @xcite ; the latter channel is absent in a cef .",
    "accordingly , for @xmath177 , the creation mechanism by multiphoton absorption can become dominant , leading to enhanced pair creation in an oef as compared with a cef .    for the case of massless particles , our numerical results for an oef and the analytical prediction for a cef in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] run almost parallel .",
    "however , the cef outcome  which describes the saturation density in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ pairsingraphene])is larger by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "we argue that this is because the field oscillations can be considered as very fast in this case [ @xmath178 .",
    "hence , the effective field strength acting during the pair formation time is reduced by a corresponding temporal average , leading to the strong suppression observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "we point out that this behavior is different in a non - oscillating , sauter - like electric field whose pair creation efficiency of massless charge carriers in graphene approaches the cef result to within a factor of order unity @xcite .    for comparison ,",
    "[ fig:2 ] also shows our estimates for the number of massive pairs produced in graphene with a reduced gap of @xmath179 .",
    "as one might have expected , the number is significantly larger than in case of @xmath180 and approaches to the massless limit .",
    "we note that the critical field in the case presently under consideration only amounts to @xmath181 . since this turns out to be comparable with the values encompassed in the picture , the analytical expression associated with a constant electric field does not apply and the corresponding curve is not shown here .",
    "in summary , we have started by presenting the fundamental aspects associated with the production of pairs in a @xmath15-dimensional spacetime for the specific case in which the external gauge potential is independent of the space coordinates but oscillates in time . with the aim of investigating pp in low dimensional minkowski spaces ,",
    "dimensional compactifications have been carried out .",
    "the resulting effective theories verify that the production process in @xmath0- and @xmath16-dimensional spacetime is appropriately described by quantum - kinetic boltzmann - vlasov equations .",
    "we have applied the former outcome to the production of massive dirac fermions in graphene layers .",
    "the situation driven by an electric field oscillating in time has been investigated , which is characterized by a pronounced resonant behavior .",
    "the latter is reflected in the momentum distribution of created pairs .",
    "the total number density of massive pairs shows a strong dependence on the applied electric field strength which is mainly due to the schwinger - like exponential factor involving the critical field amplitude in graphene . its occurence is an important consequence of the massive quasiparticles in bandgap graphene layers , as compared with the massless charge carriers in ordinary gap - free graphene .",
    "differences between the pair densities obtained in oscillating and constant electric fields , respectively , could be traced back to the impact of the field oscillations .",
    "our numerical findings have shown that terahertz laser pulses  in combination with the substrate - induced bandgap technique for graphene  might provide a feasible scenario in which the creation of light quasiparticle - hole pairs could take place ; this way simulating the vacuum instability in qed . in connection , it remains an open question whether the production rate of massless quasiparticles in a single mode field can be comparable to the results associated with light massive dirac fermions when a weak beam of energetic photons is superimposed onto a strong but low - frequency electric field .",
