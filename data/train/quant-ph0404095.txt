    "the transverse modes of the optical field propagating in a waveguide with a parabolic refractive index profile are formally identical to quantum harmonic oscillator wave functions .",
    "some efforts have gone into researching on classical wave analogs of quantum mechanics , including analogs of fock states and measurement of wigner phase - space distributions for classical optical fields which can exhibit negative regions @xciteiaconis@xcite@xcite . however ,",
    "research on classical analogs has been limited principally to measurement of first order coherence , i.e. , single - particle states .",
    "classical - wave analogs of high order coherence ( quantum entanglement ) , i.e. , multiparticle states , have been seldom studied @xcite .",
    "the quantum entanglement , which describes nonlocal quantum correlation between different degrees of freedom especially separated particles , is regarded as the inherent feature of quantum theory chuang .",
    "the quantum correlation has been shown in the correlation measurement of the entangled state , and a criterion has been given by the violation of the bell inequality @xcite . in recent research ,",
    "the quantum entanglement is considered as a key property to realize the quantum computation @xcite and quantum teleportation @xcite , which makes the quantum entanglement strongly attracted to researchers .    in this paper",
    ", we will propose `` mode - entangled states '' based on the optical transverse modes of the optical field propagating in multimode waveguides .",
    "it is well - known that the quantum entanglement is the characteristic of the quantum theory with no classical analog .",
    "therefore , the `` mode - entangled states '' should be interpreted as the classical simulation of quantum entanglement using the optical transverse modes of the optical fields .",
    "the classical simulation will be discussed in detail , including the violation of the bell inequality and the correlation properties of optical pulses group delays . in @xcite , a full optical scheme to perform quantum computation",
    "is proposed , based on the optical transverse modes in multimode waveguides .",
    "the proposed c - not gate has the potential of being easily realized since it is based on optical waveguide technology and can be constructed by using mach - zehnder interferometer having semiconductor optical amplifiers ( soas ) in its arms .",
    "the soa can provide a very large kerr - like nonlinearity even at relatively low light intensities and can avoid the intensity attenuation excited by two - photon absorption @xcite .",
    "therefore soas have been used extensively as nonlinear elements in optical switching and wavelength - conversion devices @xcite .",
    "but whether the scheme would be capable of implementing the quantum computation depends on whether the c - not gate proposed in jianfu can generate the `` mode - entangled states '' . given all these",
    ", the research on the similarity between the `` mode - entangled states '' and the quantum entangled states may be important , for it not only provides a useful insight into fundamental features of quantum entanglement , but also yields new insights into quantum computation @xcite,@xcite and quantum communication .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secii ] , we will discuss the analogies between optical transverse modes in a multimode waveguide and quantum fock states . in section [ seciii ] ,",
    "the superposition of transverse modes in a random waveguide is analyzed . in section [ seciv ] , the bell inequality as a criterion of the existence of mode - entangled states",
    "is deduced . in section [ secv ] ,",
    "an analysis of the mode - entangled states in random waveguides and the correlation properties of group delays is discussed .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ secvi ] .",
    "considering a weakly guiding , symmetric slab waveguide , an optical field in the propagation direction , longitudinal @xmath0 direction , is restricted within the core region , which has the higher refractive index ( ri ) compared with that of the cladding . by using the fock - leontovich paraxial approximation , the maxwell equations for the monochromatic electric field component",
    "can be reduced to the equivalent schrodinger equation .",
    "the reduced field @xcite@xmath1satisfies the following equation@xmath2 \\psi = h\\psi   \\label{eq2}\\]]where @xmath3 is the monochromatic electric field component , the geometry of the waveguide is defined by the ri profile @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 being the wavelength in free space ) and @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , when the ri profile @xmath9 is parabolic , the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is similar to the schrodinger equation for a quantum harmonic oscillator . here , instead of plank s constant @xmath10",
    ", we have the vacuum light wavelength @xmath11 . and the variable @xmath12 plays the role of time .",
    "following @xcite , coordinate and momentum operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 , ( @xmath15 denote @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively ) can be introduced .",
    "these operators obey the standard commutation relations @xmath18",

    "when the optical field propagates in the waveguide that is @xmath0-invariant , in other words , the ri profile is uniform along @xmath0 , the propagation can be equivalently described in the time - independent schrodinger equation @xmath22where @xmath23 are a set of eigenmodes corresponding to a set of discrete eigenvalues @xmath24 .",
    "it leads to the expression of the monochromatic electric field component @xmath3 as follows @xmath25where the propagation constants @xmath26 are given as @xmath27as described in @xcite , such eigenmodes @xmath28 are similar to the quantum fock states . here",

    "it is well known that random perturbations of the geometry of multimode optical waveguides cause fluctuations of the average arrival time ( group delay ) and spread ( dispersion ) of optical pulse propagating in the waveguides @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcitegloge . in general , the information given for the description of optical field propagation in a random waveguide by means of the field @xmath36 in eq .",

    "the expectation value of any operator @xmath40 is given by the trace of the product of @xmath41 and @xmath40 : @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the utilization of the density matrix formalism seems to be useful for describing a superposition of modes in the random waveguide .",
    "in @xcite , a full optical method based on the transverse eigenmodes is proposed to perform the quantum computation , in which @xmath43 mode and @xmath44 mode in dual - mode waveguide are used as qubits to represent logical 0 and 1 . in this section , we will use the density matrix formalism in the analysis of superposition of these two modes ( @xmath45 mode and @xmath46 mode ) in a random waveguide .",

    "the coupling of te0 mode and te1 mode is similar to a two - level system .",
    "thus to describe this kind of coupling , we introduce the hamiltonian @xmath52where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the creation and the annihilation operators of the mode @xmath50 , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the creation and the annihilation operators of the mode @xmath57 . in the random waveguide , the random coupling among the guided modes will be caused by the perturbations in the waveguide geometry . here",

    "( [ eq16 ] ) , we can anticipate if @xmath77 , @xmath78 , which shows the evolution from the coherence ( pure state ) superposition to the incoherence ( mixed state ) superposition caused by the perturbation in the random waveguide .",
    "in order to distinguish between the coherence superposition and the incoherence superposition , we propose a scheme by analyzing the symmetries of the eigenmodes . in fig .",
    "1 , the profiles of the modes @xmath79 and @xmath80 are shown , where @xmath50 is symmetric and @xmath57 is antisymmetric .",
    "y - splitter is a device to split one light beam into two beams .",
    "if the perturbation of y - splitter s transition is slight ( i.e. the change of propagation constant @xmath81 ) , the splitter can split the beam with extremely low power loss .",
    "when @xmath79 and @xmath80 are launched in the y - splitter , @xmath79 is split into two symmetric parts , while @xmath65 is split into two antisymmetric parts @xcite .",
    "therefore , the output states of y - splitter s two branches are given explicitly by @xmath82when the input of y - splitter is given at a coherence superposition , @xmath83 , via expanding the input states in terms of the output states of the two branches of the splitter , we got @xmath84 , from which the intensities of two branches can be obtained @xmath85note that the phase @xmath86 of the input field @xmath87 will cause the variation of intensity in the y - splitter s two branches .",
    "when the input of y - splitter is given at an incoherence superposition , the relationship of the phase between the modes @xmath88 and @xmath89 is uncertain .",
    "the density matrix of the incoherence superposition is given as @xmath90where @xmath91 are the probabilities for the two modes @xmath92 and @xmath89 .",
    "then the output average intensities in two branches are @xmath93 .",
    "it shows that when the input is at the incoherence superposition , no matter how the phase of the input changes , the output intensities will stay invariable .",
    "that is the essence of our scheme of measuring the intensity difference between y - splitter s two branches to distinguish between the coherence superposition and the incoherence superposition .",
    "now , we apply the y - splitter to the analysis of the superposition state that is the evolution of a coherence superposition state after propagating in a random waveguide with distance of @xmath72 .",

    "it is already obvious that the perturbation in the waveguide geometry may cause the evolution from the coherence superposition to the incoherence superposition , namely decoherence , which leads to disappearance of the intensity difference between two outputs of the y - splitter .    by using beam propagation method ( bpm ) @xcite ,",
    "we calculate numerically the behavior of the mode superposition in the dual - waveguide when it is propagating in the phase controller and the y - splitter discussed above .",

    "as shown in @xcite , in the wigner distribution , the optical transverse modes are similar to quantum fock states .",
    "however , such similarities are confined to first order coherence ( such as single - particle ) . the higher order coherence ( such as multiparticle )",
    "is regarded as the inherent feature of quantum phenomena , which is nonlocal quantum correlation shown in the correlation measurement of the quantum entangled state .",
    "the criterion of the existence of the quantum entanglement is given by the violation of the bell inequality . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the correlation properties of the optical mode entanglement that is classical simulation of the quantum entanglement .",
    "we assume that a kind of `` mode - entangled states '' can be generated by means of some kind of interaction between the optical fields propagating in multimode waveguides ( e.g. the c - not gate proposed in @xcite ) .",

    "this correlation measurement can show that the two entangled fields are impartible to some extent .",
    "similar to quantum entanglement , the violation of the bell inequality is also used as the criterion of this impartibility .    to perform the correlation measurement of the bell inequality , a mode analyzer with a phase controller",
    "is required .",
    "the construction mentioned in the last section consisting of a phase controller and a y - splitter meets the requirements .",
    "following eq .",

    "3 , in which the mode - entangled state is generated via the c - not gate proposed in @xcite .",
    "the input of control field is given at the mode superposition @xmath115 and the input of target field is given at the mode @xmath92 or @xmath89 .",

    "( [ eq26 ] ) , the correlation of the analyzers can exhibit a maximum violation of the bell inequality @xmath130 .",
    "however the violation never occurs for the product state @xmath131 .",
    "we have simulated numerically the scheme shown in fig .",
    "3 by using bpm .",
    "the result is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 . due to the limitation of the simulation",
    ", we ca nt get the correlation of the control and the target fields .",
    "therefore , the experiment is necessary to validate whether there are mode - entangled states similar to quantum entangled states .",
    "as shown in section [ seciv ] , the bell inequality will be violated in the correlation measurement of a mode - entangled state .",
