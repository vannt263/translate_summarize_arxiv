    "this damping of the amplitude can be understood in the following way . in the high energy regime @xmath232 ,",

    "zero - mode gravitons with wavelength smaller than the bulk curvature scale can be interpreted as `` particles '' traveling in the five dimensions .",
    "these gravitons make a `` hard hit '' with the brane at the moment of this transition , and get large momenta in the fifth direction relative to the static brane . as a result",
    ", these gravitons escape into the bulk as kk gravitons , and thus the amplitude ( [ damped amplitude ] ) is damped . on the other hand , in our model the change of the hubble parameter is assumed to be small , and hence such violent emission of kk gravitons does not happen .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , the mapping rule @xmath241 will generally give a rather good estimate for the prediction of inflationary braneworld models as far as time variation of the hubble parameter is smooth .",

    "@xcite focusing on the power spectrum of gravitational waves .",
    "their method is basically the same that we have already explained in the main text .",
    "they considered the situation that de sitter inflation on the brane with constant hubble parameter @xmath231 suddenly terminates at a conformal time @xmath242 , and is followed by a minkowski phase .",
    "the power spectrum of gravitational waves is expressed in terms of the bogoliubov coefficients as @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath142 are the number of zero - mode gravitons created from initial zero - mode and kk modes , respectively . at super hubble scale ( @xmath144 )",
    "we can neglect the first term in the parentheses , which corresponds to the vacuum fluctuations in minkowski space .    according to @xcite , when @xmath245 ( i.e.",
    ", the wavelength of gravitational wave @xmath246 is much larger than the bulk curvature scale @xmath2 ) and @xmath144 , the coefficients are given by @xmath247 one can see that the contribution from initial kk modes is suppressed irrespective of the expansion rate @xmath248 .",
    "therefore the power spectrum is evaluated as @xmath249 equation  ( [ vf_ds->mink ] ) is half of the power spectrum on the de sitter brane ( eq .  ( [ p_5d ] ) ) , and this result can be understood as follows .",
    "the amplitude of fluctuations at the super hubble scale stays constant .",
    "after the sudden transition from the de sitter phase to the minkowski phase , the hubble scale becomes infinite .",
    "therefore , those fluctuation modes are now inside the hubble horizon , and they begin to oscillate . as a result ,",
    "the mean - square vacuum fluctuation becomes half of the initial value .    on the other hand , when @xmath250 and @xmath251 ( these conditions require @xmath232 ) , the bogoliubov coefficients are given by @xmath252 as before ,",
    "the contribution from initial kk modes is negligible , and that from @xmath244 dominates the power spectrum , @xmath253 one can see that the spectrum is suppressed by the factor @xmath254 .",
