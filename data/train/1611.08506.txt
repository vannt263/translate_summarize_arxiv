    "next , we give more examples of the computation of the qg ee for larger larger systems in various representations .",
    "we elaborate on the construction in the rsos case , detailing in particular the mapping between the rsos and loop model representations .",
    "finally we discuss the emergence of a @xmath223 term in the non - compact case .",
    "our definition of the ee relies on using a modified trace , known as a jones trace , in which a factor of the type @xmath224 is inserted under the usual trace symbol . to ensure that the resulting reduced density operator @xmath25 makes sense in the qg formalism",
    ", we must ensure that it commutes with the generators of @xmath28 .",
    "we therefore consider the xxz spin-@xmath75 chain , with boundary terms as described in the main text .",
    "the hamiltonian commutes with the following generators : s^z&=&_i _ i^z + s^+&=&_i q^_1^z ... q^_i-1^z_i^+ q^-_i+1^z ... q^-_m^z + s^-&=&_i q^_1^z ...",
    "q^_i-1^z_i^- q^-_i+1^z ... q^-_m^zsince the generators commute with the hamiltonian , they share the same right and left eigenvectors . as a consequence they commute with the density operator @xmath24 = 0,= .",
    "we split the spin chain in two parts @xmath2 , @xmath4 and define the reduced density operator @xmath25 using a jones trace over the part @xmath4 .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath2 is in the middle of the chain between @xmath225 and @xmath226 , so that @xmath227 and @xmath228 . thus _",
    "a=_b  q^2s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_r , s^z_b=_ib_i^z .",
    "let us check that the generators of @xmath229 on the subsystem @xmath2 commute with the reduced density operator @xmath25 .",
    "we have the following relations : s^z&=&s^z_b_l+s^z_a + s^z_b_r , + s^&=&s^_b_l q^-s^z_a - s^z_b_r+q^s^z_b_l s^_a q^-s^z_b_r + q^s^z_b_l+s^z_as^_b_r .",
    "consider first @xmath230 : s^z_a  _ a & = & _ b(s^z_aq^2s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_r ) + & = & _ b((s^z - s^z_b_l - s^z_b_r)q^2s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_r ) .",
    "obviously @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath230 and @xmath233 commute .",

    "we can now sum all terms and this proves @xmath234=0 $ ] .",
    "next we do the same for @xmath235 : s^+_a  _ a & = & _ b(s^+_a  q^2s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_r ) + & = & _ b((q^-s^z_b_l+s^z_b_rs^+-q^-s^z_a - s^z_b_ls^+_b_l + & & -q^s^z_a+s^z_b_rs^+_b_r)q^2s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_r ) + & & ( 1)-(2)-(3 ) .",
    "the first term @xmath236 of the right - hand side reads ( 1)&=&_b(q^-s^z_b_l+s^z_b_rs^+q^2s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_r ) + & = & _ b(q^2s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_rs^+q^-s^z_b_l+s^z_b_r)thanks to the cyclic permutation under the trace and the commutation of @xmath24 and @xmath237 .",
    "we then deal with the second term @xmath238 involving @xmath239 : ( 2)&=&_b(q^-s^z_a - s^z_b_ls^+_b_lq^2s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_r ) + & = & _ b(s^+_b_l q^-s^z_a q^s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_r ) + & = & _ b(q^-s^z+s^z_b_r+s^z_b_l q^s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_r s^+_b_l ) + & = & _ b(q^-s^z_b_r+s^z_b_l q^-s^z+s^z_b_l s^+_b_l ) + & = & _ b(q^-2s^z_b_r+2s^z_b_l s^+_b_lq^-s^z_a - s^z_b_l ) , thanks to cyclic permutations of the operators over the subsystem @xmath4 , the commutation of @xmath233 with @xmath24 and the commutation of @xmath231 with @xmath230 and @xmath232 .",
    "similarly for the term @xmath240 involving @xmath241 : ( 3)&=&_b(q^s^z_a+s^z_b_rs^+_b_rq^2s^z_b_l-2s^z_b_r ) + & = & _ b(q^-2s^z_b_r+2s^z_b_l s^+_b_rq^s^z_a+s^z_b_r ) . by regrouping the terms we find the desired property @xmath242 .",
    "a very similar computation can be done for @xmath243 .",
    "a meaningful ee must satisfy , at the very least , the symmetry property @xmath244 , meaning that subsystem @xmath2 is as entangled with @xmath4 , as @xmath4 with @xmath2 .",
    "we now show that this is the case for our qg ee .",

    "the proof is then simple and can be extended by analytic continuation to complex @xmath71 . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian is symmetric , and @xmath246 .",
    "we again divide our system in two pieces @xmath2 and @xmath4 with a cut in the middle ( for more complicated cuts the argument is similar ) and write the state in the following way : = _ i , j_i , j_a_b . the bases @xmath247 and @xmath248 can be chosen such that they have a well - defined magnetization . as a consequence ,",
    "since the groundstate @xmath7 is in the zero - magnetization sector , we can define those bases such that the matrix @xmath249 is block - diagonal and where each block corresponds to a sector of @xmath2 and @xmath4 with a well - defined magnetization .",

    "since the ground state is in the @xmath254 sector @xmath255 and thus the two reduced density operators have the same spectra and define the same entropy .",
    "this proves the statement @xmath76 in the case of a cut in the middle of the system .      to keep the discussion in the main text as simple as possible ,",
    "we have presented all explicit computations for a chain with just @xmath256 sites .",
    "this is of course no limitation to applying our general definitions , and accordingly we give here a few examples for higher values of @xmath36 .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath257 sites .",
    "the basis of link states is : = , = + the hamiltonian @xmath258 has the following ground state @xmath259 , where @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",

    "take the partial markov trace over the three last sites , we find the reduced density operator _ a=(^2n+2+n)=. this leads to @xmath262 , the same result as found in the main text for the ee of the first spin with @xmath256 .",
    "next we take @xmath2 as the first two sites , to compute the entanglement at the middle of the system .",
    "we trace the density operator over the two last sites : _ a & = & (  + ( ^2n+2 ) ) + & = & ( + ( ^2 n + 2 ) e_1 ) . we now need to take the logarithm of @xmath25 .",
    "we notice the identity @xmath263 , where @xmath264   \\draw[thick ] ( 1,1 . ) arc ( 0:-180:0.5 ) ;   \\draw[thick ] ( 1,-0.2 ) arc ( 0:180:0.5 ) ;   \\end{tikzpicture } } $ ] .",

    "[ s4sites ] we have verified that this expression coincides with the result obtained by using the modified trace in the vertex model",

    "it is hard to compute this final partial trace directly , since the form of @xmath267 will be substantially more complicated than ( [ logrhoalemma ] ) .",
    "a much more convenient option is to recall that gluing corresponding sites on top and bottom of any word in the tl algebra means technically to take the so - called markov trace @xmath268 .",
    "this in turn can be resolved as follows   = _ j [ 2j+1]_q _ v_j , [ markovtracedecomp ] where @xmath269 is the usual matrix trace over the ( standard ) module @xmath270 with @xmath271 defect lines , and @xmath272_q = \\tfrac{q^k - q^{-k}}{q - q^{-1}}$ ] are @xmath71-deformed numbers such that the loop weight @xmath273_q = q+q^{-1}$ ] .    in the simple @xmath257 case considered above",

    "there are two reasons for this :",
    "one is that at large @xmath3 the behavior is dominated by the region of @xmath404 small anyhow .",
    "the other is that we have , in fact , neglected all the contributions occurring from electric charges ( in the lattice derivation ) shifted by integers . accepting ( [ ncznint ] )",
