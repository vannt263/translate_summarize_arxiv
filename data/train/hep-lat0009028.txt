    "in minkowski spacetime , the feynman path integral has a complex integrand given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the minkowski action .",
    "on euclidean continuation of spacetime , the integrand becomes real , namely , @xmath3 .",
    "the positive definite euclidean action @xmath4 is ideally suited for monte carlo simulations based on the canonical ensemble .",
    "there is , however , a class of actions that are generically of the form @xmath5 in _ both _ minkowski and euclidean spacetime .",
    "these actions are of fundamental importance in physics , and we refer to them as complex actions . for example , all topological effects appear in the action in the form of complex actions .",
    "a chemical potential term renders the action complex .",
    "lattice qcd at finite temperatures and and densities has a complex action , and so do chiral gauge theories .",
    "complex actions appear in study of non - hermitian hamiltonians , complex langevin processes , random matrix models and so on .",
    "a complex valued action does not have any probabilistic interpretation , and hence , for example the metropolis algorithm is unsuitable .",
    "all attempts to numerically simulate complex actions for quantum field theories have met with formidable difficulties @xcite due to diverging errors arising from increasingly large volumes needed for obtaining the continuum limit . in particular , the conventional metropolis algorithm fails for complex actions due to large errors in simulating the expectation values of cosines and sines of extensive quantities .",
    "these expectation values are necessary due to the presence of the imaginary component in the action .",
    "there have been some studies that simulate complex actions using the langevin equation ; however , the results of these simulations can not be shown to converge to the required distribution @xcite .",
    "other methods @xcite also suffer from either a restriction to a very small lattice , or are not efficient or well defined .",
    "in our work , we work directly with the feynman path integral formulation of quantum field theory .",
    "we apply a generalized form of the microcanonical method to the case of complex actions .",
    "the microcanonical method has been very successful in simulating global quantities of real statistical systems @xcite .",
    "the microcanonical method yields a direct computation of the partition function ( up to a proportionality constant ) and hence the determination of its ( complex ) zeros .",
    "the zeros themselves contain useful information , in particular whether the system has critical points .",
    "the microcaconical simulation technique therefore offers an attractive alternative to the usual methods , based on the canonical ensemble , for determining the phase diagram of statistical systems .    in this paper",
    "we extend the microcanonical algorithm to complex actions , and , compute its partition function .",
    "in particular , we study the well known and highly nontrivial wess zumino witten ( wzw ) complex valued action functional . since this model exhibits many distinct phase transitions , we are able to provide a solid test of our algorithm .",
    "our simulations * predicts * the critical parameters , and we confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of our simulation by comparing the simulated results with the known analytical results .",
    "the wess zumino witten action in two - dimensional euclidean space has the following form @xmath6 where the chiral term is given by @xmath7 + and the imaginary piece comes from the wess zumino term @xmath8.\\ ] ] for the quantum field theory to be well defined , @xmath9 must be integer - valued .    for the case of @xmath10",
    ", the wess zumino term can be parametrized in terms of the euler angles @xcite , namely , @xmath11    as is well known , the wzw model has infinitely many critical points , one for each integer value for @xmath9 .",
    "the wzw model is conformally invariant at the critial coupling constants given by@xcite @xmath12    by extending the lee - yang theorem for zero s of the partition function to the complex case , we expect that the partition function , in the infinite volume limit , will be zero close to the critical coupling constants .",
    "we should be able to locate a zero ( close to the continuum model ) if the size of the lattice is large enough .    by calculating the simulated partition function as a function of @xmath9 ,",
    "the zeroes can be identified as the points of the @xmath9 axis where the partition function @xmath13 crosses over from a positive to a negative value .",
    "this cross over is a unique feature of complex actions , since the partition function of a real action can never be negative .",
    "given that only integer @xmath9 s are physical , the only physical zeros of @xmath13 are those that are close to integer values of @xmath9 .",
    "the partition function of the wess zumino witten action functional is given by @xmath14\\exp(-s_\\lambda)\\exp(iks_i),\\ ] ] which in turn can be cast into the form @xmath15 with the density of states given by @xmath16\\delta(e - s_i)\\exp(-s_\\lambda)}\\ ] ]    the density of states is estimated by a generalization of the microcanonical algorithm .",
    "first , the simulation space is broken up into energy bins of size @xmath17 .",
    "bin @xmath18 is taken to be the reference bin .",
    "the system is thermalized by randomly generating configurations and accepting only those configurations whose values of @xmath19 fall within the first two bins .",
    "the density of states @xmath20 is estimated by calculating the occupation number ratio between the two bins .",
    "the updating of configurations and crediting of counts to the bins are based on a _ combination _ of the microcanonical and canonical ensembles .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "[ one ]    1 .",
    "a new configuration is generated , and its acceptance is weighted by the usual metropolis factor @xmath21 .",
    "note that since the chiral contribution , being real , plays the role of a weighting action , the value of @xmath22 has to be at the * critical value * for a particular level ; otherwise , if @xmath23 , the system would never go critical .",
    "the updated configuration is accepted only if it s @xmath19 value falls within the two bins . if this is so , the counter for the bin where @xmath19 lands is credited .",
    "if the updated configuration does not satisfy the above criterion , a count will still be credited to the bin of the * old * configuration .    by",
    "continuing this process across all the energy bins allows us to get an estimation of the density of states . a crucial point in going from one set of bins to another is to have , in between , at least one overlapping bin for the purpose of normalizing the occupation number of the various bins .",
    "all of the results quoted are for simulations for a @xmath0 lattice , as this size is sufficient for accurately estimating the value of critical @xmath9 . in our work",
    ", we tested our simulations for two levels , namely @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "for the critical coupling @xmath26 was set to be 0.2 while a finer value of 0.1 was chosen for @xmath27 .",
    "a total number of about 1 million configurations were generated for every set of energy bins .",
    "the energy bin was terminated when the resulting density of state is less than 3 decimal places ( which is the achieved level of accuracy in our simulations ) .",
    "the results for the simulated density of states is shown in figure [ one ] .",
    "since @xmath28 , it is only necessary to perform the simulation for @xmath29 .",
    "this reflection symmetry ensures that the wzw partition function is real , since it simplifies to @xmath30 the simulated value for integrand of @xmath31 is given in figures [ twoa ] and [ twob ] .",
    "the plot of @xmath31 against @xmath9 is physical relevant only for integer @xmath9 s .",
    "we expect that @xmath32 at the value of @xmath9 that corresponds to @xmath33 ; for other values of integer @xmath9 , @xmath13 is physical and contains information on how the theory behaves away from criticality .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath13 near its zero is given in figures [ threea ] and [ threeb ] . by scanning for zeros of the simulated partition function z",
    "that are close to integers , we find that : @xmath34 and @xmath35 the errors were deduced from the standard deviation computed from two separate sets of results for each coupling .",
    "the exact values are @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , and we see that we have obtained a result of fairly high accuracy with a surprisingly small lattice .",
    "our simulations of the wess zumino witten action demonstrates that the microcanonical method is in principle capable of simulating complex actions . unlike the case of real actions , however , there are several subtleties involved .",
    "chief among them are the following .    1 .",
    "a high degree of accuracy is required in order to achieve stable and consistent results .",
    "the reason being that , unlike real actions , terms in the complex action partition function * cancel * each other ( see the graphs of figures [ twoa ] and [ twob ] ) , leaving behind a small value in the region where the phase transitions take place .",
    "the fact that the critical point can be made to move from @xmath24 to @xmath25 by changing the value of @xmath36 in the weighting function is strong evidence that our simulation is giving the correct result .",
    "there are infinitely many critical points of the wzw model , one for each integer @xmath9 , and in principal , all these critical points can be obtained by our simulation .",
    "3 .   there is an additional necessity of having to provide a good resolution of the @xmath37 term .",
    "typically , this means that there should be at least a few points within each trigonometrical quadrant .",
    "consequently , since @xmath38 , a smaller energy spacing is required for larger couplings .",
    "computational time therefore is expected to increase as coupling @xmath9 increases .",
    "4 .   since the cosine of an argument can not be taken as a reliable weight in any monte carlo simulation , the contribution to the weight must always come from the real action .",
    "this constraint demands that the coupling @xmath22 in the real action has to be fixed at its critical value @xmath36 .",
    "in other words , it is not possible to fix the coupling in the imaginary component , namely @xmath9 , and deduce the critical coupling @xmath36 of the real action .",
    "our method is ideally suited for studying the critical properties of extended systems . in particular , d - branes in the wzw model are non - local background configurations that respect the conformal invariance of the theory @xcite . our method , for example , can numerically study under what circumstances a d - brane background in the wzw model results in a conformally invariant system .    in conclusion",
    ", we believe that the ability of the microcanonical technique to get accurate predictions from the wess zumino witten action is a major step forward in the simulation of complex actions , and opens the way for numerically studying other complex actions , as well as extended objects such as d - branes .",
