    "the onsager reaction field ( orf ) theory@xcite is an improved form of mean - field theory that includes at least partially the effects of correlations between nearby atoms . it was originally applied in magnetism by brout and thomas,@xcite and more recently to spin glasses,@xcite itinerant electron systems,@xcite hubbard models,@xcite and anisotropic heisenberg@xcite and xy@xcite models .",
    "the procedure is versatile and has been used to estimate specific heat , susceptibility and correlations above the critical temperature , @xmath0 , as well as @xmath0 itself . a clear review of the orf method applied to three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising models is given by white.@xcite the method has been applied on the standard bravais lattices , including simple cubic ( sc ) , body - centered - cubic ( bcc ) , and face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) , with results given in terms of integrals over the associated brillouin zone ( bz ) . however , a modification of these calculations is needed to consider other lattices which are not in the bravais classification . here",
    "we show how to apply the orf procedure to any non - bravais lattice that can be considered as an underlying bravais lattice with a basis . in particular ,",
    "the diamond and hexagonal close packed lattices are analyzed , both of which have two - atom bases .    in the usual mean - field theory due to weiss,@xcite a chosen atom ( or spin , for the magnetic problems we consider ) is viewed as interacting with the average , or mean - field , of its nearest neighbors .",
    "the exact hamiltonian is replaced by the mean - field one , in which the neighbors are introduced as the mean - field acting on the central atom .",
    "however , the central atom itself influences the neighbors , and therefore the mean - field usually includes a part directly attributed to the central atom .",
    "this means the mean - field includes a part that might be considered a self - interaction effect , which should really be subtracted out .",
    "this results in an overestimate of the critical temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "the orf procedure is simply a way to estimate and subtract out this self - interaction part , i.e. , by adding a `` reaction field '' term that accomplishes this . in this way ,",
    "the estimate of @xmath0 is brought down , indeed , usually orf leads to an underestimate of @xmath0 .",
    "the standard orf approach uses as input the specific lattice structure , be it sc , fcc , bcc , etc .",
    "however , the usual approach and well - known formulas require the perfect periodicity of a bravais lattice  all atoms are taken as equivalent .",
    "on the other hand , we have been interested in mean - field and other calculations@xcite for diamond lattices because of the low coordination number ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the diamond lattice is not a bravais lattice ",
    "all sites do not have the same surroundings , instead , the diamond lattice can be considered to be a fcc lattice with a two atom basis .",
    "thus it is interesting to understand how to apply the orf procedure to such a system .",
    "recently there is interest in ferromagnetic ordering of hcp @xmath2he at low temperatures,@xcite assumed to be described by a heisenberg model .",
    "the hcp lattice is another example of a non - bravais lattice ; it can be considered as simple hexagonal ( stacked triangular nets ) also with a two - atom basis . here",
    "we show how to extend the standard orf calculation of @xmath0 to these two systems , however , our approach will apply to any bravais lattice with a basis , i.e. , any system with multiple atoms per unit cell .    for simplicity we display formulas for ising models on a 3d lattice with spins @xmath3 and coordination number @xmath4 .",
    "however , the modifications to treat @xmath5-component spins [ i.e. , xy ( n=2 ) , heisenberg ( n=3 ) , etc . ] are minimal and will be noted where they are appropriate .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath6 where each sum is over all of the lattice sites , and the bond coupling strength @xmath7 depends only on the neighbor displacement , @xmath8 , and is of the same strength @xmath9 for all near neighbor pairs .",
    "@xmath10 is a spatially varying applied field .",
    "in the orf calculation ( see ref .   for more details ) , a spin at a chosen site interacts with the mean - field reduced by a `` reaction field '' that depends on the spin at that site.@xcite for completeness we summarize key aspects of this calculation here to see how the extension to a non - bravais lattice is accomplished . to effect",
    "the reaction term , in the real space hamiltonian an extra self - interaction term is added : @xmath11 this is equivalently a delta - function exchange term of strength @xmath12 .",
    "the constant @xmath12 is the reaction - field , which is determined self - consistently in the calculation , by a constraint on the magnetic susceptibility , below .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath13 , transformed into wavevector space is , @xmath14\\ ] ] where the fourier - space quantities derive from @xmath15 @xmath16 together with a similar definition for the field @xmath17 , for real applied field @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath18 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "[ hamil - q ] is over all @xmath19 in the appropriate brilluoin zone .",
    "the fourier - transformed exchange interaction is @xmath20 i.e. , a sum over displacements to nearest neighbors , @xmath21 .",
    "the q - dependent magnetization and zero - field susceptibility have the usual definitions ,    @xmath22    @xmath23    then for an arbitrary hamiltonian , there results the constraint ( used to determine the reaction field @xmath12 ) @xmath24 the number of spin components @xmath5 enters here , in the expression for @xmath25 , when models other than the ising model are considered .    now we consider the mean - field approximation in q - space , i.e. , using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , magnetization components at different wavevectors are assumed to be independent .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian for the interaction of a negative q - component can be written @xmath26 where the effective ( or mean - field ) magnetic field is @xmath27 from the definition ( [ susc ] ) , and the relation , @xmath28 the mean - field hamiltonian gives the well - known expression , @xmath29 the reaction field @xmath12 is determined by forcing this expression for @xmath30 to satisfy the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath0 is determined as the temperature at which @xmath31 diverges . for lower temperatures",
    "the orf calculation gives a negative susceptibility at @xmath32 , signifying the presence of the ordered state . in a continuum limit of the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) , a short manipulation leads to an expression for the critical temperature , @xmath33 the constant @xmath34 is given from a q - space integral over the appropriate brilluoin zone : @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the specific volume per lattice site ( for example , @xmath37 for sc , bcc and fcc lattices , respectively , where @xmath38 is the cubic unit cell volume ) , at @xmath32 we have @xmath39 , which gives the energy scale in the mean - field approximation .",
    "then the dimensionless integral @xmath34 gives the correction to the mean - field critical temperature . from integration over the appropriate brilluoin zones , the values of @xmath34",
    "are @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for sc , bcc and fcc lattices , respectively . when applied to the 3d ising model ( @xmath43 ) one gets@xcite @xmath44 for sc , bcc and fcc lattices , considerable improvements over the standard mean - field results given from @xmath45 .",
    "they compare favorably with the exact ising model results@xcite from series : @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "for the heisenberg model ( @xmath47 ) , the orf predictions would be @xmath48 , for sc and bcc lattices , whereas precise monte carlo estimates@xcite give @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "note , however , that the orf estimates are all below the exact results .",
    "now suppose the lattice has an underlying set of @xmath18 bravais lattice points @xmath50 , each of which has a two - atom basis @xmath51 .",
    "( the generalization to a larger basis is straightforward . ) therefore at each site @xmath50 we suppose there is a two component field @xmath52 written as a column vector : @xmath53 it is useful to employ a sublattice notation , @xmath54 . the exchange interaction occurs between neighboring bravais sites , via a @xmath55 matrix , @xmath56 : @xmath57 where it is stressed that the sums are over all bravais sites ; the factor of @xmath58 avoids double counting , and @xmath59 in fact , the matrix @xmath56 is taken as zero unless @xmath8 is a near neighbor displacement .",
    "the details of the specific lattice will determine which components of @xmath60 are nonzero .",
    "the reaction terms , two for each site @xmath50 , can be written with a @xmath61 unit matrix , @xmath62   \\cdot w_{\\bf m}\\ ] ] which is equivalent to expression ( [ react ] ) , and essentially shifts the original exchange matrix by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the @xmath61 unit matrix .",
    "finally , for the purpose of the calculation , there is a separate applied field for each sublattice , so at a given site @xmath50 , we have fields @xmath65 ( acting on @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 ( acting on @xmath68 ) .",
    "these compose a column vector field , @xmath69 then we choose to write the q - space hamiltonian , including the reaction term and applied fields , as @xmath70\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fourier transforms needed here obviously are related to those already defined for @xmath71 , @xmath66 , etc . the most significant difference from eq .",
    "( [ hamil - q ] ) is the presence of `` 2 '' on @xmath12 , due to the two - atom basis .",
    "this hamiltonian is exact .",
    "now we define the sublattice magnetizations ( where @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 and related susceptibilities ( where also @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 in the rpa , from the point of view of the negative q - components , the hamiltonian is approximated as @xmath76\\ ] ] where we use the shorthand notation for the shifted exchange interaction , @xmath77 the above hamiltonian can alternatively be written in terms of effective fields in components , @xmath78\\ ] ]    @xmath79    @xmath80    then in the limit of zero applied field , using this rpa hamiltonian , the susceptibility definitions ( [ chi - ij ] ) become @xmath81 and we get equations for the susceptibility components ,    [ chi - comp ] @xmath82\\ ] ] @xmath83\\ ] ] @xmath84\\ ] ] @xmath85\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 means the expectation value using the rpa hamiltonian . in the high - temperature limit , these expectations are @xmath87 the equations ( [ chi - comp ] ) can be solved in the general case for all four susceptibility components .",
    "we get    @xmath88    @xmath89    and similar equations for @xmath90 and @xmath91 by appropriately interchanging the ab indeces . for the lattices considered in this paper ,",
    "however , there are the symmetries , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "therefore the solutions are seen to satisfy symmetries @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "now consider how to determine the reaction field @xmath12 , and subsequently , @xmath0 . a little consideration using the definitions of @xmath96 and @xmath97 shows that there is still the constraint , @xmath98 converting to the continuum limit , @xmath99 this equation implicitly determines the reaction coupling @xmath12 for any @xmath100 .",
    "it is not clear how to get an explicit solution for @xmath12 from it ; a solution for @xmath101 for a given lattice can be found numerically ( below ) .",
    "now , just as described for the bravais lattice systems , the critical temperature @xmath0 is the temperature at which any of the susceptibility components , at @xmath32 , diverges .",
    "( the @xmath102 are well defined on the high temperature side of @xmath0 . )",
    "so @xmath0 is determined as the point at which the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ chi - aa ] ) goes to zero , leading to a relation between the critical temperature ( via @xmath25 ) and the critical reaction field , @xmath103 using this in the constraint equation ( [ continuum ] ) together with the result ( [ chi - aa ] ) for @xmath96 , gives the general result when the symmetry @xmath104 holds ,    [ tc - general ] @xmath105 @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the effective @xmath108 exchange strength , @xmath109 the integral @xmath34 defined in this way again gives the correction to the mean - field prediction for @xmath0 .",
    "thus the determination of @xmath0 has been reduced to evaluating this integral over the brilluoin zone .    below we will use eq .",
    "( [ tc - general ] ) to estimate the critical temperature for diamond and hcp lattices .",
    "but first we can verify that the result is correct by using it for a bcc lattice , considered as a simple - cubic lattice with a basis , where we already know the standard orf result for @xmath0 .",
    "the bcc lattice points can be generated from the simple cubic primitive vectors , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the cubic cell lattice constant , together with the basis , @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the displacement to the body - centered point .",
    "the lattice can be thought of as a pair of interpenetrating sc lattices ( a , b sublattices ) with displacement @xmath116 .",
    "the near neighbors of an ` a ' site are all ` b ' sites , and vice - versa , with the result that the @xmath117 and @xmath118 couplings are all zero .",
    "the nonzero @xmath119 couplings depend only on the near neighbor displacement , @xmath21 , as follows :    @xmath120    @xmath121    where the terms for @xmath122 correspond to the coupling within the two - atom basis .",
    "the fact that @xmath123 simplifies the determination of @xmath0 considerably , as we only need to know the product , @xmath124 .",
    "the fourier - transformed interactions are found from sums over all the nonzero @xmath125 ( 15 possible terms ) : @xmath126 @xmath127 in this and the following equations , @xmath128 are in units of @xmath129 . for the underlying sc lattice ,",
    "the density of points is 1 for every volume @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath130 . after a short calculation , there results @xmath131 and the determination of @xmath0 relies on evaluation of the simplified integral , @xmath132 where @xmath133 and the factor @xmath134 was absorbed into the dimensionless @xmath135 .",
    "@xmath136 \\bigr\\}^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral @xmath34 was evaluated numerically by sampling @xmath128 uniformly with a constant increment , and then using an extrapolation of the results in the limit that the increment goes to zero . essentially , we let @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is some integer number of divisions of the axes , and then generated a simple cubic lattice of sampling points from these .",
    "the integral @xmath34 was then estimated as a sum over the resulting cubic grid of sampling points in the bz in q - space . a plot of @xmath34 versus @xmath139 results in a straight line whose extrapolation to @xmath140 gives a very accurate estimate of the integral .",
    "( errors in the integral estimate clearly go as @xmath139 . ) in this way we found @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , the estimate of critical temperature for the bcc system obtained viewing it as sc with a basis is @xmath142 for comparison with the standard orf procedure , when the original bcc lattice is used , the specific volume is @xmath143 .",
    "the fourier transformed exchange ( eq .  [ jq ] ) is @xmath144 the integral needed for eq .",
    "( [ tc - general ] ) is @xmath145 where the integral is over the brilluoin zone for the bcc lattice ( an fcc wigner - seitz cell ) , and was evaluated by the sampling technique already described .",
    "the integral is exactly twice that given by expression ( [ i - sc ] ) , but because @xmath143 is half as large for the bcc lattice as for the sc lattice , the result for @xmath0 from eq .",
    "( [ tc - general ] ) is that given by eq .",
    "( [ tc - bcc ] ) .",
    "thus this approach using the two - atom basis , for the bcc system , is equivalent to the standard orf procedure , and should be reliable for application to the diamond and hcp lattices .    as an interesting mathematical note , the integral @xmath34 in ( [ i - bcc ] )",
    "can be rewritten using the periodicity and symmetry in q - space to be over the same region as in ( [ i - sc ] ) .",
    "a cubic cell @xmath146 , contains 4 copies of the brilluoin zone of the bcc lattice .",
    "thus we can integrate over this cubic cell and divide by 4 ; also , shifting the variables of integration to @xmath147 , etc .",
    ", leads to an additional factor of @xmath148 and gives @xmath149 overall , the prefactor on the integral is one .",
    "thus the integral here must be the same as the integral in ( [ i - sc ] ) .",
    "the integrands , however , are not equivalent ; there is no way to transform one into the other .",
    "finally we also note that it is easier and more precise to evaluate ( [ i - bcc - prime ] ) by a uniform cubic grid of sampling points than expression ( [ i - bcc ] ) , because a cubic grid of sampling points easily fits to the cubic integration boundaries . on the other hand , for expression ( [ i - bcc ] ) , there is always more difficulty to fit any grid of points smoothly to _ all _ of the integration boundaries of the fcc wigner - seitz cell in q - space , leading to greater discretization errors .",
    "removing these errors is important for producing a smooth extrapolation to @xmath150 .",
    "the diamond lattice can be considered as an fcc lattice with a two atom basis . the fcc primitive vectors are @xmath151 , where @xmath113 is the standard cubic cell lattice constant , and the basis is @xmath114 , where @xmath152 .",

    "clearly we also have once again , @xmath163 .",

    "the easiest and most precise way to evaluate this integral is to apply the same procedure we noted for the bcc system : change the integration region to the cube , @xmath167 , which contains 2 copies of the bz , therefore include a factor of @xmath168 , and sum over points on a cubic grid .",

    "[ i - diamond ] ) , and its extrapolation to @xmath140 gives @xmath172 .",
    "thus the critical temperature is estimated as @xmath173 the exact result for @xmath0 ( ising model , @xmath43 ) as estimated from series expansions , is known to be @xmath174 . thus the orf calculation , as is usual , underestimates @xmath0 but is a considerable improvement over the simple mean - field result , @xmath175 .",
    "another example of a lattice with a basis is the hcp system , which can be considered as interpenetrating simple hexagonal bravais lattices@xcite ( i.e. , stacked triangular nets ) .",
    "the primitive vectors of the simple hexagonal bravais lattice can be taken as @xmath176 , where @xmath113 and @xmath177 are the lattice constants .",

    "the highest density packing is obtained , however , for the calculation here this ratio does not directly enter , and need not be specified .",
    "instead , it is interesting to consider that the near neighbor exchange interactions within the triangular nets ( xy - plane ) have one strength , @xmath180 , while there is a different strength , @xmath181 , for the bonds between the planes . in general",

    "it is surprising to see that at @xmath206 alder found the correction to the mean - field @xmath0 to be by the factor @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is a certain sum over the brillouin zone . making a more accurate evaluation of @xmath227 by the techniques described here , we get @xmath228 , i.e. , a value exactly equal to the correction integral @xmath34 obtained from the orf procedure.@xcite in fact , it is easy to show that the expression for @xmath227 given by adler is exactly equivalent to our expression ( [ i_hcp ] ) for @xmath34 , including the anisotropic case , @xmath229 . therefore ,",
    "the green s function approach used there is exactly equivalent to the orf procedure presented here ; they are different approaches to impose the random phase approximation .",
    "furthermore , in this level of approximation , the question posed by domb and sykes@xcite and investigated by adler is answered : @xmath0 for fcc and hcp ising models are the same , even though the hcp lattice is more densely packed and might be expected to have a higher @xmath0 .",
    "apparently a more precise procedure is needed to determine whether there is a true difference in their critical temperatures .",
    "it is clear that any quantities such as specific heat , magnetization , etc , can be evaluated via the rpa hamiltonian for temperatures away from @xmath0 , provided that the reaction field , @xmath12 , has been determined .",
    "thus we take a few sentences to examine how @xmath12 can be calculated .    at the critical temperature , the reaction field as determined from eq .",
    "( [ lam - crit ] ) is seen to be @xmath230 for higher temperatures , the constraining equation ( [ continuum ] ) to determine @xmath12 is equivalent to @xmath231 ^ 2            - \\chi_{0}^2 g_{\\bf q}^{ab}g_{\\bf q}^{ba } } = 1\\ ] ] considering the left hand side as a function of @xmath12 , one can apply newton s method to search for the @xmath12 at which the function passes through 1 .",
    "this search can be aided by the requirement that the denominator of this integrand must be positive everywhere in the bz , including at @xmath232 .",
    "this leads to the inequality for @xmath100 , @xmath233 indeed , we have found as well that @xmath234 .",
    "results for @xmath101 for the diamond lattice and hcp lattice ( at @xmath206 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - lambda ] . the hcp lattice , which has higher coordination number , also has the stronger reaction field at @xmath0 . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the reaction fields diminish and become of comparable sizes for @xmath235 .",
    "it is also expected that the slope relates to the specific heat.@xcite the graph then reasonably demonstrates a larger specific heat for hcp compared to diamond near @xmath0 , in contrast to more similar specific heats at higher temperatures .",
    "we have reviewed the standard onsager reaction field approximation for estimating @xmath0 , and have shown how it can be extended to apply to a bravais lattice with a basis .",
    "the bcc lattice was used as a test case because it can be calculated either by the standard approach or the new method , when considered as sc with a two - atom basis .",
    "we used the new method to get @xmath0 for diamond and anisotropic hcp lattice systems , however , it certainly can be extended to more complex systems with a greater number of atoms per unit cell . for the hcp lattice system , the orf procedure used here was found to be exactly equivalent to a green s function ( plus rpa ) approach used by adler.@xcite while it is an approximate method , it does give reasonable estimates of @xmath0 and other quantities where other methods may be more cumbersome or time - consuming to apply .",
