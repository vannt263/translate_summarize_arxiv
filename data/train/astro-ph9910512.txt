    "the cat ( cherenkov array at thmis ) telescope records cherenkov flashes due to vhe atmospheric showers through its 17.8m@xmath1 mirror .",
    "the fine grain of its camera , combined with fast electronics , allows a relatively low @xmath0-ray detection threshold energy of @xmath2 ( at zenith ) as well as an accurate analysis of the resulting images .",
    "the experiment is fully described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the analysis method is based on the fit of each individual shower image with theoretical mean @xmath0-ray images coming from a semi - analytical model  @xcite .",
    "this permits the extraction of a @xmath0-ray signal from the background due to cosmic - ray induced atmospheric showers ; the optimization of the event selection using the crab nebula data gives a hadron - rejection factor of @xmath3200 for a @xmath0-ray efficiency of @xmath340% .",
    "the fit also yields the energy of each shower in the @xmath0 hypothesis , with a resolution of @xmath320% , independent of energy , when restricting to showers with a small impact parameter ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , the spectrum reconstruction procedure presented below involves the exact energy - resolution function @xmath5   and _ real _ energy @xmath6 , to get an _ estimated _ energy @xmath7 . ] in order to use the entire available statistics .",
    "these functions have been determined by detailed monte - carlo simulations of the telescope response , as has the effective detection area @xmath8 , which includes the effect of event - selection efficiency .",
    "the simulations have been checked and calibrated on the basis of several observables by using muons rings and the nearly - pure @xmath0-ray signal from the highest flare of mrk  501 in 1997  @xcite .",
    "+ with typical statistics of @xmath31000 @xmath0-ray events and a signal - to - background ratio of @xmath9 ( as obtained on the crab nebula ) , a spectrum can be determined with reasonable accuracy as follows .",
    "first we define a set @xmath10\\}_{i_{e}=1,n_e}$ ] of energy bins ; since the threshold energy of the telescope increases with zenith angle , each of these is divided into a subset @xmath11\\}_{i_{z}=1,n_z(i_{e})}$ ] of zenith angle bins   bin corresponds to the transit of the source . ] with a width of @xmath12 .",
    "then , for all on and off - source runs  30min , off - source runs being used to estimate the hadronic background . ] , the number of events passing the selection cuts is determined within each @xmath13 2d - bin . finally , assuming a given spectral shape , a maximum - likelihood estimation of the spectral parameters is performed , which takes into account the effective detection area and the energy - resolution function . at this stage , two hypotheses @xmath14 and @xmath15 are successively considered , which are a simple power law @xmath16 and a curved shape @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "power laws often account for spectral properties in high energy astrophysics , at least because they often constitute a good approximation when considered over a restricted energy range . on the other hand ,",
    "a curved shape is suggested by general considerations on emission processes within blazar jets ( see the next sections ) ; the latter parametrization , previously used by the whipple group @xcite , corresponds to a parabolic law in a @xmath18 _ vs. _ @xmath19 representation and allows simple comparisons .",
    "the relevance of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath15 is estimated through the likelihood ratio of the two hypotheses , which is defined as @xmath20 : it behaves ( asymptotically ) like a @xmath21 with one d.o.f . and permits a search for the presence of spectral curvature . _",
    "all spectral curves shown in the next sections come from the best set of fitted parameters obtained by this procedure .",
    "it is also customary to superimpose on them `` experimental '' points @xmath22 , which are only indicative of the statistics used in each @xmath23 energy bin_. the definition of these points is the following : if we note @xmath24 as the best fitted spectrum under the hypothesis @xmath25 or @xmath26 according to @xmath27 , @xmath28 as the number of @xmath0-ray events observed in the @xmath13 2d - bin , and @xmath29 as its error , and @xmath30 as the corresponding predicted number , then @xmath31 is the unique energy within the bin for which @xmath32 holds   or @xmath19 in a @xmath33 or in a @xmath34 ) representation , respectively . ] , and @xmath35 /   \\displaystyle\\left[\\sum_{i_{z}=1}^{n_z(i_{e } ) } 1/{\\sigma}_{i_{e},i_{z}}^{2}\\right]$ ] .",
    "it should be noted that this way of representing spectra can not replace the likelihood method , which provides the only relevant physical results , i.e. the values of the most probable spectral parameters as well as their errors and covariance matrix . _ in particular , one should not use the @xmath36 points in any kind of minimization , since the @xmath29 are correlated in a very complex manner . _",
    "mrk  501 exhibited a remarkable series of flares during the whole year 1997 , going down to a much lower mean flux in 1998 ( fig .",
    "[ 501cl3nfn]a ) .",
    "the detailed spectral analysis of the 1997 data can be found in  @xcite ; here we extend it to the 1998 results .",
    "+    the vhe spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of mrk  501 , derived for different flaring - activity states in 1997 ( fig .  [ 501cl3nfn]b ) , shows a significant curvature which is now well confirmed by different ground - based experiments  @xcite .",
    "the peak @xmath0-energy is found to lie just above the cat threshold , and it seems to shift towards higher energies as the flux increases . to check this spectral variability by a more robust method , the hardness ratio has been computed for five different - level intensities : the correlation observed in fig .  [ 501hrbeppo]a confirms the hardening of the vhe sed during flaring periods . fig .",
    "[ 501hrbeppo]b shows the broad - band sed of mrk  501 for two flaring dates in april 1997 : it exhibits the two - bump structure typical of blazars , with a dip indicated by the contemporary egret upper - limit point in the gev energy range  @xcite .",
    "the obvious correlation of the x - ray emission from bepposax data  @xcite with tev emission strongly suggests that the same particle population is responsible for emission in both energy - ranges , i.e. it supports the picture given by leptonic models  @xcite , in which an energetic electron beam propagating in the magnetized plasma jet produces x - rays through synchrotron radiation as well as vhe @xmath0-rays through inverse compton scattering of low - energy photons .",
    "+ unlike the 1997 spectra , the spectrum of mrk  501 in 1998 does not show any curvature ( fig .",
    "[ 501sp98]a ) , indicating a vhe peak energy well below the cat threshold at that time .",
    "[ 501sp98]b confirms in particular that , in spite of larger statistical errors , the 1998 data can not be fitted by the average spectrum shape found in 1997 ( av data set , see table  [ tabsummary ] ) , as would be expected in the absence of any spectral variability . with a mean flux",
    "much lower than that of 1997 , the power - law shape found in 1998 is therefore consistent with the previously suggested scenario , in which the peak @xmath0-energy seems to be correlated with the vhe flux .      as reported in  @xcite ,",
    "mrk  421 is the second extragalactic source detected by cat : almost quiet in 1996 - 97 , the source showed small bursts in 1997 - 98 , together with a higher mean activity ( fig .",
    "[ 421clsp]a ) .",
    "the energy spectrum derived for the 1998 flaring periods is well represented by a simple power law ( fig .",
    "[ 421clsp]b ) with a differential spectral index @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "this agrees with a recent result of the hegra group concerning the 1997 - 98 period  @xcite .",
    "it is however in contrast with the former behaviour of the source at the time of the 1995 - 96 flaring period , as observed by the whipple group , who found @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "thus , the higher value of the differential spectral index found in this work could come from a correlation between the intensity level and the spectral hardness , like that observed for mrk  501 in 1997 ( see  @xcite and above ) . a similar evidence for mrk  421 was in fact suggested in @xcite on the basis of the whipple 1995 - 96 low - flux data .",
    "+ in the framework of leptonic models  @xcite , which succesfully explain the mrk  501 broad - band sed in 1997 , the absence of any obvious spectral curvature reported by all experiments implies in any case that the peak energy of the inverse - compton contribution to mrk  421 s spectrum is significantly lower than the cat detection threshold , as for mrk  501 in 1998 .",
    "this is not surprising since the corresponding synchrotron peak is lower than that of mrk  501 in 1997 , and since we have seen that leptonic models predict a strong correlation between x - rays and @xmath0-rays .",
    "in fact , such a correlation was directly observed on mrk  421 in spring 1998 , during a coordinated observation campaign involving ground - based cherenkov imaging telescopes ( whipple , hegra , and cat ) and the asca x - ray satellite@xcite .",

    "since mrk  501 and mrk  421 lie at the the same redshift ( @xmath30.03 ) , spectral differences between them must be intrinsic and not due , in particular , to absorption by the diffuse infrared background radiation .",
    "this allows direct and relevant comparison of their spectral properties .",
    "the correlation between x - ray and @xmath0-ray emissions is now proven for both sources , supporting the simple and most natural scenario given by leptonic models  @xcite for the origin of blazar tev flares , in which a single leptonic population is injected into the radio jets and produces correlated x - ray synchrotron and vhe @xmath0-ray inverse compton radiations .",
    "cat observations complete this picture with some evidence of spectral variability of mrk  501 in 1997 , suggesting that this leptonic population is responsible for the hardening of the entire high - energy part of the electromagnetic spectrum during flares .",
    "to date , the peak @xmath0-energy of mrk  421 has always remained well below the cat threshold , precluding a more accurate spectral study .",
    "therefore , testing vhe spectral variability as a general feature of blazars requires more multiwavelength observations with a large dynamic range in intensity . in any case",
    ", the comparison of the spectral properties of mrk  501 and mrk  421 in 1997 and 1998 fits the picture in which the vhe peak @xmath0-energy shifts with increasing vhe flux : as shown in table  [ tabsummary ] , spectral curvature seems to be characteristic of high flaring - activity states ( i.e. mrk  501 in 1997 ) , whereas low - activity spectra ( i.e. mrk  501 and mrk  421 in 1998 ) are always compatible with pure power - laws .",
