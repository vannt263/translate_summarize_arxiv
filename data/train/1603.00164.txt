    "the deep inelastic scattering(dis ) processes induced by charged leptons and neutrinos / antineutrinos on nucleons and nuclear targets are important tools to study the quark parton structure of free nucleons and the nucleons when they are bound in a nucleus .",
    "the first observation of emc effect in the dis of muon  @xcite from iron target and using electron beam with various nuclear targets at slac  @xcite , discovered that the quark parton distribution of free nucleons are considerably modified when they are bound in a nucleus .",
    "subsequent dis experiments performed on many nuclear targets with charged leptons  @xcite and neutrinos / antineutrinos  @xcite have confirmed the initial results of emc effect .",
    "these experiments make measurements of dis cross sections which are theoretically expressed in terms of nucleon structure functions .",
    "the structure functions are determined by making rosenbluth - like separations of the measured cross section .",
    "the electromagnetic dis cross section induced by charged leptons are given in terms of two structure functions @xmath4",

    "the structure functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related by the callan - gross relation  @xcite . therefore , in this kinematic region , the electromagnetic dis cross sections are expressed in terms of only one structure function chosen to be @xmath12 and the weak dis cross sections are given in terms of two structure functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the dis experiments induced by charged leptons have been done using nuclear targets in the entire region of mass number from light nuclei to heavy nuclei , while the weak dis experiments induced by neutrinos / antineutrinos have been done mainly on medium and heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is very important to study the nuclear medium effects in the cross section and the structure functions determined from these dis experiments in order to understand the structure functions of free nucleons and their modifications in nuclear medium .",
    "considerable theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted to understand the nuclear medium effects on the structure function @xmath15 in electromagnetic and weak interactions as they play dominant role in determining the cross sections",
    ". a precise knowledge of nuclear medium effects in @xmath16 can give information about the higher twist effects in the quark - parton distributions of both valence quarks and sea quarks in the free nucleon as well as their modifications in the nuclear medium in contrast to @xmath17 which is sensitive only to the valence quarks .",
    "consequently a comparative study of @xmath16 and @xmath17 gives very useful information about the properties of sea quarks and their modifications in nuclear medium .",
    "jlab is using high luminosity electron beams to make cross section measurements with several nuclear targets , which have resulted in obtaining wealth of new information on the structure functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 with good precision  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the future plan is to perform these measurements using high energy electron beam of 12  gev in wide range of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in the weak sector ,",
    "several experiments are going on to study neutrino oscillation physics and some of them like minerva  @xcite and dune  @xcite are specially designed to precisely measure neutrino and antineutrino cross sections in the dis region on some nuclear targets like carbon , oxygen , argon , iron and lead .",
    "the presently available data on electromagnetic nuclear structure functions from various experiments  @xcite have been phenomenologically analyzed to determine the nuclear medium effects .    in the phenomenological analyses there are few approaches for determining nuclear parton distribution functions(pdfs ) .",
    "the general approach is that nuclear pdfs are obtained using the charged lepton - nucleus scattering data and analyzing the ratio of the structure functions e.g. @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represent any two nuclei and @xmath23 stands for the deuteron , to determine nuclear correction factor .",
    "the nuclear correction factor is then multiplied with free nucleon pdfs to get nuclear pdfs . while determining the nuclear correction factor , the information regarding nuclear modification is also obtained from the drell - yan cross section ratio like @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where p stands for proton beam .",
    "furthermore , the information about the nuclear correction factor is also supplemented by high energy reaction data from the experiments at lhc , rhic , etc .",
    "this approach has been used by hirai et al .",
    "@xcite , eskola et al .",
    "@xcite , bodek and yang  @xcite , de florian and sassot  @xcite .",
    "the same nuclear correction factor is taken for the weak dis processes . in a recent analysis de florian et al .",
    "@xcite have also included @xmath7-@xmath26 dis data along with the charged lepton - nucleus scattering data and drell - yan data .",
    "their  @xcite conclusion is that the same nuclear correction factor can describe the nuclear medium effect in @xmath27-@xmath26 and @xmath7-@xmath26 dis processes .    in the other approach nuclear pdfs",
    "are directly obtained by analyzing the experimental data i.e without using nucleon pdfs or nuclear correction factor  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been recently used by ncteq  @xcite group in getting @xmath19 , @xmath28 and @xmath17 by analyzing together the charged lepton-@xmath26 dis data and dy @xmath29-@xmath26 data sets , and separately analyzing @xmath30 dis data sets .",
    "their observation is that the nuclear medium effects on @xmath19 in electromagnetic interaction are different from @xmath28 in weak interaction in the region of low @xmath2 .",
    "thus in this region there is a disagreement between the observation of these two studies  @xcite .",
    "the results of cteq collaboration agree with the observation of ccfr and nutev collaborations which had concluded that nuclear medium effects in @xmath28 are different from @xmath19 , in the region of @xmath31 .",
    "this is the region in which nuclear medium effects as well as higher twist effect even at the nucleon level may be important .",
    "the nuclear medium effects due to modifications of sea quark distributions , nuclear shadowing and mesonic contributions are important in this region .",
    "theoretically , there have been very few calculations to study nuclear medium effects in the structure functions but no serious attempt has been made to make a comparison of @xmath19 and @xmath28 structure functions  @xcite , therefore , it is highly desirable to make a detailed study of nuclear medium effects on structure functions in this region .",
    "it has been pointed out that these nuclear structure functions are different in the region of low @xmath2 due to nuclear shadowing effect being different in electromagnetic and weak processes .",
    "it is expected that the nuclear shadowing which is caused by the coherent scattering of hadrons produced in the hadronization process of mediating vector bosons will be different in the case of electromagnetic and weak processes .",
    "this is because the electromagnetic and weak interactions take place through the interaction of photons and @xmath32 bosons , respectively , with the target hadrons and the hadronization processes of photons and @xmath32 bosons are different .",
    "moreover , in the case of weak interaction , the additional contribution of axial current which is not present in the case of electromagnetic interaction may influence the behavior of @xmath28 specially if pions also play a role in the hadronization process through pcac .",
    "furthermore , in this region of low @xmath2 , sea quarks and mesons also play important role which could be different in the case of electromagnetic and weak processes .",
    "for example , the sea quark contribution , though very small is not same for @xmath12 and @xmath13 even at the free nucleon level and could evolve differently in a nuclear medium . a comparative study of mesonic contributions in the case of electromagnetic and weak structure functions should also be made in view of some recent work done for the dis cross sections  @xcite",
    ". therefore , a microscopic understanding of the difference between @xmath19 and @xmath28 will be very instructive for studying the nuclear medium effects in dis processes as emphasized recently at nuint15  @xcite workshop .    in this paper , we have studied nuclear medium effects in the structure functions using a microscopic approach based on field theoretical formalism  @xcite . a relativistic nucleon spectral function has been used to describe the energy and momentum distribution of the nucleons in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this is obtained by using the lehmann s representation for the relativistic nucleon propagator and nuclear many body theory is used to calculate it for an interacting fermi sea in nuclear matter .",
    "a local density approximation is then applied to translate these results to finite nuclei .",
    "moreover , the contributions of the pion and rho meson clouds are also taken into account in a many body field theoretical approach .",
    "this model has been earlier used by us to explain the nuclear medium effects in electromagnetic as well as weak interaction induced processes in the dis region  @xcite .",
