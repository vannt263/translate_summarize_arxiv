    "the he abundance is fundamental in several astrophysical problems .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis models supply tight predictions on the primordial he content , and therefore empirical estimates of this parameter are crucial for constraining their plausibility ( hogan , olive , & scully 1997 ) . at the same time",
    ", stellar evolutionary and pulsational models do require the assumption of a he to metal enrichment ratio @xmath2 in order to reproduce the observed properties of both metal - poor and metal - rich stellar structures ( bono et al .",
    "observational constraints on this parameter can improve the accuracy of several theoretical observables , and in particular of stellar yields predicted by galactic chemical evolution models ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "1997 ; pagel & portinari 1998 ) .",
    "one of the most widely used methods for _ measuring _ the he abundance is to measure fluxes of nebular emission lines in planetary nebulae ( peimbert 1995 ) or in extragalactic h  ii regions ( pagel et al .",
    "1992 ; izotov , thuan , & lipovetsky 1997 ; olive , steigman , & skillman 1997 ) .",
    "independent estimates based on high signal - to - noise measurements of he abundance give very similar results ( @xmath3 ) , thus suggesting that the empirical uncertainties are quite small . however , by adopting detailed radiative transfer calculations of h and he , sasselov & goldwirth ( 1995 ) supported the evidence that current he measurements could be affected by large systematic errors .",
    "the he content can also be obtained by direct spectroscopic measurements in hot horizontal branch ( hb ) stars .",
    "unfortunately , these stars are affected by gravitational settling and by radiation levitation ( michaud et al . 1983 ; moehler et al . 1999 ) , and therefore they might present peculiar abundance patterns . nevertheless , there seems to be a consensus that the primordial he abundance should not be lower than y=0.22 ( olive , steigman , & walker 1999 ) .",
    "both absolute and/or relative he abundances can also be _ estimated _ because the evolution of population ii stars is sensitive to the primordial helium abundance .",
    "the first helium - sensitive indicator to be identified was the r parameter , defined as the ratio between the number of stars along the hb and the number of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars brighter than the hb luminosity ( @xmath4 , iben 1968 ) .",
    "additional parameters also use the helium burning stars of the horizontal branch as abundance indicators .",
    "the @xmath5 parameter is the magnitude difference between hb stars and main sequence ( ms ) stars ( carney 1980 ) and the @xmath6 parameter is the mass - luminosity exponent of rr lyrae stars ( caputo , cayrel , & cayrel de strobel 1983 ) .",
    "the fine structure of the main sequence locus of population ii stars ( faulkner 1967 ) is also a potentially powerful method to constrain @xmath2 . on the basis of hipparcos parallaxes pagel & portinari ( 1998 ) investigated the fine structure of solar neighborhood ms stars and found that the current estimates of @xmath2are still affected by large uncertainties .",
    "the other three methods have been recently applied by sandquist ( 1999 , hereinafter s99 ) to a sample of 42 galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) .",
    "sandquist also comprehensively discusses the pros and cons of these abundance indicators and in particular the statistical and systematic errors affecting both absolute and relative he estimates .",
    "the results by s99 support the evidence that both the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 parameter can only give reliable relative he abundances , due to current uncertainties on the metallicity scale and on the rr lyrae temperature scale . at the same time",
    ", s99 brought out that absolute he abundances based on the r parameter ( @xmath7 ) could also be affected by additional systematic errors , and that both relative and absolute estimates do not show , within current uncertainties , a clear evidence of a trend with metallicity .",
    "the latter finding does not support the results by renzini ( 1994 ) , minniti ( 1995 ) , bertelli et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and desidera , bertelli , & ortolani ( 1998 ) who suggest that in the galactic bulge the he abundance scales with metallicity according to a slope ranging from 2 to 3.5",
    ". moreover detailed comparisons between solar standard models and accurate helioseismic data ( ciacio , deglinnocenti & ricci 1997 ; deglinnocenti et al . 1997 ; christensen - dalsgaard 1998 ) is more consistent with @xmath2@xmath8 .",
    "the large spread in the empirical values suggests that current he estimates are still hampered by large uncertainties which do not allow us to disentangle the intrinsic variation , if any , from systematic effects .",
    "the empirical evaluation of the r parameter relies only on star counts .",
    "nevertheless , misleading effects can be introduced by the method adopted for fixing the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) luminosity , by differential reddening , as well as by the occurrence of population gradients inside the cluster ( buzzoni et al .",
    "1983 ; caputo , martinez roger , & paez 1987 ; djorgovski & piotto 1993 ; bono et al . 1995 ; s99 ) .",
    "the he abundance is estimated by comparing observed values with the ratio of hb and rgb evolutionary times , which relies on evolutionary predictions characterized by a negligible dependence on stellar age ( iben & rood 1969 ) .",
    "the he burning lifetimes do depend on input physics such as equation of state , opacity , and nuclear cross sections ( brocato , castellani , & villante 1998 ; cassisi et al .",
    "1998 ) adopted to construct hb models as well as on the algorithm adopted for treating the mixing processes ( sweigart 1990 , and references therein ) .",
    "the main aim of this investigation is to derive the r parameter for a sample of 26 ggcs , and to compare empirical values with theoretical predictions in order to gather information on both the he content and its trend with metallicity . in order to accomplish this goal",
    "we specifically calculate a large set of hb models , adopting the most up - to - date input physics .",
    "we rely on the high number of stars sampled in each cluster , on the wide metallicity range covered by clusters , and on the high homogeneity of theoretical predictions and data to constrain the behavior of both r and @xmath2parameters .",
    "we evaluate the r parameter in 26 ggcs of our hst database ( zoccali et al . 1999 ,",
    "hereinafter z99 , and references therein ) including images from the hst projects go-6095 and go-7470 , and similar data retrieved from the hst archive . to avoid systematic uncertainties in the star counts , we exclude from the sample the clusters affected by strong foreground contamination ( ngc  6522 , ngc  6441 ) , as well as those having hot hb stars close to the magnitude limit and for which the completeness correction was not estimated ( ngc  6205 ) .",
    "the r parameter is defined as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of rgb stars brighter than a reference luminosity , generally fixed according to the luminosity of rr lyrae stars ( buzzoni et al .",
    "1983 ) or to the zahb luminosity ( bono et al .",
    "1995 ) . however , the accurate determination of this luminosity is often a thorny problem .",
    "in fact , together with the well - known difficulties in estimating the rr lyrae luminosity and/or the zahb luminosity for clusters with only red or blue hb morphologies , we are also dealing with the problem of the differential bolometric correction between hb and rgb stars .",
    "this means that , as soon as the hb luminosity / magnitude is fixed , the proper rgb magnitude at this luminosity can be estimated only by accounting for the change in the bolometric correction between hb and rgb structures .",
    "current estimates have been derived by adopting different assumptions on the value of the bolometric correction and on its variation with metallicity .",
    "therefore , the comparison among the r values available in the literature it is not straightforward even for the same clusters .",

    "it is worth noting that such a completeness correction is significant only for extreme blue hb stars and that the correction to the r parameter is always smaller than 5% .",
    "the only exception is ngc  2808 , a cluster which shows a very long and populated hb blue tail , and a very high central density . by applying the completeness correction to this cluster the r parameter changed by @xmath33 .",
    "figure 1 shows the comparison between empirical r values and theoretical predictions at fixed age ( 14 gyr ) for three different assumptions about the he content and for metal abundances ranging from [ m / h]=@xmath34 to solar chemical composition . at fixed composition ,",
    "a large set of evolutionary models for both h and he burning phases was constructed by adopting the input physics already discussed by cassisi & salaris ( 1997 , hereinafter cs ) . as usual , the hb lifetime is estimated on the basis of the hb model located at @xmath35 , i.e. by assuming as representative of @xmath24 the central he burning time of a structure whose zahb is inside the rr lyrae instability strip .",
    "our calculations confirm iben s ( 1968 ) original finding that the r parameter is virtually independent of the adopted cluster age .",
    "the comparison between theory and observations also confirms the finding by s99 that the absolute he content resulting from the r - method is @xmath36 . as discussed in section 1 , this value is significantly lower than the canonical he abundance expected from the primordial nucleosynthesis and measured in the hii regions , showing that there is some systematic uncertainty affecting the calibration of r as a function of y.            as discussed in brocato et al .",

    "figure 2 displays the dependence of the theoretical r values on an increase / decrease by a factor of two in the efficiency of the quoted reaction when compared with the value provided by caughlan et al .",
    "even though the range of the nuclear cross section values used in fig .",
    "2 is quite large , it is still inside the current error of its empirical measurements ( buchmann 1996 ) .",
    "this fact clearly shows the sensitivity of the predicted r values on input physics , and suggests that the r method can not be presently used for the determination of the absolute he abundance .",
    "instead , we can use the r parameter to constrain the input parameters of the model .",
    "if we rely on primordial he abundance measurements in extragalactic hii regions , and we assume that mixing processes have been properly accounted for in current hb models , the data plotted in fig .",
    "2 suggest that the current value of the @xmath0nuclear cross section should be roughly a factor of two smaller .",
    "this notwithstanding , we can still use the r parameter to constrain the still controversial @xmath2value .",
    "first of all , we note that even for constant y , the r values plotted in fig .",
    "1 present a trend with metallicity . for [ m / h]@xmath37",
    "the empirical r values show an increase and then a flat distribution . as already noted by desidera et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , this behavior is due to the fact that an increase in metallicity causes the luminosity of the rgb bump to become fainter than the zahb luminosity , as shown by z99 , and it is well reproduced by the models ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in order to investigate the trend of the relative he content with the global metallicity , in fig .",
    "3 we plot the residuals of the measured r values with respect to the model that better reproduces the data in fig . 1 , i.e. y=0.20 .",
    "we emphasize that the absolute value of y adopted as reference only changes the vertical zero point of fig .",
    "3 . we would obtain the same distribution using a y=0.23 model with a @xmath0smaller by a factor of two .",
    "the two dashed lines show the expected variation in the he abundance using two different assumed values for @xmath2 .",
    "the present data suggest that the upper limit to the he to metal enrichment ratio should be @xmath12.5 . in particular the data would appear to exclude @xmath2@xmath38 because this would require to count , at metallicity [ m / h]@xmath39 , a number of hb stars lower than that observed by about @xmath40 , or , conversely , a number of rgb stars higher by the same amount .",
    "although toward higher metallicity our counts could be contaminated by upper agb stars , the stellar lifetimes of this objects can not account for such a high effect .. on the other hand , the number of red hb stars can be affected by systematic error , although not as high as @xmath40 , only for the clusters affected by strong differential reddening , such as ngc  6388 ( because the hb red clump merges into the rgb ) .",
    "the cmd of other metal - rich clusters ( ngc  5927 and ngc  6624 ) show very well separated hb and rgb ( sosin et al .",
    "1997 ) and can not be affected by such a problem .",
    "our finding of a @xmath2@xmath41 confirms the original results by peimbert & torres - peimbert ( 1976 ) , and more recently by peimbert & peimbert ( 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "figure  3 shows another interesting feature : metal - poor ggcs present on average a larger r value .",
    "a similar conclusion was recently reached in s99 , who also note that ggcs with blue hb morphology also have systematically large r parameters ; they offer no explanation for this effect . keeping in mind this problem ,",
    "we investigate the behavior of each single term in the predicted time ratio .",
    "figure 4 shows the key theoretical ingredients of this parameter i.e. @xmath24 ( top ) , @xmath25 ( middle ) , and the magnitudes of both zahb and rgb bump ( bottom ) as a function of metallicity .",
    "the dependence of both @xmath42 and @xmath43 on metallicity accounts for the slope disclosed by both empirical and theoretical r values ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in fact , for metallicity larger than [ m / h]@xmath44 , the @xmath25 presents a sudden decrease caused by the fact that the rgb bump becomes fainter than the zahb .",
    "this occurrence implies a strong decrease in @xmath25 , since , for clusters in this metallicity range , the rgb bump phase alone contributes for @xmath120% to the total @xmath25 value .",
    "this means that small changes in @xmath42 can cause substantial variations in the r value .",
    "this effect explains why the r values of the intermediate metallicity clusters present a large scatter .",
    "the values of @xmath24 shown in fig .  4 refer to a star located in the middle of the rr lyrae instability strip ( @xmath35 ) . however , current evolutionary calculations ( castellani et al . 1994 ) suggest that the lifetime of blue tail hb stars is roughly 30% longer when compared with the lifetimes of hb stars located inside the instability strip . as a consequence , to assess whether predicted r values",
    "are affected by systematic uncertainties we must explore in more detail the dependence of the r parameter on @xmath24 and in particular on hb morphology .",
    "we split the hb into three different regions , namely the hb stars bluer than rr lyrae variables ( b ) , the rr lyrae variables ( v ) , and the hb stars redder than rr lyrae variables ( r ) ( lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 ) . as a plausible estimate for the blue and the red edge of the rr lyrae instability strip we adopted , according to bono et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , @xmath45 and 5900 k respectively .",
    "on the basis of these ingredients , and by assuming a linear mass distribution along the hb , we estimated the average hb lifetime , @xmath46 , at fixed he abundance @xmath47 , for stars belonging to b , v , and r regions respectively .",
    "figure 5 shows the theoretical r parameters for the three different hb morphologies .",
    "the r values based on the hb lifetime of rr lyrae stars  @xmath48  are almost identical to those based on @xmath49 .",
    "thus suggesting that @xmath50 is representative of central he - burning lifetime for gcs characterized by hb stars with @xmath51 . on the other hand , we find that the lifetimes of blue hb stars  @xmath52  are approximately 20% longer than @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this means that the r values of ggcs with blue hb morphologies are expected to be @xmath53 units higher than those with red hbs .",
    "therefore the observed high r values in metal - poor clusters are not due to a real increase in the he abundance , but are likely the consequence of their blue hb morphology .",
    "the large scatter among metal - poor clusters is mainly due to the different stellar distributions along the blue tail ( see fig .  9 in piotto",
    "et al . 1999 ) .",
    "[ height=0.62 , width=1]fig5.ps    in conclusion , a correct measure of the absolute he content on the basis of the r parameter requires the construction , for any given cluster , of a synthetic cmd which properly reproduces the distribution of the stars along the hb and in turn a meaningful evaluation of the @xmath24 .",
    "however , this approach is beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "we have measured the helium - sensitive r parameter in 26 galactic globular clusters imaged with wfpc2 on board the hubble space telescope .",
    "our calculated r values are based on star counts that are corrected for completeness and tested for radial variations within each cluster .",
    "the high quality hst photometry also permits more clear separation of the hb , agb , and rgb stars .",
    "the comparison between predicted and empirical r values appears to be consistent with the absolute he abundance being lower than that found from the observations of hii regions and from the primordial nucleosynthesis models .",
    "one approach to overcome this discrepancy is to adopt a @xmath0nuclear cross section about a factor of two smaller than current canonical values .",
    "we note that hb lifetimes depend not only on nuclear reaction rates , but also on the efficiency of mixing processes and on the algorithms adopted for handling these physical mechanisms . in fact , as recently suggested by cassisi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , current algorithms adopted for quenching the `` breathing pulses '' introduce a @xmath54 uncertainty on @xmath24 . as a consequence ,",
    "the r parameter can not presently be absolutely calibrated in terms of a helium abundance .",
    "the only trend in our data set is an unphysical trend toward higher helium abundance in the clusters of lowest metallicity .",
    "these clusters tend to have blue horizontal branches , and we argue that longer hb lifetimes in high temperature hb stars likely account for this trend .",
    "in fact , the global trend in r with metallicity is well accounted for by changes in hb lifetime as a function of metal abundance .",
    "the trend in r values of the metal - rich globular clusters in our sample is consistent with an upper limit of 2.5 for the helium to metal enrichment ratio ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the increased dispersion in r for the intermediate metallicity clusters may be caused by the rgb bump fading below the hb luminosity at [ fe / h]@xmath55 , causing a drop in the calculated rgb lifetime .",
    "we conclude that these factors make the r values of low and intermediate globular clusters less useful in constraining the helium abundance .",
    "accurate photometric data for metal - rich globular clusters , however , do place an interesting constraint on @xmath2 .",
    "the ggcs in the galactic bulge are certainly a key target to accomplish these measurements .",
    "it is not a trivial effort to collect high quality data for such clusters , since they are often affected by high absolute and differential extinction ( ortolani et al . 1999 ) , but the new nir detectors should allow us to overcome these difficulties and to secure accurate data for a sizable fraction of cluster stars .",
    "a reconsideration of the bulge clusters and field population would also be in order given the results of minniti ( 1995 ) ; when his counts are corrected for the contribution of agb stars , the bulge fields have r values of 1.7 to 2 , higher than those of the most metal - rich clusters in our sample .",
    "the promise of the r parameter being a constraint on the primordial helium abundance remains frustratingly unfulfilled .",
    "two further thorny problems affect sound empirical estimates of this parameter , namely the foreground contamination and the radial population gradients .",
    "the former can be overcome by including only the innermost regions , whereas the latter is an open problem , since we still lack a systematic and quantitative estimate of this effect in ggcs from the very center to the tidal radius ( walker 1999 ) .",
    "the precise comparison of synthetic h - r diagrams with observational data may be required to achieve further progress .",

    "<S> we estimate the empirical r parameter in 26 galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) covering a wide metallicity range , imaged by wfpc2 on board the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the improved spatial resolution permits a large fraction of the evolved stars to be measured and permits accurate assessment of radial populaton gradients and completeness corrections . in order to evaluate both the he abundance and the he to metal enrichment ratio </S>",
    "<S> , we construct a large set of evolutionary models by adopting similar metallicities and different he contents . </S>",
    "<S> we find an absolute he abundance which is lower than that estimated from spectroscopic measurements in hii regions and from primordial nucleosynthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy could be removed by adopting a @xmath0nuclear cross section about a factor of two smaller than the canonical value , although also different assumptions for mixing processes can introduce systematical effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the trend in the r parameter toward solar metallicity is consistent with an upper limit to the he to metal enrichment ratio of the order of 2.5 </S>",
    "<S> . detailed calculations of central he - burning times as a function of the hb morphology suggest that he lifetimes for hot hb stars are on average @xmath1 20% longer than for rr lyrae and red hb stars . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the increase in the empirical r values of metal - poor clusters characterized by blue hb morphologies is due to an increase in the hb lifetime and not due to an increase in the he abundance . </S>"
