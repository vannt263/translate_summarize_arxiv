    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are of great importance both as astrophysical objects and as cosmological distance indicators .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the rate at which they occur ( as a function of redshift ) is essential for understanding both of these roles .",
    "astrophysically , sne  ia play an important role in galaxy evolution .",
    "they are a major source of iron ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and inject energy into the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sn  ia rate is necessary to include these effects in galaxy evolution models , particularly at high redshifts where much of the important galaxy evolution occurs .",
    "cosmologically , sne  ia are the best - tested method for measuring the scale factor of the universe as a function of redshift , with hundreds of sne now employed in the precision measurement of cosmological parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite their widespread use as distance indicators , the process that leads to a sn  ia is still not well understood .",
    "sne  ia are widely accepted to be the end result of a carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarf ( wd ) nearing the chandrasekhar mass limit but how they near that limit is not known ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "this leaves open the question of whether high - redshift sne are different from low - redshift sne in a way that affects the inferred distance .",
    "measurements of the change in the sn  ia rate with redshift can be used to distinguish between models of how sne  ia occur . while there are a variety of sn  ia progenitor models , most fall into two classes : the _ single degenerate scenario _ ( sd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the _ double degenerate scenario _",
    "( dd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the single degenerate scenario ,",
    "the wd accretes mass from a red giant or main sequence star that overflows its roche lobe . in the double degenerate scenario ,",
    "the wd merges with a second white dwarf after orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "crucially , the delay time between the initial formation of the system and the sn explosion is governed by a different physical mechanism in the different models .",
    "this allows us to differentiate between models by measuring the distribution of the delay times for a population of sne .",
    "the shape of this delay time distribution ( dtd ) depends on the details of the binary star evolution ( particularly its evolution through one or more common envelope phases ) and the specific progenitor model .",
    "one method for measuring the dtd is to correlate the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) with the the cosmic sn  ia rate as a function of redshift @xcite : the rate as a function of cosmic time is simply the cosmic sfh convolved with the dtd .",
    "the volumetric sn  ia rate has now been measured in many different sn surveys designed to detect and measure sne at @xmath7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the recently revised rates from the ifa deep survey @xcite ,",
    "most of these @xmath7 measurements have now come into agreement .",
    "in contrast , measurements at @xmath8 have been limited to sn searches in the goods fields @xcite using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and ultra - deep single - epoch searches in the subaru deep field ( sdf ) from the ground @xcite .",
    "these studies have yielded discrepant results for the dtd .",
    "the first @xmath8 measurements by @xcite ( and later * ? ? ?",
    "* with an expanded dataset ) showed a rate that peaked at @xmath6 and decreased in the highest - redshift bin at @xmath9 . from these results",
    "the best - fit dtd is one tightly confined to 34 gyr with very few sne ia having short delay times @xcite .",
    "the recent results of @xcite from the sdf show a lower rate at @xmath6 , and a higher rate in the highest - redshift bin compared with @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with a flat sn rate at @xmath10 .",
    "they find that the dtd is consistent with a power law with the best - fit @xmath11 , implying a significant fraction of short delay time ( @xmath12  gyr ) sne .",
    "relative to the _ hst _ measurements , the sdf measurements cover a much larger volume and therefore have the advantage of better statistics in the highest - redshift bin , but",
    "measurements hold advantages in systematics .",
    "a rolling search with _ hst _ offers multiple observations of each sn and much higher resolution than possible from the ground , useful for resolving sne from the cores of their hosts .",
    "these factors lead to a more robust identification of sne  ia relative to the sdf searches where a single observation is used for both detection and photometric typing .",
    "in addition , the @xcite analysis used spectroscopic typing in addition to photometric typing , whereas @xcite uses only photometric typing . in general",
    ", the very different strategies employed make _ hst _ measurements a good cross - check for the sdf measurements and vice versa . increasing the statistics in _ hst",
    "_ rate measurements can make this cross - check better and improve dtd constraints . at the same time , in comparing the measurements it is important to carefully consider possible systematic differences , particularly as statistical uncertainty decreases and systematics come to dominate .    in this paper , we address these issues by ( 1 ) supplementing current determinations of the _ hst_-based @xmath1 sn  ia rate and ( 2 ) comparing the effect on results of different dust distributions assumed in previous analyses .",
    "we use observations from the _ hst _ cluster supernova survey , a survey to discover and follow sne  ia in very distant clusters ( * ? ? ?",

    "we briefly summarize it here .",
    "candidates were detected in subtractions of @xmath17 images and examined by eye to eliminate obviously false detections such as stellar diffraction spikes .",
    "a total of 86 candidates were selected in this phase .",
    "detailed information on all 86 of these candidates is available from the survey website .",
    "we generated a full light curve in @xmath17 and @xmath18 for each of these candidates and then imposed automated requirements on the light curve .",
    "these included a requirement on the flux in @xmath18 and the rapidity of the rise and fall of the light curve .",
    "after this step , 60 sn candidates remained .",
    "( the selections up to this point are accounted for in our calculation of detection efficiency . )",
    "the remaining candidates were then divided into image artifacts ( 14 ) , agn ( 17 ) , and supernovae ( 29 ) on the basis of the light curve shape and evidence from image subtractions .",
    "for example , candidates on the cores of bright galaxies and showing adjoining positive and negative regions in image subtractions are likely to be the result of image mis - alignment . with corroborating evidence from the light curves of such candidates , they are confidently dismissed as image artifacts .",
    "similarly , candidates deemed to be agn were located on the cores of galaxies and exhibited light curves that look nothing like sne light curves : most rose or fell over periods of 100 + days .",
    "in general , the continuous light curve monitoring in the survey made possible to separate these artifacts and agn from sne with high confidence .",
    "for the remaining 29 candidates deemed to be sne , we determined a sn type and confidence for each . in table",
    "[ table : sne ] we list the sne along with their host galaxy redshifts , sn types and confidence . we omit the eight sne whose hosts are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members .",
    "see figure  4 of b11 for images , light curves and light curve fits of all candidates . a complete description of the sn coordinates , typing and confidence level ( plausible , probable , or secure ) is given in b11 .",
    "briefly , a secure sn  ia has either spectroscopic confirmation , or evidence from two sources ( early - type host galaxy and light curve ) ruling out other types .",
    "a probable sn  ia is slightly less certain than a secure sn  ia , but still a high - confidence sn  ia : the light curve rules out all core collapse subtypes .",
    "a plausible sn  ia has a light curve that is more indicative of a sn  ia than sn  cc , but is not sufficient to rule out all core - collapse types .    in this analysis",
    "we use two additional selections not used in b11 : ( 1 ) first , we eliminate candidates that could only be consistent with a sn  ia if it peaked prior to 10 rest - frame days before the first observation .",
    "we found that lower - redshift ( @xmath19 ) sne were detectable even when peaking well before the first observation , but that such sne were extremely difficult to type as they were observed only far into the light curve decline .",
    "we found it most `` fair '' to eliminate such candidates entirely .",
    "we include the same selection in our efficiency simulations below .",
    "only scp06l21 and scp05n10 are rejected based on this selection , but both are below the redshift range of greatest interest ( @xmath20 ) and at least scp05n10 is incompatible with an sn  ia light curve anyway .",
    "this was not an issue for b11 because sne of interest ( at @xmath21 ) are not detectable very far after peak .",
    "\\(2 ) second , we exclude regions within @xmath22 of cluster centers , in order to avoid the most strongly lensed areas in the volume behind the clusters .",
    "this region is only @xmath23@xmath24 of the observed field of each cluster .",
    "note that we were careful to choose this radius before looking at the radii of any of the candidates , in order to avoid biasing ourselves by adjusting the radius to conveniently exclude or include candidates .",
    "two candidates were excluded as a result : sne scp06b3 ( @xmath25 from the cluster center ) and scp06m50 ( @xmath26 from the cluster center ) .",
    "as it happens , these candidates are unlikely to be sne  ia .",
    "sn scp06b3 is a `` probable '' sn  cc , while sn scp06m50 is possibly not a sn at all and may be hosted by a cluster member galaxy , making its position near the cluster center unsurprising .",
    "the exclusion of this region is taken into account in our simulations (  [ ratecalc ] ) .",
    "the effect of lensing on the remaining portions of the fields are discussed in  [ sec : lensing ] .",
    "the systematic uncertainties associated with the determination of sn type and redshift for the remaining candidates are addressed in ",
    "[ sec : systyping ] .",
    "we calculate the sn  ia rate in redshift bins using what has become a standard method in rate calculations : the number of sne  ia per unit time per comoving volume is estimated in the redshift bin @xmath27 by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of sne  ia discovered between redshifts @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the denominator is the total effective time - volume for which the survey is sensitive to sne ia in the redshift range @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 is the _ effective visibility time _ ( also known as the `` control time '' ) and is calculated by integrating the probability of detecting a sn  ia as a function of time over the active time of the survey .",
    "@xmath33 depends on the dates and depths of observations , as well as the specific requirements for selecting sne .",
    "the factor of @xmath34 converts from observer - frame time to rest - frame time at redshift @xmath35 .",
    "the last two terms in the denominator represent the volume comoving element between @xmath35 and @xmath36 observed in the survey .",
    "@xmath37 is the comoving volume of a spherical shell of width @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the solid angle observed in the survey , in units of steradians .",
    "( @xmath40 is the fraction of the spherical shell we have observed . ) finally , the average redshift of the bin , weighted by the volume effectively observed , is given by @xmath41    as in b11 , we use an effective visibility time that depends on position , as observation dates and depths vary within each observed field .",
    "that is , in equation  ( [ eq : fieldrate ] ) we make the substitution @xmath42 @xmath43 is calculated by simulating sn  ia light curves at different positions , redshifts and times during the survey , and determining the probability that each simulated sn would be detected and counted in our sn sample .",
    "we pass each simulated sn through the same automated selections used to select the 60 candidates in our initial sample .",
    "additionally , we discard simulated sne peaking prior to 10 rest - frame days before the first observation , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "we characterize the diversity of sn  ia light curves as a two - parameter family ( stretch @xmath44 and color @xmath45 ) with an additional intrinsic dispersion in luminosity .",
    "the absolute magnitude of each simulated sn is set to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the magnitude of an @xmath48 , @xmath49 sn  ia in our assumed cosmology @xcite , @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xcite , and @xmath52 is an added `` intrinsic dispersion '' , randomly drawn from a gaussian distribution centered at zero with @xmath53  mag , as seen in @xcite .",
    "this produces a set of simulated sne that closely matches the distribution seen in @xcite . to calculate the flux of each simulated sn in the observed @xmath17 and @xmath18 filters , we use the @xcite spectral time series template .",
    "the main difference from b11 is that we use distributions for stretch and color that are representative of sne in the field rather than in clusters . for stretch",
    ", we look to the observed stretch distribution of the first - year sample from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cut at @xmath54 to limit malmquist bias ( figure  [ fig : dists ] , grey histogram ) .",
    "we assume this sample is complete , fit a smooth curve to the distribution ( same panel , solid line ) , and use this for simulated sne .    for color",
    ", we can not assume the snls sample ( figure  [ fig : dists ] , histogram in right panel ) is complete even at @xmath54 , as highly reddened sne will have been missed .",
    "the standard picture today is that the observed distribution of sn colors is due to a combination of both intrinsic sn color variation and host galaxy extinction @xcite .",
    "both of these are expected to introduce a color that correlates with sn luminosity , possibly with different strengths ( @xmath55 is typically found to be smaller than the canonical value of @xmath56 for milky way dust ) . in order to capture both effects with a single color distribution and a single @xmath55 , we work backwards from the desired host galaxy extinction distribution .",
    "we wish to achieve a host galaxy extinction distribution of @xmath57 with @xmath58 , the best - fit value for host - galaxy sn extinction in the sdss - ii sn survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k09 ) .",
    "to do this we use a color distribution of @xmath59 , because @xmath60 is related to @xmath45 via @xmath61 .",
    "this ensures the desired @xmath60 distribution is obtained for any given value of @xmath55 .",
    "the full @xmath62 distribution is then a convolution of this @xmath62 distribution from host galaxy dust and the intrinsic distribution of sn color ( assumed to be gaussian ) .",
    "the gaussian parameters of the intrinsic distribution are chosen so that the full convolved @xmath62 distribution matches the observed snls @xmath45 distribution at @xmath63 .",
    "the result is a @xmath62 distribution ( black line in right panel of figure  [ fig : dists ] ) that matches the snls sample where we expect it to be complete ( @xmath63 ) and also has the desired behavior at large extinction based on our assumed @xmath64 distribution .",
    "we use this distribution in our simulation . in  [ sec : sysdust ] we assess the systematic uncertainty associated with host galaxy dust by using alternate color distributions obtained using the same method , but different @xmath64 distributions ( other curves in the same panel ) .",
    "@xmath43 is calculated in bins of 100 @xmath65 100  pixels ( @xmath66 ) in position . in each @xmath66 region , we simulate 50 sn light curves with random parameters and random position ( within the bin ) and take the average effective visibility time of the 50 sne ( @xmath2380,000 sne per field ) . summing over all areas observed in all 25 fields yields @xmath33 . in doing",
    "so we exclude regions within @xmath22 of cluster centers , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "we calculate @xmath33 at intervals of @xmath67 in redshift .",

    "the area actually observed is slightly more complicated and sne are detected over a slightly larger time range . from @xmath70 ,",
    "the effective visibility time actually increases slightly out to @xmath71 as sn light curves are time - dilated and are thus visible for longer .",
    "afterwards , we begin to miss sne that peak during the observations . in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : ctarea1 ] , we convert to the rest - frame time - volume observed in each redshift bin of @xmath67 using the assumed cosmology .",

    "the increase is @xmath2312% , and the decrease is @xmath2310% . at @xmath111",
    "the increase overwhelms the decrease ( @xmath2327% versus @xmath2313% ) , but there will be very few sne detected beyond @xmath117 ( see figure  [ fig : ctarea1 ] ) . therefore , we have not made an adjustment for these effects .",
    "furthermore , the size of each effect is much smaller than other sources of systematic uncertainty considered below .",
    "for example , the average magnification at @xmath111 is only @xmath231.08 ( @xmath118  mag ) , whereas below we consider the effect of changing the luminosity of all sne in our simulation by @xmath119  magnitudes .",
    "so , we do not assign a specific systematic uncertainty to lensing effects .",
    "the degree to which sne are affected by host galaxy dust extinction is perhaps the largest systematic uncertainty in sn  ia rate studies . here , we consider alternatives to the extinction distribution used in  [ ratecalc ] and evaluate the effect on the results . specifically , we reproduce three @xmath64 distributions considered in @xcite and @xcite . in each of these models , as for our main result , we constrain @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "the first , `` model a , '' is used for the main result in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the model of @xcite , constructed to estimate extinction in local disk galaxies .",
    "the distribution in figure 3 of @xcite is well approximated by @xmath122 this distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : extinction ] .",
    "the second distribution we consider , `` model b , '' is used by @xcite as an alternative distribution .",
    "it is based on the models in @xcite , which are aimed at generalizing the @xcite models to a variety of dust properties and a variety of spiral hubble types . here",
    "we approximate the distribution by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the dirac delta function , used here to assign 35% of sne to the lowest host galaxy extinction bin .",
    "the third distribution we consider , labeled `` model c , '' is used in the rate analysis of @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath125 all three of these distributions are reproduced in figure  [ fig : extinction ] , and the corresponding distributions of sn color are shown in figure  [ fig : dists ] ( right panel ) .",
    "in addition to these three distributions , we also consider a distribution with minimal dust , where we assume the snls @xmath54 sample is complete and fit it with a skewed gaussian distribution .",
    "the effective visibility time for each dust model is shown in figure  [ fig : ctarea1 ] and the corresponding sn rate results are shown in figure  [ fig : fieldrates1 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "of all the models , model a produces the most strikingly different results for the effective visibility time . even in the lowest redshift bin ( @xmath126 )",
    "it implies that 10% of sne are missed due to dust , relative to the k09 model . in the @xmath127 redshift bin ,",
    "it yields effective visibility times lower by 27% , while models b , c and the minimal dust model result in changes of only @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 respectively .",
    "this is unsurprising : in model a , 26% of sne have host galaxy extinctions @xmath131 while this fraction is @xmath132 in model b and @xmath133 in models k09 and c. in the @xmath134 bin model a has the largest effect : @xmath135 compared to the k09 model . as the work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* model b ) is aimed at generalizing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* model a ) for use at higher redshifts , model b may be viewed as more applicable . along these lines ,",
    "@xcite have noted that using the @xcite model appears to over - correct sn rates .    still , for the systematic uncertainty associated with the choice of dust model we take a conservative approach , using the full range of these models .",
    "we use the minimal dust model to obtain the lower limit on the rate and model a for the upper limit .",
    "this confidence range is shown in table  [ table : syserr ] .",
    "several studies have pointed out that extinction is likely to increase with redshift , due to increasing star formation in dusty environments @xcite .",
    "the potential effect on the sn  ia extinction distribution is difficult to quantify as it depends not only on the relation between star formation and dust ejection but also the sn  ia delay time distribution .",
    "however , we estimate that any possible redshift - dependence is well - encompassed by the conservatively large range of extinction models we use above .",
    "@xcite estimated that the average extinction @xmath136 peaks at @xmath6 , at a value @xmath230.15  mag higher than locally .",
    "the effect of such an additional dimming on our rates at @xmath6 is approximately 10% , whereas the extinction distribution uncertainty already included above is @xmath2350% .",
    "similarly , @xcite estimated the fraction of missing sne to be 513% in the redshift range @xmath10 based on the work of @xcite .",
    "as the difference induced by our use of the k09 extinction model rather than model c used by graur et al .",
    "is already much greater than this , we do not make an explicit correction for increasing dust at high redshift .",
    "in addition to the choice of the host galaxy dust extinction distribution , other assumptions about sn properties can affect the derived rates .",
    "these include the absolute magnitude , the stretch distribution , and the spectral time series template . fortunately these properties are well constrained . for example , shifting the stretch distribution by @xmath137 would be inconsistent with the observed distribution , and similarly for the color distribution .",
    "the average absolute magnitude of sne  ia ( in our cosmology ) is constrained to much better than @xmath138  mag @xcite .",
    "to first order , changing any of these assumptions affects the derived rate by increasing or decreasing the luminosity of the simulated sn and thereby increasing or decreasing the effective visibility time .",
    "therefore , to estimate the effect of such changes on the result , we simply shift the absolute magnitude of the simulated sne  ia .",
    "a shift in stretch of @xmath137 is equivalent to a magnitude shift of @xmath139 .",
    "similarly , a shift in color of @xmath140 is equivalent to a magnitude shift of @xmath141 .",
    "conservatively then , we use a @xmath119  mag shift to jointly capture these uncertainties and uncertainty in the absolute magnitude . the effect on the results",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : fieldrates1 ] ( right panel ) and is generally comparable to or smaller than the effect from the extinction distribution uncertainty ( see table  [ table : syserr ] ) .",
    "there are various effects that could increase or decrease the density of galaxies in the observed fields relative to the cosmic average , potentially biasing the volumetric rates .",
    "we have estimated all such effects to be small ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "we briefly discuss three of these effects .",
    "\\(1 ) _ masking volume surrounding clusters . _",
    "any sn occurring in the volume around a cluster ( within @xmath143 ) but not associated with the cluster would be mistakenly assigned to the cluster .",
    "this volume is therefore effectively not counted for this analysis .",
    "we estimate that this decreases the total volume in the @xmath127 redshift bin by @xmath1441.5% ( due to the presence of 5 clusters ) and in the @xmath145 bin by @xmath1446% ( due to the presence of 20 clusters ) .",
    "because the next effect compensates somewhat for this effect , we do not make an explicit correction in the result .",
    "\\(2 ) _ cluster - galaxy correlation . _ there may be an increase in the density of field galaxies ( relative to the cosmic average ) in the volume surrounding the cluster due to the presence of the cluster itself .",
    "however , we estimate that this effect should be small outside of the volume discussed in the previous effect . at @xmath146 ,",
    "a redshift difference of @xmath147 corresponds to a comoving distance of @xmath2336  mpc .",
    "density fluctuations on these scales are in the linear regime . at 36  mpc ,",
    "the correlation function of massive galaxies is @xmath148 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even if the average over - density at scales 36  mpc @xmath149 100  mpc were 0.2 ( an overestimate ) , this would only be a 23% effect on the total galaxy density in a bin of width @xmath150 .",
    "\\(3 ) _ cosmic variance .",
    "_ cosmic variance could affect the results if there is an under - density or over - density of field galaxies in the observed regions ( relative to the cosmic average ) .",
    "in b11 , we estimated the size of this effect in the goods fields , finding it to contribute a systematic uncertainty of 46% based on the cosmic variance calculator of @xcite and the difference between the goods - n and goods - s fields ( see also discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the effect is even smaller for the 25 fields in this study : here we have more than two widely separated fields , providing a better sampling of cosmic variance .",
    "the results from this study are available as a machine - readable table from the journal or the survey website .",
    "we include the product of the effective visibility time and observed area , as a function of redshift ( figure  [ fig : ctarea1 ] ) , for a variety of assumptions about sn properties and host galaxy dust distributions . with these data and the sn candidate list",
    ", the rates from this survey can be recomputed in any arbitrary redshift bin and for any of these assumptions .",
    "this will make it easy to combine these results with other measurements for increased statistical power .      in figure",
    "[ fig : ratecompilation ] we compare our results to an assortment of other volumetric sn ia rate measurements .",
    "( all measurements have been corrected to our assumed cosmology . )",
    "our results are generally consistent with the three published measurements at @xmath1 : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ku08 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter d08 ) , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g11 ) .",
    "d08 and g11 supplant earlier results from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the ku08 and d08 measurements are based on sn searches in the _ hst _ goods fields , with ku08 being an independent analysis of a subset of the data used in d08 .",
    "these sn searches used acs to cover the goods fields with a 45 day cadence and triggered followup ( imaging and spectroscopy ) of sn candidates .",
    "the d08 analysis uses a sn typing method based on both spectroscopy and photometry ( similar to the approach used here ) while ku08 use a photometric - only pseudo - bayesian approach to typing .",
    "the g11 measurement is based on `` single - detection '' searches in the subaru deep field .",
    "g11 also use a pseudo - bayesian typing approach , but use a single detection with observations in three filters , rather than multiple detections with observation in ( typically ) two filters as in ku08 .",
    "although our results generally agree with all three previous studies ( ku08 , d08 , g11 ) , it is interesting to compare in more detail the assumptions used in each study . here",
    "we focus specifically on differences in the assumed extinction distribution , which we find to be the dominant systematic . unlike systematic uncertainties arising from sn typing , systematic uncertainty due to assumptions about sn properties",
    "will be common between rate studies , potentially leading to a systematic offset between results if different assumptions are used in different studies .",
    "for example , our results appear very similar to d08 in the two mid - redshift bins ( within 10% in both bins ) .",
    "however , d08 assume a different extinction distribution in their simulations than we do .",
    "if we assume the same distribution ( extinction model a ) , our derived rates in these two bins are 1.61 and 1.99 @xmath172  @xmath173 , compared to 1.30 and 1.32 @xmath172  @xmath173 in d08 .",
    "( conversely , if d08 had used the k09 extinction model , their rates would have been lower than ours . ) in other words , we actually found more sne  ia than one would have predicted based on d08 ( but not inconsistently so given the large poisson uncertainties ) .",
    "note that d08 also compare models a , b and c in assessing their systematic uncertainty but do not find the large differences that we find here .",
    "they find that model b produces rates that are @xmath174 lower than model a ( only @xmath23@xmath175 in the highest redshift bin ) , and that model c has even less of an effect , whereas we find that the difference beyond models a and b is approximately 26% in the central two bins .",
    "these different findings regarding the systematic uncertainty due to extinction are surprising given that both studies are based on hst searches the same band to similar depths .",
    "one possible explanation is the difference in cadence ( @xmath2323  days here versus @xmath2345  days in goods ) .",
    "we checked the impact of a longer cadence by rerunning our simulations ignoring every other epoch in our search .",
    "we find that the effect of different extinction distributions is unchanged to within a few percent .",
    "that is , the shorter @xmath2323  day cadence is not significantly more sensitive to highly reddened sne than the @xmath2345  day cadence .",
    "the slight enhancement in reach that a short cadence affords is insignificant compared to the long @xmath60 tail of , for example , model a. it is possible that the difference in estimated systematic uncertainty could arise from some other detail of the efficiency simulations , but a full resimulation of the d08 efficiency calculations is beyond the scope of this paper .    in table",
    "[ table : comparerates ] we have recomputed our rates using extinction assumptions similar to d08 , ku08 and g11 . ku08 use only two discrete values for @xmath60 .",
    "the values , 0.0 and 0.4 , are relatively small , so we compare using our `` minimal dust '' model . g11 use the distribution of n06 ( model c ) with a @xmath176513% correction in the redshift range @xmath177 as discussed earlier (  [ sec : hizdust ] ) .",
    "table  [ table : comparerates ] serves two purposes : ( 1 ) it aids direct comparison between each of these studies and our result , and ( 2 ) it illustrates how much the assumed extinction distribution affects our result .    in light of the large systematic differences due to dust , it is vitally important to use caution when comparing rate results from studies that use different dust assumptions . in particular , systematic offsets from dust assumptions could affect the shape of the derived sn  ia delay time distribution .",
    "the dtd shape is obtained not from the sn rate itself , but from the change in the rate with redshift ( see , for example , figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to measure the change , one typically must compare surveys covering different redshift ranges",
    "comparing low- and high - redshift measurements that correct their rates using different extinction distributions will induce a systematic error on the slope of the sn rate and thereby the dtd shape .",
    "to avoid such a systematic bias , studies of the dtd should strive to use consistent extinction corrections between low and high redshift . to aid this",
    ", we have provided our rates calculated under a variety of extinction assumptions .",
    "consitency will go a long way towards reducing potential errors in the dtd , even if the extinction distribution remains poorly known . however , in the long run one would like a better understanding of sn extinction distributions at both low and high redshift , particularly to avoid uncertainties due to a _ changing _ extinction distribution with redshift .",
    "the prospects for directly detecting the highly extincted sne are not great : even with a deep ir search , most sne with @xmath178 will be missed at high redshift .",
    "the alternative is more precise updated modeling of sn  ia extinction in the vein of @xcite or @xcite that takes into account factors such as the evolution of extinction with delay time and our latest knowledge of the sn  ia dtd .      in this paper",
    "we have computed volumetric sn  ia rates based on 189 _ hst _ orbits .",
    "this large _ hst _ dataset adds statistics to the existing _ hst _ rate measurements , previously based only on the goods fields .",
    "our results provide additional strong evidence that the sn  ia rate is @xmath179  @xmath173 yr@xmath4 mpc@xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "the availability of raw data from our efficiency simulations makes it simple to combine this dataset with current and future _ hst _ datasets , such as the 902-orbit cosmic assembly near - ir deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for even greater statistical gains .",
    "we find that an important systematic uncertainty in our result is the amount of host - galaxy dust assumed in our simulations .",
    "this illustrates the need to use caution in comparing sn rate results from different surveys , especially as statistical uncertainty decreases and systematic uncertainties become dominant .",
