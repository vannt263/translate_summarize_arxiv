    "the trend however reverses for the upper mode - edge as t is increased ( [ fig12](b ) , dark dashed lines ) .",
    "this is because the total se rate inside the upper mode - edge is always greater than outside for the highest temperatures considered in the plot .",
    "the feeding ratios increase almost by a factor of 10 ( fig .",

    "the phonon modified se rate @xmath57 is around 2 @xmath310ev ( t = 40 k ) in the interesting regions outside the waveguide band , which is much smaller than @xmath296 .",
    "thus the line - width of a qd is dominated by pure dephasing and do not change much as the qd frequency is scanned across the waveguide . hence the intensity ratios are always stronger when the qd is to the right of a mode - edge , because phonon emission is stronger than absorption .",
    "in summary , we have provided an in - depth study of the incoherent emission spectra from qds coupled to structured photonic reservoirs .",

    "<S> electron - phonon coupling in semiconductor quantum dots plays a significant role in determining the optical properties of excited excitons , especially the spectral nature of emitted photons . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a comprehensive theory and analysis of emission spectra from artificial atoms or quantum dots coupled to structured photon reservoirs and acoustic phonons , when excited with incoherent pump fields . as specific examples of structured reservoirs , we chose a lorentzian cavity and a coupled cavity waveguide , which are of current experimental interest . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of optical cavities , we directly compare and contrast the spectra from three distinct theoretical approaches to treat electron - phonon coupling , including a markovian polaron master equation , a non - markovian phonon correlation expansion technique and a semiclassical linear susceptibility approach , and we point out the limitations of these models . for the cavity - qed polaron master equation , we give closed form analytical solutions to the phonon - assisted scattering rates in the weak excitation approximation , fully accounting for temperature , cavity - exciton detuning and cavity dot coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we show explicitly why the semiclassical linear susceptibility approach fails to correctly account for phonon - mediated cavity feeding . for weakly coupled cavities </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the optical spectra using a more general reservoir approach and explain its differences from the above approaches in the low q limit of a lorentzian cavity . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently use this general reservoir to calculate the emission spectra from quantum dots coupled to slow - light photonic crystal waveguides , which demonstrate a number of striking photon - phonon coupling effects . </S>",
    "<S> our quantum theory can be applied to a wide range of photonic structures including photonic molecules and coupled - cavity waveguide systems . </S>"
