    "recently , the dipole - dipole interaction in bose - einstein condensates has generated significant theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the long - range character and the anisotropic nature of the interaction between magnetic or electric dipoles will lead to many interesting new phenomena like novel quantum phase transitions @xcite , dipolar order @xcite and spin tunnelling @xcite in the condensate .",
    "new questions concerning stability @xcite and tunability of the interaction @xcite of such a condensate arise . in most of the recent work ,",
    "the interaction between dipoles is treated as completely elastic . however , in a typical experiment aimed at the creation of a bose - einstein condensate , the atoms are held in a magnetic trap in the energetically highest magnetic sub - level . therefore , inelastic dipolar relaxation processes in which the atomic spin flips and the zeeman energy is released can not _ a priori _ be neglected .",
    "most of the above proposals require a large dipole moment like the one of a polar molecule in an electric field . in this paper , we show theoretically and experimentally that already for chromium with a magnetic moment of 6@xmath0 heating and atom loss due to dipolar relaxation is so significant that it is impossible to reach bose - einstein condensation by the standard procedure of rf - evaporation in a magnetic trap .    using a simple model which only takes into account the dipolar interaction and",
    "neglects all other aspects of the molecular interaction on the scattering process we are able to explain the observed dipolar relaxation rate in ultra - cold @xmath4cr .",
    "qualitatively , we find the same behavior for @xmath5cr .",
    "this gives strong evidence that , in the absence of resonant behavior , inelastic collisions due to dipolar relaxation can be treated in a very general way .",
    "as a consequence of maxwell s equations it is impossible to create a maximum of a static magnetic field in a region where external currents are absent . for this reason atoms are usually magnetically trapped in the energetically highest zeeman sub - level ( weak - field - seeking state ) .",
    "the trap lifetime of these atoms is mainly limited by collisions . aside from background gas collisions and three - body recombination ,",
    "the atoms undergo spin - exchange and dipolar relaxation collisions .",
    "in contrast to spin - exchange collisions , where the total spin is conserved , the spin is flipped in a dipolar relaxation process since dipole - dipole interaction does not preserve the total spin , but rather the total angular momenta .",
    "therefore , if one considers a cloud of fully polarized atoms in the energetically highest state , only spin relaxation which does not conserve the total spin leads to atom loss from the magnetic trap .    here , we estimate the inelastic cross sections for spin - flip transitions due to the magnetic spin - dipole spin - dipole interaction using fermi s golden rule . a similar form of this approximation , equivalent to the born approximation , has already been considered in @xcite , for calculating the dipolar relaxation rates of meta - stable triplet helium . in particular , in @xcite it is shown that the bare born approximation is reasonably consistent with the distorted - wave approximation which is a true first order calculation . because of the small dipole - dipole coupling in polarized triplet helium ( @xmath6 ) , the latter is considered to be an almost exact approach .    for chromium , the situation is slightly different because the magnetic coupling is larger .",
    "a first order calculation , in the form of the born approximation , provides us with an approximate analytical tool for the interpretation of the experimental results , but may not be expected to be as accurate as in the case of metastable helium .",
    "we consider for simplicity the case of two identical atoms trapped in the energetically highest sub - level of the zeeman manifold .",
    "moreover , we consider the case of zero electronic angular momenta @xmath7 such that the magnetic interaction solely arises from the electronic spin . the long range part of the interaction between two atomic magnetic dipole moments @xmath8 and @xmath9 located at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the two spin matrices , reads @xmath14 here we have introduced the interatomic separation @xmath15 with @xmath16 and the magnetic permeability of the vacuum @xmath17 .",

    "we have in mind the specific case of @xmath4cr atoms in the electronic ground state , magnetically trapped in the highest zeeman sub - level . for @xmath4cr , both the nuclear spin and the electron orbital momentum vanish ( i=0 , l=0 ) , and only the electron spin is finite ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "the initial density for both isotopes is roughly @xmath162@xmath163 . ]    here , the temperature was derived from the @xmath164 width @xmath165 of the cloud .",
    "equally high heating rates ( @xmath166@xmath138ks@xmath3 ) yielding the same loss coefficient can be observed for both clouds prepared with the same initial atom number density of @xmath167atoms/@xmath113 .",
    "the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isotopes ] indicate that the loss due to dipolar relaxation is independent of the details of the interatomic potential .",
    "since the scattering length for @xmath168 and @xmath169 differs significantly @xcite one would expect that any effect due to the molecular interaction also differs for the two isotopes .",
    "we have presented three different methods to obtain the dipolar relaxation rate constant in magnetically trapped clouds of chromium atoms . using these methods",
    "we have measured the dependence of the rate constant on the magnetic offset field of the trapping potential .",
    "we find a typical dipolar relaxation rate constants of @xmath170@xmath113s@xmath3 at a magnetic offset field of b@xmath171 g .",
    "thus , even at low magnetic fields , the loss coefficient for chromium is one order of magnitude larger than the one reported for cs in lowest hyperfine level ( f=3 ) @xcite and another 3 orders of magnitude larger than in na @xcite .",
    "a theoretical estimation of the inelastic cross sections for spin - flip transitions due to the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction , predicts cross sections for single and double spin flip transition which scale with the total angular momentum to the third and second power , respectively .",
    "the values predicted by the calculation are in good agreement with the experimentally observed values .",
    "the influence of the molecular potential on the dipolar relaxation cross section for chromium was found to be insignificant .",
    "our findings could be especially important for experiments which aim at producing high density samples of atoms and molecules with high magnetic or electric dipole moments in magnetostatic or electrostatic traps @xcite .",
    "large inelastic two - body collision rates are to be expected with increasing dipole - dipole interaction , if atoms are not trapped in the lowest energy state of the dipole .",
    "as has already been pointed out in @xcite dipolar relaxation can be almost totally suppressed by polarizing the sample in the energetic lowest spin state , which requires different trapping schemes . in this state neither dipolar relaxation nor spin exchange collisions are possible at reasonable offset field .",
    "the only expected loss mechanism in this case is three - body recombination . however , because of the long - range nature of the dipole potential the latter could also be increased compared to atoms with a small dipole moment . as a quite general conclusion , strong dipolar gases can only be cooled to degeneracy in traps that keep the dipole moment in its lowest energy state .    our results , though not promising at first glance , will help us to develop a strategy for reaching bose - einstein condensation even under the special conditions set by the large magnetic moment of chromium . in cesium ,",
    "losses due to inelastic collisions in a magnetic trap have prevented bose - einstein condensation for a long time in a similar way as in the chromium case .",
    "however , a careful study of the nature of the inelastic losses has finally allowed to devise a successful strategy for condensation @xcite .",
