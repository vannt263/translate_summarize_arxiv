    "the high energy resolution and signal - to - noise provided by current x - ray telescopes has led to reports of narrow absorption lines in the spectra of black hole systems .",
    "these features , assumed to arise from iron ( @xmath2 ) can be highly redshifted ( e.g. turner 2002 , 2004 ; dadina 2005 ; nandra 1999 , 2007 ; longinotti 2007 ; pounds 2003a , 2005 ) or blueshifted ( e.g. nandra 2007 ; dadina 2005 ; pounds 2003b ; reeves 2009 ) .",
    "many of these features are transient and their actual existence have been called into question on statistical grounds ( e.g. vaughan & uttley 2008 ) .",
    "others are persistent in that they have been identified in subsequent observations or with other instruments .",
    "these features are normally unresolved with current ccds , constraining their widths to be less than a few hundred electon volts .",
    "the most common explanation is that these features originate in high - velocity outflows and inflows ( see cappi 2006 for a review ) in some cases reaching speeds in excess of @xmath3 ( e.g. reeves 2009 ; tombesi 2010 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation for the redshifted features are resonant absorption lines due to highly ionised iron that arise naturally in the accretion disc ( ruszkowski & fabian 2000 ) .",
    "a hot and diffuse plasma located above the accretion disc will imprint resonant absorption lines on the reflection spectrum as it emerges from the disc .",
    "the medium is rotating with the accretion disc thus experiences the same dynamical effects as material in the disc . here",
    "we show that both redshifted and blueshifted features can occur and potentially shift features to apparently high velocities without the need to invoke high - velocity outflows .",
    "this is a proof of concept work where we examine the possibility that resonant absorption by highly ionised iron could account for the narrow features over a wide range of energies by making use of the velocities already present in the disc .",
    "detailed computational modelling is left to future work .",
    "it is certainly plausible that narrow absorption features close to @xmath4 are due to highly ionised outflows .",
    "however , we consider that alternative explanations for the wide range of velocities reported need to be investigated . in the following section we present the general picture and motivation for the study . in section 3",
    "we describe the potential features that would appear depending on the geometry of the system .",
    "we discuss our results in section 4 .",
    "we adopt the standard accretion disc picture that has developed over recent years .",
    "the optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disc is illuminated by a primary power law emitter that is located on the spin axis of the black hole ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] left panel ) .",
    "we note that the location of the primary emitter is arbitrary and does not need to be on the spin axis of the black hole , however from recent x - ray studies ( e.g. wilkins & fabian 2011 ) and gravitational microlensing observations of agns ( e.g. chartas 2009 ) we know the primary emitter must be compact and centrally concentrated .    located above the accretion disc is an optically thin , highly ionised plasma that is corotating with the disc .",
    "the reflection spectrum ( i.e. reflection continuum and fluorescent lines , ross & fabian 2005 ) emitted from the disc will cross through the plasma and may be subject to resonant absorption as it emerges from the disc .",
    "since the absorbing material is corotating with the disc the resonant absorption features are subject to the same kinematic and gravitational effects influencing the reflection spectrum .",
    "various lines - of - sight could influence the significance of the resonant features as the optical depth through the absorbing medium changes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] left panel ) .",
    "this will alter the depth of the feature as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] ( right panel ) .    as a simple test to examine if such a model could reproduce narrow absorption features in the appropriate energy band we considered the observed energies of the red and blue peaks of an intrinsically narrow absorption profile ( gaussian ) at the rest energy of h - like iron (  ly@xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the line is broadened by doppler and relativistic effects using the kerrconv model in xspec ( brenneman & reynolds 2006 ) for a black hole spin parameter of @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] ) . depending on the inclination of the disc , features attributed to narrow  absorption could appear anywhere from @xmath8 to over @xmath9 .",
    "the energy range could expand to even lower energies if one considers absorption by  ( @xmath10 ) or higher energies if one considers  ly@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "in this section we consider various geometries of the model in sect .",
    "[ sect : picture ] and examine the appearance of the absorption imprinted on the reflection spectrum .",
    "the direct component of the primary emitter viewed by the observer is not absorbed by the plasma .",
    "we assume the hot atmosphere is highly ionised and consider resonant absorption only from hydrogen - like (  ly@xmath5 ) and helium - like ( ) iron .",
    "the scattering is treated as simple line absorption , that is once the photon is scattered out of the line of sight it is neglected . when considering two lines , for simplicity we treat both features as equally strong .",
    "we adopt a modest agn spectrum for our trials .",
    "the power law photon index is @xmath13 .",
    "the disc is ionised with @xmath14 and solar iron abundances ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "the inner and outer disc edges are set at @xmath15 ( @xmath16  gmc@xmath17 ) and @xmath18 , respectively , and the emissivity index for the disc is @xmath19 . for each case",
    "considered , we simulate the appearance the spectrum could have when viewed during a @xmath20 exposure with the  pn detector .",
    "the @xmath0 flux is @xmath21 .",
    "the simulated spectra and models are shown in the agn rest - frame .",
    "the first case examined builds on the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] .",
    "we consider an accretion disc that is blanketed by the ionised plasma .",
    "the plasma has a line optical depth of @xmath22 at all radii and is irradiated with the same emissivity profile as the disc .",
    "[ fig : blanket ] depicts the spectrum for a plasma made up of h - like iron ( left panel ) and both h- and he - like iron ( right panel ) resonant absorption at different line - of - sight inclinations .    as seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : blanket ] such features can be shifted and appear significantly broad and deep as they blend with the iron absorption edge at 7.1 kev . in the case of  absorption",
    "viewed at 60 degrees inclination , the feature can be redshifted well over @xmath23 in the rest frame . in fig .",
    "[ fig : simblanket ] we demonstrate how such a feature may appear in an  pn observation after one has presumable modelled the reflection spectrum correctly .",
    "if absorption were attributed to  and , the situation would resemble the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : blanket ] .",
    "the lines would be blended due to relativistic broadening of each and would not be distinguished as two features .      in this and section  [",
    "sect : xvar ] we still adopt the lamppost model described above , but consider the situation in which the absorption is enhanced in a certain region above the disc effectively forming an annulus of absorbing material .",
    "this could originate from a hot spot above the disc illuminating a certain region , or anisotropies in disc leading to increased concentration of hot plasma , or enhanced structure in the disc that amplifies the reflection continuum . in the simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ringi ] , the absorption is localised between @xmath24 from the black hole and viewed at different inclinations . depending on the inclination , significant absorption lines can be seen between @xmath25 in the rest - frame .",
    "detectable features are predicted in the  pn simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : simringi ] ) .",
    "the final situation examined corresponds to an absorbing annulus at various distances from the black hole . at distances less than @xmath26",
    "the absorption profile is rather blurred ( see also section  [ sect : ivar ] ) , but as the distance increases and general relativistic effects are less dominant , doppler effects prevail and the line profiles begins to take on the inverted disc line appearance . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ringd ] , we examine a disc inclined 30 degrees with absorption coming from different distances .",
    "the double - peaked profile becomes apparent at distances beyond @xmath27 .",
    "the blue edge of the profile is driven by the inclination of the disc and is shifted to higher energies as the disc inclination increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] ) . the simulation in fig .",
    "[ fig : simringd ] depicts  absorption from a ring between @xmath28 .",
    "the single feature could easily mimic multiple absorption features .",
    "we examine the possibility that narrow absorption features regularly observed in the spectra of agn and attributed to fast , ionised inflows and outflows , could arise naturally from resonant absorption of the reflection spectrum making use of velocities already present in the disc .",
    "we consider various geometries ( e.g. rings and blankets ) for the hot plasma that is corotating with the accretion disc and subject to the same kinematic and relativistic effects as the reflection spectrum . in all cases ,",
    "we demonstrate that absorption features could be easily detected between @xmath29 in typical  observations .",
    "we note that the observed energy range could be significantly expanded by adding the contribution of other transitions ( e.g.  ly@xmath11 at @xmath12 ) .",
    "notable from the simulations in section 3 is that the absorption features are not genuinely narrow , but have significant width .",
    "however , the ccd resolution provide by current instruments limits our ability to distinguish features narrower than a few hundred ev . calorimeter observations with _ astro - h _ and _ athena _ will likely be capable of resolving such features and thereby distinguishing models .",
    "the work here is highly simplified and we only consider resonant absorption by  and .",
    "more complicated situations , in which elemental abundances are non - solar ( or variable ) and/or there exists greater diversity in composition of the plasma are easy to envision . line of sight effects are also treated simply here .",
    "if there is a composition gradient , in the atmosphere then long sight lines through the hot plasma ( e.g. low inclinations ) can produces very complicated spectra with many features ( e.g. the spectrum of the x - ray binary gro j165540 , miller 2008 ) .",
    "long sight lines will also mean that different species experience different blurring effects and a specific species will be associated with a specific distance from the black hole .",
    "the purpose of this work was to demonstrate a concept leaving more complex situations for further study .",
