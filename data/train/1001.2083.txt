    "the chemical evolution of the universe is driven by the nucleosynthesis of elements in stars . evolved stars return a significant fraction of their mass to the interstellar medium .",
    "this matter is enriched with heavy elements which were produced in the stellar interior and dredged - up to the surface by convective motions . for quantitative modeling of galactic chemical evolution",
    "it is crucial to know the stellar yields of chemical elements , i.e. , how much metals are produced by which stars .",
    "yields are computed from stellar evolution models , however , several uncertainties in modeling can strongly affect the yields . among the most serious problems",
    "are mixing processes ( convection ) and some particular nuclear reaction rates .",
    "one solution to these problems is a comparison of predicted surface abundances with observations .",
    "quantitative spectroscopy is therefore a powerful tool to calibrate free modeling parameters , e.g. , those associated with convective overshoot .",
    "this paper is restricted to evolved low - mass stars , or to be more precise , to hot post - agb stars .",
    "about 95% of all stars in our galaxy end their life as a white dwarf .",
    "these low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath018@xmath1 ) roughly produce 50% of the metal yields , mainly during the phase of agb evolution in combination with strong radiatively - driven mass loss .",
    "we demonstrate here that quantitative abundance analyses of particular elements in post - agb stars provide valuable insight into agb - star nucleosynthesis processes .",
    "we further confine our paper to very hot _ hydrogen - deficient _ post - agb stars .",
    "the reason is that these particular objects offer the unique possibility to directly access the nucleosynthesis products .",
    "why do we concentrate on hot stars , i.e. , those having @xmath0100000k ? this is because the spectra of cooler objects are wind - contaminated .",
    "these are the wolf - rayet type central stars of planetary nebulae and their atmospheres are much more difficult to model .",
    "in addition , very weak spectral features from rare elements can be smeared out by atmospheric motion and become undetectable .",
    "we also exclude from our studies hot white dwarfs and subdwarf o / b stars , because their nucleosynthesis history was wiped out by diffusion effects in their atmospheres .",
    "we report on our work on pg1159 stars , a group of 40 extremely hot hydrogen - deficient post - agb stars @xcite . their effective temperatures ( ) range between 75000200000  k. many of them",
    "are still heating up along the constant - luminosity part of their post - agb evolutionary path in the hrd ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) but most of them are already fading along the hot end of the white dwarf cooling sequence ( with @xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath3 ) . luminosities and masses are inferred from spectroscopically determined  and surface gravity ( ) by comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks . the position of analysed pg1159 stars in the `` observational hr diagram '' , i.e. the   diagram , are displayed in fig.[fighrd ] .",
    "the high - luminosity stars have low  ( @xmath05.5 ) while the low - luminosity stars have a high surface gravity ( @xmath07.5 ) that is typical for white dwarf ( wd ) stars .",
    "the derived masses of pg1159 stars have a mean of 0.62@xmath1 , a value that is practically identical to the mean mass of wds .",
    "the pg1159 stars co - exist with hot central stars of planetary nebulae and the hottest hydrogen - rich ( da ) white dwarfs in the same region of the hr diagram . about every other pg1159 star is surrounded by an old , extended planetary nebula .        what is the characteristic feature that discerns pg1159 stars from `` usual '' hot central stars and hot wds ?",
    "spectroscopically , it is the lack of hydrogen balmer lines , pointing at a h - deficient surface chemistry .",
    "the proof of h - deficiency , however , is not easy : the stars are very hot , h is strongly ionized and the lack of balmer lines could simply be an ionisation effect .",
    "in addition , every balmer line is blended by a pickering line of ionized helium .",
    "hence , only detailed modeling of the spectra can give reliable results on the photospheric composition .",
    "the high effective temperatures require non - lte modeling of the atmospheres .",
    "such models for h - deficient compositions have only become available in the early 1990s after new numerical techniques have been developed and computers became capable enough .",
    "the first quantitative spectral analyses of optical spectra from pg1159 stars indeed confirmed their h - deficient nature @xcite .",
    "it could be shown that the main atmospheric constituents are c , he , and o. the typical abundance pattern is c=0.50 , he=0.35 , o=0.15 ( mass fractions ) .",
    "it was speculated that these stars exhibit intershell matter on their surface , however , the c and o abundances were much higher than predicted from stellar evolution models .",
    "it was further speculated that the h - deficiency is caused by a late he - shell flash , suffered by the star during post - agb evolution , laying bare the intershell layers .",
    "the re - ignition of he - shell burning brings the star back onto the agb , giving rise to the designation `` born - again '' agb star @xcite .",
    "if this scenario is true , then the intershell abundances in the models have to be brought into agreement with observations . by introducing a more effective overshoot prescription for the he - shell flash convection during thermal pulses on the agb , dredge - up of carbon and oxygen into the intershell can achieve this agreement @xcite .",
    "another strong support for the born - again scenario was the detection of neon lines in optical spectra of some pg1159 stars @xcite .",
    "the abundance analysis revealed ne=0.02 , which is in good agreement with the ne intershell abundance in the improved stellar models .",
    "if we accept the hypothesis that pg1159 stars display former intershell matter on their surface , then we can in turn use these stars as a tool to investigate intershell abundances of other elements .",
    "therefore , these stars offer the unique possibility to directly see the outcome of nuclear reactions and mixing processes in the intershell of agb stars . usually the intershell is kept hidden below a thick h - rich stellar mantle and the only chance to obtain information about intershell processes",
    "is the occurrence of the 3rd dredge - up .",
    "this indirect view of intershell abundances makes the interpretation of the nuclear and mixing processes difficult , because the abundances of the dredged - up elements may have been changed by additional burning and mixing processes in the h - envelope ( e.g. , hot - bottom burning ) .",
    "in addition , stars with an initial mass below 1.5  @xmath1  do not experience a 3rd dredge - up at all .",
    "we note that the central stars of planetary nebulae of spectral type [ wc ] are believed to be immediate progenitors of pg1159 stars , representing the evolutionary phase between the early post - agb and pg1159 stages .",
    "this is based on spectral analyses of [ wc ] stars which yield very similar abundance results @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss the [ wc ] stars here because the analyses of trace elements are much more difficult or even impossible due to strong line broadening in their rapidly expanding atmospheres .",
    "the course of events after the final he - shell flash is qualitatively different depending on the moment when the flash starts .",
    "we speak about a very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) when it occurs in a wd , i.e. the star has turned around the `` knee '' in the hr diagram and h - shell burning has already stopped ( fig.[fig : hrd ] ) .",
    "the star expands and develops a h - envelope convection zone that eventually reaches deep enough that h - burning sets in ( a so - called hydrogen - ingestion flash ) .",
    "hence h is destroyed and whatever h abundance remains , it will probably be shed from the star during the `` born - again '' agb phase . a late thermal pulse ( ltp ) denotes the occurrence of the final flash in a post - agb star that is still burning hydrogen , i.e.",
    ", it is on the horizontal part of the post - agb track , before the `` knee '' .",
    "in contrast to the vltp case , the bottom of the developing h - envelope convection zone does not reach deep enough layers to burn h. the h - envelope ( having a mass of about @xmath6  @xmath1 ) is mixed with a few times @xmath7  @xmath1  intershell material , leading to a dilution of h down to about h=0.02 , which is below the spectroscopic detection limit . if the final flash occurs immediately before the star departs from the agb , then we talk about an aftp ( agb final thermal pulse ) .",
    "in contrast to an ordinary agb thermal pulse the h - envelope mass is particularly small .",
    "like in the ltp case , h is just diluted with intershell material and not burned .",
    "the remaining h abundance is relatively high , well above the detection limit ( h @xmath5 0.1 ) .",
    "there are three objects , from which we believe to have witnessed a ( very ) late thermal pulse during the last @xmath0100 years .",
    "fg  sge suffered a late flash in 1894 @xcite .",
    "the star became rich in c and rare earth elements .",
    "it most probably was hit by an ltp , not a vltp , because it turned h - deficient only recently ( if at all , this is still under debate ) . as of today ,",
    "fg  sge is located on or close to the agb .",
    "v605  aql experienced a vltp in 1917 @xcite .",
    "since then , it has quickly evolved back towards the agb , began to reheat and is now in its second post - agb phase .",
    "it has now an effective temperature of the order 100000  k and is h - deficient .",
    "sakurai s object ( v4334  sgr ) also experienced a vltp , starting around 1993 @xcite .",
    "it quickly evolved back to the agb and became h - deficient .",
    "recent observations indicate that the reheating of the star already began , i.e. , its second departure from the agb might just have begun .",
    "the spectroscopic study of fg  sge and sakurai s object is particularly interesting , because we can observe how the surface abundances change with time .",
    "the stars are still cool , so that isotopic ratios can be studied from molecule lines @xcite and abundances of many metals can be determined .",
    "the situation is less favorable with the hot pg1159 stars : all elements are highly ionised and for many of them no atomic data are available for quantitative analyses . on the other hand , in the cool",
    "born - again stars the he - intershell material is once again partially concealed .",
    "abundance analyses of pg1159 stars are performed by detailed fits to spectral line profiles . because of the high  all species are highly ionized and , hence , most metals are only accessible by uv spectroscopy",
    ". optical spectra always exhibit lines from and .",
    "only the hottest pg1159 stars display additional lines of n , o , and ne ( , , ) . for all other species",
    "we have utilized high - resolution uv spectra that were taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) .",
    "fuse allowed observations in the lyman - uv range ( @xmath09001200   ) that is not accessible with hst , and this turned out to be essential for most results reported here .",
    "a number of chemical elements could be identified ( f , p , s , ar ) .",
    "in addition , very high ionisation stages of several elements , which were never seen before in stellar photospheric spectra , could be identified in the uv spectra for the very first time ( e.g. , , ) . to illustrate this , we display in figs .",
