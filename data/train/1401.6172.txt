    "we will use the following definitions : a level-@xmath30 cayley tree of coordination number @xmath24 is constructed recursively by connecting a root site to @xmath58 identical level-@xmath59 trees  until level @xmath60 is reached .",

    "wired _ boundary conditions which we will consider here are equivalent to establishing additional connections between all boundary sites  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the free boundary conditions correspond to the leaves having only a single neighbor , the one at the next level .",
    "we write the partition function of the two - color percolation problem for a level-@xmath30 cayley tree ( here we present the case of @xmath31 ) as a sum of contributions corresponding to the ` fate ' of its root site : @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 account for all configurations in which the root site at level @xmath30 is , respectively , empty or belongs to a finite uninfected / infected , giant uninfected ( @xmath66 ) or giant infected ( @xmath67 ) cluster .",
    "we call a cluster _ infected _ if it contains a single red site ; a cluster is referred to as _ giant _ if it contains both the root and a boundary site , or as _ finite _ otherwise . by attaching two level-@xmath30 trees to a new root site at level @xmath68 and denoting @xmath69",
    "we arrive at the following recursion relations @xmath70,\\\\ i_{k+1}&=\\tilde{p}\\left[2i_{k}h_{k}+2u_{k } h_{k } + 2u_{k } f^\\text{i}_{k } + u_{k}^2+i_{k}^2\\right ] , \\end{split } \\label{eq : cayley_recursion}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a priori probability of site being occupied and colored red or green as follows from the main text .",
    "note that the term containing @xmath71 in the last line implies , somewhat counterintuitively , that two giant infected clusters can be merged .",
    "in fact , this is a consequence of the wired boundary conditions : these are two parts of the _ same _ cluster which are already connected via boundary sites .",
    "essentially , wired boundaries imply that there may only exist a single giant cluster . for the same reason , no @xmath72 terms are possible .",
    "( note that this situation is reversed for free boundary conditions . )",
    "the partition function of a @xmath73-level tree is @xmath74 we define @xmath75 and @xmath76 to be probabilities that the root site of a large tree is connected to its boundary via an uninfected and infected clusters respectively .",
    "if @xmath33 , the only real solution of the resulting equations is @xmath77  in other words , there is no percolation .",
    "if @xmath35 , however , two additional solutions emerge : @xmath78 as has been pointed in the main text , the fact that @xmath79 remains zero even after the onset of percolation is rather obvious since the probability of a large cluster to remain uninfected tends to zero with its size .    in the same manner",
    "we can compute other quantities such as the probability of a given site being empty @xmath80 , as well well as being occupied and belonging to either an uninfected or infected finite cluster , @xmath81 .",
    "if there is no percolation ( @xmath82 ) , these expressions are given by @xmath83 above the percolation threshold , @xmath84 , the expressions become rather cumbersome : @xmath85\\nonumber\\\\ p^{\\text{i}}_\\text{f}&=&\\frac{3 \\tilde{p}\\mp\\sqrt{\\tilde{p}\\left(9 \\tilde{p}-4\\right ) } -\\sqrt{2 } \\theta_{\\pm}(\\tilde{p})}{4 \\tilde{p } } \\label{eq : cayley_prob2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 these solutions are used in the derivation of the corresponding probabilities for the @xmath24-regular random graph .      using the cavity method we can now obtain the results for the full - space @xmath24-regular random graph . in the cavity method",
    "the addition of a bulk site or edge is equivalent to connecting @xmath24 or @xmath25 roots of independent level-@xmath30 cayley trees ( see figure  [ fig : bethe ] ) in the main text ) . in other words",
    "the bulk site or edge of @xmath24-regular random graph is equivalent to the central site or edge of a uniform bethe lattice .",
    "the quantities for the site - centered case , analogous to those given by eqs .",
    "( s[eq : cayley_recursion ] ) for a rooted tree , can be written as @xmath87 where we have discounted all configurations where the giant cluster is uninfected  we have already seen that they have vanishing relative contribution .",
    "the partition function is then @xmath88    another way of constructing a uniform lattice is by adding an edge between two root sites of cayley trees .",
    "the corresponding quantities in this case become : @xmath89 the meaning of these quantities in the case of edge addition is as follows : @xmath90 is the number of all configurations where each of the ( former root ) sites connected by the new edge was either empty or belonged to a finite uninfected cluster ; @xmath91 counts all configurations where one of these sites belonged to a finite infected cluster while the other was either empty or a part of a finite uninfected cluster ; @xmath92 counts configurations where either one or both sites belonged to a giant ( infected ) cluster . once again",
    ", we discount the configurations where the giant cluster is uninfected . the corresponding partition function is @xmath93    using these quantities , we can calculate various probabilities in the same fashion as in the previous section for the root site ",
    "see eqs .",

    "note that the value of parameter @xmath94 at which the percolation solution",
    "@xmath95 first emerges is not affected by such calculation , albeit the value of the percolation probability itself changes : @xmath96 .",
    "the importance of merging the rooted cayley trees into a bethe lattice in these two different ways will become clear in the next section dedicated to calculating the free energy .",
    "this will allow us to circumvent the inherent problem of evaluating extensive thermodynamic potentials on the bethe lattice , where the number of boundary sites is a finite fraction of the total system .",
    "in contrast with continuous phase transitions , first order transitions do not occur when the non - trivial solution for the order parameter first appears as this normally signifies only the emergence of a _",
    "metastable _ state .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the actual transition point in this case , one needs to study the free energy ; the transition occurs when the free energy associated with an ordered state becomes smaller than that for the disordered state .",
    "this seemingly straightforward test becomes problematic on a bethe lattice due to the aforementioned issue of an extensive size of the boundary . while this problem had been widely discussed in the literature ",
    "see e.g.  @xcite  none of the recipes proposed there are applicable ( or even meaningful ) for the case of percolation .",
    "specifically , our percolation model is a counting problem and does not have any sensible notion of energy associated with it , hence no derivatives with respect to external fields can be used to define any thermodynamic potentials here , unlike , e.g. in the context of the potts model  @xcite .",
    "one could define the limit of the free energy per _ internal _ site following the approach of ref .",
    ", yet this quantity is not helpful either : not only is such free energy _ always _ minimized in the percolating phase , it is not even continuous across the ( putative ) transition into this phase .",
    "since the actual free energy must be continuous across any phase transitions , it is clear that the aforementioned free energy per internal site is not the right quantity to look at in our case .",
    "( naturally , the total free energy defined via the logarithm of the partition function is a continuous function of its parameters but contains an extensive boundary contribution . ) in short , the failure of this approach signifies a simple fact that the free energy can not be associated solely with an internal site or an internal bond of a bethe lattice , and the presence of an extensive boundary prevents one from meaningfully distributing its ` shares ' between them .",
    "specifically , a choice of boundary conditions ( e.g. free vs. wired ) dramatically changes the ratio between the number of bonds and the number of sites in the system .",
    "note that this issue does not arise in the context of continuous phase transitions since those always coincide with the emergence of a non - trivial solution for the order parameter .",
    "the problem with a meaningful definition of the free energy is cured by considering a @xmath24-regular random graph instead of a bethe lattice .",
    "the two are locally equivalent to one another , yet the random graph lacks a distinct boundary .",
    "this in turn fixes the bond to site ratio of in the system to @xmath97 .",
    "we can then use the prescription outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite to write the free energy per added site as @xmath98}$ ] where the first term corresponds to the the free energy of an internal site of a bethe lattice defined similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite while the second term corrects for the fact that adding a site to a @xmath24-regular graph creates @xmath24 new edges , and hence @xmath97 existing edges should be removed to maintain the graph s regularity .",
    "using expressions for @xmath99 , @xmath28 and @xmath100 given by eqs .",
    "( s[eq : partition_full ] ) and ( s[eq : bond_partition ] ) of the previous section , we find the expressions for free energy corresponding to all three solutions for @xmath101 on a @xmath102-regular random graph :      @xmath104   \\\\",

    "for example , the expected size of a cluster containing the root site but not any leaves is given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the average cluster size in non - percolating configurations , @xmath110 is the weight of corresponding configurations .",

    "the transition is first order , this quantity does not diverge at the transition @xmath112",
    ".    the cluster size distribution for a rooted tree can be obtained from the total weight of configurations where the site at level @xmath30 belongs to a finite cluster @xmath113 here @xmath114 are the weights of configurations where the root site belongs to a cluster of size @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding probabilities for a site to belong to an uninfected / infected @xmath1-site cluster are @xmath115 and may be also found from recursion relations            the cluster size distribution ( inset of figure  s[s4.fig01 ] ) has an exponential cutoff for large clusters both below and above the percolation transition .",
    "after the appearance of the giant component the cutoff discontinuously shifts to smaller cluster sizes .",

    "<S> the rules for this site percolation model are physical and very simple , requiring only the introduction of a weight @xmath0 for a cluster of size @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes that a discontinuous percolation transition can occur with qualitatively more local interactions than in all currently considered examples of explosive percolation ; and that , unlike these , it can be reversible . </S>",
    "<S> this greatly extends both the applicability of such percolation models in principle , and their reach in practice .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction . _ </S>",
    "<S> the percolation transition involves fundamentally geometric properties , manifest in non - local observables such as an onset of conductivity in a dirty metal , a breakdown of an electrical grid or an epidemic disease outbreak @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is at odds with the more standard phase transitions in statistical physics which are described by a local order parameter , such as the magnetisation in a bar magnet . </S>",
    "<S> it thus involves a conceptually fundamentally distinct set of issues . </S>",
    "<S> its wide applicability coupled with this fundamental importance have generated much interest in defining various types of percolation problems and analysing their concomitant phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> one enterprise has been the quest for a first - order percolation transition , where the percolating cluster sets in discontinuously , corresponding to a particularly violent transition , which can qualitatively amplify desirable properties in applications . </S>",
    "<S> such a transition has remained remarkably elusive , but the development which has taken place under the heading of _ explosive percolation _ has finally yielded one , via a mechanism in which an infinite number of nonlocal interactions need to occur simultaneously @xcite .    here , we study _ pauli percolation _  a site percolation problem with its origin in correlated quantum magnetism , characterized by a number of novel striking and desirable properties . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , it exhibits a first - order phase transition invoking only a minimal amount of non - locality , in the form of an interaction solely between adjacent clusters , depending only on their respective sizes . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , such an interaction can be very easily generated from perfectly local ones , for instance either via a simple classical colouring rule , or via a quantum - statistical interaction between fermionic particles . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , it describes an equilibrium phase transition , and is hence reversible ; at the same time , it can be thought of and analysed as a stochastic dynamical process and thus may  but need not  exhibit hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> finally , pauli percolation lends itself to investigations using the toolbox of equilibrium classical statistical mechanics ; we are thus able to solve its properties _ analytically _ on a regular random graph , and verify this solution via numerical monte carlo simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> _ pauli percolation . </S>",
    "<S> _    the model we consider first arose in a quantum many - body problem of itinerant electrons on lattices with flat energy bands . </S>",
    "<S> such a system can exhibit flat - band ferromagnetism : the pauli exclusion principle mandates that in the ground state the electron spins in a cluster order ferromagnetically in order to minimize the energy of repulsive on - site interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a weight of @xmath2 , reflecting the number of possible orientations of the total spin of a ferromagnetic cluster of @xmath1 electrons @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding statistical - mechanical problem describes @xmath3 particles occupying random sites of a lattice . </S>",
    "<S> every configuration @xmath4 appears with statistical weight @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the size of cluster @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function is therefore @xmath8    merging two clusters of size @xmath9 and @xmath1 reduces their overall weight from @xmath10 to @xmath11  a dramatic reduction for large clusters resulting in an effective repulsive interaction between them . </S>",
    "<S> this is reminiscent of the ` product rule ' leading to explosive percolation suggested by achlioptas @xcite and developed in @xcite but there are fundamental differences , see discussion below .    </S>",
    "<S> rather then fixing the number of occupied sites , we can study the grand canonical ensemble by letting each site of the lattice be occupied with an _ a priori _ probability @xmath12 or left empty with an a priori probability @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> note that a  priori probability @xmath12 , unlike a regular site percolation , is not equal to the density of occupied sites .    </S>",
    "<S> this model also has a simple representation as a particular classical two - color , or contagion , percolation problem . </S>",
    "<S> it is a mild variation of regular percolation : sites can come in two colors , green ( uninfected ) or red ( infected ) . specifically </S>",

    "<S> only configurations @xmath18 where every cluster contains no more than one red site are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function of this model is then simply @xmath19 it is straightforward to see that tracing over all possible site colors consistent with fixed site occupations renders eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : grandpartition1 ] ) ( with the identification of @xmath20 ) : each cluster may have either all sites green ( uninfected ) , or _ at most _ one red ( infected ) site . </S>",
    "<S> therefore a cluster of @xmath1 sites has weight @xmath21 after the sum over possible locations of red sites is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the utility of the formulation as a two - color percolation problem lies in the fact that the need ever to compute cluster sizes is obviated : the choice of location of the infected site takes care of that .    _ </S>",

    "<S> _ we show that pauli percolation exhibits a discontinuous percolation transition in infinite dimensions by studying it analytically and numerically on a regular random graph of @xmath22 sites . </S>",

    "<S> they have a vanishing density of short cycles and mostly contain loops of size @xmath23 ; hence they are locally tree - like @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this property enables us to develop an exact solution via a so - called _ cavity method _ widely used in spin </S>",

    "<S> the notion of explosive first - order percolation  @xcite has been met with much excitement , yet the initial approach proved to be deficient  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a discontinuous transition has finally been found in several variants of explosive percolation models which , however , require a very elevated degree of non - locality : a dynamical process defining these models involves a comparison between an _ extensive _ number of degrees of freedom before a configuration change occurs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies also considered suppressing the onset of percolation through a rule explicitly inhibiting bond addition if it leads to the formation of a spanning cluster @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> not only such a process involves an extensive number of local degrees of freedom , it also makes the ` microscopic ' dynamics of the model  a placement of a particular bond  explicitly depend on the onset of a global phenomenon , percolation .    </S>",
    "<S> pauli percolation , by contrast , considers one site at a time , with a minimal amount of non - locality entering only via the sizes of the clusters impinging on the site in question . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> pauli percolation is non - local only up to the size of the clusters present locally . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli principle of quantum mechanics presents a straightforward physical origin for such a weight : quantum statistical interactions are intrinsically non - local on this level . </S>",
    "<S> a classical route to the same weights involves permitting at most one site of each cluster to be infected , again a simple and intuitive description involving clusters only locally and individually .    nor does pauli percolation require the irreversibility of explosive percolation . based on statistical weights of configurations rather than rules for cluster growth , pauli percolation provides an _ equilibrium _ first - order transition . </S>",
    "<S> it in particular allows for shrinking , as well as growing , clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore naturally accommodates healing / repairing processes , in e.g. network applications which , notably , can remove percolation discontinuously . </S>",
    "<S> the growth process encoded by the `` product rule '' in explosive percolation is reminiscent of the weights of pauli percolation : the latter , however , provides a natural prescription for removing particles as well . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that another route to a reversible first - order percolation transition , although not normally thought of in these terms , is provided by the fortuin  </S>",

    "<S> , the ordering transition of the potts model corresponds to a correlated _ bond percolation _ problem . for @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 for @xmath57 ) , the ordering transition of the potts model is of first order , and hence so is the concomitant fk bond percolation transition . </S>",
    "<S> another type of percolation models with a known first order transition are so - called @xmath30-core and closely related rigidity percolation problems  @xcite . here , despite local update rules , the percolation phenomenon itself can not be detected without `` postprocessing '' , which both requires an extensive number of checks and complicates a reversible dynamical process interpretation .    </S>",
    "<S> pauli percolation can be easily generalized to a non - equilibrium growth process , e.g. by simply removing the detailed balance implied by the configuration weights , and retaining only the relative rates for particle addition . in general </S>",
    "<S> , there is a huge family of non - equilibrium prescriptions which `` generalize '' a given equilibrium distribution . the equilibrium process  besides widening the purview of applications from the exclusively non - equilibrium cases  leads to a great simplification in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it can be efficiently studied numerically on a wide range of graphs and lattices , and therefore incorporates geometric structures and inhomogeneities which may be called for in real - life applications . on sufficiently regular graphs </S>",
    "<S> , it can be studied _ exactly _ with standard analytical methods . </S>",
    "<S> this in particular obviates worries about crossovers on absurdly long lengthscales or anomalously small critical exponents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> approximations such as geometry - free prescriptions for product - rule percolation also become unnecessary .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> pauli percolation is a simple , physical , natural , transparent and tractable novel percolation problem exhibiting an intriguing phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> it holds great promise as a benchmark problem across the range of disciplines interested in percolation problems , ranging from condensed matter via biological systems and real - world networks to epidemic disease outbreaks .    </S>",
