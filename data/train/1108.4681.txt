    "strong gravitational lenses offer unique opportunities to study cosmology , dark matter , galactic structure , and galaxy evolution .",
    "they also provide a sample of galaxies , namely the lenses themselves , that are selected based on total mass rather than luminosity or surface brightness .",
    "the majority of lenses discovered in the past decade were found through dedicated surveys using a variety of techniques .",
    "for example , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data have been used to effectively select lens candidates from rich clusters @xcite through intermediate scale clusters @xcite to individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "other searches using the cfhtls @xcite and cosmos fields @xcite have yielded 40 and 70 lens candidates respectively .",
    "these searches cover the range of giant arcs with einstein radii @xmath10 all the way to small arcs produced by single lens galaxies with @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper we report on the serendipitous discovery of a strongly lensed @xmath12 galaxy in the blanco cosmology survey ( bcs ) imaging data .",
    "the lens is a rich cluster containing a prominent central brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) and has a redshift of @xmath1 .",
    "cluster - scale lenses are particularly useful as they allow us to study the effects of strong lensing in the core of the cluster and weak lensing in the outer regions .",
    "strong lensing provides constraints on the mass contained within the einstein radius of the arcs whereas weak lensing provides information on the mass profiles in the outer reaches of the cluster . combining the two measurements allows us to make tighter constraints on the mass @xmath5 and the concentration @xmath7 , of an nfw @xcite model of the cluster mass density profile , over a wider range of radii than would be possible with either method alone @xcite .",
    "in addition , if one has spectroscopic redshifts for the member galaxies one can determine the cluster velocity dispersion , assuming the cluster is virialized , and hence obtain an independent estimate for @xmath5 @xcite . finally one can also derive an @xmath5 estimate from the maxbcg cluster richness @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these three different methods , strong plus weak lensing , cluster velocity dispersion , and optical richness , provide independent estimates of @xmath5 ( @xmath5 is defined as the mass within a sphere of overdensity 200 times the critical density at the redshift @xmath3 ) and can then be combined to obtain improved constraints on @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "measurements of the concentration from strong lensing clusters is of particular interest as recent publications suggest that they may be more concentrated than one would expect from @xmath9cdm models @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : bcs_survey ] we describe the blanco cosmology survey .",
    "then in   [",
    "sec : discovery ] we discuss the initial discovery and the spectroscopic follow - up that led to confirmation of the system as a gravitational lens , the data reduction , the properties of the cluster , the extraction of the redshifts , and finally the measurement of the cluster velocity dispersion and estimate of the cluster mass . in ",

    "the blanco cosmology survey ( bcs ) is a 60-night noao imaging survey program ( 2005 - 2008 ) , using the mosaic - ii camera on the blanco 4 m telescope at ctio , that has uniformly imaged @xmath17 of the sky in the sdss @xmath18 bands in preparation for cluster finding with the south pole telescope ( spt ) @xcite and other millimeter - wave experiments .",
    "the depths in each band were chosen to allow the estimation of photometric redshifts for @xmath19 galaxies out to a redshift of @xmath20 and to detect galaxies to @xmath21 at @xmath22 to these same redshifts .",
    "the survey was divided into two fields to allow efficient use of the allotted nights between october and december .",
    "both fields lie near @xmath23 which allows for overlap with the spt .",
    "one field is centered near @xmath24 hr and the other is at @xmath25 hr .",
    "in addition to the large science fields , bcs also covers 7 small fields that overlap large spectroscopic surveys so that photometric redshifts ( photo - z s ) using bcs data can be trained and tested using a sample of over 5,000 galaxies .",
    "the lens bcs j2351 - 5452 was discovered serendipitously while examining @xmath2- and @xmath3-band images being acquired in october 2006 during the yearly bcs observing run .",

    "* and references therein ) discuss an `` orientation bias '' effect which causes an upward bias in the measured velocity dispersions of lensing - selected clusters , due to the higher likelihood of the alignment along the line of sight of the major axes of the cluster halos , which are in general triaxial .",

    "[ arc - r - band ] to study the strong lensing features of the system as it has the best seeing and hence shows the most detail . to remove the contribution to the arc fluxes from nearby objects we used galfit @xcite to model the profiles of these objects ( galaxies and stars ) and then subtracted the model from the image",
    "this was done for all four bands @xmath18 .",
    "these subtracted images are used for all determinations of arc fluxes and positions .",
    "a number of individual knots can be observed in the system along with the more elongated features .",
    "for example it appears that knot a1 is actually composed of two individual bright regions which are resolved by the sextractor object extraction described below .",
    "knot a2 also appears to have two components although these are not resolved by the object extraction so we treat them as one in the modeling .",
    "even though the cluster is fairly massive we do not see evidence for additional arc - like features outside of the central circular feature . in this case",
    "we expect the mass of the lens to be well constrained by the image positions .",
    "we use the criteria that to obtain multiple images the average surface mass density within the tangential critical curve must equal the critical surface mass density @xmath97 .",
    "the tangentially oriented arcs occur at approximately the tangential critical curves and so the radius of the circle @xmath98 traced by the arcs provides a measurement of the einstein radius @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the mass @xmath100 enclosed with the einstein radius is therfore given by @xmath101 substituting for @xmath97 gives @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the angular diameter distance to the source , @xmath104 the angular diameter distance to the lens , and @xmath105 the angular diameter distance between the lens and the source .",
    "these values are @xmath106 mpc , @xmath107 mpc and @xmath108 mpc .    to determine the einstein radius we ran sextractor @xcite on the @xmath96-band image .",
    "this identified eight distinct objects in the image .",
    "we used the coordinates of those eight objects and fit them to a circle .",
    "the radius of the circle gives us a measure of the einstein radius .",
    "the einstein radius we measure is @xmath109 which translates to @xmath110 kpc .",
    "this yields a mass estimate of @xmath111 and a corresponding velocity dispersion ( assuming an isothermal model for the mass distribution ) of @xmath112 .",
    "the magnification of the lens @xmath113 can be roughly estimated under the assumption that the 1/2-light radius of a source at redshift @xmath114 is about @xmath115 ( derived from the mock galaxy catalog described in @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of the area subtended by the ring to that subtended by the source is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the ring radius and @xmath118 is the 1/2-light radius of the source .",
    "the @xmath119 factor accounts for the fraction of the ring that actually contains images .",
    "this gives a magnification of @xmath120 .    to obtain a more quantitative value for the magnification we have used the pixelens program @xcite to model the lens .",
    "pixelens is a parametric modeling program that reconstructs a pixelated mass map of the lens .",
    "it uses as input the coordinates of the extracted image positions and their parities along with the lens and source redshifts .",
    "it samples the solution space using a markov chain monte carlo method and generates an ensemble of mass models that reproduce the image positions .",
    "we used the sextractor image positions obtained above and assigned the parities according to the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite they note that if one uses pixels that are too large then the mass distribution is poorly resolved and not enough steep mass models are allowed .",
    "we have chosen a pixel size such that this should not be a problem .",
    "it is well known ( see for example @xcite ) that changing the slope of the mass profile changes the overall magnification , in particular a steeper slope produces a smaller magnification but does not change the image positions . therefore the quoted magnification should be taken as a representative example rather than a definitive answer .",
    "the magnification quoted is the sum over the average values of the magnification for each image position for 100 models .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath121 where the error is the quadrature sum of the rms spreads of the individual image magnifications .",
    "pixelens can also determine the enclosed mass within a given radius .",
    "for the 100 models we obtain @xmath122 which is within @xmath94 of the mass obtained from the circle fit described above .    in order to combine the strong lensing mass with the mass estimate from the weak lensing analysis ( in  [ sec : combined ] below ) we will need to estimate the mass within @xmath99 that is due to dark matter alone ( @xmath123 ) . to do this",
    "we will need to subtract estimates of the stellar mass ( @xmath124 ) and the hot gas mass ( @xmath125 ) from the total mass @xmath100 . to determine @xmath124 we use the galaxev @xcite evolutionary stellar population synthesis code to fit galaxy spectral energy distribution models to the @xmath18 magnitudes of the bcg within the einstein radius .",
    "the bcg photometric data are taken from the galfit modeling described above , and we sum up the light of the psf - deconvolved galfit model inside the einstein radius .",
    "the galaxev models considered are simple stellar population ( ssp ) models which have an initial , instantaneous burst of star formation ; such models provide good fits to early - type galaxies , such as those in clusters .",
    "in particular we find a good fit to the bcg , using a ssp model with solar metallicity , a @xcite stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , and an age 9.25  gyr ( this age provided the best @xmath126 over the range we considered , from 1  gyr to 9.3  gyr , the latter being the age of the universe for our cosmology at the cluster redshift @xmath51 ) .",
    "the resulting stellar mass ( more precisely the total stellar mass integrated over the imf ) is @xmath127 .    to estimate the gas mass @xmath125 we have looked at estimates of hot gas fraction @xmath128 in cluster cores from x - ray observations .",
    "typical @xmath128 measurements are of order 10% @xcite which give us an @xmath125 estimate of @xmath129 .",
    "finally we calculate the _ total _ @xmath130 ratio within @xmath99 for the @xmath2-band .",
    "this yields a value of @xmath131 .",
    "we used the program ellipto @xcite to compute adaptive moments @xcite of an object s light distribution , i.e. , moments optimized for signal - to - noise via weighting by an elliptical gaussian function self - consistently matched to the object s size .",
    "ellipto computes adaptive moments using an iterative method and runs off of an existing object catalog produced by sextractor for the given image .",
    "ellipto is also a forerunner of the adaptive moments measurement code used in the sdss photometric processing pipeline photo .",
    "we ran ellipto on our coadded bcs images and corresponding sextractor catalogs , doing so independently in each of the @xmath18 filters to obtain four separate catalogs of adaptive second moments : @xmath132 where @xmath133 denotes the measured counts of an object at position @xmath134 on the ccd image , and @xmath135 is the elliptical gaussian weighting function determined by ellipto .",
    "the images are oriented with the usual convention that north is up and east is to the left , i.e. , right ascension increases along the @xmath136 direction and declination increases along the @xmath137 direction .",
    "we then computed the ellipticity components @xmath138 and @xmath139 of each object using one of the standard definitions @xmath140      for each filter , we then identified a set of bright but unsaturated stars to use for psf fitting .",
    "we chose the stars from the stellar locus on a plot of the size measure @xmath141 from ellipto vs.  the magnitude mag_auto from sextractor , using simple cuts on size and magnitude to define the set of psf stars .",
    "we then derived fits of the ellipticities @xmath142 and the size @xmath141 of the stars vs.  ccd @xmath143 and @xmath144 position , using polynomial functions of cubic order in @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( i.e. , the highest order terms are @xmath145 , and @xmath146 ) . on each image , these fits were done separately in each of 8 rectangular regions , defined by splitting the image area into 2 parts along the @xmath143 direction and into 4 parts along the @xmath144 direction , corresponding to the distribution of the 8 mosaic - ii ccds over the image .",
    "this partitioning procedure was needed in order to account for discontinuities in the psf ellipticity and/or size as we cross ccd boundaries in the mosaic - ii camera .",
    "also note that the individual exposures comprising the final coadded image in each filter were only slightly dithered , so that the ccd boundaries were basically preserved in the coadd . to illustrate the psf variation in our images , we present in figure  [ fig_psf_whiskers ] `` whisker plots '' that show the spatial variation of the magnitude and orientation of the psf ellipticity across our @xmath2- and @xmath96-band images .",
    "in addition , we also show the residuals in the psf whiskers remaining after our fitting procedure , showing that the fits have done a good job of modeling the spatial variations of the psf in our data .",
    "we next used our psf model to correct our galaxy sizes and ellipticities for the effects of psf convolution . specifically , for the size measure @xmath141 we used the simple relation ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) @xmath147 to estimate the true size @xmath148 of a galaxy from its observed size @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is obtained from the psf model evaluated at the @xmath134 position of the galaxy . for the ellipticities we similarly used the related expressions @xmath151 the relations used in this simple correction procedure strictly hold only for unweighted second moments , or for adaptive moments in the special case when both the galaxy and the psf are gaussians .",
    "we have therefore also checked the results using the more sophisticated `` linear psf correction '' procedure of @xcite , which uses additional fourth order adaptive moment measurements ( also provided here by ellipto ) in the psf correction procedure .",
    "in particular , the linear psf correction method is typically applied in weak lensing analyses of sdss data .",
    "however , we found nearly indistinguishable tangential shear profiles from applying the two psf correction methods , and we therefore adopted the simpler correction method for our final results .      given the estimates of the true galaxy ellipticities from equation  ( [ eqn_etrue ] ) , we then computed the tangential ( @xmath152 ) and b - mode or cross ( @xmath153 ) ellipticity components , in a local reference frame defined for each galaxy relative to the bcg : @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the position angle ( defined west of north ) of a vector connecting the bcg to the galaxy in question . here",
    "we have dropped the subscript _ true _ for brevity .",

    "the bright magnitude cut was chosen to exclude brighter galaxies which would tend to lie in the foreground of the cluster and hence not be lensed , while the faint magnitude cuts were set to the photometric completeness limit in each filter , as defined by the turnover magnitude in the histogram of sextractor mag_auto values . for the size cut",

    "as lensing does not produce a b - mode shear signal , these results provide a check on systematic errors and should be consistent with zero in the absence of significant systematics . for all of our filters ,",
    "our b - mode shear results are indeed consistent with no detected mass , as the best - fit @xmath5 is within about 1@xmath67 of zero . on the other hand , for the tangential shear results in the @xmath96 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 filters , we do indeed obtain detections of non - zero @xmath5 at the better than @xmath166 level . in the @xmath167 filter",
    "we do not detect a non - zero @xmath5 . comparing the weak lensing results from the different filters serves as a useful check of the robustness of our lensing - based cluster mass measurement , in particular as the images in the different filters are subject to quite different psf patterns , as shown earlier in fig .",
    "[ fig_psf_whiskers ] .",
    "though the mass errors are large , the @xmath5 values from the @xmath96- , @xmath2- , and @xmath3-band weak lensing nfw fits are nonetheless consistent with each other and with the masses derived earlier from the velocity dispersion and maxbcg richness analyses .",
    "moreover , independent of the nfw fits , we have also derived probabilities ( of exceeding the observed @xmath126 ) that our _ binned _ shear profiles are consistent with the null hypothesis of zero shear . as shown in table  [ table_weak_lensing ] , we see that the b - mode profiles are in all cases consistent with zero , as expected , but that the tangential profiles for the @xmath96 and @xmath2 filters are not consistent with the null hypothesis at about the @xmath55 level ( probabilities @xmath168 ) , thus providing model - independent evidence for a weak lensing detection of the cluster mass .      here",
    "we will combine the weak lensing shear profile information from the different filters @xmath18 in order to improve the constraints on the nfw parameters , in particular on @xmath5 .",
    "the main complication here is that although the ellipticity measurement errors are independent among the different filters , the most important error for the shear measurement is the intrinsic galaxy shape noise , which is correlated among filters because a subset of the galaxies is common to two or more filters , and for these galaxies we expect their shapes to be fairly similar in the different filters .",
    "in particular we find that the covariance of the true galaxy ellipticities between filters is large , for example , the covariance of @xmath138 between the @xmath2 and @xmath96 filters , @xmath169 , is about 0.9 times the variance of @xmath138 in the @xmath2 and @xmath96 filters individually .",
    "the same holds true for @xmath139 and for the other filters as well .",
    "we will not attempt to use a full covariance matrix approach to deal with the galaxy shape correlations when we combine the data from two or more filters .",
    "instead , we take a simpler approach of scaling the measured standard deviation of the shear ( the @xmath163 used to calculate @xmath126 in equation  [ eqn_chi2 ] ) by @xmath170 , where @xmath161 is the total number of galaxies in a given multi - filter sample , and @xmath171 is the number of unique galaxies in the same sample .",
    "this is equivalent to rescaling @xmath126 in the nfw fit to correspond to @xmath171 degrees of freedom instead of @xmath161 .",
    "we have verified using least - squares fits to monte carlo simulations of nfw shear profiles that this simple approach gives the correct fit uncertainties on @xmath5 and @xmath7 when the mock galaxy data contain duplicate galaxies , with identical @xmath138 and @xmath139 values , simulating the case of _ completely _ correlated intrinsic galaxy shapes among filters .",
    "note that our approach is conservative and will slightly overestimate the errors , because the galaxy shapes in the real data are about 90% correlated , not fully correlated , among filters .    before fitting the combined shear data from multiple filters ,",
    "we make one additional multiplicative rescaling of the shear values , so that all filters will have the same effective value of @xmath165 , corresponding to a fiducial effective source redshift @xmath172 .",
    "this correction is small , with the largest being a factor of 1.18 for the @xmath3-band data .",
    "the results of the nfw fits for the multi - filter samples are given in table  [ table_weak_lensing ] , where we have tried the filter combinations @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 .",
    "we see that these multi - filter samples all provide better fractional errors on @xmath5 compared to those from the single - filter data . also , as expected , the b - mode results in all cases are consistent with no detected @xmath5 and zero shear . for our final weak lensing results ,",
    "we adopt the nfw parameters from the @xmath174 sample , as it provides the best fractional error ( @xmath176 ) on @xmath5 ; we obtain @xmath177 , and @xmath178 .",
    "figure  [ nfw_fit_irz_sl ] shows the shear profile data and best fit results for the @xmath174 sample .",
    "this final weak lensing value for @xmath5 agrees well with the earlier values of @xmath5 derived from the cluster galaxy velocity dispersion ( assuming no velocity bias ) and from the cluster richness @xmath4 .",
    "in this section we combine the strong lensing and weak lensing information together in order to further improve our constraints on the nfw profile parameters , in particular on the concentration parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the addition of the strong lensing information provides constraints on the mass within the einstein radius , close to the cluster center , thereby allowing us to better measure the central concentration of the nfw profile and improve the uncertainties on the concentration @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite incorporated the strong lensing information in the form of a constraint on the einstein radius due to just the dark matter distribution of the cluster , and they specifically excluded the contribution of ( stellar ) baryons to the einstein radius . their intent , as well as ours in this paper (   [ sec : all_combined ] ) , is to compare the observed cluster nfw concentration to that predicted from dark - matter-_only _ simulations .",
    "thus the contribution of baryonic matter should be removed , most importantly in the central region within the einstein radius , where baryonic effects are the largest due in particular to the presence of the bcg . in practice with the present data we can do this separation of the baryonic contribution only for the strong lensing constraint , and strictly speaking the weak lensing profile results from the total mass distribution rather than from dark matter alone .    here",
    "we combine the strong and weak lensing data using an analogous but somewhat simpler method compared to that of @xcite , specifically by adding a second term to @xmath126 ( equation  [ eqn_chi2 ] ) that describes the constraint on the dark matter ( only ) mass within the observed einstein radius : @xmath160 ^ 2 }                               { \\sigma_\\gamma^2 }         + \\frac{[m_{dm } ( < \\theta_e ) - m_{nfw } ( < \\theta_e ; m_{200},c_{200})]^2 }                { \\sigma_{m_{dm } ( < \\theta_e)}^2 } \\label{eqn_chi2_wl_sl}\\ ] ] where @xmath179 is the observed einstein radius due to the _ total _ cluster mass distribution , @xmath180 is the dark matter ( only ) mass within @xmath181 , and @xmath182 is the mass within @xmath181 of an nfw profile with mass @xmath5 , concentration @xmath7 , redshift @xmath51 , and source redshift @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath182 is derived based on equation  ( 13 ) of @xcite . as obtained earlier in  [ sec : lens_modeling ] , we estimate @xmath180 by subtracting estimates of the stellar mass and hot gas mass from the total mass within @xmath181 , obtaining @xmath183 when subtracting off both stellar and gas mass , or @xmath184 when subtracting off only stellar mass .",
    "the former is our best estimate of @xmath180 , while the latter serves as an upper limit on @xmath180 and hence on the best - fit concentration @xmath7 .",
    "we also conservatively estimate the error on @xmath180 to be one of the stellar mass / gas mass components added in quadrature to the uncertainty on the total @xmath100 from  [ sec : lens_modeling ] .",
    "we apply the combined strong plus weak lensing analysis to our best weak lensing sample , the multi - filter @xmath174 data set .",
    "the fit results are given in table  [ table_weak_lensing ] and shown in figure  [ nfw_fit_irz_sl ] .",
    "we find @xmath185 solar masses , nearly identical to the final weak lensing result .",
    "we also get a concentration @xmath186 , again consistent with the final weak lensing fit , but with a 30% improvement in the error on @xmath7 , demonstrating the usefulness of adding the strong lensing information to constrain the nfw concentration . using the upper limit @xmath180 value ( with only stellar mass subtracted ) gives nearly the same @xmath187 , while the resulting nfw concentration is higher , as expected , with @xmath188 , but still consistent with the fit using our best estimate of @xmath180 .      in the above sections we have obtained quite consistent constraints on the cluster mass @xmath5 using three independent techniques : ( 1 ) @xmath189 from combined weak + strong lensing (  [ sec : combined ] ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath190 from the cluster galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath191 (  [ sec : veldisp ] ; assuming no velocity bias , @xmath95 ) ; and ( 3 ) @xmath192 from the maxbcg - defined cluster richness @xmath4 (  [ sec : cluster_properties ] ) .",
    "we note that these methods are subject to different assumptions and systematic errors .",
    "for example , the velocity dispersion based mass estimate assumes the cluster is virialized , an assumption supported by the gaussian - shaped velocity distribution of the cluster members shown in fig .",
    "[ vel_disp ] . also , the richness based mass estimate relies on the @xmath4-@xmath5 calibration @xcite obtained for sdss maxbcg clusters at lower redshifts @xmath193 and assumes that this calibration remains valid for our cluster at @xmath51 .",
    "it is encouraging that we are obtaining a cluster mass measurement that appears to be robust to these disparate assumptions and that shows good agreement among multiple independent methods .",
    "we will therefore combine the results from the different techniques in order to obtain final constraints on @xmath5 and concentration @xmath7 that are significantly improved over what any one technique permits .",
    "specifically , we can add the @xmath5 constraints from the velocity dispersion and richness measurements as additional terms to the weak + strong lensing @xmath126 ( equation  [ eqn_chi2_wl_sl ] ) : @xmath194 ^ 2 }                               { \\sigma_\\gamma^2 }           + \\frac{[m_{dm } ( < \\theta_e ) - m_{nfw } ( < \\theta_e ; m_{200},c_{200})]^2 }                      { \\sigma_{m_{dm } ( < \\theta_e)}^2 } \\nonumber \\\\         & + & \\frac{[m_{200}(\\sigma_c)-m_{200}]^2}{\\sigma_{m_{200}(\\sigma_c)}^2 }             + \\frac{[m_{200}(n_{200})-m_{200}]^2}{\\sigma_{m_{200}(n_{200})}^2 } \\label{eqn_chi2_all}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] minimizing this overall @xmath126 results in the final best - fitting nfw parameters @xmath195 and @xmath8 .",

    "dark matter is dominant over the bulk of the cluster , while baryons can have a significant effect in the cluster core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
