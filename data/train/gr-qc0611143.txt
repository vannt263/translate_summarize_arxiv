    "three - dimensional static circularly symmetric solution of three - dimensional einstein s equations ( the btz black hole @xcite ) attracted much interest last years , and is believed to be a good relatively simple laboratory for analyzing general aspects of black hole physics .",
    "the btz solution is the most general black hole solution in three dimensions , which is guaranteed by the three - dimensional version of birkhoff s theorem @xcite .",
    "it has very interesting classical and quantum properties ( for review see , i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "global structure of the btz solution was analyzed in @xcite . in these articles the black hole space - time was considered as the quotient space of the anti - de sitter space by the action of the discrete transformation group .",
    "this approach deserves a deeper analysis because the transformation group has fixed points , and therefore the quotient space is not a manifold .",
    "the situation is unclear especially in the interior region of the black hole . to clarify the global structure of the interior region",
    ", we consider the btz solution for zero cosmological constant . in this simple case ,",
    "all coordinate transformations can be written explicitly , and behavior of geodesics is analyzed .",
    "we prove that the maximally extended ( along geodesics ) btz solution for zero cosmological constant coincides with flat minkowskian space - time without any singularity and horizons for infinite range of the angle coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "the btz solution in the original coordinates covers only one half of the minkowskian space - time , and the two planes corresponding to @xmath1 are just coordinate singularities .",
    "two copies of the btz solution cover the whole minkowskian space - time and are smoothly glued at @xmath1 .    if we make the angle identification @xmath2 than four cones with the same vertex appear in the interior region of the btz black hole located at the inner horizon @xmath3 .",
    "next we analyze the euclidean version of the btz solution . in this case",
    "the solution has physical interpretation in solid state physics . in the geometric theory of defects developed in @xcite ( for review see @xcite ) it depends on the poisson ratio and describes combined wedge and screw dislocations .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional manifold @xmath4 with local coordinates @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "suppose it is endowed with a lorentzian signature metric @xmath7 , @xmath8 , which satisfies einstein s equations @xmath9 with a cosmological constant @xmath10 . in three dimensions",
    "the full curvature tensor is defined by its ricci tensor @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the totally antisymmetric tensor , @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , any smooth solution of einstein s equations on a manifold ( by solution we mean a pair @xmath14 ) is a space - time of constant curvature .",
    "the universal covering spaces for positive , zero , and negative cosmological constant are respectively de sitter , euclidean , and anti de sitter spaces .",
    "all other smooth solutions @xmath14 are obtained from these solutions by an action of an isometry transformation group which acts freely and properly discontinuous ( see , i.e.  @xcite ) .",
    "afterwards , a solution will be isometric to some fundamental domain of de sitter , euclidean , or anti de sitter space with properly identified boundaries .",
    "these solutions are considered as known ones though explicit action of a transformation group may be quite complicated .",
    "all these solutions are smooth , have no singularities and horizons , and therefore do not describe black holes .",

    "the mass is supposed to be positive , because otherwise there is no horizon .",
    "the case @xmath29 and @xmath30 , corresponding to de sitter asymptotic ( which has a horizon ) is not considered because @xmath0 can not be interpreted as the angle coordinate in this case .",
    "the sign of @xmath17 corresponds to left and right rotations and does not contribute to the global structure of the solution .",
    "thus , range of coordinates ( [ eracod ] ) and the signs of the cosmological constant and the mass are uniquely determined by two requirements : ( i ) @xmath0 is an angle in the asymptotic region @xmath28 and ( ii ) the solution has at least one horizon .",
    "\\3 ) for zero cosmological constant @xmath31 and angular momentum @xmath32 the metric is @xmath33 for positive mass @xmath34 , it has no conical singularity at @xmath1 because now @xmath35 and @xmath0 are coordinates on the two - dimensional minkowskian space - time of signature @xmath36 but not on the euclidean plane .",
    "this is in contrast with a common belief that static point particles in three - dimensional gravity are described by conical singularities , distributed on a space - like section of @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "second , the coordinate lines have different character , and the induced metric on sections of @xmath4 corresponding to constant angle @xmath47 differs essentially from ( [ etomse ] )",

    "the cut out or added wedge of media corresponds to the wedge dislocation , and the displacement of the lower side of the cut along the @xmath214 axis describes the screw dislocation .",
    "both types of dislocations are experimentally observed defects in real crystals ( see i.e.  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , metric ( [ ejteme ] ) qualitatively describes nontrivial geometry around combined wedge and screw dislocations . for this metric",
    ", we can construct triad field and the corresponding torsion tensor which is equal to the surface density of the burgers vector .",
    "we used the word `` qualitatively '' because a solution of einstein s equations can be written in an arbitrary coordinate system and does not depend on lame coefficients which characterize the elastic properties of media .",
    "the coordinate transformation ( [ ecotrj ] ) describes only cut and paste process of defect creation . in reality , the media comes to the equilibrium state after gluing both sides of the cut , and this process is driven by the elasticity theory equations .",
    "therefore , the induced metric must depend on lame coefficients . to consolidate gravity and elasticity theories we proposed to use the elastic gauge @xcite",
    "it is given by the following construction .",
    "first , we fix the cylindrical coordinates @xmath221 in the euclidean space related to the considered problem .",
    "the flat metric and the triad field are marked with a circle over a symbol @xmath222 then the elastic gauge is chosen to be @xmath223 where a circle over the covariant derivative @xmath224 means that it is constructed for flat metric @xmath225 ; @xmath226 , and @xmath227 is the poisson ratio defined by the lame coefficients @xcite .",
    "physical meaning of this gauge condition is based on the linear approximation .",
    "suppose defects are absent , and we have only elastic deformations described by the displacement vector field @xmath228 which parameterizes diffeomorphisms of @xmath172 . for simplicity",

    "( [ eqsepu ] ) is quite obvious .",
    "introduction of flat covariant derivatives in the elastic gauge ( [ elgbtz ] ) allows us to use arbitrary coordinate systems .",
    "the triad field corresponding to metric ( [ ejteme ] ) is @xmath232 the @xmath233 part of the triad corresponds to the symmetrized linear approximation ( [ elinar ] ) , and the constant unsymmetrical @xmath234 part does not alter the form of the elastic gauge condition .",
    "we change the radial coordinate @xmath208 to rewrite the triad in the elastic gauge .",
    "then the elastic gauge condition ( [ elgbtz ] ) reduces to the euler ordinary differential equation @xmath235 this is the same equation which arises for pure wedge dislocation @xcite ( the interested reader can find more details there ) .",
    "to uniquely fix the solution of this equation , we suppose that the media fills only the cylinder of finite radius @xmath127 ( this is needed to avoid divergences ) and impose two additional gauge conditions @xmath236 the first gauge condition means the absence of external forces on the surface of the cylinder , and the second one corresponds to the absence of the angular component of the deformation tensor at the core of dislocation .",
    "afterwards , the solution of eq.([eulgae ] ) is uniquely defined @xmath237 where @xmath238 thus , the euclidean version of the btz solution for zero cosmological constant ( [ ejteme ] ) in the elastic gauge ( [ elgbtz ] ) becomes @xmath239 this is the exact solution of the euclidean einstein equations written in the elastic gauge .",
    "it describes the induced metric around combined wedge and screw dislocations and nontrivially depends on the poisson ratio characterizing the elastic properties of media .",
    "below , this solution is compared with the result obtained entirely within the elasticity theory without referring to einstein equations .",
    "the wedge and screw dislocations are relatively simple linear defects in solids , and the corresponding displacement vector field can be explicitly found as the solution to the linear elasticity field equations ( [ eqsepu ] ) .",
    "the results are well known , and we skip their derivation . the displacement vector field for the wedge dislocation in cylindrical coordinates @xmath240 is @xcite @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the base of the natural logarithm .",
    "the displacement vector field for the screw dislocation is @xcite @xmath243 where @xmath56 is the burgers vector .",
    "the displacements vectors can be added in the linear elasticity theory , and the total displacement vector for combined wedge and screw dislocations becomes @xmath244 in our notations , the coordinate transformation corresponding to this displacement vector field is @xmath245 the induced metric within the elasticity theory becomes @xmath246d\\phi^2 \\\\    & + d\\z^2 - 2cd{\\zeta}d\\phi . \\end{split}\\ ] ] the linear elasticity theory equations are valid for small relative displacements @xmath247 .",
    "therefore , the induced metric in the elasticity theory is expected to give correct answer for small deficit angle @xmath248 , small burgers vector @xmath249 , and near the surface of the cylinder @xmath250 .    to compare metrics ( [ eubtze ] ) and ( [ elmets ] ) ,",
    "it is enough to consider small deficit angles . for @xmath248 , @xmath251 expanding expression ( [ eubtze ] ) in @xmath54 , we obtain metric ( [ elmets ] ) in the linear approximation .",
    "so , the elasticity theory induced metric reproduces only the linear approximation of the exact solution of the euclidean einstein s equations within the geometric theory of defects .",
    "metric ( [ eubtze ] ) obtained within the geometric approach is simpler in its form , valid for the whole range of radius @xmath252 , all deficit angles @xmath253 , and burgers vectors @xmath56 .",
    "the components of the induced metric are proportional to the stress tensor of media .",
    "therefore , the result obtained within the geometric theory of defects can be verified experimentally .",
    "we considered the btz black hole solution for zero cosmological constant in detail .",
    "this case describes the interior region of the btz black hole and is simple enough to perform all calculation explicitly .",
    "we showed that points at @xmath1 are just coordinate singularities , and all geometric quantities are regular there , while the line @xmath26 corresponding to the inner horizon is singular : these points are not points of a manifold .",
