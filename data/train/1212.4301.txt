    "effect of spin ordering on the symmetry and lattice parameters of magnetic crystals , termed as magnetoelasticity , has recently attracted remarkable interest in multiferroic materials and complex magnets .",
    "this is because magnetoelasticity is closely related to the magnetocapacintace and other magnetoelectric phenomena @xcite .",
    "the dynamical coupling between lattice vibrations and spin - wave excitations plays also a crucial role in the electromagnon excitations of manganese oxides @xcite . for several chromium spinel oxides , the materials in the focus of the present study ,",
    "multiferroic ordering has been reported at low temperatures and strong magnetic field induced changes were also found in their dielectric response @xcite . in order to reveal the nature and origin of spin - phonon coupling governing magneto - elasticity , optical probe of lattice vibrations has been shown to be an efficient tool for a broad class of chromium spinel oxides and chalcogenides with non - magnetic a - site ions @xcite .    at high temperatures acr@xmath0o@xmath1 chromium spinel oxides",

    "a@xmath2 ions form a diamond lattice with tetrahedral oxygen environment , while magnetic cr@xmath4 ions surrounded by octahedral oxygen cages form a pyrochlore sublattice . in the local crystal field of oxygen ions ,",
    "the 3d orbitals of a cr@xmath4 ion are split into a low - lying @xmath5 triplet and a higher - energy @xmath6 doublet , while the orbitals of an a@xmath2 ion are split into a lower @xmath7 doublet and a higher @xmath8 triplet as illustrated in fig .",

    "the presence of magnetic moment and orbital degeneracy on the a - site ions can change the magnetic and structural properties in chromium spinel oxides in two ways as compared to those members of the acr@xmath0o@xmath1 family where cr@xmath4 is the only magnetic ion .",
    "first , the antiferromagnetic j@xmath9 exchange interaction between neighboring cr@xmath4 ions leads to a highly frustrated ground state on the pyrochlore sublattice .",
    "this frustration can only be released by the so - called spin - jahn - teller effect for compounds with nonmagnetic a - site ions , where lattice distortions induce differences between the exchange coefficients originally uniform for each cr@xmath4-cr@xmath4 pairs .",
    "this removes the spin degeneracy of the ground state and consequently long - range magnetic order can develop as was observed at low temperatures in case of zncr@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and cdcr@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if a - site ions are magnetic , the coupling of s=3/2 cr@xmath4 spins to the a - site spins on the bipartite diamond lattice removes the magnetic frustration and the magnetic ordering occurs at much higher temperatures comparable to the energy scale of the exchange interactions .",
    "second , if a - site ions have orbital degeneracy in the cubic spinel structure , it is lifted by a cooperative jahn - teller distortion resulting to a tetragonal structure with space group i4@xmath10/amd already in the high - temperature paramagnetic phase @xcite and the onset of magnetic order may result in further reduction of the lattice symmetry through a spin - lattice coupling . on the other hand , chromium oxide spinels with magnetic a sites but without orbital degeneracy",
    "are reported to nearly maintain the cubic structure even in their low - temperature magnetic state @xcite . besides spinel chromites , the impact of orbital degeneracy on the magnetic and structural properties is clearly manifested in vanadium oxide spinels , where both diamond and pyrochlore sublattices can host orbital degeneracy .",
    "the most peculiar example is fev@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , which exhibits successive structural transitions due to the interplay between the jahn - teller effect on the two sublattices and the influence of the spin order .    in the present paper",

    "splitting of the third and fourth phonon modes in nicr@xmath0o@xmath1 is @xmath574% and @xmath571% , while the lowest- and highest - energy phonons in fecr@xmath0o@xmath1 are split by @xmath7420% and @xmath571% , respectively .",
    "most of the modes whose degeneracy is partly lifted by the cooperative jahn - teller distortion or those activated upon the splitting of silent @xmath38 lattice vibrations , as is the case in nicr@xmath0o@xmath1 , are further split upon the ferrimagnetic ordering .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetically induced splitting is in the range of @xmath5710% for low - energy and @xmath571% for high - energy phonon modes , the large splitting of low - energy modes implies strong spin - lattice coupling for these lattice vibrations resulting in the strong magnetoelastic effects .",
    "recently , the static orthorhombic distortion of the crystalline lattice upon the magnetic phase transition has also been observed by means of high - resolution x - ray diffraction in nicr@xmath0o@xmath1 and cucr@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .    in conclusions",
    ", we found that in acr@xmath0o@xmath1 spinel compounds  where the frustration of the pyrochlore sublattice is lifted by long - range magnetic ordering due to the exchange interaction between the spins of the a@xmath2 and cr@xmath4 ions  the criterion of strong magnetoelasticity is the orbital degeneracy of the a - site ion in the high - symmetry cubic phase .",
    "this observation is valid irrespective to the details of the magnetic order , i.e. we found strong magnetoelasticity for the compounds fecr@xmath0o@xmath1 , nicr@xmath0o@xmath1 and cucr@xmath0o@xmath1 independently whether they have conical or canted spin order in their ground state . a theoretical model reproducing the effect of orbital occupancy on the magnetoelasticity of these compounds will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "moreover , based on the analysis of the intraatomic _",
    "3d_-_3d _ transition of the a - site ions , we could determine the following fundamental energies : crystal - field splitting in the cubic and tetragonal phases , the racah parameters representing the strength of the intraatomic coulomb repulsion and the spin - orbit interaction in some cases .",
