    "in this article we construct a piecewise euclidean , non - positively curved @xmath0-complex for the @xmath1-generator artin groups of large type .",
    "although standard presentations for the artin groups typically use words which alternate between pairs of the generators , there are other presentations with ` nicer ' properties .",
    "we shall be employing one of these .    if we let @xmath2 denote the word of the form @xmath3 with exactly @xmath4 letters , then the standard presentation of an artin group with three generators is given as @xmath5    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are positive integers greater than @xmath9 . after introducing an alternative presentation",
    ", we will show that the new presentation satisfies the small cancellation conditions @xmath10 . as a consequence",
    ", a metric of non - positive curvature can be defined on the standard @xmath0-complex of this presentation and by @xcite the group it defines is biautomatic . in the final section , we present a generalization of this result .",
    "the non - positively curved @xmath0-complex alluded to above is constructed by altering the standard presentations for artin groups .",
    "consider the following families of group presentations .",
    "@xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14    note that @xmath15 is the standard presentation for artin groups with two generators .",
    "we will now show that the other presentations define the same group .",
    "[ equivalent ]    for all @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "start with @xmath15 .",
    "if we add a new generator @xmath18 to @xmath15 with definition @xmath19 , and then use this relation to eliminate @xmath20 we will end up with the presentation @xmath21 . the precise form of the presentation will depend on whether @xmath6 is even or odd . since this process can also be reversed , @xmath22 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath23 is even more straight - forward .",
    "the relations of @xmath23 are derived by partitioning the unique relation of @xmath21 , while the relation in @xmath21 is formed by arranging the relations of @xmath23 to eliminate the generators @xmath20 , @xmath24 ,  , @xmath25 .",
    "this correspondence is illustrated in figure  [ relations ] .      and",
    "@xmath26 [ relations],title=\"fig : \" ]    [ presentation ]    the artin group @xmath27 can be presented as follows : @xmath28    if the tietze transformations described in the proof of the previous lemma are applied to each of the sets of relations in this presentation , the result will be the standard presentation ( equation  [ stnd - pres ] ) . notice that @xmath29 and @xmath30 play the role of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the first set of equations , @xmath30 and @xmath33 play the role of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the second set , and @xmath33 and @xmath29 play the role of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the third set .",
    "let @xmath38 be the standard @xmath0-complex associated with the presentation @xmath39 given in lemma  [ presentation ] .",
    "the complex @xmath38 has a unique @xmath40-cell , @xmath41 @xmath9-cells ( one for each of the generators ) , and @xmath41 triangular @xmath0-cells ( one for each of the relations ) .",
    "of particular interest is the link the unique @xmath40-cell . recall that the link of a @xmath40-cell in a @xmath0-complex is the graph obtained by intersecting a small sphere centered at the @xmath40-cell with the surrounding complex . in this case , each @xmath9-cell will contribute two vertices to the link , and each corner of a @xmath0-cell will contribute an edge .",
    "the link of @xmath38 will be refered to as @xmath42 .",
    "the link @xmath43 is shown in figure  [ example ] , with the exception that the two vertices on the extreme right need to be identified with the two vertices on the extreme left .",
    "we have adopted the convention that letters without bars denote the vertex contributed by the head of the oriented @xmath9-cell and letters with bars denote the vertex contributed by the tail .     [ example ] ]    notice that the link is essentially composed of three links of @xmath0-generator artin groups joined together along pairs of vertices . in the example",
    "shown , we see the link of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath26 laid side by side . each of these links is in turn made up of packets of paths of length @xmath1 which are twisted together .",
    "the subgraphs corresponding to the @xmath0-generator artin groups will be called the local pieces of the link .",
    "notice also that these local pieces overlap only at vertices which arise from the standard generators @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and",
    "@xmath33 . another key property of the link is that the vertices separate themselves into @xmath46 distinct levels , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 at the bottom ( level @xmath9 ) , and @xmath18 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 at the top ( level @xmath46 ) .",
    "the edges connecting levels @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be called middle edges .    in figure",
    "[ example ] there are two short loops of length @xmath46 . namely the paths connecting @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we will now show that if there are no commutation relations , then no short embedded loops can exist .",
    "[ short loops ]    if @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are all at least @xmath1 then every embedded loop in @xmath42 contains at least @xmath54 edges .    ( sketch ) since every edge in the link joins a pair of vertices on adjacient levels , we see that the link is bipartite , and thus every embedded loop will have an even length .",
    "furthermore , it should be clear from the example that embedded loops of length @xmath0 can not occur , so that it only remains to examine possible loops of length @xmath46 .",
    "if there was a loop of length @xmath46 which contained a top vertex or a bottom vertex , then the entire loop would be contained in the radius two neighbourhood of this vertex .",
    "an examination however shows this neighborhood is a tree . as an example , the radius two neighbourhood of @xmath50 in @xmath55 is shown in figure  [ neighborhood ] . on the otherhand , if there was such a loop which did not pass through a top or bottom vertex then it would be completely composed of middle edges .",
    "the subcomplex of these edges however consists of @xmath56 disjoint edges and three chains of length @xmath1 .",
    "this completes the proof .    in the language of small cancellation theory",
    ", this lemma shows that the presentation @xmath39 satisfies the condition @xmath57 .",
    "neighborhood of @xmath50 in the link @xmath55 [ neighborhood],title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the complex @xmath38 can be given a piecewise euclidean metric by assigning length of @xmath9 to each @xmath9-cell and making each @xmath0-cell an equilateral triangle .",
    "this metric also induces a metric on the link of the @xmath40-cell by assigning the angle at a corner of a @xmath0-cell as the length of the corresponding edge in the link . in this instance , the triangles are all equilateral . thus all of the edges in the link are assigned a length of @xmath58 .    if @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are all at least @xmath1 , then the metric on @xmath38 is non - positive curved and the group @xmath27 is biautomatic . in particular , all @xmath1-generator artin groups of large type are biautomatic .    by lemma  [ short loops ] , every embedded loop in the link of the @xmath40-cell contains at least six edges , and thus it measures at least @xmath59 . by @xcite",
    "this proves that the metric on @xmath38 is non - positively curved .",
    "that the group is biautomatic follows from a result of gersten and short ( @xcite ) . in their terminology",
    "@xmath38 is an @xmath60 complex .",
    "in order to extend this result artin groups with more than three generators , additional terminology needs to be introduced .",
    "an arbitrary artin group can be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath61 be a undirected graph with no loops or multiple edges and with a positive integer greater than @xmath9 assigned to each edge .",
    "the standard presentation for the artin group associated to @xmath61 is defined as follows : it has one generator for each of the vertices of @xmath61 and for each edge there is a relation . in particular ,",
    "if there is an edge connected a vertex @xmath29 to a vertex @xmath30 which is labeled by @xmath6 then we add the relation @xmath62 .",
    "we will call this presentation @xmath63 .    in order to convert this presentation into a presentation like that used in lemma  [ presentation ] , we need to include additional information .",
    "there is an ambiguity which stems from the fact that the presentation @xmath15 is symmetric with respect to the generators @xmath64 and @xmath20 , but the equivalent presentation @xmath23 is not . in particular , notice that in @xmath23 , @xmath65 occurs as a subword of a relation , but that @xmath66 does not .",
    "thus to precisely define a presentation of the type we have been considering , we need to require that the defining graph @xmath61 is a directed graph . the direction will indicate which subword of length @xmath0 to be preserved in the rewriting process .",
    "the presentation which results will be called @xmath67 , the standard @xmath0-complex for this presentation will be denoted @xmath68 , and the link of its unique @xmath40-cell will be denoted @xmath69 .    in figure  [ mnp ]",
    "we have displayed the defining graph @xmath61 which leads to the presentation given in lemma  [ presentation ] .",
    "although it was not highlighted at the time , the orientations of the edges of @xmath61 were in fact crucial to the argument in the proof of lemma  [ short loops ] .",
    "as we will see in lemma  [ graphs ] , if one of the orientations had been reversed then embedded loops of length @xmath46 would indeed have been present in the link .      as in the @xmath1-generator case",
    "the link @xmath69 is a bipartite graph with @xmath46 distinct levels of vertices , and since it is bipartite , all of its embedded loops will have an even length . the link itself is comprised of various local pieces which look like the link of @xmath23 for some @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , any two of these local pieces are joined to each other only at a pair of vertices which correspond to a generator of @xmath63 that arises from a vertex of @xmath61 .",
    "for example , in figure  [ example ] the local pieces which look like the links of @xmath45 and @xmath26 are joined together at the vertices @xmath33 and @xmath70 , and these vertices correspond the generator @xmath33 in @xmath63 that corresponds to the vertex labeled @xmath33 in figure  [ mnp ] .",
    "the vertices in @xmath69 which correspond in this way to the vertices of @xmath61 will be called special vertices and the edges whose endpoints are both special will be called special edges .",
    "there is another connection between @xmath61 and @xmath69 which will be useful in the proof given below .",
    "if the vertices of the link are organized so that the vertices fall into four distinct levels , the pairs of vertices are aligned to that the one with the bar is directly below the other , and the local pieces of the link lie in a vertical @xmath0-dimensional surface , then the graph @xmath61 can be thought of as the `` top - view '' of the link . in this view",
    "the pairs of special vertices where the local pieces overlap are seen as the vertices of @xmath61 , the local pieces which are in one - to - one correspondence with the edges of @xmath61 are seen as being projected onto the appropriate edges , and the special edges in the link which allow one to get from a special vertex in level @xmath0 to a special vertex in level @xmath1 in a single step , are seen as the ones which give the orientation to the edge corresponding to its local piece .",
    "the link @xmath69 contains an embedded loop of length @xmath46 if and only if the defining graph @xmath61 contains an oriented subgraph isomorphic to one of the graphs in figure  [ bad graphs ] .",
    "moreover , these loops of length @xmath46 are the only possible embedded loops of length less than @xmath54",
    ".    we will begin by showing that all short loops must involve at least @xmath1 local pieces .",
    "clearly the local pieces themselves have no embedded loops of length less than @xmath54 , so consider a subgraph of the link consisting of only @xmath0 ( connected ) local pieces and let @xmath29 and @xmath71 be the pair of vertices connecting them . since the shortest path connecting @xmath29 to @xmath71 has length @xmath1 and the shortest embedded path connecting either vertex to itself has length @xmath54 , all of the loops in this subgraph will have length at least @xmath54 .",
    "next , we will establish the forward direction .",
    "assume that @xmath69 contains a short embedded loop of length @xmath46 .",
    "if this loop does not contain a top or a bottom vertex , then it is comprised entirely of middle edges .",
    "since the special vertices are the only vertices in levels @xmath0 or @xmath1 which are connected to more than one middle edge , all four vertices in the loop must be special and as a result all four of the edges are special as well .",
    "the vertices which are adjacient in the loop must correspond to distinct vertices in @xmath61 since they connected by a special edge , and the vertices which are not adjacient in the loop must also correspond to distinct vertices in @xmath61 since the loop is embedded .",
    "this shows that the subgraph of @xmath61 determined by these four special vertices contains the graph on the righthand of figure  [ bad graphs ] as a subgraph .",
    "if this short loop contained more than one top or bottom vertex then it would be contained in the union of two local pieces since all of the edges connected to a top or bottom vertex belong to the same local piece .",
    "we have already shown that the union of two local pieces do not contain short loops , so there are no short loops of this type .",
    "finally , suppose this short loop contained exactly one top vertex .",
    "since the edges connected to it belong to the same local piece and since we know that at least three local pieces are involved , the other two edges must lie in distinct local pieces .",
    "thus all three of the other vertices are special , and the two edges not connected to the top vertex are special .",
    "since three distinct local pieces are involved it is clear that the three special vertices correspond to distinct vertices in @xmath61 . at this point",
    "we know that the subgraph of @xmath61 determined by these these three local pieces is a triangle , and we know the orientations of two of the sides .",
    "the orientation of the third side ( corresponding to the local piece containing the top vertex ) is unknown , but with either orientation , the resulting graph is isomorphic to the graph on the lefthandside of figure  [ bad graphs ] .",
    "since the case of exactly one bottom vertex is similar , the proof in the forward direction is complete .",
    "the proof in the other direction is essentially immediate . if either of these graphs appears as a subgraph of @xmath61 , then it is easy to exhibit a path of length @xmath46 in the link .",
    "the embedded loops of length @xmath46 which result from the graph on the left will be called loops of type @xmath72 while those which result from the one on the right will be called loops of type @xmath73 .",
    "since by hypothesis loops of type @xmath72 can not occur , we can conclude that all loops of length @xmath46 contain @xmath46 middle edges ( since this is true for loops of type @xmath73 ) .",
    "next , we claim that all loops of length @xmath54 must contain at least @xmath0 middle edges .",
    "the structure of the link guarantees that a loop will contain an even number of middle edges .",
    "if it did not contain any middle edges , then it would be contained in either the top or the bottom . since top and bottom vertices are only connected to edges in the same local piece of the link , the loop itself",
    "would be contained in three local pieces .",
    "this would implies that a triangle exists in @xmath61 , contradiction .    to complete the proof we assign a metric to @xmath68 as follows .",
    "the @xmath9-cells corresponding to the top and bottom vertices are assigned a length of @xmath74 and all others are assigned a length of @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath0-cells are euclidean triangles with angles of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the conditions shown in the previous paragraph , demonstrate that all embedded loops in the link have a length of at least @xmath59 , and by @xcite the metric on @xmath68 is non - positively curved . gersten and short ( @xcite ) again allow us to conclude that the group @xmath63 is biautomatic . in their terminology @xmath77 is a complex of type @xmath78 .",
    "this particular result was in some sense already known since pride showed that the standard presentation of these ` triangle - free ' artin groups satisfies the @xmath79 conditions ( @xcite ) , and gersten - short showed that @xmath79 groups are biautomatic ( @xcite ) .",
    "the interest here lies in the alternate method of proof .",
    "the following result is new .",
    "let @xmath61 be a graph with every edge labeled by a positive integer greater than @xmath0 .",
    "if there is a way of orienting the edges in the graph so that neither of the graphs in figure  [ bad graphs ] appear as subgraphs , then @xmath68 has a metric of non - positive curvature and the artin group @xmath63 is biautomatic .",
    "since by lemma  [ graphs ] there are no embedded loops of length less than @xmath54 in the link @xmath69 , the metric which assigns a length of @xmath9 to each @xmath9-cell and gives each @xmath0-cell the metric of a euclidean equilateral triangle will be non - positively - curved ( @xcite ) . and since @xmath68 is an @xmath60 complex , by @xcite the corresponding group is biautomatic .",
    "let @xmath61 be a graph in which all of the vertices have even degree and assign large integers ( each at least @xmath1 ) to each of its edges .",
    "if @xmath61 can be embedded in the plane so that all of its short embedded loops ( length @xmath1 or @xmath46 ) actually bound components of the complement of @xmath61 , then the corresponding artin group @xmath63 will be biautomatic .",
    "the proof is an easy application of theorem  [ generalization ] . in particular",
    ", we can use the planarity of the graph to orient the edges . assign an oriention to each of the regions of the complement so that regions separated by an edge are given opposite orientations .",
    "the condition on the degrees of the vertices guarantees that this is possible .",
    "now use these orientations to induce the orientations of the edges . the condition on the embedded loops",
    "now guarrantees that neither of the forbidden subgraphs can occur , and by theorem  [ generalization ] , the group @xmath63 is biautomatic .",
    "theorem  [ generalization ] can be extended to include commutation relations under the following restrictions . since the link of a commutation relation includes special edges in _ both _ directions , edges labeled by a @xmath0 in @xmath61",
    "must be considered as oriented in both directions . in particular ,",
    "when searching for a subgraph of type @xmath72 or @xmath73 , the edges labeled @xmath0 must be considered as ` wildcards ' which can adopt either orientation as needed .",
    "if there is an orientation of the other edges of @xmath61 so that these subgraphs do not appear , then the corresponding complex @xmath68 has a metric of non - positive curvature and the group @xmath63 is biautomatic .    using various techniques",
    ", researchers have shown that other classes of artin groups are biautomatic .",
    "this is known , for example , for the artin groups of finite type ( r.  charney @xcite ) and for the artin groups of extra - large type ( d.  peifer @xcite ) . despite this progress",
