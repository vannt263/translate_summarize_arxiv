    "<S> ( [ eq - tunnel_probability ] ) , we calculate the probabilities @xmath35 of tunneling into the spin - polarized final state [ red lines in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the energy dependent term @xmath37 dominates the outcome of the tunneling rates ( eq .  [ eq - tunnel_rate ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> we expect that for a small negative @xmath11 tunneling into the molecular state is predominant . ] . here , @xmath36 is determined by the ratio of the spin overlaps between the first two spins of the initial states and the fm two - particle states @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the theoretically predicted @xmath36 of the afm state in the tilted trap [ red solid line in fig  [ fig - tunneling](a ) ] with the experimental data ( blue points ) shows good agreement , while the fm ( red dashed line ) and i m ( red dotted line ) states are clearly excluded . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that before tunneling both below and above the cir the system is in the afm state . </S>",
    "<S> the gray points at @xmath42 indicate a narrow resonance effect that couples the afm state to the i m state of the spin chain . </S>",
    "<S> since this resonance is accompanied by strongly enhanced three - body losses  @xcite , we suspect it to be caused by a coupling of the afm and the i m states via a molecular state with center - of - mass excitation . the coupling to such molecular states is strongly enhanced by the anharmonicity of our tilted trap  @xcite .    for the afm state of the @xmath6 system , a similar calculation predicts @xmath43 on resonance and a saturation value of @xmath44 deep in the super - tonks regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig  [ fig - tunneling](b ) , the general trend of our measurements agrees with this prediction for the afm state , but in the super - tonks regime , there is a significant deviation . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this deviation is that the calculation assumes an adiabatic lowering of the potential barrier . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling energies of all tunneling channels are always well below the barrier maximum . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this condition is not fulfilled for the @xmath6 system in the super - tonks regime , where an especially low potential barrier was used for the tunneling measurement . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if we model a nonadiabatic lowering of the potential barrier , the contribution from tunneling into the i m state reduces @xmath36 to values that are compatible with the experimental results  @xcite . in order to study the spin configuration of the balanced @xmath17 system , </S>",
    "<S> we adapt the previous procedure and let two atoms tunnel out of the trap . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 is defined as the probability to end up in state @xmath40 , where both spin - down atoms tunneled out of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> again , the predicted @xmath46 on resonance and the limiting value of @xmath47 in the super - tonks regime are in good agreement with the experiment as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - tunneling](c ) .    to independently confirm the results of our measurement of the spin distribution </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a second set of measurements that directly probes the spatial wave function of the system . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - sketch](a ) , the relative spatial wave function between identical spins always exhibits a smooth zero crossing , while between distinguishable spins with strong interactions it can exhibit a cusp . the cusps lead to occupancies of high - energy trap levels , while the zero crossings require only the occupation of the lowest trap levels . in general , the more symmetric the spatial wave function of a state is , the more cusps it will contain . therefore , the occupation - number distribution on single - particle trap levels directly reveals the spin configuration of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> to probe this distribution , we prepare an interacting ( 2,1 ) or ( 3,1 ) system and remove all atoms of the spin - up component from the trap with a short pulse of light . </S>",
    "<S> the light is @xmath48 polarized and resonant to the d2 transition of the spin - up atoms @xmath49 to @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that within our experimental fidelity all spin - up atoms are removed from the trap by the light pulse , while only @xmath51 of the population of spin - down atoms is lost . </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath52 the duration of the light pulse is significantly shorter than the inverse longitudinal trap frequency of approximately @xmath53 , which sets the timescale of redistribution along the spin chain . </S>",
    "<S> this process therefore projects the spin - down component of the wave function of the interacting ( @xmath54)-particle system on single - particle trap levels . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we measure the mean occupancies on the single - particle trap levels  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - occupancies ] we compare the mean occupancies of the spin - down atom for the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 systems in the super - tonks regime with the theoretical prediction that we obtained by numerically diagonalizing the many - body hamiltonian for these systems . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison shows that both systems are in the afm spin state and thereby confirms that our systems follow this state throughout the fermionization regime .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have prepared antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin chains of up to four atoms in a one - dimensional trap and independently probed the spin distributions and spatial wave functions of the systems . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes a direct observation of quantum magnetism beyond two - particle correlations in a system of ultracold fermionic atoms . by using the methods developed in ref .  </S>",
