    "given the orthonormality of both bases @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the schmidt decomposition of states of the form ( [ eq : basic state ] ) is just written in the same basis , but with the non negative coefficients @xmath23 .",
    "the schmidt coefficients @xmath24 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix @xmath25 .",
    "it follows that the only factorized states are those with @xmath26 for every @xmath27 except one .",
    "the entanglement of a pure state @xmath28 is estimated by the von neumann entropy @xmath29 . in the following ,",
    "we shorten @xmath30 .    for estimating the entanglement of pure states , in this work we use a generalization of the concurrence that we construct in the following way .",
    "first , let us consider the easiest case @xmath31 with the two elements of the basis @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in the full 4-dimensional space the double spin - flip operation is performed by @xmath34 , and the concurrence is given by the well - known formula @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the complex conjugate of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the usual pauli matrices acting on single qubits . in our special @xmath31 case for states in a pair basis ,",
    "the concurrence becomes @xmath40 , where the swap is represented by the single pauli matrix @xmath41 acting on the pair basis .",
    "any extension to the @xmath42-dimensional case has to take into account the fact that for product states , the concurrence has to be zero in every possible two - dimensional subspace .",
    "even if the literature proposes different generalizations of the concurrence @xcite , we opt to take the sum over every two - dimensional concurrence @xmath43 which manifestly vanishes only in the factorized case and likewise it fulfills the additivity property whenever the dimension @xmath42 is built up by the direct product of two - dimensional states . in our picture , each term of eq.([eq : d1 ] ) considers the state @xmath44 as the spin - flipped of @xmath45 . a remarkable fact that further justifies",
    "the choice of the quantity @xmath46 is that it turns out to be twice the negativity @xmath47 , where @xmath48 stands for the partial transpose with respect to subsystem @xmath6 and @xmath49 is the trace norm . for proving this statement we write the entries of the density matrix of the state ( [ eq : basic state ] ) in the full hilbert space @xmath50 as a matter of fact",
    ", the operation of partial transposition introduces non vanishing matrix elements outside the set of pair basis states , obtaining @xmath51 besides the diagonal part of @xmath52 that is left unchanged , the matrix @xmath48 displays @xmath1 blocks for every pair @xmath53 in the subspace formed by the two basis vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the eigenvalues of such blocks turn out to be pairs of opposite numbers @xmath56 , signaling the presence of entanglement due to a negative eigenvalue .",
    "so , the negativity for pure pair states amounts to @xmath57 , which is a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement , being zero only for factorizable states .",
    "mixtures of pure states in the same pair basis , define a large nontrivial subset of the full hilbert space , described by density matrices depending on @xmath58 independent parameters .",
    "a fundamental property of the negativity is that it represents an entanglement monotone under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) for every mixed state in arbitrary dimension @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath59 for an arbitrary locc @xmath60 . moreover , given that a mixed state is a convex combination of pure states @xmath61 , the negativity is in general a convex function , i.e. @xmath62 , with weights obeying to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 .    for a mixed pair state @xmath66 ,",
    "a convex combination of pure states in a pair basis ( [ eq : basic state ] ) , the negativity becomes @xmath67 which turns out to be a good measure of entanglement for our class of states , since @xmath68 is convex and vanishes only in absence of off - diagonal terms of @xmath66 , i.e. for factorizable states . in other words",
    ", this proves that a _",
    "necessary _ and _ sufficient _ condition for having entanglement is the non vanishing of negativity , a property which is not valid for general states . in addition , the monotonicity of @xmath69 introduces a ordering in terms of entanglement content . despite its simplicity , eq.([eq : neg_our ] ) constitutes an important result , which may reveal of great utility in the evaluation of entanglement in several systems expressable in a pair basis . along the same line",
    ", one can compute the logarithmic negativity @xmath70 , which bounds the distillable entanglement of @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the eof @xmath71 is in general defined as the convex roof @xmath72 that gives the minimum average entropy over all possible decompositions of @xmath73 into pure states @xmath74 , @xmath75 , with weights @xmath76 .",
    "the calculation of ( [ eq : eof ] ) for general states is notoriously a formidable task .",
    "however , for our class of states we are able to establish some tight lower bounds of @xmath77 of evident use in a variety of applications .    in our case , the task is somewhat facilitated by the crucial property that the element @xmath74 of every decomposition must also be restricted to the same pair basis as @xmath52 .",
    "in fact , the diagonal elements @xmath78 for @xmath79 , can only result from a convex combination of zero diagonal elements @xmath80 for any @xmath81 , since they can not be negative by definition , as well as the weigths @xmath76 . as a consequence ,",
    "even the off - diagonal elements of @xmath82 that lie outside the pair basis are zero .    the entanglement of any pure state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : basic state ] ) is determined by @xmath83 parameters , the schmidt weights @xmath84 , plus the normalization condition .",
    "as known , these coefficients can not be inferred by the partial trace in the mixed case . instead , we want to relate them to the off - diagonal entries of @xmath66 .",
    "after relabeling the states such that @xmath85 ( hence @xmath86 ) , it holds that @xmath87 where @xmath88 and all @xmath89 except @xmath90 if @xmath91 . of course , for pure states the quantities @xmath92 are overdetermined , so there are many ways to take @xmath83 of them which are independent .",
    "one way to avoid such an overdetermination is to consider only the first row of the density matrix , obtaining @xmath93 , and @xmath94 as in eq.([eq : mu_i alt ] ) .",
    "now , we are able to find a lower bound to the eof , by means of the following :    [ [ theorem ] ] theorem + + + + + + + +    for every pair state described by a density matrix @xmath52 in the relabeled basis with @xmath86 , it holds @xmath95 where @xmath96 and the components of the vector @xmath97 are the @xmath83 off - diagonal elements in the first row of @xmath52 , which act as independent parameters .",
    "[ [ proof ] ] proof + + + + +    let us assume that there exist an optimal decomposition of @xmath73 formed by an ensemble of pure states @xmath98 , where each @xmath99 must belong to the same pair basis set , as discussed above . to any state @xmath99 of the decomposition , we associate a set of vectors @xmath100 and exact schmidt weights @xmath101 , as given by eqs.([eq : mu_i alt ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma_i ] ) .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of @xmath52 contained in @xmath102 are given by the convex sum @xmath103 .",
    "it follows that the eof is lower bounded by @xmath104 because @xmath105 the first inequality has been obtained by observing that @xmath106 $ ] , we get @xmath107\\geq\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\sqrt{1-z}\\right)\\log\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\sqrt{1-z}\\right)\\right]$ ] , that gives a lower bound for the first term in the sum in ( [ eq : lb_eof ] ) , and eliminates the problem of determining the sign @xmath108 .",
    "this latter inequality is also crucial to compensate the increase of the second term in the sum , when @xmath109 .",
    "the second inequality in ( [ eq : lb_eof ] ) holds thanks to the convexity of @xmath104 over its domain @xmath110$]}. after observing that @xmath111 depends only on the moduli of the components of @xmath112 , we get @xmath113 where the first inequality comes from the convexity of @xmath114 as a function of a real positive vector @xmath115 , such that @xmath116 $ ] , while the second inequality is a consequence of the triangular inequality @xmath117 , with @xmath118 and the monotonicity of @xmath114 with respect to any of its components .",
    "the latter property can be directly proven by calculating @xmath119 $ ] and showing that all its components are non negative for @xmath116 $ ] ( see appendix [ convf ] ) .",
    "proving that @xmath114 is convex for any @xmath42 by checking directly the positiveness of its hessian @xmath120 $ ] can be a hard task . by means of a mathematical stratagem",
    "we have found a way to write eq.([eq : f(x ) ] ) as a sum of convex functions @xmath121 , where each @xmath122 explicitly depends only on the two variables @xmath123 and @xmath124 , whose convexity is analytically proven through ordinary calculus methods ( see appendix [ convf ] ) .",
    "this shows that @xmath114 is indeed convex in every dimension .",
    "@xmath125    a step further in the seek of lower bounds for the eof can be made by defining the function @xmath126 in a similar way as @xmath104 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f(x ) ] ) and ( [ eq : alphas ] ) , but with @xmath127 where @xmath128 . in this new definition",
    "the number of independent variables is increased to @xmath129 .",
    "unfortunately , the function @xmath130 is not convex over all its domain , a property that would be a sufficient condition for proving its validity as a lower bound for eof , like in the previous theorem .",
    "however , strictly speaking we need only the weaker property of convexity with respect to the set of pure states ( as opposed to the overall set of density matrices ) .",
    "this latter feature is indeed displayed by @xmath130 , though it seems to be rather hard to prove it analytically .",
    "instead , we provide a stochastic demonstration by generating several samples of @xmath52 through random mixtures of pure states @xmath131 with uniformly distributed @xmath132 and coefficients of @xmath99 .",
    "we have numerically checked that the average entropy @xmath133 of every sampled decomposition is always larger than the lower bound @xmath130 , calculated directly from the matrix elements of @xmath52 . without loss of generality , we have generated pure states of the form ( [ eq : basic state ] ) with real positive coefficients , i.e. pure state decompositions which are closer to the optimal one ( that we do not know ) thank to the triangular inequality and because the entropy depends only on the absolute value of the entries of @xmath52 .",

    "<S> the unambiguous detection and quantification of entanglement is a hot topic of scientific research , though it is limited to low dimensions or specific classes of states . here </S>",
    "<S> we identify an additional class of quantum states , for which bipartite entanglement measures can be efficiently computed , providing new rigorous results . </S>",
    "<S> such states are written in arbitrary @xmath0 dimensions , where each basis state in the subsystem a is paired with only one state in b. this new class , that we refer to as _ pair basis states _ , is remarkably relevant in many physical situations , including quantum optics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that negativity is a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement for mixtures of states written in the same pair basis . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide analytical expressions for a tight lower - bound estimation of the entanglement of formation , a central quantity in quantum information .    quantum entanglement , after having been considered for many years a peculiar aspect of quantum mechanics whose interest was limited to specialists in foundations in quantum mechanics @xcite , has assumed a pervasive role in contemporary science with applications that range from cosmology @xcite to biology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it attracts a considerable interest being a fundamental resource for quantum technologies . </S>",
    "<S> this widespread relevance prompted the need of its unambiguous detection and quantification , a result still largely unachieved @xcite and recently subject to a large theoretical effort @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , while bipartite entanglement in a pure state can be estimated using the von neumann entropy as well as other measures , the problem of its evaluation is still open in the case of a general mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> a significant step forward has been done with the proof that that the bipartite entanglement in a general mixed state of a system of dimension @xmath1 is suitably quantified by the concurrence @xcite . in @xmath0 dimensions , with @xmath2 @xcite , a suitable measure has not yet been found except in the presence of special symmetries , like in the case of werner states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a computable entanglement monotone in arbitrary dimension is the negativity @xcite , which can be evaluated for different physical systems @xcite , but in general it represents only a sufficient condition for entanglement .    from the perspective of quantum information , it is helpful to evaluate the entanglement of formation ( eof ) , a faithful measure that quantifies the minimal entanglement resources needed to prepare a given state , in terms of bell pairs . at variance with the negativity , </S>",
    "<S> the eof is typically hard to calculate , as it is obtained from an optimization problem that only in some special cases can be solved analytically @xcite . sometimes , in higher dimensional system ( when exact eof is impractical to evaluate ) , it is convenient to determine a lower bound to eof which sets the amount of resources that are _ at least _ </S>",
    "<S> present inside the quantum state in consideration . </S>",
    "<S> of course , such a lower bound should be as tight as possible , in order to be useful .    </S>",
    "<S> we define the set of pure _ pair basis _ states of a bipartite system in arbitrary dimension @xmath0 as the set of states of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are _ fixed _ orthonormal basis for hilbert spaces of part @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath8 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , every pure state can be expressed in the form ( [ eq : basic state ] ) , through the schmidt decomposition and arbitrary assignment of phase factors to every @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the peculiarity of this set is that all the states belonging to it share the _ same _ basis , where each element @xmath11 in @xmath6 is paired with only one @xmath12 in @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this represents a subset of the most general bipartite case , where quantum states of a given ensemble may have different ( pair ) basis after schmidt decomposition .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we address the problem of evaluating the entanglement of mixtures of states written in a pair basis ( [ eq : basic state ] ) , identifying suitable measures . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we estimate rigorous and numerical lower bounds to the eof , comparing them to other estimates proposed in the literature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> pair basis states occur in a variety of physical situations , the most remarkable one being represented by two - mode gaussian states in quantum optics @xcite , that include twin - beam states , a key element of quantum communication , metrology and sensing . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , also non - gaussian states are included in the family of states of eq.(1 ) , like for example a twin beam plus a dephased component or mixtures of photon subtracted states . </S>",
    "<S> for these latter cases , that are relevant in many modern experiments of quantum mechanics @xcite , good measures of entanglement have not been found , so far . moreover , pair basis states are a natural way to explore high - dimensional entanglement , recently observed in spatial modes of pairs of down - converted photons @xcite . in atomic physics , bosonic atoms trapped in double wells </S>",
    "<S> have the same structure ( [ eq : basic state ] ) where the conservation of the total number @xmath13 imposes that each state @xmath14 of @xmath15 bosons in one well is paired with the state @xmath16 in the other well . also for electron models in a lattice may be interesting to restrict the total hilbert space of two - sites to the pair basis @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , i.e. the sector of zero magnetization and two electrons , thanks to the presence of special quantum numbers . </S>"
