    "in 1971 , makanin @xcite gave an algorithm for computing a generating set of the centralizer @xmath5 of any given element @xmath6 of the @xmath0-string braid group @xmath7 .",
    "his method , however , tends to yield very large , and highly redundant generating sets .",
    "one hint that much smaller generating sets could be found came from the experimental results of gonzlez - meneses and franco , which were obtained with a radically improved version of makanin s algorithm , based on new theoretical work @xcite . also , it has probably been clear to specialists for a long time that nielsen - thurston theory could be used to improve upon makanin s results .",
    "however , there seems to be no such result in the literature , and the aim of the present paper is to fill this gap .",
    "although our main interest was to compute , for any given @xmath8 , a small generating set of @xmath5 , we succeed in describing this centralizer in terms of semidirect and direct products of _ mixed braid groups _ ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "these groups are defined as follows : let @xmath9 be the base points of the braids in @xmath7 . given a partition @xmath10 of @xmath11 , the mixed braid group @xmath12 consists of those braids whose associated permutation preserves each coset of @xmath10 .",
    "the well known classification of mapping classes of a punctured surface into periodic , reducible and pseudo - anosov ones , yields an analogous classification for braids .",
    "if @xmath6 is reducible , then one can decompose it , in a certain sense , into a _",
    "tubular braid _ @xmath13 , and some _ interior braids _",
    "@xmath14},\\ldots , \\beta_{[t]}$ ] , all of them having less than @xmath0 stands .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following :    [ t : main1 ] let @xmath8 .",
    "one has :    1 .   if @xmath6 is pseudo - anosov , then @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath6 is periodic , then @xmath5 is either @xmath7 or isomorphic to a braid group on an annulus .",
    "if @xmath6 is reducible , then there exists a split exact sequence : @xmath16})\\times \\cdots \\times z(\\beta_{[t ] } ) \\longrightarrow z(\\beta ) \\longrightarrow z_0(\\widehat{\\beta})\\longrightarrow 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a subgroup of @xmath18 , isomorphic either to @xmath19 or to a mixed braid group .",
    "notice that @xmath20 , also @xmath21 , and finally the braid group over an annulus on @xmath22 strands is isomorphic to @xmath23 .",
    "hence all these groups can be seen as mixed braid groups .",
    "then , by recurrence on the number of strands we deduce the following :    for every @xmath8 , the centralizer @xmath5 can be expressed in terms of semidirect and direct products of mixed braid groups .    using the above structure we shall construct , for any braid @xmath8 , a generating set of @xmath5 having very few elements .",
    "more precisely , we obtain :    [ t : main ] if @xmath8 , then the centralizer @xmath5 can be generated by at most @xmath1 elements if @xmath2 , and at most @xmath3 elements if @xmath4 .",
    "we will present an example , communicated to us by s. j. lee , showing that the above bound is sharp .",
    "that is , we will define , for every positive integer @xmath0 , a braid in @xmath7 whose centralizer can not be generated by less than @xmath1 elements if @xmath2 , or less than @xmath3 elements if @xmath4 .",
    "( the first to observe that the number of generators of the centralizer may grow quadratically with the number of strands was n.v.ivanov @xcite . )",
    "however , the above bound refers to the worst case , and one could be interested in the minimal number of generators of a particular braid .",
    "we shall give a generating set which is in some sense the smallest `` natural '' generating set for the centralizer of a braid .",
    "however , we shall also give an example that illustrates the difficulty of finding the absolutely minimum possible number of generators .",
    "let us mention that , for the special case of reducible braids conjugated to a generator @xmath24 , its centralizer has already been described in  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ s : nith ] we set up notation and some standard machinery , and give the mentioned example by s.  j.  lee . in section  [ s : per ] we study @xmath5 in the case where @xmath6 is periodic , section  [ s : pa ] deals with the case , and section  [ s : red ] the reducible one , which is the most involved . in section  [ s : upperbound ]",
    "we define a generating set which is no larger than the stated upper bound . in section  [",
    "s : minimal ] we describe a generating set which is as small as possible while still reflecting the geometric structure of the nielsen - thurston decomposition .",
    "we also give an example to show that by algebraic trickery , even smaller sets can be obtained .",
    "finally in section  [ s : alg ] we discuss how the generating set that we defined can be found algorithmically .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 the closed disk of radius @xmath26 centered at @xmath27 in the complex plane . for any @xmath28 , the disk @xmath25 ,",
    "together with any choice of @xmath0 distinct points in its interior , is denoted @xmath29 , and the distinguished points are called the _",
    "punctures_. we shall use different choices for the exact position of the punctures at different times - they may be lined up on the real axis , or regularly distributed on a circle of radius @xmath30 , or again one of them may be in the centre while the remaining @xmath31 are distributed over the circle of radius @xmath30 . in most instances ,",
    "the position of the punctures is irrelevant , and we shall leave it unspecified .",
    "we recall that the braid group @xmath7 is the group of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms fixing ( pointwise ) the boundary and permuting the punctures of @xmath29 . here",
    "the isotopies must fix pointwise the boundary and the punctures .",
    "alternatively , @xmath7 could be defined as the group of isotopy classes of disjoint movements of the punctures , starting and ending with the configuration of @xmath29 .",
    "yet another definition of @xmath7 is as the set of isotopy classes of braids with @xmath0 strings in the cylinder @xmath32 $ ] , where the start and end points of the strings are exactly the puncture points in @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we shall use all three points of view .",
    "we shall often work with a certain quotient of the group @xmath7 , rather than with @xmath7 itself .",
    "we recall that the center of @xmath7 is isomorphic to the integers , and generated by the full twist @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is garside s half twist ) .",
    "geometrically , the group projection @xmath37 is given by smashing the boundary curve of @xmath29 to a puncture , so that @xmath38 is naturally a subgroup of the mapping class group of the sphere with @xmath39 punctures . in order to keep notation manageable",
    ", we shall use the same letters for elements of the braid group @xmath7 and for their image in the quotient @xmath38 .",
    "this abuse of notation should not cause confusion .",
    "we say that an element @xmath8 is _ periodic _ if the element of @xmath38 represented by @xmath6 is of finite order .",
    "equivalently , @xmath6 is periodic if there exists a @xmath40 such that in @xmath7 we have that @xmath41 is equal to some power of @xmath35 .",
    "we say an element @xmath6 of @xmath7 is _ reducible _ if there exists a nonempty multicurve @xmath42 in @xmath29 ( i.e.  a system of disjoint simple closed curves in @xmath29 , none of them isotopic to the boundary or enclosing a single puncture ) which is stabilized by @xmath6 , i.e.  such that @xmath43 is isotopic to @xmath42 . note that @xmath6 may permute different components of the multicurve @xmath42 .",
    "the following definition is taken from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . to every reducible braid @xmath8",
    "one can associate a canonical invariant multicurve : its _ canonical reduction system _ , which by definition is the collection of all isotopy classes @xmath44 of simple closed curves which have the following two properties : firstly , @xmath44 must be stabilized by some power of @xmath6 , and secondly any simple closed curve which has non - zero geometric intersection number with @xmath44 must _ not _ be stabilized by any power of @xmath6 . for instance , let us consider the punctured disk @xmath45 , where the 6 punctures are arranged uniformly on the circle of radius @xmath30 around @xmath27 .",
    "then the rotation of the punctures around the circle by an angle of @xmath46 is a periodic element of @xmath47 ( of period @xmath48 ) , it is also reducible ( e.g.  the three simple closed curves encircling punctures 1 and 2 , 3 and 4 , and 5 and 6 respectively form an invariant multicurve ) , but its canonical reduction system is empty .",
    "this example , however , is somewhat untypical : if a _",
    "non - periodic _ braid is reducible , then its canonical reduction system is nonempty ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath42 is an invariant multicurve of a reducible braid @xmath6 , then we define the _ tubular braid _ induced by @xmath6 and @xmath42 to be the braid on fewer strings obtained from @xmath6 by removing from @xmath29 all the disks bounded by outermost curves of @xmath42 , and collapsing each outermost curve of @xmath42 to a puncture point .",
    "it should be stressed that this braid is only defined up to conjugacy .    an alternative way to look at",
    "the same defintion is the following : let us consider again @xmath6 as an isotopy class of @xmath0 disjoint strings in @xmath32 $ ] with extremal points at the puncture points of @xmath49 and @xmath34 , such that each disk @xmath50 intersects each string exactly once .",
    "now our picture can be completed by embedded cylinders in @xmath32 $ ] which are disjoint from each other and from the strings of the braid , each of which intersects each disk @xmath50 in exactly one circle , and whose boundary components are exactly the outermost curves of @xmath42 in @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we can interpret the solid cylinders bounded by these cylinders as `` fat strings '' , and the resulting braid with some fat strings is exactly the tubular braid defined above .    the _ interior _ braids induced by @xmath6 and @xmath42 are the braids on fewer strings induced by @xmath6 at the interior of the discs bounded by the outermost curves of @xmath42 .",
    "they can be thought of as the braids ` inside ' the tubes of the tubular braid .",
    "therefore , for every reducible braid @xmath6 , and every invariant multicurve @xmath42 , we can decompose @xmath6 into one tubular braid and some interior braids  as many as the number of outermost curves in @xmath42 .",
    "finally , we have the notion of a _ _ element of @xmath7 , for which we refer to @xcite or @xcite . roughly speaking , @xmath8 is if it is represented by a homeomorphism of @xmath29 which preserves two transverse measured foliations on @xmath29 ( called the `` stable '' and the `` unstable '' foliation ) , while scaling the measure of the unstable one by some factor @xmath53 which is greater than 1 , and the measure of the stable one by @xmath54 .",
    "thurston s theorem @xcite states that every irreducible element of @xmath7 is either periodic or pseudo - anosov .",
    "we end this section with the promised example , due to s. j. lee , that should be helpful for understanding the relationship between the nielsen - thurston decomposition and the centralizer subgroup of a braid @xmath8 .",
    "this example was also found independently by n. v. ivanov and h. hamidi - tehrani  @xcite .",
    "[ e : purebraid ] suppose that @xmath55 , and denote by @xmath24 the standard generator of @xmath7 , in which the @xmath56th and the @xmath57st punctures permute their positions in a clockwise sense .",
    "we define @xmath58 .",
    "the canonical reduction system of @xmath6 consists of @xmath59 circles , the @xmath56th one enclosing the punctures @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding tubular braid is the trivial braid of @xmath62 , and the interior braids are , respectively , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ,  , @xmath65 ( notice that all of them are non - conjugate , since conjugate braids have the same exponent sum ) .",
    "let @xmath66 be the disks bounded by the above circles .",
    "as we shall see , any braid that commutes with @xmath6 has to send each disk @xmath67 to itself ( since the interior braids are non - conjugate ) .",
    "a generating set of the centralizer subgroup of @xmath6 is given by    1 .",
    "for each @xmath68 , the braid @xmath69 , whose support is contained in @xmath67 , 2 .",
    "any generating set for the pure braid group on @xmath59 strings @xmath70 all the generators here act as the identity on @xmath71 , and can be seen as a pure tubular braid on @xmath59 strings ( tubes ) , where the @xmath56th tube starts and ends at @xmath67 .",
    "it can be easily shown that , in this case , @xmath72 .",
    "the essential observation now is the following : it can be deduced by the presentation given in  @xcite , that the abelianization of @xmath70 is isomorphic to @xmath73 ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the abelianization of @xmath5 is isomorphic to @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , at least @xmath75 generators are needed for the centralizer of the braid @xmath6 .",
    "the case when @xmath76 is analogous .",
    "the braid proposed by s. j. lee is : @xmath77 .",
    "this time the first strand is not enclosed by any curve of the canonical reduction system of @xmath6 , and one has : @xmath78 .",
    "hence , in this case the minimal possible number of generators is @xmath79 .    by proving theorem  [ t : main ]",
    ", we will show that the above examples are the worst one can find .",
    "we have to start by describing the periodic elements of @xmath7 . in order to state this classification result , which is classical , we need to define two braids .",
    "if @xmath29 is the disk with @xmath0 punctures arranged regularly on the circle of radius @xmath30 , then the braid which we shall call @xmath80 is represented by a clockwise movement of all punctures on this circle by an angle @xmath81 . if no confusion is possible , we shall simply write @xmath82 , without indicating the number of strands ( note that this braid is the garside element of the birman - ko - lee structure of @xmath7  @xcite ) .    similarly , if we think of @xmath83 as having one puncture in the centre , and @xmath31 punctures arranged circularly around it , then we define @xmath84 to be the braid given by a circular movement of the @xmath31 punctures by an angle of @xmath85 , while leaving the central puncture fixed . again , for simplicity we shall often only write @xmath86 instead of @xmath87 .",
    "the result that classifies periodic braids , which is due to eilenberg @xcite and de  kerkjrt @xcite ( see  @xcite for a modern exposition ) is :    [ l : per_gamma_delta ] every periodic braid in @xmath7 is conjugate to a power of @xmath80 or @xmath87 .",
    "thus we only need to consider the centralizer subgroups of @xmath88 and @xmath89 for all @xmath90 , since the centralizers of conjugate elements are isomorphic by an inner automorphism of @xmath7 .",
    "this problem has been solved by bessis , digne and michel  @xcite , on the wider context of complex reflexion groups .",
    "we shall explain their result in the particular case of braid groups :    we suppose first that @xmath91 where , without loss of generality , @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 . for @xmath94 , we will denote @xmath95 the punctures of @xmath29 , so @xmath91 sends @xmath96 to @xmath97 for every @xmath98 ( the indices are taken modulo @xmath0 ) . hence the permutation induced by @xmath6",
    "has @xmath99 orbits ( cycles ) of length @xmath100 , that we denote by @xmath101 .",
    "see in figure  [ f : delta_orbits ] an example where @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 : the braid @xmath106 and the three orbits of @xmath107 .    if @xmath108 ( that is if @xmath109 ) , consider the once punctured disc @xmath110 , and the @xmath111sheeted covering @xmath112 defined by @xmath113 . the orbits @xmath114 are sent by @xmath115 to the points @xmath116 , where @xmath117 .",
    "if we consider the half - line @xmath1180,2]\\}$ ] ( notice that @xmath119 passes between @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) , then @xmath122 is a fundamental region for @xmath115 ( see figure  [ f : theta ] ) .",
    "now notice that every braid in @xmath123 can be lifted , by @xmath124 , to a braid in @xmath7 in a natural way .",
    "the resulting braid is a @xmath125-symmetric braid , that is , it is invariant under a rotation by an angle of @xmath126 .",
    "but then it is also invariant under a rotation of angle @xmath127 ; in other words , the resulting braid commutes with @xmath6 .",
    "hence we have a natural homomorphism : @xmath128 whose image is contained in @xmath5",
    ". then one has    [ t : centrdelta ] the natural homomorphism @xmath129 is an isomorphism .",
    "in other words , every element in the centralizer of @xmath91 can be seen ( via @xmath115 ) as a braid on a once punctured disc , that is , a braid on an annulus .",
    "notice that if @xmath130 ( that is , if @xmath22 is a multiple of @xmath0 ) , then @xmath6 is a power of @xmath131 . in this case",
    "@xmath115 is the identity map , and the fundamental region is the whole @xmath29 .",
    "hence the centralizer of @xmath6 is the whole @xmath7 , as one should expect .",
    "since we are interested in minimising the set of generators , we observe that if @xmath132 ( thus @xmath130 ) , then @xmath133 is generated by two elements , namely artin s @xmath63 and birman - ko - lee s @xmath82 . in a similar way ,",
    "if @xmath134 , then the braid group @xmath123 is generated by just two elements , namely @xmath135 and the braid @xmath136 shown in figure [ f : gendelgam](a ) . notice that this case contains the above one , where @xmath137 is the identity . finally , if @xmath138 then @xmath139 is cyclic .",
    "thus we have :    [ p : centrdelta ] if @xmath22 and @xmath0 are coprime , then @xmath140 is generated by a single element , namely @xmath80 . if , by contrast , @xmath141 , then @xmath140 is generated by two elements : @xmath80 and the braid @xmath136",
    "it is clear that the generating set given by proposition  [ p : centrdelta ] is indeed minimal .",
    "next we study the centralizer of @xmath142 , still following the work in @xcite .",
    "this time we call @xmath143 , and @xmath144 .",
    "if @xmath145 , the above map @xmath115 induces a natural homomorphism @xmath146 , where this time the central point of @xmath25 is considered as a puncture .",
    "hence , the central strand of every braid coming from @xmath123 is trivial .",
    "we observe that the image of this homomorphism is contained in @xmath5 , and in fact one has :    [ t : centrdelta2 ] the natural homomorphism @xmath147 is an isomorphism .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath148 , then @xmath6 is a power of @xmath149 , so @xmath150 , @xmath133 and everything works as above .",
    "hence we have    [ p : centrgamma ] if @xmath22 and @xmath31 are coprime , then @xmath151 is generated by a single element , namely @xmath87 . if , by contrast , @xmath152 , then @xmath151 is generated by two elements : @xmath153 and the braid @xmath154",
    ".    see figure [ f : gendelgam](b ) for an illustration of the braid @xmath154 .",
    "we summarize all the results in this section as follows :    the centralizer of any periodic braid in @xmath7 either equals @xmath7 or is isomorphic to @xmath123 , for some @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , it can be generated by at most two elements .",
    "we end with a result that will be helpful later :    [ c : addstring ] if @xmath22 is not a multiple of @xmath0 , then @xmath155 .",
    "both groups are isomorphic to @xmath123 , where @xmath156 .",
    "an actual isomorphism can be defined as follows : take any element @xmath157 , isotope it to make it @xmath127-symmetric , and then add a trivial strand based at the central point of @xmath29 .",
    "[ p : pa ] if @xmath8 is pseudo - anosov , then the centralizer of @xmath7 is free abelian and generated by two elements : some @xmath158 which has the same stable and unstable projective measured foliation as @xmath6 ( possibly @xmath6 itself ) , and one periodic braid @xmath159 ( a root of @xmath35 , possibly @xmath35 itself ) .",
    "we stress that the generating set promised by proposition [ p : pa ] is obviously minimal . for proving this result ,",
    "it is more convenient to think about the quotient group @xmath38 . since @xmath160 is the center of @xmath7 ,",
    "it is contained in the centralizer of any element .",
    "hence the centralizer of an element in @xmath7 is just the preimage of the centralizer of its corresponding mapping class in @xmath38 .",
    "thus , for the rest of this section , we shall work in this quotient @xmath38 ; we shall prove the following result , from which proposition [ p : pa ] will then be deduced :    [ p : pa ] if @xmath161 is , then the centralizer of @xmath6 is abelian , and is generated by some @xmath158 which has the same stable and unstable projective measured foliation as @xmath6 , and possibly one element @xmath159 of finite order .",
    "we start by observing that the element @xmath6 can not commute with any reducible element @xmath162 , except possibly with periodic ones ",
    "thus all elements of @xmath163 are either or periodic . to see this ,",
    "let us assume that the canonical reduction system @xmath42 of @xmath164 is non - empty .",
    "then the canonical reduction system of @xmath165 is @xmath43 . if it were true that @xmath166 , then we would have @xmath167 , which is impossible since it is well known that homeomorphisms do not stabilise any curves or multicurves .",
    "( this result is also a special case of corollary 7.13 of @xcite . )",
    "our next claim is that all pseudo - anosov elements in @xmath5 have the same stable and unstable projective measured foliations . in order to prove this",
    ", we can apply corollaries 7.15 and 8.4 of @xcite : since the centralizer subgroup of @xmath6 is infinite and irreducible , it follows that @xmath5 contains an infinte cyclic group as a subgroup of finite index .",
    "it follows that if @xmath164 is any element in the centralizer of @xmath6 , then there exist @xmath168 such that @xmath169 . since all powers of a element",
    "have the same stable and unstable projective measured foliation , it follows that @xmath164 has the same stable and unstable projective measured foliations as @xmath6 , and so do all elements of @xmath170 .",
    "next we make an essential observation which only works for braid groups , and does not generalize to mapping class groups of surfaces with no boundary , or with more than two boundary components : all elements of @xmath38 , regarded as a subgroup of the mapping class group of the @xmath39 times punctured sphere , fix the puncture which came from collapsing the boundary of @xmath29",
    ". moreover , there are singular leaves of the stable and unstable foliation of @xmath6 emanating from this puncture , at least one of each ( like for every other puncture ) . in the cyclic ordering around the puncture , singular leaves of the stable and unstable foliation alternate . if an element @xmath164 of @xmath38 commutes with @xmath6 , then the action of @xmath164 has to preserve the projective stable and unstable foliations .",
    "thus in the cyclic ordering around our preferred puncture , the action of @xmath164 can only induce a cyclic ( possibly trivial ) permutation of the singular leaves ( sending stable to stable , and unstable to unstable leaves , nevertheless ) .",
    "now we see that an element @xmath164 of @xmath170 is uniquely determined by just two data : firstly the stretch factor @xmath53 by which its action on the unstable measured foliation of @xmath6 multiplies the measure of that foliation .",
    "( this factor @xmath53 equals @xmath30 if @xmath164 is periodic , and belongs to the set @xmath171 if @xmath164 is ) . and",
    "secondly by the cyclic permutation of the leaves of the stable projective foliation emanating from the distinguished puncture of the @xmath39 times punctured sphere .",
    "indeed , if @xmath164 and @xmath172 share both data , then @xmath173 has stretch factor 1 ( so it is periodic ) , and preserves the singular leaves .",
    "hence it is the identity in @xmath38 , so @xmath174 .",
    "this implies that the set of periodic elements of @xmath5 forms a subgroup of @xmath5 which is either trivial or isomorphic to @xmath175 , where @xmath22 is a divisor of the number of singular leaves of the stable foliation emanating from the preferred puncture .",
    "any generator of this subgroup can play the rle of our desired generator @xmath159 of @xmath170 .",
    "now @xmath159 commutes with any other element in @xmath5 , because their commutator has stretch factor 1 and induces the trivial permutation of the prongs around the preferred singularity .",
    "now notice that the stretch factor yields a multiplicative map from @xmath5 to @xmath176 .",
    "but it is known that the set of possible stretch factors for a given foliation is discrete ( see  @xcite ) , so the image of @xmath5 under this map must be a cyclic subgroup of @xmath177 . take an element @xmath158 whose stretch factor @xmath53 generates this group .",
    "then @xmath158 is and the stretch factor of any element in @xmath5 must be a power of @xmath53 .",
    "we now have that @xmath158 and @xmath159 generate @xmath178 , because any element in @xmath5 can be multiplied by some power of @xmath158 so as to obtain an element with stretch factor @xmath30 , i.e.  a power of @xmath159 .",
    "it follows that @xmath163 is isomorphic to @xmath179 , with generators @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "this completes the proof of proposition [ p : pa ] .    by proposition  [ p : pa ]",
    ", @xmath163 is isomorphic to @xmath180 , with generators @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "but then @xmath181 is just the preimage of @xmath163 under the natural projection .",
    "consider the subgroup @xmath182 .",
    "its preimage is an infinte cyclic group in @xmath7 that contains @xmath160 .",
    "we can suppose ( up to choosing an appropriate @xmath159 ) , that the generator of this cyclic group projects to @xmath159 , so we call it @xmath159 as well",
    ". notice that @xmath159 is a root of @xmath35 , since @xmath35 belongs to @xmath183 .",
    "then we choose an element in @xmath7 that projects to @xmath158 , and we also call it @xmath158",
    ". we must prove that in @xmath7 we still have @xmath184 .",
    "but every element in @xmath181 can be written as @xmath185 .",

    "therefore , the result is true if @xmath643 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath138 .",
    "in this case @xmath661 and @xmath662 .",
    "then one has : @xmath663    if @xmath647 then @xmath648 and @xmath664 , so @xmath665 .",

    ". then @xmath671 .    finally , if @xmath672 then @xmath662 so @xmath673 .",
    "hence @xmath674 @xmath675 therefore , in every case @xmath676 , and theorem  [ t : main ] is proved .",
    "recall that , in example  [ e : purebraid ] , we defined braids of any number of strands whose centralizer could not be generated by less than @xmath607 elements .",
    "therefore , the bound given by theorem  [ t : main ] is the best possible one .",
    "we saw in the previous section an upper bound for the number of generators of the centralizer of a braid @xmath6 , in terms of its number of strings .",
    "but one could obtain a better bound if more information about @xmath6 is given . in this section we will define a new generating set @xmath677 for @xmath5 , which is in most cases smaller than the set @xmath601 defined before .",
    "it is also the smallest possible `` natural '' generating set , in the sense that each generator belongs to one of the @xmath678 factors in the semidirect product decomposition in theorem [ t : main1](c ) .",
    "thus in a philosophical sense , @xmath677 is the `` right '' generating set , even though it is not in general the smallest possible one , as we shall see at the end of this section .    if @xmath6 is periodic or , we already know a minimal generating set , with at most two elements .",
    "we also know a minimal generating set for any mixed braid group ( see the proof of proposition  [ p : genc_0 ] )",
    ". hence we can define @xmath677 by induction on the number of strands , when @xmath6 is a reducible , non - periodic braid .",
    "we can also suppose that @xmath6 is in regular form .",
    "we recall that the interior braids are denoted @xmath14},\\ldots , \\beta_{[t]}$ ] , and the tubular braid @xmath13 .",
    "we will say that @xmath320 are _ permutable _ if there exists some @xmath334 such that @xmath331 .",
    "remark that permutability is an equivalence relation , and the definition of @xmath679 says that if @xmath56 and @xmath318 are permutable then @xmath228}=\\beta_{[j]}$ ] .",

    "let @xmath681 be a minimal set of generators for @xmath682})$ ] , and @xmath603 be a minimal set of generators for @xmath17 .",
    "then we define @xmath683 .",
    "notice that @xmath684 , and they coincide if and only if there is no pair of permutable indices .",
    "@xmath677 is a generating set of @xmath5 .    from the exact sequence of theorem  [ t : exactseq ] it follows that , if @xmath685 is a set of generators for @xmath264})$ ] , then a set of generators for @xmath5 is @xmath686 .",
    "hence , we just need to show that if @xmath687 , then every element in @xmath688 can be written as a product of elements in @xmath677 .",
    "take then @xmath318 as above .",
    "there must be some @xmath689 permutable with @xmath318 , so @xmath229}=\\beta_{[i_k]}$ ] and there is some @xmath334 such that @xmath690 .",

    "hence the braid @xmath694 can be written as a product of elements in @xmath677 .",
    "moreover , one has @xmath695 , and the only nontrivial interior braids in @xmath158 are those corresponding to @xmath340 . since the interior braids @xmath696 for every @xmath455 are just powers of @xmath697}=\\beta_{[j]}$ ] , and @xmath86 commutes with @xmath229}$ ] , it follows that for every @xmath455 , @xmath698 .",
    "therefore @xmath699 , so every element in @xmath688 can be written as a product of elements in @xmath677 , thus @xmath677 is a generating set for @xmath5 .",
    "the generating set we have just defined is , unfortunately , not always the smallest possible one :    consider the five string braid @xmath700  the canonical reduction system of this braid has two round circles , one containing punctures number 1 , 2 and 3 , the other punctures number 4 and 5 ; the tubular braid is just a full twist of the two fat strings : @xmath701 .",
    "moreover , the interior braids of each tube is trivial . according to theorem [ t : main1 ] ,",
    "the centralizer of this braid is @xmath702 and the generating set constructed in this section has four elements : two for @xmath703 , and one for each factor @xmath704 .",
    "we now claim that this generating set is not as small as possible .",
    "indeed , @xmath705 can be generated by only two elements ( and thus @xmath5 can be generated by three elements ) . to see this , recall that the 3-string braid group is isomorphic to the group of the @xmath706-torus knot .",
    "thus @xmath703 has a presentation @xmath707 ( with @xmath708 and @xmath709 ) .",
    "moreover , the factor @xmath704 is generated by @xmath710 .",
    "now the two generators @xmath711 and @xmath712 generate @xmath713 , because @xmath714 can be written as @xmath715 .",
    "the aim of this section is to present the essential ingredients for an algorithm which , for any given braid , finds a generating set of its centralizer subgroup that matches the description of the previous sections . since , for any braid @xmath6 and any @xmath716 , the centralizer subgroups of @xmath6 and @xmath717 coincide , we can always assume that @xmath6 is positive .",
    "we start by mentioning that algorithms that perform the nielsen - thurston classification , and give the invariant folitations in the case ( in the form of train tracks ) , are available  notably , there are bestvina - haendel s @xcite and of los @xcite algorithms ; and computer implementations are available on the web @xcite .",
    "we recall briefly the idea of the two automatic structures on braid groups that are relevant for us : for the first one , given by garside @xcite and thurston @xcite ( and refined by el - rifai and morton @xcite ) , we think of @xmath29 has having the @xmath0 punctures lined up on the real line in the disk @xmath25 . for the second one , given by birman , ko , and lee @xcite",
    ", we think of @xmath7 as having the @xmath0 punctures regularly spaced on the circle of radius @xmath30 . apart from that ,",
    "the structures are exactly analogue . in the garside - thurston structure",
    ", there is a canonical way to write @xmath6 as a product of divisors of @xmath36 , namely by pushing each crossing between two strings into a factor as far to the left as possible .",
    "this normal form is called the _ left greedy normal form_. for instance , in this normal form all factors which are _ equal _ to @xmath36 ( not just divisors of it ) are grouped together at the very left of the product decomposition .",
    "analogously , birman - ko - lee write each braid as a product of divisors of @xmath82 in a left - greedy way .",
    "if @xmath6 is a positive braid , then its _ super summit set _ is the subset of all elements @xmath158 of its conjugacy class which satisfy the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath158 is positive , 2 .",
    "the writing of @xmath158 in left greedy normal form has as few factors as possible among all elements satisfying ( i ) , 3 .",
    "the writing of of @xmath158 in left greedy normal form has as many factors on the left as possible equal to @xmath36 ( or @xmath82 ) , among all elements satisfying ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "two positive elements of @xmath7 are conjugate if and only if their super summit sets coincide .",
    "given @xmath8 there is an algorithm , given in  @xcite ( which is an improvement of the algorithm in  @xcite ) , to compute its super summit set .",
    "it is as follows : first we repeatedly _ cycle _ @xmath6 ( i.e.  move the first factor different from @xmath36 , respectively @xmath82 , to the end and calculate the left greedy form of the resulting braid ) , until this process runs into a loop . at this point",
    "we are guaranteed to have achieved condition ( ii ) above",
    ". then we repeatedly _ decycle _",
    "( i.e.  move the last factor to the front and calculate the left greedy form of the resulting braid ) until we run into a loop .",
    "then all elements of this loop belong to the super summit set .",
    "afterwards , all other elements of the super summit set can be found recursively by conjugating already known elements by ( suitable ) divisors of @xmath36 ( respectively @xmath82 ) , and retaining the result if it belongs to the super summit set .",
    "this algorithm for computing the super summit set is necessary for our purposes .",
    "now suppose we are given a braid @xmath8 and we want to compute its centralizer .",
    "first we need to determine if @xmath6 is periodic , reducible or , and then we can use the results in this paper .    very recently ,",
    "v. gebhardt  @xcite presented a better algorithm for the conjugacy problem in braid groups .",
    "he defined the _ ultra summit set _ , which is in general much smaller than the super summit set described here .",
    "deciding whether a given element @xmath6 of @xmath7 is periodic is very easy : one calculates the @xmath31st and the @xmath0th power of @xmath6",
    ". then @xmath6 is periodic if and only if one of the two results is a power of @xmath35 .    if @xmath718 for some @xmath40 , then @xmath6 is conjugate to @xmath89 ( as can be easily seen from lemma  [ l : per_gamma_delta ] ) , and a conjugating element can be found explicitly using either of the two standard algorithms .",
    "similarly , if @xmath719 , then @xmath6 is conjugate to @xmath88 , and either algorithm yields an explicit conjugating element . in either case , one can find explicitly a generating set of the centralizer subgroup with only two elements , using propositions [ p : centrdelta ] or [ p : centrgamma ] .    after establishing that an element @xmath6 of @xmath7 is not periodic , we need to check whether it is reducible , and if it is , we want to find explicitly an invariant multicurve .",
    "this is , in fact , a standard part of bestvina - haendel s @xcite and of los @xcite algorithms .",
    "we want to point out one particulary elegant alternative , which is due to benardete , gutierrez and nitecki @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we think of @xmath29 as having the @xmath0 punctures lined up horizontally , and we look at garside - thurston s left greedy normal form .",
    "the key observation from @xcite is the following : suppose that @xmath42 is an invariant multicurve of a braid @xmath6 , and that the normal form of @xmath6 is @xmath720 , where @xmath721 are divisors of @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , suppose that all components of @xmath42 are _ round _",
    "( i.e.  actual geometric circles in @xmath29 ) .",
    "then we have not only that @xmath722 , but also that all components of all the multicurves @xmath723 are round for @xmath724 .",
    "as remarked in @xcite this implies as a corollary that invariant multicurves are visible as round curves in the super summit set of @xmath6 , and in particular the reducibilty of a braid is easily detectable from the super summit set . to prove the corollary we note that @xmath6 has a conjugate in which all components of the curve system @xmath42 are round ; moreover , @xmath6 and its conjugate have the same super summit set . now cycling and decycling this conjugate",
    "does not change the fact that there is a _ round _ invariant curve system , by the key observation above . at the end of the cycling / decycling procedure",
    "we have found elements of the super summit set which contain the desired round invariant curves .    now it is shown in  @xcite how to determine if a given braid preserves a system of disjoint round curves .",
    "and there is a finite number of these systems .",
    "moreover , since for each element of the super summit set we know how it can be conjugated to obtain @xmath6 , we can find explicitly all curves that belong to a reduction system for @xmath6 .",
    "we can then easily determine , by its definition , which of these curves belong to the canonical reduction system of @xmath6 .",
    "that is , we can compute the canonical reduction system of @xmath6 .",
    "we shall think of @xmath29 as having its @xmath0 punctures uniformly distributed over the circle of radius @xmath30 , and we consider birman - ko - lee s left - greedy normal form .",
    "we want to decide algorithmically whether @xmath6 is conjugate to a braid @xmath158 with the property that @xmath158 commutes with @xmath88 for some positive integer @xmath725",
    ". if it is , we want to know the conjugating braid explicitly .",
    "the following result yields such an algorithm .",
    "[ p : commdelta ] suppose that a braid @xmath6 has a conjugate which commutes with @xmath88 for some integer @xmath22 .",
    "then there exists an element @xmath158 of the super summit set of @xmath6 which has the property that @xmath158 , and in fact every factor of the left greedy normal form of @xmath158 , commutes with @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath726 be a conjugate of @xmath6 which commutes with @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath727 is the left - greedy normal form of @xmath726 , then each factor @xmath728 is a divisor of @xmath80 which is @xmath127-symmetric .",
    "this follows from the fact that the very definition of the left - greedy normal form is completely rotation symmetric .",
    "more precisely , the fact that two consecutive factors @xmath729 determine a left - greedy normal form is not modified by rotating them .",
    "hence , the product @xmath730 is in left - greedy normal form .",
    "since this product equals @xmath731 , whose left - greedy normal form is @xmath732 , we obtain that @xmath733 , for @xmath734",
    ".      now we notice that it is very easy to decide if a given divisor of @xmath82 ( in the birman - ko - lee context ) is invariant under a given rotation .",
    "hence one can determine if a braid commutes with an ( explicitly computable ) conjugate of @xmath88 by looking at the elements of its super summit set .",
    "now we want to determine if a given braid commutes with a conjugate of @xmath89 , for a given positive integer @xmath735 .",
    "this is only possible if there is some index @xmath736 such that @xmath6 preserves @xmath556 , as can be easily seen by looking at the corresponding permutations .",
    "call @xmath737 , a partition of @xmath738",
    ". then @xmath6 should belong to @xmath739 .",
    "there is a natural map @xmath740 which consists of forgetting the @xmath56th string .",
    "notice that , if a braid @xmath158 commutes with @xmath89 ( where @xmath741 is considered to be the central point of @xmath742 ) then @xmath743 commutes with @xmath744 .",
    "hence we have a necessary condition that must be satisfied .",
    "if @xmath6 preserves a puncture @xmath556 , then we conjugate it to some @xmath158 that preserves @xmath741 , and we test whether a conjugate of @xmath743 commutes with @xmath745 for some @xmath735 .",
    "if this does not happen , for @xmath746 , then no conjugate of @xmath6 commutes with @xmath89 .",
    "this necessary condition is of course not sufficient .",
    "a sufficient and testable condition is now given by the following result . recall that , by corollary  [ c : addstring ] , there is an isomorphism @xmath747 from @xmath748 to @xmath151 , given by adding a trivial string at the centre of @xmath749 .",
    "notice that , if @xmath750 , then @xmath751 .",
    "then one has :          for the implication ( i)@xmath756(ii ) , we suppose that ( i ) holds , that is , there is an element @xmath758 such that @xmath759 , where @xmath750",
    ". we can apply @xmath760 to all these elements , denoting @xmath761 and @xmath762 .",
    "this yields @xmath763 , where @xmath764 .",
    "let us then show that @xmath768 commutes with @xmath745 .",
    "notice that @xmath754 is a braid that commutes with @xmath89 .",
    "hence it preserves a projective foliation @xmath769 , which is invariant under a rotation by an angle of @xmath770 .",
    "but in this case @xmath771 also preserves @xmath769 , with the same stretch factor , hence it is also .",
    "since @xmath772 is conjugated to @xmath771 , then it is as well , and we call @xmath773 its corresponding projective foliation ( which is also invariant under the same rotation , since @xmath772 commutes with @xmath745 ) . since @xmath763 , we have that @xmath768 sends @xmath773 to @xmath769 .    now consider the braid @xmath774 .",
    "it is conjugate to @xmath745 , and hence periodic .",
    "moreover , it preserves @xmath769 , so it commutes with @xmath771 .",
    "but the periodic elements in the centralizer of @xmath771 form a cyclic group containing @xmath745 , and @xmath745 is the only element having exponent sum @xmath775 .",
    "since @xmath99 has exactly the same exponent sum , it follows that @xmath776 .",
    "hence @xmath768 commutes with @xmath777 , and the result follows .",
    "an algorithm for testing whether a braid @xmath6 is conjugate to a braid which commutes with @xmath89 is now easy to construct : for each of the @xmath0 punctures test whether the puncture is fixed by @xmath6 , and whether forgetting this puncture yields a braid which is conjugate to a braid @xmath778 that commutes with @xmath88 .",
    "( we know how to do this , by the results of the previous subsection ) .",
    "for each puncture that does satisfy this property , test whether @xmath755 ( which is obtained from @xmath778 by adding a `` trivial '' string in the centre ) , is conjugate to @xmath6 . if , for one of the punctures , this is the case , then the answer is `` yes '' , otherwise `` no '' .",
    "it remains to describe a last step for computing a generating set for @xmath5 , when @xmath6 is .",
    "we assume that we have already computed the subgroup @xmath183 of periodic braids commuting with @xmath6",
