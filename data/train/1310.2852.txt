    "whilst we are able to observe arm and bar structures in nearby galaxies , we remain ignorant as to the structure of our own galaxy , due to our unique position in the galactic disk . calculating the distances to sources in the galactic disk from their velocities is the primary way of mapping the galaxy s face - on structure , but it is fraught with difficulties and uncertainties , such as the distance ambiguity . as such we can not say with much certainty",
    "even how many spiral arms our galaxy has ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* valle 2008 ) and references therein ) .",
    "one way of avoiding the problems associated with converting velocities to distances is to map the velocity distribution of galactic sources as a function of galactic longitude .",
    "an illustration of the translation from spiral and bar positions in cartesian space into longitude - velocity ( _ l - v _ ) space is shown in fig . [",
    "arp : fig1 ] . by knowing the position of the observer and assuming some rotation curve we can create maps in _",
    "l - v _ space . in reality",
    "these features will be combined with emission from the galactic disk and the features may not directly translate from position to velocity space .",
    "for example , spiral shocks may cause the high density gas to be offset from the actual spiral perturbation .",
    "there exists in the literature numerous studies of the velocity structure of the galactic disk from different sources ( e.g. hi , cii , co , masers , hcn ) . of key interest is the velocity structure of hi and co gas .",
    "while hi is believed to be present throughout the galactic disk , co is a tracer of high density regions that coincide with the location of spiral and bar structure ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* kalberla et al .",

    "we could construct a top - down map of our galaxy , including the positions and shapes of spiral and bar features , but as mentioned converting from velocity to distance is difficult .",
    "one approach to inferring the structure of the galaxy from _",
    "l - v _ maps is to use hydrodynamical simulations to investigate which spiral and bar structures can reproduce the velocity structures seen in observations .",
    "velocity maps built from simulations provide all the spatial information of the gas , as well as its velocity .",
    "if it is possible to reproduce the observed _ l - v _ features in simulations then it can be inferred that the spiral / bar structures that produced these features are a good representation of those of our galaxy .",
    "this technique has been used in previous studies in an attempt to constrain specific milky way parameters , such as the bar s orientation ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* rodriguez - fernandez & combes , gmez & cox 2004 ) ) .",
    "so far , however , no work has been attempted to search a large parameter space of galactic spiral and bar features .",
    "the aim of the work presented here is to match the co and hi _",
    "l - v _ maps of our galaxy by running numerous hydrodynamical simulations of gases in the interstellar medium ( ism ) under the influence of spiral and bar perturbations with various pattern speeds , pitch angles , and orientations .",
    "a major difference to previous studies is that we construct synthetic _",
    "emission maps _ of hi and co rather than simply translating the positions in the hydrodynamical simulations into _",
    "l - v _ space ( as done in fig .",
    "[ arp : fig1 ] ) .",
    "we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) to simulate the flow of ism gas in the milky way .",
    "the ism gas is distributed in the galactic disk only , with a distribution that matches the surface density profile of gas observed in the milky way .",
    "each sph particle has a chemical abundance array that is updated along with the various hydrodynamical properties .",

    "phantom is a low - memory , highly efficient sph code written especially for studying non - self - gravitating problems .",
    "when using fixed analytic potentials the structure of the milky way is assumed to be that of a grand design , with the gas clearly tracing the shape of the potentials .",
    "the rotation curve of the milky way is reproduced using a combination of bulge , disk and halo potentials .",
    "we include several different potentials to represent the spiral arms ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the gravitational attraction of the star particles is felt by the star and gas particles , but only the gas is subject to the standard hydrodynamical forces .",

    "for the simulations shown here 90% of the sph particles are allocated to the gaseous disk , 9% to the stellar disk and 1% to the stellar bulge .    in fig .",
    "[ arp : fig3 ] we show an example of a simulation with a live stellar disk and bulge .",
    "this setup is more akin to a flocculent spiral galaxy .",
    "the live nature of the stellar component results in spiral structures that appear much weaker , transient and irregular compared to those imposed by analytic stellar potentials .",
    "while the number of primary arms tends to be steady throughout the simulation , the star particles inhabit spiral arms throughout the existence of the arms , as opposed to the density wave theory where material continually flows in and out of the spiral density waves .",

    "the barred galaxy in particular is a good match to the broad structure and peak velocities towards the galactic centre .",
    "the flocculent galaxy is lacking in the broad structure inside @xmath7 , however the resolution for the live disk / bulge simulations is somewhat lower than those with static disk / bulge potentials .",
    "conversely the hi of the 4-armed and barred galaxy is tracing the spiral / bar structure too clearly compared to observations .",
    "our synthetic co emission maps suffer the same problems as the hi maps , in that the emission is strongly confined to the spiral and bar structures .",
    "there is very little interarm emission in the grand design simulations and neither the 4-armed or the barred galaxy can reproduce the high velocities observed at @xmath8 .",
