    "the source was not known to be in a particularly active state at the time of the observation . during the _ nustar _ observations ,",
    "eight x - ray bursts from the source were detected to our surprise , with one simultaneous detection in the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "the _ nustar _ data were processed with nupipeline 1.3.1 along with caldb version 20131007 using standard filters except for psdcal .",

    "we verified that the exposure increases and that the imaging , timing and spectral analysis results are consistent with those obtained with psdcal = yes .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data were processed with science analysis system ( sas ) 12.0.1 using the standard filtering process .",
    "we then further processed the event files for analysis as described below .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we extracted source events in a circle with radius 60@xmath11 in the time interval @xmath2 for each burst .",
    "backgrounds were extracted from the pre - burst time intervals shown in figure  [ fig : lcall ] ( red hatched regions ) .",
    "the pre - burst spectra include photons up to @xmath315 kev above the background and are well described with a power law plus blackbody or two blackbody models , both having 379 kev flux of @xmath12 .",
    "the luminosity for the assumed two blackbody model is @xmath13 ( see archibald r.  f. 2014 , in prep . for more detail ) .",
    "note that the extraction times are very short , so background contamination is very small ( @xmath14 cps including the persistent source emission ) .",
    "we fit the spectrum to an absorbed blackbody and an absorbed power law using the @xmath15 statistic ( cstat in xspec 12.8.1 ) in the 3@xmath16 kev band , where @xmath16 was between 30 and 50 kev depending on the source flux .",
    "we verified that the fit results did not change over a broad range of the upper energy limit .",
    "there were not many events in each spectrum , and we found that both spectral models provided good fits . since _",
    "nustar _ is not sensitive in the energy band below 3 kev , we were not able to measure @xmath17 , and so we froze it at the value measured previously ( @xmath18 , * ? ? ?",
    "we show the best - fit parameters for the blackbody model in table  [ ta : bursts ] .",
    "note that the numbers of events in @xmath2 for the bursts 2 , 3 , 4 , and 7 were smaller than @xmath310 , and the spectral parameters were not reasonably constrained .",
    "we also tried to fit the data using the usual @xmath19 method with churazov weighting @xcite after grouping the spectra to have at least 5 counts per bin found that the results are consistent with those obtained using the @xmath15 statistic .",
    "although single component models provide good fits , we also tried to fit the spectra to double blackbody models , since magnetars sometimes show double blackbody spectra during bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the second blackbody component is not statistically required for any bursts in our data .",
    "however , it is possible that there was an undetected high - temperature blackbody component as was seen by , e.g. , @xcite",
    ". therefore , we measure a luminosity upper limit for a high - temperature blackbody component .",
    "we first froze the parameters of the single blackbody fit at the values obtained above , added another high - temperature blackbody , and scanned the parameter space of the high - temperature blackbody using the steppar command in xspec .",
    "the luminosity upper limit increased with @xmath20 as expected since _",
    "nustar _ becomes less sensitive as @xmath20 goes up .",
    "we measured the 90% luminosity upper limit to be 0.28@xmath21 for @xmath22 , for example .",
    "we also set an upper limit on flux of a possible lower temperature blackbody , similar to that seen in the bursts of sgr  1900@xmath914 @xcite , where the authors found a low - temperature blackbody component with @xmath20 as low as @xmath32 kev having comparable luminosity with the high temperature component .",
    "we followed the same procedure that we did above for the high - temperature component but with @xmath23 kev , and found that the luminosity upper limits are 210@xmath24 , always an order of magnitude smaller than the bursts luminosities in table  [ ta : bursts ] .",
    "we also characterized the post - burst tail emission for the bursts with a significant tail ( bursts 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 8) . in order to minimize the effect of the burst , we removed the @xmath2 intervals in this analysis .",
    "we extracted events from a circular region of a radius 60@xmath11 centered on the source , and the background from a source - free region on the same detector in a radius 90@xmath11 in the _ nustar _ data .",
    "since the source spectrum may change significantly during a burst , we subdivided each burst into several sub - intervals such that each interval has @xmath3200 counts , in order to have good time resolution and to be statistically sensitive to the change in the spectral parameters in time .",
    "the integration times were very short at early times after a burst , and we could not collect enough background events . therefore ,",
    "for those sub - intervals we used a longer background exposure ( 1  ks ) .",
    "we fit the spectrum for each sub - interval to an absorbed blackbody and an absorbed power - law model using @xmath15 statistic in xspec .",
    "the fit ranges were 3@xmath16 , where @xmath16 was 2050 kev .",
    "both blackbody and power - law models are acceptable , although blackbody models provide better fits in general , giving fit statistics smaller by @xmath310 on average ( @xmath3200 dof ) .",
    "we show the results for the blackbody fit in figure  [ fig : bbradfit]a  c .",
    "note that the persistent emission is included in the spectra in this case .",
    "we then tried to characterize the spectral evolution after removing the persistent emission .",
    "the persistent level was extracted from the source region but in the pre - burst time intervals shown in figure  [ fig : lcall ] .",
    "the source seemed to return to the persistent level @xmath323 ks after a burst , and thus we analyzed only the first @xmath32 ks after a burst .",
    "we find that the spectral parameters and their evolution are similar to those of the spectra with the persistent emission .",
    "this is expected because the burst tails dominate over the persistent emission during the time intervals .",
    "the bursts have very long tails ( @xmath3 ks ) as is often seen in magnetar bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have measured the time scales of the decaying tails by fitting the light curve . however , as we show above ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bbradfit ] ) , the spectrum evolves significantly over a relatively short timescale , and hence the measured light curves obtained using energy - integrated count rates will be different for different telescopes because of differences in the energy responses .",
    "in order to estimate the decay timescales in an instrument - independent way , we directly measure the spectral evolution of the bursts .",
    "we fit the time evolution of the spectral parameters for the tail spectra including the persistent emission with a power - law decay , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the spectral parameter , @xmath27 is the value of the parameter at @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the decay index , and @xmath30 is a positive constant corresponding to the persistent emission .",
    "we show the results in table  [ ta : tail ] .",
    "note that we do not show the results for burst 3 because we were not able to constrain its decay with the given data .",
    "we note that there might be some less significant bursts in the tails .",
    "for example , bursts 2 and 7 occurred at @xmath3600 s and @xmath3200 s into the tail of burst 1 and 6 , respectively . also , there seems to be an increase in @xmath20 and @xmath31 at @xmath3600 s after burst 5 although we did not find any significant burst .",
    "undetected or less significant bursts may bias @xmath29 to a smaller value . also note that we assumed that the luminosity at late times can freely vary in the fit , and the best - fit values for @xmath32 are 0.51.2@xmath33 , sometimes smaller than the pre - burst source luminosity .",
    "if we freeze @xmath32 at the pre - burst value of @xmath34 , @xmath29 becomes 0.91.0 .",
    "+    we also analyzed the _ xmm - newton _ data to characterize precisely the soft - band ( 0.510 kev ) spectrum of the burst 4 tail which is the only burst detected simultaneously with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ nustar_. we extracted source and background events in circles with radius 32@xmath11 for an exposure of @xmath3400 s excluding the @xmath2 interval , where the background region was @xmath3200@xmath11 north of the source .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ count rates were 1.2/1.3 and 4.5 cps for mos1/2 and pn , respectively .",
    "such count rates will result in spectral distortion of @xmath351% and @xmath32.5% for mos1/2 and pn , much smaller than the statistical uncertainties we obtain below .",
    "hence , we used all the mos1/2 and pn data .",
    "we grouped the spectrum to have at least 20 events per spectral bin .",
    "we then extracted _ nustar _",
    "events for the same time interval , and binned the spectrum to have 20 events per bin , and jointly fit the _ xmm - newton _ and the _ nustar _ data with holding @xmath17 fixed at @xmath18 .",
    "note that the persistent emission was not removed in these spectra .",
    "single component models were not acceptable with @xmath19/dof of 583/102 and 122/102 for a blackbody and a power law , respectively .",
    "a double blackbody model was acceptable with @xmath19/dof=127/100 . but a blackbody plus power - law model provided a better fit ( @xmath19/dof=98/100 ) , and adding one more blackbody slightly improved the fit ( @xmath19/dof=96/98 ) although it was required only with low significance ( f - test probability 40% ) .",
    "nevertheless , the parameters for the soft spectral component ( @xmath36 kev and @xmath37 ) of the power law plus two blackbody model were similar to those of the quiescent spectrum of the source @xcite , and the hard component ( @xmath38 kev ) is similar to that of the spectrum with the persistent emission removed ( see below ) .",
    "when we let @xmath17 vary , we obtain similar results as the above with @xmath39 .",
    "we also tried to characterize the persistent - emission - removed spectrum of the combined data . here ,",
    "the persistent level was extracted from the pre - burst time intervals in the source region for both _ nustar _ and",
    "_ xmm - newton_. a blackbody model was able to fit the data well ( @xmath40 kev , @xmath19/dof=96/104 ) but a power - law model was not as good ( @xmath19/dof=128/104 ) .",

    "+ @xmath46 subscript g is used for the gaussian parameters : line energy ( @xmath47 ) , line width ( @xmath48 ) , and normalization ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "+    we searched for the spectral feature at @xmath313 kev previously observed from this source s burst spectra @xcite .",
    "as the feature was observed in the @xmath352 sec spectra in the past , we checked if a line feature was statistically required in the burst spectra ( see section  [ burstspec ] ) but found that it is not .",
    "however , as we increased the integration time , we started seeing an enhancement in counts at @xmath313 kev for burst 5 .    in order to see if a line feature is statistically required for the bursts and their tail emission , we first extracted a spectrum from the first 150  s of the brightest burst ( burst 5 ) .",
    "the background was extracted from the pre - burst interval in the source region .",
    "we then fit the spectrum in the 330 kev band with continuum models ( blackbody , power law , and bremsstrahlung ) , and found that none could describe the data well with @xmath19/dof of 70/42 ( blackbody ) , 108/42 ( power law ) , and 147/42 ( bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "we also tried combinations of the continuum models , but none improve the fit significantly with @xmath19/dof being 67/40 , 108/40 , 67/40 , 67/40 for a double blackbody , a double power - law , a blackbody plus power - law , and a blackbody plus bremsstrahlung models , respectively . in particular , in all these two - component trials , the best - fit parameters of the second component are trivial ; the amplitude is not constrained at all , and @xmath20 or @xmath50 become ridiculously small or large . however , adding a gaussian line to a blackbody model provided an acceptable fit ( @xmath19/dof = 38/40 ) .",
    "we show the spectrum and the blackbody plus gaussian fit in figure  [ fig : feature ] , and the results are presented in table  [ ta : spec ] .",
    "we repeated the same procedure for spectra in different time intervals ( e.g. , 100  s , 200  s , and 300  s ) , and found that the fit improves significantly ( @xmath51@xmath52 ) by adding a gaussian line to the blackbody model , from which we draw the same conclusion as we did with the 150-s spectrum .",
    "we conducted the same analysis with the other bursts and found that a blackbody model alone was able to describe their spectra well ( for example , @xmath19/dof=39/35 , @xmath53 for burst 6 ) .",
    "we used simulations in order to calculate the true significance of the feature in burst 5 and its tail .",
    "the spectrum of the source following a burst evolved on a time scale of 150-s .",
    "therefore , we conducted simulations with temporally evolving blackbody spectra .",
    "we first divided the 150-s spectrum of burst 5 into five time intervals as shown in figure  [ fig : bbradfit ] and the @xmath2 interval , and fit the six spectra to blackbody models after removing the energy range of the feature ( 11.514 kev ) .",
    "we then simulated the six spectra using fakeit in xspec with the response and background for the actual data , and merged them into one spectrum that represents a 150-s spectrum .",
    "for each simulation , we first fit the spectrum to a blackbody , and then calculated the improvement of the fit ( @xmath51 ) by adding a gaussian line .",
    "for the latter fit , we scanned the energy range of the spectrum ( 422 kev ) with a step of 1 kev for the initial value of the line energy because the narrow feature can make the fit fall in a local minimum around the initial value .",
    "we counted the number of occurrences in which the improvement of the fit in a simulation was larger than that seen in the actual data fit ( @xmath54 ) , and found that this did not occur in 10,000 simulations .",
    "the significance of the feature would be even higher if we scan only a smaller energy range ( e.g. , 1115 kev ) for the gaussian line energy guided by the previous _ rxte _ measurements .",
    "we found that a blackbody model fits the spectra of the feature - removed 150-s data as well as the above simulations .",
    "therefore , we also conducted simulations with a single blackbody continuum model , and found that improvement of fit measured by @xmath51 by adding a gaussian line model was always smaller than 31 in 10,000 simulations .",
    "we investigated if the feature exists in the spectra without the burst .",
    "we removed the @xmath2 interval from burst 5 and extracted tail spectra for 100 s , 150 s , 200 s , and 300 s exposures .",
    "we then applied the same fitting procedure and found that the same conclusion is valid ; for example , single or combinations of continuum models do not fit the 150-s spectrum well with @xmath19/dof of 75/39 ( blackbody ) , and 164/39 ( power law ) while adding a gaussian line to a blackbody improves the fit significantly , making it acceptable ( @xmath19/dof = 42/36 ) .",
    "the best - fit gaussian line parameters are statistically consistent with those we obtained above .",
    "we checked if the spectral feature shifts in energy with phase as seen in the magnetar sgr  0418@xmath95729 @xcite . we produced a 2-d energy versus phase image as shown in @xcite , and found no evidence of a shift .",
    "this may be due to the paucity of counts in our case .",
    "we also tried to see if the feature is more prominent in some phase intervals than the others , and could not draw any statistically significant conclusion .",
    "we have reported the first detection of x - ray bursts from magnetar 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 with a focusing hard x - ray telescope .",
    "table  [ ta : bursts ] summarizes the temporal and spectral properties of the eight bursts detected with _",
    "nustar_. the short timescale behaviors of the bursts are different from burst to burst , having @xmath55 and @xmath56 of milliseconds to seconds .",
    "all the bursts have relatively long tails ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bbradfit ] ) and their spectra evolve with time .",
    "we also found that their peak times are random in phase .",
    "magnetar bursts , including those we have observed for 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , generally exhibit a fast rise and fall , which has been suggested to result from crustal fracture @xcite and/or magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "the pulse phase of the burst peak was previously used to reconstruct the event location and constrain the emission geometry @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the bursts appear to occur at random pulse phases ( table  [ ta : bursts ] ) , and bursts 2 and 5 may be emitted far from the magnetic axis of the star . note , however , that the location reconstruction assumes emission beaming along the magnetic field lines , which may not be realistic .",
    "a quasi - isotropic burst could be visible from any direction unless it is eclipsed by the neutron star .",
    "the probability of eclipse is significantly reduced by gravitational light bending , which makes @xmath57 of the star visible to a distant observer @xcite .",
    "a burst can have tail emission which is produced by the residual heat of the crustal fracturing @xcite or bombardment of the stellar surface by the magnetospheric particles @xcite .",
    "the tail emission lasts much longer than a burst , and allows us to sample many full rotations .",
    "studying pulse profiles during burst tails may provide insight into the tail emission region .",
    "interestingly , we find clear phase shifts in some post - burst profiles ( e.g. , bursts 4 and 5 , see figs .",
    "[ fig : residual ] and [ fig : profiles ] ) , which are not caused by rotation ( section  [ timingana ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the source of tail emission , e.g. the hot spot produced by the burst , is slightly shifted in longitude relative to the source of persistent emission .",
    "the pulse profiles measured by xmm - newton ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xmmprofiles ] ) also hint at the appearance of a new hot spot .",
    "the immediate post - burst pulse profile shows an additional peak at phase @xmath30.3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xmmprofiles]b ) , which may corresponds to the new hot spot .",
    "its emission added to the pulsed persistent source results in a phase shift , which returns to zero as the luminosity of the new hot spot decays and the persistent source dominates again ( fig .",
    "[ fig : residual ] ) .",
    "interesting correlations between burst spectral properties have been seen in some magnetars .",
    "for example , @xcite reported an anti - correlation between fluence and hardness ratio in the bursts of sgr  1806@xmath020 and sgr  1900@xmath914 ; however , @xcite observed the opposite trend between the same properties in the bursts of 1e  2259@xmath9589 .",
    "while detailed studies of such correlations here are not possible due to the limited number of bursts and small statistics in each burst , we note that there seems to be a hint of a positive correlation between @xmath58 and @xmath20 ( see table  [ ta : bursts ] ) .",
    "the source flux returns to the pre - burst value on the kilo - second timescale .",
    "such a short timescale suggests that the crustal heating was not deep , as the large specific heat of the deep crust would hold the energy longer and delay the decay @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of tail emission at @xmath3101000 s can be fitted by a blackbody or a power - law model ; the blackbody model provides a better fit when the persistent emission is subtracted .",
    "the evolution of the blackbody luminosity @xmath31 can be described as a power law with the decay index of 0.80.9 ( table  [ ta : tail ] ) .",
    "is subtracted ; besides the measured decay index might be affected by undetected low - significance bursts during the tail emission . ]",

    "we note that the line flux we measured is only @xmath310% of that previously reported @xcite , which could be simply due to the long integration time we used ( 150-s versus 1-s ) .    if we interpret the line - like emission as an electron cyclotron feature , the line energy implies that the magnetic field strength is @xmath310@xmath65 in the emission region .",
    "a magnetic field strength of @xmath32@xmath66 could be inferred if we interpret the feature due to a proton cyclotron emission , and the line width implies a @xmath310% change in the magnetic field strength in the emission region .",
    "the three detections of the feature from 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and this work ) have similar properties ( e.g. , line energy and width ) , and probably originated from the same region of the star .",
    "if so , it is unlikely that a physical structure can be sustaining at a height of @xmath370 km from the stellar surface ( where @xmath67@xmath3@xmath68 ) to power bursts and line features multiple times over a decade .",
    "however , a strong multipolar magnetic field ( @xmath69 ) near the surface in a volume of @xmath31 km@xmath70 has enough energy to power multiple bursts and the line feature , suggesting that the line feature could be from proton cyclotron emission .",
    "nevertheless , an interesting question is how different sources which may have different magnetic fields ( 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , xte  j1810@xmath0197 , and 4u  0142@xmath961 ) with different spectral and temporal properties show similar features at such similar energies .",
    "we presented detailed spectral and temporal analyses of eight x - ray bursts from magnetar 1e 1048.1@xmath05937 detected with _ nustar _",
    ", one of which was simultaneously observed with _",
    "xmm - newton_. the bursts exhibited a fast rise and decay with @xmath2 intervals of 14 s , and their spectra can be described with single blackbody models having @xmath1 68  kev for the @xmath2 intervals .",
    "all the bursts showed tail emission which can be described with temporally relaxing blackbody models .",
    "the flux relaxations of the tail emission followed a power - law decay having decay indices 0.80.9 .",
    "we confirm the existence of an emission feature at @xmath313 kev observed in burst and tail spectra of the source in the past .",
    "finally , we note that similar spectral features at a similar energy have been seen in bursts of several magnetars with different spectral and temporal properties .",
    "this requires further theoretical interpretations .",

    "<S> we report the detection of eight bright x - ray bursts from the 6.5-s magnetar 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 , during a 2013 july observation campaign with _ the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar)_. we study the morphological and spectral properties of these bursts and their evolution with time . </S>",
    "<S> the bursts resulted in count rate increases by orders of magnitude , sometimes limited by the detector dead time , and showed blackbody spectra with @xmath1 68 kev in the @xmath2 duration of 14 s , similar to earlier bursts detected from the source . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spectra during the tail of the bursts can be modeled with an absorbed blackbody with temperature decreasing with flux . </S>",
    "<S> the bursts flux decays followed a power - law of index  0.80.9 . in the burst tail spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we detect a @xmath313 kev emission feature , similar to those reported in previous bursts from this source as well as from other magnetars observed with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte)_. we explore possible origins of the spectral feature such as proton cyclotron emission , which implies a magnetic field strength of @xmath4 in the emission region . </S>",
