    "it is possible to provide detailed analytic estimates of the difference between the geodesic ( deviation ) equation and the generalized jacobi equation using the solutions of these equations of relative motion presented in secs .",

    "motion with speed below @xmath320 , tidal effects tend to behave more or less as one would generally expect on the basis of newtonian gravitation theory . that ultrarelativistic gravitational tidal effects could exhibit astrophysically interesting features that would be contrary to newtonian expectations was first pointed out in ref .",

    "the purpose of this appendix is to bring out the difficulties encountered in attempts to employ _ explicit _ fermi coordinates in black - hole spacetimes . to this end , we imagine in the following treatment the simplest situation of astrophysical interest , namely , purely radial motion in the exterior schwarzschild gravitational field .",
    "consider the exterior schwarzschild spacetime of a spherical source of mass @xmath242 represented by the metric @xmath326 for @xmath327 . to simplify matters",

    ", we must specify a reference observer .",
    "imagine , therefore , a free observer @xmath329 that starts from @xmath330 at @xmath331 and follows an escape trajectory that reaches radial infinity with zero speed .",
    "the geodesic equations of motion for this observer are @xmath332 where @xmath7 is the observer s proper time such that @xmath333 at @xmath331 and @xmath334 .",
    "the system   can be integrated and the result is @xmath335 where @xmath336 and @xmath337 are constants of integration and can be expressed in terms of @xmath338 using the initial conditions .",
    "the observer carries an orthonormal parallel - propagated tetrad @xmath65 along its path .",
    "this local frame is given by unit vectors along the temporal and radial directions @xmath339 in @xmath340 coordinates , respectively , as well as @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "the axial symmetry of the spacetime about the @xmath168 axis implies that a rotational degeneracy exists in the choice of @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "but , once these unit vectors are chosen at @xmath331 , they are then parallel transported along the path of @xmath1 .",

    "they are given by @xmath343 where @xmath344 is an integration constant and @xmath345 .",

    "makes it evident that it is not possible to express @xmath352 _ explicitly _ in terms of @xmath120 and @xmath44 .",
    "it follows that the radial coordinate @xmath360 in the schwarzschild metric   can not be expressed explicitly in terms of @xmath120 and @xmath44 . for the explicit expression of the metric in fermi",
    "coordinates , one must resort to expansions in powers of @xmath44 .",
    "it is therefore clear that the transformation @xmath361 is given only _",

    "we find that @xmath362 where @xmath363 using transformations   , we find the relevant metric coefficients in fermi coordinates @xmath364 in agreement with eqs .   , since in this case @xmath365    we have shown that it is not possible to provide explicit fermi coordinates for radial motion in the exterior schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the upshot of our direct approach is just a different approximation scheme for determining the series of tidal terms in eqs .  . in this way , we have also provided the justification for using the generalized jacobi equation in our previous work  @xcite .",

    "the purpose of this appendix is to describe a general method for determining the timescale over which the first - order approximation is valid .",
