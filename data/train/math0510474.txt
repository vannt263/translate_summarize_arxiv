    "gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) , existence of travelling waves , pulsating travelling waves and travelling breathers represents a challenging problem of applied mathematics ( see recent reviews in @xcite ) .",
    "our work deals with the travelling kinks between the non - zero equilibrium states @xmath28 .",
    "we are not interested in the travelling breathers and pulsating waves near the zero equilibrium state since the zero state is linearly unstable in the dynamics of the discrete klein  gordon lattice ( [ klein - gordon ] ) with @xmath29 . indeed , looking for solutions in the form @xmath30",
    ", we derive the dispersion relation for linear waves near the zero equilibrium state : @xmath31 it follows from the dispersion relation that there exists @xmath32 such that @xmath33 for @xmath34 . on the other hand , the non - zero equilibrium states @xmath35 and @xmath36 are neutrally stable in the dynamics of the discrete klein  gordon lattice ( [ klein - gordon ] ) with @xmath37 .",
    "we focus hence on bounded heteroclinic orbits which connect the stable non - zero equilibrium states @xmath36 and @xmath35 in the form : @xmath38 where the function @xmath39 solves the differential advance - delay equation : @xmath40 we consider the following class of solutions of the differential advance - delay equation ( [ advance - delay ] ) : ( i ) @xmath39 is twice continuously differentiable function on @xmath41 ; ( ii ) @xmath39 is monotonically increasing on @xmath41 and ( iii ) @xmath39 satisfies boundary conditions : @xmath42    it is easy to verify that the continuous klein  gordon equation ( [ kg ] ) with @xmath13 in ( [ nonlinearity - kink ] ) yields a travelling kink solution in the form @xmath43 , @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "however , the travelling kink can be destroyed in the discrete klein  gordon lattice ( [ klein - gordon ] ) , which results in violation of one or more conditions on @xmath39 . for instance , the bounded twice continuously differentiable solution @xmath39 may develop non - vanishing oscillatory tails around the equilibrium states @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "a recent progress on travelling kinks was reported for the discrete @xmath0 model .",
    "four particular spatial discretizations of the nonlinearity @xmath46 were proposed with four independent and alternative methods @xcite , where the ultimate goal was to construct a family of translation - invariant stationary kinks for @xmath47 , that are given by continuous , monotonically increasing functions @xmath39 on @xmath41 with the boundary conditions ( [ kink - bc ] ) .",
    "exceptional discretizations were generalized in @xcite , where multi - parameter families of cubic polynomials @xmath6 were obtained .",
    "it was observed in numerical simulations of the discrete @xmath0 model @xcite that the effective translational invariance of stationary kinks implies reduction of radiation diverging from moving kinks .",
    "new effects such as self - acceleration were reported for some of the exceptional discretizations in @xcite . nevertheless , from a mathematically strict point of view , we shall ask if exceptional discretizations guarantee existence of true travelling kinks ( heteroclinic orbits ) at least for small values of @xmath48 .",
    "the question was answered negatively in @xcite , where numerical analysis of beyond - all - order expansions was developed .",
    "it was shown that bifurcations of travelling kink solutions from @xmath49 to small non - zero @xmath5 do not generally occur in the discrete @xmath0 model with small values of @xmath48 , even if the exceptional discretizations allow these bifurcations for @xmath47 .",
    "it was also discovered in @xcite that bifurcations of travelling kink solutions may occur for finitely many isolated values of @xmath48 far from the limit @xmath50 .",
    "the discrete sine - gordon model was also subject of recent studies .",
    "numerical computations were used to identify oscillatory tails of small amplitudes on the travelling kink solutions @xcite .",
    "these tails were explained with analysis of central manifold reductions ( carried out without the normal form reductions ) @xcite .",
    "exceptional discretizations of the nonlinearity @xmath51 were suggested by the topological bound method in @xcite ( see the review in @xcite ) and by the `` inverse '' ( direct substitution ) method in @xcite .",
    "simultaneously with the absence of single kinks in the sine - gordon lattices , multiple kinks ( between non - zero equilibrium points of @xmath52 ) were discovered with the formal reduction of the discrete lattice ( [ klein - gordon ] ) to the fourth - order ode problem in @xcite and confirmed with numerical analysis of the differential advanced - delay equation in @xcite .",
    "our work is motivated by the recent advances in studies of differential advanced - delay equations from the point of dynamical system methods such as central manifold reductions and normal forms ( see pioneer works in @xcite ) .",
    "the same methods were recently applied in @xcite to travelling solitary waves in discrete nonlinear schrdinger lattices near the maximum group velocity of linear waves .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that non - existence of travelling solitary waves can be derived already in the truncated ( polynomial ) normal form .",

    "this particular point corresponds to the quadruple zero eigenvalue on the central manifold of the dynamical system .",
    "a general reversible normal form for the quadruple zero eigenvalue was derived and studied in @xcite ( see also tutorials in the book @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the discrete klein  gordon lattice was considered in @xcite but the nonlinearity @xmath13 was taken to be decreasing near @xmath54 , such that the quadruple zero eigenvalue was not observed in the list of possible bifurcations of travelling wave solutions ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) . on the other hand , the quadruple zero eigenvalue occurred in the discrete fermi  pasta ",

    "rigorous persistence analysis of bounded solutions ( heteroclinic orbits between periodic solutions near @xmath36 and @xmath35 ) is developed with the technique of center manifold reduction .",
    "our main conclusion is that the differential advance - delay equation ( [ advance - delay ] ) has no monotonic travelling kinks near the point @xmath53 and @xmath49 but it admits families of non - monotonic travelling kinks with oscillatory tails .",
    "it seems surprising that the truncated normal form is independent on the discretizations of the nonlinearity function @xmath6 and the negative result extends to all exceptional discretizations constructed in @xcite .",
    "any one - parameter curves of the monotonic travelling kinks , which bifurcate on the plane @xmath55 from the finite set of isolated points @xmath56 ( see numerical results in @xcite ) , may only exist far from the point @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , we shall explain bifurcations of multiple kinks from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , @xmath60 in the discrete sine - gordon equation from the point of normal form analysis .",
    "these bifurcations may occur along an infinite set of curves on the plane @xmath55 which all intersect the point @xmath57 ( see numerical results in @xcite ) .",
    "we shall also derive the truncated normal form from the discretizations of the inverse method reported in @xcite and show that it may admit special solutions for monotonic kinks , when the continuity condition ( [ nonlinearity - continuous ] ) is violated .",
    "we emphasize that our methods are very different from the computations of beyond - all - order expansions , exploited in the context of difference maps in @xcite and differential advanced - delay equations in @xcite . by working near the particular point @xmath53 and @xmath49",
    ", we avoid beyond - all - order expansions and derive non - existence results at the polynomial normal form . in an asymptotic limit of common validity , bifurcations of heteroclinic orbits in the truncated normal form can be studied with beyond - all - order computations ( see recent analysis and review in @xcite ) .",
