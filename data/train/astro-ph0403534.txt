    ".    recently found accelerated expansion of our universe @xcite is explained in the literature by the presence of the @xmath0-term or the so - called quintessence matter satisfying the equation of state with negative pressure @xcite .",
    "observation of type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) revealed that this form of energy called dark energy could dominate the present evolution of the universe .",
    "therefore it is important to consider different candidates for dark energy . in the paper of stelmach and jakacka",
    "it was shown that non - homogeneity in spherically symmetric stephani model can be treated as some kind of dark energy due to which the universe accelerates ( we call this model `` s - j model '' ) .",
    "it is a sort of fictitious fluid for which density parameter @xmath3 can be defined",
    ". then dynamics can be formally reduced to the frw flat model with additional fluid satisfying the equation of state @xmath4 corresponding to the equation of state for topological defects in a form of domain walls @xcite .",
    "the best fitting procedure applied to supernovae data as well as confidence level for the redshift - magnitude relation shows that @xmath3 should dynamically dominate the present evolution of the universe if we want to explain observational data without cosmological term ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "stephani model in the s - j version can be described by the generalized friedman equation @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an effective curvature index which depends on time .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants ( @xmath9 ) . in the above equation non - homogeneity",
    "is not explicitly present .",
    "this is due to the choice of the time parameter .    equation ( 1 ) is de facto a first integral of the einstein equation which is a second order equation for the scale factor .",
    "it is obtained by assuming that the observer is placed at a symmetry center @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the universe in the neighbourhood of this center .",
    "the relation @xmath11 is a special form of a more generalized ansatz of a type @xmath12 however , @xmath13 is a simplest case , and our goal is to show that such exotic model can explain sn ia data of perlmutter even in this simple case .    for further purposes it is convenient to write down eq .",

    "our non - homogeneous stephani model looks formally as a flat friedman model with two noninteracting components .",
    "because of interpretation of the s - j model in terms of frw model with additional fictious fluid we can simply find hamiltonian formalism for dynamics of the system .",
    "a first integral of the friedman equation can always be used for reduction of the motion of the system to a motion of a particle of unit mass in one dimensional potential @xcite .",
    "if we define @xmath27 then the potential is @xmath28 and the euler - lagrange equation of motion reads @xmath29 and has a newton - like form .",
    "the hamiltonian in the considered case has the form : @xmath30 where we defined @xmath31    trajectories of the system lie on a zero energy level @xmath32 and a hamiltonian constraint must coincide with the form of the first integral of the equation of motion ( 10 ) .",
    "the advantage of having the hamiltonian function given by eq ( 11 ) is that one is then able to make easily full classification of solutions in the configuration space @xcite .",
    "moreover dynamics can be presented in two dimensional phase plane .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion describe a simple dynamical system consisting of a particle moving in one dimensional potential : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is given by ( 9 ) , and @xmath38 is its first integral",
    ". qualitative analysis of differential equation implies a shift from finding and analysing individual solution to investigating the space of all solutions .",
    "certain properties ( such as existence or absence of horizons , existence of singularities ) are believed to be realistic if they can be attributed to a larger class of models within the space off all solutions ( phase space ) .",
    "this approach offers a possibility of investigating the space of all possible solutions for the considered problem .",
    "of course the system ( 12 ) possesses the first integral @xmath39 which defines a family of algebraic curves ( phase curves ) on which the trajectories of the system lie .",

    "the system is described by the equations @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the first integral is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and we put @xmath46 .",
    "the phase domain is @xmath47 .",
    "the acceleration region is situated to the right of the saddle point , therefore for the lematre - eddington ( loitering ) universes the acceleration begins in the middle of a quasi - static stage .    for comparison the frw model with dust and cosmological constant",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "3 . we can observe how non - homogeneity term can mimic cosmological constant term . in the particular cases we have : a ) @xmath48 , b ) @xmath49 , where @xmath50 c ) @xmath51 , where @xmath52 with @xmath53        the phase portrait is organized by critical points ( @xmath54 ) ( i.e singular solution for which @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) and joining them trajectories .",
    "hence the phase portrait provides a global qualitative picture for the dynamics .",
    "two phase portraits are equivalent if there exists an orientation preserving homeomorphism mapping integral curves of the systems . in our case",
    "the critical point for @xmath57 is representing by static universe .",
    "then @xmath58 where @xmath59 while constructing the phase portrait it is important for the system to be linearized near the critical points because the hartman - grobman theorem says that the original system is equivalent to its linear part in the nearby hyperbolic critical points ( a critical point is hyperbolic ( non - degenerate ) ) if there exists such @xmath60 that @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are eigenvalues of a linearization matrix . a character of critical points",
    "is determined by characteristic equation for the linearization matrix @xmath63 since in our case @xmath64 only saddle points ( @xmath65 ) or centres ( @xmath66 ) are admissible .",
    "after some simple calculations one can check that a type of the critical point depends on the diagram of the potential , namely : @xmath67 therefore for @xmath68 there exists only one critical point which is of saddle type , i.e it is a structurally stable point .",
    "the full knowledge of the dynamical system comprises also its behaviour at infinity . to achieve",
    "this one usually transforms the phase space into a poincar sphere .",
    "then infinitely distant points of the phase plane are mapped onto the sphere s equator .",
    "the phase trajectories are mapped into corresponding curves on @xmath69 .",
    "the character of critical points is preserved and new critical points representing asymptotic states of the system can appear at the equator .",
    "then an orthogonal projection of any hemisphere onto a tangent plane compactifies phase portrait .",
    "due to existence of the first integral in such a system we can discuss some interesting properties of the evolutional path .",
    "there is a theorem @xcite about nonexistence of particle horizon in such a model , namely if @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a constant , then there is no particle horizon in the past . in terms of potentials ,",
    "if @xmath73 for @xmath74 then there exists no particle horizon .",
    "it follows from the implication @xmath75 we can see from fig . 1 and fig . 2 in the s - j paper that all models with exception of case a ) do not possess particle horizons .",
    "this is equivalent to nonexistence of the horizon problem in the corresponding models .",
    "however , it does not necessarily mean that if the condition @xmath76 for @xmath74 is not satisfied then the horizon problem appears .",
    "in that case explicit evaluation of the integrals is required .",
    "we shall not deal with the problem in the present paper .",
    "as regards a flatness problem it does not appear in a cosmological model if for later times the curvature term does not dominate the matter term . in our model for the the problem not to appear",
    "we need the following condition to be satisfied @xmath77 hence @xmath78 of course this is not the case considered either in the s - j or in the present paper , hence the flatness problem must be solved in a similar way as in the standard cosmology ( e.g. using inflationary scenario ) .",
    "the case @xmath79 is particularly interesting because the corresponding cosmological model without matter ( @xmath80 ) evolves with constant acceleration . with matter",
    "it accelerates always for later times independently of @xmath8 .",
    "it follows from the relation @xmath81 let us now differentiate both sides of the eq .",
    "( 4 ) with respect to @xmath82 @xmath83 if we want the model to accelerate at the present epoch we must put @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "hence we get the expected result @xmath86 since this is the nonhomogeneity , which drives the acceleration .",
    "it is well known that luminosity of observed objects , depends sensitively on the spatial geometry ( curvature ) and dynamics of the universe .",
    "therefore a cosmic distance measure , e.g. luminosity distance , depends on the present densities of different components filling up the universe and their equations of state . for this reason ,",
    "the magnitude - redshift relation is proposed as a potential test for cosmological models and play important role in determining cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "let us consider an observer located at @xmath87 and at the moment @xmath88 receiving light emitted at @xmath89 from the source of absolute luminosity @xmath90 located at the radial distance @xmath91 .",
    "cosmological redshift @xmath92 of the source is related to @xmath89 and @xmath93 by the formula @xmath94 where the function @xmath95 is @xmath96 if the apparent luminosity of the source measured by the observer is @xmath97 , then the luminosity distance @xmath98 of the source , defined @xmath99 is given by : @xmath100 for historical reasons , the observed and absolute luminosities are defined respectively in terms of @xmath101-corrected observed and absolute magnitudes @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) @xcite .",

    "similarly as in the paper of jakacka and stelmach we consider physically the simplest case , i.e. we assume that in the neighbourhood of the symmetry center the matter filling up the universe is a dust , hence @xmath40 .",
    "we define @xmath116 . in this case",

    "we assume that supernovae measurements come with uncorrelated gaussian errors and in this case the likelihood functions @xmath128 can be determined from chi - squared statistics @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "in the paper of stelmach and jakacka it was shown that spherically symmetric stephani cosmological model satisfying natural assumptions concerning local equation of state for the matter may explain supernovae data of perlmutter in the context of the magnitude - redshift relation . in the present paper",
    "we discuss this problem in more detail and we find numerical values of these parameters such that observational data are best fitted to our theoretical @xmath130 curve .",

    "separately we analyse the sample of 54 supernovae ( perlmutter sample c ) , where 4 outliers and 2 reddened supernovae were excluded , finding no significant differences . in fig .  4 we present plots of magnitude - redshift relations for the stephani model and the perlmutter sample a.
