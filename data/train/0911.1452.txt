    "in the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics the wave function is the solution of the schrdinger equation and plays the role of a mathematical tool in calculating the probability for finding the particle in a given volume of space . in this framework",
    "the normalization constant of the wave function is determined by the condition @xmath1 on the contrary , de broglie interpreted this wave @xmath2 as a genuine field guiding the particle in spacetime . in 1924",
    "he proposed@xcite the relation @xmath3 between the classical conserved momentum @xmath4 of a free particle and the wave number @xmath5 of the associated plane wave .",
    "of course the normalization of four velocity @xmath6 implies @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the rest mass of the particle and @xmath9 for a particle moving along the x - axis with a constant velocity @xmath10 .",
    "generalizing this concept , in 1927 , de broglie formulated `` the theory of the double solution''@xcite in which the particles are accompanied in spacetime by a _ real _",
    "`` pilot wave '' @xmath11 = r(t , x , y , z)exp \\left [ \\frac{i}{\\hbar } p_\\mu x^\\mu\\right ] \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] in such a way that the guiding formula : @xmath12 holds . then this idea was improved in 1952 by bohm s hidden variable theory@xcite and by vigier and his co - workers in the stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics@xcite that is now an alternative to the standard point of view . following this line of thinking ,",
    "if we want to believe in the reality of de broglie waves , we must give an answer to bell s famous question : `` what is it that @xmath13 in wave mechanics ? ''",
    "@xcite specifying which genuine field is responsible for the de broglie wave and simultaneously determining the amplitude @xmath14 of these waves somehow .",
    "we stress that in the whole paper we use the word `` amplitude '' in the framework of classical physics as `` the half of a total oscillation between a maximum and a minimum of the wave '' and not with the meaning of `` probability amplitude '' related in quantum mechanics to inner products between state vectors .",
    "the hope is that one can find an amplitude that will vanish in the limit @xmath15 and will be very small for macroscopic bodies with a large mass and extension .",
    "a recent proposal consists in considering the de broglie waves of one - particle quantum mechanics as a special kind of gravitational waves .",
    "a solution of the linearized einstein equations found in 1998 by feoli and scarpetta@xcite has in fact the right features to be interpreted as the wave associated to a quantum particle because the guiding formula is satisfied .",
    "a similar solution and interpretation was also found in 2005 by chang@xcite for a special kind of electromagnetic waves .",
    "starting from a metric tensor @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 ) and neglecting any terms of order @xmath18 , the linearized einstein field equations in vacuo are @xmath19 if the de donder - lanczos conditions @xmath20 are satisfied .",
    "the classical solution is a plane wave with @xmath21 . on the contrary , we found@xcite a solution in the form of a wave packet of cylindrical symmetry around the propagation direction : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary constant that in this paper we want to calculate",
    ", @xmath24 is the bessel function of the 0th - order , @xmath25 is the polarization tensor and @xmath26 , the constant wave number , is such that @xmath27 , corresponding to a gravitational wave propagating along the @xmath28 - axis with a phase velocity @xmath29 .",
    "if we put @xmath30 , this solution can be interpreted as the de broglie wave associated with a particle of rest mass @xmath8 moving with constant velocity @xmath10 along the @xmath28 - axis because the phase has the right behavior @xmath31 . as in the standard quantum mechanics ,",
    "we can add waves with slightly different velocities around a central value @xmath32 to obtain@xcite a de broglie wave packet with a group velocity @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .",
    "from ( 5 ) we obtained two relations among the nonvanishing components of the polarization tensor that turn out to be depending on the wave number : @xmath35 @xmath36    an interesting limit case is when @xmath37 , i.e. when we have an oscillation in time but not a propagation of the wave and we are in the rest frame of the associated particle . in that case",
    "we found @xmath38 ( hence @xmath39 is proportional to @xmath40 , that is to the velocity of the associated particle @xmath10 ) and @xmath41 .",
    "as in this limit , the only difference among the diagonal components of the constant polarization tensor is the sign , we can write @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a constant to be determined .",
    "but , without changing the solution ( 6 ) , we can also put @xmath44 and redefine @xmath23 as @xmath45 .",
    "in this way we have at least fixed the magnitude of the diagonal components of @xmath25 in the rest frame of the associated particle .",
    "the properties of the de broglie gravitational waves were studied in a series of interesting papers@xcite , but the normalization constant @xmath23 of these waves has always been left undetermined . in this letter",
    "we propose a way to calculate this constant using the standard methods of einstein general relativity ( section 2 ) .",
    "once the amplitude is completely known , a test to verify the existence of this kind of gravitational waves becomes possible .",
    "when the wave meets a sphere of test particles , one can hope to measure not only the magnitude of the shift but also its direction .",
    "to this aim we will calculate ( section 3 ) a very special shift angle that remains constant in time .",
    "following misner , thorne and wheeler@xcite , given the linearized field equations ( 4 ) and assuming the gauge conditions ( 5 ) , we can calculate what they call `` the effective smeared  out stress  energy of gravitational waves '' , starting from an energy - momentum tensor in the form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes an average over several periods in time and wavelengths in space .",
    "this tensor@xcitecontributes to the large  scale background curvature ( which linearized theory ignores ) just as any other stress  energy does : @xmath48 in our simple case there are no `` other fields '' and no other `` matter '' except the particle source of our gravitational field ( 6 ) already included in the @xmath49 .",
    "if this particle , associated with the de broglie wave , is placed in a small volume @xmath50 around @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 , the tensor @xmath49 must coincide in the limit @xmath53 with @xmath54 so the einstein equations including terms of the order @xmath55 can be written : @xmath56 this really happens constructing our energy ",
    "momentum tensor from the gravitational field ( 6 )",
    ". actually , if we write the solution ( 6 ) , that ( fixing @xmath30 ) represents our de broglie wave , in the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 \\eqno(13)\\ ] ] and @xmath59 is given by the equation ( 2 ) , we obtain from ( 9 ) the nonvanishing components of the tensor @xmath60 that are the following : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 in the limit @xmath67 we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 so this tensor reduces to the desired form @xmath70 where @xmath71 that can be interpreted as the energy density of a dust  like source of our gravitational field .    in the rest frame of the particle @xmath72 and , as discussed in the previous section , @xmath44 hence @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath50 is the proper volume of the particle .",
    "finally we find : @xmath75 and , fixing @xmath76 , we obtain : @xmath77 from @xmath78 we have that our model works if @xmath79 for example , for an electron the dust - like approximation of the energy - momentum tensor works if @xmath80 and the linear approximation of einstein equations does if @xmath81 .",
    "of course the two relations are satisfied both using the `` classical radius '' of the electron @xmath82 , and with the lower experimental value @xmath83 proposed by dehmelt@xcite . in this last case the constant ( 24 ) would become @xmath84 ( more precisely the dehmelt value computed from @xmath85 is @xmath86 and the corresponding constant becomes @xmath87 ) and it would be more convenient to measure its effects rather than the ones produced by the standard gravitational waves .",
    "note that , in general , due to the cylindrical symmetry of the solution ( 12 ) , the constraint @xmath88 can be a little bit relaxed . in order to obtain the dust - like tensor , it is enough that the transverse radius of the source @xmath89 , while the length @xmath90 in the @xmath28-direction of the cylindrical tube can be such that @xmath91 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath92 and our particle becomes similar to a string .",
    "furthermore we stress that the constant @xmath23 , that in the rest frame fixes the magnitude of the amplitude @xmath93 , has just the right expected behavior because it vanishes in the limit @xmath15 and is negligible when @xmath8 and @xmath50 are very large . in the standard quantum mechanics a fixed scale parameter is missing ,",
    "so the border between classical bodies and quantum particles is not clear . in our approach ,",
    "the result ( 24 ) allows at least to say that the linear approximation works when ( 25 ) holds and the quantum effects disappear just when @xmath15 or when the product @xmath94 is very large compared to a fixed parameter : @xmath95 that specifies the realm of quantum physics .",
    "in order to propose an experimental test we must refer to the tidal acceleration of geodesic deviation between two particles that does not depend on the particular gauge chosen . considering a central particle @xmath96 in the origin of the reference frame , we could estimate the shift of any peripheral particle at distance @xmath97 from the origin .",
    "when the de broglie gravitational wave passes , moving along the x - axis , it deforms what was a sphere of radius @xmath98 of test particles , as measured in the proper frame of the central particle .",
    "we will calculate explicitly only the shift of the three particles placed on the three axes at the position @xmath98 and the opposite will occur for the three particles at @xmath99 . in some previous papers@xcite we have already calculated the tidal acceleration between two test particles using the relation : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the proper time along the worldline of the two masses , @xmath102 is their four - velocity and @xmath103 their relative distance , while the velocity of the source is @xmath104 in ( 2 ) .",
    "we can use two approximations : the velocity of the test particles is very small compared with the speed of light so @xmath105 and the relative displacement @xmath106 between two of these masses caused by the wave is very small .",
    "so , if the initial position of the first particle @xmath96 is at the origin and of the second one at @xmath107 , we have @xmath108 and we can consider @xmath109 . in this framework",
    "the acceleration of geodesic deviation is @xmath110 where a dot indicates a differentiation with respect to time @xmath111 and @xmath112 . starting from ( 6 ) we calculate :    \\a ) the relative distance between the mass @xmath96 at the origin and the mass @xmath113 initially at @xmath114 @xmath115 \\cos \\left({% k_0 ct + k_1 \\ell}\\right ) + \\ell \\eqno(28)\\ ] ]    \\b ) the relative distance between @xmath96 and @xmath116 initially at @xmath117 @xmath118    @xmath119    @xmath120    \\c ) the relative distance between @xmath96 and @xmath121 initially at @xmath122 @xmath123    a remarkable result is the existence of a longitudinal displacement @xmath124 .",
    "so the sphere of particles surrounding the central mass @xmath96 is transformed into a triaxial ellipsoid , as we showed in the figures of a previous paper@xcite .",
    "this effect is absent in the standard transverse gravitational waves@xcite , while it was predicted by grishchuk and sazhin@xcite for their standing gravitational waves produced by an electromagnetic generator .",
    "the determination of the amplitude in the previous section allows to estimate the magnitude of the shift of the test particles and opens the possibility to perform an experimental test",
    ". furthermore it would be useful to measure also a quantity that depends neither on the constant @xmath23 ( and hence on the way used to fix it ) , nor on the polarization tensor .",
    "to this aim we can simply compute the direction of the shift , for example , of @xmath116 and the resulting angle @xmath125 is such that @xmath126 } \\tan(k_0 ct ) \\eqno(33)\\ ] ] and changes quickly with time , so it can not be useful for a test . in the limit @xmath127 ( the source s velocity @xmath128 ) the shift occurs in the direction of the line joining the two particles just like the standard gravitational waves .",
    "but if we consider the case :    \\d ) the shift between @xmath96 and @xmath129 at @xmath130    we can compute , in the limit @xmath127 , the angle @xmath131 in the @xmath132 - plane between the direction of the shift and the x - axis .",
    "it depends on the initial position @xmath98 of the test particle : @xmath133 \\eqno(34)\\ ] ] the dependence of the shift angle @xmath131 only on @xmath98 is a typical feature of these waves and it is shown in fig . 1",
    "of course the angle with the line joining the two particles is @xmath134 and it is different from what happens with the standard gravitational waves . due to the fact that @xmath131 depends neither on the time , nor on @xmath23",
    ", it could be used as a constant measurable quantity in an experimental test even better than the shift depending on @xmath23 .",
    "in some previous papers@xcite we studied a particular solution ( 6 ) of the linearized einstein equations that can play the same role of the de broglie wave of quantum mechanics , but we left undetermined an arbitrary constant @xmath23 . in this letter , we have finally found a method to fix the constant , and hence the amplitude of this special gravitational wave , starting from the estimation of the corresponding energy - momentum tensor .",
    "now we can write down the complete solution in the form : @xmath135 the result , not _ a priori _ given for granted , is very interesting because the wave associated to the quantum particle disappears in the limit @xmath0 and when the source has a large mass or volume just as it was expected .",
    "furthermore , the knowledge of the magnitude of the wave opens the possibility to see experimental effects that in some cases could be more evident with respect to the standard gravitational waves . for example , a longitudinal shift or a direction of the shift not along the line joining the two test particles , are peculiar effects caused by our waves .",
    "finally , a measurement of a particular `` shift angle '' that depends only on the relative initial position of the two test particles has been proposed .",
