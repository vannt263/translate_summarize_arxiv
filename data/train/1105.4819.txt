    "it belongs to the general family of paraparticle algebras intimately related to the wigner quantization scheme @xcite . the  _ free _ \" paraparticle algebras ( parabosonic and parafermionic algebras ) have been -implicitly- introduced in the early 50 s @xcite while the  _ mixed _ \" paraparticle models such as @xmath3 ( and a couple of others as well ) have been first introduced in @xcite .    the algebra @xmath0 is generated ( as an algebra over @xmath4 ) by the four generators @xmath5 subject to the usual trilinear relations of the _ free parabosonic _ and the _ free parafermionic _ algebras which can be compactly summarized as @xmath6 = ( \\epsilon - \\eta)b^{\\xi } + ( \\epsilon - \\xi)b^{\\eta }     & , & \\big [ [ f^{\\xi } ,   f^{\\eta } ] , f^{\\epsilon }   \\big ] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\epsilon - \\eta)^{2 } f^{\\xi } - \\frac{1}{2}(\\epsilon - \\xi)^{2 } f^{\\eta }   \\end{array}\\ ] ] for all values @xmath7 ,  together with the _ mixed trilinear relations _ @xmath8 = \\big [ [ f^{\\xi } ,   f^{\\eta } ] , b^{\\epsilon }   \\big ] = 0 ,   & \\big [ \\ { f^{\\xi } ,   b^{\\eta}\\ } , b^{\\epsilon }   \\big ] = ( \\epsilon - \\eta ) f^{\\xi } ,   & \\big\\ { \\ { b^{\\xi } ,   f^{\\eta}\\ } , f^{\\epsilon }   \\big\\ } = \\frac{1}{2}(\\epsilon - \\eta)^{2 } b^{\\xi } % \\\\",

    "produces @xmath11 relations and equations produce @xmath12 relations .",
    "one can easily see ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) that not all of these @xmath13 are algebraically independent . however , we keep the relations in the form given in equations , and we do not proceed in further simplifying them , because of the compact notational and computational advantages of this presentation .",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this letter , will be to present the construction of a class of representations for the relations , .",
    "we will present an infinite class of irreducible , @xmath14graded representations of these relations .",
    "this class will be parametrized by the values of a positive integer @xmath1 ( similarly to the way that the free parabosonic and parafermionic algebra fock  like spaces are parametrized by the values of a positive integer ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 will be called _",
    "generalized parastatistics order_. it will be shown that the @xmath15 generators act as  ladder \" operators ( _ creation / annihilation _ operators ) in a kind of two  dimensional  ladder \" , generalizing thus the way that the usual canonical commutation  anticommutation relations ( ccr  car ) are represented in their fock spaces and also the way that the single degree of freedom free parabosonic and free parafermionic algebras act in their own fock",
    " spaces @xcite respectively .",
    "in this section we are going to briefly review the results of @xcite on the construction of the fock  like spaces , which will serve as carrier spaces for the fock  like representations of @xmath0 .",
    "an old conjecture @xcite on the study of the representations of the paraparticle algebras , states that if we consider representations of @xmath0 , satisfying the adjointness conditions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , on a complex , infinite dimensional , pre ",
    "hilbert space , possessing a unique vacuum vector @xmath18 satisfying @xmath19 and @xmath20 then the following additional conditions ( where @xmath1 may be an arbitrary positive integer ) @xmath21 single out an irreducible representation which is unique up to unitary equivalence . in other words the above statement , tells us that for any positive integer @xmath1 there is an irreducible representation of @xmath0 uniquely specified ( up to unitary equivalence ) by the above relations .",
    "we now proceed in summarizing the results of @xcite : the carrier spaces of the fock  like representations of @xmath0 are @xmath22 where @xmath1 is an arbitrary ( but fixed ) positive integer .",
    "the subspaces @xmath23 are 2dim except for the cases @xmath24 , @xmath25 i.e. except the subspaces @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 which are 1dim .",
    "let us see how the corresponding vectors look like :    @xmath29 , then the subspace @xmath23 is spanned by all vectors of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( for @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 ( for @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 .",
    "for any specific combination of values @xmath38 the corresponding subspace @xmath23 has a basis consisting of the two vectors ( @xmath39 for @xmath40 ) @xmath41    @xmath29 , the vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 are ( by definition ) zero and furthermore , for @xmath44 , the vector @xmath45 becomes parallel to @xmath46 : @xmath47    @xmath29 , all basis vectors of vanish .",
    "_ note 1 : _ the above described subspaces of @xmath22 can be visualized as follows :    @xmath29 inside each one of the above presented @xmath11dim subspaces @xmath23 ( with @xmath44 , @xmath48 ) the vectors of are linearly independent and constitute a basis",
    ". however , these vectors are neither orthogonal nor normalized .",
    "we can show that an orthonormal set of basis vectors can be obtained as + @xmath49 + where @xmath50 are suitable normalization factors @xcite .",
    "now we can show orthonormalization @xmath51 and completeness @xmath52 .",
    "_ note 2 : _ if we consider the hermitian operators @xmath53 , @xmath54+\\frac{p}{2}$ ] and @xmath55 we can show that they constitute a _",
    "complete set of commuting observables _ ( _ c.s.c.o .",
    "_ ) : we have @xmath56=[n_{b } , n_{s}]=[n_{f } , n_{s}]=0 $ ] ; their common eigenvectors are exactly the elements of the orthonormal basis formerly described .",
    "any vector @xmath57 is uniquely determined as an eigenvector of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 by its eigenvalues @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "for detailed computations and proofs of the results presented in this section see @xcite .",
    "we now present the formulae describing explicitly the action of the generators ( and hence of the whole algebra ) of @xmath0 on the carrier spaces @xmath64 for any positive integer @xmath1 : @xmath65 for all integers @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the direct proof @xcite of these formulae involves lengthy ",
    "normal  ordering \" algebraic computations inside @xmath0 .",
    "we must take into account : @xmath66 the relations , of @xmath0 , @xmath67 the relations together with @xmath68 and @xmath69 the structure and properties of the corresponding carrier space as described in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] .    apart from the direct proof , eq .",
    "have also been checked and verified via the http://homepage.cem.itesm.mx/lgomez/quantum/[quantum ] @xcite add  on for mathematica 7.0 , which is an add - on for performing symbolic algebraic computations , including the use of generalized dirac notation .",
    "what we have actually verified via the use of this package , is that the actions formulae preserve all of the relations , of @xmath0 .      in the following diagram",
    "we provide a  visual \" interpretation of relations i.e. of the action of the generators of @xmath0 on the direct summand subspaces of the fock - like carrier space @xmath64 .",
    "we can easily figure out that we have a kind of _ generalized creation ",
