    "we study in this paper how attaching of a lagrangian handle in the sense of @xcite to a symplectic manifold with contact boundary affects symplectic invariants of the manifold and contact invariants of its boundary .",
    "we establish several surgery exact triangles for these invariants . as explained in section [ sec : lefschetz ] below , symplectic handlebody presentations and lefschetz fibration presentations of liouville symplectic manifolds are closely related . in this sense",
    "our results can be viewed as generalizations of p.  seidel s exact triangles for symplectic dehn twists , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , as shown in the appendix written by s.  ganatra and m.  maydanskiy , our results imply p.  seidel s conjecture from @xcite .",

    "these are :    * theorems [ thm : f - ch ] , and [ thm : f - sh1 ] respectively [ thm : sh ] , which describe surgery exact triangles for linearized contact homology , and reduced respectively full symplectic homology ; * corollary [ cor : sh - subcrit ] , which gives a closed form formula for symplectic homology ; * theorem [ thm : lha ] , which relates the legendrian homology algebras of a legendrian submanifold before and after surgery ; and * theorem [ thm : lh ] , which provides a formula for the linearized legendrian homology of the so - called co - core ( the meridian of the handle ) legendrian sphere after surgery .",
