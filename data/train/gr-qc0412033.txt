    "the late - time dynamics of astronomical binaries consisting of neutron stars and/or black holes is dominated by relativistic motion and non - linear general relativistic effects .",
    "the component bodies would be accelerated to velocities close to half the speed of light before they plunge towards each other , resulting in a violent event during which the source would be most luminous in the gravitational window .",
    "such events are prime targets of interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors like ligo / virgo / geo / tama that are currently taking data at unprecedented sensitivity levels and bandwidths @xcite .",
    "binary coalescences are the end state of a long period of adiabatic dynamics in which the orbital frequency of the system changes as a result of gravitational radiation backreaction but the change in frequency per orbit is negligible compared to the orbital frequency itself .",
    "indeed , the adiabatic inspiral phase is well - modelled by the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to einstein s equations but this approximation becomes less accurate close to the merger phase .",
    "additionally , there are different ways of casting the gravitational wave phasing formula  the formula that gives the phase of the emitted gravitational wave as a function of time and the parameters of the system .",
    "these different approaches make use of the post - newtonian expansions of the binding energy and gravitational wave luminosity of the system .",
    "the standard approach in deriving the phasing formula uses the _",
    "specific _ gravitational binding energy @xmath2 ( i.e. the binding energy per unit mass ) of the system and its luminosity @xmath3 both to the same relative accuracy @xcite . including the radiation reaction at dominant order , however , is not a first order correction to the dynamics of the system , rather it is a correction that arises at @xmath4,$ ] where @xmath5 is the post - newtonian expansion parameter describing the velocity in the system and @xmath6 is the speed of light .. ] thus , the phasing of the waves when translated to the relative motion of the bodies implies that the dynamics is described by the dominant newtonian force and a correction at an order @xmath7 but neglecting conservative force terms that occur at orders @xmath8 and @xmath9 such considerations have led to an approximation scheme in which one constructs the phasing of gravitational waves using the following ordinary , coupled differential equations : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the total mass of the binary . the phasing obtained by numerically solving the above set of differential equations",
    "is called the _ taylort1 _",
    "approximant @xcite .",
    "if the detector s motion can be neglected during the period when the wave passes through its bandwidth then the response of the interferometer to arbitrarily polarized waves from an inspiralling binary is given by @xmath13 , \\label{eq : waveform1}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is defined so that it is zero when the binary coalesces at time @xmath15 @xmath16 is the phase of the signal at @xmath17 @xmath18 is the symmetric mass ratio , @xmath19 is the distance to the source and @xmath20 is a numerical constant whose value depends on the relative orientations of the interferometer and the binary orbit .",
    "it suffices to say for the present purpose that for an optimally oriented source @xmath21    one can compute the fourier transform @xmath22 of the waveform given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : waveform1 ] ) using the stationary phase approximation : @xmath23 } , \\label{eq : waveform2}\\ ] ] where the phase of the fourier transform obeys a set of differential equations given by @xmath24 in the above expressions , including the post - newtonian expansions of the energy and flux functions , the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the waveform eq.([eq : waveform2 ] ) computed by numerically solving the differential equations eq.([eq : phasing2 ] ) is called _ taylorf1 _ @xcite approximant .    before we proceed further ,",
    "let us recall the notation used in post - newtonian theory to identify different orders in the expansion . in the conservative dynamics of the binary , wherein there is no dissipation , the energy is expressed as a post - newtonian expansion in @xmath26 with the dominant order termed newtonian or 0pn and a correction at order @xmath27 @xmath28 called @xmath29pn , with the dynamics involving only even powers of @xmath30 when dissipation is added to the dynamics , then the equation of motion will have terms of both odd and even powers of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , a correction of order @xmath32 is termed as @xmath33pn .    in the adiabatic approximation of a test - particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "the energy function @xmath2 is exactly calculable analytically , while the flux function @xmath34 is exactly calculable numerically @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath34 has been calculated analytically to 5.5pn order  @xcite by black hole perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the case of a general binary including bodies of comparable masses , the energy function @xmath2 has been calculated recently to 3pn accuracy by a variety of methods @xcite .",
    "the flux function @xmath3 on the other hand , has been calculated to 3.5pn accuracy @xcite up to now only by the multipolar - post - minkowskian method and matching to a post - newtonian source  @xcite .",
    "the gravitational wave flux arising from the lowest order quadrupole formula , that is the 0pn order flux , leads to an acceleration of order _",
    "2.5pn _ in the equations - of - motion .",
    "this far - zone computation of the flux requires a control of the dynamics , or acceleration , to only _",
    "newtonian _ accuracy .",
    "the lowest order gw phasing in the adiabatic approximation uses only the leading terms in the energy ( newtonian ) and flux ( quadrupolar ) functions . for higher order phasing ,",
    "the energy and flux functions are retained to the same relative pn orders .",
    "for example , at 3pn phasing , both the energy and flux functions are given to the same _ relative _ 3pn order beyond the leading newtonian order .",
    "we refer to this usual physical treatment of the phasing of gws computed in the adiabatic approximation , and used in the current ligo / virgo / geo / tama searches for the radiation from inspiralling compact binaries , as the _ standard adiabatic _ approximation .",
    "we will denote the @xmath29pn _ standard adiabatic _ approximant as @xmath35},{\\cal f}_{n})$ ] , where @xmath36 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath37 .    as a prelude to go beyond the standard adiabatic approximation ,",
    "let us consider the phasing of the waves in terms of the equations of motion of the system . to this end",
    ", it is natural to order the pn approximation in terms of its dynamics or acceleration . from the viewpoint of the dynamics ,",
    "the leading order standard adiabatic approximation is equivalent to using the 0pn ( corresponding to 0pn conserved energy ) and 2.5pn ( corresponding to the newtonian or 0pn flux ) terms in the acceleration ignoring the intervening 1pn and 2pn terms .",
    "a complete , mathematically consistent treatment of the acceleration , however , should include _ all _ pn terms in the acceleration up to 2.5pn , _ without any gaps_. we refer to the dynamics of the binary , and the resulting waveform , arising from the latter as the 0pn _ complete non - adiabatic _ approximation .",
    "in contrast , the waveform arising from the former choice , with gaps in the acceleration at 1pn and 2pn , is referred to as the 0pn _ standard non - adiabatic _ approximation .",
    "extension to higher - order phasing is obvious . at 1pn",
    "the standard non - adiabatic approximation would involve acceleration terms at orders 0pn , 1pn , 2.5pn and 3.5pn , whereas the complete non - adiabatic approximation would additionally involve the 2pn and 3pn acceleration terms .",
    "finally , we propose a simple extension of the above construction to generate a new class of approximants in the adiabatic regime . to understand the construction let us examine the lowest order case .",
    "given the 0pn flux ( leading to an acceleration at 2.5pn ) , one can choose the energy function at 2pn ( equivalent to 2pn conservative dynamics ) instead of the standard choice 0pn ( equivalent to 0pn or newtonian conservative dynamics ) .",
    "this is the adiabatic analogue of the complete non - adiabatic approximant .",
    "extension to higher pn orders follows naturally .",
    "for instance , corresponding to the flux function at 1pn ( 1.5pn ) , the dissipative force is at order 3.5pn ( 4pn ) , and , therefore , the conservative dynamics , and the associated energy function , should be specified up to order 3pn ( 4pn ) . in general , given the flux at @xmath29pn - order ,",
    "a corresponding complete adiabatic approximant is constructed by choosing the energy function at order @xmath38$]pn , where as mentioned before , @xmath36 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath37 .",
    "we refer to the dynamics of the binary and the resulting waveform arising from such considerations , as the _ complete adiabatic _ approximation .",
    "we will denote the @xmath29pn _ complete adiabatic _ approximant as @xmath39},{\\cal f}_{n})$ ] .    before moving ahead",
    "the following point is worth emphasizing : the standard adiabatic phasing is , by construction , consistent in the _ relative pn _ order of its constituent energy and flux functions , and thus _ unique _ in its ordering of the pn terms .",
    "consequently , one can construct different inequivalent , but consistent , approximations as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite by choosing to retain the involved functions or re - expand them .",
    "the complete adiabatic phasing , on the other hand , is constructed so that it is consistent in spirit with the underlying dynamics , or acceleration , rather than with the relative pn orders of the energy and flux functions .",
    "consequently , it has a unique meaning only when the associated energy and flux functions are used _ without any further re - expansions _ when working out the phasing formula .",
    "as a result , though the complete non - adiabatic approximant is more consistent than the standard non - adiabatic approximant in treating the pn accelerations , in the adiabatic case there is no rigorous sense in which one can claim that either of the approximants is more consistent than the other .",
    "the important point , as we shall see is that , not only are the two approximants _ not _ the same but the new complete adiabatic approximants are closer to the exact solution than the standard adiabatic approximants .    in our view",
    ", these new approximants should be of some interest .",
    "they are simple generalizations of the _ standard adiabatic _ approximants coding information of the pn dynamics beyond the standard approximation without the need for numerical integration of the equations of motion",
    ". they should be appropriate approximants to focus on when one goes beyond the adiabatic picture and investigates the differences stemming from the use of more complete equations of motion ( see section [ sec : non - adiabatic models ] ) .    in the case of comparable mass binaries , the energy function",
    "is currently known up to 3pn order and hence it would be possible to compute the complete adiabatic phasing of the waves to only 1pn order .",
    "one is thus obliged in practice to follow the standard adiabatic approximation to obtain the phasing up to 3.5pn order .",
    "consequently , it is a relevant question to ask how ` close ' are the complete and standard adiabatic approximants .",
    "the standard adiabatic approximation would be justified if we can verify that it produces in most cases a good lower bound to the mathematically consistent , but calculationally more demanding , complete adiabatic approximation . in this paper",
    "we compare the standard and complete models by explicitly studying their overlaps with the exact waveform which can be computed in the adiabatic approximation of a test mass motion in a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the availability , in this case , of the exact ( numerical ) and approximate ( analytical ) waveforms to as high a pn order as @xmath40 , allows one to investigate the issue exhaustively , and provides the main motivation for the present analysis .",
    "assuming that the comparable mass case is qualitatively similar and a simple @xmath41-distortion of the test mass case would then provide a plausible justification for the standard adiabatic treatment of the gw phasing employed in the literature - distortion of the test mass approximation is not universal .",
    "in particular , blanchet @xcite has argued that the dynamics of a binary consisting of two bodies of comparable masses is very different from , and possibly more accurately described by post - newtonian expansion than , the test mass case . ] .",
    "-derivative of ) energy function @xmath42 ( left ) , and flux function @xmath43 ( right ) in the test mass limit along with the exact functions ( denoted by @xmath44 ) .",
    "also plotted is the amplitude spectral density ( per @xmath45 ) of initial ligo noise in arbitrary units.,width=480 ]      the phasing formulas derived under the various adiabatic approximation schemes assume that the orbital frequency changes slowly over each orbital period . in other words , the change in frequency @xmath46 over one orbital period @xmath47",
    "is assumed to be much smaller than the orbital frequency @xmath48 denoting by @xmath49 the time - derivative of the frequency , the adiabatic approximation is equivalent to the assumption that @xmath50 or @xmath51 this assumption becomes somewhat weaker , and it is unjustified to use the approximation @xmath52 when the two bodies are quite close to each other .",
    "buonanno and damour @xcite introduced a non - adiabatic approach to the two - body problem called the _ effective one - body _ ( eob ) approximation . in this approximation one",
    "solves for the relative motion of the two bodies using an effective hamiltonian with a dissipative force put - in by hand .",
    "eob allows to extend the dynamics beyond the adiabatic regime , and the last stable orbit , into the plunge phase of the coalescence of the two bodies @xcite .",
    "recently , buonanno , chen and vallisneri @xcite have studied a variant of the non - adiabatic model but using the effective lagrangian constructed in the post - newtonian approximation .",
    "we shall use both the _ standard _ and _ complete _ non - adiabatic lagrangian models in this study and see how they converge to the exact waveform defined using the adiabatic approximation for a caveat in this approach . ] .      in our study we will use the _ effectualness _ and _ faithfulness _ ( see below ) to quantify how good the various approximation schemes are .",
    "there are at least three different contexts in which one can examine the performance of an approximate template family relative to an exact one .",
    "firstly , one can think of a mathematical family of approximants and examine its convergence towards some exact limit .",
    "secondly , one can ask whether this mathematical family of approximants correctly represents the gws from some physical system .",
    "thirdly , how does this family of approximate templates converge to the exact solution in the sensitive bandwidth of a particular gw detector . in the context of gw data analysis",
    ", the third context will be relevant and studied in this paper .",
    "although there is no direct application to gw data analysis , equally interesting is the mathematical question concerning the behavior of different approximations , and the waveforms they predict , in the strongly non - linear regime of the dynamics of the binary , which is also studied in this paper .",
    "the latter obviously does not require the details of the detector - sensitivity and it is enough to study the problem assuming a flat power spectral density ( i.e. a _ white - noise _ background ) for the detector noise .    to summarize ,",
    "our approach towards the problem will be two - pronged .",
    "first , we will study the problem as a general mathematical question concerning the nature of templates defined using pn approximation methods .",
    "we shall deal with four families of pn templates  the standard adiabatic , complete adiabatic , standard non - adiabatic and complete non - adiabatic ( in particular , lagrangian - based ) approximants  and examine their closeness , defined by using effectualness and faithfulness , to the exact waveform defined in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "since this issue is a general question independent of the characteristics of a particular gw detector , we first study the problem assuming the white - noise case . having these results",
    ", we then proceed to see how and which of these results are applicable to a specific detector , namely the initial ligo . by  @xcite , @xmath53 $ ] where @xmath54 hz and the psd rises steeply below a lower cut - off @xmath55 hz . ] during the course of this study , we also attempt to assess the relative importance of improving the accuracy of the energy and flux functions by studying the overlaps of the pn templates constructed from different orders of energy and flux functions with the exact waveform .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this work is solely restricted to the inspiral part of the signal and neglects the plunge and quasi - normal mode ringing phases of the binary  @xcite .      in order to measure the accuracy of our approximate templates",
    "we shall compute their overlap with a fiducial exact signal .",
    "we shall consider two types of overlaps  @xcite .",
    "the first one is the _ faithfulness _ which is the overlap of the approximate template with the exact signal computed by keeping the intrinsic parameters ( e.g. the masses of the two bodies ) of both the template and the signal to be the same but maximizing over the extrinsic ( e.g. the time - of - arrival and the phase at that time ) parameters .",
    "the second one is the _ effectualness _ which is the overlap of the approximate template with the exact signal computed by maximizing the overlap over both the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters .",
    "faithfulness is a measure of how good is the template waveform in both detecting a signal and measuring its parameters .",
    "however , effectualness is aimed at finding whether or not an approximate template model is good enough in detecting a signal without reference to its use in estimating the parameters . as in previous studies ,",
    "we take overlaps greater than 96.5% to be indicative of a good approximation .      in the next section we study the test - mass waveforms in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we discuss the construction of the exact energy and flux functions as well as the respective t - approximants .",
    "the overlaps of various standard adiabatic and complete adiabatic approximants are also compared in this section .",
    "section [ sec : non - adiabatic models ] deals with the non - adiabatic approximation .",
    "section [ sec : compmass ] explores the extension of the results in the comparable mass case .",
    "it presents the energy and flux functions which are the crucial inputs for the construction of the fiducial ` exact ' waveform as well as the approximate waveforms followed by a discussion of the results . in the last section we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "one of the main conclusions of this paper is that the effectualness of the test - mass approximants significantly improves in the complete adiabatic approximation at pn orders below 3pn .",
    "however , standard adiabatic approximants of order @xmath1 3pn are nearly as good as the complete adiabatic approximants for the construction of effectual templates . in the comparable mass case",
    "the problem can be only studied at the lowest two pn orders .",
    "no strong conclusions can be drawn as in the test mass case .",
    "still , the trends indicate that the standard adiabatic approximation provides a good lower bound to the complete adiabatic approximation for the construction of both effectual and faithful templates at pn orders @xmath1 1.5pn . from the detailed study of test - mass templates",
    "we also conclude that , provided the comparable mass case is qualitatively similar to the test mass case , neither the improvement of the accuracy of energy function from 3pn to 4pn nor the improvement of the accuracy of flux function from 3.5pn to 4pn will result in a significant improvement in effectualness in the comparable mass case . as far as faithfulness is concerned , it is hard to reach any conclusion . to achieve the target sensitivity of 0.965 in effectualness corresponding to a 10% loss in the event - rate , standard adiabatic approximants of order 2pn and 3pn",
    "are required for the @xmath56 and @xmath57 binaries , respectively , when restricting to only the inspiral phase .",

    ", we would also like to have an understanding of the the relative importance of improving the accuracy of the energy function and flux function .",

    "it is worth stressing that this result is relevant only for the family of inspiral waveforms . in the real physical case of bh - bh binaries",
    "the inspiral family would not be adequate and must be supplemented by the plunge part of waveform as first discussed in @xcite and later in @xcite .",
    "a discussion of plunge requires a 3pn description of dynamics so that the 2pn templates are no longer adequate .",
    "this is an example of the second variety of questions one can study in this area referred to in our introduction related to whether a template family indeed represents the gws from a specific astrophysical system .",
    "we have also constructed both standard and complete non - adiabatic approximants using the lagrangian models in ref .",
    "however , we were limited in this investigation because of two reasons : firstly , the lagrangian models are available only up to 3.5pn order , and higher order pn accelerations are as yet unavailable which makes it impossible to calculate the _ complete non - adiabatic _ approximants of order @xmath91 1pn . secondly , the only _ exact _ waveform we have has , however been constructed only in the _ adiabatic _ approximation .",
    "so we are unable to make strong statements of general trends and view this effort only as a first step towards a more thorough investigation . from the non - adiabatic models studied ,",
    "the conclusion one can draw is that while complete non - adiabatic approximation improves the effectualness , it results in a decrease in faithfulness .",
    "there is a limitation to our approach which we should point out : complete adiabatic models can be very well tested in the test mass where both approximate and exact expressions are available for the various quantities .",
    "however , complete models can not be worked out to high orders in the comparable mass case since they need the energy function to be computed to 2.5pn order greater than the flux and currently the energy function is only known to 3pn accuracy .",
    "also , due to the lack of an exact waveform , one is constrained to depend upon some fiducial exact waveform constructed from the approximants themselves .",
    "though , in the present paper we have used the new approximants to construct waveform templates , one can envisage applications to discuss the dynamics of the binary using numerical integration of the equations of motion .    during the course of this study , we also attempted to assess the relative importance of improving the accuracy of the energy function and the flux function by systematically studying the approach of the adiabatic pn templates constructed with different orders of the energy and the flux functions to the exact waveforms . from the study of test - mass templates we also conclude that , provided the comparable mass case is qualitatively similar to the test mass case , neither the improvement of the accuracy of energy function from 3pn to 4pn nor the improvement of the accuracy of flux function from 3.5pn to 4pn will result in a significant improvement in effectualness in the comparable mass case",

    "<S> the _ standard adiabatic _ approximation to phasing of gravitational waves from inspiralling compact binaries uses the post - newtonian expansions of the binding energy and gravitational wave flux both truncated at the _ same relative _ post - newtonian order . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the eventual need to go beyond the adiabatic approximation we must view the problem as the dynamics of the binary under conservative post - newtonian forces and gravitational radiation damping . from the viewpoint of the dynamics of the binary , the standard approximation at leading order is equivalent to retaining the 0pn and 2.5pn terms in the acceleration and neglecting the intervening 1pn and 2pn terms . </S>",
    "<S> a complete mathematically consistent treatment of the acceleration at leading order should include all pn terms up to 2.5pn _ without any gaps_. these define the _ standard _ and _ complete _ _ non - adiabatic _ approximants respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new and simple _ complete adiabatic _ </S>",
    "<S> approximant constructed from the energy and flux functions . at the leading order it uses the 2pn energy function rather than the 0pn one in the standard approximation so that in spirit it corresponds to the dynamics where there are no missing post - newtonian terms in the acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the overlaps of the standard and complete adiabatic approximant templates with the exact waveform ( in the adiabatic approximation ) for a test - particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole . </S>",
    "<S> overlaps are computed using both the white - noise spectrum and the initial ligo noise spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the complete adiabatic approximants lead to a remarkable improvement in the _ effectualness _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. larger overlaps with the exact signal ) at lower pn ( @xmath0 3pn ) orders </S>",
    "<S> . however , standard adiabatic approximants of order @xmath1 3pn are nearly as good as the complete adiabatic approximants for the construction of effectual templates . in general , _ faithfulness _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. smaller biases in the estimation of parameters ) of complete approximants is also better than that of standard approximants . </S>",
    "<S> standard and complete approximants beyond the adiabatic approximation are next studied using the lagrangian models of buonanno , chen and vallisneri in the test mass limit . a limited extension of the results to the case of comparable mass binaries </S>",
    "<S> is provided . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> standard adiabatic approximants achieve an effectualness of 0.965 at order 3pn . </S>",
    "<S> if the comparable mass case is qualitatively similar to the test mass case then neither the improvement of the accuracy of energy function from 3pn to 4pn nor the improvement of the accuracy of flux function from 3.5pn to 4pn will result in a significant improvement in effectualness in the comparable mass case for terrestrial laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors . </S>"
