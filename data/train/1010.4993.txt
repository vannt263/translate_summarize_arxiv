    "for more than a decade , molecular electronics @xcite has been a very active and challenging field of research .",
    "one of the basic ideas is to exploit the diversity of molecules and the possibilities of modern synthesis to design molecular systems with specific functions for nanoscale electronic devices .",
    "another motivation is the possibility to investigate single molecules under controllable nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "various techniques , including mechanically controlled break junctions @xcite , electro - migrated molecular junctions @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite , and very recently , on - wire lithography in combination with _ in - situ _",
    "click chemistry @xcite , have been employed to contact a single molecule with two macroscopic electrodes .",
    "once such a molecular junction is established , external electric fields , either a bias or a gate voltage @xcite , can be used to investigate the conductance of a single molecule . a variety of interesting transport phenomena have been proposed and experimentally observed @xcite , including , _",
    "e.g. _ , switching behavior @xcite , rectification @xcite and negative differential resistance @xcite .",
    "however , a detailed understanding of the experimental results , especially in the resonant transport regime , where electrons may populate an intermediate state on the bridging molecule , has not been achieved yet .",
    "one of the interesting and challenging aspects of electron transport in molecular junctions is the intricate interplay between the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom . because of the small size of molecules , the charging of the molecular bridge",
    "is often accompanied by significant changes of the nuclear geometry that indicate strong coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom . as a consequence , the vibrational modes of a molecular junction can be highly excited resulting in significant nonequilibrium effects @xcite .",
    "this aspect distinguishes single - molecule junctions from traditional quantum dot systems @xcite .",
    "vibrational signatures indicating strong vibronic coupling as well as strong excitation of vibrational modes were identified for a number of molecular junctions @xcite .",
    "novel experimental techniques based on measuring the force needed to break a junction @xcite or employing raman spectroscopy @xcite allow a characterization of the current - induced vibrational nonequilibrium state of a single - molecule junction .",
    "these data complement the information carried by the respective current - voltage characteristics .",
    "various theoretical approaches have been employed to describe vibrationally coupled electron transport through single molecules .",
    "while scattering theory approaches @xcite can be used to address the regime of strong molecule - lead coupling , nonequilibrium green s function approaches @xcite additionally allow a non - perturbative description of the associated nonequilibrium state of such a junction , especially with respect to the vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "numerically exact methods , based on path integrals @xcite or multiconfigurational wave - function methods @xcite , provide valuable insights and benchmarks for specific model systems and problems that may not be addressed by perturbation theory or other approximative schemes .",
    "master equation approaches @xcite , although perturbative with respect to the coupling between the molecule and the leads , have been proven to be very powerful , as they are capable of describing all interactions on the molecular bridge accurately and , for simple model systems , very efficiently . in this work",
    ", we employ a master equation approach that is based on a second order expansion in the molecule - lead coupling @xcite .",
    "master equation approaches that take into account higher - order effects with respect to this coupling have already been employed @xcite .",
    "the corresponding higher - order transport processes @xcite , however , are beyond the scope of this work , where we focus on the resonant transport regime .    in this article , we analyze nonequilibrium transport phenomena induced by electronic - vibrational coupling in molecular junctions . to this end",
    ", we consider generic models for vibrationally coupled electron transport including electronic states on the molecular bridge that are vibrationally coupled and exhibit coulomb interaction .",
    "the results show a multitude of interesting phenomena that extend previous studies and may facilitate the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "in particular , it is found that the current - induced vibrational excitation in transport through a molecular bridge with a single electronic state increases significantly with increasing bias voltage and/or decreasing electronic - vibrational coupling .",
    "we show that this phenomenon is caused by electron - hole pair creation processes @xcite , which to the best of our knowledge have not been considered in detail in this context before .",
    "further analysis shows that electron - hole pair creation processes can also explain the strong enhancement of vibrational rectification effects in situations where the vibrational degree of freedom acquires a highly excited nonequilibrium state .",
    "this complements the analysis of the phenomenon of vibrational rectification given in ref .  .",
    "electronic - vibrational coupling may also cause vibrationally induced ndr effects @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we reinterpret the ndr - mechanism outlined in refs .   in terms of pair creation processes .",
    "furthermore , a novel mechanism for vibrationally induced ndr is discussed , which , in contrast to earlier studies @xcite , extends over a broad range of bias voltages .    in molecular junctions ,",
    "where multiple electronic states participate in the charge transport , a number of additional vibronic processes have to be considered .",
    "in particular , as we have shown recently @xcite , higher - lying electronic states facilitate resonant absorption processes that may deexcite the vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "this mechanism reduces the current - induced vibrational excitation of a molecular junction and results in local cooling @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we give a detailed analysis of effects due to multiple electronic states . in this context , we also show that repulsive coulomb interactions may further enhance the stability of a molecular junction ( cf .",
    "[ seccoulombcooling ] ) .",
    "we refer to this phenomenon as coulomb cooling. since polyatomic molecules typically include numerous active vibrational modes and often exhibit multiple closely lying electronic states , these phenomena are expected to be of relevance for most molecular junctions",

    "although resonant absorption processes are active , the mechanism of vibrational rectification restores the signatures of the individual molecular states .      in this and the following subsection",
    ", we study the effects of repulsive coulomb interactions ( @xmath233 ) on vibrationally coupled electron transport through a molecular junction .",
    "we first consider the influence of these interactions on resonant absorption processes , and thus on the stability of such a junction .",
    "ndr effects that arise due to repulsive coulomb interactions will be considered in sec .",
    "[ twostatendr ] .    to this end",
    ", we employ the same two - state model system as in sec .",
    "[ resonantabsorption ] , but add an additional charging energy of @xmath234ev in the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hel ] ) .",
    "this term accounts for repulsive coulomb interactions between two electrons that are occupying the two electronic states of the junction . as a consequence ,",
    "the resonance associated with the di - anionic state is shifted towards higher energies , from @xmath235 to @xmath236 .",
    "the resulting current - voltage characteristics ( data not shown ) shows the same features as analyzed in sec .",
    "[ resonantabsorption ] .",
    "the major difference between the two scenarios is a shift of all steps associated with the di - anionic state towards higher bias voltages . as a result ,",
    "the current increases more slowly in the resonant transport regime for @xmath237 .",
    "the respective vibrational excitation is shown in fig .",
    "[ coulombcooling]a .",
    "thereby , the solid black , red and blue lines directly correspond to the lines in fig .  [ resabprl2 ] , which were obtained using the same model parameters but without coulomb interaction .",
    "since resonant absorption processes with respect to the di - anionic resonance are shifted to higher energies , the level of vibrational excitation increases faster than without repulsive coulomb interactions for lower bias voltages . at higher bias voltages ,",
    "however , these cooling processes are more efficient than without coulomb interaction , as they require the absorption of less vibrational quanta .",
    "moreover , they are not competing with absorption processes associated with the excited state of the anion . as a result ,",
    "the vibrational excitation , which we obtain for large bias voltages including a repulsive coulomb interaction @xmath234ev , is reduced compared to that without additional electron - electron interactions .",
    "thus , repulsive coulomb interactions effectively stabilize a molecular junction .",
    "this cooling mechanism , here referred to as coulomb cooling is analyzed in more detail in fig .",
    "[ coulombcooling]b .",
    "the three different lines depict the difference in vibrational excitation , @xmath238 , obtained without , @xmath239ev , and with coulomb interaction , @xmath234ev , respectively .",
    "the comparison shows that , except for small bias voltages , the coulomb interactions lead to a strong reduction of the vibrational excitation and thus significant cooling @xcite .      in this last section ,",
    "we study ndr effects induced by coulomb interaction .",
    "first , we consider junctions with asymmetric molecule - lead coupling .",
    "as we have already seen , asymmetries in the molecule - lead couplings can cause strong changes in the populations of the electronic levels .",
    "this is particularly important in the presence of coulomb interactions , where they may result in pronounced ndr effects . to analyze this effect",
    ", we employ the same model parameters as in the previous section , except that the coupling of the higher - lying electronic state to the right lead is reduced to @xmath240ev .",
    "this parameter regime is known as a blocking - state scenario @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the energy of the higher - lying electronic state is chosen as @xmath241ev .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics depicted in fig .  [ coulombasymm ] shows that the combination of an asymmetry in the molecule - lead coupling and coulomb interactions results in a significant ndr effect at a bias voltage of @xmath210 .",
    "once the bias exceeds this value , @xmath226 , the second electronic state becomes almost fully occupied ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ coulombasymm ] ) .",
    "this effectively blocks electron transport through the first electronic state , because an additional charging energy @xmath215 is required , and the respective current drastically decreases .",
    "if the bias is increased further @xmath242 , transport through the first electronic state can take place , although the second electronic state remains partially occupied . for negative bias voltages , however , the second electronic state leaves almost no traces in the current - voltage characteristics , as it remains unoccupied . as a consequence ,",
    "ndr is not observed for this direction of the bias voltage .",
    "another interesting mechanism for ndr is observed if the higher - lying electronic state of the molecular junction is weakly , but symmetrically coupled to both leads , @xmath243ev .",
    "such a state corresponds to a molecular orbital , which is stronger localized in the central part of the junction . the solid red line in fig .",
    "[ coulombasymm2 ] represents the corresponding current - voltage characteristics .",
    "in contrast to the ndr effect discussed above , the current decreases over a broad range of bias voltages , from @xmath244 to @xmath245 . even for negative bias voltages , the absolute value of the current decreases from @xmath246 to @xmath247 .",
    "hence , this mechanism for ndr is symmetric with respect to bias .",
    "the decrease in the current is accompanied by an increase in the population of the second electronic state , which , as before , is blocking the current through the first electronic state .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ coulombasymm2 ] depicts the populations @xmath248 of both electronic states and shows the successive increase of @xmath249 .",
    "thereby , the higher - lying state , due to resonant absorption processes , becomes occupied even before it enters the bias window .",
    "increasing the bias voltage , the occupation number @xmath249 increases even further , as electronic tunneling processes and resonant emission processes become active .",
    "overall , this increase takes place in small steps , resulting in an almost smooth current - voltage characteristics .",
    "thus , transport through the lower - lying electronic state is not blocked in a single step , as for the ndr discussed before , but in a succession of several small steps , which results in a ndr feature that extends over a broad range of bias voltages .",
    "in this paper we have studied vibrationally coupled electron transport in single - molecule junctions . the study was based on generic models for molecular junctions , which include electronic states on the molecular bridge that are vibrationally coupled and exhibit coulomb interaction .",
    "the transport calculations employed a master equation approach , which is based on a second order expansion in the molecule - lead coupling . to the given order in the molecule - lead coupling , electronic - vibrational coupling and hubbard - like electron - electron interactions are accurately described in this approach .",
    "the results obtained for a series of models with increasing complexity , show a multitude of interesting transport phenomena , including vibrational excitation , rectification , negative differential resistance ( ndr ) as well as local cooling . while some of these phenomena have been observed or proposed before , the present analysis extends previous studies and allows a more detailed understanding of the underlying transport mechanisms .",
    "in particular , the analysis shows that many of the observed phenomena can not be explained if only transport - induced processes ( cf .  fig .  [ simpleemissionandabsorption ] ) are taken into account , but also require the consideration of electron - hole pair creation processes ( cf .",
    "[ el - h - pair - creation ] ) .",
    "for example , these processes explain the increase of the step heights in vibrational excitation with increasing bias voltage and/or smaller electronic - vibrational coupling .",
    "our results also show that in junctions with asymmetric molecule - lead coupling , electronic - vibrational interaction may result in a significant rectification of the current and the vibrational excitation , and even negative differential resistance .",
    "both phenomena are accompanied by an highly excited nonequilibrium state of the vibrational mode . in these cases ,",
    "electron - hole pair creation processes play a key - role .",
    "in contrast to transport - induced processes , they involve only one of the leads , and thus , effectively transfer the asymmetry of the molecule - lead coupling to the transport characteristics .    extending previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have also given a detailed analysis of the influence of multiple electronic states on vibronic effects in molecular junctions .",
    "the results show that resonant absorption processes involving higher - lying electronic states efficiently reduce the level of vibrational excitation and thus can stabilize a molecular junction over a broad range of bias voltages @xcite . in this context",
    ", we have shown that repulsive coulomb interactions , which shift these resonant absorption processes to higher energies , can strongly enhance this cooling mechanism ( coulomb cooling ) and thus improve the stability of the junction .",
    "repulsive coulomb interaction may also cause pronounced negative differential resistance ( ndr ) . while such ndr effects were reported before at specific values of the bias voltage @xcite , in the model proposed in this work ndr",
    "is caused by vibronic coupling and extents over a broad range of bias voltages .",
    "it should be noted that single - molecule junctions often exhibit a number of closely - lying electronic states , which are strongly coupled with the junctions vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , it can be expected that the phenomena analyzed in this work are of relevance for many molecular junctions and may facilitate the understanding and interpretation of experimental data .",
