    "theory of free fermions has been very successful in explaining properties of many condensed matter systems .",

    "integrable model of free fermions can be upgraded by taking into account several effects : ( i ) interaction  fermions can interact with each other , ( ii ) disorder  fermions can experience different local eigenenergies and , ( iii ) coupling  fermions can interact with external degrees of freedom .",
    "a non - perturbative inclusion of any of these effects greatly complicates the analysis forcing one to use various successful phenomenological theories  @xcite .",

    "we show that dephasing ( @xmath5 , yellow balls ) induces diffusive transport . ]    in the present work we shall study transport properties of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg model at infinite temperature in the presence of all the above mentioned effects : interaction , disorder and coupling to the environment . to our knowledge",

    "even though a clean heisenberg model without disordered magnetic field is explicitly solvable by the bethe ansatz and has been studied for several decades , its spin transport properties are far from being understood , for an overview see  @xcite . by using the jordan - wigner transformation",
    "it can be mapped to a system of strongly interacting spinless fermions , with @xmath10 being the interaction strength .",
    "therefore , the problem of spin transport in the heisenberg model is equivalent to that of particle ( charge ) transport in a system of interacting fermions . in the absence of coupling to the environment ,",
    "rigorous statements are available only for special cases without anisotropy ( interaction ) , @xmath2 , or in the case of no disorder , @xmath3 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] . for @xmath2",
    "the model is equivalent to a system of non - interacting fermions and can be described in terms of single - particle states that exhibit exponential localization in the presence of nonzero disorder , @xmath11 , resulting in a perfect insulating behavior due to anderson localization  @xcite .",
    "if disorder is zero the heisenberg model displays ballistic spin transport in a gapless phase for @xmath12  @xcite , while it is likely a diffusive spin conductor for @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this last result about diffusive transport in an integrable model , based mainly on numerical investigations , is somewhat unexpected and still lacks a deeper understanding , see though  @xcite for theoretical arguments supporting diffusive transport .",
    "as soon as interaction @xmath10 and disorder @xmath0 are both nonzero things get more complicated because one has to deal with a genuine many - body physics , for single - particle treatment see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "there are in fact opposing claims in the literature on whether the localization is destroyed or preserved in the presence of strong interaction ; some predict a phase transition from an insulating to a conducting regime at high temperature  @xcite , other numerical simulations , albeit on small systems , suggest localization even at an infinite temperature  @xcite or even ideal conducting behavior  @xcite .",
    "other non - equilibrium properties , like dynamics in various quantum quenches , has also been studied intensely in recent years , see  @xcite and references therein . for a recent study in 3d see  @xcite .",
    "besides its theoretical importance , heisenberg model is also experimentally realized in spin - chain materials  @xcite .",
    "it is argued that an anomalously high spin conductivity of the heisenberg model is required to explain large measured heat conductivity .",
    "while a detailed engineering of interactions in condensed - matter systems is probably out of question , experiments with cold gases in optical lattices could in near future lead to controlled experiments with strongly correlated many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to get a better understanding of the influence of the interplay between interaction , disorder and external coupling on the dynamics in such systems .",
    "we are going to study transport by numerically solving dynamical equations of motion , finding a non - equilibrium stationary state ( ness ) to which the system converges after long time .",
    "once we calculate ness we can evaluate various expectation values in that stationary non - equilibrium state .",
    "the dynamics of the system will be described by the lindblad master equation  @xcite , @xmath14 + { \\cal l}^{\\rm bath}(\\rho)+{\\cal l}^{\\rm deph}(\\rho ) .",

    "even though description in terms of lindblad equation , originating in quantum optics , has not been employed very often in condensed matter physics , it has been recently used in several works studying spin transport in the heisenberg model  @xcite .",
    "while a number of assumptions is involved in the derivation of the lindblad master equation from unitary evolution of a combined system  @xcite , markovian approximation can be justified because we are interested in the stationary state reached after long time , e.g. , much longer than the bath correlation time .",
    "apart from coupling to the bath the only non - unitary effect we take into account is dephasing . at high temperatures , which is the regime studied in the present work ,",
    "dephasing is the dominant environmental effect .",

    "dephasing ( also called phase damping or phase - flip in quantum information ) causes an exponential decay of the off - diagonal elements in the diagonal basis of @xmath32 ( in fermionic language this corresponds to the off - diagonal decay in the number basis ) . it might be interesting to note  @xcite that the dynamics of operators in the heisenberg model in the presence of dephasing , i.e. , evolution by the lindblad equation ( [ eq : lin ] ) , can be exactly mapped to the evolution of pure states in a one - dimensional non - hermitian hubbard model with complex on - site repulsion @xmath33",

    "after sufficiently long time the state @xmath35 converges to a time - independent ness .",

    "our numerical experience tells us that the homogeneity of the spin current can be used as a rather sensitive indicator of the convergence to ness as well as of truncation errors .      to determine whether the system is a normal or an anomalous conductor one has to study the scaling of the spin current with the system size",
