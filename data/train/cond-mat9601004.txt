    "the problem of a quantum particle confined to a two - dimensional tube consisting of two straight regions connected by a region of arbitrary curvature but constant width , @xmath2 , has aroused interest in recent years because of its applications in both the physics of small devices and electromagnetic waveguides.@xcite related geometries such as crossed wires@xcite and elbows@xcite have also been studied extensively .",
    "the primary focus has been on the existence of unanticipated bound states and on the `` adiabatic '' limit where the radius of curvature is always much greater than the width of the tube.@xcite goldstone and jaffe proved that such a tube always has a bound state , with energy below the continuum threshold at @xmath3.@xcite    in this paper , we study the specific case where the curved region is an arc of a circle .",
    "this case can be solved numerically with relative ease , providing a laboratory in which to explore phenomena we believe to be quite general but difficult to demonstrate in arbitrary geometries .",
    "we take the tube to have unit width .",
    "we use the arc length , @xmath4 , along the outer boundary of the tube as one coordinate , and the distance @xmath5 , along the normal from the outer boundary toward the center of the circle as the other coordinate .",
    "we mark the boundaries of the curved region as @xmath6 .",
    "the angle subtended by the arc of the curved region is defined to be @xmath7 , and it satisfies the relation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the curvature ( here a constant ) .",
    "figure [ tube ] shows two examples of such a tube .",
    "notice that we allow ourselves to consider tubes with @xmath10 although such configurations require excursions from strictly planar geometry . also , we choose units such that @xmath11 making @xmath12 dimensionless .    scattering in a bent tube is a relatively simple example of a multichannel problem .",
    "incoming and outgoing waves are labelled by an integer , @xmath13 , the number of non - trivial nodes in the transverse wavefunction , @xmath14 .",
    "the scattering is described by transmission and reflection matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 whose dimension grows as each successive channel threshold ( at @xmath17 ) is passed . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that the same argument which demonstrates the existence of a bound state , also proves that there is a `` quasibound '' state just below each channel threshold .",
    "the quasibound state below the @xmath18 channel threshold would be stable and normalizable if all lower channels ( @xmath19 ) were artifically closed .",
    "such quasibound states should appear as resonances in the open channel scattering amplitudes .",
    "our aim in considering this solvable special case is to explore the systematics of the bound states as they depend on @xmath9 and @xmath7 , and to elucidate the character of the channel threshold resonances .",
    "other workers have studied quantum wires with circular bends . lent studied scattering in tubes with @xmath20 and showed that even for the largest curvature tractible there is very little reflection except at values of the energy just above the threshold.@xcite sols and macucci have confirmed this result and discovered the presence of resonances associated with quasi - bound states just below propagation thresholds.@xcite moreover , they found that at large angles , more than one bound state may develop , and that the binding energy of these bound states increases as the curvature or angle is increased .    in ",
    "ii , we establish a formalism for solving for both bound and scattering states in tubes with circular bends .",
    "we begin traditionally  by representing the solution in the curved region in terms of bessel functions and imposing the standard continuity conditions at @xmath21 .",
    "normally one would match the open channels to incoming and outgoing waves and the closed channels to _",
    "falling exponentials_. the matching conditions generate a linear algebra problem , which leads eventually to an eigenvalue problem ( for the bound states ) and a solution for @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( for the scattering problem ) .",
    "however , we find that this approach leads to serious convergence problems at high curvature . at this point",
    "we abandon the traditional approach and formuate a novel method ( as far as we are aware ) where we match the interior wavefunction to _ both rising and falling exponentials _ in closed channels .",
    "we then seek solutions by minimizing the coefficients of the rising exponentials .",
    "we argue that this approach should converge more rapidly and reliably .",
    "we believe this method has wider application than the problem at hand .",
    "also in this section we derive a small @xmath9 approximation to the transmission amplitude in regions far from thresholds and resonances .",
    "in  iii we study the convergence of our method of calculating both scattering and bound states .",
    "we show that it is more convergent and more efficient than the traditional method ( of allowing only falling exponentials in closed channels ) .    in  iv , we present results for the bound state eigenenergies and the scattering coefficients as functions of curvature and angle .",
    "we show that at fixed curvature , further bound states appear with increasing @xmath7 . as @xmath22 , so does the number of bound states .",
    "the binding energy of the ground state approaches a limit determined by the root of a simple bessel equation as @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath23 the limit is the square of the first zero of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the higher bound state energies approach the same limit as the ground state , but more slowly .",
    "we also find the angle at which the first excited state appears , as a function of @xmath9 , and give a theoretical explanation why this angle approaches @xmath26 as @xmath9 approaches zero .",
    "we also plot the scattering coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 as functions of the energy and verify the presence of resonances associated with quasi - bound states just below the propagation threshold for each channel .",
    "finally , we explore the behavior of @xmath28 and @xmath27 in the complex plane .",
    "we explain why the elastic transmission amplitude @xmath29 drops to zero at the energy of the quasibound state just below the second threshold , @xmath30 , an effect which is echoed in other components of @xmath27 at higher thresholds . at the same time",
    "we verify the predictions of the small @xmath9 approximation for low curvature .",
    "in this section we summarize the basic formalism common to both the bound and scattering state problems .",
    "we then specialize to the bound state case and finally , to the scattering case .",
    "we are interested in the solutions to the wave equation , @xmath31 within a `` tube '' coordinatized by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath32 vanishes on the boundaries , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and we require that @xmath32 and and its normal derivative be continuous at @xmath21 where the curvature of the tube jumps abruptly from zero to @xmath9 .",
    "we treat the curved and straight regions at the same time , taking @xmath35 for the straight region .",
    "the coordinate differential is given by @xmath36 , and the differential area element is @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the wave equation becomes @xmath38 we now make the standard change of variable , @xmath39 so that eq .",

    "the linear combination of bessel functions in eq .",
    "( [ radial ] ) satisfies @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "the order , @xmath49 , must be chosen to satisfy @xmath47 at @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath49 may be either real or imaginary , as we discuss below .",
    "the label @xmath51 denotes the number of non - trivial nodes ( @xmath52 ) in @xmath53 .    to study the character of @xmath49 , we substitute eqs .",
    "( [ radial ] ) and ( [ s_l ] ) back into the wave equation .",
    "we find that the momentum satisfies the relation , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a positive term that grows with @xmath56 .",
    "thus , for fixed @xmath57 only a finite number of eigenvalues , @xmath58 , can be positive .",
    "for any @xmath57 greater than @xmath59 there is at least one positive @xmath60  a fact which is closely related to the existence of a bound state . as @xmath61 increases , more positive @xmath60 values appear  associated with the channel threshold resonances discussed below .",
    "let @xmath62 correspond to real @xmath63 and @xmath64 give imaginary @xmath63 , where we define @xmath65 .",
    "then , @xmath66 we have added the subscript `` @xmath67 '' to @xmath32 to denote the solution inside the circular region .",
    "depending on @xmath57 , the exterior solutions , @xmath68 , either oscillate or vary exponentially with @xmath4 .",
    "the general exterior solution is of the form , @xmath69 where @xmath70 when @xmath71 becomes imaginary and the solutions become oscillatory . in that case",
    "we define @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "we now apply continuity conditions at @xmath74 , recalling that in the interior region the normal derivative of @xmath75 is @xmath76 and we find @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "( [ match ] ) give an infinite dimensional matrix linear algebra problem to solve for the energies of bound states or the @xmath80matrix for scattering states . in practice",
    "we must truncate the sum over internal and external channels .",
    "we superpose @xmath81 internal solutions and attempt to match to @xmath82 external channels .    when @xmath83 the @xmath84 with @xmath85 are coefficients of exponentially rising solutions .",
    "because these solutions are not normalizable , standard practice is to dismiss them as unphysical and set @xmath84 for @xmath85 to zero from the beginning .",
    "this leads to an eigenvalue condition for @xmath61 which has unique solutions only when @xmath86 , _ i.e. _ one is forced to use channel spaces of the same dimension both inside and outside the region of curvature . as the dimension of this channel space @xmath87 is increased , the accuracy of the solution should improve .",
    "after all , it corresponds to taking more terms in the approximation to the wavefunction .",
    "however , we have found that this straightforward approach fails at high curvature ( @xmath88 ) . as the channel space dimension",
    "is increased , the solution does not seem to converge .",
    "we believe that this is due to poor matching at the boundary @xmath89 : we expect that an interior function with @xmath13 nodes should match to a superposition of exterior functions dominated by terms with @xmath13 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , _ etc . _ nodes .",
    "however , the @xmath92 restriction forbids the introduction of any exterior functions with higher frequencies than the interior functions , so that the @xmath93 , @xmath94 node terms are not present .",
    "clearly it would be advantageous to allow @xmath95 .",
    "however , a simple count of the number of degrees of freedom shows that the there is no solution under these circumstances .    to solve this problem ,",
    "we have implemented a novel approach : we retain the rising exponentials and seek first the set of @xmath96 and next the value of @xmath61 for which @xmath97 is minimized .",
    "as we shall see , this approach removes the @xmath86 restriction , allowing us to take as many terms in either sum as we like .",
    "of course , in the limit @xmath98 , @xmath99 in the closed channels for all physically interesting solutions , whether bound or scattering .",
    "bound states correspond to solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ match ] ) with @xmath100 .",
    "our strategy will be to allow the @xmath84 to be non - zero and seek solutions which minimize @xmath97 .",
    "we anticipate that the parity of the ground state will be even , so we choose internal solutions which are superpositions of @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "if there are several bound states , this symmetric _ ansatz _ will find the even ones .",
    "a corresponding _ ansatz _ odd under @xmath103 finds the odd states .",
    "even and odd bound states alternate as a function of the energy .",
    "we use the method of lagrange multipliers to minimize @xmath104 subject to the constraint that @xmath105 .",

    "the @xmath96 must be constrained in some way , otherwise the trivial solution @xmath106 will follow . the sensitivity of our method to the form of the constraint is discussed in the following section .",
    "we define @xmath107 and seek to minimize @xmath108 first with respect to the @xmath96 and then with respect to k. the conditions @xmath109 , lead to an algebraic problem , with a solution @xmath110 .",
