    "in 1989 witten derived knot invariants such as the jones polynomial from quantum field theory based on the chern - simon lagrangian @xcite . inspired by witten s work in this paper we shall derive knot invariants from a new gauge theory of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite @xcite . comparing to witten s work our approach will be simpler and more rigorous . in our approach",
    "we shall first derive the jones polynomial and then by a quantum group structure we derive new knot invariants which extend the jones polynomial .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] and section [ sec3 ]",
    "we give a brief description of a new gauge theory of qed and qcd . in this paper",
    "we shall consider a qcd with a @xmath0 gauge symmetry . with this new quantum field theory",
    "we introduce the partition function and the correlation of wilson loop which will be a knot invariant of the trivial knot .",
    "this correlation of wilson loop will later be generalized to be knot invariants of nontrivial knots . to investigate the properties of these partition function and correlations in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we derive a chiral symmetry from the gauge transformation of this new quantum field theory . from this chiral symmetry in section [ sec6 ] , section [ sec7 ]",
    "we derive a conformal field theory which contains topics such as the affine kac - moody algebra and the knizhnik - zamolodchikov equation .",
    "this kz equation is an equation of correlations from which in section [ sec9 ] we can derive the skein relation of the jones polynomial .",
    "a main point of our theory on the kz equation is that we can derive two kz equations which are dual to each other .",
    "from these two kz equations we derive a quantum group structure for the @xmath1 matrices from which a wilson loop is formed .",
    "then from the correlation of these @xmath1 matrices in section [ sec10 ] we derive new knot invariants which extend the jones polynomial and gives a classification of knots .",
    "to begin our derivation of knot invariants let us first describe a new quantum field theory .",
    "similar to the wiener measure for the brownian motion which is constructed from the integral @xmath2 we construct a measure for qed from the following energy integral : @xmath3ds \\label{1.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes the proper time in relativity ; @xmath5 denotes the electric charge and the complex variable @xmath6 , real variables @xmath7 , @xmath8 represent one electron and two photons respectively . by extending @xmath9",
    "to @xmath10 we get a quantum theory of qed where @xmath11 denotes the planck constant and @xmath12 is a constant related to absolute temperature .",
    "the integral ( [ 1.1 ] ) has the following gauge symmetry : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a real valued function .",
    "let us briefly give some physical motivations for the above qed theory . a main feature of ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "is that it is not formulated with the four - dimensional space - time . as most of the theories in physics are formulated with the space - time that we want to explain the reason of our formulation . we know that with the concept of space - time we have a convenient way to understand physical phenomena and to formulate theories of physics such as the newton equation , the schrodinger equation for quantum mechanics , e.t.c . to describe these phenomena .",
    "however we also know that there are fundamental difficulties related to the space - time such as the ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theory @xcite @xcite . to solve these difficulties let us reexamine the concept of space - time .",
    "we propose that the space - time is a statistical concept which is not as basic as the proper time in relativity @xcite .",
    "because a statistical theory is usually a convenient but incomplete description of a more basic theory this means that some difficulties may appear if we formulate a physical theory with the space - time .",
    "this also means that a way to formulate a basic theory of physics is to formulate it not with the space - time but with the proper time only as the parameter for evolution .",
    "this is a reason that we use ( [ 1.1 ] ) to formulate a qed theory . in this formulation",
    "we regard the proper time as an independent parameter which is not in terms of the space - time . from ( [",
    "1.1 ] ) we may obtain the conventional results in terms of space - time by introducing the space - time as a statistical method @xcite @xcite .",
    "let us explain in more detail how the space - time come out as a statistics . for statistical purpose",
    "when many electrons ( or many photons ) present we introduce space - time @xmath15 as a statistical method to write @xmath16 in the form @xmath17 and to write @xmath18 in the form @xmath19 we notice that for a given @xmath9 there may have many @xmath20 and @xmath21 which correspond to many electrons ( or photons ) such that ( [ l ] ) holds . in this way",
    "the space - time @xmath22 is introduced as a statistics . by these two relations",
    "we can derive statistical formulas for many electrons ( or photons ) from formulas obtained from ( [ 1.1 ] ) . in this way",
    "we may obtain the dirac equation as a statistical equation for electrons and the maxwell equation as a statistical equation for photons . from this statistical method and the form of ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "we may show that why electrons follow fermi - dirac statistics and photons follow bose - einstein statistics @xcite @xcite .",
    "we notice that the relation ( [ l ] ) is the famous lorentz metric . here",
    "our understanding of the lorentz metric is that it is a statistical formula where the proper time @xmath4 is more fundamental than the space - time @xmath22 in the sense that we first have the proper time and then the space - time is introduced via the lorentz metric only for the purpose of statistics .",
    "this reverses the order of the appearance of the proper time and the space - time in the history of relativity in which we first have the concept of space - time and then we have the concept of proper time which is introduced via the lorentz metric . once we understand that the space - time is a statistical concept from ( [ 1.1 ] ) we can give a solution to the debate about quantum mechanics between bohr and einstein @xcite @xcite . in this debate",
    "bohr insisted that with probability interpretation quantum mechanics is very successful . on",
    "the other hand einstein insisted that quantum mechanics is incomplete because of probability interpretation .",
    "he believed that god does not play dice . here",
    "we may solve this debate by constructing the above qed theory which is a quantum theory and unlike quantum mechanics it is deterministic since it is not formulated with the space - time . here",
    "we understand that quantum mechanics needs probability interpretation because it is formulated with the space - time which is a statistical concept .    from ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "we may derive qed effects including the abnormal magnetic moment and the lamb shift @xcite . because the proper time @xmath4 is an one dimensional parameter we have that this new qed theory is free of the difficulty of ultravoilet divergences and is a renormalizable theory .",
    "this is an original motivation that we set up ( [ 1.1 ] ) as a qed theory .",
    "we can generalize the above qed theory with @xmath23 gauge symmetry to qcd type theories with nonabelian gauge symmetry . as an illustration",
    "let us consider @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "similar to ( [ 1.1 ] ) we consider an energy integral @xmath24 of the following form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a two dimensional complex vector ; @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes a real component of a gauge field @xmath30 ; @xmath31 denotes a generator of @xmath0 ; and @xmath32 @xmath28 where @xmath33 denotes the charge of interaction . from ( [ n1 ] )",
    "we can develop a qcd type model as similar to that for the qed model .",
    "we have that ( [ n1 ] ) is invariant under the following gauge transformation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    since ( [ n1 ] )",
    "is not formulated with the space - time , as analogous to the approach of witten on knot invariants @xcite the following partition function will be shown to be a topological invariant for knots : @xmath37 where @xmath38 which may be called a wilson loop as analogous to the usual wilson loop @xcite where @xmath39 denotes a closed curve of the following form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a real valued function such that @xmath42 .",
    "this closed curve @xmath39 is in a two dimensional phase plane @xmath43 which is dual to @xmath44 .",

    "the notation @xmath45 in the definition of @xmath46 denotes a path - ordered product and @xmath47 denotes a representation of @xmath0 @xcite @xcite .",
    "we remark that we also extend the definition of @xmath46 to the case that @xmath39 is not a closed curve with @xmath48 .",
    "we shall show that ( [ n3 ] ) is a topological invariant for a trivial knot .",
    "this means that in ( [ n3 ] ) the closed curve @xmath39 represents a trivial knot",

    "our aim is to compute the above knot invariant and to derive the jones polynomials which are knot invariants for @xmath0 @xcite by using chern - simon quantum field theory .",

    "the order of the sequence in ( [ m14 ] ) follows the order of the parts given by the direction of the knot .",
