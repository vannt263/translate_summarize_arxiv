    "in @xcite , vaughan jones introduced the notion of index for type @xmath2 subfactors . to any finite index subfactor @xmath3 one can associate a tower of @xmath4 factors @xmath5 .",
    "the standard invariant of the subfactor is then given by the grid of finite dimensional algebras of relative commutants ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath6 sorin popa in @xcite studied the question of which families @xmath7 of finite - dimensional @xmath8-algebras could arise as the tower of relative commutants of an extremal finite - index subfactor , that is , when does there exist such a subfactor @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "he obtained a beautiful algebraic axiomatization of such families , which he called @xmath11__-lattices__. ocneanu gave a combinatorial description of the standard invariant as so called _ paragroups _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , jones gave a geometric reformulation of the standard invariant , which he called _",
    "planar algebras _",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "jones then introduced the notion of ` modules over a planar algebra ' in @xcite and computed the irreducible modules over the temperley - lieb planar algebras for index greater than @xmath12 .",
    "planar algebras became a powerful tool to construct subfactors of index less than @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , a new construction of the subfactors with principal graph , @xmath13 and @xmath14 could be given ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the author ( see @xcite ) established a one - to - one correspondence of all modules over the group planar algebra , that is , the planar algebra associated to the subfactor arising from the action of a finite group , and the representations of a non - trivial quotient of the quantum double of the group over a certain ideal .",
    "the reason for the appearance of a quotient of the quantum double instead of just the quantum double was allowing rotation of internal discs in the definition of the modules over a planar algebra .",
    "similar results also appeared in the field of tqfts .",
    "kevin walker and michael freedman proved that the representations of the _ annularization _ of a tensor category satisfying suitable conditions that allow one to perform the reshetikhin - turaev construction of tqft , is equivalent to the representations of the quantum double of the category .",
    "the author ( in @xcite ) also showed that the radius of convergence of the dimension of a module is at least as big as the inverse - square of the modulus in the case of group planar algebras and thus answering a question in @xcite .",
    "subfactors have been extensively studied from the point of view of the associated bicategory of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 bimodules ( see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is natural to expect a correspondence between the bicategory and the planar algebra associated to the subfactor .",
    "one of the main objectives of this paper is to construct a planar algebra directly from a bicategory .    from @xcite",
    ", it follows that if the modules over a planar algebra are defined with rigid internal disc then they are more interesting because of the connection with quantum double in the case of group planar algebras .",
    "another objective is to find such modules ( called _ affine representations _ ) and prove finiteness results of affine representation for finite depth planar algebras .",
    "next , we give a section - wise summary of the paper ; all results in this paper appeared in a phd thesis ( 2006 ) of the author submitted in university of new hampshire .",
    "in the first section , we discuss the preliminaries from basic category theory .",
    "the first subsection recalls the definition of multicategories and maps between them from @xcite .",
    "we introduce the notion of the stucture of _ empty objects _ in a multicategory ; the trivial example , namely , the multicategory of sets or vector spaces possess the structure of empty objects . in the second subsection , we discuss basics of bicategory theory and several structures related to a bicategory , namely functors , transformation between functors and rigidity .",
    "we construct a new example of a multicategory with the structure of empty objects which we call _ planar tangle multicategory _ in the second section .",
    "we re - define jones s planar algebra simply as a map of multicategories from the planar tangle multicategory to the multicategory of vector spaces ; in fact , this was motivated by jones s idea of putting the planar algebra as well as its dual in the definition itself . in the end , we discuss more structures ( modulus , connectedness , local finiteness , @xmath8- structure , etc . ) on a planar algebra .    in the third section , we start with fixing a @xmath0-cell in a pivotal strict @xmath1-category and construct a planar algebra .",
    "some of the techniques used here are similar to jones s construction of a planar algebra from a subfactor .",
    "however , we would like to mention that this construction is totally algebraic and heavily depends on the _ graphical calculus _ of the @xmath1-cells and the pivotal structure plays a key role here .",
    "motivated with the connection of annular representation of the group planar algebra with the representations of a certain quotient of the quantum double of the group , we considered _ affine representations _ of a planar algebra in the fourth section ; this was introduced by jones and reznikoff in @xcite and graham and lehrer in @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the general theory of such representations .    in the fifth and the final section",
    ", we discuss affine representations of a planar algebra associated to a finite depth subfactor .",
    "we find a bound on the weights of these representations which is dependent on the depth of the planar algebra .",
    "we also prove that at each weight , the number of isomorphism classes of irreducible affine representations is finite .",
    "we answer jones s question on the radius of convergence of the dimension of affine representations for finite depth subfactor planar algebras .",
