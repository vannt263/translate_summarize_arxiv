    "for quite some time , the additivity conjecture has been one of the most notorious open problems in quantum information theory ; it has been settled only recently in a breakthrough paper by hastings  @xcite .",
    "the original conjecture can be stated in several equivalent ways  @xcite ; one possible formulation is via the _ minimum output entropy _ of a quantum channel @xmath1 , defined as @xmath2 where the minimization is over all input states @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is von neumann entropy .",
    "the intuition is that @xmath5 is a measure of noisiness of the channel @xmath1 .",
    "the original additivity conjecture stated that @xmath6 for all channels @xmath1 and @xmath7 ; that is , the minimum output entropy of a pair of channels should be the sum of the individual minimum output entropies . during the years that the problem has been studied , it turned out to be convenient to generalize the additivity problem to _",
    "@xmath8-rnyi entropies _ : for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and density matrices @xmath3 , define  @xcite @xmath11 and then the question is whether @xmath12 holds true in general , for all @xmath9 . due to the limit",
    "@xmath13 , ( [ addconjp ] ) is a natural generalization of  ( [ addconj ] ) .",
    "quite surprisingly , it turned out that the conjectured equalities  ( [ addconjp ] ) and  ( [ addconj ] ) are both false in general .",
    "they were subsequently disproved by constructing counterexample channels , first for @xmath14  @xcite , then for @xmath15  @xcite , then for @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xcite , and finally for @xmath18  @xcite , killing the original conjecture  ( [ addconj ] ) . for detailed expositions of the problem and its history , see for example @xcite or @xcite .    despite those no - go results",
    ", it has been shown that additivity holds for many interesting classes of channels and several values of @xmath8 , for example for the cases that one of the channels is the identity channel  @xcite or a unital qubit channel  @xcite .",
    "even if additivity fails in general , its validity in special cases is still interesting in its own and potentially useful for channel coding problems , cf .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that some of those results for special channels have a natural interpretation within a more general framework .    to motivate our more general definition , notice first that the additivity conjecture can equivalently be stated as the assertion that _ entanglement does not help _ to produce pure outputs .",
    "in fact , equation  ( [ addconj ] ) holds if and only if the map @xmath19 attains its global minimum at an _ unentangled _ input state @xmath3 : since @xmath20 for density operators @xmath21 and @xmath3 , we get @xmath22 if @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the minimizers for the two channels , i.e. @xmath25 and similarly for @xmath24 .",
    "this means that the inequality `` @xmath26 '' in  ( [ addconj ] ) is always true .    on the other hand , as von neumann entropy is concave , the global minimum will be attained at some _ pure _ input state ; also , @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be chosen pure .",
    "thus , the fact that @xmath27 is indeed the global minimizer , i.e. `` @xmath28 '' holds in ( [ addconj ] ) , is equivalent to the fact that no other entangled input state can produce even smaller output entropy .",
    "equation  ( [ addconjp ] ) can be reformulated in a similar way : additivity for @xmath8-rnyi entropy with @xmath16 holds true if and only if the function @xmath29 attains its global maximum at an unentangled input state @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we have two variations of the same general problem : _ compute the trace of a convex function of the output , and decide whether this expression attains its global maximum at an unentangled input state .",
    "_ for von neumann entropy @xmath4 , this function is @xmath30 , while for the @xmath8-rnyi entropy @xmath31 with @xmath16 , this function is @xmath32 .",
    "it is natural to ask what happens if the problem is generalized .",
    "what if one takes another convex function , different from @xmath30 or @xmath32 ?",
    "we use definition  [ defentfn ] to study the generalized problem . in this definition and",
    "all of the following , applying a ( convex ) function @xmath33\\to{{\\mathbb r}}$ ] to a density matrix @xmath34 is meant in the sense of spectral calculus : diagonalizing @xmath35 , we define @xmath36 such that in particular @xmath37 , where the sum is over all eigenvalues @xmath38 of @xmath21 .    [ defentfn ]",
    "let @xmath33\\to{{\\mathbb r}}$ ] be a convex function , and let @xmath1 and @xmath7 be quantum channels .",
    "we say that @xmath39 is _ additive _ for @xmath40 if there exists some unentangled input state @xmath41 such that @xmath42 for all input states @xmath21 .    there are some simple consequences of this definition",
    ". first note that if @xmath39 is convex as a real function , then it is automatically a `` convex trace function '' on the density operators in the sense that @xmath43 see @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath44 attains its maximum on pure input states , i.e. ( [ eqdef ] ) is equivalent to the existence of pure states @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that @xmath47 yet , in contrast to von neumann or @xmath8-rnyi entropy , there is in general no way to further simplify the expression on the left - hand side by splitting the function of the tensor product into two addends or factors .",
    "clearly , this definition captures the additivity problems as special cases :    [ lemma2 ] let @xmath40 be a pair of quantum channels .",
    "then additivity of @xmath8-rnyi entropy @xmath48 holds if and only if the function @xmath49 is additive for @xmath40 , where @xmath50    hence proving the additivity conjecture for a pair of channels is equivalent to showing that @xmath30 is additive .",
    "is there any reason why this more general approach could help ?",
    "in fact , there is a popular example in matrix analysis where a similar strategy turned out to be successful , which is lwner s theory of operator convex functions ( @xcite ) .",
    "a real function @xmath39 is called _ operator convex _ if @xmath51 for all self - adjoint operators @xmath3 and @xmath21 and @xmath52 .",
    "this is an operator inequality , meaning that the difference of the right- and left - hand side is positive semidefinite .",
    "clearly , operator convex functions are convex , but the converse turns out to be false . for example , @xmath53 is convex , but not operator convex .",
    "given some convex function @xmath39 , it can be difficult to decide directly from the definition ( [ eqoperatorconvex ] ) whether @xmath39 is operator convex .",
    "by contrast , it turns out that there is a simple characterization of the set of _ all _ operator convex functions , which can be stated elegantly in terms of integral representations or complex analysis .",
    "this is an unexpected result , since the definition ( [ eqoperatorconvex ] ) itself involves only a linear - algebraic inequality .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to hope that something similar might happen in the case of the additivity problem , at least for special classes of ( highly symmetric ) channels : possibly the class of additive functions for a channel pair , defined by the linear - algebraic inequality  ( [ eqdef ] ) , is also simple to characterize . as we will show in this paper , this speculation turns out to be true for the werner - holevo channel in @xmath0 dimensions at least .",
    "we start by giving some simple examples .",

    "@xmath57 are additive ( for every pair of quantum channels )",

    "it is clear that scaling a function with @xmath54 does not change the location of its global maximum",

    "that is , if @xmath1 is an arbitrary quantum channel , and @xmath66 is the identity channel on some hilbert space , then every convex function @xmath33\\to{{\\mathbb r}}$ ] is additive for @xmath67 .    in particular , as is well - known , von neumann entropy and the @xmath8-rnyi entropies are additive for such channels for all @xmath9 .    *",
