    "recent high - precision observational data have confirmed that the universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "several candidates , responsible for this expansion , have been proposed in the literature , in particular , dark energy models ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) and modified gravity ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "in particular , the former models are fundamental candidates , in which a simple way to parameterize the dark energy is by an equation of state of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the spatially homogeneous pressure and @xmath4 is the dark energy density . a value of @xmath5 is required for cosmic expansion , and @xmath1 corresponds to a cosmological constant .",
    "a specific exotic form of dark energy denoted phantom energy , with @xmath6 , has also been proposed @xcite , and possesses peculiar properties , such as the violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) and the energy density increases to infinity in a finite time @xcite , at which point the size of the universe blows up in a finite time , which is known as the big rip . in this context",
    ", the violation of the nec presents us with a natural scenario for the existence of traversable wormholes , and indeed it has been shown that these exotic geometries can be supported by phantom energy @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that recent fits to supernovae , cmb and weak gravitational lensing data probably favor an evolving equation of state , with the parameter crossing the phantom divide @xmath1 @xcite .    despite the fact that the dark energy equation of state represents a spatially homogeneous cosmic fluid and",
    "is assumed not to cluster , it is possible that inhomogeneities may arise due to gravitational instabilities .",
    "more precisely , although the equation of state leading to the acceleration of the universe on large scales is an average equation of state corresponding to a background fluid , it is possible that dark energy condensates may possibly originate from density fluctuations in the cosmological background , resulting in the nucleation through the respective density perturbations .",
    "despite the fact that once in the dark energy regime the material system becomes gravitationally repulsive , we may consider the possibility of the formation of a matter system that originally obeys all the energy conditions .",
    "cosmological observations do not rule out , and in some studies favor , an evolving equation of state for the dark energy .",
    "it is therefore quite possible that what we know as dark energy today has evolved from a more benign fluid .",
    "an over - density of this fluid could in principle commence a collapse into a star which .",
    "such a model is presented in section [ sec : iiic ] .",
    "we also point out that even in the case of a dark - energy fluid , there is no definite resolution to the debate of clustering scales .",
    "this is mainly due to non - linearity , especially in the vein of dark energy interacting with ordinary fluids",
    ". it may also be possible to glean some information on the cosmological dark matter by studying certain properties of such gravitational condensates .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein for comments on these issues . ) in this context , a number of inhomogeneous solutions have been the object of analysis , such as the phantom wormholes @xcite mentioned above , dark energy stars @xcite , and other structures such as condensates supported by the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite which possibly arise from density fluctuations in the generalized chaplygin gas background , and condensed structures supported by the van der waals equation of state @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", it was also shown that the @xmath7 einstein - klein - gordon equations with a phantom scalar field possess non - singular , spherically symmetry solutions , although a stability analysis on these solutions indicates they are unstable .",
    "the dark energy star models are also a generalization of a new emerging picture for an alternative final state of gravitational collapse , namely , the gravastar ( _ _ grav__itational _ _ va__cuum _ star _ ) models .",
    "the latter proposed by mazur and mottola @xcite , has an effective phase transition at / near where the event horizon is expected to form , and the interior is replaced by a de sitter condensate .",
    "the latter is then matched to a thick layer , with an equation of state given by @xmath8 , which is in turn matched to an exterior schwarzschild solution .",
    "the issue of gravastars has been extensively analyzed in the literature , and we refer the reader to refs .",
    "the generalization of the gravastar picture is considered by matching an interior solution governed by the dark energy equation of state , @xmath9 , to an exterior schwarzschild vacuum solution at a junction interface @xcite .",
    "the dynamical stability of the transition layer was also explored , and it was found that large stability regions exist that are sufficiently close to where the event horizon is expected to form , so that it was argued that it would be difficult to distinguish the exterior geometry of the dark energy stars from an astrophysical black hole .",
    "thus , these alternative models do not possess a singularity at the origin and have no event horizon , as its rigid surface is located at a radius slightly greater than the schwarzschild radius .",
    "this restriction arises from the observed lack of energy emission due to surface collisions of infalling material in suspected black hole systems .",
    "in fact , although evidence for the existence of black holes is very convincing , a certain amount of scepticism regarding the physical reality of event horizons is still encountered , and it has been argued that despite the fact that observational data do indeed provide strong arguments in favor of event horizons , they can not fundamentally prove their existence @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , recent fits to observational data probably favor an evolving equation of state , with the dark energy parameter crossing the phantom divide @xmath1 @xcite . motivated by this fact , in a rather speculative scenario one may theoretically consider the existence of a dark energy star , with an evolving parameter starting out in the range @xmath10 , and crossing the phantom divide , @xmath1 . once in the phantom regime ,",
    "the null energy condition is violated , which physically implies that the negative radial pressure exceeds the energy density .",
    "therefore , an enormous negative pressure in the center may , in principle , imply a topology change , consequently opening up a tunnel , and converting the dark energy star into a wormhole @xcite .",
    "one may assume that the topology change may occur at approximately the planck length scales , and once created may be self - sustained as shown in ref . @xcite .",
    "in fact , the change in topology is an extremely subtle issue , as in general relativity these changes probably entail spacetime singularities .",
    "however , at the planck length scales quantum gravity effects dominate and spacetime undergoes a deep and rapid transformation in its structure , probably producing a multiply - connected quantum foam structure @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that one could imagine an absurdly advanced civilization @xcite pulling a wormhole from this submicroscopic spacetime quantum foam and enlarging it to macroscopic dimensions",
    ". however , in a more plausible scenario , the possibility that inflation might provide a natural mechanism for the enlargement of such wormholes to macroscopic size was explored @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we outline the theoretical difficulties associated to the change in topology and present a method based on the casimir energy approach .",
    "although it is still unsure if this method produces a topology change , it is extremely useful as the quasi - local energy difference calculation may reflect or measure the occurrence of a change in topology .",
    "other concepts of topology changing spacetimes have been studied , for instance : using semi - classical and morse - index methods in refs .",
    "@xcite ; higher order back - reaction terms due to fluctuations of gauge fields in the vicinity of a black hole may result in the formation of a wormhole - like object @xcite ; and more recently an approach based on a ricci flow may result in quantum wormholes @xcite .",
    "once the topology change has occurred , with the respective opening of a tunnel , then the dark energy star has been converted into wormhole supported by phantom energy . as mentioned above",
    ", it has recently been shown that traversable wormholes may , in principle , be supported by phantom energy @xcite , which apart from being used as interstellar shortcuts , may induce closed timelike curves with the associated causality violations @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting solutions were found @xcite , and by using the `` volume integral quantifier '' , it was found that these wormhole geometries are , in principle , sustained by arbitrarily small amounts of averaged null energy condition ( anec ) violating phantom energy .",
    "a complementary approach was traced out in @xcite , by considering specific choices for the distribution of the energy density threading the wormhole .",
    "recently , @xmath7 static wormhole solutions supported by two interacting phantom fields were found as well @xcite . despite the fact that traversable wormholes violate the nec in general relativity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , it has been shown that the stress energy tensor profile may satisfy the energy conditions in the throat neighborhood in dynamic wormholes ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) and in certain alternative theories to general relativity @xcite .",
    "perhaps not so appealing , one could denote these exotic geometries consisting of dark energy stars ( in the phantom regime ) and phantom wormholes as _",
    "phantom stars_. we would like to state our agnostic position relatively to the existence of dark energy stars and phantom wormholes , or for that matter of _ phantom stars_. however , it is important to understand their general properties and characteristics , and we emphasize that the presence of a dark energy fluid permeating the universe makes the study of dark energy condensates a physically relevant endeavor .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner : in section [ secii ] , we briefly review static dark energy stars , followed by a deduction of general solutions of time - dependent spacetimes . in section [ seciii ] ,",
    "specific time - dependent dark energy solutions are outlined , in particular , we present the specific cases of a constant energy density , the tolman - matese - whitman mass function solution , and a class of models with a non - zero energy flux term , which form from gravitational collapse . in section [ seciv ]",
    ", we describe the theoretical difficulties associated with changes in topology and present in some detail specific methods used in the literature , namely , a casimir energy approach involving quasi - local energy difference calculations that may reflect or measure the occurrence of a topology change .",
    "we also briefly review the morse index analysis . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief outline of the mathematical models of static and spherically symmetric dark energy stars considered in ref .",
    "consider the following time - independent line element , in curvature coordinates , representing a dark energy star @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath14 .",

    "( [ mass ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) , we have the following relationship @xmath23 there is , however , a subtle point that needs to be emphasized @xcite .",
    "the notion of dark energy is that of a spatially homogeneous cosmic fluid .",

    "( [ anisottov ] ) .",
    "in addition to this , and as mentioned in the introduction , despite the fact that the dark energy equation of state represents a spatially homogeneous cosmic fluid and is assumed not to cluster , inhomogeneities may arise due to gravitational instabilities .",
    "thus , the dark energy star geometries considered here may possibly originate from density fluctuations in the cosmological background , resulting in the nucleation through the respective density perturbations @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , specific solutions were found by considering that the energy density is positive and finite at all points in the interior of the dark energy star . in particular ,",
    "several relativistic dark energy stellar configurations were analyzed by imposing specific choices for the mass function @xmath13 , and through eq .",
    "( [ eoscondition ] ) , @xmath12 was determined , consequently providing explicit expressions for the stress - energy tensor components .",
    "this interior solution was further matched to an exterior schwarzschild vacuum solution given by @xmath25 at a junction interface @xmath26 .",
    "the schwarzschild spacetime possesses an event horizon at @xmath27 , so that to avoid the latter , the junction radius lies outside @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "the surface stresses on the thin shell are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the surface energy density and the tangential surface pressure @xcite , respectively .",
    "the overdot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath33 , which is the proper time on the junction interface , and the prime here denotes a derivative with respect to the junction surface radius @xmath26",
    ".    the dynamical stability of the transition layer @xmath26 of these dark energy stars to linearized spherically symmetric radial perturbations about static equilibrium solutions was also explored .",

    "we generalize the above static dark energy star models to time - dependent geometries .",

    "in this work , we have considered time - dependent dark energy star models , with an evolving parameter @xmath0 crossing the phantom divide , @xmath1 . in particular",
    ", we briefly reviewed static and spherically symmetric dark energy stars , and further analyzed general solutions of time - dependent spacetimes in detail .",
    "specific time - dependent solutions were extensively explored , in particular , the specific cases of a constant energy density , the tolman - matese - whitman mass function solution , and a class of models with a non - zero energy flux term , which form from gravitational collapse .",
    "once the parameter @xmath0 evolves into the phantom regime , the null energy condition is violated , which physically implies that the negative radial pressure exceeds the energy density .",
    "therefore , an enormous negative pressure at the center may , in principle , imply a topology change , consequently opening up a tunnel and converting the dark energy star into a wormhole .",
    "the theoretical difficulties and criteria for this topology change were discussed in detail , where in particular we considered a casimir energy approach involving quasi - local energy difference calculations that may reflect or measure the occurrence of a topology change . once the topology change has occurred",
    ", it is possible that the resulting wormhole structures , supported by phantom energy , be self - sustained .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , recent fits to observational data probably favor an evolving equation of state , with the dark energy parameter crossing the phantom divide @xmath1 @xcite",
    ". however , in a cosmological setting the transition into the phantom regime is physically implausible for a single scalar field @xcite , so that a possible approach would be to consider a mixture of interacting non - ideal fluids .",
    "one may consider that the time - dependent dark energy star model outlined in this work , is a simplification of this possible approach .",
    "in fact , recently , static models with two interacting phantom and ghost scalar fields were considered , and it was shown that regular solutions exist @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize the latter study to time - dependent solutions , extending the analysis considered in this work .",
    "it is interesting to note that the topology change at the center should influence the surface stresses at the thin shell , as there is a redistribution of the stress - energy tensor components of the interior solution during the change in topology .",
    "that this is so may be verified through the conservation identity given by @xmath240^{+}_{-}\\,$ ] , where @xmath241^{+}_{-}$ ] denotes the discontinuity across the surface interface @xmath170 , i.e. , @xmath241^{+}_{-}=x^{+}|_{\\sigma}-x^{-}|_{\\sigma}$ ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath242 is the surface stress - energy tensor at the junction surface @xmath170 ; @xmath168 is the unit normal @xmath243vector to @xmath170 ; and @xmath244 are the components of the holonomic basis vectors tangent to @xmath170 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "note the dependency of the conservation identity on the stress - energy tensor @xmath245 , and the right hand side of the conservation identity may also be written as @xmath246^{+}_{-}\\,$ ] , corresponds to the net discontinuity in the momentum flux @xmath247 which impinges on the shell .",
    "the conservation identity is a statement that all energy and momentum that plunges into the thin shell , gets caught by the latter and converts into conserved energy and momentum of the surface stresses of the junction .",
    "now , it may be that the topology change is sufficiently violent to disrupture the thin shell .",
    "on the other hand , one may also assume that it is sufficiently mild as not to significantly affect the stability of the surface layer .    in analogy to the case outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the possibility that inflation might provide a natural mechanism for the enlargement of wormholes to macroscopic size was explored , one could imagine that microscopic wormholes originated through a topology change , and due to the accelerated expansion of the universe , these submicroscopic constructions could naturally be grown to macroscopic dimensions .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the evolution of wormholes and ringholes embedded in a background accelerating universe driven by dark energy , was analyzed .",
    "it was shown that the wormhole s size increases by a factor proportional to the scale factor of the universe , and still increases significantly if the cosmic expansion is driven by phantom energy .",
    "the accretion of dark and phantom energy onto morris - thorne wormholes  @xcite , was further explored , and it was shown that this accretion gradually increases the wormhole throat which eventually overtakes the accelerated expansion of the universe , consequently engulfing the entire universe , and becomes infinite at a time in the future before the big rip .",
    "this process was dubbed the `` big trip '' @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of the generalized chaplygin gas , it was shown that the big rip may be avoided altogether @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for more recent details on these issues . in summary",
    ", we denote these exotic geometries consisting of dark energy stars ( in the phantom regime ) and phantom wormholes as _ phantom stars_. the final product of this topological change , namely , phantom wormholes , have far - reaching physical and cosmological implications , as in addition to being used for interstellar shortcuts , an absurdly advanced civilization may manipulate these geometries to induce closed timelike curves , consequently violating causality .",
    "relative to the topology change issue , a few words are in order .",
    "we emphasize that it is still uncertain how to obtain this change in topology , and if possible , it is riddled with technical and physical difficulties , such as the appearance of closed timelike curves .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that enormous negative pressures at the center is accompanied by a large quantum fluctuation of the metric .",
    "the geometry of spacetime undergoing quantum fluctuations does not seem to be a source of disagreement in the literature , but the question of whether or not the topology of spacetime undergoes quantum fluctuations is more subtle .",
    "in the latter , wheeler conjectured that spacetime could be subjected to a topology fluctuation at the planck scale , where spacetime undergoes a deep and rapid transformation in its structure , resulting in a spacetime quantum foam , which can be taken as a model for the quantum gravitational vacuum . nevertheless , how to realize such a foam - like space and also whether this represents the real quantum gravitational vacuum are still unknown . from the quantum point of view",
    "we can separate the problem of topology change generated by a canonical quantization approach and a functional integral quantization approach . as mentioned above",
    ", the hawking topology change theorem is thus enough to show that the topology of space can not change in canonically quantized gravity . in the feynman functional integral quantization of gravitation things",
    "are different , where an approach to spacetime foam is possible where fluctuations of topology become an important phenomenon at least at the planck scale .",
