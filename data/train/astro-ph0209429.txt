    "recent cold dark matter simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxies predict the existence of a significantly higher amount of substructure around big galaxies like the milky way @xcite , @xcite than observed in the form of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "one solution for this so - called dwarf galaxy crisis could be that the predicted subhalos have been overlooked observationally and are hidden among the population of compact high - velocity clouds ( chvc ) .",
    "blitz et al . ( 1999 ) suggested that isolated chvcs might be the leftover building blocks predicted in the cmd scenario with mean distance of about 1  mpc .",
    "braun & burton ( 1999 , 2000 ) identified an intial catalog of 65 chvcs .",
    "we here present deep optical vlt imaging and 2mass archival studies of five chvcs to test them for the presence of a stellar population .",
    "v and i band observations were obtained with fors1 at the vlt down to limiting magnitudes to be sensitive to red giant stars at distances up to @xmath0  3  mpc .",
    "the field of view , 6.8 by 6.8 arcmin , was centered on the highest column density regions ( for four chvcs ) using effelsberg radio data .",
    "we also selected all stars within a radius of 1@xmath1 from 2mass ( second incremental data release ) .",
    "these near - infrared jhk data are sensitive to old stellar populations at the typical distances of milky way dwarf spheroidal companions .",
    "the optical ccd data were searched and analyzed with daophot  ii @xcite .",
    "they are not only sensitive to old stars but would easily also reveal the presence of main sequence ( ms ) stars of a young stellar population to large distances .",
    "1 shows color magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) for four of our chvc fields .",
    "2 is the cmd of a hipass hvc .",
    "extended sources were excluded from the analysis ; the amount of unresolved background galaxies is small anyway due to the excellent seeing of the data , namely 0.65 arc sec fwhm .",
    "the cmds appear as expected for milky way halo fields .",
    "a visual inspection does not reveal any additional stellar component , e.g. a rgb or a ms at the expected distances / apparent magnitudes .",
    "a visual inspection of near - infrared 2mass cmds does not show any evidence for a spread - out rgb or agb population . for comparison , 2mass cmds of several dsph milky way companions , as well as positional plots of the stars , allow the detection of intermediate rich systems like for and scl , while umi can not be isolated from the halo stars .",
    "we performed statistical tests by adding artificially , diluted red giant branches of known dwarf galaxies , to the observed chvc cmds .",
    "we then compared these distributions to those originally observed using a kolmogorow - smirnow test .",
    "a population of about 50  rgb stars at a distance of @xmath0  0.5  mpc is at the detection limit of the vlt data ; richer systems such as those of the known dsph milky way satellites would easily be found . for details of this analysis ,",
    "see hopp , schulte - ladbeck & kerp , 2003 ( mnras , in press ) .",
    "we conclude that the observed compact clouds do not host an intrinsic stellar population .",
    "our conclusions agree with and extend those reported by simon & blitz ( 2002 ) , who did not detect stars in chvcs on processed poss scans .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac infrared science archive , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "uh acknowledges support by the sfb 375 of the dfg .",
