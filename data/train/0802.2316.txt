    "in biology , several key processes of cellular spatial organisation are driven by chemotaxis . the effective mechanism by which individual cells undergo directed motion varies among organisms .",
    "we are particularly interested here in bacterial migration , characterized by the smallness of the cells , and their ability to swim up to several orders of magnitude in the attractant concentration .",
    "several models , depending on the level of description , have been developed mathematically for the collective motion of cells @xcite . among them the kinetic model due to othmer , dunbar and alt ( oda ) @xcite , describes a population of bacteria in motion ( _ e.g .",
    "e. coli _ or _ b. subtilis _ ) @xcite in a field of chemoattractant ( a process called _ chemokinesis _ ) .",
    "these small cells are not capable of measuring any head - to - tail gradient of the chemical concentration , and to choose directly some preferred direction of motion towards high concentrated regions .",
    "therefore they develop an indirect strategy to select favourable areas , by detecting a sort of time derivative in the concentration along their pathways , and to react accordingly @xcite .",
    "in fact they undergo a jump process where free movements ( runs ) are punctuated by reorientation phenomena ( tumbles ) @xcite . for instance it is known that _",
    "e. coli _ increases the time spent in running along a favourable direction @xcite .",
    "this jump process can be described by two different informations .",
    "first cells switch the rotation of their flagella , from counter - clockwise ccw ( free runs ) to clockwise cw ( reorientation , or tumbling phase ) , and conversely .",
    "this decision is the result of a complex chain of reactions inside the cells , driven by the external concentration of the chemoattractant @xcite",
    ". then cells select a new direction .",
    "although we expect large organisms ( like the slime mold amoebae _ d. discoideum _ ) to choose directly a favourable direction , bacteria are unable to do so , and they randomly choose a new direction of motion .",
    "actually some directional persistence may influence this selection , privileging some angles better than others .",
    "however we will not consider inertia here for simplicity .     from the molecular point of view",
    ", the frequency of tumbling events is driven by a regulatory protein network made of the membrane receptor complex ( mcp ) , the switch complex located at the flagella motor , and six main proteins in between ( namely chea , chew , chey , chez , cheb and cher  more are involved in _ b. subtilis _ , but the whole picture is similar @xcite ) .",
    "this regulatory network exhibits a remarkable excitation / adaptation process @xcite .",
    "when attractant concentration increases suddenly the tumbling frequency decreases in a short time scale ( excitation ) , but increases back to the basal activity after a while ( adaptation ) .",
    "this allows bacteria to follow favorable pathways over several orders of the concentration magnitude .",
    "note that a similar adaptation process is involved in bigger organisms like _",
    "d. discoideum _ @xcite .",
    "realistic models have been proposed based on the complete regulatory network @xcite , as well as toy models capturing the key behavior ( basically made of a two species relaxing ode system @xcite ) .",
    "note that this network is also known to select positive perturbations of the chemoattractant concentration only @xcite , and to be highly sensitive to very low changes in the chemoattractant concentration @xcite .    as a drift - diffusion limit of the oda kinetic model ,",
    "one recovers the so - called keller - segel model @xcite , where diffusion and chemosensitivity coefficients can be derived from the mesoscopic description .",
    "the keller - segel model exhibits a remarkable dichotomy where cells aggregate if they are sufficient enough , and disperse if not @xcite . particularly in the two dimensional case , the total mass of cells is the key parameter which selects between these phenomena ( respectively global existence _ versus _",
    "blow - up in finite time ) .",
    "this simple alternative is depicted in the whole space @xmath0 in @xcite . in the three dimensional case",
    "however , the relevant quantity ensuring global existence is rather the @xmath1 norm of the initial cell density @xcite .",
    "therefore it is of interest to ask the question of global existence at the mesoscopic level . as far as we know , no blow - up phenomenon has been found in the oda kinetic model .",
    "the goals of this paper are the following two .",
    "first we investigate global existence theory for several kinetic models depending on the growth of the reorientation kernel with respect to the chemical . in a previous work we succesfully applied dispersion and strichartz estimates to kinetic models including delocalization effects @xcite , that can be either a time delay effect due to intracellular dynamics , or some measurement at the tip of a cell protrusion .",
    "those techniques are applied here to a class of assumptions where the reorientation kernel is actually independent of the ( inner and outer ) velocities .",
    "those assumptions are very rough from the biological point of view , but they aim to determine the critical growth of the turning kernel ensuring global existence . on the other hand we apply those ideas to a more realistic kinetic model including internal molecular variables , improving the results of @xcite .",
    "we present general assumptions for global existence that can be satisfied by the two species excitative / adptative ode system , or more generally by a complex network .",
    "we consider the following oda kinetic model for bacterial chemotaxis :    [ kinmodel ] @xmath2(t , x , v , v ' ) f(t , x , v ' ) dv ' \\nonumber \\\\ & \\qquad - \\int_{v'\\in v } t[s](t , x , v',v ) f(t , x , v ) dv ' \\ , \\quad t>0\\ , x\\in { { \\mathbb { r}}}^d   \\label{eq : oda f}\\\\ - \\delta s + s & = \\rho(t , x)=\\int_{v\\in v } f(t , x , v ) dv\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    associated with the initial condition @xmath3 .",
    "the space density of cells is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "we assume in this paper that the space dimension is @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "we assume as usual that the set @xmath7 of admissible cell velocities is bounded . the free transport operator @xmath8 describes the free runs of the bacteria which have velocity @xmath9 .",
    "on the other hand , the scattering operator in the right hand side of expresses the reorientation process ( tumbling ) occuring during the bacterial migration towards regions of high concentration in chemoattractant @xmath10 .",
    "we review below the assumptions existing in the literature concerning the reorientation kernel , in order to motivate the forthcoming work .      in a previous article @xcite , we considered mild assumptions of the type : @xmath11(t , x , v , v ' ) \\leq c \\big ( 1 + s(t , x-{\\varepsilon}v ' ) + |\\nabla s|(t , x-{\\varepsilon}v ' ) \\big ) , \\ ] ] or , @xmath12(t , x , v , v ' ) \\leq c \\big ( 1 + s(t , x+{\\varepsilon}v ) + |\\nabla s|(t , x+{\\varepsilon}v ) + |d^2s|(t , x+{\\varepsilon}v ) \\big).\\ ] ] those assumptions were studied for example in @xcite in two or three dimensions of space .    under assumption",
    ", the bacteria take the decision to reorient with the probability @xmath13 = \\int t[s](t , x , v',v)\\ dv'$ ] , and then choose a new direction randomly .",
    "therefore the turning frequency increases once cells have entered a favourable area , say ( where some delay effect due to internal dynamics is expressed by the space shifting @xmath14 ; the concentration measurement is performed at position @xmath15 by the cell with velocity @xmath16 , turning at position @xmath17 ) . intuitively , the cells increase the turning frequency to be confined in highly concentrated areas .",
    "the hypothesis is even more intuitive : cells , when they decide to turn ( due to a complex averaging over the surrounding area within a radius @xmath18 ) , simply choose a better new direction @xmath9 with higher probability .",
    "this anticipation measurement can be the result of sending protrusions in the surrounding , or considering that the cells have some finite radius with receptors located all over the membrane ( see also @xcite for a similar interpretation at the parabolic level ",
    "volume effects have also been considered at the kinetic level in @xcite ) .",
    "however this interpretation is hardly relevant for bacteria which are small cells , unable to feel gradients and to send protrusions .",
    "the gradient in assumption has to be motivated because we highlight that bacteria can not feel gradients of chemical concentration . as a matter of fact , from a homogeneity viewpoint , @xmath19 has the same weight as the time derivative @xmath20",
    ". therefore we can replace indeed by the assumption @xmath21(t , x , v , v ' ) \\leq c \\big ( 1 + s(t , x-{\\varepsilon}v ' ) + |\\partial_t s|(t , x-{\\varepsilon}v ' ) \\big ) \\ , \\ ] ] which makes sense biologically ( although a more realistic assumption is expressed for example in @xcite , see below ) . to see that @xmath19 and @xmath20 do have the same homogeneity , observe that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the bessel potential , and the flux @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 as a consequence , in the three dimensional case we have @xmath26    the dispersion lemma turned out to be a powerful tool for dealing with those assumptions ( even the second derivative of @xmath10 can be added in ) .",
    "it turns out that putting together those two hypotheses and is a much harder task ( due to the fact that we loose the benefit of the decay term in the balance law along the estimates ) .",
    "some progress in this direction was recently made in @xcite but the whole picture is not clear so far .",
    "for example in @xcite it was shown that in @xmath6 dimensions we have global existence of weak solutions if @xmath27(t , x , v , v ' ) \\lesssim   1 +   s(t , x+{\\varepsilon}v ) + s(t , x-{\\varepsilon}v ' ) + { \\left|\\nabla s(t , x+{\\varepsilon}v)\\right| } + { \\left|\\nabla s(t , x-{\\varepsilon}v')\\right|},\\ ] ] provided that the initial data are small in the critical space @xmath1 .",
    "if is strengthened by dropping the last term , then a global existence result was established without a smallness assumption on the initial data .",
    "the proofs use the dispersion and strichartz estimates of @xcite and rely on the delocalization effects induced by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "interestingly the fact that some directed motion emerges from turning kernels which resemble to assumptions , or  as pointed out by the diffusion limit  seems to involve a completely different mechanism from the following commonly described behaviour in _",
    "e. coli_.      as opposed to the previous set of hypothesis , it is commonly accepted that bacteria increase the time spent in running in a favourable direction @xcite .",
    "that is , the turning kernel is expected to decrease as the chemical concentration increases along the cell s trajectory , like @xmath30(v , v ' ) = t_0 + \\psi(s_t + v'\\cdot \\nabla s)\\ , \\label{eq : directional derivative}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is nonnegative and decreasing , and @xmath32 denotes the directional derivative along the free run before turning ( see @xcite , @xcite where this hypothesis is injected in a model for _",
    "d. discoideum _ self - organization , and its drift - diffusion limit is derived ) .",
    "one may think of @xmath31 to be : @xmath33 if @xmath34 and @xmath35 if @xmath36 for instance .",
    "actually , in @xcite the authors explicit two behaviour caricatures , where cells might `` perfectly avoid going in wrong directions '' , or `` perfectly follow good directions '' .",
    "the latter is stressed out there and leads the system to regular solutions , intuitively , whereas the former might develop singularities where cells aggregate .",
    "the above mechanism is also part of more complex models including internal variables ( which is reviewed and analysed further below ) .",
    "in fact some molecular concentration denoted by @xmath37 ( standing for the phosphorylated chey - p ) which induces a tumbling behavior , is actually reduced under attractant binding to the membrane receptor ( excitation phase ) .",
    "the chemical chain of reactions is in fact inhibited under activation of the membrane complex receptor . on the contrary ,",
    "expression of a repellent activates this internal network , favouring tumbling .",
    "global existence theory for such a class of models has been discussed in @xcite for the one dimensional case .",
    "complex models of bacterial motility include a cascade of chemical reactions .",
    "this chain of activator / inhibitor reactions links the evaluation of the chemical concentration by the membrane receptors to the rotational switch of the flagella , inducing or inhibiting the tumbling phase .",
    "several works propose a chemical network describing this complexity @xcite .",
    "in particular , the global short term excitation / mid term adaptation is crucial for the cells to crawl up across levels of magnitude of the chemical concentration .",
    "caricatures of such an excitation / adaptation process are depicted in @xcite for instance .",
    "however we will keep in this paper the necessary abstract level required for our purpose ( for an illustrative example , see section [ sec : internal ] ) .    in the following",
    ", @xmath38 denotes the whole internal state of the cells , which can correspond to huge data of molecular concentrations in the chemical network ( in fact @xmath39 in the caricatural excitating / adaptating system ) . in accordance with previous notations",
    ", @xmath40 denotes the cell density at position @xmath17 , velocity @xmath9 , and with internal state @xmath37 . as before , @xmath41 is the cell density in position@xmath42velocity space . on the other hand",
    "we introduce @xmath43 , and as usual @xmath44 .",
    "the chemical potential is given by a mean - field equation @xmath45 .",
    "but this could be extended to a more realistic influence of the internal state on the chemical secretion ( as it is in @xcite ) @xmath46 under suitable assumptions on the weight @xmath47 .",
    "the dynamic inside an individual cell is driven by an ode system representing the protein network in an abstract way : @xmath48 the cell master equation describing the run and tumble processes , and the chemical potential equation are respectively :    [ kinmodel_y intro ] @xmath49    the turning kernel @xmath50 can be decomposed in this context as product between a turning frequency @xmath51 $ ] , depending on the internal state only , and a reorientation @xmath52 which may describe some persistence in the choice of a new direction with respect to the old one . without loss of generality here",
    "we assume that @xmath52 is constant and renormalized as being @xmath53 .",
    "it is worth noticing that this realistic kinetic model may contain enormous informations on the microscopic cell biology , and links different scales of description , because we eventually end up with a cell population @xmath4 .    as a partial conclusion",
    ", we observe that several scenarios with different underlying kinds of hypotheses , drive the system to positive chemotaxis ( at least considering the formal drift - diffusion limit of those ) .      in this paper",
    "we investigate the critical growth of the turning kernel in terms of space norms of the chemical which ensures the global existence for the kinetic model .",
    "in particular we consider control on the turning kernel without any dependence upon the velocity variables , that is with some abuse of notations : @xmath21(t , x , v , v ' ) \\leq t[s](t , x)\\ , \\ ] ] under suitable conditions on the growth of @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "we exhibit examples in 2d and 3d , restricting ourselves to some @xmath55 norms of the chemical ( and not of its gradient for instance ) for which our method appears to be borderline .",
    "in particular , it is natural to ask ( see section 3 of @xcite and the concluding remarks in @xcite ) whether global existence can be established under a hypothesis of the form @xmath56(t , x , v , v ' ) \\leq c\\big ( 1 + { \\left\\| s(t,\\cdot ) \\right\\|_{l^{\\infty}({{\\mathbb { r}}}^d)}}^{\\alpha}\\big)\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath57 .",
    "consider first the case of dimension @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite we can ask whether the turning kernel can grow exponentially : @xmath58(t , x , v , v ' ) \\leq c\\left ( 1 + \\exp\\left[{\\left\\| s(t,\\cdot ) \\right\\|_{l^{\\infty}({{\\mathbb { r}}}^2)}}^{\\beta}\\right ] \\right ) .\\ ] ] we will show that this is actually possible : if @xmath59 then we have global existence for large data ; if @xmath60 we have global existence for initial data of small mass .",
