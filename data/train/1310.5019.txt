    "direct photons play an important role as electromagnetic probes for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) which occurs during ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . since photons interact only electromagnetically with the surrounding hadronic medium their mean free path is much larger than the spatial extension of the qgp . for that reason ,",
    "they leave it almost undisturbed once they have been produced and therefore provide a direct insight into all stages of the collision . in this context , it is of particular interest how non - equilibrium effects such as the finite lifetime of the qgp affect the resulting photon emission .",
    "earlier investigations on this question @xcite found that this finite lifetime gives rise to contributions from first - order qed processes , i.e. , processes linear in the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath0 , which are kinematically forbidden in thermal equilibrium .",
    "moreover , the photon spectrum resulting from these processes flattened into a power - law decay for photon energies @xmath1 ( @xmath2 with @xmath3 denoting the three - momentum of the emitted photon ) , which would imply that in this domain the first - order contributions dominate over leading - order thermal contributions . the latter are linear in the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath0 , and the strong coupling constant , @xmath4 , in each case and thus of overall second order .",
    "on the other hand , the investigations in @xcite were accompanied by two serious artifacts .",
    "first , the photon number density contained a divergent contribution from the vacuum polarization for a given photon energy , @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the photon number density arising from the remaining contributions scaled as @xmath6 in the ultraviolet ( uv ) domain .",
    "this implies that the total number density and the total energy density of the emitted photons are logarithmically and linearly divergent , respectively .",
    "recently , we have followed two other approaches in order to handle these problems in a consistent manner . in the first approach @xcite ,",
    "we have pursued a model description in which we have simulated the finite lifetime of the qgp by introducing time dependent quark / antiquark occupation numbers in the photon self - energy .",
    "this procedure allows for a consistent renormalization of the divergent contribution from the vacuum polarization .",
    "it does , however , not lead to a uv integrable photon number density for the general case .",
    "at first we had suspected that this shortcoming results from a violation of the ward - takahashi identities within the model description @xcite .",
    "for that reason , we have also pursued a second approach @xcite , where we have modeled the creation of the qgp by a yukawa - like source term in the qed - lagrangian coupling the quarks and antiquarks to a purely time dependent , scalar background field .",
    "this effectively assigns the quarks and antiquarks a time dependent mass , which is consistent with the ward - takahashi identities .",
    "we have again restricted ourselves to first - order and thus purely non - equilibrium qed processes .",
    "these are kinematically possible in this case since the quarks and antiquarks obtain additional energy by the coupling to the time dependent background field .",
    "similar investigations have been performed in @xcite on electron - positron pair annihilation into a single photon in the presence of a strong laser field . there",
    "the preceding pair creation ( and the subsequent annihilation ) has been induced by a time dependent electromagnetic background field ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another crucial difference to the approaches in @xcite has been the consideration of the photon number density not at finite times , but for free asymptotic states employing the standard gell - man and low switching of the interaction hamiltonian . through this procedure ,",
    "the photon number density is not plagued by the aforementioned unphysical contribution from the vacuum polarization anymore and , furthermore , has been rendered uv integrable for suitable mass parameterizations , @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , our investigations have shown that the photon number density indeed has to be considered for free asymptotic states in order to obtain such physically reasonable results . in this context , we have seen that a consistent definition of the photon number density is actually only possible for such free asymptotic states , whereas a similar interpretation of the respective expression is usually not justified at finite times , @xmath8 .",
    "such a conceptual problem also occurs if the electromagnetic interaction is only switched on from @xmath9 but not off again for @xmath10 , which has been suggested in @xcite in order to implement initial correlations at some @xmath11 developing from an uncorrelated initial state at @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the results from @xcite raise the question whether the artifacts encountered in @xcite result from an inconsistent definition of the ` photon number density ' at finite times and whether they are removed if this quantity is considered for free asymptotic states instead .",
    "accordingly , in this work we revisit the previous approach @xcite .",
    "this means that we again simulate the time - evolution of the qgp during a heavy - ion collision by introducing strongly time dependent quark / antiquark occupation numbers in the photon self - energy , but we consider photon number density not at finite times , but for free asymptotic states .",
    "hence , we adhere to our principle approach from @xcite but consider an alternative description for our time dependent emitting system .",
    "we shall demonstrate that in direct analogy to @xcite , this procedure again eliminates a potential unphysical contribution from the vacuum polarization .",
    "moreover , it leads to a uv integrable photon number density if the time evolution of the quark / antiquark occupation numbers in the photon self - energy is described in a physically reasonable manner , i.e. , if it is taken into account that these occupation numbers are populated over a finite interval of time . in this context",
    ", we emphasize again that considering the photon number density for free asymptotic states is , indeed , crucial to obtain such physically reasonable results and that the artifacts encountered in @xcite and still partly in @xcite would reappear if this quantity were considered at finite times .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we provide a detailed description of our ( revised ) model approach on first - order photon production from a qgp .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate how we simulate the time evolution of the qgp by introducing fastly populating , time dependent quark / antiquark occupation numbers in the photon self - energy and how our asymptotic description eliminates a possible unphysical contribution from the vacuum polarization .",
    "after that , we present our numerical investigations in section [ sec : numint ] .",
    "we show that in this present setting , our description also leads to a uv integrable photon number density .",
    "there we also provide detailed considerations on the dependence of the photon number density on the time scale , @xmath12 , over which the quark / antiquark occupation numbers are assumed to build up",
    ". then we compare our results to leading - order thermal photon emission in section [ sec : thermcomp ] . in section [ sec : aspt ] , we again highlight the necessity to consider the photon number density for free asymptotic states before we finish with a summary and an outlook to future investigations in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "technical details are given in appendix [ sec : appa ] .",
    "before we start with our numerical investigations , we provide a more extensive description of our model approach than given in @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the photon number density for a homogeneous , but non - stationary emitting system of deconfined quarks and antiquarks . at first order in @xmath0 ,",
    "this quantity is given by @xmath13 here @xmath14 denotes the transverse part of the photon self - energy , i.e. , @xmath15 @xmath16 is the photon tensor reading @xmath17 where the sum runs over all physical ( transverse ) polarizations .",

    "the principal reason why the contributions form initial nucleon - nucleon scatterings and jet - medium interactions dominate over the pure medium contributions from the qgp and the subsequent hadronic phase in the uv domain is that the photon spectra from the former two sources flatten into a power - law decay , whereas those from the latter feature an exponential decay .",

    "* on the other hand , they can also be violated indirectly by considering the ` photon number density ' at finite times and using an inadequate definition of this quantity .",

    "the reason is that the definition of the photon number density considered therein would only allow for an accordant interpretation if the electromagnetic interaction was switched off at the point of time , @xmath8 , at which said quantity is considered . by means of such a switching , however , an effective violation of the ward - takahashi identities , which otherwise would be fulfilled , reoccurs . in this context",
    "it is important to point out that an adequate definition of a transient particle number density is generally impossible altogether for fundamental reasons except in some special settings @xcite",

    "<S> direct photons play an important role as electromagnetic probes from the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) which occurs during ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . in this context , it is of particular interest how the finite lifetime of the qgp affects the resulting photon production . </S>",
    "<S> earlier investigations on this question were accompanied by a divergent contribution from the vacuum polarization and by the remaining contributions not being integrable in the ultraviolet ( uv ) domain . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we provide a different approach in which we do not consider the photon number density at finite times , but for free asymptotic states obtained by switching the electromagnetic interaction according to the gell - mann and low theorem . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure eliminates a possible unphysical contribution from the vacuum polarization and , moreover , renders the photon number density uv integrable . </S>",
    "<S> it is emphasized that the consideration of free asymptotic states is , indeed , crucial to obtain such physically reasonable results . </S>"
