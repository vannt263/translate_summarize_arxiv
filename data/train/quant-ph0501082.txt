    "quantum entanglement is an intriguing property of composite systems .",
    "it refers to the inseparable correlations stronger than all classical counterparts .",
    "recent studies indicate that entanglement is not only of interest to the interpretation of the foundations of quantum mechanics , but also represents a useful resource for quantum computation and quantum communication .",
    "inseparable correlations such as entanglement also exist in systems of identical particles , e.g. electrons in quantum dots @xcite , atoms in a bose - einstein condensate @xcite , and electrons in quantum hall liquids @xcite . even for the widely used parametric down conversion process",
    ", a complete treatment must take into account the indistinguishability of the down converted photons .",
    "although the study of entanglement has had a long history in systems of distinguishable particles , only recently did the entanglement properties in a system of identical particles begin to attract much attention @xcite .",
    "quantum correlation among identical particles was noted by schliemann _",
    "_ @xcite and they discussed the entanglement in a two - fermion system .",
    "it was argued that the separability of a two fermion state should be defined in terms of whether or not that state can be expressed in terms of a sum of single slater determinants @xcite .",
    "more generally , a two fermion pure state can always be expressed in the following standard form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the orthonormal basis states of a single particle ( fermion ) .",
    "the case of two bosons were considered independently by pakauskas and you @xcite and li _ et al .",
    "they found a similar standard form for two - identical bosons , namely , the wave functions of two bosons can always be written in the following form @xmath6 where @xmath7 forms an orthonormal basis in the single particle ( boson ) space .",
    "the above two results are in fact simple extensions of the well known result for two distinguishable particles ; that an arbitrary pure state can be described in terms of the famous schmidt decomposition @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 and @xmath10 . a natural generalization of the schmidt decomposition to @xmath11 particles is @xmath12 with the sub - indices @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) for the @xmath13-th ( @xmath14-th ) particle , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) the @xmath15-th ( @xmath16-th ) basis vector .",
    "however , even for three two - state particles or three qubits with the hilbert space @xmath17 , the above schmidt decomposition does not exist , pointing to a truly challenging prospect for characterizing the multi - particle entanglement .    for a multi - particle system ,",
    "the characterization of its entanglement for a pure state usually starts with certain canonical form of its wave function . in this study",

    "thus , we conclude that for w - type states the spin squeezing is drastically different from the pairwise quantum entanglement . for states of @xmath47 ,",

    "a similar procedure can be applied to the coefficient of state @xmath30 .",
    "therefore we complete our proof of proposition 1 .",
