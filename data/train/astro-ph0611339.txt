    "the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has provided overwhelming evidence for the power of a space - based platform for optical and near - infrared ( nir ) astronomical observations @xcite . in particular , access to diffraction limited imaging , stable observing conditions , and low background levels have revolutionized our understanding of the faint and distant universe .",
    "space - science instruments are evolving from the initial hst instruments that provided narrow - field observations to large scale survey instruments capable of providing hst quality ( or better ) data across large regions of the sky .",
    "the hst began this trend toward large - scale surveys with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in 2002 @xcite .",
    "the acs has enabled a series of relatively wide - field surveys , such as the goods , gems , and cosmos surveys , however even the largest of these reaches only a few square degrees .",
    "these surveys provide deep , high - resolution imaging , but a limited picture of the statistical properties of the objects they detect , and little information about the large scale distribution of these objects . for comparison ,",
    "large ground based surveys , such as the sdss ( 10,000 square degrees ) provide precise statistical information with lower resolution .",
    "@xcite    future space - science instruments will combine high - resolution with wide - field imaging to provide new data sets for cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "wide - field imaging missions have been proposed to study such diverse topics as planets ( kepler ) @xcite , microlensing ( gest ) @xcite , and dark energy ( e.g. snap @xcite and destiny @xcite ) .",
    "the central science goals for most of these missions depend on the ability to make precise photometric measurements in imaging mode .",
    "for example , kepler will monitor the brightness of about @xmath0 stars , watching for the very slight dimming ( @xmath1 ) associated with planetary transits .",
    "snap will achieve relative distance measurements with a smaller than @xmath2 uncertainty by comparing the restframe b and v magnitudes of type ia supernovae .    to achieve wide - field imaging and high resolution at an affordable cost ,",
    "many modern instruments operate in a critically sampled , or undersampled mode .",
    "such observations require a detailed understanding of the detector response .",
    "large scale inter - pixel variations in detector response are characterized by a variety of well established flat - fielding methods",
    ". however , no such methods exist for small scale intra - pixel sensitivity variations , which introduce uncertainties in the conversion between the detected signal and incident light .",
    "to study the intra - pixel response in nir sensors , an automated spot projection system has been developed .",
    "this system , the `` spot - o - matic , '' is part of the university of michigan near infrared detector testing facility .",
    "it is designed to measure one - dimensional and two - dimensional sub - pixel response profiles in large format nir focal plane arrays ( fpas ) which are used in wide - field surveys .",
    "typical pixel sizesm@xmath3 are now under development . ] for such detectors are approximately @xmath4m@xmath3 . the spot - o - matic performs sub - pixel response measurements by step - scanning a stable , micron - sized spot across a small region of the detector , and recording the detector s response at each spot position .",
    "a computer controlled @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 stage allows for large high - resolution step - scans of @xmath8 to @xmath9 pixels with sub - micron motion control .",
    "as intra - pixel sensitivity variations were expected to be at the few percent level , the system was designed to achieve a relative accuracy of better than @xmath10 .",
    "the spot - o - matic has achieved this accuracy goal in measuring the pixel response function ( prf ) for the commercially - produced large format nir sensors listed in table  [ table : device - list ] .",
    "[ htbp ]        the design for the spot - o - matic is based on the concept of a pinhole projector for visible light that was developed to measure diffusion in charge coupled devices ( ccds ) @xcite .",
    "this concept has been extended to an instrument that operates both at visible and nir wavelengths .",
    "the principle optical components of the instrument are outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : spot - o - matic - optics ] .",
    "nir detectors designed for low background applications must be cooled to limit the generation of thermal carriers ( dark current ) to acceptable values .",
    "therefore , the spot - o - matic utilizes a long working distance objective to project a spot onto a nir detector which is mounted inside a cryogenic dewar ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the spot - o - matic light source is a 50w qth ( quartz - tungsten - halogen ) lamp ( ushio brl 12v50w ) powered by a spectra physics power supply ( model no",
    ".  69931 ) and operated in constant current mode .",
    "this mode of operation provides better than @xmath10 stability and ensures that light intensity variations are accurately decoupled from any detector response variations .",
    "the lamp is enclosed in a photomax housing ( spectra physics model no .",
    "60100 ) with an elliptical reflector that focuses the light into a liquid light guide .",
    "this guide directs the light into an optical assembly , where it is divided by a @xmath11 beam splitter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spot - o - matic - optics ] ) .",
    "the weaker beam is directed to a silicon feedback diode , while the stronger beam passes first through a narrow bandpass filter and then through a diffuser before it illuminates the pinhole .",
    "light passing through the pinhole travels through a nir tube lens before it is focused by a long working distance nir microscope objective , through the dewar window , onto a cold sensor ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spot - o - matic - optics ] ) .",
    "the demagnification of the pinhole image is set by the distance of the pinhole from the microscope objective .",
    "the results presented here use a @xmath12 m pinhole and a @xmath13 demagnification . with this configuration ,",
    "the spot point spread function ( psf ) is nearly diffraction limited at wavelengths above @xmath14 nm .",
    "the focusing microscope objective is a mitutoyo infinity - corrected long working distance objective , mm , with a numerical aperture ( na ) of 0.26 ] chromatically corrected from @xmath15 nm to @xmath16 nm for both nir and visible operation .",
    "spot sizes as small as @xmath17 m have been achieved at a wavelength of @xmath18 nm . spot sizes above the diffraction limit can be produced by varying the pinhole aperture and the demagnification .",
    "a set of narrow - bandpass filters ( @xmath19 nm fwhm ) allows for stable near - monochromatic sampling of the spectral sensitivity range of the tested detectors .",
    "the spot - o - matic optics are mounted on an nai ( national aperture inc . )",

    "axis is the focus axis , @xmath5 and @xmath6 scan the projected spot across detector the detector s columns and rows . ]",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes have a minimum step size of @xmath20 m , with a positioning error of less than @xmath21 m per @xmath22 cm of linear travel , and a repeatability of @xmath23 m . to ensure a reproducible focus , the @xmath7 axis uses a high - resolution linear encoder with a step size of @xmath24 nm .",
    "this provides an accurate reading of the stage position , and avoids gear - head backlash when changing the direction of travel .",
    "the stage is controlled by an nai motion mc-4sa servo amplifier system .",
    "custom labview interfaces automate the test procedures .",
    "the spot - o - matic assembly is mounted on an optical table inside a dark enclosure to reduce the background photon flux .",
    "the tested sensors have a cutoff wavelength between @xmath25 nm and @xmath26 nm and are thus sensitive to a large background ( a few thousand photons / pixel / second ) of thermal radiation from the optics and the walls of the dark enclosure at room temperature ( @xmath27k ) . to reduce the thermal photon background , an effort was made to place a cold narrow - band filter inside the dewar ; however , due to space constraints",
    "a filter could not be accommodated .",
    "thus the intensity of the projected spot was raised to a level at which the measurement was no longer dominated by thermal radiation . for typical spot intensities and room temperature background fluxes , the statistical uncertainty limit due to shot noise on the source plus background photons",
    "is less than @xmath10 .      in order to measure intra - pixel responses ,",
    "the spot - o - matic is designed to produce spots much smaller than typical nir pixels .",
    "for the measurements reported here , scans were performed at wavelengths of @xmath18 nm and @xmath25 nm . these two wavelengths were chosen to probe both the short and long wavelength response of the detectors .",
    "@xmath25 nm was chosen because the long wavelength cutoff of the ingaas detector , which is @xmath28 m at room temperature , drops to @xmath29 m at @xmath30k due to an increased bandgap energy at lower temperatures .",
    "@xmath18 nm is near the approximately @xmath31 nm cutoff of those detectors that do not have the substrate removed .",

    "the image location is found by focusing the beam in the @xmath7 direction to minimize the spot size .",
    "the unobscured beam typically extends over a few hundred pixels ]    the beam profile is measured using the foucault knife - edge technique , a procedure commonly used to determine the spatial profiles of images from point sources @xcite . the transmitted beam intensity is recorded as a spot is stepped across a razor blade mounted @xmath32 mm above the detector surface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : knife - edge ] .",
    "since the unobscured beam covers a few hundred pixels , sensitivity variations within pixels do not affect the measurement .",
    "+       figure [ fig : knife - edge - scans ] shows the results from a series of knife - edge scans performed at wavelengths of @xmath18 nm and @xmath25 nm .",

    "note the small `` shoulder '' on the left side of each lsf .",

    "a gaussian function provides an excellent fit to the central spot profile , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : knife - edge - scans ] ( the bottom panels ) . at a wavelength of @xmath18 nm",
    ", the lsf has a fitted width of @xmath33 m , while at @xmath25 nm the width has increased to @xmath34 m .",
    "the expected widths of each lsf can be calculated by convolving the airy disk with the demagnified geometric pinhole image .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the airy disk is given by @xmath35 where the numerical aperture , na , is 0.26 for the spot - o - matic optics .",
    "the root mean squared ( rms ) width of a circular spot is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 m is the diameter of the demagnified pinhole image in the absence of diffraction .",
    "adding the two components in quadrature yields an expected spot size of @xmath38 m at a wavelength of @xmath18 nm and @xmath39 m at @xmath25 nm .",
    "these predictions are in excellent agreement with the measured values .      to focus the spot onto the detector surface , a virtual knife - edge procedure is employed .",
    "this method is analogous to the foucault knife - edge procedure , but does not use a razor blade to obstruct the beam . instead , a sub - pixel size spot is step - scanned across the center of an individual pixel while the signal in that pixel is recorded .",
    "the edge of the pixel serves as the edge of the razor blade in the foucault knife - edge scan , and best focus is achieved at minimum edge width .",
    "although diffusion between pixels widens the edge , it remains constant and is independent of the spot size .",

    "capacitive coupling is a deterministic process by which pixels share charge after photon collection .",
    "this is in contrast to charge diffusion which occurs prior to charge collection @xcite and is stochastic .",
    "once the best focus is established , a small region of pixels ( approximately @xmath42 pixels ) is step - scanned in two dimensions to measure pixel response .",
    "the spot is scanned repeatedly across the detector in the @xmath5 direction with incremental steps of @xmath21 m to @xmath43 m in the @xmath6 direction between scans .",

    "[ fig:2d - virtual - knife - edge - scans ] is nearly symmetric .",
    "lateral charge diffusion , capacitive coupling , as well as a contribution from the higher order rings of the airy disk produce a signal in the measured pixel even when the spot is projected onto a neighbor pixel .",
    "diffraction accounts for only a small portion of the signal measured outside the illuminated pixel : when a spot ( with a wavelength of @xmath18 nm ) is centered in a pixel , approximately @xmath2 of the light is diffracted onto the eight surrounding pixels .",
    "almost all of the signal measured outside the illuminated pixel is due to charge diffusion and capacitive coupling between the pixels .",
    "charge diffusion increases the edge transition s rms width to @xmath44 m , compared to @xmath45 m obtained from the foucault knife - edge scan .",
    "extraction of the prf requires unfolding of the measured pixel response from the measured point spread function of the projected spot ( see section  [ sub : deconv ] ) .",

    "the data further suggests that photoelectrons generated at pixel boundaries are collected with close to unit efficiency .",
    "this confirms that lateral charge diffusion or capacitive coupling @xcite , rather than inefficient charge collection , is the dominant source of the intra - pixel variation in this device .",
    "in addition , the tails in the prf extend far into the neighboring pixel , a clear sign of capacitive charge sharing .",

    "are then determined by fitting this model to the raw data .",
    "the fitting procedure starts with a two parameter ( width and position ) boxcar response functionm ) , however , allowing this parameter to vary during the fitting procedure showed no significant impact on either the best fit value for the diffusion or the capacitive coupling . ] .",
    "the boxcar is first convolved with a gaussian function with @xmath53 m , as measured using the foucault knife - edge scanning procedure .",
    "the result is then convolved with a diffusion term proportional to the hyperbolic secant , given as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the diffusion length and @xmath56 is the distance of the collected charge from the location of the electron - hole pair .",
    "finally , capacitive coupling is added to the model by assuming a grid of identical pixels with a coupling coefficient @xmath57 . in this case , each pixel gains or loses a charge of @xmath57 times the difference between the pixel s value and that of each of its four neighbors .",

    "note that the pixel response includes only diffusion and capacitive coupling convolved with a boxcar response function .",
    "the best fit to the raw one - dimensional scan data , which also includes the spot - o - matic psf , is shown in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : convolution ] . the pixel responses with and without the spot psf included are nearly indistinguishable from each other .",
