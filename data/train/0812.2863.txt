    "for practical reasons , many covariance matrices appearing in fields of science are not finite perturbations of the identity matrix .",

    "since the construction is identical to that in @xcite and @xcite , we shall not repeat the details here and refer the readers to these 2 papers .",

    "the the universality result theorem [ thm : main2 ] can now be proven by using the asymptotics of the multiple laguerre polynomials obtained in the last section .",
    "the proof is the same as the ones in section 9 of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and we shall leave the readers to verify the details .",
    "this paper complements the results obtained in our earlier paper @xcite on the universality of complex wishart ensembles 2 with distinct eigenvalues and the number of each eigenvalue becomes large as the size of the ensemble goes to infinity . by using results in the stieltjes transform of the limiting eigenvalue distribution , we were able to overcome difficulties in determining the sheet structure of the riemann surface ( [ eq : curve20 ] ) .",
    "this , together with an analysis of the topology of the zero set of a function @xmath108 ( [ eq : hx ] ) , enables us to apply the deift - zhou steepest descent method to obtain asymptotic formula for the eigenvalue correlation function .",
    "together with @xcite , we showed that unless the discriminant of the polynomial ( [ eq : quartic1 ] ) is zero , the local eigenvalue statistics are given by the sine - kernel ( [ eq : bulk ] ) in the bulk and the airy kernel ( [ eq : edge ] ) in the edge of the spectrum .",
    "we have also shown that the largest eigenvalue is distributed according to the tracy - widom distribution ( [ eq : tw ] ) .",
    "when the discriminant @xmath45 of ( [ eq : quartic1 ] ) becomes zero , the ensemble goes through a phase transition in which the support of the limiting eigenvalue density changes from 1 interval to 2 intervals . this phase transition can be studied by the method developed in @xcite and the eigenvalue correlation function will be given by the pearcey kernel near the critical point of the spectrum , the point where the support is splitting .",
    "the use of stieltjes transform to provide a riemann surface needed for the implementation of the riemann - hilbert analysis can be generalized to cases where the covariance matrix has more than 2 distinct eigenvalues .",
