    "the temperature behavior of the light - quark vector current correlator in the framework of thermal qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) was first discussed in @xcite , and later reanalyzed by others @xcite mostly using laplace transform sum rules .",
    "inconsistent results from the use of these sum rules were first pointed out in @xcite-@xcite . a better understanding of the qcdsr method @xcite , both at zero and at finite temperature , and in particular the use of cauchy s theorem in the complex energy plane to formulate quark - hadron duality , has led to a preference of finite energy qcdsr ( fesr ) over the laplace transform counterparts . in fact ,",
    "modern determinations of the qcd strong coupling @xcite and quark masses @xcite , as well as thermal properties of hadrons @xcite-@xcite are now mostly done in the framework of fesr .",
    "regarding the latter , the emerging picture is as follows . a key parameter signaling quark - gluon deconfinement is the squared energy threshold , @xmath2 , above which the hadronic spectral function is well approximated by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , as first proposed in @xcite .",
    "explicit determinations of @xmath2 in several light- and heavy - light - quark systems @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite find this parameter to decrease with increasing temperature , vanishing at a critical value @xmath3 interpreted as the deconfinement temperature .",
    "two other hadronic parameters , the coupling and the width , also behave as expected from a deconfinement scenario , i.e. the coupling decreases and the width increases with increasing temperature . a monotonically increasing hadronic width , interpreted as resonance absorption in a hot plasma , was proposed long ago as a clear signal of deconfinement @xcite , and used to predict resonance broadening in dimuon production in high energy nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "this effect was later confirmed by several experiments @xcite .",
    "an exception to the above behaviour has been found for the heavy - heavy - quark states @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , which appear to survive above @xmath7 @xcite in agreement with lattice qcd results @xcite .",
    "it should be recalled that the conceptual interpretation of a hadronic width at finite temperature is different from that at @xmath8 .",
    "while in the latter case the width is entirely related to decay into allowed hadronic channels , at @xmath9 particles hadronically stable at @xmath8 develop a width due to the emergence of scattering channels which modify the interaction rate .",
    "this has been demonstrated explicitly in hadronic models , e.g. the linear sigma model @xcite , chiral perturbation theory @xcite , and others , as well as in qcd sum rules @xcite , where e.g. the pion and the nucleon develop a width which increases monotonically with temperature .",
    "in other words , an increasing width signals an increase in the interaction probability , rather than only a decrease in a decay rate .",
    "+ regarding the hadron mass , its temperature behavior is hardly of any interest in the context of the deconfinement transition . in fact",
    ", the mass is nothing but the real part of the pole of the hadron propagator in the complex squared energy plane .",
    "whether the pole moves up or down with increasing @xmath10 does not provide , in itself , any information regarding deconfinement .",
    "it is the imaginary part of the hadron propagator , i.e. the hadronic width , which signals deconfinement if it grows with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "one could picture the extreme situation of the mass decreasing and vanishing at some @xmath11 .",
    "if this behavior is not accompanied by an increasing width then the hadron would still be present in the spectral function at @xmath12 .",
    "explicit determinations of the temperature dependence of hadron masses indicate a mild change with temperature , increasing or decreasing slightly depending on the channel .",
    "+ in this paper we consider the first three thermal fesr for the vector current correlator to find the behavior of @xmath2 and the @xmath0-meson parameters , as well as the dimension @xmath13 gluon condensate , and the @xmath14 four - quark condensate entering the operator product expansion ( ope ) in qcd .",
    "this follows a recent analysis @xcite of the axial - vector channel with a much improved hadronic spectral function , involving not only the pion pole as in @xcite , @xcite but also the @xmath15 resonance .",
    "since the pion pole in this channel is related to the quark condensate , a connection can be established between chiral - symmetry restoration and deconfinement . given the absence of a pole in the vector channel , it is not a - priori obvious that results in this case should be similar to those in the axial - vector channel , where the thermal quark condensate mostly drives the behaviour of @xmath2 .",
    "another difference between axial - vector and vector channels is the presence in the latter of a space - like cut in the complex energy plane , interpreted as due to the scattering of the vector current off pions in the hot plasma @xcite .",
    "this term is of higher order ( two - loop ) in the axial - vector channel , and thus negligible @xcite , @xcite-@xcite . on the other hand , pqcd is chiral symmetric ( in the chiral limit ) , and so is the leading dimension @xmath13 term in the ope .",
    "additional motivation for reexamining the thermal vector current correlator using fesr , and modern information , is to determine the @xmath10-dependence of the @xmath0-meson width entirely from qcd , as opposed to earlier work based on current algebra @xcite .",
    "this is important in connection with current experiments on dimuon production in high energy nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the light - quark vector current correlator at @xmath8 is defined as @xmath16 & = & ( -g_{\\mu\\nu}\\ , q^2 + q_\\mu q_\\nu ) \\ , \\pi(q^2 )   \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 $ ] is the ( electric charge neutral ) conserved vector current in the chiral limit , and @xmath18 is the four - momentum carried by the current .",
    "the function @xmath19 in pqcd is normalized as @xmath20,\\ ] ] where radiative corrections are currently known up to five - loop order , i.e. @xmath21 . the qcd fesr rest on two pillars @xcite , ( i ) the operator product expansion ( ope ) of current correlators at short distances beyond perturbation theory , and ( ii ) cauchy s theorem in the complex squared energy plane , which relates the ( hadronic ) discontinuity across the cut on the real semi - axis with the integral around a contour of radius @xmath22 where the ope is expected to be valid .",
    "the latter is usually referred to as quark - hadron duality .",
    "this leads to the fesr @xmath23 & - & \\frac{s_0^n}{n } \\left[1+{\\mathcal{o}}(\\alpha_s)\\right ] \\;\\ ; ( n=1,2,\\cdots ) \\;,\\label{fesr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the leading order vacuum condensates in the chiral limit are the dimension @xmath13 gluon condensate @xmath24 and the dimension @xmath14 four - quark condensate @xmath25 . \\label{c6}\\ ] ] the radiative corrections in eq.(3 ) are known up to five - loop order , i.e. @xmath21 , and they will be used at @xmath8 to normalize the fesr . + under the extreme approximation of vacuum saturation , the four - quark condensate can be related to the square of the quark condensate . however , there is no convincing theoretical support for such an approximation .",
    "in fact , determinations of the vacuum condensates from data on hadronic decays of the @xmath26-lepton @xcite , as well as @xmath27 annihilation into hadrons @xcite , indicate strong deviations from vacuum saturation .",
    "theoretical arguments from chiral perturbation theory also do not support this approximation at next to next to leading order and at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "an extension of this analysis to finite temperature indicates a breakdown of vacuum saturation except in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "since there are no gauge invariant operators of dimension @xmath28 in qcd , it is standard practice to assume they are not present in the ope .",
    "this assumption is supported by results from data analyses @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ in the hadronic sector , assuming @xmath0-meson saturation of the spectral function , and a breit - wigner resonance form gives @xmath29 where @xcite @xmath30 is the leptonic decay constant , @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 gev are the @xmath0 mass and width , respectively .",
    "this finite - width parameterization has been normalized such that the area under it equals the area under a zero width expression , i.e. @xmath33 . +",
    "a test of the fesr , eq . , with @xmath34 can be performed by determining @xmath35 together with the gluon condensate and the four - quark condensate , and comparing them with results from data analyses . using the full pqcd information on @xmath36 to five - loop order , with @xmath37 @xcite , and eq .",
    "one finds @xmath38 , @xmath39 gev@xmath40 and @xmath41 gev@xmath42 .",
    "these results are in reasonable agreement within errors with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising , as the condensate determinations based on experimental data @xcite-@xcite require similar values of @xmath35 .",
    "the value @xmath43 validates the assumption of @xmath0-dominance , as the first radial excitation of the @xmath0 is the @xmath44 with a mass @xmath45 .",
    "+ the finite - width parametrization , eq . ( 6 ) , is clearly not unique . in order to test its impact on the results at @xmath8 we used instead of the standard @xmath0-propagator",
    "@xmath46 $ ] the alternative @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "we find essentially the same solution to the fesr , at five - loop order , for @xmath35 and the @xmath48 vacuum condensates provided the leptonic coupling @xmath49 is somewhat smaller , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "this will play no role at finite @xmath10 , as we shall normalize all results to their @xmath8 values , i.e. we are essentially interested in finding the thermal behavior of ratios .",
    "these ratios are hardly distinguishable from those using eq.(6 ) .",
    "+                    the extension of the fesr program to finite temperature was first outlined in @xcite . field theory arguments in support of the validity of this extension were later given in @xcite . at finite @xmath10",
    "there is an additional longitudinal structure in eq.(1 ) , but we shall consider the fesr for the transverse part . in the qcd sector",
    "one needs to restrict pqcd to the leading , one - loop level , as the appearance of two scales in @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath7 , remains an open problem ( qcd sum rules approach @xmath7 starting from @xmath8 , where pqcd is not valid ) . at this order",
    "there are two thermal contributions to the vector correlator , one in the time - like region ( @xmath53 ) and one in the space - like region ( @xmath54 ) . in the static limit ( @xmath55 ) these terms are @xmath56\\;,\\ ] ] for the time - like contribution , and @xmath57 & = & \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\ ; t^2 \\ , \\delta(\\omega^2)\\ ; , \\label{st}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the space - like region , where @xmath58 is the fermi thermal function , and the chiral limit was assumed .",
    "the vacuum condensates develop a @xmath10-dependence which can be obtained from the sum rules themselves , or by resorting to lattice qcd ( lqcd ) determinations .",
    "a non - gauge invariant , non - zero dimension @xmath28 term in the ope only appears at high temperatures @xcite , beyond the domain being normally explored with qcdsr so that it can be safely neglected .",
    "+ in the hadronic sector the leptonic coupling , the mass , and the width of the @xmath0-meson entering eq .",
    "become temperature dependent .",
    "in addition , there is a hadronic contribution in the space - like region due to the coupling of the vector current to two pions in the thermal bath , and given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the bose thermal function .",
    "given that there are only three leading fesr , and a few more parameters , the following strategy has been adopted .",
    "first , results for the quark condensate from lqcd @xcite was used as a first approximation to @xmath61 in vacuum saturation .",
    "next , we took guidance from the temperature dependence of leptonic couplings , masses , and widths determined in other light- and heavy - light - quark hadronic channels .",
    "we then explored the six - dimensional parameter space using this information , seeking a solution to the three fesr that would make physical sense , i.e. that would agree with expectations as developed in other channels .",
    "this means a decreasing @xmath2 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath61 , together with an increasing @xmath64 with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "a scanning of the parameter space shows a welcome highly peaked structure with almost overlapping solutions involving two _ critical _ temperatures .",
    "one for deconfinement , @xmath7 , pertaining to the vanishing of @xmath2 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , and to the divergence of @xmath65 . and another temperature for the vanishing of the four - quark condensate , @xmath66 , which turns out to be essentially the same as that for the vanishing of the gluon condensate , and some 5% lower than @xmath7 .",
    "this set of solutions require the @xmath0-mass to decrease with increasing @xmath10 , although it remains non - zero at @xmath3 .",
    "however , since the resonance width diverges at this temperature , the @xmath0-meson is no longer seen in the spectrum .",
    "the fesr cease to have solutions close to the deconfinement temperature , @xmath67 , as found in previous analyses of this channel @xcite-@xcite , as well as in the axial - vector channel @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figs . 1 - 6 , and correspond to the following analytical expressions @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , @xmath71\\ ; , \\label{c6f}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , and @xmath74\\ ; , \\label{mass}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , constrained to satisfy @xmath77 .",
    "the slight @xmath78 difference between @xmath7 and @xmath79 is well within the accuracy of the method .",
    "a change in the values of the parameters @xmath80 in eqs.- affects the behaviour of @xmath2 , @xmath62 , and @xmath81 . in order to retain the qualitative behaviour of the full six quantities ,",
    "the parameters @xmath80 are restricted to changes not greater than @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the temperature @xmath66 is rather tight , with a maximum allowed change of @xmath84 , while @xmath85 could vary in the range @xmath86 . +",
    "a fit to the results for the remaining three parameters gives @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , corresponding to @xmath90 .",
    "+ the behavior of @xmath2 , fig .",
    "1 , is somewhat similar to the recent result in the axial - vector channel @xcite . while the hadronic spectral function is very different in these two channels , pqcd is chiral - symmetric ( in the chiral limit ) .",
    "this result is pointing to an approximate universality of the deconfinement transition in light - quark systems .",
    "the different behaviour close to the critical temperature can be traced to the contribution of the quark condensate ( equivalently the pion decay constant ) in the axial - vector channel , which is absent in the vector correlator ( at @xmath13 the term @xmath91 is negligible ) .",
    "the thermal width of the @xmath0-meson , fig .",
    "3 , exhibits a dramatic increase of roughly a factor 20 near @xmath7 . its functional form , eq .",
    ", should be of use in current experiments measuring dimuon production in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the result for the thermal gluon condensate , fig .",
    "5 , is in good agreement with lqcd @xcite , and the four - quark condensate , fig .",
    "6 , is compatible with the behaviour of @xmath92 , albeit with a coefficient different from that in the vacuum saturation approximation .",
