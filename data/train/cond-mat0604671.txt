    "ultracold quantum gases provide a very exciting branch of physics . besides the interesting physics that the gases offer by themselves , it has also been possible in the last few years to model with quantum gases systems from other branches of physics , and by doing so to provide answers to long - standing questions .",
    "the latter is mainly due to the amazing accuracy by which their properties can be tuned and manipulated .",
    "this involves the trapping potential , the dimensionality , the interaction between the atoms , and the statistics . by using a three - dimensional optical lattice the superfluid - mott insulator transition in the bose - hubbard model",
    "has been observed @xcite .",
    "bosonic atoms confined in one - dimensional tubes by means of a two - dimensional optical lattice where shown to realize the lieb - liniger gas @xcite .",
    "the unitarity regime of strong interactions was reached by using feshbach resonances to control the scattering length @xcite .    to this shortlist of examples from condensed - matter theory ,",
    "also examples from high - energy physics can be added . in a spinor bose - einstein condensate with ferromagnetic interactions skyrmion physics",
    "has been studied @xcite , whereas an antiferromagnetic spinor bose - einstein condensate allows for monopole or hedgehog solutions @xcite .",
    "there is also a proposal for studying charge fractionalization in one dimension @xcite , and for creating ( static ) non - abelian gauge fields @xcite . in recent work @xcite",
    "we have added another proposal to model a system from high - energy physics . by combining a vortex line in a one - dimensional optical lattice with a fermionic gas bound to the vortex core",
    ", it is possible to tune the laser parameters such that a nonrelativistic supersymmetric string is created .",
    "this we called the ultracold superstring .",
    "this proposal combines three topics that have attracted a lot of attention in the area of ultracold atomic gases .",
    "these topics are vortices @xcite , bose - fermi mixtures @xcite , and optical lattices @xcite . apart from its potential to experimentally probe certain aspects of superstring theory , this proposal is also very interesting because it brings supersymmetry within experimental reach .",
    "supersymmetry is a very special symmetry , that relates fermions and bosons with each other .",
    "it plays an important role in string theory , where supersymmetry is an essential ingredient to make a consistent theory without the so - called tachyon , i.e. , a particle that has a negative mass squared . in the physics of the minimally extended standard model , supersymmetry is used to remove quadratic divergences .",
    "this results in a super partner for each of the known particles of the standard model . however , supersymmetry is manifestly broken in our world and none of these superpartners have been observed . a third field where supersymmetry plays a role is in modeling disorder and chaos @xcite .",
    "here supersymmetry is introduced artificially to properly perform the average over disorder .",
    "finally , supersymmetry plays an important role in the field of supersymmetric quantum mechanics , where the formal structure of a supersymmetric theory is applied to derive exact results .",
    "in particular this means that a supersymmetry generator @xmath0 is defined , such that the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath1 , which is one of the basic relations in the relativistic superalgebra .",
    "it is important for our purposes to note , that this relation is no longer enforced by the superalgebra in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "careful analysis @xcite shows that in this limit the hamiltonian is replaced by the number operator , i.e. , @xmath2",
    ". it may sometimes be possible to write a nonrelativistic hamiltonian as the anticommutator of the supersymmetry generators , but this does not correspond to the nonrelativistic limit of a relativistic theory .    in our proposal , a physical effect of supersymmetry is that the stability of the superstring against spiraling out of the gas is exceptionally large , because the damping of the center - of - mass motion is reduced by a destructive interference between processes that create two additional bosonic excitations of the superstring and processes that produce an additional particle - hole pair of fermions .",
    "moreover , this system allows for the study of a quantum phase transition that spontaneously breaks supersymmetry as we will show .",
    "another very interesting aspect of the ultracold superstring is the close relation with string - bit models @xcite .",
    "these are models that discretize the string in the spatial direction , either to perturbatively solve string theory , or , more radically , to reveal a more fundamental theory that underlies superstring theory .",
    "string - bit models describe the transverse degrees of freedom of the string in a very similar fashion as in our theory of the ultracold superstring .    in this article",
    "we investigate in detail the physics of ultracold superstrings , expanding on our previous work @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give the detailed derivation of the conditions for the ultracold superstring to be created .",
    "in particular , we pay attention to the presence of the fermionic bound state in the vortex core and the tuning of the lasers to reach supersymmetry . in sec .",
    "iii we investigate the experimental consequences of the supersymmetry .",
    "iv contains a detailed description of the supersymmetry by studying the superalgebra . in sec . v we make connection with string theory .",
    "finally , we end with our conclusions in sec .",
    "our proposal makes use of the fact that a vortex line through a bose - einstein condensate in a one - dimensional optical lattice can behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "such an optical lattice consists of two identical counter - propagating laser beams and provides a periodic potential for atoms .",
    "when applied along the symmetry axis of a cigar - shaped condensate , which we call the @xmath3 axis from now on , the optical lattice divides the condensate into weakly - coupled pancake - shaped condensates . in the case of a red - detuned lattice ,",
    "the gaussian profile of the laser beam provides also the desired trapping in the radial direction .",
    "rotation of the bose - einstein condensate along the @xmath3 axis creates a vortex line that passes through each pancake .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the vortex position are greatly enhanced in this configuration because of the small number of atoms @xmath4 in each pancake , which can be as low as @xmath5 , but is typically around @xmath6 .",
    "an added advantage of the stacked - pancake configuration , as opposed to the bulk situation , is that the dispersion of the vortex oscillations is particle like .",
    "this ultimately allows for supersymmetry with the fermionic atoms in the mixture . in the one - dimensional optical lattice",
    "the vortex line becomes a chain of so - called pancake vortices .",
    "this produces a setup which is pictured schematically in fig [ artimpl ] .",
    "there is a critical external rotation frequency @xmath7 above which a vortex in the center of the condensate is stable .",
    "for @xmath8 the vortex is unstable , but because of its euler dynamics , it takes a relatively long time before it spirals out of the gas @xcite .",
    "we analyze in detail the case of @xmath9 , i.e. , the situation in which the condensate is no longer rotated externally after a vortex is created .",
    "however , the physics is very similar for all @xmath8 , where supersymmetry is possible .",
    "the temperature is taken to be well below the bose - einstein condensation temperature , so that thermal fluctuations are strongly suppressed .",
    "we only consider the zero - temperature limit , because supersymmetry is formally broken for nonzero temperatures .",
    "a convenient choice for the boson - fermion mixture is @xmath10rb and @xmath11k , since such bose - fermi mixtures have recently been realized in the laboratory @xcite , and because the resonance lines in these two atomic species lie very nearby .",
    "the mostly used @xmath12 hyperfine spin states are @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath11k , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for @xmath10rb @xcite .",
    "they all have a negative interspecies scattering lenght @xmath18 , which is not desirable for our purposes as we show below .",
    "it could be possible to use other spin states , which have a positive interspecies scattering length .",
    "an other possiblity is to tune the scattering length , using one of the various broad feshbach resonances that can make the interaction repulsive while keeping the probability to create molecules negligible @xcite .    in principle",
    "it is also possible to use other mixtures .",
    "another bose - fermi mixture that has been realized in the laboratory consists of @xmath19na and @xmath20li atoms @xcite .",
    "this mixture is less convenient because the resonance lines are widely separated , so that the two species feel very different optical potentials and it is hard to trap both with a single laser .",
    "in addition , @xmath21li is relatively hard to trap in an optical lattice because of its small mass . for these reasons ,",
    "the @xmath19na-@xmath21li mixture can only be used in a very restricted parameter regime , as we will show lateron in fig .",
    "[ tuning1 ] . for the same reasons ,",
    "the mixture @xmath10rb - @xmath21li @xcite does not work well either .",
    "the mixture @xmath22li-@xmath21li @xcite can not be used at all , because the resonance lines of the species are the same , so it is impossible to tune the physical properties of the mixture .      because the excited states of the bosonic and fermionic atoms have different transition frequencies , the optical lattice produces for the two species a periodic potential with the same lattice spacing , but with a different height , as schematically shown in fig .",

    "on the other hand , the optical lattice should not be so strong to drive the system in the mott - insulator state @xcite . in one dimension with many atoms per site ,",
    "this requires an exceptionally deep lattice , which only occurs if the laser frequency is very close to the resonance frequency of the atomic species .",

    "we follow the derivations in earlier work @xcite , where a specific ansatz for the wavefunction was used , to achieve this . in this work",
    "the condensate density was described by a gaussian wavefunction with size @xmath43 and the vortex core was approximated by a step function .",
    "furthermore , it was assumed that the vortex is close to the center .",
    "the motion of the vortices results in kelvons , i.e. , quantized oscillations of the vortex , described by the creation and annihilation operators @xmath44 which obey @xmath45 . without the optical lattice kelvin waves have already been observed @xcite .",

    "using another ansatz for the condensate wavefunction can slightly change the constant of proportionality in the definition of the kelvon operators and in the details of the dispersion , but the dispersion always stays tight - binding like . for the calculation of the bound state in the vortex core , we need to go beyond the description of the core by a step function .",

    ", we have to solve the gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate wavefunction @xmath53 coupled to the schrdinger equation for the fermion wavefunction @xmath54    @xmath55    which we investigate for the case that @xmath9 .",
    "the interaction paramaters are related to the scattering lengths according to @xmath56 with @xmath57 the boson - boson scattering length and @xmath18 the boson - fermion scattering length and @xmath58 the reduced mass @xmath59 .",
    "although it is very well possible to solve these equations numerically , we prefer an analytic treatment , to gain more insight into the problem .",
    "to proceed we make the approximation that the condensate wavefunction is not affected by the presence of the fermions .",
    "this is justified , because the contribution of the fermions is @xmath60 smaller than the contribution of the bosons , where @xmath61 is the average number of bosons and fermions at a lattice site .",
    "this ratio will be smaller than @xmath62 as it turns out .",
    "taking into account the interaction with the fermions leads to a slightly wider vortex core , which enhances the possiblity of a bound state .",
    "so we first solve the gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate density neglecting the presence of the fermions and then use the condensate density as an effective potential for the fermions .",
    "since we only want to estimate when there is a bound state and we do not need the details of this bound state , we make the following approximations .",
    "first , we assume the vortex to be in the center such that the problem is rotationally symmetric and we only have to solve the radial equation . because of the quantum uncertainty the vortex position in principle fluctuates around the center of the trap , but these fluctuations are small .",

    "this potential has a bound state for each value of @xmath76 , because for large distances from the core , it behaves as @xmath77 .",
    "however , the size of the wavefunction describing the bound state becomes extremely large for small values of @xmath76 .",
    "hence it is necessary to take into account the exact form of the potential to make a quantitative estimate of the existence of the bound state .",
    "the potential is determined by the values of the radial bosonic and fermionic harmonic length @xmath49 and @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath78 determines the potential outside the condensate , it determines whether or not the fermions can tunnel out of the core to this region . for the existence of the bound state",
    "we can neglect this contribution , which is always justified , because it enhances the possibility of having a bound state .",

    "since the core is small in this approximation , this results in a radial harmonic length that is only slightly modified .",
    "the requirement that the wavefunction should vanish well within the condensate can then be quantified to yield the expression @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the radial size of the fermionic wavefunction . in this way we obtain",
    "that for typical densities there is a bound state for @xmath85 which means that @xmath86 .",
    "in contrast to the radial bosonic length @xmath49 , the fermionic radial harmonic length @xmath78 is not fixed .",
    "when the optical lattice is red - detuned , the lattice can be used to trap the atoms also in the radial direction . as a consequence ,",
    "the total confining potential for the fermions is a multiple of the confining potential of the bosons , i.e. , @xmath87 this gives the relation @xmath88 from which we derive @xmath89    however , if the lattice is blue - detuned or if the radial trapping is tuned independently , this relation is not true . the radial trapping can be tuned by introducing a second running laser in the same direction as the optical lattice , as shown in fig [ extra_laser ] .",
    "the new laser beam has a constant intensity along the @xmath3 axis , and does not influence the one - dimensional potential wells , but it does change the radial confinement . in principle",
    "this second laser also introduces interference terms , but they are much faster than the atoms can follow for the frequencies of interest to us .",
    "therefore , the intensities of the two lasers can simply be added . in particular , as we show lateron , adjusting the radial trapping potentials is needed to get supersymmetric interaction terms .",

    "this allows the fermionic atoms to tunnel out of the vortex core , to the region where the condensate density vanishes .",
    "however , the tunneling is suppressed by increasing the parameter @xmath76 .",
    "a wkb estimate gives that for @xmath92 the lifetime of the fermions in the core is larger than a second .",
    "this means that @xmath93 . further increasing this",
    "ratio increases this lifetime dramatically . since adjusting the radial trapping potentials",
    "is only needed close to the center of the trap , it is also a possibility to use a second laser with a much smaller waist , such that higher - order contributions from the potential prevent the fermions from tunneling out of the core . for various situations , the effective potential for the fermions is shown in fig [ effpot ] .     and energies in units of @xmath69 .",

    "the kelvon - kelvon interaction coefficient is given by @xcite @xmath100- \\frac{3}{2}\\right).\\ ] ] in addition , a repulsive interaction between the kelvons and the fermionic atoms is generated by the fact that physically the presence of a kelvon means that the vortex core is shifted off center , together with the fermions trapped in it . because of the radial confinement experienced by the trapped fermions , this increases the energy of the vortex .",

    "a second property of this action is , that the fermionic part has classically chiral symmetry , but quantum - mechaniclly suffers from a chiral anomaly . whereas in string theory this is an unwanted feature , in our case it has a physical origin , because it comes about from the fact that the underlying microscopic theory does not conserve the chiral current @xmath150 , and only conserves the current @xmath151 associated with the conservation of the total number of fermions .",
    "the presence of a kelvon implies that neighbouring vortex cores are slightly shifted with respect to each other .",
    "this effect decreases the fermionic hopping amplitude and results in a interaction term that couples fermions on neighbouring sites of the form @xmath152 since this term breaks supersymmetry , we want to investigate the system parameters for which it can be neglected , i.e. , for which @xmath153 . to do",
    "so we consider a kelvon with a certain wavenumber @xmath154 . the relative distance between neighboring cores kan then be estimated to be @xmath155 from eq .",
    "( [ vortexcore ] ) we know that for small distances the vortex core can be modeled as a harmonic potential with width @xmath66 .",
    "hence , the fermionic wavefunctions are gaussians with the same width .",
    "so we have to compute @xmath156 where we used the relation from eq .",
    "( [ tfr ] ) . from this same relation",
    "we see that @xmath157 scales with the number of bosonic atoms @xmath4 , such that @xmath158 is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath159 to be of order unity , such that the requirement for @xmath158 to be small only depends on the wavenumber @xmath154 . if we identify this wavenumber with the fermi momentum , i.e. , @xmath160 we obtain a restriction on the fermionic filling fraction which can be estimated to be @xmath161 from fig .",
    "[ tuning2 ] we see that for most of the parameter space this condition is fullfilled .",
    "it is an important question how the supersymmetry can be observed .",
    "therefore we need to distinguish between the question whether the hamiltonian is tuned to be supersymmetric and whether the quantum ground state is supersymmetric , since it is possible that the ground state can spontaneously break supersymmetry .",
    "we are primarely interested in the situation that both the hamiltonian and the quantum ground state are supersymmetric .",
    "the two observables that are most easy to measure experimentally are the average number of fermions at a site @xmath112 and the average number of kelvons @xmath162 .",
    "the average fermion number can be determined by usual absorpsion measurements",
    ". the number of kelvons can be obtained from the mean - square displacement @xmath163 of the pancake vortices , which can be measured by imaging along the @xmath3 direction the size of the circle within which the vortex positions are concentrated @xcite .",
    "because @xmath164 this can directly be translated to the number of kelvons at a site .",
    "it is clear that in order to have a supersymmetric state , the kelvon and fermion modes should have the same average occupation number , i.e. , @xmath165 this allows us to devise an experimental measure for the proximity to the supersymmetric point , which can be directly measured , namely @xmath166 this quantity has an absolute minimum of zero at the supersymmetric point , so that it s magnitude is a measure of the deviation from supersymmetry .",
    "we can extend this to higher order correlation functions .",
    "the condition that @xmath167 can be used to prove that in order to have supersymmetry also the condition @xmath168 should hold . the quantiy @xmath169 can again be measured from the distribution of the measured vortex postions .    , the left diagram is called @xmath170,title=\"fig : \" ] , the left diagram is called @xmath170,title=\"fig : \" ]    .",
    "[ diagramsl ]      another consequence of supersymmetry that can be directly measured is the reduced dissipation .",
    "dissipation in this context results in the vortex spiraling out of the gas .",
    "the dominant part of the dissipation is given by the coupling to the kelvon modes and the fermionic modes .",
    "the lowest order diagrams are given in fig.[diagramsl ] and denoted by @xmath171 for the coupling to the kelvon modes and @xmath170 when there is also coupling to the fermionic modes .",
    "the imaginary part of these diagrams measures the dissipation . in order to be able to know the dissipation away from the supersymmetric point we perform the calculation for unequal dispersions @xmath172 and unequal coupling constant @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "we introduce the usual notation for the bose - einstein and fermi - dirac distribution functions @xmath175 the diagrams are then given by    @xmath176    where the minus sign in front of the expression for @xmath177 comes from the presence of the fermion loop .",
    "note that due to the different combinatorial factors the diagram @xmath178 comes with an extra factor of two , which is lacking in the case of the diagram @xmath179 . as a result , the two diagrams do not cancel exactly at the supersymmetric point , as we claimed previously @xcite . instead , the dissipation is reduces by a factor 2 @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the diagrams gives the following expressions @xmath180    at zero temperature we have that @xmath181 , and @xmath182 . using this",
    ", we see that if there is supersymmetry , i.e. , if @xmath183 and @xmath184 , we have that @xmath185 and in particular that @xmath186 such that at zero temperature supersymmetry results in a dissipation rate that is only half as large as in the case of a ordinary vortex - line . using these expressions , it is also possible to calculate the quantum dissipation at nonzero temperature , or when supersymmetry is broken .",
    "in particular , when the interaction coefficients are tuned away from the supersymmetric point such that @xmath187 and supersymmetry is maintained at the quadratic level , the dissipation exactly vanishes and the superstring is extremely stable in the center of the condensate .",
    "when the hamiltonian is supersymmetric , the ground state still can break supersymmetry .",
    "this is the phenomenon of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking . for @xmath188 ,",
    "the ultracold superstring is unstable against bose - einstein condensation of kelvons .",
    "this breaks supersymmetry , because the fermionic modes can not bose - einstein condense .",
    "bose - einstein condensation implies that the kelvon annihilation operator obtains an expectation value @xmath189 from the definition of the kelvon operator we conclude that as a consequence @xmath190 this means that the vortex moves out of the center of the trap .",
    "experimentally this is easy to measure .",
    "moreover , by monitoring the vortex position when it moves out of the center of the trap , this also allows for the experimental investigation of the dynamics of supersymmetry breaking . as a consequence of the breaking of the @xmath191 symmetry because of the bose - einstein condensation ,",
    "the dispersion of the kelvon modes becomes gapless .",
    "the dispersion becomes the usual bogoliubov dispersion , which reads @xmath192 with @xmath193 . for long wavelengths",
    "this yields a linear behaviour .",
    "also the fermionic modes become gapless .",
    "this is a result of the breaking of supersymmetry and this mode is called the goldstino . because @xmath194 , the dispersion for the goldstino is given by @xmath195 which results in a quadratic dispersion .",
    "clearly the bosonic and fermionic dispersion in eqs . and are now different , which signals a nonsupersymmetric situation .",
    "in this section we review the algebra associated with supersymmetric field theories both in the relativistic ( super poincar algebra ) and the non - relativistic limit ( super galilei algebra ) .",
    "we give an explicit representation of the super galilei algebra in terms of the bosonic and fermionic operators .",
    "associated with a relatistic field theory in @xmath196 dimensions is the poincar algebra , whose generators consist of a vector @xmath197 , that generates translations and an antisymmetric tensor @xmath198 , that generates lorenz transormations .",
    "the greek indices run from @xmath101 to @xmath199 , such that @xmath200 should be identified with the hamiltonian @xmath201 , up to a constant .",
    "the algebra is then given by @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the flat space minkowski metric .",
    "when there is supersymmetry we can extend this to the super poincar algebra . for @xmath148 supersymmetry in @xmath204 dimensions",
    "this involves the two - component majorana spinor @xmath205 , @xmath206 , which is the generator of supersymmetry transformations .",
    "the algebra is then extended to include also @xmath207 where the @xmath208 are again the dirac matrices .",
    "we use conventions such that @xmath205 has two real components . to make connection with the supersymmetry in the ultracold superstring we combine these two components in one complex supersymmetry operator @xmath209 this decomposition breaks manifest lorentz symmetry , but",
    "since we are ultimately interested in the nonrelativistic limit , this is of no concern to us here . as a result",
    "we obtain the following algebra @xmath210 in particular , we see that the hamiltonian @xmath200 is fixed by the supersymmetry generator .",
    "this is a very peculiar restriction on the hamiltonian , which is only true for the relativistic theory . in the nonrelativistic limit , the supersymmetry decouples from the space - time translation symmetry as we show now .",
    "the galilei algebra can be derived as a limit of the poincar algebra by performing a inn - wigner contraction @xcite in the following way @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath211 where @xmath135 is the speed of light and @xmath212 denotes the mass , which is the same for the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "we also defined a number operator @xmath213 , which counts all the particles in the system , and boost operators @xmath214 .",
    "furthermore , we still have the space translation generators @xmath215 and the hamiltonian @xmath216 .",
    "we can now take the limit @xmath217 to obtain the super galilei algebra .",
    "the galilei algebra obtained in this manner has nonvanishing commutators @xmath218 the part involving the supersymmetry becomes only @xmath219 this defines the algebra @xmath220 @xcite . as is clear , in this case the hamiltonian is decoupled form the supersymmetry . in @xmath204 and @xmath221 dimensions , it is sometimes possible to define an extended superalgebra @xmath222 , which again involves the hamiltonian @xcite . in @xmath223",
    "this amounts to introducing an extra scalar supersymmetry generator @xmath224 with the algebra : @xmath225      the representation for the @xmath226 algebra in terms of the bosonic and fermionic operators @xmath134 and @xmath135 , can easily be found to be @xmath227 in addition , we can thus also define @xmath228 this produces @xmath229 which indeed is the kinetic energy part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the full quadratic part of the hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath230 for completeness , we mention that we can also use superspace techniques to write the hamiltonian in a manifest supersymmetric way .",
    "this involves the introduction of a complex superfield @xmath231 where @xmath232 is a grassman variable such that @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "the hamiltonian is in terms of the superfield given by @xmath235 in this formulation the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is particularly elegant , because the hamiltonian has the form of a standard landau theory of a second - order phase transition with @xmath236 as the order parameter .",
    "in this section , we discuss the similarities and differences with superstring theory . for some textbooks on the subject , we refer to refs .",
    "in string theory , one usually starts with the polyakov action @xcite , describing the coordinates @xmath237 , with @xmath238 , of the string propagating in a @xmath239-dimensional curved space - time with metric @xmath240 , @xmath241 here @xmath242 are coordinates on the worldsheet sweeped out by the string , @xmath243 is the worldsheet time , and @xmath84 runs longitudinally over the string .",
    "furthermore , @xmath244 is the string tension , and @xmath245 is a two - dimensional metric on the worldsheet with @xmath246 . in agreement wit the standard practice in high - energy physics we are momentarily using units such that @xmath247 .",
    "we restore units when we come to the precise connection with our ultracold superstring . in fully quantized string theory ,",
    "one also performs a path integral over these metrics , and this leads to the string loop expansion where one sums over all two - dimensional surfaces containing an arbitrary number of holes . in our setup , the worldsheet of the string is completely fixed , and contains no holes , i.e. , it is just the two - dimensional plane . on the plane",
    ", we can then make use of the local symmetries of the polyakov action , that are the reparameterizations of the worldsheet coordinates and the weyl rescalings of the metric .",
    "doing so , we can make the gauge choice @xmath248 this gauge choice is referred to as the conformal gauge .",
    "the space - time in which the string propagates is coordinatized by @xmath249 . in quantized superstring theory one has that @xmath250 , but at the classical level one can have @xmath251 as well .",
    "we come back to this issue below .",
    "it is useful to introduce light - cone variables @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "then @xmath254 and @xmath255 describe the longitudinal and transversal degrees of freedom of the string , respectively .",
    "string theory has the special feature that there are only transversal physical degrees of freedom .",
    "this is because string theory has an additional constraint that can be understood as the equation of motion of the worldsheet metric @xmath245 . defining @xmath256 ,",
    "these constraints read in conformal gauge @xmath257 and are sometimes called the virasoro constraints . in practice , solving the constraints is difficult , but in the so - called light - cone gauge @xmath258 where @xmath259 and @xmath260 is the center - of - mass momentum in the @xmath261 direction , the longitudinal modes @xmath254 can be eliminated explicitly , at least for certain space - time metrics @xmath262 . the light - cone gauge can always be taken as a consequence of the residual gauge symmetry after the gauge choice of eq .",
    "has been imposed @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the constraints in eq .   in the quantum theory leads to the critical dimension , namely @xmath263 for the bosonic string and @xmath250 for the superstring . in our condensed - matter setup , these constraints are not present .",
    "there are physical longitudinal degrees of freedom , so this makes it different from the superstring .",
    "however , the longitudinal modes are suppressed and at the energy scales we are looking at , it suffices to study only the transversal degrees .",
    "it is in this transversal sector that we connect to string theory . to make this connection",
    ", we have to specify the space - time metric @xmath262 .",
    "a class of backgrounds that has been intensely studied in the string literature is that of plane wave metrics @xcite .",
    "the simplest of these backgrounds , and also the one relevant for our case , is given by @xmath264 where @xmath265 is a function of the transverse coordinates only . in light - cone gauge , the lagrangian for the string propagating in this background now becomes @xmath266 - v(x^i)\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath267 . to derive this result",
    ", we simply substitute the background in eq .   into eq .  , and use the light - cone gauge from eq .   to produce the potential @xmath268 term in the lagrangian  .",
    "furthermore , this produces a term proportional to @xmath269 that is decoupled from the @xmath255 .",
    "therefore this term can be dropped .",
    "in fact @xmath269 is fixed by the virasoro constraints in eq .",
    ", so we only need a lagrangian for the transverse degrees of freedom .    one of the remarkable facts of string theory is that its conformal symmetry at the quantum level forces the metric to satisfy einstein s equations in general relativity . this is the way in which gravity emerges from string theory .",
    "when there are no other background fields present , as in our case , einstein s equations reduce to a single constraint on the function @xmath270 given by @xmath271 in other words , @xmath270 has to satisfy the laplace equation in the transverse space .",
    "this constraint has to be understood on an equal footing as the constraint on the space - time dimension .",
    "they both follow from a consistent implementation of the conformal symmetry at the quantum level .",
    "since we are not taking into account the virasoro constraints in our system , and hence the conformal symmetry , we therefore also ignore the constraint in eq .. doing so , we can work with arbitrary potentials @xmath268 .",
    "when we take @xmath251 , as we shall below , the scalar potential depends on two real fields .",
    "we now include the fermions , and discuss supersymmetry . to make a superstring we have to add additional terms to the lagrangian in eq . containing the fermions in such a way that there is supersymmetry",
    ". we can then impose the conformal or light - cone gauges to arrive at a supersymmetric generalization of the lagrangian in eq .. alternatively , we can directly study supersymmetric extensions of eq .   as two - dimensional field theories .",
    "the general construction of supersymmetric two - dimensional field theories with scalar potentials @xmath268 was given in ref .",
    "not all potentials lead to lagrangians that can be supersymmetrized . for the case of minimal supersymmetry with two supercharges , sometimes denoted by ( 1,1 ) susy , the potential needs to be of the following type @xmath272 where @xmath273 is a real function , @xmath274 stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath255 , and the quantities @xmath275 satisfy @xmath276 together with @xmath277 .",
    "the supersymmetric lagrangian can then be written as @xmath278 with @xmath279 the supersymmetry variations are @xmath280 and leave the lagrangian invariant , up to a total derivative . here",
    "@xmath281 and @xmath282 are two - component majorana spinors , and in our model we thus have two majorana spinors .",
    "the @xmath283-matrices are related to the pauli matrices as @xmath284 and @xmath285 as before . for more details on the spinor conventions ,",
    "see ref . @xcite .",
    "examples of supersymmetric models are given by @xmath286 where @xmath287 and @xmath288 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "plugging this into eq",
    ".   leads to   to @xmath273 .",
    "this leads , however , to terms in the potential @xmath289 with odd powers in @xmath224 , which is not what we are looking for . ]",
    "@xmath290 up to an irrelevant additive constant , the coefficients @xmath288 can be chosen such that the potential is as in our condensed - matter setup .",
    "furthermore , we have that @xmath291 which leads to mass terms for the fermions , and supersymmetry variations of the fermions of the form @xmath292 this term rotates the fermions into the bosons , just like for the ultracold superstring . if we compute @xmath293 to determine the interactions between bosons and fermions , it produces complicated interaction terms , @xmath294 as a result of the supersymmetry constraints .      to connect to our condensed - matter setup , we have to take the nonrelativistic limit in which only particle excitations of the two - dimensional field theory survive , and the anti - particle excitations are absent . to illustrate this procedure ,",
    "we start with the bosonic part of the lagrangian in eq .  ,",
    "based on two real scalar fields . in terms of the complex field",
    "@xmath295 the lagrangian reads @xmath296 where we have reinserted the speed of light @xmath135 in order to take the nonrelativistic limit @xmath297 below , and we further used that the potential is a function of @xmath224 only since this is the case of interest .",
    "using now the mass @xmath212 , we decompose the complex scalar field in terms of positive and negative frequency modes @xmath298 and call @xmath134 the particle field and @xmath299 the antiparticle field . both @xmath134 and @xmath299",
    "are complex .",
    "we now substitute eq .   into eq .   and send @xmath297 . in this limit ,",
    "the lagrangian becomes first order in time derivatives , and particles and antiparticles decouple from each other such that we can effectively set @xmath300 .",
    "the remaining terms in the nonrelativistic limit are @xmath301 where we have reinserted the various factors of @xmath302 .",
    "moreover , we have absorbed a mass term proportional to @xmath303 into the potential .",
    "remind that we have chosen a potential of the form given in eq .",
    ", so this mass term can easily be absorbed into a change of the coefficients @xmath304 or @xmath305 .",
    "notice that this lagrangian precisely coincides with the bosonic sector of lagrangian of the ultracold superstring given in eq . .",
    "the fermionic sector can be obtained in a similar way .",
    "in this paper we presented a detailed account of the conditions under which the ultracold superstring can be created .",
    "the requirements for the laser parameters and the atomic interactions were given .",
    "moreover we payed attention to the experimental signatures of supersymmetry .",
    "the supersymmetry in the problem was investigated by studying the appropriate super algebra .",
    "finally , a precise mathematical connection with string theory in @xmath149 dimensions was made .",
    "the discussions in this article were limited to the case of a single string .",
    "it is left for future investigation to extend the analysis to involve more strings .",
    "a complication in this case is that for parallel vortex lines , supersymmetry is not possible , because of the different way vortices and fermions interact with each other .",
    "a proposal to overcome this problem is to study the interaction of two superstrings that are both in the center of the condensate , but are seperated on the @xmath3 axis .",
    "this would correspond to merging and splitting of ultracold superstrings .",
    "the typical fermionic number of particles that is needed to obtain supersymmetry is typically around @xmath306 per site .",
    "this is rather low , both to control and to observe .",
    "however , the density is rather high and can be estimated to be at least @xmath307 . moreover , a disadvantage of a higher fermionic atomic density is that this makes also the contribution of the kelvon - fermion hopping interaction more important .",
    "it remains to be investigated , whether a change of the varous parameters can improve on this situation .",
    "apart from the other possibilities mentioned in this article , it is also possible to gain experimental insight in the system by coupling the vortex motion to resonant quadrupole modes @xcite .",
    "this gives the possibility to measure the kelvon dispersion directly .",
    "if the system is brought out of equilibrium by populating a high - lying kelvon mode , it also opens up the exciting possibility to study collapse and revival phenomena between the bosonic and fermionic modes .",
