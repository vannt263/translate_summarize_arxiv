    "the size of a quantum register can be increased either by increasing the number of qubits ( in the standard model of a quantum computer ) or by increasing the number of accessible logical states in each quantum element i.e by using qudits ( quantum digits )  @xcite . for qudit computing to become a reality , it is essential to concretize the theoretical framework for computation in terms of a set of quantum gates that are universal and can implement any algorithm efficiently .",
    "it is however not always straightforward to generalize a qubit gate to the qudit scenario and in some cases , more than one kind of generalization is possible , each retaining some features of the original qubit gate  @xcite .",

    "the quantum fourier transform ( qft ) needs to be specifically tailored for qudit computers as it plays a key role in several quantum algorithms such as factorization  @xcite , quantum phase estimation  @xcite and the hidden subgroup problem  @xcite .",
    "an efficient decomposition of the qft for qubits achieves an exponential speedup over the classical fast fourier transform  @xcite , and has been experimentally implemented by several groups on different physical systems  @xcite .",
    "decompositions of the qft for qudit systems have been worked out by several groups  @xcite .    in nmr systems with `` strong '' spin - spin coupling terms in the hamiltonian , the identification of spins as qubits becomes problematic . in such cases ,",
