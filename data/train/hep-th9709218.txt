    "this strong and weak duality allows a reliable perturbative treatment of potential curve crossing phenomena at the both limits of very weak ( adiabatic picture ) and very strong ( diabatic picture ) potential crossing interactions .",

    "( see  fig .  1 ) .",
    "if one neglects the last term in the above hamiltonian , one obtains the unperturbed hamiltonian in the diabatic picture @xmath5 this hamiltonian  @xmath6 describes two potentials , which are decoupled from each other .",

    "we thus conclude that the two extreme limits of potential crossing interaction should be reliably handled in perturbation theory ; namely , the strong potential crossing interaction in the _ diabatic _ picture , and the weak potential crossing interaction in the gauge transformed _",

    "we emphasize that the numerical coefficient of  @xmath90 is fixed by time - independent perturbation theory and the local data without referring to global stokes phenomena ; this is satisfactory since linear potential crossing is a locally valid idealization .",

    "we again interpret  ( [ eq : three.thirtyfour ] ) as twice the potential crossing probability because our initial state wave function contains the reflection wave as well as the incident wave .",
    "the transition probability per one potential crossing is given by the half of  ( [ eq : three.thirtyfour ] ) .",

    "motivated by duality , we re - examined a perturbative derivation of the landau - zener formula , and we re - derived the formula  ( [ eq : three.twentyfour ] ) including its numerical coefficient on the basis of perturbation theory .",
    "however , our final result  ( [ eq : three.twentyfour ] ) in the adiabatic picture does not contain the coupling constant as a prefactor .",
    "this is related to an interesting topological object in the present formulation . from the definition of  ( [ eq : two.ten ] )",
    ", the `` gauge field '' satisfies the relation @xmath98 which is _ independent _ of the coupling constant  @xmath8 ; we assume @xmath99 for  @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "because of this kink - like topological behavior of  @xmath13 , the coupling constant does not appear as a prefactor of the matrix element in perturbation theory if the wave functions spread over the range which well covers the geometrical size of  @xmath19 . the precise criterion of the validity of perturbation theory is thus given by  ( [ eq : two.eleven ] ) : this condition is in fact satisfied if the conditions ( [ eq : three.eleven])([eq : three.twelve ] ) are satisfied . for small values of  @xmath101 , the small coupling  @xmath8 helps to satisfy  ( [ eq : two.eleven ] ) . even for the values of  @xmath101 near the average turning point  @xmath55",
    ", we have @xmath102 where @xmath56  stands for the typical geometrical size of  @xmath19 .",
    "the estimate in the left hand side is based on linear potentials  ( [ eq : three.fifteen ] ) , but we expect that the condition is satisfied for more general potentials as well .",
    "we thus clarified the basic mechanism why the prefactor of the landau - zener formula  ( [ eq : three.twentyseven ] ) should come out to be very close to unity in time - independent perturbation theory .",
    "motivated by the presence of interesting weak and strong duality in the model hamiltonian  ( [ eq : two.one ] ) of potential curve crossing , we re - examined a perturbative approach to potential crossing phenomena .",
    "we have shown that straightforward _ time - independent _ perturbation theory combined with the zeroth order wkb wave functions provides a reliable description of general potential crossing phenomena .",
    "our analysis is based on the local data as much as possible without referring to global stokes phenomena .",
    "formulated in this manner , perturbation theory becomes more flexible to cover a wide range of problems .",
    "the effects of dissipative interactions on macroscopic quantum tunneling have been extensively analyzed in the path integral formalism  @xcite and also in the canonical ( field theoretical ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the ohmic dissipation suppresses the macroscopic quantum coherence ; in fact , an attractive idea of a dissipative phase transition has been suggested  @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that the effects of potential curve crossing with nearby potentials influence the quantum coherence of the two degenerate ground states .",
    "one can in fact confirm that the potential curve crossing generally suppress the quantum coherence by using the perturbation theory for both limits of strong and weak curve crossing interactions  @xcite . from a view point of symmetry ,",
    "the lowest order perturbation in the present problem and the dissipative interaction in the caldeira - legget model  @xcite both correspond to a dipole approximation .",
    "however , a perturbative analysis of basically non - perturbative tunneling phenomena requires a great care . in  ref .",
    "@xcite , an explicit calculation of rather limited configurations has been performed , which in fact indicates the general suppression of quantum coherence by potential curve crossing . this suppression phenomenon of quantum coherence may become important in the future when one takes the effects of the environment into account in the analysis of potential curve crossing processes .    from a view point of general gauge theory , it is not unlikely that the electric - magnetic duality in conventional gauge theory is also related to some generalized form of potential crossing in the so - called moduli space  @xcite .",
    "we hope that our work may turn out to be relevant from this view point also .",
