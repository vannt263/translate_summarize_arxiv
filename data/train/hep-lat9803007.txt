    "in this work the 4@xmath4 pure compact u(1 ) gauge theory is revisited . this model , being the prototype of gauge abelian interaction , has received a lot of attention through the years , since it constitutes a preliminary step in approaching qed . however , the questions related with the mechanisms driving the transition and with the order of the phase transition itself , have turned out to be a more controversial issue than one might expect from its apparent simplicity .    through this section",
    "we shall summarize the main results obtained up to date .",
    "the 4@xmath4 pure compact u(1 ) theory is known to undergo a phase transition between a region in which the photons are confined ( strong coupling ) and another region in which they carry a coulomb potential ( weak coupling ) .",
    "the theory can be discretized in the lattice using the wilson action @xmath5 \\ . \\label{sw}\\ ] ]    most of the work has been done on the hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions , namely on the hypertorus . on this topology",
    "the pioneer studies ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) pointed to a continuous transition since numerical simulations did not evidence signals of metastability .",
    "the confinement - deconfinement transition sets in at a coupling @xmath6 .",
    "the largest lattice size simulated in those works was @xmath7 .",
    "however , as simulations in larger lattices became available to computer resources , metastabilities were evidenced , and two - peaked energy histograms could be observed from @xmath8 on ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) pointing to a first order character for the phase transition .",
    "this idea was also supported by several works that approached the problem from the point of view of the renormalization group @xcite .    nowadays , though the general belief is that the transition is first order , there are still some puzzling questions .",
    "namely , the numerical simulations up to @xmath9 do not reveal a stable latent heat , it is rather decreasing with the lattice size , and also , the associated critical exponent @xmath10 is always in the interval @xmath11 , which is different from the first order value ( @xmath12 ) and from the trivial second order one , namely @xmath13 .",
    "these facts led some authors to wonder about the possibility of a slowly vanishing latent heat , which could eventually go to zero in the thermodynamic limit . in short ,",
    "the 4@xmath4 pure compact u(1 ) theory could be critical provided the two peaks appearing in the simulations are a finite size effect . due to the physical implications of a critical theory with non trivial critical exponents this possibility was not completely ruled out .",
    "now , we go back in time to introduce the extended wilson action .",
    "besides the wilson action , an action including a term proportional to the square of the plaquettes was proposed by g. bhanot at the beginning of the eighties @xcite @xmath14 + \\gamma \\sum_{\\rm p } [ 1 - { \\mathop{\\rm re}\\nolimits}{\\mathop{\\mathrm{tr}}}u_{\\rm p}^2 ] \\ . \\label{sew}\\ ] ]    in that work the extended ( @xmath15,@xmath3 ) parameter space was explored in @xmath16 , and it was suggested that the phase transition line @xmath17 became first order for @xmath18 , while for @xmath19 the transition appeared to be second order on those small lattices .",
    "the phase diagram is represented in figure [ phd ] .",
    "simulations in larger hypercubic lattices have shown that two metastable states are present for all , up to date , positive and negative simulated @xmath3 values .",
    "what holds true is the observation that a positive @xmath3 value reinforces the transition towards the first order , while a negative @xmath3 value weakens the transition .",
    "in fact , the latent heat , @xmath20 , decreases with @xmath3 , and then , a coupling where @xmath20 goes to zero was supossed to exist at some finite ( negative ) value of @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior induced some authors to conjecture about the existence of a tricritical point ( tcp ) at some negative coupling @xmath21 where the order of the phase transition could change from being first order to be continuous @xcite .",
    "however , every simulation performed at negative @xmath3 has exhibited double peak structures for large enough @xmath22 .",
    "as for the wilson action ( @xmath23 ) , for negative @xmath3 a non stable latent heat is revealed by simulating in lattice sizes in the range @xmath24 .    from the point of view of the renormalization group this problem was studied in @xcite and the results pointed to a phase transition line @xmath17 of first order for all @xmath3 except at the end , @xmath25 , where the transition is second order with trivial exponents .",
    "nowadays , it is generally accepted that the transition is first order for positive @xmath3 values .",
    "however for @xmath26 two scenarios arise : 1 ) the phase transition line @xmath17 is first order everywhere except at @xmath27 ; 2 ) there is a finite @xmath28 from which on , the phase transition is second order .",
    "as we have already remarked , all the previous discussions refer to simulations performed on the hypertorus .",
    "recently some authors have cast a new hue on this problem .",
    "it was suggested some years ago that the jump in the energy observed when the confining - deconfining transition takes place , could be due to the existence of closed monopole loops wrapping around the toroidal lattice , which due to the particular topology can not be contracted to a point @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis led authors to work on lattices homotopic to the sphere , since on this topology all monopole loops can be contracted to a single point @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the closed monopole loops and the discontinuity in the energy is far from being proved .",
    "the influence of those non trivial monopole loops on the phase transition has been studied by rebbi and coworkers @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that the properties of the phase transition seem not to be affected by the existence of such closed monopole loops .",
    "however it is claimed the two state signal does dissapear when working on a lattice constructed considering the surface of a 5@xmath4 cube , which has the topology of a sphere @xcite . this single peak structure together with the estimation of the critical exponent @xmath29 measured at @xmath30 , has induced authors in @xcite to claim that the double peak signal on the torus is a finite size effect , and when working on the sphere one observes that indeed the line @xmath17 for @xmath26 is a line of second order phase transitions , all of them in the same universality class characterized by a @xmath10 exponent around @xmath31 . assuming this second order scenario for the pure gauge theory ,",
    "fermions have been included ( on the toroidal topology ) in order to study how fermions fit in the u(1 ) theory .",
    "also in this case a second order phase transition is conjectured to exist @xcite .",
    "this situation is somehow disturbing , because one would expect to get the asymptotic behavior of a phase transition earlier on a lattice which is homogeneous and translationally invariant , namely the hypertorus , than on a lattice which is manifestly non homogeneous , as is the surface of a 5d cube , and on which the translational invariance is only recovered in the limit of infinite volume .",
    "first order phase transitions exhibit a wide variety of behaviors .",
    "some of them do not show any pretransitional effect , the correlation length at the critical point , @xmath32 , is small , and the thermodynamic quantities diverge as the volume for reasonable lattice sizes .",
    "however when the correlation length is very large , pretransitional effects take place , and they can also be very significant . in literature these transitions are referred to as weak first order ( wfo ) phase transitions and are characterized by small discontinuities , such as a small latent heat .",
    "depending on whether or not @xmath22 is larger than @xmath32 , a wfo phase transition presents two differentiate regions :    * _ transient region _ ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the transition behaves like a second order one , since @xmath32 is effectively infinite .",
    "thermodynamic quantities diverge less than @xmath34 and hence the effective critical exponent @xmath10 is larger than @xmath35 .",
    "* _ asymptotic region _",
    "( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the first order character of the transition is revealed by the onset of a stable two - peak structure and an effective @xmath10 compatible with @xmath35 .",
    "how large should @xmath32 be for the transition to be considered wfo seems a subjective matter . since @xmath37",
    "always , all first order transitions would be weak in some extent . the key point for a transition to be considered",
    "wfo is the existence of pretransitional effects .",
    "the pretransitional behavior makes the transition along the transient region to look like a second order one with a definite critical coupling @xmath38 .",
    "this second order phase transition is preempted by the true first order one at the coupling @xmath39 .",
    "the distance between the couplings @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be taken as a measure of the weakness of the transition @xcite .",
    "typical examples of such wfo transitions are 2@xmath4 potts models @xcite and the deconfining transition in finite t qcd @xcite .    from this description",
    "it is clear that the observation of no double - peak structures does not prove by itself the second order character of a phase transition .    in view of this",
    ", we decided to make a systematic study of the phase transition line @xmath17 on the hyper - torus ( @xmath40 topology hereafter ) and on the lattice with spherical topology following @xcite ( which will be referred to as @xmath41 topology ) . on the hypertorus we improve on the statistics running up to @xmath42 at some negative @xmath3 values . on the sphere we have run lattices substantially larger than those employed by authors in @xcite to check if the two - state signal reappears when",
    "larger spheres are considered .",
    "our preliminary results , suggesting that the double peak structure indeed reappears , are published somewhere else @xcite . here , the statistics on those lattice sizes have been increased , and simulations in larger lattices are included .",
    "new observables are used to extract our conclusions .",
    "we shall consider the parameter space described by the extended wilson action , which can be expressed in terms of the plaquette angle in the following way :    @xmath43    we use for the simulations the conventional @xmath44 hypercube with toroidal boundary conditions ( hypertorus ) , and , for comparison we also consider the surface of a @xmath45 cube which is topologically equivalent to a @xmath44 sphere .",
    "contrarily to the hypertorus , the surface of a @xmath45 cube is not homogeneous .",
    "there are a number of sites which do not have the maximum connectivity , namely 8 neighbors . due to this fact",
    ", uncontrolled finite size effects are expected to turn up .",
    "their influence can be somehow alleviated by the introduction of appropriate weight factors in those inhomogeneous sites @xcite . since the topology remains unchanged and we do not expect the order of the phase transition to be affected by the rounding , we do not use weight factors .    as a notational remark ,",
    "we label with @xmath22 and @xmath46 the side length for the @xmath40 topology and for the @xmath41 topology respectively .",
    "next we define the energies associated to each term in the action @xmath47    where @xmath48 stands for the number of plaquettes . on the hyper - torus",
    "this number is simply proportional to the volume , namely the forward plaquettes are @xmath49 . on the sphere",
    "the number of plaquettes has a less simple expression , and can be computed as a function of @xmath46 as @xmath50 . in this case , the system is not homogeneous and @xmath48 is not proportional to the number of points on the four dimensional surface , which is @xmath51 , some points having a number of surrounding plaquettes less than the possible maximum @xmath52 , as opposed to what happens on the torus . in order to allow comparison , we define @xmath53 , in such a way that a hypertorus of @xmath54 has the same number of plaquettes as the corresponding hypersphere",
    ".    the specific heat and the binder cumulant are useful quantities to monitorize the properties of a phase transition . at the critical point , they are known to posses different thermodynamical limits depending on whether the transition is first order or higher order , and hence , their behavior with increasing lattice size can give some clues as to the order of the phase transition .",
    "we have studied the finite size scaling ( fss ) of these two energy cumulants .",
    "the specific heat is defined for both energies as :    @xmath55    @xmath56    as we have observed a high correlation between both energies , the results being qualitatively the same , we shall only report on the observable defined for the plaquette energy @xmath57 .    in a second order phase transition , scaling theory predicts the specific heat maximum to diverge as @xmath58 .",
    "if the transition is first order it is expected to diverge like the volume @xmath34 ( or strictly like the number of plaquettes @xmath48 ) reflecting that the maximum of the energy fluctuation has the size of the volume .",
    "this is expected to hold in the asymptotic region of the transition @xmath36 . in the transient region , namely @xmath59",
    ", the specific heat is expected to grow more slowly than the volume .",
    "we shall use the number of plaquettes @xmath48 to study the specific heat behavior in order to have a single parameter for both the @xmath40 and the @xmath41 topologies .",
    "this is of course equivalent to doing the discussion as a function of @xmath22 on the @xmath40 and @xmath60 on the @xmath41 .",
    "we have in this case @xmath61 .",
    "we have also studied the behavior of the fourth cumulant of the energy @xmath62    when the energy distribution describing the system is gaussian @xmath63 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is the case for a second order phase transition .",
    "if the transition is first order , far from the critical coupling @xmath39 , @xmath64 also tends to 2/3 , reflecting the gaussianity of the energy distribution .",
    "however , at @xmath39 the distribution can be described by two gaussians centered about the energy of each metastable state @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and hence this quantity has the non - trivial thermodynamic limit    @xmath67    another interesting quantity measurable from the density of states is the distribution of the partition function zeroes , or lee - yang zeroes @xcite . to clarify the role of the partition function zeroes let us first stress a well known fact : there are no phase transitions on a finite volume , phase transitions arise in the thermodynamical limit and are signaled by non - analyticity in the free energy :    @xmath68    @xmath69 is a linear combination of exponentials , and hence an analytical function .",
    "this implies that the free energy can be singular only where @xmath70 .",
    "however if the coupling @xmath15 is real , and the volume is finite , that linear combination is a sum of positive terms and hence , the zeroes of @xmath69 are located in the complex plane of the coupling @xmath15 .",
    "the onset of the phase transition in the limit of infinite volume is signaled by a clustering of the zeroes on the real axis at @xmath39 .",
    "here follows the description of our procedure , for a general description of the method see @xcite .",
    "as mentioned previously we work only with @xmath57 , and then we consider only the spectral density method @xcite for this variable .",
    "since we work at fixed @xmath3 we consider only the @xmath15 coupling derivatives .    from the mc simulation at @xmath15",
    "we obtain an approximation to the density of states which allows us to compute the normalized energy distribution @xmath71 .",
    "the energy distribution can be expressed as    @xmath72    we use the standard reweighting technique to obtain from the distribution measured at @xmath15 the distribution at another coupling @xmath73 , which is complex in the more general case @xmath74 .",
    "the standard reweighting formula is :    @xmath75    using ( [ prob ] ) and the normalization condition @xmath76 one obtains    @xmath77    we can factorize the contributions from the real and imaginary part :    @xmath78    this is the standard reweighting formula extended to the complex parameter space of couplings . as a first observation we have a pure oscillating factor due to @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath80 is @xmath81 this is a rapidly oscillating function which makes it impossible to locate zeroes with large imaginary part .",
    "the real part of the coupling contributes to the well known exponential damping , @xmath82 , which is telling us that we can trust the extrapolation only in a small neighborhood @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath84 has no zeroes in a finite volume , an easy way to locate the zeroes numerically is looking at the minima of the function @xmath85 , where :    @xmath86    the function to minimize is :    @xmath87    one interesting property of the partition function zeroes concerns the estimation of critical exponents . denoting by @xmath88 the coupling where the first zero is located , the distance to the real axis scales with the @xmath10 exponent :    @xmath89    we shall use this property to compute the effective @xmath10 exponent .    from @xmath90 , we can measure the free energy gap , @xmath91 , which is the difference between the minima and the local maximum of the free energy @xcite .",
    "we use the spectral density method to get , from the measured histograms , a new histogram where both peaks have equal height .",
    "we take the logarithm of those histograms and measure the energy gap .",
    "a growing @xmath91 in the asymptotic region of the transition implies a first order phase transition .",
    "an increase proportional to @xmath92 is expected @xcite . for the transition to be second order",
    ", @xmath91 must stay constant with increasing lattice sizes .",
    "[ tabla_esfera ]    [ tabla_toro ]    most of the work has been done by simulating the subgroup @xmath93 , since the phase transition associated to the discrete group lies safely far away .",
    "the overrelax algorithm can be applied only in the simulations with @xmath23 so that the gain in statistical quality due to the overrelax effect is limited to the wilson action , where we have simulated both , the full group @xmath94 and the discrete one for the sake of comparison . for @xmath95",
    "we have simulated the discrete group since so the simulation is considerably speeded up .    for every lattice size we consider , we perform trial runs to locate the coupling @xmath96 where the specific heat shows a peak .",
    "we use the standard reweighting techniques to extrapolate in a neighborhood of the simulated coupling .",
    "once the peak is located within an error in the fourth digit of the coupling , we perform an intensive simulation there to get @xmath97 .",
    "the statistics performed at these pseudo - critical couplings are reported in table [ tabla_esfera ] and table [ tabla_toro ] for the @xmath41 and the @xmath40 topology respectively .",
    "typically we measure the energies every 10 @xmath98 sweeps in order to construct the energy histogram ( [ prob ] ) from this energy distribution we obtain the cumulants of the energy we are interested in , and the critical exponents using finite size scaling techniques .",
    "we remark that one of the main sources of systematic error when measuring critical exponents , is the indetermination in the coupling @xmath96 where to measure .",
    "the simulations have been done in the _ rtnn _ machine consisting of 32 pentium pro 200mhz processors .",
    "the total cpu time used is the equivalent of 6 pentium pro years .",
    "we have updated using a standard metropolis algorithm with 2 hits .",
    "the acceptance has always been between 65% and 75% .    in order to consider the statistical quality of the simulation , following",
    "@xcite we define the unnormalized autocorrelation function for the energy c(t ) = _ i=1^n - t e_i e_i+t - e ^2  , as well as the normalized one ( t ) =  .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation time for the energy , @xmath99 , can be measured using the window method ^int(t ) = + _ t^ = 1^t ( t^ )  ,    for large enough @xmath100 , which is in practice selected self - consistently .",
    "we use @xmath100 in the range 5@xmath99 , 10@xmath99 , and we check that the obtained @xmath99 remains stable as the window in @xmath100 is increased .    we have always started from hot and cold configurations in order to make sure that the system does not remain in a long living metastable state , which could be interpreted as a dirac sheet .",
    "the results coming from both types of starts have always been indistinguishable .",
    "we have studied the deconfinement - confinement phase transition line at several values of @xmath3 ( figure [ phd ] ) .    in the region of negative @xmath3 ,",
    "apart from the deconfinement transition line , there is another transition line provoked by the competing interaction between the couplings ( @xmath101 ) . in the limit @xmath27",
    "the model is not dynamical since for all finite @xmath15 , @xmath102 .",
    "so we expect this line to end at the corner @xmath103 .",
    "we have not performed a deep study of this transition line , however the simulations at @xmath104 revealed double - peak structures pointing to a first order character .",
    "the limit @xmath105 is equivalent to a @xmath106 theory and the critical point can be calculated exactly by self - duality .",
    "we have studied carefully the region between lines @xmath107 and @xmath108 finding no signatures of the existence of additional lines .",
    "we have focused on the transition line @xmath107 , at several values of @xmath3 , on the hyper - torus and on the hyper - sphere .",
    "the structure of this section is the following :    first , we describe the results at @xmath109 on the spherical topology .",
    "our purpose is to observe how does the @xmath41 topology behave in a non controversial region , and comparing with the known results on the hypertorus .",
    "second , we study the point @xmath23 ( wilson action ) on the spherical lattice .",
    "this coupling has been recently claimed to be the starting point of a critical line ( infinite correlation length at the critical point ) which extends in the range @xmath26 , with an associated critical exponent @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "since this assertion relies on the absence of two - state signals on spherical lattices up to @xmath110 , we shall check whether or not double peak structures set in when larger spheres are considered .",
    "third , we go to the region of negative @xmath3 .",
    "we are aware of no previous systematic study on the hypertorus in this region , so we run simulations up to @xmath42 at @xmath111 . motivated by the results on the hyper - torus we have just run a single @xmath3 negative value on the hyper - sphere . for the sake of comparison with @xcite we choose this value to be @xmath112 .",
    "finally , we discuss the finite size scaling behavior exhibited by both topologies .      as we have pointed out ,",
    "there is a general agreement on considering the phase transition first order in the region of positive @xmath3 .",
    "the lattice sizes used range from @xmath114 to @xmath115 , which correspond to @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively see ( table [ tabla_esfera ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ evol02 ] , the mc evolution for @xmath118 is shown .",
    "we remark that no multicanonical update is needed to obtain a very high rate of flip - flops up to @xmath115 .",
    "however , on the torus , for @xmath119 the probability of tunneling between both metastable states is so tiny that a reasonable rate of flip - flops is not accessible to ordinary algorithms .",
    "probably the inhomogeneity of the sphere is increasing the number of configurations with energies which correspond neither to the confined nor to the deconfined phase , but in between .",
    "these configurations make the free energy gap to decrease and hence the tunneling is easier on the @xmath41 topology . in short , the sites without maximum connectivity act as catalysts of the tunneling .    in figure [ histo02 ]",
    "the energy distributions are plotted .",
    "the distribution at @xmath120 is distinctly non - gaussian , but a blatant two - peak structure is observed only from @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) on .",
    "so , when comparing with the result at @xmath123 on the torus , ( see small window in figure [ histo02 ] ) a first observation is that the onset of a two - state signal is particularly spoiled by the @xmath41 topology , at least in 4@xmath4 pure compact u(1 ) gauge theory .    concerning the latent heat , we remark its stability already at @xmath121 , or , if anything , its increase from @xmath121 to @xmath115 .",
    "one would even say that the same happens between the positions of the would - be two states in @xmath120 and the position observed in @xmath121 .",
    "the behavior of the binder cumulant reflects this fact ( see figure [ binder02 ] ) .",
    "we observe a rapid growth of @xmath124 for small lattices sizes , apparently towards @xmath125 ( second order value ) .",
    "this growth stops when the splitting of the two peaks is observed .",
    "the splitting of the two peaks is reflected by smaller values in @xmath124 .",
    "we remark that the errors quoted for @xmath124 are calculated taking into account the indetermination in the value of the minimum , but not the displacement in the position of the coupling where the minimum appears .    in our opinion , mainly two reasons can give account of this behavior .",
    "the first one comes from general grounds : at the very asymptotic region of a first order phase transition , the energy jump gets sharper and sharper , and a slightly increase of the latent heat could be expected",
    ". the second one would be the increasing restoration of homogeneity in the hypersphere when increasing the lattice size .",
    "the latent heat observed in small @xmath46 might be affected by the inhomogeneity of the hyper - sphere .    at this point",
    "we can not give a single reason for this to happen .",
    "we postpone a stronger conclusion to the section devoted to the finite size scaling discussion .",
    "the value of the latent heat when obtained with a cubic spline fit to the peaks in @xmath115 is @xmath126 .",
    "results obtained with mixed hot - cold starts in @xmath127 seems to give an energy jump around 0.067 .",
    "however the reliability of this method is very limited and we do not dare to extract strong conclusions from it . taking into account",
    "that he cubic spline at @xmath121 gives 0.053(2 ) a possible scenario would be a slowly increasing latent heat towards its asymptotic value @xmath128 .",
    "the peak of the specific heat for the different lattice sizes is displayed in figure [ peaks02 ] .",
    "the continuous line represents the @xmath129 extrapolation .",
    "the plot of the peak value , @xmath130 as a function of the plaquette number reveals a linear relationship , and hence a first order character .",
    "let us first situate the status of the studies using the toroidal topology with the wilson action .",
    "as we have pointed out in the introduction , the transition was believed to be continuous till the simulation of a @xmath8 lattice revealed the first signs of the existence of two metastable states @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations up to @xmath132 showed a rapid decrease of the latent heat when increasing the lattice size , suggesting that the two metastable states might superimpose in the limit @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite , azcoiti et al . suggest that the latent heat starts to stabilize at @xmath134 .",
    "when one tries to simulate large lattices the tunneling becomes scarce and the use of multicanonical simulations for those lattice sizes seems to be in order .",
    "however , in spite of its usefulness in spin models , we are aware of no multicanonical simulation showing a substancial flip - flop rate improvement for this model . an alternative procedure to enhance the tunneling probability has been proposed in @xcite . within this approach the use of a monopole term in the action as a dynamical variable , has been revealed as a useful method to increase the flip - flop rate .",
    "lattice sizes up to @xmath135 have also been studied using multihistogramming techniques @xcite and rg approaches @xcite .",
    "the results support the idea of a quasi stable latent heat for @xmath136 .",
    "topological considerations stressed already in the introduction led some authors to use lattices homotopic to the sphere . in the case of the wilson action ( @xmath23 ) the two - state signal",
    "is absent up to @xmath110 @xcite . following this , we have simulated on the spherical topology in lattices ranging from @xmath120 to @xmath137 , finding that the two - state signal sets in from @xmath138 on .",
    "the preliminary results up to @xmath138 are already published @xcite .",
    "we include here the results with higher statistics in @xmath138 and the results in @xmath137 .    the mc evolution for @xmath139 is plotted in figure [ evol0 ] . for the @xmath137 lattice we have four independent runs , signaled by the dashed lines in the figure , all of them giving the same predictions .    in figure [ histo0 ] the distribution of @xmath57",
    "is plotted in lattices ranging from @xmath120 to @xmath137 .",
    "we observe that a two - peak structure is revealed first time by the histogram in @xmath138 , which has a @xmath140 . on the toroidal topology",
    "the equivalent signal is observed already at @xmath8 ( see small window in figure [ histo0 ] ) .",
    "having in mind the results of the previous section at @xmath109 , it seems that the minimum @xmath60 required to observe a two - peak structure in the spherical topology is around three times the minimum lattice size @xmath22 needed in the torus to observe two peaks .",
    "the lattice sizes used in @xcite at @xmath141 ranged from @xmath114 to @xmath110 , so it is not surprising that they did not see any two - peak structure .",
    "our results are in that sense compatible with theirs , though ours show a faster divergence for @xmath142 with increasing @xmath46 than the one observed in @xcite in the lattice sizes we share ( n=6,8,10 ) .",
    "however we are particularly confident on this point because our simulation has been performed closer to the peak of the specific heat @xmath96 , and so we expect the ferrenberg - swendsen extrapolation to be more precise .    for the sake of comparison with the full group u(1 ) , simulations with the wilson action",
    "have been performed at @xmath143 . at this coupling",
    "an implementation of overrelax is possible , and the global decorrelating effect should manifest itself in a better statistical quality .    in figure [ histo0o ] we show the histograms of @xmath57 from @xmath120 to @xmath138 simulating the full group .",
    "the results are fully compatible with those obtained from simulations with @xmath144 .",
    "this test being performed , we go back to the description of the results obtained for the discrete group .",
    "in figure [ peaks0 ] we plot @xmath145 for different @xmath146s , together with the ferrenberg - swendsen extrapolation .",
    "the small window is a @xmath147 plot of @xmath148 as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "a linear behavior is observed from @xmath110 on , which is even faster than linear when @xmath137 is taken into account .",
    "this fact by itself implies the first order character of the transition since it means that the maximum in the energy fluctuation has the size of the volume . as a further check we have measured the @xmath10 exponent from the scaling of the fisher zeroes ( see table [ tabla_esfera ] ) .",
    "in figure [ fisher0 ] we plot @xmath85 for several lattice sizes on the spherical topology at @xmath143 .",
    "the different curves stand for the different @xmath73 we extrapolate . for small lattice sizes @xmath149",
    "is larger , and the damping is more severe than for the larger lattices since in the later the imaginary part contributes with a faster oscillating function .",
    "actually , we observe that for @xmath137 even a second minimum could be measured before the signal is damped , while for @xmath110 one can measure accurately only the first one .    the results for the effective @xmath10 are plotted in figure [ nuesfera ] lower window . as could be expected from the behavior of the specific heat , for small lattices",
    "the effective exponent is somewhat larger than @xmath150 .",
    "it gets compatible with the first order value from @xmath110 on . in the largest lattices the distance between the two peaks slightly increases , and we measure a @xmath151 slightly smaller than the first order value . as",
    "a @xmath152 is strictly impossible we expect this to be a transient effect due to finite size effects associated to the observed splitting up of the two peaks .",
    "concerning the latent heat , we observe a behavior completely analogous to the one observed at @xmath109 .",
    "we do observe a two peak structure quite stable when comparing @xmath138 and @xmath137 , but it slightly increases in @xmath137 .",
    "the plot of the binder cumulant reflects again this fact ( see figure [ binder0 ] ) .",
    "the fast growth of @xmath124 towards @xmath125 is preempted by the onset of double peaked histograms from @xmath138 on , and it even decreases in @xmath137 .",
    "the cubic spline fit in @xmath137 at the peaks gives for the latent heat @xmath153 .",
    "which is compatible with the results suggested by extrapolating to infinite volume the values obtained on the torus up to @xmath154 .",
    "our results are hence supporting the conjecture stressed in @xcite about a quasi stabilization of the latent heat on the torus from @xmath9 on .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of the transition at several negative values of @xmath3 on the toroidal topology .",
    "we find that the two - state signal persists for all @xmath3 values we consider .",
    "the energy histograms reveal an increasing weakness of the transition when going to more negative @xmath3 values ( see figure [ histo_toro ] ) .",
    "a double peak structure is clearly visible at @xmath156 in @xmath104 , while at @xmath157 one has to go to @xmath9 to observe an equivalent signal .    in what concerns the behavior of the free energy gap @xmath91",
    ", it grows for all investigated lattice sizes at all negative @xmath3 values ( see figure [ gap_lat ] lower window ) .",
    "the value of @xmath22 at which @xmath91 starts growing is certainly larger as the value of @xmath3 is more negative .",
    "this is another test of the increasing weakness of the transition as @xmath3 gets more negative .",
    "the statistics performed on the torus are reported in table [ tabla_toro ] .",
    "we also quote for the different negative @xmath3 , the value of @xmath96 and the position of partition function zero closest to the real axis .",
    "we have computed from the imaginary part of the zeroes the effective @xmath10 exponent between consecutive lattice sizes following ( [ nu ] ) .    in figure [ nu_toro ]",
    "we plot for the different @xmath3 values the @xmath151 we measure . in all cases a @xmath158 is observed for small lattice sizes , which gets closer to 0.25 when the lattice is large enough . from this figure",
    "the trend of @xmath151 seems rather clear towards the first order value .    from the energy distributions we measure the latent heat through a cubic spline at the peaks .",
    "taking into account the value @xmath159 we measure , we plotted it as a function of the inverse of the volume @xmath160 , which is also the expected behavior of the latent heat when the transition is first order .",
    "the latent heat can be extrapolated to a value which is safely far from zero ( see figure [ gap_lat ] upper window ) .    in figure [ peaks_toro ]",
    "we plot @xmath161 as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "as could be expected from the behavior of the effective exponent @xmath10 , the maximum of the specific heat for small lattices diverges slower than the volume . for the smaller lattices the effective exponent is @xmath162",
    "this value increases monotonically with the lattice size . in the largest ones we observe @xmath163 .      on the toroidal topology",
    "we have found that the minimum lattice size required to observe a two state signal is obtained through an apropriate combination @xmath164 , with increasing @xmath165 for increasingly negative @xmath3 , the behavior being qualitatively similar for all the @xmath3 values we have investigated . in view of this",
    ", we have studied a single @xmath155 value on the spherical lattice to check if the two state signal is absent on this topology . for the sake of comparison with @xcite",
    "we choose this value to be @xmath112 .",
    "we have run simulations on spheres ranging from @xmath120 ( @xmath166 ) to @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "the mc evolution is plotted in figure [ evol_02 ] .",
    "the distribution in @xmath137 is distinctly non gaussian and the splitting of the peaks occurs in @xmath167 ( see figure [ histo_02 ] ) .",
    "we remark that the simulations in @xmath167 are extremely expensive in cpu . in order to alleviate thermalization",
    "we have parallelized the code using shared memory in two ppro processors . in this lattice",
    "we have run two independent simulations starting from different configurations the results being fully compatible .",
    "the behavior of the maximum of the specific heat is shown in figure [ peaks_02 ] .",
    "we observe the same trend than in the previous values of @xmath3 in the sphere , i.e. , an increasingly fast divergence of the specific heat with the lattice size , showing an effective @xmath169 already when the histogram width becomes constant with increasing lattice size .    at this value of @xmath3",
    "we have a worse estimation for the latent heat to be , as the two peaks have not split enough to allow an accurate measurement .",
    "again the behavior of the binder cumulant is very significant ( see figure [ binder_02 ] .",
    "the value @xmath124 shows a very fast trend towards 2/3 in the small lattices . when increasing the lattice size the rate gets slower , and finally the value in @xmath167 is compatible with the value in @xmath137 preempting the extrapolation to @xmath125 .",
    "unfortunately lattices larger than @xmath167 are unaccessible to our computers nowadays , and we can not observe a decreasing @xmath124 as we did for the other @xmath3 values . however from the behavior between @xmath137 and @xmath167 an increasing @xmath124 for larger spheres seems to be very unlikely .    concerning the effective critical exponent @xmath10 we have measured the position of the first fisher zero ( see table [ tabla_esfera ] ) and compute @xmath151 ( see figure [ nuesfera ] ) .",
    "again the first order value @xmath35 is reached in the largest lattices .      due to the fact that on the sphere there are a number of points with less than the maximum connectivity",
    ", violations to standard fss in the form of uncontrolled finite size effects are expected to appear on this topology .",
    "we have observed all along this work that working on the spherical topology retards the onset of two - state signals .    in terms of @xmath60 , some qualitative prediction arising from our results would be that at fixed @xmath3 , the minimum lattice size required to observe a double peak structure , @xmath165 , is around three times larger on the sphere than on the torus .",
    "this one being the showier difference , is not certainly the only one .",
    "when comparing @xmath170 on both topologies one finds always smaller values on the spherical topology ( see small window in figure [ salto ] ) .",
    "we did run on @xmath9 on the torus and @xmath115 on the sphere , which has an @xmath117 , sweeping an interval of @xmath15 values including the phase transition . in figure [ salto ]",
    "we have plotted @xmath57 in both topologies . in the region of low",
    "@xmath15 the system is disordered , the entropy is higher and the system is not so sensitive to inhomogeneities of the lattice .",
    "however , in the region of high @xmath15 the energy is in general smaller than for the homogeneous lattice since the system tends to be ordered , and the influence of the sites with less than maximum connectivity is more evident .",
    "this difference gets smaller when the lattice size is increased on the sphere , and hence the energy jump is larger .",
    "this feature explains the observed splitting of the two states on the spherical lattices when increasing lattice size .",
    "altogether , it is not recommended to work on spherical lattices to check the existence or not of two - state signals . however , there are a number of facts that make this topology not so dissapointing in spite of those uncontrolled finite size effects .",
    "the first one concerns the behavior of @xmath96 and the second one the measure of the latent heat .    in figure [ betac ]",
    "we compare @xmath96 on the torus and on the sphere .",
    "a first observation is that despite they not having the same values in finite lattices , both curves get closer when increasing the lattice size .",
    "this supports the idea of a common thermodynamic limit for both topologies . on the other hand ,",
    "the shift in the apparent critical coupling with @xmath22 is much less dramatic on the sphere than on the torus .",
    "it seems that finite size corrections to @xmath39 are smaller in the case of the spherical topology .",
    "this behavior has also been observed in the ising model on spherical lattices @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the latent heat is very significant . in figure [ latcompa ]",
    "we compare the latent heat in finite volumes for both topologies . on the wilson line , at @xmath23 the asymptotic value of the latent heat",
    "is obtained in the spherical topology .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the sphere has , paradoxically , helped us to run lattices with @xmath171 without having to worry about the tunneling rate . from this graph",
    "we quote @xmath172 . in the upper window the same is plotted for @xmath112 .",
    "unfortunately we have just a single lattice size on the sphere to measure the latent heat , however , from the behavior exhibited by this topology , an increase of the latent heat on spheres larger than @xmath167 seems rather likely . altogether , at @xmath112 a @xmath173 is plausible .",
    "in what concerns the latent heat , the spherical topology seems to afford an useful complement to the results obtained for the the toroidal lattice .",
    "in fact , on the wilson line lattices larger than @xmath135 can not be studied due to the technical problem associated to the scarce tunneling .",
    "the spherical lattice alleviates this technical problem , and the results are supporting the value of the extrapolated latent heat as a function of the inverse of the volume , from the data on toroidal lattices up to @xmath135 .",
    "one could consider the possibility of simulating on spherical lattices at negative @xmath3 to solve the tunneling problem , but in our opinion , the price to pay is too high .",
    "the first order character of the deconfinement transition in pure u(1 ) has been proved , up to the limits of a rather reasonable numerical evidence , in the interval @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "in @xmath109 we have been able to stabilize the latent heat .",
    "we are aware of no simulation on the torus showing a stable latent heat due to the scarce tunneling in lattices larger than @xmath8 .",
    "the spherical topology has helped to solve this problem .",
    "however , probably any lattice with inhomogeneities would produce the same catalysing effects .",
    "in @xmath143 we have also been able to measure the asymptotic value of the latent heat .",
    "we have proved the suggestions of several authors about a quasi stabilization on lattices larger than @xmath174 .",
    "the data on the spherical topology have been crucial to discard the possibility of a slowly vanishing latent heat .",
    "it follows that the discretization of pure compact u(1 ) lgt on the lattice using the wilson action exhibits a first order phase transition with a latent heat in the thermodynamical limit @xmath175 .    on the toroidal topology things happen qualitatively in the same way than in @xmath143 up to @xmath157 .",
    "we have run on spherical lattices in @xmath112 looking for an argument similar to the one found in the wilson case concerning the stabilization of the latent heat .",
    "the simulation in @xmath167 gives an estimation for the latent heat though rather imprecise because the splitting of the peaks is not good enough for the measurement to be accurate .",
    "however , in view of the behavior exhibited by the spherical topology concerning the trend of the two peaks on spherical lattices to separate , we are prone to consider the value measured in @xmath167 as a lower bound for the latent heat in @xmath176 . on the other hand , we would at present",
    "say that the latent heat extrapolated from the data on the torus up to @xmath177 is rather accurate , in view of the behavior for the wilson case .",
    "the possibility of running larger spheres surpasses our computer resources .",
    "a highly parallelized version of the code should be used to alleviate thermalization , which is a possibility we do not discard completely at medium term .",
    "either proving or discarding the possibility of a tcp at some finite negative @xmath178 will be a very difficult task from the numerical point of view .",
    "an analytical argument would be welcome .",
    "a very tiny two - state signal , comparable with the one observed in @xmath104 at @xmath157 , is observed on the torus in @xmath135 at @xmath179 , which is the most negative value we have run on the torus .",
    "taking into account the factor 3 in @xmath60 one would need a @xmath180 sphere to observe a tiny double peak structure .",
    "simulation with spherical lattices in this range of @xmath3 have no sense , and nothing can be concluded from the absence of two state signals from such negative @xmath3 values .    in view of these difficulties to stabilize the latent heat for very negative @xmath3 values , the only chance to discern",
    "the order of the phase transition is the study of effective critical exponents .",
    "cumulants of the energy , such as the binder cumulant , have been shown to behave like expected in the first order case only when the stable two - peak structure is almost setting in , and there , we do not need further evidences any longer .",
    "we could not expect additional information since by definition the binder cumulant relies on the existence of stable latent heat in order to extrapolate to @xmath181 .",
    "the advantage of studying the effective exponents ( which is nothing but studying the evolution of the histograms width ) is that we do not need a direct observation of latent heat to conclude that a transition is first order @xcite .",
    "we have observed a @xmath151 which evolves monotonically until it reaches the first order value , namely 0.25 , in all cases .",
    "the statistics needed to observe a monotonous behavior , are order @xmath182 at the coupling @xmath96 , which has to be located with high precision ( four digits in our experience ) in order to accurately measure effective exponents .",
    "however , one has to make every effort to observe the trend of the effective exponents , since it is the only chance to discern the order of such tricky transitions .    in pure u(1 ) , for the wilson case , an exponent @xmath183 was widely predicted @xcite at the beginning of the eighties when the lattice sizes where too small to reveal two peaks . that @xmath10 was shown to become @xmath184 when simulating @xmath154 @xcite",
    "we have measured @xmath185 on spherical lattices and stated its first order character . within the approximation of effective potentials",
    "it can be shown that along the transient region of a weak first order phase transition , everything goes like in a second order one with a thermal exponent @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "together with josephson law ( @xmath187 ) it implies @xmath29 .",
    "this statement has been checked in 2d potts @xcite , 3d and 4d @xmath188 models @xcite and in the 4d su(2)-higgs at t=0 with fixed higgs modulus @xcite .",
    "our results prove that pure compact u(1 ) theory behaves in the same way .",
    "a general remark to draw from this paper is though there is no theorem constraining transitions presenting @xmath158 to be of wfo , yet the occurrence of such exponent is a warning to consider the phase transition as suspicious of being first order .",
