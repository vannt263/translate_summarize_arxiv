    "cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) are close binary systems of a white dwarf ( primary star ) and a late - type main - sequence star ( secondary star ) filling its roche - lobe ( for a review , e.g. @xcite ) . the surface gas of the secondary is transfered for the primary star , and an accretion disk is formed around the primary star . some cvs quasi - periodically show sudden brightenings , namely , outbursts .",
    "this behavior is generally explained by the thermally unstable accretion disk in the disk instability model ( for a review , @xcite ) .",
    "such cvs are called dwarf novae .",
    "dwarf novae are classified into three basic subclasses , which are ss cyg stars showing ( normal ) outbursts , z cam stars showing normal outbursts and standstills , and su uma stars showing normal outbursts and superoutbursts ( see ch . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the basic physics differentiating these three subclasses is currently understood in the scheme of the thermal - tidal disk - instability theory mentioned above .",
    "thorough exploration to explain a variety of behavior of cvs , however , is being continued .",
    "dm lyr is a poorly studied dwarf nova .",
    "this star was discovered as a nova or a u gem - type variable star by @xcite , who originally designated it as 250.1929 .",
    "he also reported a long outburst which lasted at least 12 days .",
    "@xcite gave a finding chart .",
    "based on records of 6 dwarf nova - type outbursts , @xcite estimated the outburst properties of dm lyr , which were the recurrence cycle of outburst of over 100 d , and the magnitude range of 13.717.5 : .",
    "@xcite , nevertheless , listed dm lyr as an unidentified dwarf novae .",
    "@xcite then correctly re - identified dm lyr .",
    "very recently , @xcite obtained spectra having singly - peaked emission lines indicative of a low inclination , and measured the orbital period ( ) to be 0.06546(6 ) d.    this object is identified with 1rxs j185845.1 + 301548 @xcite , while no counterpart is found in the 2 micron all sky survey @xcite .",

    "after this outburst , we again carried out photometric observations of dm lyr during the outburst in 1997 february - march .",

    "then , we subtracted 0.12 mag from the oku data to smoothly connect the oku data with the os data . using local comparison stars , constancy of the standard star during our runs",
    "was confirmed within 0.06 mag , and the nominal 1-@xmath5 error for each point was estimated .",
    "heliocentric corrections to observation times were applied before the following analysis .",

    "the enlarged light curves of our data are depicted in figure [ fig : shortlc ] . in these light curves , we succeeded in detecting the clear superhumps with an amplitude of @xmath60.12 mag on 1996 july 16 and 17 , although these oscillations were smeared by the relatively large errors on july 15 and 18 .",

    "superhumps were observed also in this outburst ( figure [ fig : shortlc ] ) , which indicates that this is the second superoutburst observed in dm lyr , apart from the first superoutburst by @xmath6230 d. after subtracting the linear decline trend of 0.10 mag d@xmath7 from the data obtained on 1997 march 1 and 4 , we made a pdm period analysis . apparent evidence of periodicity , however , was not found because of the insufficient coverages , although figure [ fig : pdm2 ] shows peaks with very small significance around the superhump frequency .",
    "we took power spectra of each - night data to search for quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , but no signal was detected .",
    "as noted in section 1 , @xcite measured the orbital period of 0.06546(6 ) d. the fractional superhump excess ( @xmath13(@xmath14)/ ) in dm lyr is then 2.8(3 ) % . generally , the superhump period decreases with the superoutburst evolving in su uma stars with a similar orbital period ( see @xcite ) , although the present data were not sufficient to derive a change of .",
    "if the superhumps were observed from the earlier phase in the 1996 superoutburst , the superhump excess was expected to be a little larger .",
    "the superhump excess of 2.8 % or a little larger is , however , just on the known -@xmath15 correlation ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this meaning ,",
    "dm lyr is a normal su uma - type dwarf nova .",
    "the visual magnitudes reported to vsnet seems to include a rather large error ( see figure [ fig : longlc ] ) , probably because of lack of a reliable sequence of comparison stars magnitudes and the effect of the close companion star .",
    "the outburst amplitude is , however , estimated to be 4.3(@xmath170.5 ) mag in figure [ fig : longlc ] , which is supported by the fact that the general catalog of variable stars @xcite lists 13.6 - 18.0p as the maximum and minimum photographic magnitudes .",
    "this outburst amplitude is also a typical value for an su uma star .",
    "table [ tab : ob ] lists all outbursts reported to vsnet so far .",
    "we can see that the first four superoutbursts almost regularly occurred with a recurrence times of 229 d , 235 d , and 275 d. these recurrence intervals are normal , or a little small values for an su uma star with the orbital period of @xmath60.067 d ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that only one normal outburst was caught during this period .",
    "@xcite derived a correlation between the mean recurrence cycles for normal outbursts ( @xmath18 ) and for superoutbursts ( supercycle , @xmath19 ) .",
    "this correlation expects @xmath18 @xmath6 46 d for @xmath19 = 250 d.    in contrast , since 1997 november , only one superoutburst in 2000 august was caught for about 5 years . instead",
    ", many normal outbursts were repeatedly found with intervals of 14 - 238 days .",
    "dm lyr has been rather closely monitored these years , except in winter when dm lyr is not observable .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that many superoutbursts have been missed . if we assume @xmath19 to be @xmath6950 d , which is the period between the 1997 november superoutburst and the 2000 july superoutburst , no normal outburst is expected according to the @xmath18-@xmath19 relation mentioned above , like wz sge - type stars or related objects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although normal outbursts may have more easily escaped from the eye because of the faintness and the short duration ( table [ tab : ob ] ) , the frequency of the normal outburst clearly changed between until 1997 and since 1998 .",
    "this change was coincident with the transition between the _ high / low states _ regarding superoutburst .",
    "in other words , dm lyr has two states : 1 ) the superoutburst phase when the superoutburst happens with a supercycle of @xmath6250 d , but dm lyr experience few normal outbursts , and 2 ) the normal - outburst phase when the normal outbursts occurs with a recurrence cycle of a few tens - a few hundreds of days , but the supercycle is @xmath61000 d. dm lyr sharply showed the transition between these two states .",

    "+   +   +    the disk instability theory predicts that both of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are tightly related to the mass transfer rate from the secondary star ( @xmath25 ) . in case of normal su uma stars , @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "is expected to be roughly proportional to @xmath26 and @xmath25 , respectively ( see section 5.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "decrease of the mass transfer rate is thus predicted to lead to increase of both @xmath18 and @xmath19 and to decrease of the number of the normal outburst during one supercycle .",
    "this trend well agrees with the empirical @xmath18-@xmath19 relation , although other parameters , such as , the orbital period , masses of the components , and so on , are neglected in this qualitative discussion .",
    "the phase transition from the superoutburst phase to the normal outburst phase in dm lyr presented here completely opposes this theoretical and empirical relation in that increase of the supercycle is accompanied with increase of the number of the normal outburst in one @xmath19 .",
    "changes of the outburst patterns in su uma stars have been reported in recent years , e.g. in di uma @xcite , su uma ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , v1113 cyg @xcite , and v503 cyg @xcite .",

    "@xmath19 in v503 cyg has been almost constant , regardless of decrease of the number of the normal outburst between two successive superoutbursts . in dm lyr , however , @xmath19 became longer at the same time when normal outbursts came to arise with shorter @xmath18 of a few tens - a few hundreds of days .",
    "since the set of @xmath19 in the superoutburst phase and @xmath18 in the normal outburst phase almost satisfies the empirical @xmath18-@xmath19 , the mass transfer rate may be constant also in dm lyr , and a mechanism to decrease the number of the normal outburst had worked during the superoutburst phase .",
    "then , a mechanism to elongate @xmath19 might start working in the normal outburst phase . to check the stability of the mass transfer rate , it is important to measure the quiescence magnitude and the amplitude of the orbital hump during the current normal outburst phase .",
    "in addition , closer monitoring is needed to confirm the existence of the future superoutburst phase and to avoid to miss normal outbursts then . in su uma , @xcite reported their superhump detection during a faint outburst ( or a minor brightening ) which arose in an anomalously outbursting state , and proposed that an long - lasting , tidally unstable state following the preceding superoutburst may suppress normal outbursts . we should try to make the monitoring going as deep as possible and to start photometric observations soon on finding a brightening .",
