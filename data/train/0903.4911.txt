    "unravelling the physics of how gas - rich disk galaxies , recently arrived in galaxy clusters , are transformed into the quiescent elliptical and s0 populations that dominate dense cluster cores at @xmath14 is one of the longest - standing unsolved problems in astrophysics .",
    "numerous studies of massive early - type galaxies in clusters have revealed predominately old stellar populations with apparently very little growth in stellar mass in massive cluster galaxies since @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the majority of stars in cluster early - type galaxies formed at high redshift , @xmath16 .",
    "however @xcite found that the fraction of cluster members with blue optical colours increases from zero in the local universe to @xmath17 by @xmath18 , suggesting that the fraction of cluster galaxies that are actively forming stars increases with increasing lookback time .",
    "empirically the star - forming spiral galaxies found by @xcite at @xmath19.20.4 are mostly replaced by s0 galaxies in local clusters @xcite .",
    "indeed , s0s may be completely absent at @xmath20 @xcite , although @xcite suggest that the s0 fraction remains constant over @xmath21 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "a simple interpretation is that clusters accrete blue gas - rich star - forming spirals at @xmath22.51 and that these galaxies were transformed somehow into the passive s0s found in local clusters .",
    "numerous mechanisms have been proposed to deplete the reservoir of gas in late - type spiral galaxies and thus cut off the fuel supply for further star - formation , leading to transformation into s0 galaxies ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "historically most of the work on this area has concentrated on optical wavelengths , for example identifying the so - called e+a galaxies @xcite . these galaxies exhibit deep balmer absorption lines and lack nebular emission lines indicating that these apparently passive galaxies were actively forming stars in the preceding @xmath23.51.5gyr .",
    "indeed , simple evolutionary models have been used to connect , via aging and thus fading , this newly quiescent population with actively star - forming spiral galaxies .",
    "mid - infrared observations of cluster galaxies with _ iso _ and _ spitzer _ have challenged the idea that all spiral galaxies that fall into clusters simply fade into passive galaxies via an intermediate e+a phase .",
    "for example , _ iso _ revealed a population of luminous infrared galaxies ( @xmath24  lirgs ) and near - lirgs in clusters that imply that the star - formation rates derived from optical diagnostics ( e.g.  [ oii ] ) under - estimate the true star formation rate ( sfr ) by @xmath2503@xmath26 ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "deep radio observations have also revealed that many e+as harbour significant ongoing star - formation missed by optical diagnostics due to heavy dust obscuration @xcite .",
    "the simple optically - derived fading of spiral galaxies therefore seems to be substantially incomplete .",
    "radio and mid - infrared observations have also revealed an order of magnitude cluster - to - cluster variations in the amount of obscured star formation in clusters @xcite .",
    "these differences have broadly been attributed to differences in the recent dynamical history of the clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however early _ iso _ results had already suggested that a simple one - to - one relationship between cluster - cluster mergers and obscured star formation does not exist .",
    "for example , _ iso _ identified 10 lirgs in cl0024 and none in a1689 , a2218 , and a2390 ( coia et al . , 2005b ; see also metcalfe et al . ,",
    "all four clusters are well known strong lensing clusters , the mass distributions of which are constrained by their strong lensing signal to be multi - modal , i.e.  indicative of recent cluster - cluster merging ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indications of the likely complex relationship between the dynamical state of clusters and their current star - formation rate was also found in the pioneering optical studies .",
    "for example , for the coma cluster @xcite found numerous galaxies with post - starburst characteristics ( strong balmer - line absorption ) between the two x - ray peaks corresponding to the main coma cluster and the ngc4839 subcluster , suggestive of starbursts and subsequent quenching resulting from a cluster - cluster merger .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found no enhancement in the blue galaxy distribution between the two x - ray peaks for an apparently similar system abell 168 .",
    "for this latter case , @xcite suggests that the lack of enhanced star - formation could be due to the galaxies being previously gas - poor and hence unable to be triggered on interaction with their environment .",
    "@xcite measured the fraction of cluster galaxies with blue optical colours out to @xmath27 , although their sample was dominated by clusters at @xmath28 .",
    "the blue galaxy fractions in these `` intermediate '' redshift clusters span the full range of values found in clusters at @xmath14 and @xmath27 , i.e.  @xmath2900.2 .",
    "numerous uv / optical , infrared and radio surveys have broadly confirmed that the scatter is large , however none have combined the sample size and multi - wavelength dataset required to relate directly actively star - forming galaxies in clusters to differences in the intracluster medium and recent dynamical history of clusters .    the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss ; pi : g.  p.  smith ; http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/locuss ) is a systematic multi - wavelength survey of 100 galaxy clusters at @xmath0 drawn from the rosat all sky survey cluster catalogues @xcite .",
    "the overall goal of the survey is to probe the relationship between the recent hierarchical infall history of clusters ( as revealed by strong and weak lensing observations ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the baryonic properties of the clusters .",
    "this results in two complementary aspects of the survey : mass - observable scaling relations @xcite , and evolution of cluster galaxy populations .",
    "both of these themes are connected by the aim of measuring and understanding the physical origin of the cluster - to - cluster scatter .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers about the first batch of 31 clusters observed by locuss , for which the following data have been gathered : wide - field subaru / suprime - cam imaging , _ hubble space telescope _",
    "wfpc2 and/or acs imaging of the cluster cores , wide - field _",
    "spitzer_/mips @xmath1 maps to match the half degree suprime - cam field of view , _ galex _ near- and far - ultraviolet ( nuv / fuv ) imaging , and wide - field near - infrared ( nir ) imaging obtained via a combination of ukirt / wfcam and kpno-4m / newfirm .",
    "we have also been awarded 500ksec on _ herschel _ as an open time key program to observe this sample at @xmath30 and @xmath31 with pacs .",
    "the galaxy evolution goals that we will tackle with these data include to measure robustly the scatter in the amount of obscured star formation in clusters at `` low '' redshift @xcite , and to cross - correlate the location of the obscured cluster galaxies with mass over - densities found in the weak - lensing mass maps derived from the subaru data @xcite .",
    "full details of the survey design will be given in a future paper , however here we emphasize that at the nominal redshift of our sample , @xmath32 , the suprime - cam field - of - view covers @xmath33 centred on each cluster .",
    "a @xmath34 @xcite dark matter halo has a virial radius of @xmath35 .",
    "our survey therefore probes out to @xmath36 the virial radius of the clusters .",
    "the uv and ir data discussed above all cover at least the same field of view as the subaru data .",
    "this survey is therefore sensitive to the infall regions of clusters studied recently by , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of abell 1758 ( a1758 ) at @xmath2 as a case study on the influence of cluster - cluster mergers on obscured star formation , and to outline the methods that will be applied to the full sample in future papers .",
    "a1758 was selected for this study because previous x - ray and lensing studies have identified it as a merging cluster , comprising two gravitationally bound components ",

    "the distribution of late - type galaxies ( whether detected or not at @xmath1 ) is less centrally concentrated than the distribution of early - type galaxies ; the radial distributions of @xmath1-detected and undetected late - type galaxies are consistent with the errors out to @xmath187 , however at larger radii there is an excess of @xmath1-detected galaxies over both early - types and passive spirals .",
    "this excess corresponds to the galaxies discussed above that are associated with galaxy groups detected in the out - skirts of the clusters in the weak - lensing map .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have studied a1758 in detail as a merging cluster using weak lensing and x - ray data respectively .",
    "in particular @xcite investigated the thermodynamics of both cluster components .",
    "here we compare our results on obscured star - formation in a1758 with the thermodynamics of the intracluster medium , and thus with the likely dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "@xcite found no evidence of compressional heating of the intracluster medium ( icm ) in the region between a1758n and a1758s , suggesting that the two clusters have not begun to merge with each other yet , although they may be gravitational bound to each other already .",
    "a1758n itself is interpreted as being a large impact parameter merger between two 7kev clusters , one cluster ( to the north - west ) currently moving to the north and the other ( to the south - east ) currently moving to the south - east .",
    "in contrast , the merger in a1758s is interpreted as having a much smaller impact parameter with the merger occurring close to the line - of - sight through the cluster .",
    "the core radii of the merging components within a1758n are @xmath188 ; in contrast the merging components of a1758s have core radii of @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "@xcite therefore suggested that , as a consequence of the differing impact parameters , the galaxies in the merging clusters of a1758s have experienced lower ram pressures than those in a1758n , and that a1758s may be at an earlier stage in its merger than a1758n .",
    "however , both a1758n and a1758s do contain regions of hotter gas that have presumably been shock - heated during the respective mergers .",
    "the precise timing difference between the two mergers is difficult to ascertain , however @xcite proposed that a1758n is seen significantly after the point of closest approach whilst a1758s may be seen at approximately the epoch of closest approach .",
    "okabe & umetsu s weak lensing mass map successfully resolves the two merging components of a1758n , and locates a single mass peak in the core of a1758s , both of which are consistent with david & kempner s interpretation of the x - ray data .",
    "how well do our mid - ir results fit with the x - ray and lensing results ?",
    "one of the most striking features of the distribution of obscured galaxies in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial ] is their absence from the central @xmath191 region of a1758s , in contrast to the same region in a1758n , especially in the vicinity of the south - east component of a1758n .",
    "this difference between the clusters is reminiscent of the large cluster - to - cluster scatter within the core regions of merging clusters found with _",
    "intense star formation can be triggered in cluster - cluster mergers by the passage of gas - rich galaxies through shocked regions of the icm @xcite . in a1758n the merger - induced shock - front(s )",
    "have dissipated @xcite , which helps to explain why shock - fronts are not found adjacent to the dusty galaxies in the core of that cluster .",
    "a1758s is claimed to be an earlier stage in the merging process , however @xcite did detect shock - heated gas in this cluster . therefore naively one would expect that star - formation would have been triggered by the shocks as in a1758n .",
    "however no @xmath1 sources are found in the central @xmath181 region of a1758s .",
    "the merger geometry of a1758s may help to explain the absence of obscured galaxies in its core .",
    "for example the @xmath1 sources at @xmath192 may have been scattered to large radii by the line - of - sight merger that is ongoing in the core of the cluster in a manner analogous to the distribution of cluster galaxies in cl0024 , another line - of - sight merger cluster @xcite . assuming that the galaxies are moving at @xmath193 it would take them @xmath194 to travel to a radius of @xmath195 from the centre of the cluster . on the face of it ,",
    "this is inconsistent with david & kempner s proposal that the sub - clusters in the a1758s merger are approximately at closest approach .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the @xmath1 data might be that the shocks in a1758s were not strong enough to trigger detectable star - formation in the cluster galaxies that passed though them .",
    "we also note that a1758s is much less optically rich than a1758n , so the absence of obscured activity in a1758s could simply be due to a1758s being a poorer cluster than a1758n .",
    "this is supported by fig .",
    "[ bo ] because the fraction of star - forming @xmath1-bright galaxies in both clusters is consistent within the errors .    in summary ,",
    "our mid - ir results are qualitatively consistent with the previous x - ray and lensing results .",
    "however the absence of obscured galaxies in the core of a1758s remains a puzzle .",
    "one possibility is that the galaxies were already gas - poor before the cluster merger , and hence had no available fuel to undergo new star - formation .",
    "our results confirm and extend the view formed from _",
    "iso _ that the cluster - to - cluster scatter in merging clusters is large , and likely related to the physical parameters of cluster mergers .",
    "the global sfr of a1758 estimated from the @xmath1 flux of photometrically selected members is @xmath128 , qualifying it as one of the most infrared active clusters studied to date .",
    "for example it is comparable with the most active cluster studied to date ",
    "cl0024 at @xmath196 with @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "globally this is unsurprising because a1758 contains two ongoing cluster - cluster mergers and one ( between a1758n and a1758s ) that may occur within a few gyr .",
    "however the picture is more subtle when considering the specific sfr ( @xmath198 ) and star - forming fraction of galaxies ( @xmath199  see figs .",
    "[ geach ]  &  [ bo ] respectively ) .",
    "cl0024 stands out in fig .",
    "[ geach ] as the most active cluster by a factor of @xmath200 in @xmath198 because of it s low mass relative to a1758 .",
    "on the other hand , cl0024 and a1758 have comparable values of @xmath201 ( fig .  [ bo ] ) , indicative of the clusters having comparable optical richness .",
    "this further underlines the conclusion that numerous parameters influence the level of obscured star - formation in galaxy clusters : merger geometry , density of the icm , location of shock - heated gas with respect to the cluster galaxies , the available supply of gas in cluster galaxies in which star - formation may be triggered by shock - heating of the icm , the optical richness of the cluster , and cluster mass .",
    "we will investigate these issues in detail with the full sample in a future paper .",
    "we find a significant population of passive spiral galaxies , defined empirically by @xmath182 , @xmath165 and @xmath202 .",
    "the radial distribution of these galaxies is intermediate in radial extent between the cluster early - types and the actively star - forming galaxies detected at @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] ) .",
    "if the radial extent of each distribution indicates the length of time that each population has on average spent in the cluster potential well , then the passive spirals have been accreted by a1758 less recently than the actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "a simple interpretation is therefore that the passive spirals were formerly actively forming stars and thus brighter at @xmath1 , i.e.  that there is an evolutionary path linking the dusty star - forming galaxies , passive spirals and cluster early - type galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite identified a significant population of passive spirals in cl0024 over a wide range of environments , and used a combination of _ galex _ uv photometry and optical spectroscopy to find that their star - formation quenching time - scales are often @xmath203 , suggestive more of starvation , although the rapid quenching expected for ram - pressure stripping was also observed .",
    "as the simulations of @xcite show , gas is lost from infalling galaxies over a wide range of environments ( even beyond the virial radius ) on both short and long time - scales , and @xcite estimate that the observed frequency and quenching time - scales of passive spirals in @xmath204 clusters could account for the entire build - up of s0s between @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "the relationship between moran et al.s uv / optical selected passive spirals and our optical / ir selected passive spirals is currently unclear .",
    "for example , the evolutionary path outlined above may not include the uv / optical passive spirals discussed by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the two populations of passive spirals are indeed the same class of object , then the evolutionary path may not be valid . in that case",
    "an alternative interpretation of the differing radial distributions of dusty and passive spirals could be that the physical processes that trigger star formation in the former population are more efficient at the largest radii than the processes that act to quench star formation in the latter population .",
    "the _ galex _ , _ spitzer _ , _ herschel _ , ground - based near - ir photometry and optical spectroscopy dataset that we are assembling on a large sample of clusters will be very powerful for disentangling the respective galaxy populations .",
    "we have presented the first results from our panoramic multi - wavelength survey of 31 clusters at @xmath207 clusters as part of the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss ; pi : g.  p.smith ) . for this initial study we chose a1758 ,",

    "we estimate there to be 10 lirgs within 3mpc of the cluster centre , comparable to the number in cl0024 .",
    "we identify just one possible cluster ulirg ( @xmath155 ) , which appears to be a merging galaxy system with a combined nir luminosity of @xmath211 .",
    "\\(iii ) we also convert the total cluster flux at @xmath1 to a total cluster star formation rate of @xmath212 .",
    "this is consistent within the errors with the most active cluster studied to date : cl0024 @xcite .",
    "we split the @xmath1 sources between the a1758n and a1758s based the proximity of each galaxy to the respective cluster centres , to obtain @xmath213 and @xmath214 respectively ",

    "\\(iv ) when the level of obscured activity is normalized to the mass and the optical richness of the cluster , then we find that the specific star - formation rate of a1758 is lower than that of cl0024 and that the fraction of cluster galaxies that are detected at @xmath1 is comparable with cl0024 .",
    "these results reflect the facts that a1758 is more massive than and of comparable richness to cl0024 .",

    "however in the core regions of each cluster we find that the central @xmath11 region of a1758n is comparatively rich in dusty galaxies in contrast to the absence of such objects in the same region of a1758s . this difference may be due to the differing recent dynamical histories of the two clusters , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "\\(vii ) finally , we identify a population of ir - selected passive spiral galaxies , i.e.  they have a late - type morphology and are undetected at @xmath1 .",
    "the radial distribution of these galaxies does not extend as far as that of the mips - detected population , suggesting that they were accreted into the cluster potential on average longer ago than the active dusty population .",

    "the next steps in this study are to repeat this analysis for a large ( @xmath215030 ) sample of clusters in order to measure for the first time the scatter in the infrared properties of clusters .",

    "<S> we present the first galaxy evolution results from the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss ) , a multi - wavelength survey of 100 x - ray selected galaxy clusters at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> locuss combines far - uv through far - ir observations of cluster galaxies with gravitational lensing analysis and x - ray data to investigate the interplay between the hierarchical assembly of clusters and the evolution of cluster galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> here we present new panoramic _ spitzer_/mips @xmath1 observations of the merging cluster abell 1758 at @xmath2 spanning @xmath3 and reaching a @xmath4 completeness limit of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate a global cluster star - formation rate of @xmath6 within @xmath7 of the cluster centre , originating from 42 galaxies with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the obscured activity in a1758 is therefore comparable with that in cl0024@xmath91654 , the most active cluster previously studied at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the obscured galaxies faithfully trace the cluster potential as revealed by the weak - lensing mass map of the cluster , including numerous mass peaks at @xmath1023mpcthat are likely associated with infalling galaxy groups and filamentary structures . </S>",
    "<S> however the core ( @xmath11 ) of a1758n is @xmath12 more active in the infrared than that of a1758s , likely reflecting differences in the recent dynamical history of the two clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the 24@xmath13 results from a1758 therefore suggest that dust - obscured cluster galaxies are common in merging clusters and suggests that obscured activity in clusters is triggered by both the details of cluster - cluster mergers and processes that operate at larger radii including those within in - falling groups . </S>",
    "<S> our ongoing far - uv through far - ir observations of a large sample of clusters should allow us to disentangle the different physical processes responsible for triggering obscured star formation in clusters .    </S>",
