    "over the past decade , cosmological observations have confirmed that the background expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon is usually explained by assuming the existence of a single dark - energy component , often modelled as a perfect fluid with a ( generally time - dependent ) equation - of - state parameter @xmath13 that results in it exhibiting a negative pressure .",
    "the simplest form of dark energy is a cosmological constant @xmath0 , which corresponds to a _ constant _ equation of state @xmath14 .",
    "together with cold dark matter , which is key to explaining the formation of structure in the universe , the cosmological constant gives rise to the standard @xmath0cdm model , which provides a good fit to existing cosmological observations .",
    "nonetheless , there have been a large number of other exotic forms of matter proposed to provide alternative explanations for the current accelerating universal expansion @xcite , including , for example , topological defects @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we remain focussed on the @xmath0cdm model , but with the inclusion of a second dark energy component , which is introduced ( in the first instance ) to allow the friedmann equation written in terms of conformal time @xmath4 to be form invariant under the reciprocity transformation @xmath15 of the universal scale factor @xcite .",
    "such an invariance is of general interest , but may be particularly relevant for penrose s recent ` cycles of time ' cosmological model @xcite , which posits a cyclic universe in which the ultimate infinitely expanded state of one phase ( or ` aeon ' ) is identified with the initial singularity of the next .    for a homogeneous and isotropic universe described by the friedmann ",
    "walker ( frw ) metric with curvature parameter @xmath16 , the friedmann equation describing the dynamical evolution of the scale factor @xmath17 can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hubble parameter ( the dot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmic time @xmath20 ) , and the energy density @xmath21 of each of the constituent components of the universe is taken into account through the corresponding present - day density parameter @xmath22 and its equation - of - state parameter @xmath23 , which we will assume throughout to be time - independent .    in the @xmath0cdm model , the total density parameter is usually taken to comprise of contributions from radiation ( @xmath24 ) , matter ( typically modelled as dust with @xmath25 ) , curvature ( @xmath26 ) , and the cosmological constant ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : omega ] , in which one can see an obvious ` gap ' that we term ` missing matter ' with @xmath28 .",
    "interestingly , forms of matter do exist for which @xmath28 , such as domain walls @xcite , or particular scalar field models @xcite .",
    ".equation - of - state parameters for different constituents of the universe .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to carry out the exploration of the parameter space , we first incorporate the extra component into the standard cosmological equations , by performing the minor modifications to the camb code @xcite described in section [ sec : pert ] ( which implement a parameterised post - friedmann ( ppf ) presciption for the dark energy perturbations @xcite ) .",
    "we then include into the cosmomc software @xcite a fully - parallelized version of the nested sampling algorithm multinest @xcite , which significantly increases the efficiency of calculating the bayesian evidence and also reliably produces posterior samples even from distributions with multiple modes and/or pronounced degeneracies between parameters .",
    "a suitable guideline for making qualitative conclusions has been laid out by jeffreys : if @xmath29 model @xmath30 should not be favoured over model @xmath31 , @xmath32 constitutes significant evidence , @xmath33 is strong evidence , while @xmath34 would be considered decisive .",
    "for comparison purposes , we first assume no additional component @xmath2 , in order to determine the constraints imposed by the current combined data sets on the standard @xmath0cdm model . in particular , we find the data indicate the dominance of dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant with @xmath35 , followed by matter density ( dark matter+ baryons ) @xmath36 , and an almost negligible spatial curvature @xmath37 .",
    "we also obtain the present hubble parameter @xmath38 .",
    "the constraints on the other parameters \\{@xmath39 } remain essentially unaffected by the introduction below of our additional component @xmath2 , and so we do not consider them further .",
    "the inclusion of a missing matter component @xmath2 with @xmath40 considerably broadens the parameter constraints .",
    "in particular , we find : @xmath41 , which constitutes an order - of - magnitude increase in the error bars as compared with the standard @xmath0cdm model , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "figure [ fig:3cdm ] shows 1d and 2d marginalised posterior distributions for the density parameters ( note that @xmath45 ) . as expected , we observe a clear degeneracy between @xmath46 and both @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the 1d constraint on the density parameter of missing matter is @xmath49 .",
    "the current data thus prefer a slightly negative value , which is difficult to interpret physically , although the 1d marginal shows moderate relative probability even for @xmath7 , and so the presence of an appreciable missing matter component can not be ruled out .",
    "our results are , however , still consistent with a standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "this view is supported by our bayesian model comparison .",
    "we find that the log - evidence difference ( or bayes factor ) between the missing matter model and the standard @xmath0cdm model is @xmath50 .",
    "according to jeffreys guideline @xcite , the inclusion of the missing matter component is therefore significantly disfavoured by current cosmological data .",
    "we now allow for the equation - of - state parameter @xmath8 for our additional component to be a free parameter ( albeit still independent of redshift ) , for which we assume a uniform prior in the range @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "we thus allow for the possibility that this second dark - energy component could be a form of phantom energy with @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : xcdm ] shows the resulting 1d and 2d marginalised posterior distributions for @xmath8 and the density parameters in the model ( once again , note that @xmath45 ) . at the top - right of the figure",
    "we also give a representation of the 3d posterior in the @xmath53 subspace , where the colour indicates the value of @xmath47 .",
    "the 1d constraints on the standard parameters are as follows : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the constraints on the parameters describing the additional , second dark - energy component may be given as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , although these numbers obscure the bi - modal nature of the marginal @xmath60-space and @xmath61-space distributions ( see below ) .",
    "these results are clearly consistent with a standard @xmath0cdm model , although the inclusion of the additional dark - energy component has again resulted in the uncertainties in the constraints on the standard parameters being much larger than those obtained assuming a @xmath0cdm model . indeed , the 1d marginal for @xmath46 shows moderate relative probability even for @xmath62 .    moreover , the 2d and 3d marginal distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : xcdm ] have some curious and interesting features that are worth noting .",
    "first , as might be expected , we again see a pronounced degeneracy between @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "of more interest , however , is the bi - modal nature of the 2d marginals in the @xmath63 and @xmath11 planes , both of which have a distinctive ` butterfly ' shape , albeit exhibiting opposite correlations .",
    "focussing on the latter , we see that the two peaks are offset from the standard @xmath0cdm model @xmath12 , although that model remains admissible .",
    "indeed , with the help of the 3d marginal in the @xmath53 subspace plotted in the top - right of figure  [ fig : xcdm ] , we see that the two modes of the distribution correspond to models with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the former model has the advantage that the density parameters for both dark energy components are positive , but requires the second component @xmath2 to be a form of phantom energy . in the latter model",
    ", the second dark energy component has a more physically reasonable value of @xmath8 , but is required to have a negative density parameter , which is difficult to interpret physically ( at least more so than a negative pressure ) .",
    "indeed , we see that this latter case is broadly consistent with our findings for the missing matter model discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the marginal distribution in @xmath70 subspace shows a strong correlation between these energy densities that would imply the potential for a trade - off between them .",
    "one might be concerned , however , that the marginal distribution plotted is strongly dominated by the contribution ( after marginalising over @xmath8 ) from near @xmath71 .",
    "if so , one could then not infer the potential of a trade - off between these two energy densities at ( any ) other values of @xmath8 . to investigate this possibility",
    ", we also calculated the conditional distributions in @xmath70 subspace for a small set of fixed @xmath8-values in the range @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "the resulting distributions were , however , very similar to that plotted in figure  [ fig : xcdm ] , and so indicating that the two energy densities can indeed be traded - off against one another .    also of interest",
    "is our bayesian model comparison , which finds that the log - evidence difference ( bayes factor ) between the double dark energy model and standard @xmath0cdm is @xmath73 .",
    "this shows that neither model is preferred over the other ; indeed they are indistinguishable to within the statistical uncertainty on the computed evidence values .",
    "thus , the two additional parameters @xmath46 and @xmath8 in the double dark energy model allow it the freedom to fit the data sufficiently better than @xmath0cdm to compensate for the corresponding increase in the prior volume , and hence the model is not penalised by the evidence .",
    "we have investigated the possibility that there exist two dark - energy components in the universe : a cosmological constant , with @xmath27 ; and an additional component @xmath2 with equation - of - state parameter @xmath8 . in the first instance",
    ", we fix the equation - of - state parameter of @xmath2 to the value @xmath40 .",
    "this ` missing matter ' model corresponds to the special case in which the additional component is _ required _ for the friedmann equation written in terms of conformal time @xmath4 to be form invariant under the reciprocity transformation @xmath74 . foregoing this requirement",
    ", we then consider the more general ` double dark energy ' model , in which @xmath8 is a free parameter assumed to have uniform prior in the range @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "for both models , we perform a bayesian parameter estimation and model selection analysis , relative to standard @xmath0cdm , using recent cosmological observations of cosmic microwave background anisotropies , type - ia supernovae and large scale - structure , together with constraints on the baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis and on the hubble parameter from the hubble space telescope key project .    for the missing matter model ,",
    "the introduction of the additional component @xmath2 significantly broadens the constraints on the standard parameters in the @xmath0cdm model , but leaves their best - fit values largely unchanged .",
    "the 1d marginalised constraint on the missing matter density parameter is @xmath49 .",
    "thus , current cosmological observations prefer a slightly negative value , which is difficult to interpret physically , but the posterior on this parameter is sufficiently broad that significant relative probability exits even for @xmath7 , and so the presence of a missing matter component can not be ruled out .",
    "nonetheless , our results are consistent with @xmath0cdm and our bayesian model selection analysis disfavours the missing matter model , as compared to @xmath0cdm , by about 1.5 log - units of evidence .    for the double dark energy model , the constraints on standard @xmath0cdm parameters are again considerably broadened .",
    "the 1d marginalised constraints on the second dark energy component are @xmath59 and @xmath75 , respectively , which are again consistent with @xmath0cdm .",
    "once more , however , the 1d marginalised posterior on @xmath46 is sufficiently broad that even @xmath76 is not ruled out .",
    "more interestingly , the 2d marginal distributions in the @xmath63 and @xmath11 planes are both bi - modal , exhibiting a ` butterfly ' shape .",
    "in particular , the peaks in the @xmath11-plane are offset from the @xmath0cdm value @xmath12 , although the latter is still acceptable .",
    "the two modes of the distribution correspond to models with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "we also find that the double dark energy model has a similar bayesian evidence to @xmath0cdm to within the numerical uncertainty , and hence neither model is preferred over the other .    to investigate the significance of the observed bimodality of the posterior",
    ", we performed simulated observations of the cmb power spectrum and type ia supernovae apparent brightness versus redshift , assuming a standard concordance @xmath0cdm model and observational data quality commensurate with the real cmb and supernovae data used in our analysis .",
    "these were combined with the same constraints on the baryon density from bbn @xcite and gaussian prior on @xmath83 from the hst key project @xcite that were used in the analysis of the real data .",
    "the resulting posterior distribution of the density parameters is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : xcdmsim ] .",
    "as one might expect , the 2d marginal distributions in the @xmath84 and @xmath11 planes do exhibit a characteristic ` plus ' shape , which is indicative of the parameter degeneracies along the coordinate axes .",
    "in contrast to the bimodal posterior obtained from the real data , however , we see that the analysis of simulated observations yields a unimodal posterior centred correctly on the input concordance parameters values .",
    "this suggests that the bimodal nature of the posterior in fig .",
    "[ fig : xcdm ] may be driven by features present in the real data , but absent from the @xmath0cdm simulation .",
    "since the double dark energy model remains viable with current cosmological observations , it is of interest to generalise it further .",
    "the bimodality we observe in figure  [ fig : xcdm ] might be evidence of contributions from two species @xmath2 and @xmath85 , with @xmath66 and @xmath86 .",
    "it might therefore be of interest to remove the requirement of having one fluid with @xmath27 and investigate if the value of either @xmath8 or @xmath87 settles near @xmath88 . also of interest would be to allow the equation - of - state parameter @xmath89 of the second dark energy component ( and possibly also of @xmath85 ) to depend on redshift @xcite .",
    "we plan to investigate these possibilities in a future work ."
