    "the formation process of these types of stars begins when the parent molecular cloud core undergoes gravitational collapse ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in the course of time , the collapsing core centre heats up due to compression , and ultimately becomes a protostar .",
    "the youngest low - mass protostars , characterised by accretion from the much more massive envelope ( @xmath18 ) , are known as the class  0 objects ( @xcite , 2000 ) .",
    "a curious example of a class  0 protostellar object is smm3 in the orion  b9 star - forming filament .",
    "this object was first uncovered by miettinen et al .",

    "perhaps more interestingly , the 350  @xmath19 m image revealed that smm3 hosts two subfragments ( dubbed smm3b and 3c ) on the eastern side of the protostar , where an extension could already be seen in the laboca map at 870  @xmath19 m .",

    "herschel _ images revealed that orion  b9 is actually a filamentary - shaped cloud in which smm3 is embedded ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "miettinen ( 2012b ) found that there is a sharp velocity gradient in the parent filament ( across its short axis ) , and suggested that it might represent a shock front resulting from the feedback from the nearby expanding hii region / ob cluster ngc  2024 ( @xmath22  pc to the southwest of orion  b9 ) .",
    "because smm3 appears to lie on the border of the velocity gradient , it might have a physical connection to it , and it is possible that the formation of smm3 ( and the other dense cores in orion  b9 ) was triggered by external , positive feedback ( @xcite ) .",
    "actually , the ob associations to the west of the whole orion  b cloud have likely affected much of the cloud area through their strong feedback in the form of ionising radiation and stellar winds ( e.g. @xcite ) . the column density probability distribution function of orion  b , studied by schneider et al .",

    "these observational and theoretical lifetime estimates are comparable to the fragmentation timescale of smm3 , which supports a scenario of the age of smm3 being a few times @xmath15  yr .    in the present paper , we have presented the first signatures of an outflow activity in smm3 .",

    "the fact that co molecules appear to be more heavily depleted towards the new line observation target position suggests that the degree of deuterium fractionation there is also higher .",
    "a possible manifestation of this is that the estimated dco@xmath5 abundance is higher by a factor of @xmath152 towards the core centre than towards the core edge , but this discrepancy could be partly caused by the different transitions used in the analysis ( @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively ) .",
    "recently , kang et al .",
    "( 2015 ) derived a deuterium fractionation of formaldehyde in smm3 ( towards the core centre ) , and they found a hdco / h@xmath2co ratio of @xmath33 , which is the highest value among their sample of 15 class  0 objects .",
    "this high deuteration level led the authors to conclude that smm3 is in a very early stage of protostellar evolution .",
    "besides the narrow ( @xmath9  km  s@xmath7 ) component of the _ p_-h@xmath2co@xmath60 line detected towards smm3 , this line also exhibits a much wider ( @xmath155  km  s@xmath7 ) component with blue- and redshifted wing emission .",
    "the other two transitions of _",
    "p_-h@xmath2co we detected , @xmath62 and @xmath61 , are also broad , more than 10  km  s@xmath7 in fwhm , and exhibit wing emission .",
    "the methanol line we detected , with a fwhm of 10.98  km  s@xmath7 , is also significantly broader than most of the lines we have detected .",
    "the similarity between the fwhms of the methanol and formaldehyde lines suggests that they originate in a common gas component . the rotational temperature derived from the _",
    "p_-h@xmath2co lines , @xmath8  k , is considerably higher than the dust temperature in the envelope and the gas temperature derived from ammonia .",
    "the large linewidths and the relatively warm gas temperature can be understood if a protostellar outflow has swept up and shock - heated the surrounding medium .    the h@xmath2co and ch@xmath4oh molecules are organic species , and they can form on dust grain surfaces through a common co hydrogenation reaction sequence ( @xmath156 or h@xmath4co or ch@xmath2oh or h@xmath2coh @xmath157 ; e.g. watanabe & kouchi 2002 ; @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) . the intermediate compound , solid formaldehyde , and the end product , solid methanol ,",
    "have both been detected in absorption towards low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ; pontoppidan et al .",

    "a more recent study of solid - phase ch@xmath4oh in low - mass ysos by bottinelli et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggests that much of the ch@xmath4oh is in a co - rich ice layer , which conforms to the aforementioned formation path .",
    "we note that h@xmath2co can also be formed in the gas phase ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the narrow _ p_-h@xmath2co line we detected is likely tracing a quiescent gas not enriched by the chemical compounds formed on dust grains .",
    "the estimated _",

    "in contrast , the fractional _",
    "p_-h@xmath2co abundance is found to be @xmath162 times higher for the broad component than for the narrow one .",
    "the origin of the h@xmath2co abundance enhancement in low - mass protostars can be understood in terms of the liberation of the ice mantles ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that there are also gas - phase formation routes for ch@xmath4oh , which start from the reaction between ch@xmath134 and h@xmath2o or between h@xmath4co@xmath5 and h@xmath2co .",
    "the resulting protonated methanol , ch@xmath4oh@xmath163 , can recombine with an electron and dissociate to produce ch@xmath4oh ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the gas - phase syntheses are not able to produce the high fractional abundances like observed here towards smm3 ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "the thermal desorption of ch@xmath4oh requires a dust temperature of at least @xmath165  k ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although highly uncertain , the h@xmath2co rotational temperature we derived does not suggest the dust temperature to be sufficiently high for ch@xmath4oh molecules to sublimate .",
    "hence , it seems possible that an outflow driven by smm3 has sputtered the icy grain mantles ( in impacts with gas - phase h@xmath2 and he ) so that h@xmath2co and ch@xmath4oh were released into the gas phase .",
    "on the other hand , the high co depletion factors we derived suggest that the grain ices are rich in co , and if ch@xmath4oh molecules are embedded in co - rich ice layers , their thermal evaporation temperature can be considerably lower ( @xmath166  k ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the _ p_-h@xmath2co / ch@xmath4oh column density ratio for the broad line component is found to be @xmath167 .",
    "this value represents a lower limit to the total h@xmath2co / ch@xmath4oh ratio , which depends on the _ o_/_p _ ratio .",
    "based on the observed abundances of both the _ ortho _ and _ para _ forms of h@xmath2co in low - mass dense cores , jrgensen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) derived a _",
    "o_/_p _ ratio of @xmath168 .",
    "the authors interpreted this to be consistent with thermalisation at 1015  k on dust grains .",
    "if we assume that the _ o_/_p _ ratio is @xmath169 , we obtain a total h@xmath2co / ch@xmath4oh column density ratio of @xmath170 , while for a _ o_/_p",
    "_ ratio , which is equal to the relative statistical weights of 3:1 , the total h@xmath2co / ch@xmath4oh ratio becomes @xmath171 .",
    "the h@xmath2co / ch@xmath4oh ice abundance ratio in low - mass ysos is found to be in the range @xmath172 ( @xcite ) , which is higher than the gas - phase abundance ratio towards smm3 .",
    "hence , it is possible that the ices are not completely sublimated into the gas phase . interestingly ,",
    "if the total h@xmath2co / ch@xmath4oh ratio for smm3 is @xmath173 , and @xmath174 , then these properties would resemble those derived for the galactic centre clouds where shocks ( caused by expanding bubbles , cloud - cloud collisions , etc . )",
    "are believed to have ejected the species from the grain mantles ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , for the hot interiors of class 0 sources , i.e. hot corinos , the h@xmath2co / ch@xmath4oh ratio is found to be higher , in the range @xmath175 ( @xcite ; their table  3 ) , which are comparable to the aforementioned ice abundance ratios . in hot corinos the dust temperature exceeds 100 k , and the evaporation of ice mantles is the result of radiative heating by the central protostar .",
    "moreover , in the horsehead photodissociation region ( pdr ) in orion  b , the h@xmath2co / ch@xmath4oh ratio is found to be @xmath176 ( @xcite ) .",
    "guzmn et al .",
    "( 2013 ) concluded that in the uv - illuminated pdr both h@xmath2co and ch@xmath4oh are released from the grain mantles through photodesorption .",
    "the so line we detected is narrow ( @xmath177  km  s@xmath7 ) , but low - intensity wing emission can be seen on both sides of it ( see @xcite for similar spectra towards the cb34 globule , which harbours a cluster of class 0 objects ) .",
    "the derived fractional abundance of so , @xmath178 , is very low , as for example the average abundance derived by buckle & fuller ( 2003 ) for their sample of class  0 objects is @xmath179 , and in the starless tmc-1 cloud the abundance is found to be @xmath125 ( @xcite ) .",
    "while our narrow so line is probably originating in the quiescent envelope , where so is formed through the reactions @xmath180 and @xmath181 ( e.g. @xcite ) , the weak line wings provide a hint of an outflowing so gas .",
    "the so emission is indeed known to be a tracer of protostellar outflows ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "outflow shocks can first release h@xmath2s molecules from dust grains , and subsequent hydrogenation reactions produce hs molecules and s atoms ( @xmath182 ; @xmath183 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the oxidation reactions @xmath184 and @xmath181 can then lead to the formation of so ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , lee et al . (",
    "2010 ) derived an so abundance of @xmath185 towards the hh211 jet driven by a class 0 protostar , which shows that a significant abundance enhancement can take place in low - mass outflows .",
    "some of the evolutionary models of the sulphur chemistry by buckle & fuller ( 2003 ) suggest that , after @xmath186 yr , the abundance of h@xmath2s starts to drop , which leads to a rapid decrease in the so abundance .",
    "this could explain the very weak so wing emission seen towards smm3 , and agrees with the observational estimates of the class 0 lifetime of about @xmath108 yr ( e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite for a comparable result from simulations ) .",
    "interestingly , some of the buckle & fuller ( 2003 ) models , for example the one with a gas temperature of 10  k , h@xmath2 density of @xmath15  @xmath187 , and a cosmic - ray ionisation rate of @xmath188 s@xmath7 , which is ten times the standard @xmath189 ( their fig .  7 , bottom left ) , predict so abundances comparable to that observed in smm3 ( a few times @xmath190 ) after @xmath15 yr , so perhaps the narrow - line component could also be ( partly ) tracing a gas component that was affected by outflows in the past",
    "we used the apex telescope to carry out follow - up molecular line observations towards the protostellar core smm3 , which is embedded in the filamentary orion b9 star - forming region .",
    "the new data were used in conjunction with our earlier apex data ( including saboca and laboca continuum data ) , and nh@xmath4 observations from the effelsberg 100  m telescope .",
    "the main results are summarised as follows .    1 .   from the observed frequency range @xmath45  ghz ,",
    "the following chemical compounds were identified : @xmath0co , c@xmath1o , so , _",
    "p_-h@xmath2co , and ch@xmath4oh - e@xmath3 .",
    "the last two species play a key role in the synthesis of more complex organic molecules and prebiotic chemistry , which makes them particularly interesting compounds in the gas reservoir of a solar - type protostar like smm3 .",
    "our new mapping observations of smm3 were performed in the frequency range @xmath64  ghz , from which dco@xmath75 and _ p_-h@xmath2co@xmath60 lines were identified .",
    "2 .   our revised sed analysis of smm3 supports its class 0 classification .",
    "the dust temperature , envelope mass , and luminosity were derived to be @xmath112  k , @xmath191  m@xmath17 , and @xmath192  l@xmath17 .",
    "the nh@xmath4-based gas kinetic temperature was derived to be @xmath89  k. the revised analysis of the subfragments seen in our saboca 350  @xmath19 m map suggests that smm3 went through a jeans - type fragmentation phase , where the initial density perturbations might have had contributions from both thermal and non - thermal motions .",
    "the co depletion factor derived from the new c@xmath1o data towards the core centre is very high , @xmath193 . , while that re - computed from our previous c@xmath87o data towards the core edge is clearly lower , @xmath194 .",
    "we also recalculated the degree of deuterium fractionation in the latter position , in terms of the n@xmath2d@xmath5/n@xmath2h@xmath5 ratio , and found a value of @xmath14 .",
    "even higher deuteration is to be expected towards the new line observation target position because of the stronger co freeze out .",
    "4 .   the new spectral - line mapping observations revealed that smm3 is associated with extended dco@xmath5 and _ p_-h@xmath2co emission ( as compared with the 350  @xmath19m - emitting region ) , and both the line emissions appear to be elongated in the east - west direction . besides the systemic velocity of @xmath195  km  s@xmath7 , emission from _",
    "p_-h@xmath2co@xmath60 was also detected at a radial velocity of 1.5  km  s@xmath7 , which concentrates to the east and northeast of smm3 , similarly to the spatial distributions of @xmath0co@xmath58 and c@xmath1o@xmath58 seen earlier by miettinen ( 2012b ) .",
    "the single - pointing observations showed that the @xmath196 line of _",
    "p_-h@xmath2co exhibits two components , a narrow one and a broad one .",
    "the other two _ p_-h@xmath2co lines we detected , @xmath197 and @xmath198 , are also broad .",
    "hence , a rotational diagram was constructed for the broad component of _",
    "p_-h@xmath2co , which yielded a rotational temperature of @xmath8  k. the detected methanol line has a width comparable to those of the broad formaldehyde lines , and is hence likely tracing the same warm gas component . 6 .",
    "we interpret the broad _ p_-h@xmath2co and ch@xmath4oh lines , and the elevated gas temperature , to be the first clear evidence of shock processing and outflow activity in smm3 .",
    "the abundance of _",
    "p_-h@xmath2co in the broad component is enhanced by two orders of magnitude with respect to the quiescent gas component .",
    "additionally , the protrusion - like emission feature seen in the _ spitzer _ 4.5  @xmath19 m image is likely related to shock emission .",
    "7 .   the detected so line shows a narrow component at the systemic velocity , and weak wings on both sides of it .",
    "the wing emission points towards a weak so outflow , while the narrow component is probably tracing the quiescent envelope .",
    "the estimated fragmentation timescale of smm3 , and the observed chemical characteristics all suggest that the age of smm3 is a few times @xmath15  yr , in agreement with its inferred class  0 evolutionary stage",
    ". a dedicated chemical modelling would be useful in setting tighter constraints on the source age .",
    "putting the results from the previous studies and the present one together , we are in a position to place smm3 in the wider context of class  0 objects .",
    "stutz et al . ( 2013 ) classified smm3 as a so - called pacs bright red source , or pbrs .",
    "this source population is composed of extreme , red class  0 objects with presumably high - density envelopes and high mass infall rates , and the median values of their mbb - based dust temperature , envelope mass , luminosity , and @xmath199 ratio are 19.6  k , 0.6  m@xmath17 , 1.8  l@xmath17 , and 2.7% ( see table  8 in s13 ) .",
    "although the physical properties of smm3 we have derived in the present work are more extreme than the typical pbrs properties ( it is colder , more massive , and more luminous ) , it can still be classified as a pbrs in agreement with s13 because this population was also found to contain sources with properties comparable to those we have derived .",
    "we note that the orion  b cloud appears to contain a relatively high fraction of pbrs - type objects ( 17% of the known protostars in orion",
    "b ) compared to that in orion  a ( 1% ; s13 ) .",
    "we can also draw a conclusion that smm3 exhibits a rich chemistry .",
    "it is possible that this class  0 protostellar core hosts a so - called hot corino where the gas - phase chemistry can be as rich as in the hot molecular cores associated with high - mass star formation .",
    "this can be tested through high resolution interferometric multi - line observations .",
    "such observations would also be useful to examine whether smm3 drives a chemically rich / active molecular outflow , as our detection of the broad formaldehyde and methanol lines already suggest . in a more general context of low - mass star formation",
    ", smm3 has the potential to become a useful target source of chemical evolution in a triggered star - forming region ( feedback from ngc  2024 , which could be ultimately linked to the nearby ori ob1 association within the ori - eri superbubble ) . by comparing its properties with those of class  0 objects in more isolated , quiescent regions ,",
    "it could be possible to investigate whether its ( chemical ) evolution could have been accelerated as a result of more dynamic environment .",
    "the observed fragmentation of the smm3 core indeed suggests that it has had a dynamical history , and is a fairly atypical object compared to the general class  0 population in the galaxy .",
