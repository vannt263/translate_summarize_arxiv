    "this paper is a sequential work of @xcite . for its characteristic properties ,",
    "quantum walks ( qws ) have attracted much attention of various fields , such as , quantum search algorithms @xcite , and topological insulators @xcite .",
    "owing to such applications of the qws , it is of great importance to study the qws both analytically and numerically , and indeed , many researchers have tried to investigate the asymptotic behaviors of qws from various viewpoints @xcite in the past decade . from the mathematical view points , two kinds of limit theorems for qws have been constructed so far .",
    "the one is localization theorem .",
    "localization is one of the typical properties of discrete - time qws , which was first studied by inui _",
    "@xcite both mathematically and numerically .",
    "the detailed definition of localization is found in @xcite for example .",
    "the other is the weak limit theorem whose typical expression is described as follows @xcite : there exist @xmath0 , and a rational polynomial @xmath1 such that @xmath2 where @xmath3 with @xmath4 we should note that the first term , dirac measure part in eq .",
    ", @xmath5 corresponds to localization , and the second term , absolutely continuous part , @xmath6 , corresponds to the ballistic spreading .",
    "we remark that eq .",
    "gives @xmath7 so far , the weak limit theorem of one - dimensional space - homogeneous qws , such as hadamard walk @xcite , grover walk @xcite , have been derived . in @xmath8 ,",
    "konno _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have first given the weak limit theorem for the typical inhomogeneous qws , taking advantage of the generating function of the weights of passages .",
    "the method permits the analysis only for the qws with one defect at the origin , whose quantum coins are the same both in positive and negative parts .",
    "recently , various kinds of methods have been constructed to investigate mathematically the asymptotic behavior of qws , such as the fourier analysis @xcite , the cgmv method @xcite , the stationary phase method @xcite , the path counting method @xcite , and the generating function method @xcite .",
    "we can expect to analyze various kinds of inhomogeneous qws by the generating function method , while the fourier analysis and stationary phase method are useful to study homogeneous qws .",
    "however , it has not been clear the types of qws that can be analyzed by the generating function method .",
    "we can also analyze inhomogeneous qws via the cgmv method , still the cgmv method allows only for the general discussion of localization properties for the typical qws in one dimension .",
    "the generating function method offers not only localization theorem , but also the weak limit theorem for qws . + by using the generating function method ,",
    "we focus on the ballistic behavior of `` the two - phase qw '' .",
    "it has been known that the two - phase qw is deeply related to the topological insurator which has attracted much attention recently of many physicists @xcite .",
    "hence we expect that the two - phase qw can be utilized to study the topological insurator as its mathematical model",
    ". therefore it would be greatly worth to study the mathematical aspects of the two - phase qw to exactly grasp the asymptotic behavior .",
    "our main result is the first application of the generating function method to the weak limit theorem of the two - phase qw . combaining the time - averaged limit measure @xcite with the result in this paper , we obtain the whole mathematical picture of the asymptotic behavior of our two - phase qw .",
    "+ the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath9 , we define the two - phase qw which is the main target in this paper , and present our main result . in section @xmath10 , we give the proof of theorem @xmath11 .",
    "for the general setting of discrete - time qw in one dimension , the walker has a coin state at position @xmath12 in each time @xmath13 described by a two - dimensional vector as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the set of complex numbers .    in this paper , we focus on a discrete - time qw with two phases in one dimension defined by the unitary matrices as follows : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "the time evolution is determined by the recurrence formula @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "we should note that @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to the left and right movements , respectively .",
    "the walker moves differently in positive and negative parts each other .",
    "hereafter , we call the qw `` the two - phase qw '' . putting @xmath23 ,",
    "the model becomes one - defect qw , which has been analyzed so far in detail @xcite .",
    "we should note that owing to the defect at the origin , the model has an origin symmetry , and the analysis becomes simple . we will report the analytical results of a qw with two phases which does not have defect at the origin in the upcoming paper .",
    "we derived localization theorems @xcite for the two - phase qw , in particular , the time - averaged limit and stationary measures .",
    "therefore , by obtaining the weak limit theorem corresponding to the ballistic spreading , we can mathematically express the whole picture of the asymptotic behavior of the two - phase qw with one defect .",
    "let @xmath24 be the summation of the time - averaged limit measure @xmath25 obtained by theorem @xmath9 in @xcite over all the positions @xmath26 , and @xmath27 be the quantum walker of the position at time @xmath13 .",
    "we should note that the time - averaged limit measure describes localization mathematically .",
    "now , we present the weak limit theorem for the missing part @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ weaklimit ] is given in section [ proof_theo ] .",

    "one of the interesting future problems is to show the relation in explicit between the topological insulator and the two - phase qw .      in this subsection",
    ", we see a concrete example of our result .",
