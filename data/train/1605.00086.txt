    "in recent years time - changed stochastic processes ( tcsp ) are getting increasing attention . note that a tcsp are obtained by changing the time of a stochastic process by some other process which is generally a non - decreasing lvy process called also subordinator .",
    "we mention , a lvy process has stationary and independent increments with cdlg sample paths .",
    "tcsp are used for example in finance to provide stochastic volatility models @xcite .",
    "further , they are also used in statistical physics to model anomalous diffusion phenomena @xcite .",
    "tcsp are convenient way to develop a model where it is desired to retain some properties of the outside process ( called also external process ) and at the same time it is required to change other characteristics .",
    "tcsp are also called some time subordinated stochastic processes .",
    "the idea of subordination was introduced in 1949 by bochner @xcite and expounded in his book in @xcite .",
    "the theory of subordinated processes is also explored in details in @xcite .",
    "the subordinated processes were studied in many areas of interest , for example in finance @xcite , physics @xcite , ecology @xcite , hydrology @xcite and biology @xcite .",
    "+ the long - range dependence ( lrd ) phenomena , called also long memory , first was introduced by mandelbrot and wallis in 1968 @xcite . since that time",
    "the models and processes which exhibit long memory property have found many practical applications .",
    "moreover , number of research papers related to this phenomena are increasing rapidly .",
    "one of the most classical model used to describe data sets with lrd is the fbm @xcite which is closely related to fractional langevin equation motion @xcite and is a generalization of the classical brownian motion .",
    "it is worth to mention , the fbm is also one of the main model used for description of data with anomalous diffusion behavior .",
    "one can observe lrd in many real data , for example , economic and financial time - series @xcite , physics and natural sciences data @xcite , as well as hydrology , meteorology and geophysics time series @xcite . in @xcite",
    "one can find additional interesting examples of long - range dependent time series , like single particle tracking dynamics in molecular biology , electromagnetic field data or high solar flare activity .",
    "the lrd relates to the rate of decay of statistical dependence of two points with increasing lag or spatial distance between the points .",
    "a phenomenon is usually considered to have lrd if the dependence decays more slowly than an exponential decay , typically a power - like decay .",
    "what should be mentioned , lvy processes can not model data that exhibits lrd and most of lrd data come very often from non - gaussian distributions . + to keep these requirements in mind",
    ", we study fbm time - changed by gamma and inverse gamma process . by changing the time of fbm with gamma and inverse gamma stochastic processes ,",
    "our aim is to retain the lrd property of fbm and to introduce heavy - tailedness and time varying volatility .",
    "note that gamma process is a lvy process with increments having gamma distribution while the inverse gamma process is the first - exit time of gamma process .",
    "it is worth to mention here that there is an inverse gamma lvy process proposed in literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) however it is different from definition given in this paper .",
    "the first analyzed process , known also as the fractional laplace motion ( flm)@xcite , can be useful for modeling data having lrd property and non - gaussian behavior .",
    "the density of flm is not gaussian , however , it exhibits many properties of gaussian - based processes , like existence of moments .",
    "the second considered process can be used for data with lrd and visible constant time periods characteristic . + like fbm , the processes time - changed by inverse subordinators are considered as models adequate for anomalous diffusion phenomena . in the domain of anomalous diffusion the typical approach",
    "is based on continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) @xcite , and the subordinated lvy process can be considered as a scaling limit of ctrw @xcite . the main point in framework of ctrw and subordination technique is distribution of waiting - times , which correspond to observed constant time periods @xcite . in recent years number of papers devoted to this issue have grown rapidly .",
    "we only mention , for instance an inverse @xmath0stable subordinator was considered in @xcite , the inverse tempered stable subordinator was examined in @xcite , while the inverse gamma process as a time - change was mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the general case inverse subordinators based on infinite divisible processes were explored for example in @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we present the main properties of gamma and inverse gamma processes , like tail behavior and structure of dependence .",
    "we also proved the main characteristics of fbm time - changed by these processes .",
    "although the flm was examined in @xcite , here we mention the properties of it in order to compare with the appropriate characteristics of fbm delayed by inverse gamma subordinator .",
    "we concentrate on the density functions of both processes , asymptotic behavior of moments and the covariance structures to establish the lrd property for both process under study .",
    "moreover , we indicate that both systems can be classified as anomalous diffusive .",
    "+ in this paper we also present the simulation procedures for both considered time - changed processes .",
    "the procedures are based on the fact that the analyzed systems are superpositions of two independent processes .",
    "further , we also propose parameters estimation schemes for both processes . note that estimation of flm parameters are not discussed in @xcite .",
    "estimation techniques are different in both cases . for the flm we use the fact that the mean square displacement ( msd ) has the same asymptotic behavior as for the fbm , therefore",
    ", we estimate the hurst exponent by using this measure .",
    "the parameter corresponding to gamma process are estimated using asymptotic behavior of the tail of flm .",
    "for the fbm time - changed by inverse gamma process we use visible constant time periods observed in the trajectories of considered process .",
    "the waiting times observable in the data constitute sample of independent random variables with gamma distribution . in order to estimate the parameter of this distribution we use here a new method based on the rescaled modified cumulative distribution function introduced in @xcite which is very effective for rounded data like waiting times .",
    "the effectiveness of estimation procedures is checked by using simulated trajectories of considered processes .",
    "the obtained results indicate those methods can be used for real data which has similar properties as theoretical models .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ def ] we introduce two considered processes , namely time - changed fbm by gamma and inverse gamma processes .",
    "next , in section [ theory ] we present the main properties of gamma process , inverse gamma process and both time - changed processes . in section [ sim ]",
    "we explain how to simulate the trajectories of both time - changed processes while in section [ est ] we provide step by step procedures of estimation of their parameters .",
    "last section contains conclusions .",
    "in this section we present the model , which is constructed as the superposition of two independent mechanisms , namely the fbm and other process that replaces the time . here",
    "we present two processes that are considered as the `` operational time '' of fbm , namely the gamma process and the first - exit time of gamma process .",
    "the last one we call the inverse gamma process .",
    "we should mention here that in the literature there is considered an inverse gamma lvy process , see e.g. @xcite which is different from the definition of inverse gamma process used in this paper .",
    "+ fbm is one of the most important model considered as the fractional dynamical system .",
    "it is well known that this process has self - similarity property and its increments exhibit behavior adequate to long - range dependent systems . moreover , very often it is considered as a main model appropriate for description of so called anomalous diffusion phenomena .",
    "it is worth mentioning that anomalous diffusion property of given process can be recognized by msd . for a sample @xmath1 with stationary increments msd",
    "is defined as follows @xcite @xmath2 the msd for sample being a realization of stationary increments process has the property @xmath3 where @xmath4 means equivalence in law .",
    "we classify the process with @xmath5 as exhibiting linear dynamics .",
    "if @xmath6 , the process may be described as featured by sub - linear dynamics ( sub - diffusive process ) , and consequently @xmath7 points at the super - linear dynamics ( super - diffusive ) of the stochastic process @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention , if the sample comes from the h - self similar lvy stable process ( i.e. process with stationary increments with @xmath0stable distribution and h - self similar property ) , then the @xmath8 parameter in ( [ power ] ) is equal to @xmath9 , @xcite .",
    "the anomalous diffusion phenomena can also be expressed in language of second moment of given process .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath10 is non - linear function of time , then we call the @xmath11 process as anomalous diffusive .",

    "we divide the analyzed time series into two vectors .",
    "the first one ( vector @xmath209 ) represents lengths of constant time periods observed in the data which means the number of consecutive observations that are on the same level . according to the idea of constructing the inverse subordinators",

    "the main issue during estimation of parameters corresponding to distribution of constant time periods comes from the fact that the exact waiting time is unknown and usually comes from continuous distribution .",
    "for example , if we observe that a character of the process has changed after 3 units of time , it is not known at which point of time the change actually happened , the correct value lies in the interval ( 2 , 4 ) . due to this fact the modified version of cumulative distribution function was introduced . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that the distance between empirical cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of waiting times from given distribution and rescaled modified distribution function is smallest according to the distance between empirical cdf and the theoretical cdf of given distribution .",
