    "collisions with alkali metal atoms as targets have been studied in numerous experimental and theoretical works over many years . among these studies",
    "a number of efforts deal with proton  alkali metal atom collisions @xcite and a smaller number of attempts address collisions including antiprotons as projectiles @xcite .",
    "one reason for the attractivity of alkali metal atoms is that they are relatively easy to access experimentally as well as theoretically which opens up the possibility for detailed comparisons .",
    "the given shell structure of the alkali metals suggests in a theoretical description the application of a quasi - one - electron model for the outermost loosely bound electron .",
    "the electron is then described by means of a model potential formed by the coulomb potential of the nucleus and an effective potential representing the frozen inner - shell electrons . in particular , li and na atoms colliding with protons and electrons have been in the focus of the investigations so far . whereas the literature on alkali metal atoms collisions dealing with antiprotons as projectile is still sparse compared to the treatment of protons and electrons . in order to obtain cross sections for ionization of li by antiproton impact",
    "a continuum - distorted - wave eikonal - initial - state model has been used by mccartney et al .",
    "furthermore , an optical - potential description of collisions of antiprotons with li and na has been provided by stary et al .",
    "no experimental data are available for the considered antiproton ",
    "alkali metal atom collision systems yet due to the lack of appropriate low - energy antiproton sources",
    ". this may also be the reason for the relatively small interest in antiproton ",
    "alkali metal collisions compared to their proton counterparts until now .",
    "however , the upcoming facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) with its incorporated facility for low energy antiproton and ion research ( flair ) @xcite will provide the necessary experimental conditions in the near future and is therefore expected to attract further attention to the field of antiproton collisions .",
    "the primary motivation of this work is to shed more light on the antiproton ",
    "alkali metal collision systems and to provide a consistent data base for li(2s ) , na(3s ) and k(4s ) atom collisions with antiprotons and protons in a large energy range .",
    "it starts at low energies @xmath0kev where the collision processes depend considerably on the projectile and ranges up to high energies @xmath1kev where the antiproton and proton collision systems are supposed to show the same behavior due to the expected applicability of the first born approximation .",
    "the calculations for collisions with proton projectiles are considered to be valuable in two aspects . on the one hand ,",
    "the proton results  especially for li targets  can be compared in detail with literature values . this way the proton results can be utilized in order to test the present method and its implementation which is the same for protons and antiprotons .",
    "furthermore , new theoretical ionization and excitation cross sections for proton collisions  especially for k targets  are provided which to the authors knowledge were not fully known in the energy range considered here .    besides the obvious similarities of protons and antiprotons as projectiles they differ mostly in their capture behavior .",
    "first , only antiprotons can annihilate with protons of the atomic nucleus . since it is known that the process of annihilation is only likely to occur at very low energies @xcite it is not included in this investigation .",
    "second , in the case of proton collisions electron capture by the projectile from the target atom is possible .",
    "this process plays a dominant role for low - energy collisions .",
    "hence , a two - center approach appears to be most promising for low - energy proton collisions .",
    "however , at low energies the present calculations concentrate on antiproton collisions only .",
    "therefore , a basis expansion which is centered solely on the target alkali metal atom for both antiproton and proton projectiles is used .",
    "thereby , limitations pertinent to a molecular approach at high energies are avoided .",
    "furthermore , the same method can be used for antiproton and proton collisions which may be confirmed by a detailed comparison of present proton results with literature data .",
    "a detailed analysis of the electron capture process for proton scattering , however , lies beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec . [",
    "sec : method ] explains how the alkali metal atoms are described and reports on the computational approach .",
    "[ sec : results ] considers the convergence behavior of the present antiproton and proton results .",
    "subsequently , the calculated cross sections are presented and compared to literature data . finally , the present results for antiproton  alkali metal collisions are discussed and a comparison with a hydrogen atom as target is made .",
    "[ sec : summary ] concludes on the present findings .",
    "atomic units are used unless it is otherwise stated .",
    "in this work the target atoms are treated as effective one - electron atoms .",
    "the valence electron is exposed to a model potential @xmath2 suitable for alkali metal atoms which describes its interaction with the nucleus as well as with the remaining core electrons .",
    "additionally , core polarization effects are included .",
    "the employed model potential was proposed by klapisch @xcite .",
    "the used potential parameters are given in @xcite .",
    "the effect of the spin - orbit coupling is not included in the present approach .",
    "the energies of the states with principal quantum number @xmath3 for the alkali metal atoms li , na and k which were achieved with this approach are given in table [ tb : binding - energies ] together with compiled values of the nist data bank @xcite .",
    "in the case of energy level splitting due to spin - orbit coupling the present energies are compared to the lower lying reference energies .",
    "the largest relative energy splittings of the reference data due to the spin - orbit coupling of the energies given in table [ tb : binding - energies ] are 0.002% , 0.1% and 0.4% for the energetically lowest lying p states of li , na and k , respectively . particularly for li",
    "there is a very good agreement with the data given by nist . but also for the other two atoms the deviation from the literature values remains at maximum around one per cent .",
    ".calculated binding energies ( hartree ) for li , na and k using a klapisch - model potential .",
    "the reference data is taken from the nist data tables @xcite . in the case of energy level splitting due to spin - orbit coupling only the energetically lower lying reference energy",
    "is given.[tb : binding - energies ] [ cols=\"^ , < , < , < \" , ]     a linear decrease of the ionization cross section for all three alkali metal atoms can be observed on a doubly - logarithmic scale for high energies @xmath4 for protons as well as for antiprotons .",
    "therefore , the general fit formula @xmath5 for ionization cross sections in this energy range can be proposed , where @xmath6 is the ionization cross section for an arbitrary @xmath7 in the range @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a fit parameter which gives the slope of the linear curve on a doubly - logarithmic scale . the fit parameters which may be proposed for the three alkali metals colliding with protons",
    "are given in table [ tb : fit - parameter ] .",
    "the fits for na and k reveal a direct proportionality between the ionization cross section and the inverse of the energy , @xmath10 in the considered high energy regime .",
    "this proportionality holds approximately also for the present li ionization cross section .",
    "the proposed fits which are also shown in figures [ fig : cs_li_l10_p]a , [ fig : cs_na_l10_p]a and [ fig : cs_k_l10_p]a match well with the calculated ionization cross sections for @xmath11kev .",
    "these fits obtained for the proton case are also shown in figures [ fig : cs_li_l8]a , [ fig : cs_na_l8]a and [ fig : cs_k_l8]a in order to compare them with the antiproton ionization cross sections .",
    "it can be seen that the proton fits match remarkably well with the antiproton ionization results for energies higher than 150kev .",
    "therefore , the antiproton ionization cross sections also decrease proportional to @xmath12 where this proportionality again holds only approximately for li targets .",
    "this means that for energies higher than 150kev no specific features are expected for antiproton ionization cross sections with the considered alkali metal atoms . and",
    "in turn for these energies the treatment of proton collisions should be sufficient which is especially in the case of experimental studies less demanding .    .",
    "the ratios of the ionization and excitation cross sections for the target atoms li(2s ) , na(3s ) and k(4s ) are given .",
    "[ fig : cs_cmp_ap_p ] , scaledwidth=49.0% ]    however , both systems differ strongly regarding ionization for energies lower than 100kev due to the electron capture process which is only possible for protons .",
    "the proton cross section is strongly enhanced which can also be seen in figure [ fig : cs_cmp_ap_p ] . the maxima of the proton and antiproton ionization cross sections approximately at 45 and 10 [ in @xmath13 , respectively , for li targets differ by a factor 4.5 .",
    "the ionization maxima for na and k targets differ approximately by a factor 5.5 and 6.5 , respectively .",
    "the maxima are all located between 4 and 6kev where the proton maxima tend to occur at lower energies than the corresponding antiproton maxima .    a comparison of the present excitation cross sections for proton and antiproton collisions yields that they also agree for high energies @xmath14kev .",
    "the antiproton maximum for li targets lies around 10kev and is 10% lower than for proton collisions .",
    "the antiproton maxima for na and k are situated at approximately 15kev with @xmath15 smaller values than for the proton case .",
    "but below their maxima the na and k excitation curves for antiprotons and protons excitation cross section have comparable values .",
    "the most striking feature of figure [ fig : cs_cmp_ap_p ] is that the ratios of the proton to antiproton ionization cross sections increase strongly for low - energy collisions while the ratios for excitation only vary comparably weakly around 1 . in the case of ionization",
    "the electron capture channel becomes important for low - energy proton collisions leading to large ionization cross sections compared to antiproton collisions . in the case of excitation for both projectiles",
    "the same channels are open .",
    "it can be concluded for the antiproton cross sections that the present results complement and improve the existing data on antiproton  alkali metal atom collisions . while the excitation cross sections are comparable for proton and antiproton projectiles the proton ionization cross sections are strongly enhanced at low energies due to electron capture . for high energies",
    "@xmath14kev proton and antiproton collisions with li , na and k result in the same ionization cross sections which decrease proportional to @xmath12 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]   , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in figure [ fig : cs_cmp_l8]a the ionization cross sections for the three alkali metal atoms li , na and k colliding with antiprotons are plotted together with the high - energy fits extracted earlier from the proton calculations .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the cross sections for these atoms is similar in the whole energy range .",
    "all curves converge to their corresponding proton results for energies @xmath11kev which lie close to each other .",
    "the differences between the heights of the ionization cross sections for @xmath16kev as well as the ordering of the curves may be explained by the different ionization energies : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 which can also be found in table [ tb : binding - energies ] .",
    "all maxima lie around 4 to 6kev which is somewhat below the average velocity of the valence electrons and have far lower values compared to the proton collision systems . in figure",
    "[ fig : cs_cmp_l8]b the total excitation cross sections for the three alkali metals are compared .",
    "although the overall behavior of their excitation cross sections are similar they differ in detail . on an absolute scale",
    "the values of the antiproton excitation maxima for the three atoms differ considerably [ in @xmath20@xmath21 : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , i.e. , the maximum for k is 66% higher than that for na .",
    "this can be made plausible by comparing the energy differences of the ground states to the first excited states : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 since the @xmath28 transition is the dominant excitation channel .",
    "the cross sections for ionization and excitation of the hydrogen atom by antiproton impact were also calculated which are presented in figure [ fig : cs_cmp_l8 ] , too .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the hydrogen cross sections is comparable to those of the alkali metal atoms reflecting the shell structure of the alkali metal atoms with an outer valence electron in an s state .",
    "however , the absolute values of the cross sections differ clearly .",
    "first , the cross sections for hydrogen are much smaller due to the tighter binding of the electron which leads to a higher ionization energy and a smaller spacial extension .",
    "second , the maxima are shifted to higher impact energies which can be explained by the higher average velocity of the electron in the ground state of hydrogen . for high energies ( @xmath29kev )",
    "the ionization cross section of hydrogen seem to approach those of the alkali metal atoms . at these energies the ionization cross section of hydrogen",
    "is expected to decrease like @xmath30 .",
    "time - dependent close - coupling calculations of ionization and excitation cross sections for antiproton and proton collisions with the alkali metal atoms li(2s ) , na(3s ) and k(4s ) have been performed in a wide energy range from 0.25 to 1000kev .",
    "the target atoms are treated as effective one - electron atoms using a model potential .",
    "the total wave function is expanded in an one - center approach in eigenfunctions of the one - electron model hamiltonian of the target atom .",
    "the radial part of the basis functions is expanded in b - spline functions and the angular part in a symmetry - adapted sum of spherical harmonics .",
    "the collision process is described in the classical trajectory approximation . in the present calculations the results converged faster for collisions involving antiprotons than protons , faster for high than for low energies and faster for excitation than for ionization .",
    "good agreement with literature data has been achieved for the proton  alkali metal atom cross sections for @xmath31kev . however , for antiproton ",
    "alkali metal atom collisions literature data are sparse .",
    "the comparison to the calculations of antiproton collisions with li and na by stary et al .  shows the same disagreement with the present findings as it was found for their proton collision results . in view of this disagreement with literature data for proton collisions",
    "it can be stated that the calculations by stary et al .  were either not fully converged or the assumed conditions not fulfilled . to the best of the authors knowledge",
    "the first cross sections for p - k collisions in the considered energy range are presented .",
    "the ionization cross sections for protons and antiprotons differ considerably for energies smaller than 100kev due to the electron capture process which is only possible for protons and is the dominant ionization channel at low energies .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the antiproton cross sections is comparable for all three alkali metal atoms but differs in the absolute values depending on the atom - specific ionization and excitation energies . a comparison with hydrogen as target atom yields the same characteristics as for the alkali metals due to the common s state structure .",
    "however , the cross sections of hydrogen have much lower values and the hydrogen ionization and excitation maxima are shifted to higher impact energies because of the tightly bound 1s electron . for the proton ionization cross sections",
    "a simple fit formula is proposed for the energy range from 150 to 1000kev which also describes the properties of the antiproton ionization cross sections in this energy range well .",
    "the fit reveals that the ionization cross sections decrease proportional to @xmath12 in this energy range ."
