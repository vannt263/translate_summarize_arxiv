    "in recent years , a variety of new theoretical and phenomenological approaches of the glass transition ( e.g. , @xcite ) stimulated new experimental investigations especially of the high - frequency dynamics of glass - forming liquids @xcite .",
    "maybe the most controversially discussed theoretical approach of the glass transition is the mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite , which explains the glass transition in terms of a dynamic phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath0significantly above the glass temperature @xmath1 . for frequencies in the ghz - thz region",
    ", mct predicts an additional contribution , now commonly termed fast @xmath2-relaxation .",
    "this frequency region was mainly investigated by neutron and light scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "but recently , by combining various techniques , our group was able to obtain continuous dielectric spectra on glass - forming liquids extending well into the relevant region @xcite . for glass - forming glycerol and propylene carbonate , spectra covering 18 decades of frequency and extending well into the thz range",
    "were obtained @xcite .",
    "glycerol is a rather strong @xcite hydrogen - bonded glass - former with a fragility parameter of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , propylene carbonate ( pc ) can be characterized as a fragile ( @xmath4 , @xcite ) van der waals liquid . in the present paper",
    "we present a comparison of the results on both materials . for the experimental details the reader",
    "is referred to our earlier publications @xcite .",
    "figure [ figeps2 ]    shows the @xmath5-spectra for glycerol and pc in the whole accessible frequency range .",
    "@xmath6 exhibits the typical asymmetrically shaped @xmath7-relaxation peaks shifting through the frequency window with temperature .",
    "the data agree with the results of earlier dielectric investigations @xcite which were restricted to smaller frequency and temperature ranges .",
    "the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ figeps2 ] are fits of the @xmath8-relaxation region with the empirical cole - davidson function @xcite . a good fit of the peak region was achieved .",
    "the temperature dependence of the parameters of the cd function , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 @xmath12 @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ figcdfipa ] .    in most respects ,",
    "the results are in accord with previously published data @xcite extending them to lower or higher temperatures .",
    "@xmath13 can be parameterized using the vogel - fulcher - tamman ( vft ) equation , @xmath14 $ ] with @xmath15 @xmath16 k , @xmath17 for pc and @xmath18 k , @xmath19 for glycerol [ dashed lines in figs . [",
    "figcdfipa](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "the values of the strength parameter @xmath20 characterize pc as fragile and glycerol as intermediate in angell s classification scheme @xcite . at high temperatures small deviations from vft behavior",
    "show up , similar to those seen in earlier work @xcite . the simplest version of mct , the idealized mct @xcite , predicts a critical behavior of the @xmath7-relaxation timescale , @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the power law exponents of the @xmath25-minimum ( see below ) .",
    "the solid lines in figs . [ figcdfipa](a ) and ( b ) are fits with the mct prediction with @xmath26 @xmath27 k for pc and @xmath28 @xmath29 k for glycerol , fixed to the values obtained from the analysis of the @xmath30-minimum ( see below ) .",
    "only the data above 200 k for pc and above 280 k for glycerol have been used for the fits which led to a good agreement in this temperature region . for lower temperatures deviations",
    "this can be understood within the extended mct @xcite where the structural arrest found in idealized mct for @xmath31is overcome by the introduction of thermally activated hopping processes .",
    "for both materials , the width parameter @xmath32 [ figs . [ figcdfipa](c ) and ( d ) ] increases linearly below about 200 k for pc and 300 k for glycerol . for @xmath33 , mct predicts a temperature independent spectral form of the @xmath34-process .",
    "indeed , a tendency to saturate is seen for @xmath32 in figs . [ figcdfipa](c ) and ( d ) , however at temperatures somewhat above @xmath35 , only . but a reasonable description of the @xmath34-peaks for @xmath33 is also possible with a constant @xmath36 for glycerol @xcite and @xmath37 for pc .",
    "the @xmath38 of pc and glycerol [ figs . [ figcdfipa](e ) and ( f ) ] both decrease with temperature . according to mct , @xmath39 should be temperature independent for @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath40 , @xmath41^{\\frac12}$ ] follows from extended mct . in figs . [ figcdfipa](e ) and ( f ) the lines were calculated using the mct prediction .",
    "the agreement of fits and data israther poor , but due to the large experimental uncertainties no definite conclusion can be drawn .",
    "at least it seems that @xmath42 assumes a weaker temperature dependence above @xmath35 .    at frequencies about 2 - 3 decades above the peak frequency , for both materials",
    "an excess wing shows up as power law , @xmath43 with @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ figeps2 ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath24 decreases with decreasing temperature as found previously for various glass - forming materials @xcite . for pc , at 203 k and for glycerol at 272 k , the excess wing has merged with the @xmath34-peak .",
    "the excess wing seems to be a universal feature of glass - forming liquids @xcite but , up to now , no consensus concerning its microscopic origin was achieved . for a more detailed treatment of the excess wing in glycerol and pc ,",
    "see @xcite .    at frequencies in the ghz - thz range ,",
    "@xmath5 exhibits a minimum for both materials @xcite . a magnified view is given in fig .",
    "[ figmct ] .    clearly this minimum is too shallow to be described by a simple superposition of @xmath34-peak ( or excess wing ) and boson peak @xcite .",
    "near 1 thz , for both materials the fir measurements reveal a peak or shoulder , that can be ascribed to the boson peak , well known from light and neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "both materials exhibit a significantly different behavior in the region between minimum and boson peak : for pc only one power law , @xmath45 , is seen at frequencies @xmath46 forming simultaneously the high frequency wing of the @xmath47-minimum and the low frequency wing of the boson peak . for @xmath48 , a linear behavior is approached as indicated by the dash - dotted lines in figs . [ figeps2](a ) and [ figmct](a ) . in marked contrast , for glycerol two regimes can be distinguished : just above @xmath49 , there is a rather shallow increase of @xmath50  but at higher frequencies a very steep increase appears , approaching @xmath51 for @xmath48 [ dash - dotted lines in figs .",
    "[ figeps2](b ) and [ figmct](b ) ] .    for both materials",
    ", the @xmath5-spectra between @xmath34- and boson peak can be described by the phenomenological ansatz @xmath52 ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ figeps2 ] ) .",
    "the first term takes account of the high - frequency wing of the @xmath34-peak with the parameters chosen to achieve a smooth transition to the cd - fits .",
    "the second term describes the excess wing . in order to explain the shallow minimum , a constant loss term , @xmath53 , as proposed by wong and angel @xcite and a @xmath54 increase were assumed .",
    "both contributions seem to be universal features in the high - frequency response of glassy ionic conductors @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath55 power law , with @xmath56 takes account of the low frequency wing of the boson peak . in this way , quite impressive fits over 17 decades of frequency are possible .",
    "of course this could be expected considering the large amount of parameters , but nevertheless it can not be fully excluded that such a simple superposition ansatz is correct .",
    "mct predicts for the minimum region significant contributions from the fast @xmath57-process . within idealized mct , above @xmath35",
    ", the minimum region can be approximated by the interpolation formula @xcite @xmath58/(a+b)$ ] . here",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 denote frequency and amplitude of the minimum , respectively .",
    "the exponents @xmath23 and @xmath24 are temperature independent and constrained by @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the gamma function .",
    "this implies @xmath63 , i.e. a significantly sublinear increase of @xmath64 at @xmath65 is predicted . for pc ,",
    "a consistent description of the @xmath66-minima at @xmath67 k is possible with @xmath68 ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xcite [ solid lines in fig . [ figmct](a ) ] .",
    "the obtained @xmath71 is consistent with the results from other measurement techniques @xcite .",
    "the fits provide a good description of the data up to the boson - peak frequency .",
    "quite a different behavior is seen in glycerol [ solid lines in fig .",
    "[ figmct](b ) ] : here the mct fits ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 @xcite are limited at high frequencies by the additional steeper increase , mentioned above .",
    "it was argued @xcite , that this deviation in glycerol is due to the vibrational boson peak contribution which is not taken into account by the mct interpolation formula . in pc",
    "this contribution seems to be of less importance .",
    "this is in accord with the finding of sokolov _",
    "et al_. @xcite that the amplitude ratio of boson peak and fast process is largest for strong glass formers , glycerol being much stronger than pc . however , it has to be noted , that in the present results , at least near @xmath75 this ratio is quite similar for both materials .    for @xmath33 ,",
    "idealized mct predicts the following critical temperature dependences : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . in figure [ figmopa ]    representations",
    "have been chosen that should lead to straight lines that extrapolate to @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , all three data sets can be described consistently with a @xmath79 k for pc @xcite  and @xmath80 k for glycerol @xcite as indicated by the solid lines .",
    "these values lie in the same range as the @xmath35-value obtained from other techniques @xcite . for temperatures near @xmath35",
    "the data partly deviate from the predicted behavior . within mct",
    "this can be ascribed to a smearing out of the critical behavior near @xmath35 due to hopping processes which are considered in extended versions of mct only @xcite .",
    "in addition , the above critical temperature dependences of @xmath81 , @xmath59 , and @xmath82 should be valid only for temperatures not too far above @xmath35 .",
    "therefore the proper choice of the temperature range to be used for the determination of @xmath35 is difficult which may lead to some uncertainties concerning the value of @xmath35 .    for @xmath40 , mct predicts the occurrence of a so - called  knee  at @xmath83 @xmath84  showing up as a change of power law from @xmath85 at @xmath86 @xmath84 to @xmath87 at @xmath88 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figmct](a ) the dashed lines suggest a @xmath89 behavior for frequencies just below the boson peak . for lower frequencies the experimental data exhibit a downward deviation from the @xmath90-lines",
    ". this may be indicative of the  knee  predicted by mct , but , clearly , the data are not of sufficient quality to demonstrate conclusively the existence of the  knee  .",
    "dielectric data on glass - forming pc and glycerol in an exceptionally broad frequency range have been presented and compared to each other and with the predictions of mct . concerning the @xmath34-relaxation and the excess wing , both materials behave qualitatively similar .",
    "the parameters describing the spectral form and dynamics of the @xmath34-relaxation are in rough agreement with the mct predictions but clearly , fig . [ figcdfipa ]",
    "is not very convincing in this respect .",
    "the high - frequency response of both materials provides clear evidence for the presence of fast processes in the ghz - thz region . for glycerol",
    "an additional very steep increase towards the boson peak seems to be superimposed to the shallow @xmath50-minimum . for the more fragile pc a smooth sublinear increase of @xmath5",
    "is seen up to the boson peak frequency .",
    "for both materials the frequency and temperature dependence in the minimum region can be consistently described by mct . admittedly ,",
    "also alternative explanations may be possible .",
    "but even in its idealized form , mct provides a consistent picture for a large variety of experimental facts . obviously , more sophisticated approaches within mct , e.g. including hopping processes @xcite , the boson peak @xcite , or orientational degrees of freedom @xcite are necessary to eliminate deviations still seen in the present work .",
