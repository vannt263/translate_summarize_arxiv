    "the calculation of power corrections in dis requires not only the evaluation of the matrix elements of higher - twist operators , but also the computation of the wilson coefficients beyond perturbation theory  . in  @xcite",
    "we saw already that the scale dependence of the matrix elements of the twist-2 operators matches the scale dependence of the perturbatively calculated wilson coefficients at most at large scales , so that we may expect large non - perturbative effects .",
    "a lattice calculation of the wilson coefficients would also save us to renormalize the lattice operators .",
    "we consider dis off a quark target .",
    "this is sufficient for the calculation of the ` leading ' wilson coefficients .",
    "the ope reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an off - shell quark state of momentum @xmath2 which is struck by a photon of momentum @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a scale parameter .",
    "the @xmath5 are the wilson coefficients , and @xmath6 are the forward matrix elements of the operators @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a matrix in dirac space . in the following",
    "we will distinguish between bare and renormalized quantities .",
    "in the former @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the lattice spacing . in the latter @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the renormalization scale .",
    "the wilson coefficients are independent of the target .",
    "let us denote the nucleon quantities by the superscript @xmath13 .",
    "so if we multiply the nucleon matrix elements of the operators ( [ ops ] ) by the corresponding wilson coefficients , we get the nucleon structure functions : @xmath14 the r.h.s . of ( [ nucleon ] ) , being independent of @xmath4 , can be written in different ways : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the renormalization constant of the lattice operator  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the renormalized and bare wilson coefficients are related by @xmath17 the nucleon structure functions are then most conveniently computed from the product of bare wilson coefficients and lattice nucleon matrix elements .",
    "a further advantage of this approach is that operator mixing with higher - twist operators is automatically included .",
    "sv.eepic    [ svplot ]    the plan is now to compute the tensor @xmath18 and the operator matrix elements @xmath19 for a quark in the landau gauge , and to extract the wilson coefficients from this information .",
    "we consider a system of quark momenta @xmath20 with the photon momentum being fixed .",
    "the wilson coefficients are independent of @xmath21 , so the problem is to solve the @xmath22 system of equations : @xmath23    chi.eepic    [ chi ]    where @xmath24 are the ensemble averaged ( amputated ) matrix elements of the operators ( [ ops ] ) between quark states of momentum @xmath21 , @xmath25 are the corresponding elements of the hadronic tensor , and the @xmath26 are the wilson coefficients we are looking for .",
    "the label @xmath27 runs over the various operators .",
    "note that lorentz and dirac indices have been omitted .",
    "we shall take all operators with up to three covariant derivatives into account .",
    "since we do not symmetrize over the indices @xmath28 , this includes higher - twist operators as well .",
    "we write ( [ matrix ] ) as @xmath29 to compute @xmath30 , we apply a singular value decomposition , which is the standard method of solving overdetermined equations  @xcite .",
    "we write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a column - orthonormal @xmath33 matrix , @xmath34 is a diagonal @xmath35 matrix , @xmath36 , with positive real eigenvalues @xmath37 arranged in descending order , and @xmath38 is the transpose of a column - orthonormal @xmath39 matrix . the solution @xmath30 is obtained by applying @xmath40 to @xmath41 . to find the vector @xmath30 of smallest length , we replace @xmath42 by zero if @xmath43 is dominated by noise .",
    "op_35.eepic    [ op_35 ]",
    "the calculations are done with standard wilson fermions on @xmath44 lattices at @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "so far we have looked at two configurations .",
    "we employed 71 different quark momenta . for the photon momentum we took @xmath47    in fig .  1 we show the eigenvalues @xmath43 of @xmath34 .",
    "we see a sharp decrease between @xmath48 and 50 by approximately a factor of 30 , and the @xmath43 for larger @xmath27 are probably dominated by noise . in fig .  2 we have plotted the residual error @xmath49 that results from setting @xmath50 , as a function of @xmath27",
    "the error drops sharply until @xmath27 reaches @xmath51 and then stays constant , saying that if one makes a fit with too few parameters one does not get a good fit , and if one fits with too many one ` fits to the noise ' .",
    "so we must truncate the system at @xmath52 .",
    "the commonly used wilson coefficients ( bare of all kinematical factors ) are obtained by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the tree value . in fig .",
    "3 we show the wilson coefficient @xmath55  @xcite of the operator @xmath56 with @xmath57 , again for various degrees of truncation .",
    "we find a plateau in the region where the eigenvalues @xmath43 drop to zero , so that it does not matter where exactly we truncate the system .",
    "we have chosen @xmath58 . beyond the plateau the errors on @xmath43",
    "get large .      as a first step we have verified the ope . in fig .",
    "4 we show the wilson coefficients @xmath59 of the lower dimensional operators .",
    "we compare our results with the tree - level predictions .",
    "we find that the expected structure is very well reproduced .",
    "in particular , the wilson coefficients which should be zero by symmetry or other arguments are actually found to be zero .    as a first application of our method we have determined the wilson coefficient of the operator @xmath60 already shown in fig .",
    "this operator gives the first ( non - trivial ) moment of the unpolarized structure function  @xcite , @xmath61 .",
    "we find ( at @xmath62 , cf .",
    "( [ photon ] ) ) @xmath63 .",
    "if we divide this number by the corresponding renormalization constant , @xmath64 , as given in  @xcite , we obtain @xmath65 this is to be compared with the 2-loop result of @xmath66 ."
