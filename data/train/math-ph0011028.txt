    "in non - commutative probability theory one is interested in finding generalisations of classical probabilistic concepts such as independence and processes with independent stationary increments . motivated by a central limit theorem result and by the analogy with classical brownian motion , m. boejko and r. speicher proposed in @xcite a class of operator algebras called `` generalised brownian motions '' and investigated an example of interpolation between the classical @xcite and the free motion of voiculescu @xcite .",
    "a better known interpolation is provided by the `` @xmath10-deformed commutation relations '' @xcite .",
    "such an operator algebra is obtained by performing the gns representation of the free tensor algebra @xmath11 over an arbitrary infinite dimensional real hilbert space @xmath9 , with respect to a `` gaussian state '' @xmath12 defined by the following `` pairing prescription '' : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and the sum runs over all pair partitions of the ordered set @xmath15 .",
    "the functional is uniquely determined by the complex valued function @xmath4 on pair partitions .",
    "classical brownian motion is obtained by taking @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the constant function @xmath18 on all pair partitions ; the free brownian motion @xcite requires @xmath4 to be 0 on crossing partitions and 1 on non - crossing partitions .",
    "if one considers complex hilbert spaces , the analogue of a gaussian state is called a fock state .",
    "we show that the gns representation of the free algebra @xmath19 of creation and annihilation operators with respect to a fock state @xmath20 can be described in a functorial way inspired by the notions of tensorial species of joyal @xcite : the representation space has the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 are hilbert spaces carrying unitary representations of the symmetric groups @xmath23 and @xmath24 means the subspace of the tensor product containing vectors which are invariant under the double action of @xmath23 .",
    "the creation operators have the expression : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an operator which intertwines the action of @xmath23 and @xmath27 .",
    "in section [ sec.semigroup ] we connect these fock representations with positive functionals on a certain algebraic object @xmath28 which we call the @xmath5-semigroup of `` broken pair partitions '' .",
    "the elements of this @xmath5-semigroup can be described graphically as segments located between two vertical lines which cut through the graphical representation of a pair partition . in particular , the pair partitions are elements of @xmath29 . we show that if @xmath20 is a fock state then the function @xmath4 has a natural extension to a positive functional @xmath30 on @xmath28 .",
    "the gns - like representation with respect to @xmath30 provides the combinatorial data @xmath31 associated to @xmath20 .",
    "the representation of @xmath11 with respect to a gaussian state @xmath12 is a @xmath5-algebra generated by `` fields '' @xmath32 .",
    "monomials of such fields can be seen as moments , with the corresponding cumulants being a generalisation of the wick products known from the @xmath10-deformed brownian motion @xcite . using generalised wick products we prove that any gaussian state @xmath12 extends to a fock state @xmath20 on the algebra of creation and annihilation operators @xmath33 ( see section [ gen.wick.products ] ) .",
    "second quantisation is a special type of _ functor of white noise _ , a functor from the category of real hilbert spaces with contractions to the category of ( non - commutative ) probability spaces .",
    "the underlying idea is to use the field operators @xmath34 to construct von neumann algebras @xmath35 for any real hilbert space @xmath9 and a fixed positive definite functions @xmath4 .",
    "the question is for which @xmath4 one can carry out the construction of such a functor @xmath6 . from general considerations on functors of second quantisation",
    "we obtain that the function @xmath4 must have the multiplicative property , a form of statistical independence .",
    "conversely , for multiplicative @xmath4 the field operators are essentially selfadjoint , and provide a natural definition of the von neumann algebra @xmath35 .",
    "the second step is the implemetation of the second quantisation @xmath36 of an arbitrary contraction @xmath37 between hilbert spaces .",
    "this is done separately for isometries and coisometries which are then used to define the second quatisation for arbitrary contractions .    in the last section",
    "we develop a useful criterion , in terms of the spectrum of a characteristic contraction , for factoriality of the algebras @xmath38 in the case when the vacuum state @xmath20 is tracial .",
    "we then apply it to a particular example of positive definite function @xmath39 where @xmath40 , which interpolates between the bosonic and free cases and has been introduced in @xcite ( see @xcite for another proof of the positivity ) .",
    "we conclude that @xmath38 is a type @xmath8 factor .",
    "further generalisation of this criterion to factors of type @xmath41 will be investigated in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the generalised brownian motions @xcite are representations with respect to special _ gaussian _ states on free algebras over real hilbert spaces .",

    "let @xmath4 be a multiplicative positive definite function such that @xmath20 is trace state on @xmath35 for @xmath9 infinite dimensional and such that @xmath546 is bounded .",
    "let @xmath496 be the natural isometry from @xmath9 to @xmath673 , and @xmath674 a unit vector in the orthogonal complement of its image .",
    "the function @xmath4 being multiplicative implies that the map @xmath675 defined by @xmath676 is an isometry .",
    "let @xmath677 be a disjoint partition of the ordered set + @xmath678 and @xmath679 an element of the @xmath5-semigroup of broken pair partitions with @xmath680 , @xmath681 the left legs and @xmath682 the right legs .",
    "we denote by @xmath683 the element obtained by adding to @xmath58 one pair which embraces all other pairs @xmath684    then the map @xmath685 has the following action on the generalised wick products : @xmath686 which on the level of von neumann algebras gives the completely positive contraction from @xmath35 to itself .",
    "we fix an orthonormal basis @xmath687 in @xmath9 .",
    "then by direct computation one can check that : @xmath688 let now @xmath689 be an arbitrary tracial normal state on @xmath35 . then using the fact that @xmath690 weakly as @xmath691",
    ", we get : @xmath692 suppose now that @xmath693 for all @xmath517 which by the faithfulness of the vacuum state is equivalent to @xmath694 .",
    "then by equation ( [ eq.taudephi ] ) we conclude that @xmath20 is the only trace state on @xmath35 which is thus a type @xmath8 factor .",
    "let us take a closer look at the contraction @xmath695 from equation ( [ eq.phiw ] ) the operator @xmath696 commutes with the orthogonal projectors on the spaces with definite `` occupation numbers '' @xmath697 ( see [ eq.occunumb ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath698 where @xmath699 @xmath423 and @xmath700 is the linear operator defined by @xmath701      _ proof .",
    "_ let @xmath702 be two diagrams with @xmath64 left legs and no right legs .",
    "then @xmath703 but if @xmath20 is a trace then @xmath704 which implies that @xmath705 thus @xmath706 is a selfadjoint contraction .      _ proof . _",
    "the operator @xmath706 is a selfadjoint contraction , thus @xmath708 where @xmath709 is the projection on the subspace @xmath710 .",
    "this implies [ eq.philak ] and thus @xmath35 is a @xmath8 factor .",
    "_ let @xmath702 be two diagrams with @xmath712 left legs and no right legs .",
    "then @xmath713 where we have used the selfadjointness of @xmath706 in the first step and @xmath714 in the second equality . thus the restriction of @xmath706 to @xmath715 has norm @xmath716 and we can apply theorem [ th.type2 ] .    *",
    "* the case @xmath40 is technically more difficult as the field operators are unbounded .",
    "this will be treated separately in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "+ if @xmath20 is a faithful , multiplicative , but non - tracial state for @xmath35 then the operators @xmath717 can still be defined in the same way .",
    "if moreover , @xmath707 is the only eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 of the operator @xmath706 , then by a similar argument it can be shown that the algebra @xmath35 is a factor . indeed if @xmath245 is an element in the center of @xmath35 then @xmath718 . which contradicts the assumption on @xmath706 .",
    "this factor can not be of type @xmath719 because the vacuum state is not tracial . using this observation one can construct type @xmath720 factors for certain positive definite multiplicative functions on pair partitions .",
