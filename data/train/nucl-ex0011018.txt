    "the phenomena pygmy resonance ( py ) and scissors mode ( sc ) have been discussed separately in the literature . in this work ,",
    "we investigate for the first time quantitatively , if those two experimentally observed phenomena have the same physical origin .",
    "the py was introduced as a name for non - statistical features in quasicontinuous @xmath1-ray spectra at energies below the giant dipole resonance .",
    "it is e.g.broadly discussed in a review of radiative strength functions as early as in 1973 @xcite .",
    "these non - statistical features observed in different nuclear mass regions and at different energies have different physical origins .",
    "a py in rare earth nuclei at an energy around 3.5  mev was first reported in the @xmath1-ray spectrum of @xmath2tm following a neutron capture reaction @xcite .",
    "a systematic investigation of the py parameters in deformed rare earth nuclei by radiative neutron capture has been carried out in @xcite , and very recently new investigations on the py have appeared @xcite .",
    "an important application of the py is the calculation of astrophysical ( n,@xmath1 ) reaction rates , where the existence of a soft dipole mode can greatly enhance the calculated reactions rates in e.g.  the astrophysical r - process @xcite .",
    "the sc was discovered in 1984 in inelastic electron scattering experiments on @xmath3gd @xcite .",
    "the bulk of information on the sc comes , however , from @xmath0 experiments , also called nuclear resonance fluorescence ( nrf ) .",
    "these data are compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite , which also gives systematics of average excitation energies of sc states and summed orbital m1 strengths around 3  mev .",
    "it exists no satisfactory theoretical explanation for the py , and it is an interesting thought that the py and the sc might emerge due to the same physical origin , i.e.  if the py can be described in terms of the observed orbital m1 strength from nrf experiments . in order to investigate this idea , we will compare the energy , the spreading width , and the resonance strength of the two phenomena .",
    "in nrf experiments , the energy - integrated cross - section @xmath4 of resonant scattered @xmath1-rays on the ground state , populating a state at excitation energy @xmath5 and then decaying down to a low - lying final state @xmath6 , is given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the partial radiative decay widths for transitions from the excited state to the ground state and the final state , respectively , @xmath10 is the total radiative width of the excited state and @xmath11 is a spin - factor . in nrf experiments on even - even nuclei , the excited states are usually observed to decay into two states , the ground state and the first excited state , denoted by 1 ( in deformed nuclei the first rotational @xmath12 state ) . the experimental information from nrf experiments on even - even nuclei consists therefore generally of the energy and the values @xmath13 and @xmath14 for every observed state .",
    "often , instead of listing @xmath14 values , the branching ratio @xmath15 with @xmath16 is given @xcite , where @xmath17 is the energy of the @xmath1-ray transition , populating the first excited state .",
    "summing over all final states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : if ] ) , the total energy - integrated photon - absorption cross - section @xmath18 is obtained .",
    "experimentally , one observes the partial energy - integrated photon - absorption cross - sections of excited states @xmath19 where the word partial refers to the fact , that only the two decay branches to the ground state and to the first excited state are taken into account in the sum . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : if ] ) , @xmath20    the decay pattern in odd - nuclei is much more complex , since one can populate by dipole radiation excited levels with , in general , three different spins . in nrf experiments on odd gadolinium and dysprosium isotopes @xcite , branching ratios",
    "have been reported to several different low - lying states . however ,",
    "very few individual excited states show @xmath1 decay to more than one of these states at the same time .",
    "in addition , the observed branching ratios scatter strongly . for many excited states , only the ground state transition has been detected .",
    "a probable explanation for this observation is that the dipole strength in odd nuclei is highly fragmented , thus ground state transitions in odd nuclei are in general much weaker than in even nuclei .",
    "the even weaker branches to low - lying states might therefore easily fall below the experimental detection limit . on the other hand , due to the high fragmentation , the chances will increase that accidentally two excited states are separated in energy by the excitation energy of some low - lying state , and that the two respective peaks in the @xmath1-ray spectrum are therefore interpreted as two branches from one excited state .",
    "this problem has e.g.  already been observed in the even nucleus @xmath21yb @xcite .    in general , data on odd nuclei are very scarce ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , and the results are not conclusive .",
    "the summed observed m1 strength in odd nuclei is by far weaker than in even - even nuclei .",
    "this has been explained in terms of unresolved strength hiding in the experimental background .",
    "a fluctuation analysis on the background has been performed @xcite , and indeed the resulting summed m1 strength in @xmath22gd has been found to be approximately the same value as in the neighboring even nuclei .",
    "however , it has not yet been shown that similar results can be achieved for the much less fragmented m1 strength in @xmath23dy , which has been investigated with a quite similar detection threshold as @xmath22gd @xcite , still , a new analysis is in progress and might prove the opposite @xcite .",
    "in addition , the observed irregular branching properties of excited states in odd nuclei show that the nrf technique is taken to its very limit in the investigation of odd nuclei , and that global sc observables , like summed m1 strengths and average excitation energies of sc states from such experiments , have to be taken with great care . as a last and very important point",
    "one should mention that the m1 character of the observed radiation in nrf experiments on odd nuclei has never been measured experimentally .",
    "in fact , e1 and even e2 radiation can not be excluded @xcite . in the further discussion",
    ", we will therefore mainly concentrate on even nuclei , where the deduced data are based on a more transparent experimental situation .",
    "the py photon - absorption cross - section is usually parameterized by a lorentzian function @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the strength , centroid and width of the py , respectively .",
    "these parameters have been obtained by fits to experimental data @xcite , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] .",
    "previously investigated m1 strength arises due to the tail of the spin - flip resonance ( gmdr ) @xcite .",
    "this resonance can be described by a lorentzian function @xmath29 as well @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the strength , centroid and width of the gmdr , respectively .",
    "assuming that the py is due to magnetic dipole strength , one can add the two cross - sections incoherently and obtain the total m1 photon - absorption cross - section @xmath34 @xmath35 one can , at this point , discuss if deviations from the lorentzian description of the py and interference between the py ( presumably orbital m1 strength ) and the spin - flip resonance might occur .",
    "neither of the two effects is , however , manifested in the experimental data in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see e.g.  fig .  [",
    "fig : data ] ) , and therefore they must be very limited in size and are neglected in the further calculation . in the upper panels of fig.[fig : branch ] ,",
    "the two contributions to the total m1 photon - absorption cross - section and their sums for the nuclei @xmath36dy and @xmath21yb are shown .",
    "when comparing to the results of the nrf experiments , one should , however , in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq : branch ] ) define the partial m1 photon - absorption cross - section @xmath37 , where branching only to the ground state and the first excited state is taken into account , i.e.@xmath38 here , the index qc refers to the fact that the semi - experimental quantity @xmath37 is calculated by means of strength functions obtained in the quasicontinuum .",

    "( [ eq : partial ] ) , ( [ eq : gt ] ) and ( [ eq : g01 ] ) , the level density and the radiative strength functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 have to be known .",
    "recently , these data have been obtained experimentally @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : data ] ) for the four nuclei @xmath51dy and @xmath52yb from the ( @xmath53he,@xmath54 ) reaction by using an iteration technique .",
    "the parameters of the py have also been extracted from these experiments .",
    "the quality of the data allows us to calculate the partial photon - absorption cross - section and make comparison to nrf data .",
    "a problem encountered here is that radiative strength functions , obtained for @xmath1 transitions in the quasicontinuum , have to be used at low excitation energies where nuclear structure effects can be predominant .",
    "for instance , the observed branching ratios in nrf experiments @xcite for even nuclei with @xmath55 and 2 for @xmath56 and 0 states , respectively , can not be reproduced accurately within this approach , where one obtains branching ratios of approximately 1 for both cases .",
    "the branching ratios are , on the other hand , well estimated by the alaga rules , describing the nucleus in the rotational limit and thereby assuming a good @xmath57 quantum number .",
    "unfortunately , a nuclear structure effect represented by e.g.  a good @xmath57-quantum number can not be easily incorporated in the common definition of the radiative strength function .",
    "therefore , we use here the statistical approach of eq .",
    "( [ eq : g01 ] ) . since the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g01 ] ) is over two low - lying states only , we can not expect that all possible nuclear structure effects are averaged out by our treatment .    in fig .",

    "can now be calculated by @xmath60 where the integral covers the appropriate energy interval of interest .",
    "in the following , experimental data of the py will be compared to the global observables of sc data .",
    "first , a comparison of the centroids and widths is performed . for the sc ,",
    "one obtains an average excitation energy of 2.87  mev for @xmath36dy @xcite .",
    "this value changes by less than 10  kev when taking into account possible additional strength where no parity assignment was possible .",
    "the nrf experiment on @xmath21yb was performed without polarimeter , thus , no model - independent parity assignment could be performed .",
    "if one , however , assumes that all states with @xmath56 are populated by m1 radiation - ray spectrum .",
    "it seems that also the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite are tending to this hypothesis ( see e.g.  their fig .  5 ) .",
    "using hypothesis one would not change the conclusion drawn in this article . ]",
    "the average excitation energy of the sc states is 3.09  mev @xcite . including states with uncertain @xmath57 assignment yields a higher value of 3.26  mev , mainly due to the strong transition at 3.863  mev .",
    "these values compare well with the centroids of the py being 2.73(5 )  mev and 3.48(7 )  mev for @xmath36dy and @xmath21yb , respectively @xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed spreading of sc states in @xmath36dy and @xmath21yb , which is estimated by the energy difference between the highest and the lowest observed sc state in the nrf experiment , are 0.67  mev and 1.0  mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the latter value increases to 1.3  mev when taking the transition at 3.863  mev into account .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the widths of the py , which were determined to be 1.35  mev and 1.30  mev for @xmath36dy and @xmath21yb , respectively @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dist ] shows the distribution of sc states for both nuclei . in the same figure , also @xmath37 is displayed .",
    "the distribution of observed sc states coincides very well with the maximum and the width of the @xmath37 curves .    in the second step ,",
    "the strength of the py is compared to the summed cross - section of sc states . for @xmath36dy ,",
    "one obtains @xmath61 for all transitions with m1 assignment and @xmath62 , when also taking into account transitions to states with undetermined parity . for @xmath21yb",
    ", these quantities read @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the difference of some @xmath65 between the latter values is mostly due to the state at 3.863  mev with uncertain @xmath57 assignment and hence uncertain parity .",
    "here , one should recall once more that the m1 character of transitions in @xmath21yb is not determined model independently by a polarimeter . for the py",
    ", one has to integrate @xmath37 over an appropriate energy interval .",
    "we choose , for both nuclei , a 2  mev wide energy region between 2  mev and 4  mev .",
    "the integration intervals are marked by vertical lines in fig.[fig : dist ] .",
    "the choice of the intervals is motivated by the fact that in nrf experiments the experimental conditions allow to observe possible sc states only in this energy region .",
    "the chosen integration region coincides also quite well with @xmath66 , and is therefore covering most of the area of the py .",
    "we obtain for @xmath36dy and @xmath21yb values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . for convenience ,",
    "all data are also collected in table [ tab : result ] .",
    "it is now difficult to judge the errors of these values .",
    "certainly , the lorentzian shapes of the py and the gmdr are somehow idealized with respect to nature .",
    "in addition , the strength functions used for evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq : partial ] ) are all obtained experimentally in the quasicontinuum , but they have to be applied to transitions to low - lying states in e.g.  eq .",
    "( [ eq : g01 ] ) .",
    "some shortcomings of the statistical approach to the region of discrete levels have already been discussed in sect.[sec : pygmy ] .",
    "probably , a considerable systematical error is therefore introduced in @xmath58 .",
    "nevertheless , the difference of 2040% between the calculated and the experimental values for the @xmath21yb nucleus and the agreement within 10% for the @xmath36dy nucleus allow to hope that the systematic error of the calculation is not too high and within an approximate error of 30% , we find good agreement with the sc data .",
    "other reasons for discrepancy between estimated and experimental sc strength may exist .",
    "firstly , some strength of the py could in fact be e1 radiation .",
    "such a resonance has been suggested by p. van isacker et al .",
    "@xcite in a schematic calculation . within their model ,",
    "the valence neutrons oscillate with respect to the core of neutrons and protons .",
    "however , this excitation mode has not yet been observed in nrf experiments .",
    "another possibility is that in nrf experiments sc states are populated from the ground state where pairing correlations are important .",
    "the py strength functions are , on the other hand , obtained in the quasicontinuum , where depairing @xcite has been observed .",
    "it has been shown , that depairing yields in general a higher summed m1 strength and also higher excitation energies of the sc @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the m1 character of the py in rare earth nuclei could not yet be determined experimentally .",
    "in fact , the py in iron and lead nuclei have recently been measured to be of e1 character @xcite . since the py in these nuclei , which have other mass numbers and deformations than rare earth nuclei , occur at higher excitation energies and consequently may have different physical origins , no strong conclusions to rare earth nuclei should be drawn from these results .",
    "an indirect proof for the m1 character of the py in rare earth nuclei comes from ( n,2@xmath1 ) experiments on @xmath36dy with thermal neutrons , using the sum - coincidence method . here ,",
    "f. bev et al .",
    "@xcite have found good agreement with experiment when including a resonant component around 3  mev in their m1 strength - function model .",
    "since they only use schematic level density functions in their analysis , this result can , however , only serve as a strong hint of the m1 character of the py in rare earth nuclei . still , one can conclude that different experimental observations commonly labeled as pygmy resonances might have different physical origins .",
    "in nrf experiments , often ground - state decay widths @xmath8 or reduced transition probabilities @xmath70 are given as results .",
    "these quantities can be calculated from the total energy - integrated photon - absorption cross - section @xmath71 by @xmath72 and @xmath73 where the latter equation is only valid for m1 transitions .",
    "however , only the partial energy - integrated photon - absorption cross - section @xmath74 is measured in nrf experiments , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : scissors ] .",
    "usually , one therefore assumes that @xmath75 @xcite , i.e.@xmath76 over the whole energy region where excited states are observed .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig : branch ] shows that this assumption may become incorrect for energies above @xmath773  mev . of course , the estimates in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : branch ] are quite rough , since experimental radiative strength functions obtained in the quasicontinuum are applied to the energy region of discrete levels . still , the large deviation from the common assumption ( [ eq : g0g1 g ] ) can not be neglected because we have obtained good agreement between estimated and experimental partial energy - integrated photon - absorption cross - sections , see table [ tab : result ] . as a consequence , too low @xmath69 values",
    "may have been reported in nrf works . we will therefore in the following estimate the summed @xmath69 value of the sc , based on the assumption that the py is entirely due to orbital m1 strength .",
    "combining eqs .",

    "@xcite , summed @xmath69 strengths of @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath36dy and @xmath21yb , respectively , are found . here",
    ", one should stress that these values follow rather directly from experiment , since the py parameters are obtained by a fit to normalized , purely experimental strength function data . neither branching ratios are needed , nor the assumption of a lorentzian shape of the py does influence this result much .",
    "although these data are rather high compared to recent estimates @xcite using effective relative @xmath11-factors of @xmath85 , theoretical values around e.g.  67@xmath86 have indeed been discussed in the literature for dysprosium and ytterbium nuclei in a sum - rule approach @xcite , assuming free values of the @xmath11-factors .",
    "if our assumption for calculating the summed sc strength holds , the reason for observing summed strengths around @xmath87 in nrf experiments would not be the manifestation of effective @xmath11 factors , but rather partly the lack of detected branching from sc states to higher lying states than the first excited state and partly the fact that some strength lies outside the investigated energy region of 2 - 4  mev .",
    "the assumption of a dominant m1 character of the py can also be confirmed by a reproduction of the observed e1 strength in nrf experiments using the strength functions from the quasicontinuum .",

    "also the missing strength in nrf experiments on odd nuclei compared to even nuclei has been interpreted in terms of additional branching to higher lying states than the first excited states . since branching",
    "might play a crucial role in the interpretation of nrf data , we would like to confront our branching estimates to experimental measurements of branching ratios from the sum - coincidence method .",
    "here , one should especially keep in mind that the radiative strength functions used for estimating branching ratios in this work are only based on experimental data down to energies of @xmath112  mev , whereas below , extrapolations of the experimental data by theoretical models have to be used .    the investigation of the sc in the quasicontinuum is complementary to the conventional nrf method .",
    "it might yield valuable data on branching ratios , summed m1 strengths and possible odd - even effects , as well as the influence of depairing on the summed m1 strength .",
