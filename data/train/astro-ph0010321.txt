    "in the recent past , maser studies of late - type stars have undergone a resurgence in popularity .",
    "u orionis experienced an unusual outburst in 1972 , and several papers about this source were published beginning in the late 1970 s ( reid et al .",
    "1979 , cimerman 1979 , fix 1979 , fix et al .",
    "1980 , jewell , webber and snyder 1981 , chapman and cohen 1985 ) .",
    "since then , many authors have used vlbi techniques to determine the distribution , strength , and polarization of oh maser components in various stars ( e.g. chapman , et al .",
    "1994 , szymczak , cohen and richards 1998 , sahai , et al . 1999 ,",
    "szymczak and lesqueren 1999 , palen and fix 1999 ) .",
    "these observations have been extremely useful in investigations of envelope dynamics and stellar mass loss .    in the early 1970 s",
    ", fix began a monitoring program of oh / ir stars at arecibo observatory . in the course of this program , it became apparent that the oh maser emission was undergoing significant variations in amplitude ( as much as 2 - 3 jy at the peak ) and velocity ( of order a few km / s ) of spectral features over time scales as short as two years .",
    "in 2000 , palen and fix presented a model which uses a turbulent plasma to vary the coherence of the maser components in order to explain the temporal variation of these masers .",
    "this work was based primarily on observations of one of the most well - studied oh / ir stars , u herculis .",
    "fortunately , this model makes testable predictions .",
    "the first is that objects with a higher degree of polarization ( here and throughout , polarization is substituted for circular polarization ) will be more variable .",
    "this prediction was tested using two decades of arecibo data by fix ( 2000 ) , and he finds a strong correlation between variability and polarization .",
    "second , this model predicts that in the absence of a magnetic field , masers will be constrained to appear in a region near the central star . in a smooth non - magnetized radial outflow ,",
    "the masers are confined to the region of the shell near the line of sight to the central star ( figure 1 ) , because that is the only region where the emitting molecules are strongly velocity coherent along the line of sight . if , however , the outflow carries a magnetic field , in particular a turbulent magnetic field , then the cook mechanism ( cook 1975 ) simulates the required velocity coherence by zeeman splitting the lines .",
    "this mechanism produces 100% polarized emission in each component .",
    "therefore , we can predict that sources with highly polarized spectra will be composed of maser emission which may arise in regions far from the central star .",
    "masers in sources with less polarized spectra will be confined to a location near the central star .",
    "if the medium is turbulent in both velocity and magnetic field , then the maser emission will be produced by many regions of small angular extent , and nearly 100% polarized emission .",
    "in most recent vlbi observations of late - type stars , the masers are partially resolved , and the emission is seen to come from many small , highly polarized components ( see , for example , palen and fix 2000 , chapman et al .",
    "1994 , and szymczak , cohen and richards 1999 ) . here",
    "we show that in more highly polarized sources these maser regions are found farther from the central star .    in section [ observations ]",
    ", we describe the observations taken from the literature , and give some background information about these objects . in section [ comppol ] , we determine the degree of polarization in the spectra of four late - type stars , and in the individual maser components . in section [ compext ] , we find the extent of the maser emission in these stars , and show that this is correlated with the degree of polarization . in section [ discussion ] , we discuss these results , and make recommendations for future investigation of the problem .",
    "to investigate the relationship between polarization and the extent of the maser emission , we require observations in two lines pumped by the same mechanism , so that we probe the same region of the circumstellar environment .",
    "the oh maser lines are ideal .",
    "each object must be observed in two bands , so that we can control for intrinsic variations of envelope size or morphology due to evolutionary state or environment .",
    "in addition to our own observations of u her , we found four other suitable sets of observations reported in the literature , see table 1 .",
    "the two epochs of u her data have proven particularly interesting , as described in section 3 .",
    "the degree of polarization in a spectrum is given by    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the right and left circularly polarized flux density at a given velocity , respectively .",
    "the degree of polarization was calculated for each star at 1665 mhz and at 1667 mhz ( table 2 ) .",
    "plots of spectra in the literature were used to determine the flux densities for r cas ( chapman , et al .",
    "1994 , single dish data presented in figures 7 and 8) , r crt ( szymczak , cohen and richards 1999 , figure 1 ) , and w hya ( chapman , et al .",
    "1994 , figure 12 ) .",
    "we estimate the error in the degree of polarization as measured in this way to be approximately 0.1 .    using a very simple , straightforward test",
    ", we checked to be certain that individual components were indeed highly polarized . for two of the objects ( u her and r cas ) , we could simply look at the composite diagrams presented in chapman et al .",
    "( 1994 , figures 5 and 10 ) , and estimate the percentage of components which overlapped . for the other two objects , w hya and r crt",
    ", we cut out the plots and overlayed them , to see if spots in right circularly polarized emission were coincident with those in left circularly polarized emission .",
    "this simple device allows us to check the registration of the two images , by sliding the images relative to one another . for these objects",
    ", the registration appeared to be accurate , as translating one image relative to another did not increase the number of overlapping spots .",
    "no more than 10% of the spots outside of the main core overlapped .",
    "while this simple cut and compare mechanism may be corrupted by photocopying errors , etc . , these errors are likely to be small , and would not change the overall conclusion , that the majority of spots outside the main core are small and highly polarized .",
    "in addition , we considered that there should be a chance coincidence of spot location .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by overlaying 1667 and 1665 mhz emission maps in rcp and lcp respectively . in theory",
    ", these maps should have nothing to do with one another .",
    "in many pairings , a few spots overlapped , comparable to the 10% overlap between different polarizations in the same line . this supports the conclusion that the majority of the spots outside of the core , perhaps all of them , are highly polarized .",
    "the extent of the maser emission was determined directly from the vlbi maps ( figures 4 , 9 and 12 from chapman et al . , and figure 2 from szymczak , cohen and richards ) .",
    "the diameter of the maser emitting region was found by fitting the smallest circle which encompasses all of the observed maser emission .",
    "we estimate that the uncertainty in the diameter is approximately 70 mas .",
    "table 2 shows the results for all four stars .",
    "linear sizes were calculated using the distances given in table 1 .    in order to compare different stars to each other",
    ", we took the difference in polarization and compared it to the difference in linear extent of the maser emission ( figure [ plot ] ) .",
    "errors caused by errors in the distance ( assumed to be 20% ) , propagate to be of order @xmath3 pc , insignificant when compared to other sources of error .",
    "the correlation between these parameters is clear . when the difference between polarizations increases , so does the difference in extent .    in the case of right",
    "circularly polarized emission from u herculis , chapman s 1994 observations do not appear to fit this pattern .",
    "its size of 970 mas at 1667 mhz ( p=0.1 ) and 600 mas at 1665 mhz ( p=0.2 ) ran counter to the prediction .",
    "however , chapman et al . ( 1994 ) found that some of the maser spots in u her appeared to be related to one another because they possessed similar velocities and are part of a filamentary structure emanating from a  hole  in the maser emission .",
    "this filament is weak , producing less than 1% of the flux in the shell , and appears to be physically distinct from the general outflow . by the time of our vlba observations in 1996",
    ", it had disappeared entirely .",
    "we feel justified in excluding the filament from the overall size of the emission region , as a physically distinct outflow structure , whose velocity coherence was transient and anomalous . the bulk of the maser emission from u her in 1985 is smaller at 1667 mhz than at 1665 mhz , consistent with the prediction of the turbulence model . in 1995",
    ", the maser emission fits the prediction with no special justification . within the error bars ,",
    "the difference in polarization and extent are identical at both epochs ( whether or not the filament is excluded ) .",
    "the plasma turbulence model predicts that the extent of maser emission should correlate with the degree of polarization .",
    "we have found this to be true for four late - type stars .",
    "the result suggests that the plasma turbulence model of maser emission may be generally applicable .",
    "correlation does not imply cause and effect , and alternate explanations for this correlation need to be investigated .",
    "a few possible causes can be immediately investigated and ruled out . in this group of four stars ,",
    "two show 1665 mhz emission as most polarized and most extended , and two show 1667 mhz emission as most polarized and most extended .",
    "there is no preference for one main line to be produced farther from the central star .",
    "there is also no correlation in the data between the flux in the line and polarization , or between flux and extent of the emission .",
    "this implies that sensitivity of the instruments in the main lines is not complicating the issue .",
    "finding suitable objects for a more extensive study of this type is difficult . they must be bright in two lines which are close together in frequency .",
    "the stars must be near enough that the maser components are resolved by vlbi , and they must be observed simultaneously in both polarizations and both main lines .",
    "thus far there are few suitable candidates in the literature .",
    "this verification of the presence of magnetic fields in these late - type stars lends credibility to the argument that complex , symmetric shapes observed in planetary nebulae may be caused by magnetic shaping .",
    "if we can begin to establish a connection between varieties of late - type stars , and the various morphologies of planetary nebulae , we will have come a long way towards an understanding both types of objects .",
