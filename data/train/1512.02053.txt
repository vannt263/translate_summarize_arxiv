    "@xcite have established strain gradient theories to evaluate size effects by allowing the total stress tensor to become asymmetric .",
    "additionally , the work conjugated quantity to the strain gradient , namely the couple stress tensor , was also accepted to be asymmetric .",
    "such models usually reproduce the size effect in the sense that  smaller is stronger \" , which is a central point of strain gradient modeling @xcite .    the special strain gradient theory in the work of yang et al .",
    "@xcite is a subclass of the former and uses a symmetric second order couple stress tensor @xmath0 for the so called modified couple stress model , whose decisive advantage is to reduce the number of additional constitutive coefficients to just one characteristic length scale . in effect",
    ", they try to motivate that the couple stress tensor itself should be symmetric .",
    "many subsequent papers have used this approach . from our point of view",
    ", an artificial equilibrium condition is used to imply the symmetry of the couple stress tensor .",
    "therefore , their argument is not consistent , as has also been previously noted by lazopoulos  @xcite and hadjesfandiari and dargush  @xcite .",
    "however , this does not mean that symmetry of the couple stress tensor in itself violates any physical law , as repeatedly claimed by hadjesfandiari and dargush  @xcite .",
    "indeed , several different motivations for a symmetric couple stress tensor have already been given .",
    "for example , a sequence of smaller and smaller samples should have bounded stiffness in bending and torsion since the physics dictates bounded energy . however , in the framework of the isotropic , linear cosserat model ( and the indeterminate couple stress model is a limit of that model ) such boundedness necessitates to take a symmetric moment stress tensor @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we will therefore review the indeterminate couple stress model in order to appreciate some of the modeling issues which are involved in the discussion above .",
    "first , we are presenting the couple stress framework based on a variational derivation .",
    "this derivation starts from assuming a certain energy involving second ( rotational ) gradients and immediately uses the small strain kinematics and the isotropy assumption . in this way",
    ", a format of the balance equations is derived as euler - lagrange equations , together with the assumed constitutive relations and various boundary conditions . here",
    ", the couple stress tensor is already seen to be trace - free : @xmath1 .",
    "in addition we touch further upon conformal invariance requirements which are naturally connected with symmetric couple stresses .",
    "+ this variational development will be compared with another derivation of the couple stress model , which does not make use of any constitutive assumptions like small strains , linearity or isotropy .",
    "we will only invoke balance principles applied to infinitesimal cubes and the existence of a total ( in general non - symmetric ) stress field @xmath2 .",
    "the couple stress tensor @xmath0 will be identified with its assignment to be an exclusive stress resultant for the balance of angular momentum . on the other hand",
    ", the couple stress tensor will not appear in the balance of linear momentum .",
    "however , contrarily to what is classically done , we allow higher order variations of the total stress field over the cube with the result of being able to clearly identify the couple stress tensor @xmath3 .",
    "the final outcome is a set of two coupled balance equations having exactly the same format as the indeterminate couple stress model derived with the variational approach .",
    "since no constitutive assumptions are yet involved , no condition for the trace of the couple stress tensor is included .",
    "interestingly , if we assume from the outset the symmetry of the total stress tensor @xmath2 we arrive consistently at @xmath1 in this framework",
    ". however , the total stress tensor in the indeterminate couple stress model is not symmetric in the standard approach .",
    "this can be modified by adding a self - equilibrated stress - field ( thus , the balance equations are the same , but different boundary conditions are implied ) and the full correspondence can be established to the model , see our paper @xcite . additionally ,",
    "relating couple stress effects to isochoric deformation modes only , we find again an argument for the symmetry of the couple stress tensor @xmath3 .",
    "both results can also be found in continuum theories with conformally invariant curvature measure , which reduces the number of constitutive parameters to a minimum @xcite .",
    "thus , our procedure provides constitutive statements from an equilibrium method and reasonable assumptions of the classical continuum theory , recovering previous results obtained via variational procedures now using a suitable balance approach .",
    "+ finally , we critically discuss in detail the underlying reasoning of the motivation of a symmetric couple stress tensor in yang et al .",
    "@xcite and come to the conclusion that it is not tenable : the authors do not present a convincing argument for symmetric couple stress tensors .",
    "this , however , does not imply that assuming symmetry of the couple stress tensor violates any fundamental physical law , as erroneously claimed in hadjesfandiari and dargush @xcite .",
    "we show this by some simple examples .",
    "+ the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the classical indeterminate couples stress model including some of its variants in the isotropic and hyperelastic setting and some remarks on conformal invariance of the curvature energy are recalled .",
    "then , the balance equations for couple stress models are treated in general .",
    "next , the origin and properties of couple stress are systematically investigated on the basis of the total stress function , the balance of linear momentum , and the balance of angular momentum",
    ". then we try to explain the approach of yang et al .",
