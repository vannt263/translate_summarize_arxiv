    ", we make some further remarks .",
    "first , in the present note we fix a very specific system in the wider class considered in  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this choice is twofold : i ) it simplifies the notation and ii ) the analysis in the present note is sufficient for the applications in  @xcite .",
    "note , moreover , that in the proof of lemma  [ l:22:heuristic ] we use ( although not in an essential way ) the exact expression of the function @xmath14 evaluated at @xmath15 . however , we are confident that our results can be extended to wider classes of systems of the type considered in  @xcite .",
    "second , in this note the only occurrences where we explicitly use the precise expression of the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 is in the results discussed in    [ ss : baj ] .",
    "more precisely , the proofs of lemmas  [ l:22:heuristic ] and  [ l:12:heuristic ] both rely on a perturbation argument : we first show that our system verifies the statement of the lemmas in the case @xmath15 and then we show that the same holds provided @xmath6 is sufficiently small .",
    "the proof of lemma  [ l:12:heuristic ] is completely independent of the specific expression of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the perturbation argument in the proof of lemma  [ l:22:heuristic ]",
    "we use some results from    [ ss : baj ] , but we never directly use the specific expression of @xmath8 and @xmath16 .",
    "third , the baiti - jenssen   system in not physical , in the sense that it does not admit strictly convex entropies , see  @xcite for a proof .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether or not the results established in the present note can be extended to physical systems . very loosely speaking , by combining lemmas  [ l:12:heuristic ] and  [ l:22:heuristic ] below with the analysis in  @xcite we get the following statement . under suitable conditions ,",
    "the only waves generated at the interactions between two shocks are shock waves , or , more precisely , no rarefaction waves are generated at the interaction between two shocks .",
    "there are actually several physical systems that share this property : for instance , one can consider the @xmath17 example discussed by diperna in  @xcite and assume that the data have sufficiently small total variation .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for the analysis of shock interactions for this system . on the other hand ,",
    "a much more challenging question is whether or not there is any physical system that exhibit the same behaviors as those discussed in  @xcite . in other words",
    ", one can wonder whether or not a physical system can i ) exhibit finite time blow up or ii ) violate the regularity prescribed , for scalar conservation laws , by schaeffer s theorem . to the best of the authors knowledge , the answers to the above questions",
    "is presently open .",
    "we now give some technical details about the estimates we establish .",
    "first , we point out that the baiti - jenssen system   is strictly hyperbolic in the unit ball , which amounts to say that the jacobian matrix @xmath18 admits three real and distinct eigenvalues @xmath19 for every @xmath20 such that @xmath21 . also , if @xmath22 every characteristic field is genuinely nonlinear .",
    "in other words , let @xmath23 denote the right smooth eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalues @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath25 for some suitable constant @xmath26 and for every @xmath27 and @xmath21 . in the following , we distinguish three families of shocks : we term a given shock 1- , 2- or 3-shock depending on whether the speed of the shock is close to @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "we also point out that establishing interaction estimates for system   boils down to the following .",
    "consider the so - called riemann problem , namely the cauchy problem obtained by coupling   with an initial datum in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 are constant states .",
    "the above problem admits , in general , infinitely many distributional solutions : we term  _ admissible _ the solution constructed by lax in the pioneering work  @xcite , see ",
    "[ ss : lax ] for a brief overview . establishing interaction estimates for   amounts to establish estimates on the admissible solution of the riemann problem  - in the case when @xmath32 and @xmath34 satisfy suitable structural assumptions .",
    "the first case we consider is the case of the interaction of two @xmath35-shocks , see figure  [ f:2interazione ] , left part . in other words , we assume that there is a state @xmath36 such that    * @xmath32 and @xmath37 are the left and the right states of a lax admissible 2-shock , * @xmath37 and @xmath34 are the left and the right states of a lax admissible 2-shock and * the shock between @xmath32 and @xmath37 has higher speed than the shock between @xmath37 and @xmath34 .",
    "we now give an heuristic formulation of our interaction estimate and we refer to    [ s:22 ] for the rigorous statement , which requires some technical notation . here",
    "we only point out that the _ strength _ of a shock is a quantity defined in   [ ss : lax ] which is proportional to the modulus of the difference between the left and the right state of the shock .",

    "consider the interaction between two 2-shocks and assume that the states @xmath32 and @xmath34 are sufficiently close to @xmath41 .",
    "if the strengths of the interacting 2-shocks are sufficiently small , then the admissible solution of the riemann problem  - is obtained by patching together a 1-shock , a 2-shock and a 3-shock .",
    "we remark that the relevant point in the above result is that the solution of the riemann problem that we consider in the statement contains no rarefaction wave .",
    "the second case we consider is the case of the interaction between a @xmath42-shock and a @xmath35-shock , see figure  [ f:2interazione ] , right part .",
    "in other words , we assume that there is a state @xmath36 such that    * @xmath32 and @xmath37 are the left and the right states of a lax admissible 2-shock , * @xmath37 and @xmath34 are the left and the right states of a lax admissible 1-shock .",
    "the case of the interaction of a @xmath43-shock with a @xmath35-shock is analogous .",
    "we now give an heuristic formulation of our result and we refer to    [ s:12 ] for the rigorous statement .",
    "[ l:12:heuristic ] consider the interaction between a @xmath42-shock and a @xmath35-shock and assume both shocks have sufficiently small strength .",
    "then the admissible solution of the riemann problem  - is obtained by patching together a 1-shock , a 2-shock and a 3-shock .",
    "also , we establish quantitative bounds from above and from below on the strength of the outgoing shocks , see formulas  .    note",
    "that the fact that the three outgoing waves are shocks follows from the analysis in  @xcite .",
    "also , the bound from above on the strength of the outgoing @xmath43-shocks follows from by now classical interaction estimates , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page  133 , ( 7.31 ) ) : the main novelty in lemma  [ l:12:heuristic ] is that we have a new bound from below on the strength of the outgoing @xmath43-shock , see the left hand side of formula  .",
    "this estimate is important for the analysis in  @xcite .",

    "this is a remarkable property because loosely speaking systems where all the characteristic field are genuinely nonlinear are usually better behaved than general systems .",
    "for instance , the celebrated decay estimate by olenik  @xcite , which applies to scalar conservation laws with convex fluxes , has been extended to systems of conservation laws where all the characteristic field are genuinely nonlinear , see for instance the works by glimm and lax  @xcite , by liu  @xcite and , more recently , by bressan and colombo  @xcite , bressan and goatin  @xcite and bressan and yang  @xcite , while for balance laws we refer to christoforou and trivisa  @xcite .",

    "consider furthermore the cauchy problem obtained by coupling   with the initial condition @xmath49 under some further technical assumption on the structure of the flux , glimm  @xcite established existence of a global in time solution of the cauchy problem provided that @xmath50 , the total variation of the initial datum , is sufficiently small . under the same assumptions , bressan and several collaborators established uniqueness results ,",
    "see  @xcite for a detailed exposition .",
    "the requirement that the total variation @xmath50 is small is highly restrictive , but necessary to obtain well - posedness results unless additional assumptions are imposed on the flux function @xmath51 .",

    "the solution is admissible in the sense that it is piecewise constant and every shock is lax admissible . for further examples of finite time blow up ,",

    "consider a scalar conservation law with strictly convex flux , namely equation   in the case when @xmath45 attains real values and @xmath52 is uniformly convex , i.e. @xmath53 for some constant @xmath26 .",

    "it is known that , even if @xmath13 is smooth , the entropy admissible solution can develop shocks , namely discontinuities that propagate in the @xmath54-plane .",
    "schaeffer s theorem states that , for a generic smooth initial datum , the number of shocks of the entropy admissible solution is locally finite .",

    "we discuss whether or not schaeffer s theorem extends to systems of conservation laws where every characteristic field is genuinely nonlinear , namely   holds .",
    "note that the assumption that every characteristic field is genuinely nonlinear can be loosely speaking regarded as the analogous for systems of the condition ( which applies to scalar equations ) that the flux is strictly convex .",
    "indeed , regularity results for scalar equations with strictly convex fluxes have been extended to systems where every characteristic field is genuinely nonlinear : as we mentioned before , this is the case of olenik s  @xcite decay estimate , see for instance  @xcite for possible extensions to systems .",
