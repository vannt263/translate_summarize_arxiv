    "mathematical models have come to play an important role in pricing and hedging derivative instruments since black and scholes seminal work ( ) . the black - scholes option pricing formula has been used extensively , even to evaluate options whose underlying asset ( e.g. the stock ) is known to not satisfy the black - scholes hypothesis of a constant volatility .",
    "we go about our work as if we are correct , we often treat parameters as if we think they are .",
    "and yet in the strict sense of word we do not know how much we do not know .",
    "unknown parameters , typically , mean and volatility uncertainty lead to model risk or model uncertainty .",
    "model risk is an inescapable consequence of model use .",
    "it is often hidden or glossed over and is often overlooked . a failure to consider model risk",
    "can lead a firm to disaster , and sometimes has , as pointed in .",
    "a typical case of model risk is the choice of probabilistic models .",
    "often a decision maker or a risk manager is not able to attribute a precise probability to future outcomes .",
    "this situation has been called uncertainty by .",
    "knight uncertainty sometimes is used to designate the situation where probabilities are unknown .",
    "alternatively , we speak of _ ambiguity _ when we are facing several possible specifications @xmath3 for probabilities on future outcomes ( ) .",
    "ambiguity aversion has shown to have important consequences in macroeconomics ( ) and for price behavior in capital markets ( ) . in this circumstance , fair option values and perfectly replicating hedges can not be determined with certainty .",
    "the existence of volatility risk in derivative trading is a concrete manifestation of market incompleteness .",
    "the problem of model uncertainty has long been recognized in economics and finance . studied a single period portfolio choice problem employing the uncertainty averse preference model developed by . and studied the implications for equilibrium asset prices in the representative agent economics .",
    "cash - subadditive risk measures with interest ambiguity was studied in .",
    "investigated multidimensional risk measures under multiple priors .",
    "see also and references therein for more papers on model uncertainty and multi - prior model .",
    "we do not list them all here .",
    "note that in existing works on model uncertainty ( ) , all probability measures@xmath4 are assumed to be equivalent to a reference probability @xmath5 .",
    "this technical requirement is actually quite restrictive : it means all model agree on a universe scenario and only differ on their probabilities .",
    "an example of diffusion model with uncertain volatility ( ) does not verify this hypothesis .",
    "recent explorations include , and .",
    "volatility of a financial market is difficult to predict .",
    "although we have lots of historical data within hand , the volatility might move as large as she wants and seems to be quite sensitive to new information .",
    "one could approximate short - period volatility but never the long - term one .",
    "there are too many factors determining volatility .",
    "sometimes we assume that the volatility is driven by stochastic elements , e.g. itself is a diffusion process .",
    "such a model is called stochastic volatility model ( ) .",
    "it often has several parameters which can be chosen either to fit historical data or calibrate to the market .",
    "a robust choice to the problem of modeling the unknown volatility is to treat it as uncertain as it actually is .",
    "we just stand on two bounds @xmath6 and @xmath7 to deduce prices representing worst - case scenario and best - case scenario respectively .",
    "the interval [ @xmath8 characterizes the uncertain level of volatility .",
    "larger interval , larger fluctuation of volatility .",
    "also this interval depends on investor s preference or aversion of risk .",
    "a conservative investor may establish a large interval and choose the minimal superstrategy . however a too large interval yields such a high superstrategy that it is meaningless .",
    "we now recall the uncertain volatility model introduced in . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider derivative securities based on a single liquidly traded stock which pays no dividends over the contract s lifetime .",
    "the paths followed by future stock prices are assumed to be it process , @xmath9where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are adapted processes such that@xmath12where @xmath13 is the standard brownian motion under a given probability space @xmath14 . the constants @xmath15 and @xmath16represent upper and lower bounds of the volatility that should be input to the model according to the investor s expectation and uncertainty about future price fluctuations .",
    "these two bounds could be statistically obtained from peaks of volatility in historical stock or option - implied volatilities .",
    "they can be viewed as determining a confidence interval for future volatility values , as pointed in    note that two different volatility processes will typically yield mutually singular probability measures on the set of possible paths .",
    "so volatility ambiguity leads to model uncertainty with a set of risk - neutral probabilities @xmath17 , each of them corresponding to a volatility process with value at each time in @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "naturally we look for the cheapest superhedging price at which we can sell and manage an option in such environment .",
    "a convenient framework is the stochastic control framework , in which the managing volatility is interpreted as a control variable .",
    "it turns out that the value function in such an optimal control will yield the cheapest superstrategy price .",
    "nevertheless , the connection between superstrategy problem and stochastic control is not that obvious .",
    "recall that a stochastic control problem is to maximize an expectation over a set of processes , whereas a superstrategy is over a set of probabilities , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "this issue is avoided in handled partially in , and more formally in and .",
    "a significant progress toward a general framework is available in , which can be viewed as a quasi - sure stochastic analysis .",
    "see also addressing conditioning or updating which is a crucial ingredient in modeling dynamic pricing .    established a path analysis , called g - stochastic analysis , which extends the classical wiener analysis to a framework of sublinear expectation on events field @xmath20 , the space of all @xmath21-valued continuous paths @xmath22 with @xmath23 , equipped with a uniform norm on compact subspaces .",
    "notions such as g - normal distribution , g - brownian motion , g - expectation were introduced ( see appendix [ v.appa ] or peng s review paper , , and summative book , ) .    the representation for g - expectation ( ) , @xmath24 = \\underset{p\\in \\mathcal{p}}{\\sup } % { \\normalsize e}_{p}\\left [ \\cdot \\right]\\]]tells us that g - expectation induces a set of probabilities @xmath17 naturally .",
    "is a weekly compact set .",
    "recently showed that there is a numerable weakly relatively compact set @xmath25 such that the above representation still holds . ]",
    "it is shown that @xmath26 is a martingale under every @xmath4 ( ) and there exists a unique adapted process @xmath27 such that @xmath28 , @xmath29 @xmath30 , @xmath31-@xmath32 and @xmath33where @xmath34 is a standard @xmath35brownian motion .",
    "therefore an interesting phenomenon comes up : the quadratic variance of @xmath36 under any @xmath4 , @xmath37is no longer a deterministic function of time @xmath30 .    all results in g - stochastic analysis work in a model - free way : they hold under all probabilities @xmath4 or quasi - surely(_q.s .",
    "_ ) , i.e. a property holds outside a polar set @xmath38 with @xmath39 for all @xmath40 . as pointed in peng s icm lecture ( ) , g - expectation may appear as a natural candidate to measure volatility risk . in this direction , initial work has been done by n which the main focus is on the no - arbitrage argument .",
    "based on the work of , vorbrink adapted the notion of absence of arbitrage from the market with constraints on portfolio choice to the framework of uncertain volatility model .",
    "the risk premium of portfolio is not considered when modeling the wealth process .",
    "thus technical difficulties to change the subjective risk preference to a risk - neutral world are avoided .",
    "more recently , recursive utility is studied by accommodating mean and volatility ambiguity .",
    "they applied the model to a representative agent endowment economy to study equilibrium asset returns in both arrow - debreu style and sequential radner - style economies .",
    "presents an equilibrium model for two - price economics in which the market clearing condition is defined .",
    "see also for related results using the theory of g - expectation .",
    "the present paper considers mean - volatility uncertainty simultaneously .",
    "as pointed later in the next section , mean - uncertainty occurs often with volatility uncertainty .",
    "the stock price is modeled as a generalized geometric g - brownian motion in which mean - uncertainty may move without regarding to the volatility - uncertainty .",
    "section [ v.sect3 ] derives the superhedging pdes for both state - dependent and discrete - path - dependent options .",
    "what is interesting is that , neither the preference of investors nor the mean - uncertainty appear in the superhedging pdes , which demonstrates that risk - neutral measures exist indeed in such ambiguous environment .",
    "section [ v.sect4 ] extends the classical black - scholes - merton model to the uncertain volatility case .",
    "a superhedging strategy is just a solution of a backward stochastic differential equation driven by g - brownian motion ( g - bsde for short ) .",
    "it is shown that the solution is the minimal superstrategy with no - arbitrage .",
    "in particular , conditions of arbitrage for substrategy are given which are essentially different from vorbink s work .",
    "the finite - variance term @xmath0 is interpreted as profit&loss ( p&l for short ) of an investor .",
    "recall of peng s g - stochastic analysis and some technical results are arranged in the appendix .",
    "we assume the price process of a stock satisfies the following linear stochastic differential equation ( sde for short):@xmath41where @xmath26 is a g - brownian motion - brownian motion . ] .",

    "it follows that @xmath43and @xmath44so the mean of expected continuously compounded rate of return will fluctuate within @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "we do not consider any ambiguity of stock appreciation .",
    "however the mean or the expected rate of return is uncertain .",
    "@xmath46 is not a symmetric random variable at each time t , since we do not necessarily have @xmath47=-\\mathbb{e}[-s_{t}]$ ] .",
    "volatility ambiguity leads to model uncertainty , i.e. , multi - prior model .",
    "naturally the expected value of stock price @xmath48 may be ambiguous under a set of probabilistic models .",
    "this paper will take into account mean - volatility uncertainty simultaneously by peng s g - stochastic analysis .      in the classical black - scholes - merton option - pricing model ,",
    "the price process of a stock is assumed to be it process @xmath49where @xmath50 is the standard brownian motion under a given linear probability space @xmath14 ; @xmath51 is the volatility of the stock price ; @xmath52 is the expected rate of return .",
    "an application of it formula yields@xmath53 which is called geometric brownian motion .",
    "we now consider a stock market with mean - uncertainty and volatility - uncertainty together .",
    "we do not have confidence in which direction the expected rate @xmath54 of return and the volatility @xmath55 will move or even their distribution in future but they are sure to change within @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] .",

    "then model could be rewritten as@xmath64    however , we prefer the following modification about the expected rate of returns : let @xmath65 be the riskless interest rate . if @xmath54 varies in @xmath66 $ ] , then @xmath67 varies in @xmath68 $ ] .",

    "of course we will see later that there does exist a risk - neutral world in which even the uncertainty of expected returns does not influence our super and sub - hedging strategies",
    ".    particularly taking @xmath71 means that the expected returns and volatility move together .",
    "see , and , they consider mean - uncertainty of this type .",
    "an example is referred in example 2.4 and section 3.1.2by specifying    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are fixed and known parameters , which means that @xmath76 and yields@xmath77\\ ] ] or equivalently    @xmath78    showed that such models exist when agents receive bad news of ambiguous precision since bad news lowers both the conditional mean and the conditional variance of returns .      the classical price process of stock yields @xmath79(see ) where @xmath80 is the distribution function of normal distribution .",
    "there is a 95% probability that a normally distributed variable has a value with 1.96 standard deviation of its mean .",
    "hence , with 95% confidence under a single @xmath31 we have @xmath81    typical values of the volatility of a stock are in the range of 20% to 40% per anum and usually we take @xmath82 .",
