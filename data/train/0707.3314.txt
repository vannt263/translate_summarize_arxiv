    "since the pioneering work of bekenstein @xcite and hawking @xcite , which proved that the entropy of black hole is proportional to the area of its horizon in the early 1970s , the research of the black hole thermodynamics has greatly improved .",
    "especially , the proof of the hawking radiation stimulated the enthusiasm for studying the thermal property of the black hole .",
    "it was found that if the surface gravity of the black hole is considered to be the temperature and the outer horizon area is considered to be the entropy , four laws of the black hole thermodynamics , which correspond with the four laws of the elementary thermodynamics , has been established  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "2d dilaton gravity has been used in various situations as an effective description of 4d gravity after a black hole in string theory has appeared @xcite . hawking radiation and thermodynamics of this black hole",
    "has been analyzed by several authors @xcite .",
    "another 2d theories , which were originated from the jackiw - teitelboim ( jt ) theory @xcite , have been also studied @xcite .",
    "although in this theory the curvature is constant and negative , it has a black hole solution , which implies a non - trivial causal structure and in turn generates interesting non - trivial thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , fabbri _ et .",
    "@xcite partially demonstrated the duality of the thermodynamics between near - extremal rn black hole and the jt theory because they considered temperature and entropy only .",
    "recently , grumiller and mcnees  @xcite discussed black hole thermodynamics in the 2d dilaton gravity ( for a review see @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    ", we completely describe the thermodynamic duality between the rn black hole and the 2d dilaton gravity .",
    "the key ingredient is to fully use the dilaton potential induced by the dimensional reduction and the conformal transformation .",
    "moreover , we also show the thermodynamic duality between near - extremal rn black hole and the jt theory .",
    "consider the rn black hole , whose metric is given by @xmath1 with @xmath2 . here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mass and the electric charge of the rn black hole , respectively .",
    "then , the inner ( @xmath5 ) and the outer ( @xmath6 ) horizons are obtained as @xmath7 , which satisfy @xmath8 . for @xmath9 , we have an extremal rn black hole at @xmath10 . in this work",
    "we consider the case of fixed charge @xmath4 for simplicity  @xcite .",
    "the other case of the fixed potential @xmath11 will have parallel with the fixed charge case .",
    "for the rn black hole , the relevant thermodynamic quantities are given by the bekenstein - hawking entropy and hawking temperature @xmath12 then , using the eqs .",
    "( [ as ] ) and ( [ at ] ) , the heat capacity @xmath13 and helmholtz free energy @xmath14 are obtained to be @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "we note here that one has to use the extremal black hole as background for fixed charge ensemble  @xcite .        as is shown in fig .",
    "1 , the features of thermodynamic quantities are as follows : first of all , the whole region splits into the near - horizon phase of @xmath17 with @xmath18 and schwarzschild phase of @xmath19 .",
    "i ) the temperature is zero ( @xmath20 ) at @xmath21 , maximum @xmath22 at @xmath23 , and for @xmath19 , it shows the schwarzschild behavior .",
    "ii ) the heat capacity @xmath24 determines thermodynamic stability . for @xmath17 , it is stable because of @xmath25 , while for @xmath19 , it is unstable ( @xmath26 ) as is shown in the schwarzschild case . here",
    ", we have @xmath27 at @xmath21 , and importantly @xmath24 blows up at @xmath23 .",
    "iii ) the free energy is an important quantity to determine the presumed phase transition .",
    "the free energy is always negative and it is decreasing ( @xmath28 ) for the near - horizon phase and increasing ( @xmath29 ) for the schwarzschild phase .",
    "it takes the minimum value @xmath30 at @xmath23 and @xmath31 at @xmath21 . here",
    ", we classify the extremal rn black hole by the conditions of @xmath32 .",
    "we start with the four - dimensional action whose solution is given by eq.([mf ] ) as @xmath33\\ ] ] with @xmath34 . after the dimensional reduction by integrating over @xmath35 and eliminating the kinetic term by using the conformal transformation @xmath36 the reparameterized action",

    "the two equations of motion are @xmath41 where the derivative of @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 then , we obtain the general solution to eqs .",
    "( [ newat1 ] ) and ( [ newat2 ] ) by choosing a conformal gauge of @xmath44 @xcite as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the integration of @xmath42 given by @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is a coordinate - invariant constant of integration , which is identified with the mass @xmath3 of the rn black hole .",
    "we note here the important connection between @xmath46 and the metric function @xmath49 with @xmath50 : @xmath51 . for @xmath52",
    ", we have the ads@xmath0-horizon which satisfies @xmath53 that is equivalent to @xmath8 .    .",
    "the solid curve describes @xmath46 , the dotted curve gives @xmath54 , the dashed curve denotes @xmath55 , and the near - horizon region is between the dot - dashed lines .",
    "@xmath56(@xmath57 ) represent @xmath58(@xmath59 ) .",
    "the horizontal line at @xmath60 is for the mass perturbation of the eq .",
    "( 23 ) . ]    as is shown in fig .",
    "2 , we observe two important points : one ( @xmath56 ) is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "another ( @xmath57 ) is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "the former shows the extremal configuration , while the latter indicates the unstable maximum point .",
    "all thermodynamic quantities can be explicitly expressed in terms of the dilaton @xmath65 , the dilaton potential @xmath54 , its integration @xmath46 , and its derivative @xmath55 as @xmath66 these are our main results .        in fig .",
    "3 , we have the corresponding dual graphs , which are nearly the same as in fig .",
    "1 . for @xmath67",
    ", we have the jt phase , whereas for @xmath68 , we have the schwarzschild phase . at the extremal point @xmath21",
    ", we have @xmath69 , which are determined by @xmath70 . on the other hand , at the maximum point @xmath23 , one has @xmath71 , which are fixed by @xmath72 .",
    "as is shown in table i , we confirm that the dual relation of four thermodynamic laws can be easily realized by the 2d dilaton and its potential .",
    "the first law is given by the definition of @xmath73 : @xmath74 . concerning on the third law , it has a rather different status from the others .",
    "it was proved that an infinite amount of time is required for the near - extremal rn black hole to decay to extremality at @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we require that it take an infinite time to arrive at @xmath70 from @xmath75 located at the near - horizon phase .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table i ]",
    "it is very interesting to explore the near - horizon thermodynamics to the extremal rn black hole .",
    "this could be obtained by inserting @xmath76 into eqs .",
    "( [ as])-([af ] ) to leading order in @xmath77 .",
    "then , all near - horizon thermodynamic quantities are given by @xmath78 with the definition of @xmath79 .",
    "in general , the near - horizon quantities do not satisfy the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "instead , we find @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which show the same bebavior as in the non - rotating btz black hole  @xcite .    in order to find the ads@xmath0 gravity of the jt theory",
    ", we consider the perturbation around the ads@xmath0-horizon as @xmath82\\equiv q+\\delta m \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . introducing the new coordinates @xmath86 then the perturbed metric function with the perturbed dilaton @xmath87 is given by @xmath88d\\tilde{t}^2    + \\frac{d\\tilde{x}^2}{\\big[\\frac{v'(\\phi_0)}{2}\\tilde{x}^2-kq\\big ] } , \\nonumber\\\\   \\label{metricads}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows a locally ads@xmath0 spacetime .",
    "if @xmath89 , it is a globally ads@xmath0 spacetime .",
    "moreover , the mass deviation @xmath90 is the conserved parameter of the jt theory @xcite .",
    "now , we are in a position to describe the near - horizon thermodynamics from the jt theory . from the null condition of the metric function in eq .",
    "( [ metricads ] ) , we have the positive root @xmath91 then , the jt thermodynamics can be obtained by perturbing the thermodynamic quantities in eq .",
    "( [ phitds ] ) around @xmath58 as @xmath92 as a result , we confirm that @xmath93 .",
    "this means that the near - horizon ( ads@xmath0 ) thermodynamics of the extremal rn black hole can be completely described by the jt theory .",
    "we note that the equality between the near - horizon thermodynamics and jt theory was partially proved for the entropy and temperature up to now  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have completely described the dual relations for all thermodynamic quantities including the heat capacity and free energy .",
    "furthermore , assuming asymptotic symmetry at boundary with a periodicity of @xmath94 in @xmath95 @xcite , we could also show that the jt entropy @xmath96 is equal to the statistical entropy @xmath97 with the central charge @xmath98 and the virasoro generator @xmath99 .",
    "this is a realization of the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath100 correspondence in the near - horizon region .",
    "for the schwarzschild black hole with @xmath101 , we have no point of @xmath102 . here",
    "we have @xmath103 in the schwarzschild phase .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath104 in the 2d dilaton gravity approach .",
    "considering @xmath105 in the schwarzschild phase , we confirm that the thermodynamic duality between the schwarzschild black hole and 2d dilaton gravity holds . also it is clear that the duality is manifested by the conformal transformation ( [ conft ] ) after integration over @xmath35 because it enforces the dilaton potential to be eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have completely described the thermodynamic duality between the rn black hole and the 2d dilaton gravity .",
    "the key ingredient is to fully use the dilaton potential induced by the dimensional reduction and the conformal transformation . even though , for simplicity , we have considered the rn black hole and the schwarzschild black hole with @xmath101 , the dilaton potential is available for all spherically symmetric black holes in four dimensions .",
    "hence , our approach simplifies the study on the black hole significantly such that the 4d black hole thermodynamics can be completely described by the 2d dilaton potential .",
