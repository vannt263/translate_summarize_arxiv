    "skewed - gentle algebras were introduced in  @xcite ; for the notation and definition we follow here mostly  @xcite , but we try to explain how the construction works rather than repeating the technical definition from  @xcite .",

    "a set @xmath219 of vertices of the quiver  @xmath11 is an admissible set of _ special _ vertices if the quiver with relations obtained from  @xmath11 by adding loops with square zero at these vertices is again gentle ; we denote this gentle pair by @xmath220 .",

    "+ more precisely , we proceed as follows .",
    "the non - special ( or : ordinary ) vertices in  @xmath11 are also vertices in the new quiver ; any arrow between non - special vertices as well as corresponding relations are also kept .",
    "any special vertex @xmath223 is replaced by two vertices @xmath224 and @xmath225 in the new quiver .",

    "we say that these new arrows lie over the arrow  @xmath226 .",
    "any relation @xmath232 where @xmath233 is non - special gives a corresponding zero relation for paths of length  2 with the same start and end points lying over  @xmath234 . if @xmath54 is a special vertex of valency  2 in  @xmath11 , then the corresponding zero relation at  @xmath54 , say @xmath232 with @xmath235 , is replaced by mesh commutation relations saying that any two paths of length  2 lying over  @xmath234 , having the same start and end points but running over @xmath224 and  @xmath225 , respectively , coincide in the factor algebra to the new quiver with relations @xmath222 .",

    "+ if a vertex  @xmath54 in  @xmath11 can be chosen as a special vertex for a covering skewed - gentle quiver  @xmath240 , then the corresponding diagonal entry in  @xmath24 is  @xmath29 , as otherwise we have paths of arbitrary lengths in  @xmath241 ; hence in the corresponding @xmath0-cartan matrix for the skewed - gentle algebra  @xmath242 we have @xmath243 on the diagonal for the two split vertices @xmath230 in  @xmath240 .",
