    "there is growing evidence that soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) could be magnetars experiencing starquakes that are connected ( through the intense magnetic field ) to gamma ray flare activity .",
    "magnetars are thought to be neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields , greatly exceeding @xmath2 g @xcite .",
    "the flare activity consist of an initial short peak in the hard part of the spectrum , followed by a decaying softer part ( tail ) which last for hundreds of seconds . recent analysis of detailed observations from several sgrs @xcite revealed that the decaying part of the spectrum exhibits a number of oscillations with frequencies in the range of a few tenths of hz to a few hundred hz .",
    "there are three events detected up to now which can be associated with crust oscillations of magnetars .",
    "the first event was detected already in 1979 from the source sgr 0526 - 66 @xcite , the second in 1998 from sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite , while the third and most energetic one was observed in december 2004 from the source sgr 1802 - 20 @xcite .",
    "analysis of the tail oscillations of sgr 1806 - 20 revealed the presence of oscillations at approximately 18 , 26 , 29 , 92.5 , 150 , 626.5 , and 1837 hz @xcite , for sgr 1900 + 14 the detected frequencies were 28 , 54 , 84 , and 155 hz @xcite , while for the case of sgr 0526 - 66 there was only one frequency identified at 43.5 hz @xcite .",
    "magnetar starquakes may be driven by the evolving intense magnetic field , which accumulates stress and eventually leads to crust fracturing .",
    "the excited seismic oscillations are known to be of two types : _ shear modes _ , which are polar - type oscillations and _ torsional modes _ , which are axial - type oscillations .",
    "the latter are thought to be more easily excited during a fracturing of the crust , since they only involve oscillations of the velocity , with the shear modulus of the crust acting as the necessary restoring force .",
    "slowly rotating stars still maintain a nearly spherical shape and the velocity field of torsional oscillations is then divergence - free , with no radial component .",
    "torsional modes ( _ t_-modes ) are labeled as @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is the angular index , while the index @xmath4 corresponds to the number of radial nodes in the eigenfunctions of the overtones for a specific @xmath0 .",
    "shear and torsional modes have been studied mainly in newtonian theory , see e.g. @xcite , while there are only a few studies of torsional modes in general relativity @xcite .    in the newtonian",
    ", non - magnetized limit @xcite found that the period @xmath5 of the fundamental torsional modes depends mostly on the radius of the star , @xmath6 , the speed of shear waves , @xmath7 , and the angular index @xmath0 , via @xmath8^{-1/2 } r / u_s , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the shear modulus and the density , respectively .",
    "furthermore , it was found that the period of overtones of index @xmath4 is essentially independent of the angular index @xmath12 ( provided @xmath12 does not greatly exceed @xmath4 ) and is basically determined by the crust thickness @xmath13 : @xmath14 from the above two relations it follows that the relative crust thickness , @xmath15 , is given by @xmath16 which is independent of the details of the equation of state in the crust and basically only depends on the ratio of the frequency of the overtones to the fundamental frequency , see also @xcite .",
    "it thus becomes obvious that the successful identification of both the fundamental torsional frequencies and their overtones could allow for the determination of the crust thickness , which in turn could lead to information on the high - density part of the equation of state .",
    "in such a determination , of course , general relativistic and magnetic field effects on the frequencies of torsional modes should properly be taken into account , which is one of the aims of the present paper .",
    "relativistic effects have been found to significantly increase the fundamental @xmath17 torsional mode period by roughly 30% for a typical @xmath18 , @xmath19 model .",
    "@xcite derived the following empirical formula for the period of the fundamental @xmath17 torsional mode of a relativistic star @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in this relation ,",
    "two effects have been taken into account , the ( relativistic ) gravitational redshift and the ( newtonian ) acceleration of gravity @xmath23 at the surface .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "in addition , the formula ( [ eq : duncan ] ) agrees well with the fully relativistic empirical relation found by @xcite @xmath24 the latter is an extension of the newtonian hansen & cioffi formula , based on a particular @xmath25 model . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of a strong magnetic field , @xmath26 , on torsional modes was considered by @xcite and @xcite . assuming that the shear modulus @xmath10 is augmented by the magnetic field tension , @xmath27",
    ", one can derive the following estimate for the period of a torsional mode @xmath28^{-1/2 } , \\label{pb}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the period in the limit of vanishing magnetic field and @xmath30 .",
    "however , @xcite found that if the structure of the magnetic field is close to monopolar in the crust , the period of the fundamental @xmath17 torsional mode does not follow the above relation .",
    "this underlines the importance of properly taking into account the structure of the magnetic field , so that equation ( [ pb ] ) must be generalized to particular magnetic field multipoles .",
    "an essential ingredient in computing torsional mode frequencies is the assumption one makes about the shear modulus @xmath10 .",
    "here , we adopt the zero - temperature limit of the approximate formula derived by @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ion number density , @xmath33 is the average ion spacing , and @xmath34 is the ion charge .",
    "notice that this approximate formula for the shear modulus is derived on the assumption of a bcc crystalline state , which is averaged over all directions . for the detailed composition of the crust",
    ", we consider a modern eos by @xcite ( hereafter dh ) and , for comparison , an older eos by @xcite ( hereafter nv ) .",
    "the two eoss for the crust differ both in composition as well as in the value of the density at the base of the crust . as the crust thickness depends on the compactness of the star , we explore the allowed parameter space for the unknown high - density eos by selecting several tabulated high - density eoss that yield neutron star models with significantly different macroscopic properties .    in the present work ,",
    "we derive the perturbation equations for torsional oscillations of magnetized stars in general relativity following the approach by @xcite and neglecting spacetime perturbations ( cowling approximation ) .",
    "we specialize the magnetic field to a dipole structure , which allows us to reduce the system of equations to only one dimension . a large number of torsional modes ( fundamental and overtones )",
    "is obtained for selected magnetar models differing in the high - density eos , the crust eos and mass .",
    "our study is valid for moderate magnetic field strengths , up to roughly @xmath35 g , assuming that the magnetic field is confined to the crust and neglecting the possible presence of a thin fluid ocean .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : on one hand , for significantly stronger magnetic fields the distortion of the equilibrium shape of the star as well the magnetic coupling to higher harmonics should also be taken into account ; on the other hand , the alfvn velocity @xmath36 @xmath37 cm / s @xmath38 becomes comparable to the speed of shear waves in the crust when the magnetic field reaches values of 10@xmath39 - 10@xmath40 g , which implies that global magnetosonic waves will be strongly coupled to shear waves and the torsional oscillations may no longer be confined to the crust .",
    "the effect of including global magnetosonic waves even at smaller magnetic field strengths should also be studied in more detail , see @xcite .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in the next two sections we describe the general - relativistic ideal mhd equations , the background stellar configuration and the way that we have derived the dipole geometry of the magnetic field . in the fourth section",
    "we derive the perturbation equations for torsional oscillations of magnetized stars in the cowling approximation , while in the fifth section we present the obtained frequencies for selected magnetar models along with fitting formulae for the influence of the magnetic field in the oscillation spectrum .",
    "the article closes with a summary and discussion .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we adopt units of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , while the metric signature is @xmath44 .",
    "the energy momentum tensor @xmath45 for a magnetized relativistic star in equilibrium , is the sum of the stress - energy tensors of a perfect fluid @xmath46 and the magnetic field @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 above , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the energy density , the pressure , and a normalized magnetic field , which we define by absorbing a factor of @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . here and throughout the paper we will assume the _ ideal mhd _ approximation .",
    "in addition , we assume the shear modulus to be isotropic , so that there is no contribution of the shear stress in equilibrium .    using the stress - energy tensor ( [ t_munu ] ) , one obtains the equations of motion of the fluid by projecting the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor on to the hypersurface normal to @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the projection tensor .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath59    due to the ideal mhd approximation the electric field 4-vector vanishes , @xmath60 so that the electric field is zero for a comoving observer . in this approximation",

    "first , we describe the construction of the background equilibrium models .",
    "a strongly magnetized relativistic star has a non - spherical shape , due to the tension of the magnetic field , which is expressed via the off - diagonal components in the stress - energy tensor @xmath45 .",
    "however , the deformations from spherical symmetry induced by the magnetic field are small for neutron stars with magnetic field usually assumed for magnetars , because the energy of the magnetic field is considerably smaller then the gravitational energy , i.e. , @xmath70}\\right)^2.\\ ] ] for this reason , we neglect the deformations due to magnetic fields in the construction of equilibrium models . since magnetars are also extremely slowly rotating ( the intense magnetic field spins down the star on a short timescale ) we can also neglect any rotational deformations , so that the equilibrium models can be considered as spherically symmetric solutions of the well - known tov equations described by a metric of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the function of the schwarzschild radial coordinate @xmath74 .",
    "the four - velocity of the equilibrium model is thus @xmath75    we supplement the equilibrium model by a dipole magnetic field ( but see @xcite for other assumptions ) , following the approach of @xcite i.e. we consider an axisymmetric , poloidal magnetic field , which is created by a 4-current @xmath76 . in ideal mhd",
    "the electromagnetic 4-potential @xmath77 is very simple and has only one component in spherical polar coordinates @xmath78 with @xmath79 @xcite . for the metric chosen above , maxwell s equations @xmath80 lead to the following elliptic equation for @xmath81 @xmath82 the 4-vectors @xmath77 and",
    "@xmath83 can be expanded in vector spherical harmonics , so that @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are functions of the radial coordinate only .",
    "this leads to a one - dimensional form of equation ( [ maxwell - j ] ) @xmath87        for a dipole magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath88 , an analytic exterior solution for @xmath89 exists , setting @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite @xmath92,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the magnetic dipole moment for an observer at infinity . in the interior",
    "the potential @xmath94 is found by solving numerically equation ( [ maxwell - j1 ] ) .",
    "the current distribution @xmath95 , which is the source term of equation ( [ maxwell - j1 ] ) must satisfy the integrability condition that the solution is stationary @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the same , simplified form for the current distribution as the one used in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is an arbitrary constant . moreover , regularity at the center of the star implies that @xmath94 has the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a constant , which is determined by the junction condition with @xmath100 at stellar surface .",
    "finally , the components of the vector @xmath101 describing the normalized magnetic field are given by the following set of equations @xmath102 figure [ fig : dipole_field ] shows the magnetic field lines of the complete solution , for a typical equilibrimum configuration .",
    "we emphasize that , even though the magnetic field configuration has been computed throughout the star , the boundary conditions we will assume for the torsional oscillations will neglect the presence of the magnetic field outside the crust region , so that , effectively , that magnetic field will be assumed to be confined to the crust only .",
    "the perturbation equations are derived by linearizing the equations of motion ( [ conservation ] ) and the magnetic induction equation ( [ maxwell1 ] ) .",
    "since we only consider torsional oscillations , which are of axial type and do not induce density variations in spherical stars , there is no significant variation in the radiative part of the metric describing the gravitational field . in addition , since torsional modes are essentially material velocity oscillations , the imaginary part of their frequency due to the emission of current - multipole gravitational radiation is much smaller than the real part . for these reasons",
    "the frequency of torsional oscillations is determined with satisfactory accuracy even when neglecting entirely the metric perturbations by setting @xmath103 ( i.e. adopting the relativistic cowling approximation ) , see @xcite and we adopt this approximation here .",
