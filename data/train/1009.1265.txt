    "the orbital period therefore gives a rough idea of a system s evolutionary state .",

    "non - eclipsing systems sometimes show periodic photometric modulations , but these do not always appear at @xmath0 ; other phenomena such as superhumps @xcite can mimic orbital modulations .",

    "] for this reason we have therefore been collecting radial - velocity time series for a large number of cvs , with the aim of determining @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we collect together observations and analyses of twenty cvs , all of which proved to have periods well longward of the so - called period gap , a range of @xmath0 from roughly 2 to 3 hours in which relatively few cvs are found @xcite .",

    "the periods of most of these stars are published here for the first time ; a few others are included because we have improved the accuracy of the period .",

    "we measured centroids for the emission lines using convolution techniques explained by @xcite and @xcite , in which the line profile is convolved with an antisymmetric function and the zero of the convolution is taken as the line center .",
    "for the most part we used a convolution function consisting of a positive gaussian and a negative gaussian separated by an adjustable amount .",
    "we usually set the separation of the gaussians to maximize sensitivity to the steep sides of the line profile .",
    "the roche geometry dictates that longer - period cvs will have larger and generally more massive secondary stars than shorter - period cvs , so their secondary stars often contribute significantly to the total light . when possible , we measured absorption line velocities using the cross - correlation radial velocity package _ xcsao _ @xcite . in most cases",
    "the template spectrum was a composite of 76 observations of late - type iau velocity standard stars , which had been shifted individually to zero velocity before averaging ; for later - type secondaries we used a similar template constructed from m dwarfs .",
    "the spectral region used in the cross - correlation was either 6000 to 6500  , or a window from 5100 to 6500  , excluding the complicated region near hei @xmath6 and nad . uncertainties , based on the @xmath7-statistic of @xcite , were typically on the order of 20 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we omitted unphysically large velocities ( which result when the ` wrong ' cross - correlation peak is selected ) and velocities with large estimated uncertainties .",

    "ideally , a graph of @xmath16 as a function of @xmath9 shows a strong spike at the orbital frequency , but the imperfect sampling of the time series inevitably results in aliasing .",
    "we used a monte carlo algorithm developed by @xcite to assess the confidence with which the highest peak in the periodogram can be identified with the true orbital frequency .",

    "this procedure is described in detail in tft04 . for those cvs with absorption - line radial velocity solutions , we shifted the individual spectra into the absorption - line rest frame before averaging them .      as noted earlier , the secondary - star spectrum is often detectable in longer - period cvs .",
    "the absorption - line radial velocities should track the orbital motion of the secondary , though the radial velocities may be affected by irradiation and other effects @xcite .",
    "however , a late - type contribution need not arise from the secondary ; if the late - type spectrum is nearly fixed in velocity , it may come from an unrelated field star , or the outer member of a hierarchical triple ; this appears be the case for v542 cyg , discussed further below .",
    "@xcite and tft04 discuss our spectral decomposition technique and the inferences based on the secondary star , which we summarize briefly here . to estimate the secondary star s spectral type and its contribution to the light , we scale spectra of cool spectral - type standard stars , subtract them from the target spectrum , and look for the best possible cancellation of the late - type features .",
    "this yields estimates of the spectral type of the secondary and its contribution to the total light .",
    "the spectral type constrains the secondary s surface brightness , and the orbital period ( together with the condition that the secondary fills its roche critical lobe ) tightly constrains the secondary s radius @xmath19 .",

    "the period we find , 0.2222033(7 ) d , or 5.33288 hr , agrees within the uncertainties with the @xcite period , but is more precise because of the longer time base .",
    "[ fig : v709casspec ] shows the average spectrum from 1999 october ; the flux level in this spectrum corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "while the spectrum does not cover the higher balmer lines well , we do not see absorption wings around h@xmath27 comparable to those found by @xcite .",
    "we examined the summed spectra from other observing runs , and none of these showed balmer absorption either .",
    "we therefore can not confirm the white dwarf detection claimed by @xcite .",

    "we do see nad features , with each of the d lines having an equivalent width of @xmath37  , but these are sharp and motionless , indicating an interstellar origin .",
    "we feel that the balance of the evidence suggests that the line wings are an intermittent feature of the optically thick disk , and that the system is more luminous and distant than in the @xcite interpretation .",
    "@xcite reported spectroscopy of af cam .",
    "they detected the k - type secondary star , and radial velocity variability in both emission and absorption lines at a weighted mean period of @xmath38 d. we have since observed the star occasionally with the aim of refining @xmath0 and deriving an ephemeris .",

    "@xcite discovered this cv as part of the isaac newton telescope photometric h@xmath25 survey of the northern galactic plane , the strong k - type contribution evident in their spectrum , and the relatively bright magnitude ( @xmath39 ) made this a tempting target for an absorption - line velocity study , which we undertook starting in 2008 january .",
    "the expected modulation did prove to be present in both the h@xmath25 emission velocities and the absorption velocities , with @xmath0 near 7.5 hr .",
    "both time series favor a period near 0.31390 d. an alias period near 0.31609 d , reflecting an alternate choice of cycle count between observing runs , is much less likely .",
    "the secondary spectrum is best matched by a k5.5 @xmath40 1.5 star , but the continuum that remains after the secondary star is removed is unusually red , suggesting that the reddening is substantial .",
    "the galactic latitude is low , @xmath41 , and the @xcite maps give the reddening @xmath42 mag at this location .",
    "we experimented with de - reddening by various amounts . with reddenings @xmath43 ,",
    "the balmer decrement became implausibly steep ( h@xmath27 stronger than h@xmath25 ) , while at small reddenings the continuum remained too red .",
    "the best values appeared to be in the range @xmath44 .",
    "the procedure outlined earlier then led to the inferences in table [ tab : inferences ] .",
    "the distance estimate is very rough , mostly because of the large uncertainty in the reddening .",
    "sinusoidal fits to the emission and absorption velocities show them to be @xmath45 cycles out of phase . in double - lined spectroscopic binaries ,",
    "the ratio @xmath46 gives an estimate of the mass ratio , but in order for this to be accurate , the velocities must trace the center - of - mass motion of the two stars . if this is the case , the phase lag between emission and absorption must be 0.5 cycles  this is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for the estimate to be trustworthy . in the present case ,",
    "this condition is marginally fulfilled  the discrepancy is formally three standard deviations .",

    "the apparent lack of eclipses is therefore not unexpected .",
    "the @xcite evolutionary models that best match this system are those in which mass transfer begins after hydrogen has been substantially depleted in the core .",

    "the 62-minute x - ray modulation was confirmed and refined by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also published an optical spectrum , and noted the features of a cv and a k star .",
    "they obtained @xmath55 and @xmath56 time series photometry that showed ellipsoidal variation at a period of @xmath57 h. @xcite monitored v1062 tau photometrically , and refined the orbital period to @xmath58 h. they also detected the 62-minute period , and the beat between this and the orbit .",
    "their data showed two short , low - amplitude outbursts , with @xmath59 mag .",
    "for the most part , our spectra of v1062 tau appeared similar to the average shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra1 ] , which in turn is generally similar to that shown by @xcite ( their figure 3 ) .",
    "the excitation is high ; heii @xmath60 emission is similar in strength to h@xmath27 , and our long cumulative exposure also shows emission at heii @xmath61 . the @xcite map indicates a reddening @xmath62 at this position ( @xmath63 ) , and the continuum does suggest substantial reddening .",
    "the presence of diffuse interstellar bands near @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite gives further evidence for reddening , and the rather strong na d absorption lines near @xmath66 are almost motionless in the spectrum , indicating that they are mostly interstellar . in computing the secondary - based distance , we assume that v1062 tau is beyond most of the reddening in the @xcite map , which yields a distance of @xmath67 pc , which would put it over 200 pc from the midplane of the galaxy , where it would indeed be expected to be outside most of the dust layer .",
    "our spectrum has a synthetic @xmath55 magnitude near 16.7 .",
    "however , we also obtained two spectra 2002 feb 20.53 ut that show the star much brighter , with synthetic magnitudes near @xmath68 ; another pair of spectra taken at feb 20.78 ut , a few hours later , have @xmath69 and 15.3 . by a remarkable coincidence",
    ", @xcite observed the same outburst earlier in the same night ( from a different longitude ) ; our first pair of spectra was taken some 4.5 hours after their last point . if the decline between our spectra was the decline from outburst , the flare s duration was considerably less than one day .",
    "only a few magnetic cvs have been observed to undergo such short - lived flares @xcite .    in our spectra",
    "the velocity of the late - type feature is modulated at @xmath70 d , or 9.9812(3 ) h , consistent with the @xcite period .",
    "the emission - line velocities include some points from earlier observing seasons ; the signal - to - noise of these spectra was not adequate for measuring absorption - line velocities , but the increased time base does result in a more precise period .",
    "the emission - line velocities do not determine the period on their own ",
    "the single best fit to the emission is near 0.4187 d ( 10.05 h ) .",
    "however , when the absorption line velocities are fitted at the 10.05 h period , the fit is very poor , while the fit to the emission - line velocities at 9.9812 h ( the best absorption - line period ) is reasonably good . because the absorption lines arise in a relatively uncomplicated stellar photosphere",
    ", their velocities should be much less vulnerable to state changes ( and the like ) than those of the emission lines ; because of this , and the good agreement with the independent period determination by @xcite , we are confident that the absorption - line period is essentially correct . in table  [ tab : parameters ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : folpl1 ] we adopt the weighted average of the emission- and absorption - line periods .",
    "the two periods do disagree by 3.6 standard deviations , so some caution is in order extending the ephemeris into the future , but the actual difference of the periods is only 4.3 s.    the spectral decomposition shows the secondary to be of type k5 @xmath71 subclasses . at this orbital period and spectral type , modeling suggests that cv secondaries depleted much of their core hydrogen before the beginning of mass transfer @xcite .",
    "the emission - line velocity modulation is far from antiphased with the absorption ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : folpl1 ] ) , so it is evidently not a faithful tracer of the white dwarf motion . in contrast , the absorption lines should follow the secondary star . without a reliable @xmath72 we can not make firm mass estimates .",
    "however , the absorption velocity amplitude @xmath18 , @xmath73 km s@xmath3 , is fairly large for this @xmath0 , and suggests that the white dwarf is relatively massive and that the inclination is not too far from edge - on . as an illustration , a system @xmath50 = 1 m@xmath52 and @xmath20 = 0.5 m@xmath52 at @xmath74 degree would produce the observed @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xcite do not detect eclipses despite intensive coverage .",
    "our spectrum appears similar to that published by @xcite .",
    "we clearly detect an m - dwarf secondary . the gross period ( table  [ tab : parameters ] )",
    "is based on emission - line velocities .",
    "it is unambiguous , but the fine period is aliased on a scale of one cycle per 47 d due to uncertain cycle count between observing runs ; the allowed precise periods satisfy @xmath75 where the denominator is an integer .",
    "the cross - correlation technique was sensitive enough to measure m - dwarf velocities for some of our spectra , but these were not extensive or accurate enough to shed light on the period ; however , they did confirm that the m - dwarf light is from the binary companion and not from an interloper .",
    "combining our spectra into a single - trailed greyscale representation confirmed the presence of secondary features ; in particular , the cai @xmath76 6122 absorption line appeared faintly , with a velocity semiamplitude of @xmath77 km s@xmath3 .",
    "v344 ori is at @xmath78 , for which @xcite give @xmath79 to the edge of the galaxy .",

    "dwarf novae typically have @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; the very blue @xmath86 suggests near - zero reddening , while the redder @xmath87 suggests @xmath88 .",
    "the poorly - constrained reddening contributes substantially to the distance uncertainty ( table  [ tab : inferences ] ) .",
    "@xcite obtained a spectrum of this rosat all - sky survey source that showed the broad emission lines of a cv . @xcite",
    "obtained more extensive spectrophotometry from which they deduced a spectral type of m2 for the secondary .",
    "they also found a radial - velocity periodicity that corroborated an early version of the period reported here .",
    "nearly all our observations are from 2001 march , but we also have two velocities from 2000 april . the period measured in 2001 march",
    "is not precise enough to extrapolate the cycle count to the previous year , but the extra data do constrain the precise period to a group of aliases which can be expressed as @xmath89 where the denominator is an integer .",
    "the m - dwarf contribution to the spectrum was strong enough that we could measure absorption velocities for the majority of our spectra by cross - correlating the m - dwarf radial velocity template over the 6000 to 6500   region .",
    "the absorption velocities were not precise enough to yield an accurate @xmath18 , but they did move approximately in antiphase to the emission , confirming that the m dwarf contribution arises from the binary companion .",
    "we also estimated the secondary star s spectral type , and found the best match around m1 @xmath40 1 subtype , slightly earlier than the type found by @xcite .",
    "this is just a little warmer than is typical at this @xmath0 ( 3.57 hr ) ; the @xcite models that predict this early spectral type begin with relatively massive secondaries and have depleted nearly all the core hydrogen at the start of mass transfer .",
    "@xcite identified this object as a cv , most likely a dwarf nova of the ugss subclass , after patrick wils first called attention to the nature of its light curve from the northern sky variability survey .",
    "it appears in the sloan digital sky survey , but was not selected for a spectrum , probably because its colors ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ) place it near the ` stellar locus ' used to exclude spectroscopic targets @xcite .",
    "this illustrates that while the sdss has been extraordinarily effective at finding new cvs and illuminating their properties @xcite , it does not find all the cvs within its footprint ( and indeed , @xcite warn that sdss does not claim completeness for cvs ) .",
    "our spectra show modulation of both the emission and absorption at essentially the same period , with a secure cycle count on all timescales over the 1456 d span of our data set .",
    "the weighted average @xmath0 is 0.376308(1 ) d ( 9.03 hr ) .",
    "if we define orbital phase @xmath95 at the blue - to - red crossing of the absorption velocities through their mean velocity @xmath96 , then the emission velocities cross blue - to - red at @xmath97 , which is close to the antiphased behavior expected if the emission lines trace the white - dwarf velocity .",
    "if the emission lines do in fact trace the white - dwarf velocity ( which is far from proven ) , @xmath98 , yielding @xmath99 . from @xcite , we find @xmath100 for a k4 or k5 secondary star with a @xmath0 of roughly 9 h ; this gives @xmath101 from @xmath53 .",

    "pc ( table  [ tab : inferences ] ) , this object is at least several hundred pc away from the galactic plane , so it may belong to the thick disk . the secondary s spectrum does not appear unusual , so it is probably not a low - metallicity halo object .",
    "it does not have a significant proper motion listed in the usnob1.0 @xcite or ucac3 @xcite catalogs .",
    "the general catalog of variable stars @xcite lists this star as having variability type is , that is , showing rapid irregular variability . @xcite",
    "assign a superhump period of 0.12 d ( 2.88 hr ) , which would imply that @xmath0 is slightly shorter than that , which would put v478 her in the ( roughly ) 2- to 3-hour ` period gap ' .",
    "the source for the 2.88-hr period is a photometric time series , 3.7 hours in duration , taken by t. vanmunster on 2001 june 7 ut , during an outburst .",
    "this observation showed a variation that vanmunster interpreted as a probable superhump ; on this basis , the star is listed in the final edition of the @xcite cv catalog as an su - uma type dwarf nova .",
    "we were therefore puzzled when our initial observations showed no sign of a short - period radial velocity modulation , despite sufficient signal - to - noise in the h@xmath25 emission lines to make such a modulation apparent if it were present .",
    "more extensive observations extending over several seasons indicate that @xmath0 is much longer than had been thought , over 15 h. the secondary spectrum is just detectable , and the radial velocities of both the the h@xmath25 emission line and the absorption spectrum show the long period .",
    "the short period appears to be mistaken , and the star has therefore been misclassified . because of its short duration , the light curve on vanmunster s site shows only a single minimum , and we note that he characterized his detection of superhumps as `` likely '' , rather than definitive .",
    "we do not have time series photometry , and so can not comment further on the cause of the variation he detected .",

    "the orbital period of v478 her is unusually long for a cv  it lies well outside the range tabulated by @xcite , so the secondary - star mass range given in table  [ tab : inferences ] is even more of a guess than usual .",
    "even so , the long orbital period ( hence large roche lobe ) , warm secondary , and faint apparent magnitude indicate that v478 her very distant for a cv ; at @xmath107 and @xmath108 , it is also at least 1 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "this is an old nova , having outburst in 1898 .",
    "@xcite describe the spectrum as having a noisy flat continuum , with balmer and heii emission .",
    "the continuum in our spectrum is indeed fairly flat , but also shows weak broad undulations that superficially suggest a companion s contribution .",
    "however , we could not generate a convincing spectral decomposition with our library spectra , so these might not indicate a companion . in part because of the unfavorable declination , we had to observe this target on several observing runs before we were certain about the gross period .",
    "this led to an uncertain cycle count between runs , which in turn created a complex structure of fine - scale aliases .",
    "the 6.87 h period given in table  [ tab : parameters ] is based on the velocities from our most extensive single observing run .",
    "@xcite found that the v1082 sgr shows high and low states ; when it is in a high photometric state ( @xmath109 14.0 - 14.5 ) , it shows emission lines , with heii @xmath60 comparable in strength to h@xmath27 , while in its low state ( @xmath109 15.0 - 15.5 ) , the emission lines disappear .",
    "a k - type absorption spectrum is present as well , so they suggested that v1082 sgr may be a symbiotic star .",
    "the orbital period we find , near 0.868 d , would be very short for a symbiotic , and is consistent with a long - period novalike variable .",
    "the swift satellite detected v1082 sgr in hard x - rays ( 14  195 kev ; @xcite ) ; it is one of 29 cvs found in the swift bat 22-month survey catalog , most of which have proven to be magnetic cvs of the dq her ( or intermediate polar ) subtype @xcite .",
    "our spectra confirm the state behavior noted by @xcite , but we never did see the emission lines disappear entirely .",
    "strong he ii @xmath60 is often seen in magnetic cvs ; this , combined with the hard x - ray detection , suggests that this is indeed a magnetic system .",
    "time - series measurements in the optical and x - ray might reveal a white - dwarf spin period .",
    "it proved difficult to get a good match to the secondary spectrum , so the spectral type in table  [ tab : inferences ] is fairly uncertain .",
    "the unusually long period puts it outside the realm of the @xcite models , so a wide range of @xmath20 is assumed in the distance calculation ; fortunately , this has little effect on @xmath19 .",
    "the @xcite map gives @xmath110 at this location ( @xmath111 ) ; this is small enough so that it does not contribute significantly to the distance uncertainty , which is dominated by the crude spectral decomposition .",
    "this dwarf nova is among the few studied by @xcite that does not have a known orbital period .",
    "the velocities from 2007 june and july define a period of 0.21777(4 ) d , or 5.23 h. we also have a few velocities in 2005 and 2006 . the cycle count from year to year is ambiguous , but the two most likely choices give periods of 0.217735(3 ) d and 0.217856(4 ) d , which differ in frequency by one cycle per 393 d. some of our spectra were taken above minimum light .    while an early m - type secondary star spectrum is evident , it did not yield usable radial velocities .",
    "the spectral type and contribution were fairly uncertain , so the inferences in table  [ tab : inferences ] are fairly crude .",
    "the interstellar extinction at this position ( @xmath112 @xmath113 ) is fairly sizeable ",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath114 to the edge of the dust layer  and the summed spectrum does show weak diffuse interstellar bands . as a result of all these factors ,",
    "the final distance estimate is uncertain by a factor of around 2 .",
    "v587 lyr , also designated tk 5 , was discovered by @xcite , who classified it as a dwarf nova based on the observation of two outbursts on astrograph plates .",
    "the 6.6-hour orbital period found here is within the normal range for dwarf novae .",
    "the spectrum shows a clear contribution from a k - type secondary , and broad emission lines that appear rather weaker than those in otherwise similar stars .",
    "all of our usable spectra are from a single observing run in 2006 june .",
    "because the absorption velocities quickly yielded @xmath0 , we took a comparatively small number of spectra .",
    "we also obtained standardized @xmath22 photometry on 2003 june 19.34 and 2006 august 29.20 ; the 2003 june observation gave @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , and the 2006 august observation was very similar .",
    "as is typical , the uncertainty in the distance estimate ( table  [ tab : inferences ] ) is dominated by the uncertainty in the secondary s spectral type .",
    "v792 cyg was discovered by @xcite , who found several typical u gem - type outbursts on photographic plates . @xcite",
    "published a spectrum taken with the source well above minimum light , and noted a possible secondary - star contribution .",
    "we have observations from runs in 2007 july and 2007 august , which were separated by about 35 days .",
    "the cycle count between those two runs is ambiguous .",
    "both the absorption and emission velocities slightly favor a period of 0.2972(1 ) d , but periods of 0.2996(1 ) and 0.2948(1 ) d are also possible .",
    "these alternate periods differ by about 3 minutes from the most likely choice , so the rough period is well - determined .",
    "the period quoted in table  [ tab : parameters ] is computed assuming the most likely choice of cycle count is correct , but the monte carlo simulation gives a discriminatory power of only @xmath119 for the alias choice .",
    "the @xmath54 k5 spectral type of the secondary is about as expected given the 7.1 h period @xcite .",
    "the mass ratio indicated by the ratio of the absorption and emission velocity amplitudes is @xmath120 , but the emission line radial velocity modulation differs from antiphase with the absorption by @xmath121 cycles , so this calculation is somewhat suspect . for component masses broadly typical of cvs ( @xmath122 m@xmath52 , @xmath123 m@xmath52 ) , the @xmath47-velocities indicate an orbital inclination of @xmath124 .",
    "the system is therefore unlikely to eclipse .",
    "this star was mis - identified in earlier editions of the downes catalog , but we were able to contribute a correction based on our imaging , and the correct object is indicated in @xcite .",
    "the identification images show the star at @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 .",
    "the radial velocities are from two observing runs only @xmath129 d apart , followed by another several months later .",
    "the choice of cycle count between these runs is fairly secure , so the 4.35 h period ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) is nearly unambiguous , but it is marginally possible that the true orbital frequency is higher by @xmath130 cycle d@xmath131 ( corresponding to a period @xmath132 min shorter ) .",
    "the @xcite maps give a total @xmath133 in this direction ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) .",
    "we found that the secondary spectrum fit was easiest when we de - reddened the spectrum by this amount .",
    "this is somewhat puzzling , since our measured colors ( especially @xmath86 ) are typical for an unreddened dwarf nova . in view of this",
    "we assume a generous uncertainty in the reddening when computing the secondary - based distance ( table  [ tab : inferences ] ) .",
    "our averaged spectrum resembles that obtained by @xcite , who described it as a  text - book example of a cv spectrum \" .",
    "the 3.76-hour period is short compared to most of the objects studied here , and we do not detect the secondary star s contribution .",
    "most of our data are from observing runs in 2007 june and 2007 july , only @xmath136 d apart , and the cycle count between these runs is secure ; we also have a few observations from 2005 .",
    "the cycle count between 2005 and 2007 is unknown , but the precise periods allowed by the data are well - fitted by @xmath137 where the denominator is an integer .",
    "@xcite present a spectrum of this star , which they describe as ` extremely faint ' at the time of their observations ; they did not convincingly detect emission lines , and pronounced the dwarf - nova classification as ` doubtful ' on the basis of the spectrum .",
    "our spectrum appears much more robust , with strong , broad balmer lines and the 4.36-hour orbital period is typical of dwarf novae , so we confirm that v542 cyg is indeed a cv .",
    "we have one set of direct images taken 2005 sep .  15.20 ut with the hiltner 2.4 m telescope , and calibrated with observations of @xcite standard stars ; these gave @xmath138 , @xmath139 @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .",
    "for comparison , the flux - calibrated spectrum published by @xcite implies @xmath142 , so it seems possible that they did not have the star in the slit ( they found some of their fainter targets by blind offset ) .",
    "there is an obvious late - type contribution in our spectrum .",
    "the late - type contribution appears to explain the coexistence of the blue @xmath86 color with the relatively red @xmath87 and @xmath143 colors .",
    "however , the late - type component does not show a significant radial - velocity modulation at the period derived from the emission lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : folpl2 ] ) , so the late - type spectrum clearly is not from the secondary",
    ". the late - type spectrum could be from an interloper elsewhere along the line of sight , but in our best direct image ( in the @xmath56-band ) , the point - spread function has a fwhm of 1.0 arcsec ( at 0.275 arcsec pixel@xmath3 ) , yet v542 cyg shows no sign of incipient resolution . in addition , the position of the blended image does not shift between the images in different filters , with an upper limit of @xmath144 arcsec .",
    "the @xmath145-filter image should be dominated by the cv , while the @xmath56-filter light is dominated by the late - type contribution , so the lack of a shift means that the two objects are co - located in the sky to good accuracy .",
    "this suggests that the late - type contributor is physically associated with the cv , even if it is not the roche - filling companion .",
    "v542 cyg would seem to be a triple system .      v. goranskij clarified the identification of this star ; he noted its blue color and that it appears to be in outburst on the first palomar observatory sky survey , and suggested that it may be a cataclysmic binary .",
    "our spectra show the typical dwarf nova emission lines , confirming his suggestion .",
    "nearly all of our spectra were taken in quiesence ; they are from two closely - spaced observing runs runs in 2007 june and july .",
    "the h@xmath25 emission - line radial velocities give a best period of 0.24675 d ; a much less likely choice of cycle count between the observing runs yields 0.2436 d. in some of the spectra we were able to measure the velocity of the secondary star .",
    "the absorption velocities were less accurate than the emission velocities , but they independently gave the same orbital period .",
    "the secondary s spectral type , m1.5 @xmath40 1.0 , is approximately as expected for the 5.9-h orbital period @xcite .",
    "@xcite reviewed the discovery history of this star and published a spectrum that shows it somewhat brighter and bluer than our mean spectrum .",
    "they described their spectrum as resembling that of a dwarf nova on the decline from outburst , while ours appears to represent a more nearly quiescent state .",
    "the continuum shows weak , broad features that resemble the absorption bands of a secondary star , but we were unable to match these convincingly to our spectral - type standards , so they may not arise from a secondary .",
    "our data come from two short runs separated by two years ; the 4.1 h period is present in both data sets , and is definitive in the combined data , but the cycle count between runs is not determined .",
    "our spectrum resembles the one obtained by @xcite , except that the flux level in our spectrum is somewhat lower and the emission equivalent width appears to be greater . like them",
    ", we detect an m - type companion ; they estimated the spectral type to be in the range m0 to m5 , and from that estimated the distance to be @xmath146 pc , for their latest possible spectral type .",
    "they did not have a @xmath0 with which to constrain the size of the roche lobe .",
    "our 3.85 h period is based on h@xmath25 radial velocities from a single observing run in 2005 september .",
    "we obtained photometry in 2005 september that showed the star near @xmath147 on two separate nights ; the synthesized @xmath55 magnitude from our mean spectrum is also near 18.0 . using the secondary star spectrum ( table  [ tab : inferences ] ) we find vz aqr to be considerably greater than the minimum distance found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found an empirical relationship between the absolute visual magnitudes of dwarf novae at maximum light and their orbital periods .",
    "this predicts @xmath148 at vz aqr s period .",
    "vz aqr reaches @xmath149 , which would imply a distance near 320 pc .",
    "given this , our estimate of @xmath150 pc is probably somewhat greater than the true distance .",
    "as noted above , the normalization of the spectrum used for the distance calculation is corroborated by the photometry derived from direct imaging .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the distance calculation is the spectral classification of the secondary star .",
    "a closer distance would suggest a spectral type somewhat cooler than our estimate .",
    "the x - ray source rxj2133.7 + 5107 was discovered by the @xmath151 galactic plane survey as an x - ray source , and subsequently identified as a dq her - type cv by @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented photometry which revealed a 570 s modulation , related to the white - dwarf spin period , and spectroscopy showing a radial - velocity period of 7.193(16 ) h , or 0.2998(7 ) d , which is evidently @xmath0 .",
    "our h@xmath25 radial velocities show modulation at 0.297432(3 ) d ; while this close to @xcite period , it differs by 3.4 standard deviations .",
    "the interval between our first and last observations is 624 days , and there is no ambiguity in the cycle count over that time . @xcite observed the star on two brief runs some six years apart , and were naturally unable to determine the cycle count between their two epochs , so our period should supersede theirs .",
    "our average spectrum ( not shown ) is very similar in appearance to that that that published by @xcite .",
    "the only new information we present for this star is the improved period .",
    "our main goal in observing these stars was to determine their orbital periods , or , if the periods were already known , to refine them .",
    "the objects discussed here were selected to be those with longer orbital periods . at longer periods",
    "the secondary star tends to be more conspicuous than at shorter periods ; in accordance with expectation , we detect the secondary star s spectrum in most of these objects .",
    "the secondaries spectral types are approximately as expected @xcite for the orbital periods we find .",
    "most of the present sample appear to be typical long - period dwarf novae , without obvious abnormalities .",
    "other types in the cv zoo are also represented .",
    "some of our more noteworthy ( or at least unanticipated ) findings are as follows .    1 .",
    "we do not confirm the presence of a white - dwarf contribution in v709 cas @xcite and argue that it is probably not detectable .",
    "2 .   iphas 0345 resembles a long - period dwarf nova , strongly dominated by its secondary - star contribution , but it has never been observed to outburst . in this respect",
    "it resembles ly uma .",
    "we find that v478 her is a long - period novalike variable , rather than a short - period su uma - type dwarf nova .",
    "we report the first secondary - star radial velocity curve for the dq her star v1062 tau , and confirm reports of flaring activity in the literature .",
    "5 .   in v542 cyg",
    ", we find a contribution from a late - type star that is evidently not the secondary star , and argue that it is likely to be a triple system .",
