    "the presence of a harmonic series of `` acoustic '' peaks in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) was predicted as early as 1970 @xcite .",
    "these peaks arise due to the evolution of pressure waves in the pre - recombination universe and are a generic feature @xcite of most , but not all , cosmological models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , a well - defined set of peaks is predicted for both adiabatic and some classes of isocurvature models of structure formation , but not for models that rely on topological defects .    since the cobe measurement of the amplitude of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background at the largest scales @xcite ,",
    "a large literature has developed which predicts , in the context of adiabatic cold dark matter ( cdm ) models , the relative position and amplitude of these peaks for different values of the fundamental cosmological parameters .",
    "a general prediction of these models is the presence of a dominant fundamental peak at an angular scale @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , decreasing in angular scale when @xmath10 decreases .",
    "data from a variety of experiments @xcite including a small fraction of the data from the boomerang 1998/1999 long duration ballooning ( boom / ldb ) campaign ( @xcite ; b00 hereafter ) clearly show this feature and provide strong evidence for a low curvature universe , a generic prediction of many inflation models .",
    "there is also convincing evidence that the broad - band average of power at smaller angular scales gradually declines in a manner consistent with adiabatic cdm models @xcite .",
    "however , these experiments do not have the necessary combination of sensitivity and sky coverage to convincingly detect or reject the presence of harmonics of the fundamental peak in the power spectrum .",
    "the detection of such harmonic peaks would provide strong evidence that the scenario of structure formation from acoustic oscillations in the primordial plasma is accurate .",
    "present here is an analysis of a larger set of data than previously released from the boom / ldb @xcite experiment which shows clear evidence of multiple peaks in the angular power spectrum of the cmb .",
    "data from four separate detectors that each observe 1.8% of the sky are combined .",
    "a new data analysis algorithm is used and refined estimates of the beam shape and overall experimental calibration are presented . the spectrum is consistent with low spatial curvature , @xmath11-dominated adiabatic cdm models .",
    "boomerang is a long duration balloon ( ldb ) experiment designed to measure the angular power spectrum of the cmb at degree and sub - degree scales . for a complete description of the instrument see @xcite and @xcite .",

    "observations are made simultaneously in four unpolarized bands centered at 90 ghz , 150 ghz , 240 ghz and 410ghz .",
    "the telescope is steerable in azimuth by moving the entire gondola , and in elevation by moving an inner frame containing both the receiver and the optics .",
    "the illumination of the optics is not modulated by the scan , which minimizes scan synchronous optically generated offsets .",
    "extensive shielding permits observations in the azimuth range @xmath29 from the anti - sun direction , for all sun elevations experienced in the antarctic ballooning environment .",
    "observations are made by scanning the telescope in azimuth by @xmath30 peak - to - peak at an angular velocity of @xmath31 ( hereafter 2dps ) ( for the first half of the flight ) or @xmath32 ( hereafter 1dps ) ( for the second half of the flight ) at fixed elevation .",
    "each day , the elevation is shifted .",
    "observations are made at elevations of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the scans are centered well away from the galactic plane .",
    "interspersed in the cmb observations are observations of selected point sources near the galactic plane .",
    "the cmb sky coverage is shown in figure  [ fig : coverage ] .",
    "the results in this paper contain data from the entire boom / ldb flight ( as compared to the second half only in b00 ) and incorporate data from 4 150 ghz channels ( as opposed to 1 for b00 ) .",
    "this was enabled by using the new data analysis techniques described in section  [ sec : dataanalysis ] and in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the most significant source of systematic uncertainty at multipoles , @xmath36 is the effective beam size ( dominated by pointing uncertainties ) . since the release of b00 , the understanding of the beam and pointing has been significantly improved , allowing computation of the power spectrum out to higher multipoles .",
    "observations of extra galactic sources in the main map and scanned observations of bright hii regions near the galactic plane are used to estimate the beam full width half maxima ( fwhm ) for each channel .",
    "these values are presented in table [ table_inst ] .",
    "while these observations provide good statistics on the width of the main lobe , the signal to noise of these data are not sufficient to fully characterize the near sidelobe response and deviation from gaussianity of the beam . to obtain a detailed model of the near sidelobe response of the telescope ,",
    "a physical optics calculation of the beam shape is performed for each channel using the measured position of the horns in the focal plane . to check the precision of the model calculations , a comparison with near field beam maps",
    "azimuthal cuts through the telescope beams are measured to the @xmath37 db level .",
    "while the channels utilizing conical feed horns compare well with the beam map data , a @xmath38 discrepancy is observed between the calculated and measured fwhm of the photometer beams . in all cases ,",
    "the measured fwhm are larger than the calculated beam size .",
    "this discrepancy is attributed to the multi  moded nature of the winston concentrators utilized by these channels . for these channels",
    "the fwhm are scaled to fit the measurements of rcw38 .",
    "to correct for the extended nature of the source , the angular extent of rcw38 was measured independently by the acbar instrument to be @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the two dimensional far - field radiation patterns from the physical optics calculation are then used to generate the window functions for each channel .",
    "the telescope pointing is determined using a combination of rate - gyros and an azimuth sun sensor . in order to recover the long time scale pendulations ,",
    "the gyroscopes are integrated with a 400s time constant .",
    "given the quoted noise in the gyroscopes of less than @xmath40 , a pointing uncertainty of less than 2.7 ( @xmath41 ) is predicted .",
    "the galactic plane point source observations give a pointing uncertainty of 2.5 ( @xmath41 ) . in the analysis ,",
    "the calculated beam is convolved with the gaussian approximation of the pointing uncertainty .",
    "the pointing solution has been improved in this analysis ( compared with b00 ) by better use of the pitch and roll rate gyros , and the regression of a thermally dependent offset in the elevation . a re - analysis of the pointing jitter in the b00 pointing solution , utilizing the apparent centroids of point sources along the galactic plane yields an effective beam size of @xmath42 , for the original pointing solution ( as compared to the quoted @xmath43 used in b00 ) .",
    "when the calibration and beam uncertainties are taken into account , the new results lie , bin by bin , within the overall uncertainty of the b00 spectrum , which was restricted to @xmath44 < /= 600 .",
    "the b00 results are systematically lower at high @xmath44 than those presented here , due to the smaller effective beam that was assumed for the b00 analysis .",
    "however , it is reassuring to note that correcting the b00 spectrum with the new estimate of the b00 pointing jitter eliminates any residual discrepancy between the new results and the b00 spectrum @xcite .",
    "the gain calibrations of the 150 ghz channels are obtained from observations of the cmb dipole .",
    "the data are high - pass filtered with a filter described by @xmath45 for @xmath46 and 1 elsewhere . in order to retain more large - scale information than is needed in the anisotropy analysis ,",
    "@xmath47 is set to the relatively low value of 0.01  hz . to compare with the data",
    ", we artificially sample the cmb dipole signal @xcite , corrected for the earth s velocity around the sun @xcite , according to the boomerang scanning , and filter this fake time stream in the same way as the data .",
    "the 1dps data is then fit simultaneously to this filtered dipole , a similarly filtered dust emission model @xcite , an offset and the boomerang 410 ghz data for all data more than @xmath48 below the galactic plane .",
    "the dipole calibration numbers obtained with this fit are robust to changes in galactic cut , and to whether or not a dust model is included in the fit ; this indicates that dust is not a serious problem for the contamination .",
    "they are insensitive to the inclusion of a 410 ghz channel in the fit , which is a general indication that there is no problem with a wide range of systematics such as atmospheric contamination , as these would be traced by the 410 ghz data .",
    "overall , the calibration of the spectrum has risen by 10% in @xmath49 ( 5% in @xmath50 ) compared to b00 due to a refinement of the dipole calibration ( improved treatment of the time stream filters ) and is further raised by a better calculation of the beam sidelobes .",
    "the data are analyzed in four basic steps : i ) the reduction of the raw data into pointed and flagged time streams , ii ) the estimation of the noise via an iterative map - making algorithm , iii ) the estimation of the angular power spectrum via monte - carlo calibrated spherical harmonic transforms , and iv ) estimation of parameters by likelihood methods . the size and nature of the boomerang data",
    "have required the development of new techniques .    in the reduction of the raw bolometer data , the filter response of the detector and associated electronics",
    "is deconvolved from the time stream , and transient phenomena ( predominantly cosmic rays ) are flagged and replaced in the time stream with a constrained realization of the noise .",
    "similarly , the ra / dec pointing for each channel is reconstructed from the rate gyros , azimuth sun sensor angle , gps co - ordinates of the package , and the focal plane geometry .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the receiver noise for each channel is estimated from the raw time stream by iteratively solving simultaneously for the detector noise spectrum @xmath51 and the maximum likelihood cmb map , @xmath52 .",
    "the algorithm used is an approximate jacobi method :    0.5 cm 0.5 cm    where is @xmath53 is the time - time correlation matrix , @xmath54 is the pointing matrix , @xmath55 is the time - stream data , and @xmath56 is the noise time stream . if the noise is stationary , then @xmath57 is diagonal in fourier space , and multiplication by @xmath57 is just a convolution . and multiplication by @xmath58 represents binning into pixels and dividing by hits per pixel . for details",
    "see @xcite . a complete map and",
    "noise spectra takes about 15 minutes on an alpha - ev67 computer .",
    "two closely related estimators were used to recover the underlying cmb power spectrum @xmath59 from the data .",
    "both methods are based on the monte carlo spherical harmonic transform ( _ master _ ) technique described in @xcite .",
    "_ master _ allows fast and accurate determination of @xmath60 _ without _ performing the extremely time consuming matrix - matrix manipulations that characterize exact methods and limit their applicability ( @xcite ) .",
    "it can be summarized as follows .",
    "the spherical harmonic transform of a naively binned map of the sky is calculated using a fast @xmath61 method based on the healpix tessellation of the sphere @xcite .",
    "the angular power in the noisy maps , @xmath62 , can be related to the true angular power spectrum on the full sky , @xmath59 , by the effect of finite sky coverage ( @xmath63 ) , time and spatial filtering of the maps ( @xmath64 ) , the finite beam size of the instrument ( @xmath65 ) , and instrument noise ( @xmath66 ) as    @xmath67    the coupling matrix @xmath63 is computed analytically , @xmath65 is determined by the measured beam , @xmath64 is determined from monte - carlo simulations of signal - only time streams , and @xmath68 from noise - only simulations of the time streams .",
    "the simulated time streams are created using the actual flight pointing and transient flagging .",
    "the signal component of the simulated time streams is generated from simulated cmb maps and the noise component from realizations of the measured detector noise @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath68 are determined by averaging over @xmath69 and @xmath24 realizations respectively .",
    "once all of the components are known the estimation is carried out in two ways .    in the first case",
    "the power is determined by solving directly for the unbiased estimator @xmath59 of eqn .",
    "[ eqn_cl ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the estimated top - hat binned @xmath59 spectrum are measured by averaging over ensembles ( typically @xmath70 realizations ) of signal+noise simulations created using a best fit model power spectrum obtained from the data .",
    "this allows one to calculate the quantities needed to approximate the full likelihood function for the binned @xmath59 , using the formalism of @xcite .    in the second case a suitable quadratic estimator of the _ full sky _ spectrum in the _ cut sky",
    "variables @xmath71 together with it s fisher matrix is constructed via the coupling matrix @xmath72 and the transfer function @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the underlying power is recovered through the iterative convergence of the quadratic estimator onto the maximum likelihood value as in standard maximum likelihood ( ml ) techniques . a great simplification and speed - up",
    "is obtained due to the diagonality of all the quantities involved , effectively avoiding the @xmath73 large matrix inversion problem of the general ml method .",
    "the extension of the quadratic estimator formalism to montecarlo techniques such as master have the added advantage that the fisher matrix characterizing the uncertainty in the estimator is recovered directly in the iterative solution and does not rely on any potentially biased signal+noise simulation ensembles .",
    "the two procedures agree to within a few percent in the estimated values with the quadratic estimator giving slightly more optimal errors ( at the @xmath74 level ) over the sample variance limited range of the data .",
    "the parameter extraction pipeline was run over results from both methods and the two were found to agree to within the numerical accuracy of the fits .",
    "the drawback of using naively binned maps in the pipeline is that the aggressive time filtering completely suppresses the power in the maps below a critical scale @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "this results in one or more bands in the power spectrum running over modes with no power and which are thus unconstrainable . in pratice",
    "we deal with this by binning the power so that all the degenerate modes lie within the first band @xmath76 and regularize the power in the band at dmr power in the likelihood analysis .",
    "the estimate in the second band @xmath77 will be correlated to this regularized value and as such may be also be considered to be biased by a prior theoretical input .",
    "we therefore discard the estimates in the first two bands thus avoiding any correlation to the regularizing scheme used to constrain the power on the largest scales .",
    "an area equivalent to @xmath78 of the sky was analysed .",
    "the region is enclosed in an ellipse with @xmath79 and @xmath80 degree semi - axes centred at @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the data and simulations were pixelised with @xmath83 arcminute pixels ( healpix @xmath84 ) .",
    "the simulations were run at an angular resolution up to @xmath85 .",
    "inspection of the boomerang maps shows faint stripes of nearly constant declination , ( hereafter `` isodec '' strips ) which vary in amplitude and phase between bolometer channels .",
    "the striping patterns vary on day time scales , and are not reproduced in simulated maps made with the same scan pattern and best estimated noise correlations from the time stream data .    to eliminate this contaminant , all modes with a small @xmath86 ( which corresponds to isodec stripes )",
    "are removed with a fourier filter .",
    "while this clearly eliminates isodec stripes , it also filters out cmb signal .",
    "this is accounted for by applying the same filter to the simulated maps in the _ master _ procedure , so that the effects are included in the determination of @xmath64 .",
    "the removal of the stripes still permits an unbiased estimate of the power spectrum of the sky , but does cause a considerable increase in the uncertainties at large angular scales .",
    "the inclusion of several channels is achieved by averaging the maps ( both from the data , and from the monte - carlos of each channel ) before power spectrum estimation .",
    "weighting in the addition is by hits per pixel , and by receiver noise at 1hz .",
    "each channel has a slightly different beam size , which must be taken into account in the generation of the simulated maps .",
    "any inaccuracy in assuming a common @xmath65 in the angular power spectrum estimation is then absorbed into @xmath64 .",
    "the calculation of the full angular power spectrum and covariance matrix for the four good 150 ghz channels of boomerang ( 57103 pixels and @xmath87 time samples ) takes approximately 1 day running on 8 amd - athlon 800 mhz work stations .",
    "the boomerang observing strategy allows for a rich set of internal consistency checks , implemented as a variety of difference maps in which the sky signal should cancel .",
    "the power spectra of these difference maps are sensitive to improper characterization of the receiver noise , and contamination not fixed to the celestial sphere .",
    "the precision of these difference tests are much more powerful than a comparison of the power spectra , since the sample variance contribution to the power spectrum error bars is proportional to the signal found in each bin , which is near zero for the difference maps .",
    "the results of these tests are summarized in table  [ table : chi2 ] .",

    "( the second half of the flight ) .",
    "this test is sensitive to solar and ground pickup , since between the center of the 2dps data and the center of the 1dps data , the sun moves @xmath89 on the sky , and the gondola has moved half way around the continent between the time centroids of the two maps .",
    "the test is also sensitive to errors in the deconvolution of the transfer function of the time - domain signal , since the scan speed changes the spatio - temporal mapping of the signals .",
    "this test is performed on each of the five 150 ghz channels individually . without filtering out the isodec modes as described previously this test is failed . with the filtering , 4 of the 5 channels",
    "pass , and 1 of the 5 channels ( 150b1 ) shows a small but statistically significant signal .",
    "this channel is excluded from subsequent analysis .",
    "the isodec removal is applied to all of the channels included in the analysis .",
    "the 1st half - 2nd half difference test is also performed on maps with the four channels combined . at @xmath90",
    ", there is a statistically significant residual in the difference map at the level of @xmath91 .",
    "since the signal only appears in the combined channel 1dps - 2dps analysis , this is consistent with a noise term which changes slowly on the sky and is correlated between channels , such as atmosphere . at these angular scales ,",
    "the cmb signal is @xmath92 .",
    "since the residual signal is small compared to the cmb signal , its effects are neglected .",
    "a test for artifacts specific to particular detectors is made by differencing the map made from combining b150a and b150a1 with the combination of b150a2 and b150b2 , and a test for artifacts due to scan - synchronous baselines is made by differencing maps using only the left - going and right - going portions of the scans .",
    "there is no evidence of any residual signal in either of these tests , which is again consistent with a noise term that changes slowly on time scales comparable to the scan time .",
    "the comparison of the maps at the 4 different frequencies measured by boomerang is a powerful tool to test for contamination from foregrounds at 150 ghz . at the resolution frequencies probed by boomerang , thermal emission from interstellar dust grains",
    "is expected to be the most important foreground ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite probes the level of dust in the boomerang maps by correlating boomerang data with a dust template derived from the 3000 ghz iras / dirbe maps @xcite and extrapolating the dust dominated 410 ghz signal to 150 ghz using the measured correlations .",
    "the deduced power spectrum of dust fluctuations contributes less than @xmath93 to the power spectrum of sky temperature measured at 150 ghz . for this reason galactic dust contamination",
    "is neglected in the following .",
    "radio point sources are another potential form of contamination in the maps and angular power spectrum .",
    "the @xcite radio point source extrapolations are used to estimate the effects of known radio sources in the boomerang fields .",
    "the wombat extrapolated fluxes are converted to temperature using a gaussian beam that is a good approximation of the beam + pixel window function . assuming that each of the wombat sources is in a separate pixel , the @xmath94 contributed by these point sources to the map",
    "is calculated . in the @xmath60 power spectrum",
    "this should show up as a constant @xmath95 contribution , which is found by using the effective rms contributed by a random distribution of point sources , @xmath96 , and the known beam window function @xmath97 . for results quoted in the units of table  [ table : spec ] , this leads to an estimated point source contribution as a function of @xmath44 of @xmath98k@xmath99 .",
    "however , three quasars are easily identified in the maps and removed .",
    "the brightest two of these are also the two highest flux objects in the wombat catalog in our region ; the third quasar is the eighth brightest in the catalog . removing only the two brightest sources from the catalog and repeating",
    "the above analytic estimate leads to a prediction for the contribution of the remaining sources of only @xmath100k@xmath99 .",
    "the power spectrum is evaluated directly from the maps before and after removing the three quasars .",
    "this was done by ignoring pixels within @xmath101 of the quasar position .",
