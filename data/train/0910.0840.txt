    "do we have any other ` markers ' in the spectrum as definitive as the damped ly@xmath9  line to help us assess whether this background correction , whatever its origin , is constant along the spectrum or varies with wavelength . in the circumstances , we limited ourselves to applying to the final one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectrum a uniform background correction of 5% of the continuum flux .    at the s / n ratio of the present data , we could not find any significant differences between the extracted 1d spectra of the northern and southern arcs ; their similarity is consistent with the lensing model of dye et al .",

    "as we shall see below ( section  [ sec : intervening ] ) , the sightline to the cosmic eye intersects several lower redshift absorbers that produce a multitude of intervening absorption lines unrelated to the lensed galaxy at @xmath82 .",
    "these features do complicate the interpretation of the interstellar absorption due to the cosmic eye itself ; in figure  [ fig : ismvelocity3 ] we have indicated with downward pointing arrows instances where the absorption lines due to the interstellar medium in the cosmic eye are contaminated by intervening absorbers at lower redshifts .",

    "furthermore , it can be seen from figure  [ fig : ismvelocity3 ] that the redshifted component is absent in the absorption lines of the most highly ionized gas , civ and siiv , and is relatively weak in the intermediate ionization stage aliii . whenever possible , we have listed measurements of absorption redshift and equivalent width separately for the two components in table  [ table : is_lines ] .",
    "note , however , that the values of equivalent width given in the table may include blends with intervening absorption features , as explained above ; in this respect , the purely random errors quoted in columns ( 7 ) and ( 11 ) underestimate the true uncertainties ( random and systematic ) affecting these measurements .",
    "the kinematic pattern revealed by figure  [ fig : ismvelocity3 ] is unexpected for star - forming galaxies at all redshifts , where the interstellar medium seen in absorption against the starburst is primarily moving with _ negative _ velocities , commonly interpreted as large - scale outflows .",
    "for example , in the stack of more than 800 low resolution spectra of galaxies at @xmath90 constructed by shapley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the interstellar lines have a net blueshift of @xmath91 , and an analogous result is found in stacked spectra of galaxies at @xmath6 ( law et al .",
    "2007 ) , and @xmath92 , 5 and 6 ( vanzella et al . 2009 ) .",
    "similarly , in her esi study of the interstellar nai d lines in 18 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies , martin ( 2005 ) found signatures of outflows in 15 cases and of inflow in only one case . our earlier high - resolution work on other strongly lensed galaxies at @xmath93 ( pettini et al . 2002 ; quider et al .",
    "2009 ) did show a tail of absorption extending to positive velocities , but what we see in the cosmic eye is qualitatively different , with the redshifted component being of comparable strength to the blueshifted absorption . when observed at the low resolutions of most spectra of high-@xmath18 galaxies ( @xmath94 ) , the stronger interstellar lines in the cosmic eye would have a net redshift of @xmath95 km  s@xmath20 , which is highly unusual ( e.g. steidel et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we discuss possible interpretations in section  [ sec : discuss_kinematics ] .",
    "the profiles of the interstellar lines in the cosmic eye hold clues to the geometry of gas , dust , and stars in this galaxy .",
    "an inspection of figure  [ fig : ismvelocity3 ] reveals that the cores of the strongest lines which are not contaminated by intervening absorption at lower redshifts ( that is , lines not marked by a downward pointing arrow ) do not reach zero flux in either of the two kinematic components .",
    "we consider the implications of this residual intensity in the line cores for each component in turn .",
    "first we consider the redshifted component .",
    "siii@xmath96 , alii@xmath97 and feii@xmath98 all exhibit flat cores at a residual intensity of @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 is the measured intensity in the line at wavelength @xmath101 and @xmath102 is intensity in the continuum ) .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation is that we are seeing the superposition within the spectrum of saturated absorption lines and escaping continuum photons .",
    "such a scenario would apply if the absorbing material only covers @xmath103% of the continuum source .",
    "the analysis of the blueshifted component is less clear - cut .",
    "it appears to be covering even less of the stellar light than the redshifted component , with the saturated cores of siii@xmath96 and oi@xmath77 levelling at a residual intensity @xmath104 , corresponding to an apparent optical depth @xmath105 [ with the usual definition of the optical depth @xmath106 given by @xmath107 .",
    "alii@xmath97 and feii@xmath98 may not be fully saturated in this component , since their minimum residual intensities ( in the blue component ) are higher : @xmath108 , and @xmath109 respectively . on the other hand",
    ", we do not have a satisfactory explanation for the higher apparent optical depth of cii@xmath110 , unless this transition is blended with other unrecognized absorption ( in addition to the fine structure line cii@xmath111 which would fall @xmath112  to the red in the top left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : ismvelocity3 ] ) .    in any case , a lower covering factor of the blueshifted gas compared to the redshifted absorption",
    "is required in order to make sense of the apparent contradiction between the relative strengths of the red and blue components in absorption lines of differing @xmath66-values .",
    "for example , the two components are observed to have comparable values of @xmath113 in siii@xmath114 but different values in siii@xmath96 , with the blue component being weaker than the red one ( see lower two panels in the left - hand column of figure  [ fig : ismvelocity3 ] ) .",
    "such an arrangement would at first sight appear to be unphysical .",
    "these two siii transitions have widely different @xmath66-values ( see table  [ table : is_lines ] ) ; since they both arise from the same ground state of si@xmath115 , their _ intrinsic _ optical depths must be in the same ratio as their @xmath116 products , or @xmath117 .",
    "this expectation can only be reconciled with the measured values of _ apparent _ optical depth , @xmath113 , if we assume that the covering factor of the blue component is lower than that of the red one , and that both components are in fact saturated in siii@xmath96 .",
    "once that is taken into account , and the zero level adjusted accordingly , the intrinsic ( rather than apparent ) optical depth is actually higher in the blue component than in the red one .",
    "the combination of : ( a ) partial coverage by differing factors for the blue and red components , and possibly even varying as a function of velocity within each component ( see martin & bouch 2009 ) ; ( b ) contamination by unrelated absorption features due to lower redshift systems ; and ( c ) limited s / n ratio , makes it very difficult in our view to deduce reliable ion column densities from the analysis of the line profiles .",
    "accordingly , we have refrained from attempting to do so .",
    "the ly@xmath9  line in the cosmic eye shows a strong damped absorption profile , from which we deduce a neutral hydrogen column density @xmath118@xmath12 ( see figure  [ fig : dla ] ) .",
    "this is a high value of @xmath10(hi ) , near the upper end of the column density distribution of qso - dlas ( noterdaeme et al .",
    "2009 ) and more typical of the dlas seen in the spectra of the afterglows of high redshift gamma - ray bursts ( pontzen et al .",
    "the corresponding line width is @xmath119  or @xmath120  ( jenkins 1971 ) .",
    "on kinematic grounds it is therefore impossible , with the s / n ratio of the present data , to assign the dla absorption to one or other of the two main components visible in the metal absorption lines , which are separated by only @xmath121(section  [ sec : kinematics ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we suspect that most of the dla absorption may be due to the redshifted component , which has the larger covering fraction of the two and consists primarily of neutral gas .",
    "the @xmath122% covering factor we surmised for the outflowing , blueshifted , component may lead to the escape of a substantial fraction of the ly@xmath9  photons produced by the hii regions surrounding the ob stars , as found by quider et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in the case of the cosmic horseshoe . and",
    "yet no ly@xmath9  emission line is seen here , not even as residual emission when the damped profile is divided out , as is the case in cb58 ( pettini et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) and in the lensed @xmath123 lbg forj0332@xmath03557 observed by cabanac et al .",
    "it is possible that any ly@xmath9  photons that escape from the star - forming regions in the cosmic eye are absorbed by the foreground neutral gas giving rise to the redshifted component of the metal absorption lines .",
    "it is interesting that the damped ly@xmath9  line has a larger covering factor than any other absorption feature in the spectrum . recall that at the outset we subtracted off 5% of the continuum flux from the entire spectrum ( section  [ sec : observations ] ) , in order to bring the core of the damped ly@xmath9  line to zero . at this small level",
    ", we can not be sure whether this residual flux in the core of the line is due to inaccurate background estimation , or is the true level of unobscured continuum flux . in any case",
    ", the correction we have applied to our data translates to a lower limit of 95% to the covering factor of the ob star continuum by foreground hi gas .",
    "the fact that this is larger than the values we deduced in section  [ sec : partial_cover ] for the metal lines is not surprising , given that for solar abundances the optical depth in the ly@xmath9  line will exceed that of even the strongest metal lines from hi regions by factors of @xmath124 . in other words ,",
    "low column densities of gas , undetectable even in the strongest metal absorption lines , could be adding to the apparent optical depth in ly@xmath9  to give a higher overall covering fraction .",
    "bringing together the points discussed in this section , our high resolution esi observations have revealed that the interstellar spectrum of the cosmic eye is unusual in showing two absorption components , of approximately equal strengths , one blueshifted by @xmath5  and the other redshifted by @xmath7  relative to the systemic redshift @xmath80 defined by the ob stars and their hii regions .",
    "the redshifted component is mostly of low ionization .",

    "\\(i ) the interstellar absorption lines exhibit two components , of approximately equal strength , which are respectively blueshifted by @xmath5  and redshifted by @xmath7   relative to the stars and hii regions .",
    "while these values apply to the gas with the highest apparent optical depths , both components include absorption spanning several hundred .",
    "we associate the blueshifted component with a galaxy - wide outflow similar to , but possibly weaker than , those seen in most star - forming galaxies at @xmath63 .",
    "the redshifted absorption is very unusual , and may represent gas ejected by a previous episode of star formation and now falling back onto the galaxy , or a merger viewed along a favourable line of sight . alternatively , it may just be a chance superposition of another galaxy along the line of sight .",
    "\\(ii ) both components of the metal absorption lines show indications that they do not fully cover the ob stars against which they are being viewed ; we estimate covering fractions of @xmath122% and @xmath103% for the blueshifted and redshifted component respectively .",
    "there must also be more pervasive diffuse gas , because the strong damped ly@xmath9  line , corresponding to a column density @xmath10(hi)@xmath194@xmath12 , covers at least 95% of the uv stellar continuum .",
    "we tentatively associate this high column density of hi with the redshifted component of the metal lines , where absorption from ionized species is weak or missing altogether , and propose that it provides the ` foreground screen ' of dust responsible for the lower - than - expected far - infrared luminosity of the cosmic eye found by siana et al .",
    "( 2009 ) with the _ spitzer space telescope_.",
    "\\(iii ) the internal kinematics of the galaxy lensed into the cosmic eye are very complex , our data now adding outflow , and possibly even inflow , to the rotation and velocity dispersion already known from the integral field spectroscopy with adaptive optics by stark et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . ordered rotation , chaotic motions , and outflow all seem to be of comparable magnitude , with @xmath19570 .",
    "however , we do not have a model yet of how these different motions fit together into one coherent kinematic picture .",
    "\\(iv ) turning to the stellar spectrum , we find that the civ p  cygni profile is well fit by a _ starburst99 _ stellar population model spectrum having continous star formation with a salpeter imf , stellar masses from 5 to 100 , and a lmc / smc metallicity of @xmath127 .",
    "the p  cygni profiles of the cosmic eye , the cosmic horseshoe , and ms1512-cb58 , three high redshift star - forming galaxies studied at high spectral resolution , are all nearly identical .",
    "this is not unexpected , however , when we consider that in each case we see the integrated light of several hundred thousand o - type stars , and that these three galaxies have similar metallicities and dynamical timescales over which star formation is taking place .",
    "\\(v ) the metallicity @xmath190 deduced for the o stars in the cosmic eye is lower by a factor of @xmath187 than the value derived from the analysis of the strong nebular lines from its hii regions using the r23 index .",
    "we consider this apparent discrepancy to reflect systematic offsets between different abundance estimators , rather than intrinsic inhomogeneities in the chemical composition of stars and ionized gas .",
    "( vi ) the interpretation of both interstellar and stellar features in the uv spectrum of the cosmic eye is complicated by the presence of numerous intervening absorption lines associated with eight absorption systems at redshifts @xmath1443.0528 .",
    "these narrow features are not resolved in existing low - resolution data , highlighting the caution that should be exercised in interpreting the spectra that are typically available for unlensed lbgs .    in closing ,",
    "the new data presented here further emphasize the complexity of the physical conditions which prevailed in actively star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath63 .",
    "it is remarkable that the three strongly - lensed galaxies targeted by our esi observations , while showing very similar young stellar populations , are all different in the detailed properties of their interstellar media . whether such variety is simply the result of different geometries and viewing angles , or has its roots in more fundamental physical reasons remains to be established .",
    "fortunately , with the increasing attention being given to detailed studies of gravitationally lensed galaxies , we can look forward with optimism to a more comprehensive empirical picture of galaxy formation coming together in the years ahead .",
