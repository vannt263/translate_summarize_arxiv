    "the detection of high energy gamma rays from supernova remnants has long been considered as the most promising tool to test the supernova paradigm for the origin of the bulk of cosmic rays observed at the earth .",
    "several supernova remnants ( snrs ) have now been detected in gamma rays , while useful upper limits have been obtained for several others ( see @xcite and references therein for a recent review of observations and their implications ) .",
    "the question now to be answered is whether such emissions can be reliably considered as a proof of the acceleration of hadronic particles ( cosmic rays ) or if they should be rather interpreted as the result of radiative losses of relativistic electrons .",
    "this goal can be achieved by investigating the following aspects : 1 ) spectrum of the gamma ray emission combined with the spectrum of x - rays ( and possibly radio emission ) ; 2 ) high energy cutoff of the gamma ray emission ; 3 ) morphology of the emission .    here",
    "we specialize our calculations to the snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 .    for this remnant",
    ", the hess cherenkov gamma ray telescope has measured a spectrum extending to @xmath5 tev , although a power law spectrum with an exponential cutoff at @xmath6 leads to a best fit with @xmath7 tev @xcite .",
    "if this emission is due to decay of neutral pions produced by nuclear collisions of relativistic protons with some target gas in the shock vicinity , then this would imply a cutoff in the spectrum of accelerated protons at @xmath5 tev , roughly a factor of 30 short of the knee .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that in an expanding snr the highest cosmic ray energy is expected to be reached around the beginning of the sedov phase . before and after that time the maximum energy of accelerated particles does not need to be as high as the knee energy . moreover",
    ", different snrs might accelerate to different maximum energies because of the different environment in which they explode . in this sense",
    "it is only natural that most snrs do not show proton acceleration up to the energy of the knee .",
    "the strength and topology of the magnetic field in the acceleration / radiation region regulate the efficiency of particle acceleration ( nuclei and electrons ) and the radiation losses of electrons .",
    "the recent detection of narrow x - ray bright rims in several snrs @xcite has allowed to infer the strength of the field , if the thickness of the rims is interpreted as the synchrotron loss length of the radiating electrons @xcite .",
    "typical values of @xmath8 have been inferred , which suggest efficient magnetic field amplification in the shock region .",
    "one more argument in favor of strong magnetic fields was made by @xcite who interpreted the rapid time variability ( of the orders of few years ) observed in some x - ray emitting regions of rx j1713.7 - 3946 as due to rapid synchrotron cooling .",
    "the field strength inferred based on this interpretation is as high as @xmath9 mg .",
    "the same effect was also observed in some knots of cas a @xcite .",
    "there is however a large source of ambiguity in that the narrow thickness of the x - ray rims might be due to damping of the magnetic field ( for instance due to wave - wave non - linear coupling ) @xcite . in this case",
    "the magnetic field inferred by assuming that the rims are due to severe synchrotron losses might be overestimated .",
    "we discuss this issue at several points throughout the paper .",
    "magnetic field amplification could result from turbulent amplification @xcite or from cosmic ray induced streaming instability .",
    "an open question is whether the large magnetic fields present in the x - ray rims are widespread throughout the remnant or are rather confined in thin filaments with a relatively small filling factor ( this would be the case if damping plays a role downstream of the shock ) . this difference might have important consequences on the interpretation of the observed non - thermal emission from snrs , as we discuss below .",
    "interestingly enough , the magnetic field strength inferred from x - ray observations is of the same order of magnitude as that required by the theory of shock acceleration in order to account for particle acceleration up to the knee region , provided the diffusion coefficient is bohm - like .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", a major improvement has been achieved in the last few years in that the calculations are carried out in the context of the so - called non - linear theory of particle acceleration .",
    "this theory allows us to calculate the spectrum and spatial distribution of accelerated particles around the shock , their dynamical reaction on the shock and the magnetic field amplification that cosmic rays induce due to streaming instability .",
    "although the non - linear theory has been previously applied to snrs , this paper improves on previous attempts in two major aspects : 1 ) the magnetic field in the shock region is calculated from streaming instability and from conservation equations instead of being inserted _ ad hoc _ in such a way to fit the x - ray observations ; 2 ) we include the dynamical reaction of the turbulent magnetic field on the shock , which is a very important effect in shaping the shock precursor ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first point is of crucial importance in that it allows us to achieve a unified picture of the spectra of x - ray and gamma ray emission , together with the morphology of the x - ray emission , the strength of the magnetic field and finally the diffusion properties of the accelerated particles .",
    "inclusion of the dynamical reaction of the field , then , as showed by @xcite , leads to a substantial reduction of the compression in the precursor , thereby also reducing the concavity of the spectrum of accelerated particles ( @xcite ) .",
    "a reduced concavity of the spectrum should also be expected as a result of the enhanced velocity of the scattering centers when the magnetic field is amplified ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the large values of the magnetic field strength inferred from x - ray observations and confirmed by our calculations clearly favor a hadronic interpretation of the observed gamma ray emission , because a subdominant population of electrons is sufficient to explain the spectrum and intensity of the observed x - ray emission , but is insufficient to produce the observed gamma ray emission through inverse compton scattering ( ics ) on the cmb and infrared / optical photons ( ir+opt )",
    ". the issue of whether the large fields are present in large fractions of the remnant volume or are rather confined in narrow filaments , remains however an open issue .",
    "for this reason we also investigate the possibility that the filaments have some alternative explanation , so that there is no constraint on the strength of the magnetic field downstream .",
    "we still use our non - linear calculations to derive the spectra of accelerated protons and electrons , but force the injection to be low enough to avoid large magnetic fields produced by streaming instability .",
    "we find that a marginal fit to the gamma ray and x - ray data is possible , although a large density of ir photons needs to be assumed inside the remnant .",
    "the fit to the highest energy part of the gamma ray spectrum is not as good as for the hadronic interpretation .",
    "the general conclusion we draw is that although there are numerous indications that the observed gamma rays may be of hadronic origin , a clear answer on this point may only come from : a ) the extension of the gamma ray observations to lower energies , and b ) the detection of high energy neutrinos , which would be produced in the same hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : model ] we discuss in some detail the general lines of the calculations we carry out , including the non - linear theory of particle acceleration , the magnetic field amplification and the different channels of non - thermal emissions . in  [ sec : results ] we discuss the results we obtain by specializing the calculations to the case of the snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the technical aspects of the calculations we carry out , with special attention for the computation of the spectra of protons and electrons , the magnetic field amplification and the radiation processes that we include .",
    "the dynamics of the shock region is dominated by accelerated protons , while electrons are accelerated in the shock environment generated by protons . in this sense",
    "the non - linearity of the problem is limited to the proton component , which also generates the local magnetic field by exciting a streaming instability .",
    "the spectrum of accelerated protons is computed using the method of @xcite .",
    "the acceleration time in the presence of a precursor was determined by @xcite , and we adopt that calculation .",
    "it was found there ( and later confirmed for the parameters of rx j1713.7 - 3946 by @xcite ) that the precursor reduces the maximum energy compared with the naive prediction of the test - particle theory with the same value of the magnetic field upstream of the subshock .",
    "the maximum momentum is first calculated using as a condition the equality between the acceleration time and the age of the snr .",
    "however we also illustrate our results in the case in which the maximum momentum is determined by the finite size of the accelerator .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is chosen to be bohm - like in the magnetic field generated through streaming instability ( see   [ sec : dyn ] ) .",
    "since the magnetic field depends on the location in the precursor , the diffusion coefficient is also a function of space : @xmath10 .",
    "the two conditions mentioned above read : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fraction of the shell radius ( @xmath13 ) where the escape of particles at @xmath14 occurs .",
    "although the basic structure of the calculation is the same proposed by @xcite and @xcite , the crucial new aspect taken into account here is the dynamical reaction of the self - generated magnetic field .",
    "we introduce this effect following the treatment of @xcite and @xcite : the conservation equations at the shock and in the precursor are modified so as to include the magnetic contribution .",
    "the compression factor at the subshock , @xmath15 , and the total compression factor , @xmath16 , are deeply affected by this change , in that the ratio @xmath17 ( the compression factor in the precursor ) , decreases when the amplified magnetic field contributes a pressure which is comparable with the pressure of the thermal gas upstream . in turn",
    "this reflects in spectra of accelerated particles which are closer to power laws , though a concavity remains visible @xcite , as we discuss below .",
    "the normalization of the proton spectrum is an output of our non linear calculation , once a recipe for injection has been established .",
    "following @xcite , particles are injected immediately downstream of the subshock .",
    "the fraction of gas particles crossing the shock from downstream to upstream , @xmath18 , can be written as @xmath19 here @xmath20 is defined by the relation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the momentum of the thermal particles downstream .",
    "@xmath23 parametrizes the poorly known microphysics of the injection process , but one should stress that @xmath22 is an output of the problem : as a result , the injection efficiency is affected by the dynamical reaction exerted by the accelerated particles and by the amplified magnetic field .",
    "the spectrum of accelerated electrons at the shock , @xmath24 , is easy to calculate for @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the maximum electron momentum .",
    "in fact the slope of the electron spectrum at given momentum @xmath27 is the same as the slope of the proton spectrum at the same momentum , assuming that both electrons and protons experience the same diffusion coefficient .",
    "the relative normalization of the two spectra is unconstrained _ a priori _ , while the normalization of the proton spectrum , as stressed above , is an output of our non linear calculation .",
    "the maximum energy of electrons is determined by equating the acceleration time with the minimum between the time for energy losses and the age of the remnant .",
    "the loss time of electrons over a cycle of shock crossing needs to be weighed by the residence times upstream and downstream , therefore the condition for the maximum momentum , in the loss dominated case , can be written as : @xmath28 \\left [    \\frac{t_{r,1}(p)}{\\tau_{l,1}(b_1,p)}+\\frac{t_{r,2}(p)}{\\tau_{l,2}(b_2,p ) } \\right ] , \\label{eq : pemax}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the loss time , and the indexes `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' refer to quantities measured upstream and downstream respectively .",
    "the residence times in the context of non linear theory of particle acceleration can be written explicitely ( from eqs .",
    "( 25 ) and ( 26 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "( [ eq : pemax ] ) can not be solved for @xmath26 analytically , contrary to the case of acceleration in the test particle regime .",
    "the numerical solution is however easy to obtain with standard techniques .",
    "when only synchroton losses are important , we can provide an approximate expression for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pemax ] ) .",
    "we use the function @xmath30 defined as the mean plasma velocity that a particle with momentum @xmath27 experiences in the precursor region ( see eq .",
    "( 8) in @xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath31 is such that @xmath32 for any momentum . the electron maximum momentum",
    "can then be written in an implicit way as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the classical electron radius .",
    "one may notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : pmax_e_2 ] ) reduces to the eq .  ( 11 ) of @xcite if one poses @xmath35 .",
    "( [ eq : pmax_e_2 ] ) leads to an error of less than @xmath36 with respect to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pemax ] ) ( but we stress that the results presented in this work are all obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq : pemax ] ) ) .",
    "the spectrum of electrons at energies around and above @xmath26 , namely the shape of the cutoff is harder to calculate in the context of a fully non linear calculation . in the test particle case and for strong shocks",
    "the solution has been calculated by @xcite . since the spectra we find for electrons at @xmath37 are",
    "not far from being power laws with slope @xmath38 , we adopt the modification factor calculated by @xcite and we write the electron spectrum at the shock in the loss dominated case as : @xmath39}^2    e^{-p^2/p_{e,\\rm max}^2 } \\,.\\ ] ] the most important aspect of this expression is the fact that the cutoff is not a simple exponential , which in turn reflects in the shape of the secondary emission radiated by electrons .",
    "this important conclusion differs from the numerous calculations previously carried out by other authors , where an exponential cutoff was assumed for the electron spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "if the maximum momentum is indeed determined by the age of the remnant , then the cutoff shape is expected to be exponential .",
    "the constant @xmath40 accounts for the different normalization between the electron and proton spectrum .",
    "the turbulent magnetic field close to the shock can be enhanced by several physical processes . here",
    "we concentrate on the amplification due to streaming instability induced by cosmic rays accelerated at the shock and we show that this mechanism allows us to reproduce the strength of the magnetic fields which are inferred by assuming that the thickness of the x - ray filaments is due to severe synchrotron energy losses . on the other hand , if the filaments are interpreted in a different way , very low efficiencies of proton acceleration are required in order to avoid effective magnetic field amplification .",
    "the streaming of cosmic rays upstream of a shock excites both resonant ( @xcite ) and non - resonant @xcite modes .",
    "the latter modes are expected to dominate for fast shocks , efficiently accelerating cosmic rays , most likely during the free expansion phase of the post - supernova evolution and at the very beginning of the sedov phase @xcite . at any later time",
    ", resonantly excited alfvn waves should account for most of the field amplification in the shock vicinity .",
    "although the predictions of quasi - linear theory should be taken with caution when considering the regime of strongly non - linear field amplification , @xmath41 , at present no better treatment is possible .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field at the position @xmath42 upstream , @xmath43 , in the absence of damping , can be estimated from the saturation condition , that , for modified shocks , reads ( @xcite ) : @xmath44 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the magnetic pressure normalized to the incoming momentum flux at upstream infinity . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b_amp ] ) , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the alfvnic mach number at upstream infinity where only the background magnetic field , @xmath48 , assumed to be parallel to the shock normal , is present .",
    "@xmath49 accounts for the magnetic pressure due to a pre - existing magnetic turbulence .",
    "this term is usually set to zero in the following calculations , unless otherwise specified .",
    "( [ eq : b_amp ] ) correctly describes into account the effect of compression in the shock precursor through the term @xmath50 . for the upstream temperature that we adopt in rx j1713.7 - 3946 ( see below ) , damping in the upstream region is expected to be negligible .",
    "this expression has been derived for alfvn waves , therefore the perturbation is perpendicular to @xmath48 , namely in the plane of the shock .",
    "the magnetic field downstream of the subshock is further enhanced by compression : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the magnetic field immediately upstream of the subshock .",
    "the combined action of cosmic ray induced magnetic field amplification and field compression at the subshock results in a situation in which the magnetic pressure may easily exceed the pressure of the background plasma . as shown by @xcite",
    ", this leads to a reduction of the compressibility of the plasma , so that the value of @xmath16 drops compared with the cases in which this dynamical reaction of the magnetic field is ignored . as stressed by @xcite this effect alleviates the need for invoking poorly known processes such as the so - called turbulent heating .      in this section",
    "we briefly describe the calculations of the fluxes of nonthermal radiation produced by electrons and protons in the snr .",
    "we concentrate on the following channels : 1 ) gamma ray production by generation and decay of neutral pions in inelastic @xmath53 collisions ; 2 ) synchrotron emission of electrons ; 3 ) ics of electrons on the cmb and infrared / optical photons in the remnant .",
    "the flux and spectrum of gamma rays from @xmath54 decay are calculated following the analytical approximations discussed by @xcite .",
    "the cutoff in the gamma ray spectrum resulting from @xmath54 decay can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the maximum energy of accelerated protons .",
    "qualitatively , the spectrum of gamma rays at energy @xmath57 reproduces the shape of the parent proton spectrum .",
    "the gamma ray spectrum is therefore expected to show some level of concavity , typical of acceleration at cosmic ray modified shocks . at",
    "energies lower than the pion mass , the gamma ray spectrum is found to rapidly drop .",
    "synchrotron emission is produced by accelerated electrons in the magnetic field amplified by streaming cosmic ray protons .",
    "the calculation of the synchrotron emission is carried out by using the exact synchrotron kernel @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron spectrum is cut off at a photon energy @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the local magnetic field in units of @xmath60 .",
    "it is easy to check that for @xmath61 tev , the synchrotron emission is cut off in the kev energy range .",
    "it is also worth keeping in mind that in the straightforward case of bohm diffusion at a linear shock , the maximum energy of electrons scales as @xmath62 , therefore @xmath63 is independent of the magnetic field . in our calculations ,",
    "the non - linear effects induce a weak dependence on magnetic field , as discussed in   [ sec : results ] .    in this paper",
    "we compute the synchrotron radiation spectrum limited to x - ray band .",
    "the radio emission , being produced by lower energy electrons , with much longer lifetimes , is affected by the temporal evolution of the supernova remnant , which strongly depends on the environment in which the blast wave propagates .",
    "the x - ray emission is confined to a narrow region behind the shock , whose thickness is determined , depending on the radiating electron energy , by either the diffusion or advection length covered by electrons during their loss time . as we show at the end of next section the contribution to the x - ray radiation from the upstream region is negligible , due to the much lower magnetic field ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f5 ] and the corresponding discussion ) .",
    "the thickness of the radiating rim can be estimated by solving the diffusion - convection equation in the downstream plasma : @xmath64 , where @xmath65 has been assumed to be spatially constant ( i.e. we are neglecting any magnetic damping mechanisms ) .",
    "the solution has the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the spatial scale of the emitting region for electrons with momentum @xmath27 and is given by @xcite : @xmath68 the observed thickness of the rim is obtained by correcting the previous expression for projection effects . in the ideal case of a spherical shock , an exponential profile translates into a projected thickness @xmath69 @xcite , where @xmath70 is defined as the size of the region over which the observed brightness drops to half of the maximum .",
    "finally , electrons contribute to gamma ray emission through their ics of ambient photons .",
    "the main contribution to gamma ray emission comes from upscattered dust - processed infrared photons , having a blackbody spectrum with temperature @xmath71 k @xcite .",
    "following the instance of the ir+opt photon background in the interstellar medium ( ism ) we assume that the ratio of the optical to infrared energy densities remains @xmath71 , while the energy density of ir light , @xmath72 , is left as a free parameter ( in the ism , @xmath73 ) .",
    "the flux and spectrum of ics photons is calculated by using the exact kernel for ics , with the full klein - nishina ( kn ) cross section @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is cut off at an energy @xmath74 if @xmath75 gev and @xmath76 otherwise .",
    "the boundary between the two regimes corresponds to the setting in of the kn regime . for the photon background we adopted here ( @xmath77 ev ) ,",
    "the threshold is at energy @xmath78 tev , therefore for the case of rx j1713.7 - 3946 , the cutoff region falls well within the thompson regime and eq .",
    "( [ eq : cutics ] ) applies .",
    "in this section we describe the results of our calculations for the case of snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "a major difficulty in carrying out detailed calculations on this remnant is that neither its distance nor its age are well established .",
    "@xcite infer a distance of @xmath79 kpc , based on asca x - ray observations , while @xcite estimate a distance of @xmath80 kpc . here",
    "we adopt the value of 1 kpc , which appears to be supported by some more recent work @xcite based on the spatial correlation between the remnant and a molecular cloud located at that distance .",
    "this estimate was also independently confirmed by @xcite based on the comparison between the interstellar absorption as measured using x - ray and radio observations .",
    "since the observed angular size of the remnant is @xmath81 , the remnant radius can be estimated to be @xmath82 pc , which would lead to estimate an age of @xmath83 yr , consistent with the historical chinese record of a sn exploded in ad 393 @xcite .",
    "several authors , based on different arguments , have reached the conclusion that rx j1713.7 - 3946 is a core collapse sn of type ii / ib , expanding into a hot and very diluted bubble created by the wind of a massive progenitor star with initial mass between @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "these authors also conclude that the bubble must have a radius of @xmath85 pc , hence the shock front of the remnant is most likely still propagating into the low density shocked wind , except perhaps for the sw region where the shock seems to impact the cold and dense shell of unshocked material .",
    "this scenario leads to a temperature for the bubble typically @xmath86 k @xcite .",
    "in order to account for the inhomogeneity of the medium , we adopt here a somewhat lower value of @xmath87 k. we checked however that our results are very weakly dependent on the value of the gas temperature at upstream infinity , as long as it is larger than @xmath88 k.    other uncertainties that affect the results of our calculations concern the density of the background medium , @xmath89 , and the strength of the background magnetic field ( before amplification takes place ) . here",
    "we adopt @xmath90 , which is somewhat dictated by the fitting to the hess data .",
    "somewhat larger values of @xmath89 could be still compatible with hess observations if a fudge factor is introduced to account for the fact that the gamma ray emission is not homogeneous over the sn shell .",
    "several attempts at measuring the ambient gas density have been made .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath91 comes from the molecular hydrogen column density in parts of the snr without detectable co emission that can be derived based on nanten @xcite measurements ( see also @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "the other existing constraint was inferred by @xcite based on the lack of thermal x - ray emission in xmm data .",
    "the limit reads @xmath92 .",
    "however , it is worth keeping in mind that this limit was derived by assuming that electrons and protons are in thermal equilibrium downstream , but the same authors suggest that this is likely not the case .",
    "they also investigate the non - equilibrium case but apparently they used an equal temperature of electrons and protons in this second case as well .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath93 km / s to the velocity of the ejecta was inferred by @xcite based on a direct measurement of the transient x - ray emitting region . on the other hand a value @xmath94 km / s would not allow for acceleration of electrons up to high enough energy to explain the observed x - ray emission .",
    "here we adopt a value of @xmath95 km / s necessary to fit the cutoff in the x - ray spectrum as detected by suzaku .",
    "a lower value of about@xmath96 km / s would be needed to fit the asca data , but we do not discuss this case any further here , given the superior quality of the suzaku data .    .",
    "also shown on the upper @xmath42-axis of both panels is the corresponding value of the background magnetic field @xmath48 that was used for the calculation . notice that while the @xmath65-scale is logarithmic , the @xmath48-scale is arbitrary and built to show the correspondence between @xmath48 and @xmath65 .",
    "the _ upper panel _ shows the case where @xmath48 is resonantly amplified by the streaming instability . here",
    "the thick vertical lines indicate the solutions having the x - ray rim thickness equal to @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 of the snr radius respectively . in the _ lower panel _",
    "we assume no magnetic field amplification , but simple compression of @xmath48 in the precursor and at the shock .",
    "the results in both panels are obtained with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and with the maximum proton momentum determined by the condition @xmath102 yr . ]",
    "the model parameters are further constrained by the fact that the magnetic field in the downstream plasma , @xmath65 , is an output of our calculations , for given @xmath48 , as it is the result of cosmic ray induced magnetic field amplification and further enhancement by compression in the precursor and at the subshock .",
    "the correct solution of the problem is found by not only requiring that the fluxes of observed radiations are fit , but also requiring that @xmath65 corresponds to the value inferred from the measured thickness of the x - ray rim . for snr rx j1713.7 - 3946",
    ", we use the data presented in @xcite where the authors use a chandra observation at 5 kev to infer the rim thickness in the northwestern region of the snr .",
    "the procedure leads to @xmath103 ( see their fig .",
    "clearly this thickness does not lead to an estimate of @xmath65 if due to damping of the magnetic field ( as proposed by @xcite ) rather than to particles energy losses .",
    "below , we first assume that the downstream magnetic field can indeed be derived from the extent of the x - ray filaments and then we investigate the consequences of relaxing this constraint .    a first indication of the origin of the observed radiations can be obtained by looking at the cutoff frequencies in the different bands . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] we show the cutoff energies for synchrotron emission ( dotted line , in units of kev ) , @xmath54 decay ( solid line , in tev ) and ics ( dash - dotted line for ics on the infrared light and dashed line for ics on the cmb ) as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cutgamma ] ) , ( [ eq : cutsyn ] ) and ( [ eq : cutics ] ) .",
    "the plot is obtained for fixed @xmath100 and varying @xmath48 between @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( upper @xmath42-axis ) , while the lower @xmath42-axis shows the corresponding value of @xmath65 .",
    "the vertical thick solid line shows the solution that provides the central value of the measured rim thickness ( corresponding to @xmath106 g ) while the dashed vertical lines bound the allowed region corresponding to @xmath107 .    for the range of values of @xmath48 considered here , it is apparent that ics can not provide a high enough cutoff energy so as to explain hess data .",
    "the latter require @xmath108 tev , while the highest value of the ics cutoff energy obtained for scattering on the ir light in the presence of an extremely low background magnetic field ( @xmath109 ) is @xmath38 tev .",
    "the corresponding cutoff energies for ics off the cmb photons are lower by roughly the ratio of temperatures : @xmath110 .",
    "the general trend of the ics cutoff energy is to decrease as a function of @xmath48 ( and @xmath65 ) because larger values of the magnetic field lead to stronger synchrotron losses and thereby lower maximum energies of the electrons .",
    "there are however two subtleties .",
    "first , taking into account nonlinear effects in the computation of the acceleration time reduces somewhat the dependence of @xmath111 on the magnetic field , with respect to the expectations of the linear shock analysis .",
    "moreover , for values of @xmath65 lower than @xmath112 g , the maximum electron energy is determined by the finite age of the remnant rather than by synchrotron losses .",
    "hence , for values of the magnetic field below this threshold , the maximum electron energy increases with increasing magnetic field ( because of the more effective diffusion ) and reaches a maximum for @xmath113 g .",
    "this corresponds to the highest possible value of @xmath111 .",
    "it is important to stress that the conclusion that the cutoff frequency for ics falls short of explaining hess data by about one order of magnitude is independent of arguments related to the normalization of the flux , which we comment upon below .",
    "the cutoff energy for gamma rays produced by @xmath54 decay is @xmath114 tev provided @xmath115 g , which interestingly enough is also the region where @xmath65 is consistent with the thickness of the x - ray rims , if these are interpreted as the result of severe synchrotron losses downstream .",
    "the cutoff energy of synchrotron emitted photons , which , assuming bohm diffusion , in linear theory would not depend on the value of the magnetic field , now acquires a weak dependence on @xmath48 , and varies between @xmath116 1 and 2 kev for the considered range of magnetic field values , granted that @xmath117 g .",
    "things change drastically when @xmath65 is lower than this threshold and the maximum electron energy is determined by the competition between acceleration time and age of the system , rather than synchrotron losses ( lower panel of fig .",

    "we specialized our calculations to the snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "previous attempts to carry out similar calculations did not include the magnetic field amplification ( which was input _ by hand _ so as to fit the data ) and its dynamical reaction .",

    "this serves as a model for a leptonic origin of the hess data on rx j1713.7 - 3946 .",
    "the main discrimination between the two scenarios resides in the strength of the magnetic field at the shock : efficient cosmic ray acceleration also leads to the generation of magnetic field upstream of the shock which by compression translates into a downstream field of @xmath177 , compatible with the value which has been inferred from the interpretation of the morphology of the x - ray emission as due to synchrotron losses .",
    "the second scenario requires that the magnetic field is very weakly amplified ( if at all ) , so that @xmath178 . in this case",
    "the x - ray morphology is interpreted as a result of damping of the magnetic field in the downstream plasma @xcite .    in the following we discuss these two scenarios in terms of their problems and virtues , which also leads us to comment on the origin of the x - ray filaments .",
    "our calculations show that for the parameters typically adopted for rx j1713.7 - 3946 , and assuming @xmath100 for the injection , particle acceleration of protons works efficiently .",
    "x - ray and gamma ray data can be fit very well within this approach , and the strength of the downstream magnetic field turns out to describe well the brightness profile of the x - ray emission without further adjustments .",
    "the cutoff in the gamma ray emission leads to conclude that a cutoff in the parent proton spectrum is at @xmath179 gev .",
    "we stress that this is the cutoff in the proton spectrum which is being accelerated at the present time , while the highest energy which can be achieved in a snr is reached at the very beginning of the sedov phase . during the sedov phase , particles which reached higher energies at previous times escape the system from upstream ( and indeed these are the only particles which are allowed to leave the system from upstream ) .",
    "the shape of the x - ray spectrum is taken from the recent suzaku observations of rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , which lead to a cutoff energy in the x - ray spectrum requiring a shock velocity of @xmath180 km / s within the framework of our model . for bohm diffusion",
    "the energy of the x - ray cutoff is very weakly dependent on the magnetic field strength in the shock region ( in fact in linear theory it would have been independent of @xmath181 ) . in this scenario",
    "the ics contribution from high energy accelerated electrons is negligible compared with the contribution of @xmath54 decays , unless an unreasonably large energy density of target ir light is adopted .",
    "the best fit is achieved by using a density of the upstream gas of @xmath182 .",
    "the implications of this result are far reaching and deserve some discussion : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] the emission expected from the gas behind the shock as a result of thermal bremsstrahlung emission of electrons exceeds the observed flux by a factor @xmath80 .",
    "this conclusion could be also derived based on simpler calculations , as done by @xcite . however , as also argued by @xcite , the electrons and protons in this snr are not expected to be in thermal equilibrium because of the relatively low density of the medium .",
    "this possibility is also discussed by @xcite , who find that for a remnant with velocity @xmath183 km / s the ratio of the electron to proton temperature is @xmath184 and scales as @xmath185 ( recall however that these conclusions were obtained in the context of linear calculations , and could be even stronger if the non - linear effects are taken into account ) .",
    "we showed that such a temperature ratio would lead to predict a thermal x - ray emission well below the sensitivity of suzaku and asca . on the other hand , although the age of this remnant is too short to allow coulomb scattering to equilibrate electrons and protons downstream , one should check that coulomb scattering acting for @xmath83 years does not heat electrons enough ( about 1 kev ) to excite lines in iron atoms , which would then become easily visible on top of the synchrotron emission ( see for instance @xcite for a discussion of this effect ) .",
    "@xcite also criticized the hadronic scenario based on the lack of an excess gamma ray emission in the direction in which , according to @xcite the shock appears to have impacted a nearby molecular cloud , where the target density for @xmath53 collisions should be higher . as simple as this inference may sound ,",
    "it is not that straightforward : the gas in the molecular cloud is expected to be mostly neutral , a fact that has at least two important consequences .",
    "first , only the ionized component takes part in the acceleration process ( recall that in order to be scattered back towards the shock from downstream , incoming particles should be ionized within a few times the shock thickness ) .",
    "this implies that the efficiency of particle acceleration in the proximity of the molecular cloud could be much lower than in less dense parts of the surrounding medium .",
    "moreover , in a mostly neutral medium , the alfvnic turbulence on which efficient particle acceleration relies can be effectively damped , thereby leading to a lower maximum energy of accelerated particles .",
    "these two instances show that having a dense target for @xmath53 collisions does not necessarily imply that there should be a larger gamma ray flux from @xmath54 decay .",
    "as already stressed , the actual trademark of the hadronic scenario discussed above is the prediction that the downstream magnetic field in rx j1713.7 - 3946 is @xmath186 , which would imply that the filaments observed in x - rays are due to severe synchrotron losses of accelerated electrons .",
    "@xcite argued that a narrow region of x - ray emission could also be due to damping of the magnetic field downstream of the shock .",
    "the argument was also adopted by @xcite in order to suggest that hess gamma rays must be of leptonic origin .",
    "@xcite also quote the results of @xcite on sn1006 to stress that filamentary structures are observed also in the radio and not only in x - rays , therefore the filaments can not be due to synchrotron losses .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that @xcite use their data to reach the opposite conclusion .",
    "in fact @xcite plot the spatial profiles of the radio and x - ray emission , which show that the radio emission profile has only a shallow bump , when compared with the pronounced peak in the x - ray brightness .",
    "we should recall that the thickness of the damping region , as correctly proposed by @xcite , is determined by using the convection equation for the waves , with no generation terms and only a damping term .",
    "this trivially leads to a solution which is an exponential in the spatial coordinate with a cutoff scale which defines the damping scale .",
    "it is worth reminding that the exponential shape is the very reason why one should expect a filament . in order to avoid that an equally pronounced filamentary structure appears in radio ,",
    "@xcite are forced to assume that the field has a residual large scale component which is not affected by the damping : the radio emission then comes from lower energy electrons propagating in this residual field .",
    "this solution appears to us rather fine tuned , a limitation that should be kept in mind when discussing the damping explanation of the x - ray morphology .",
    "this limitation is probably even more serious in the case of rx j1713.7 - 3946 , where the x - ray emitting region is comparatively broader and it is not very easy to explain it with the damping models proposed by @xcite ( see eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 12 ) of their paper ) , although there are many parameters in their formulae that can be appropriately tuned .    in our opinion ,",
    "a rather serious concern about a hadronic origin of the hess gamma ray emission , and indeed about this remnant being an efficient cosmic ray accelerator , is the low value of @xmath40 predicted by the non - linear theory .",
    "our calculations lead to @xmath187 , which is much lower than the value inferred from direct measurement of the electron spectrum in the @xmath188 gev energy region , at the earth . at first sight",
    "one should conclude that if the gamma radiation detected by hess is of hadronic origin , then electrons should have a different origin , but a dedicated investigation of the problem should be planned to address this issue , since the very problem of electron escape from the remnant needs to be carefully addressed .",
    "one obvious warning against easy conclusions in this respect is that the value of @xmath40 measured at the earth is not the same as inferred for a single snr at a given age .",
    "it is rather an average over the temporal evolution of a remnant and a sum over the many snrs that contribute a flux at any given time .",
    "in fact @xmath40 is in general a function of time for a snr , and it is possible that low energy electrons are more effectively produced at later times when proton acceleration and magnetic field amplification become less efficient , and probably there is no appreciable gamma ray emission due to pp scattering .",
    "now we discuss our attempt to fit the hess data with a leptonic model .",
    "we stress that the calculations carried out here are exactly the same as described above , with the only difference that we assume a larger value for the injection parameter @xmath23 , chosen here to be @xmath166 ( corresponding to a fraction of accelerated particles @xmath3 ) .",
    "the generation of magnetic field by streaming instability is also kept in the calculations , although the predicted field strength is clearly much lower than in the previous case .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] , a fit to the combined hess and suzaku data is possible if the highest energy hess data points are ignored .",
    "the cosmic ray acceleration efficiency corresponding to this solution is @xmath189 .",
    "the magnetic field found as a result of streaming instability and further compression in the precursor and at the subshock is @xmath4 and the cutoff energy of the electrons is still determined by energy losses .",
    "this is an important point , because the cutoff in the electron spectrum is super - exponential ( namely @xmath190 $ ] ) only if the rate of losses is @xmath191 .",
    "if the maximum energy of electrons is determined by the finite age of the accelerator , then an exponential cutoff should be expected .",

    "we consider this as a problematic aspect of the leptonic model , since this population of photons should be introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ , without a proper independent physical motivation .",

    "future observations of this remnant in the multi - tev range will tell us if this might be the case .",

    "<S> current hess gamma ray observations combined with recent x - ray observations by suzaku do not allow as yet to draw a definitive conclusion on whether rx j1713.7 - 3946 is an efficient cosmic ray accelerator , although at the present time a hadronic interpretation of hess data seems more likely . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of our results for the glast gamma ray telescope , which should be able to discriminate the two scenarios discussed above , by observing the shape of the gamma ray spectrum at lower energies .    </S>",
