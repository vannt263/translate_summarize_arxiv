    "there are a number of observational candidates for triggering of star formation by cloud collisions .",

    "it can be difficult to rule out chance alignments of multiple , independent velocity components that are seen in projection .",
    "it is also very challenging to discern the overall 3d distribution of cloud structures from position - position - velocity data .",
    "the basic question we seek to answer is whether realistic models for gmc - gmc collisions , i.e. , converging flows of molecular gas that are already prone to gravitational instability , result in dense gas structures and star formation activity that can explain typical observed star - forming regions . in our first paper in this series , (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we presented idealized 2d simulations of gmc collisions and their effect on a pre - existing dense , magnetized clump .",

    "these allow prediction of molecular line diagnostics of cloud collisions : e.g. , collisions lead to high ratios of @xmath2co(@xmath1=8 - 7 ) to lower @xmath1 line intensities . here in paper ii , we will extend these models to 3d , turbulent gmcs and focus on the properties of dense gas created in gmc - gmc collisions .",
    "paper iii will explicitly model the star formation that may result from such collisions .",
    "our work is part of a growing body of numerical studies that have investigated cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "early simulations typically initialized two spherical clouds and studied the physical effects of collisions .",
    "it was shown that collisions produce bow shocks which lead to compression of gas and gravitational instability @xcite , bending mode instabilities and highly inhomogeneous high - density regions @xcite , thin - shell and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities due to shear @xcite , and filament formation from a shock- compressed layer @xcite .",
    "recent simulations of turbulent , unmagnetized clouds showed core formation at the collision interface with properties favorable to massive star creation @xcite , and with observational signatures potentially found in position - velocity diagrams @xcite .",
    "our work is distinguished from the above studies by modeling magnetized , turbulent clouds , with realistic heating and cooling functions .",
    "these enable us to focus on a number of diagnostic signatures of cloud collisions that can be compared against observed clouds .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] describes our numerical methods and initial setup .",
    "section [ sec : results ] discusses our results , which include morphologies (  [ sec : results - morphology ] ) , magnetic fields , (  [ sec : results - bfield ] ) , probability distribution functions (  [ sec : results - pdf ] ) , integrated intensity maps (  [ sec : results - intensity ] ) , kinematics (  [ sec : results - kinematics ] ) , and dynamics (  [ sec : results - dynamics ] ) .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we choose initial conditions to match properties of observed gmcs .",
    "we include physical processes likely to be dominant in the formation and evolution of structure within gmcs : self - gravity , supersonic turbulence , and magnetic fields .",
    "we then focus on the effects of colliding two clouds that are converging at a given velocity and with a given initial impact parameter .",
    "our simulation volume is a @xmath24-sided cube containing two identical , initially spherical gmcs with uniform densities of h nuclei of @xmath25 and radii @xmath26  pc , giving each gmc a mass @xmath27 .",
    "the clouds are embedded in ambient gas , representing the atomic cold neutral medium ( cnm ) .",
    "this material is set to have @xmath28 .",
    "we introduce supersonic turbulence in order to approximate the velocity and density fluctuations present in observed gmcs .",
    "our method borrows from turbulent - box type simulations with a few key differentiating features .",
    "a random velocity field is initialized within the gmc material .",
    "this velocity field is chosen to be purely solenoidal in nature and is created via a 3d power spectrum following the relation @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the wavenumber for an eddy diameter @xmath31 .",
    "all modes within this range are excited .",
    "we chose the minimum @xmath32-mode to be that spanning our cloud diameters , i.e. , setting the largest - scale turbulent velocities , and the maximum @xmath32-mode to be ten times greater so that our fiducial range for both clouds is @xmath33 for simulation volume length @xmath34 .",
    "turbulence will then cascade to smaller scales ( larger @xmath32 numbers ) , eventually limited by numerical resolution , during the course of the simulation .",
    "note that we do not initialize turbulence in the surrounding ambient medium .",
    "we adopt this method for simplicity in order to focus on the gmcs , and because we expect the dynamical effects of sub - sonic turbulence in the atomic envelope to be relatively low .",
    "the scaling of the turbulence is chosen such that the gmcs are initialized to be moderately super virial , i.e. , with a 1d velocity dispersion of @xmath35 so that the virial parameter @xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds with mach numbers measured within the clouds of @xmath37 ( for @xmath38  k conditions ) .",
    "since we do not drive turbulence , the kinetic energy content decays within a few dynamical times due to internal shocks , leading to lower velocity dispersions and lower values of @xmath39 .",
    "note also that the gmcs are somewhat confined by the pressure of the ambient , uniform density medium . observed gmcs appear to have smaller virial parameters , @xmath40 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially when considering their position - velocity connected , @xmath0co - emitting structures @xcite .",
    "our choice of initializing with a larger kinetic energy content is motivated by the desire to not have rapid global collapse of the clouds within the first few myr , i.e. , the timescale of the collision .",
    "the simulation box is initialized with a large - scale uniform magnetic field directed at an angle ( @xmath41 ) relative to the collision axis of the clouds .",
    "the fiducial direction is @xmath42 , though various orientations are explored .",
    "the fiducial magnetic field strength is set to be @xmath43 , following zeeman measurements of gmc field strengths @xcite .",
    "additionally , we test non - magnetized as well as more strongly magnetized ( @xmath44 ) cases to explore the effects of magnetic field strength .",
    "we define magnetic criticality via the dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio @xmath45 in this case , we calculate the mass - to - flux ratio by averaging over the cross section of one gmc through the volume of the box , including ambient gas .",
    "this yields @xmath46 .",
    "thus our gmcs are magnetically supercritical and so should be able to undergo global collapse if their internal turbulence is at a small enough level .    the default relative collision velocity of the clouds is chosen to be @xmath47 , though values of 5 and 20 @xmath48 are also explored",
    "the cnm envelope of each gmc is assumed to be co - moving with the cloud and thus is also colliding at the same relative velocity . in terms of the simulation domain ,",
    "half the volume is initialized with a velocity @xmath49 while the other half moves with @xmath50 .",
    "generally , the simulations are run for 5 myr .",
    "the freefall time for the adopted initial density of the clouds is @xmath51)^{1/2}\\simeq 4.35 $ ]  myr , but @xmath52 for the denser substructures created by turbulence is much less .",
    "most of the analysis is performed at a time 4  myr after the beginning of the simulations , though the time - evolution of various cloud properties is also explored .",
    "the initial conditions of the set - up are shown in figure  [ fig : initial ] and their properties are summarized in table  [ tab : initial ] .",
    "a complete list of models , illustrating the range of parameter space explored , is shown in table  [ tab : all_runs ] . in our subsequent discussion",
    ", we shall refer to models 1 and 2 as the `` fiducial colliding '' and `` fiducial non - colliding '' models , respectively , while the remaining models ( 3 - 11 ) will be collectively referred to as the `` parameter models . ''",
    ".initial simulation properties [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     strong differences between the two models are revealed through the velocity dispersion , with the colliding case showing indications of much greater dispersion .",
    "the largest velocity dispersion of @xmath53  km / s is seen along the collision axis , while the orthogonal directions also experience greater dispersion relative to the non - colliding case . the rms velocity dispersion over the 3 lines of sight is 3.01  km / s for the colliding case and 1.58  km / s for the non - colliding case .",
    "the velocity gradients reveal differences as well .",
    "the largest velocity gradient occurs when looking in the direction of the collisional impact parameter , at @xmath54  km / s / pc . however , the gradients along the remaining directions are similar in magnitude and even somewhat smaller when compared with the non - colliding case .",
    "the rms velocity gradient over the 3 lines of sight is 0.1022  km / s / pc for the colliding case and 0.0743  km / s / pc for the non - colliding case .",
    "overall , the kinematics measured in the fiducial colliding case are in rough agreement with the ten observed irdcs and associated gmcs from ht15 , in which velocity dispersions of order @xmath3few km / s and velocity gradients generally at @xmath30.1 ( but upwards of @xmath30.6 - 0.7 ) km / s / pc were found , though these results do not necessarily preclude the non - colliding case .",
    "however , the kinematics of observed irdcs , especially those with higher measured values of velocity gradient and dispersion , may suggest a more dynamic formation scenario with compression of gmc material .",
    "virial analysis of clouds compares the relative importance of self - gravity with internal motions and can reveal dynamical properties of the material and , in turn , provide evidence for recent kinematic history .",
    "ht15 performed virial analysis on ten observed irdcs and associated gmcs based on @xmath0co(@xmath1=1 - 0 ) emission and found that irdcs have moderately enhanced velocity dispersions and virial parameters relative to gmcs , potentially indicating more disturbed kinematics of the densest gas .",
    "if gmc collisions indeed trigger the formation of irdcs and then star clusters , virial analysis may be another important diagnostic for the products of cloud collisions .",
    "we follow the `` simple extraction ( se ) '' and `` connected extraction ( ce ) '' techniques detailed in ht15 , applying them to our fiducial colliding and non - colliding models .",
    "first , we calculate the cloud center of mass in @xmath55-@xmath55-@xmath56-space based on @xmath0co(@xmath1=1 - 0 ) intensity .",
    "se selects all voxels with @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) emission out to radii of @xmath57=5,10,20 , and 30  pc and within a @xmath58 line - of - sight velocity range .",
    "ce , on the other hand , selects voxels directly connected face - wise in @xmath55-@xmath55-@xmath56-space .",
    "each must exceed the same @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) intensity threshold of @xmath59  k as in ht15 , i.e. , the galactic ring survey ( grs ) @xcite @xmath60 level .",
    "the connected voxel must also lie within a 30  pc radius and @xmath61 velocity .",
    "all connected structures in the @xmath55-@xmath55-@xmath56 domain are found via the established graph theory method of connected components of undirected graphs , with cells meeting the above - mentioned criteria acting as the nodes .",
    "the subgraph with the largest number of nodes is designated as the connected extraction , and further analysis is performed on this subset of voxels .    for ce ,",
    "three different radii are calculated , based on various definitions : the mass - weighted radius ( @xmath62 ; the mean projected radial distance of cloud mass from the center of mass ) , areal radius ( @xmath63 ; from the total projected area @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the pixel number and area , respectively , of the defined cloud ) , and half - mass radius ( @xmath67 ; the radius from the center of mass that contains half the total cloud mass ) .    to study virialization of the cloud",
    ", we use the dimensionless virial parameter @xmath39 from @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mass - averaged line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",
    "figure  [ fig : virial1 ] shows the time evolution of the @xmath0co(@xmath1=1 - 0 ) integrated intensity maps for the fiducial colliding and non - colliding cases and the corresponding virial radii .",
    "for both models , the @xmath0co(@xmath1=1 - 0 ) structures grow in extent and encompass more material , leading to increasing effective radii .",
    "a central dominant filamentary structure forms in the colliding case , whereas the non - colliding case contains a number of smaller , more spatially separated filaments .",
    "the @xmath0co emission is generally weaker and more dispersed in independent structures in the non - colliding case .",
    "the chosen method for extraction successfully tracks the same singlelargest filamentary structure over time as it evolves in both cases .    the virial parameter and constituent variables for all models for the three @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 lines of sight are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : virial2 ] . these variables within the ce show distinctive trends over time as well as systematic differences between various models .",
    "the total mass of the main connected @xmath0co - defined structure grows steadily over time .",
    "the fiducial colliding case produces structures that grow from @xmath73 to just under @xmath74 over 3 myr .",
    "the non - colliding case grows at a similar rate , but generally contains @xmath310 times less mass .",
    "the @xmath75  km / s model creates higher - mass structures at earlier times , but converges to just over @xmath74 by @xmath76  myr .",
    "the @xmath77  km / s case follows an intermediate growth evolution .",
    "the @xmath78,@xmath79 , and @xmath80 cases have similar mass evolution , with slightly smaller masses corresponding to increasing values of @xmath41 .",
    "the total structure mass for the @xmath81 and @xmath82 cases grow in a similar manner .",
    "the non - magnetized colliding and non - colliding cases follow similar evolution as the fiducial colliding and non - colliding cases , respectively , but do grow to slightly larger masses in general due to the lack of magnetic pressure support .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the @xmath0co emitting structures are found to grow throughout the time evolution for all cases , generally starting near @xmath83  km / s and reaching 2 - 3  km / s .",
    "the colliding cases in general show distinctly higher velocity dispersions , especially when viewing along the collision axis ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "faster collision velocities result in larger velocity dispersions , while there does not seem to be much dependence on initial magnetic field direction .",
    "stronger magnetic fields appear to dampen the collision , resulting in slightly smaller values of @xmath69 .",
    "the measured areal radii generally grow in a similar manner as the mass , although there is a strong dependence on viewing direction .",
    "specifically , the @xmath72-directed line - of - sight , in which the plane - of - sky is sensitive to both the collision and impact parameter axes , shows a much greater radius in all cases . along this direction , the radii",
    "are measured to increase from approximately 1  pc to 10  pc in all cases , though colliding cases in general created larger structures by a few pc .",
    "the higher velocity collisions grow much faster initially , but reach similar final spatial extents . along the other lines of sight",
    ", there are similar trends , although the initial and final radii are approximately a factor of 10 smaller in these directions .",
    "the general trend for all models is for the virial parameter to decrease over time , which appears to be mostly driven by the accumulation of more and more mass into the structures .",
    "the calculated radii of the structures have a strong dependence on viewing direction , as described above , thus affecting @xmath39 as well . in the @xmath72 line - of - sight , where more extended structure is detected ,",
    "the virial parameter values begin moderately super - virial but evolve to approach those expected of virial equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath84 ( recall @xmath85 implies a gravitationally bound structure , ignoring surface pressure and magnetic pressure effects ) . for other viewing directions ,",
    "@xmath39 of the structure is generally smaller , often already sub - virial .",
    "systematic differences in @xmath39 between models are less distinct than from viewing direction , with virial parameters decreasing by factors of a few over time . despite the small differences , the smallest values of @xmath39",
    "are present in the non - magnetized cases .",
    "overall , some of these structures them may be undergoing rapid global collapse , but more likely in the magnetized cases the @xmath86-fields are providing support that may keep them closer to virial equilbrium .",
    "we expect that : ( 1 ) the structures will continue to accumulate mass and become even more gravitationally bound ; ( 2 ) they are likely to contain highly gravitationally unstable substructures , e.g. , the dense filaments and clumps that appear from 3 to 4 myr in the fiducial colliding case .    results from the 10 irdcs / gmcs studied in ht15 show relatively large variation of derived virial parameter depending on the analysis method : in particular , the most relevant method for comparison with our analysis is `` ce,@xmath87 '' , i.e. , connected extraction of a structure where an optical depth correction has been assessed , and where the velocity dispersion is measured directly from the second moment of the spectrum .",
    "this method finds values of @xmath84 , but with significant dispersion of about a factor of two . still these values are somewhat larger than those seen in most of our simulations at @xmath88  myr . in the context of the gmc - gmc collision scenario",
    ", this may indicate that the relevant timescale for comparison is at earlier times , e.g. , @xmath89 to 2  myr , or that the typical line of sight to gmcs is in a direction that includes a significant component of the collision velocity axis ( which is likely for collisions mediated by shear in the galactic disk ) .",
    "while the values of @xmath39 are similar between all of the simulations , ranging from slightly to strongly gravitationally bound objects , the total masses and velocity dispersion are notably larger for the colliding cases .",
    "thus we conclude that , in comparison to the @xmath0co emitting structures formed in non - colliding simulations , those formed via gmc collisions are more likely to lead to the conditions necessary for massive star cluster formation .",
    "we have investigated physical properties associated with and potential observational signatures of magnetized , turbulent gmcs collisions .",
    "our method has utilized pdr - based heating and cooling functions , developed in our previous study with 2d simulations , to allow our new 3d simulations , with resolution of 0.125  pc , to follow the multi - phase , non - equilibrium , thermal evolution of the clouds , including their shock structures .",
    "we have explored the parameter space of gmc collisions , including the effects of collision velocity , impact parameter , magnetic field orientation and strength .",
    "we have also carried out detailed comparisons of the results of otherwise identical colliding and non - colliding clouds .",
    "we have found that the relative orientations between magnetic fields and mass surface density structures may be used to diagnose a cloud collision .",
    "hros and subsequent histogram shape parameter analysis reveal distinguishing behavior resulting from cloud collisions compared with non - colliding clouds .",
    "in particular , the collision velocity appears to have a strong effect on the hro shape parameter .",
    "the dependence on line of sight is fairly low , strengthening the @xmath90 vs. @xmath91 diagnostic .",
    "the @xmath92 vs. @xmath93 relation found in our models reveals somewhat stronger magnetic field strength when compared to the `` crutcher relation '' , although the general trend appears to follow @xmath94 at higher densities while staying near roughly constant @xmath92 at lower densities .",
    "this behavior is likely sensitive to our choices of initial conditions , but may be representative of regions of slightly higher mean field strength compared to the relatively nearby objects which comprise the `` crutcher relation ''",
    ".    area and mass - weighted @xmath91-pdfs show large differences among our models , with strong distinguishing factors between colliding and non - colliding cases .",
    "although it is just a single case , a comparison with the @xmath91-pdf of an observed irdc finds that the evolved gmc collision cases have more similar @xmath91-pdfs than the results of non - colliding simulations .",
    "intensity mapping of co spectra , especially the @xmath2co(@xmath1=8 - 7)/@xmath0co(@xmath1=2 - 1 ) line intensity ratio , is another potentially strong diagnostic of cloud collisions . from synthetic spectra of our models , the integrated intensities , as well as the velocity spread ,",
    "are differentiators between colliding and non - colliding gmcs and both appear to be generally independent of line of sight orientation .",
    "kinematically , the velocity dispersion of the colliding case was found to be much higher than that of the non - colliding case , at almost a factor of 2 higher , reaching @xmath95 when measured along the collision axis .",
    "velocity gradients are also enhanced due to collisions , with the highest values in the colliding case measured when viewing orientation is along the same direction that the clouds are offset via the impact parameter , at @xmath96 .",
    "finally , study of the @xmath0co - defined structures formed in the colliding and non - colliding scenarios are quite different . in all of the colliding cases , they are much more massive with generally larger velocity dispersion .",
