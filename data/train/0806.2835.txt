    "<S> we use baryon acoustic peak measurements by @xcite and @xcite , together with the wmap measurement of the apparent acoustic horizon angle , and galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements of @xcite , to constrain a slowly rolling scalar field dark energy model , @xmath0cdm , in which dark energy s energy density changes in time . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare our @xmath0cdm results with those derived for two more common dark energy models : the time - independent cosmological constant model , @xmath1cdm , and the xcdm parametrization of dark energy s equation of state . for time - independent dark energy , </S>",
    "<S> the @xcite measurements effectively constrain spatial curvature and favor a close to spatially - flat model , mostly due to the wmap cmb prior used in the analysis . in a spatially - flat model </S>",
    "<S> the @xcite data less effectively constrain time - varying dark energy . the joint baryon acoustic peak and galaxy cluster gas mass constraints on @xmath0cdm model are consistent with but tighter than those derived from other data . a time - independent cosmological constant in a spatially - flat model provides a good fit to the joint data , while the @xmath2 parameter in the inverse power law potential @xmath0cdm model is constrained to be less than about 4 at 3@xmath3 confidence level . </S>"
