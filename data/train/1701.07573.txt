    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most energetic phenomenon occurred in the cosmological distance .",
    "the luminosity of grbs can reach the order of around @xmath1 .",
    "there are various models to explain the energy source of grbs .",
    "the popular model for the generation of short grbs is the mergers of compact binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , either black hole - neutron star binaries or double neutron stars . and",
    "it is commonly believed that the collapse of a massive star can account for long grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both cases ,",
    "a dense accretion disk is expected to form , with extremely high temperature and accretion rates .",
    "the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation process is a possible mechanism to provide energy for the bursts .",
    "the other mechanism based on hyper - accretion disks around black holes is the well - known blandford - znajek ( bz ) process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , a rapidly rotating neutron star with strong magnetic fields can also be responsible for grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we will focus on the hyper - accreting disks with extremely high accretion rates ( @xmath2 ) , where the neutrino radiation may be a dominant cooling mechanism , and therefore such flows are usually named as neutrino - dominated accretion flows ( ndafs ) .",
    "@xcite pioneered to study the ndafs in details , and proposed that the neutrino annihilation of a hyper - accreting black hole system can explain grbs up to @xmath3 .",
    "the hyper - accreting black hole system typically has accretion rates around @xmath4 .",
    "the ndafs have been widely studied on the radial structure and neutrino radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and time - dependent variation @xcite .",
    "the density can reach @xmath5 in the inner region of the disk , and the temperature can be up to @xmath6 .",
    "such disks can be extremely optically thick , leading to the trapping of large portion of photons , which are carried along the radial direction and are eventually absorbed by the central black hole .",
    "thus , the neutrino cooling is the dominant cooling process in the inner part .",
    "recently , whether the neutrino annihilation process can work as the central engine for grbs has been investigated in more details @xcite .",
    "such works revealed that the neutrino annihilation process can account for most grbs .",
    "for some long - duration grbs , the central engine is more likely to be the bz mechanism rather than the neutrino annihilation since the former is much more efficient . on the other hand",
    ", if the x - ray flares after the prompt gamma - ray emission are regarded as the reactivity of the central engine , the neutrino annihilation mechanism may encounter difficulty in interpreting the x - ray flares . even including a possible magnetic coupling @xcite between the inner disk and the central black hole , @xcite showed that the annihilation mechanism can work for the x - ray flares with duration @xmath7 .",
    "however , the annihilation mechanism is unlikely to be responsible for those long flares with duration @xmath8 , even though the role of magnetic coupling is included .",
    "more recently , @xcite investigated the central engine of the extremely late - time x - ray flares with peak time larger than @xmath9 s , and suggested that neither the neutrino annihilation nor the bz process seems to work well .",
    "instead , a fast rotating neutron star with strong bipolar magnetic fields may account for such flares .",
    "recent simulations have made significant progress on the super - eddington accretion process , including the presence of strong outflows @xcite and the radiation - powered baryonic jet @xcite .",
    "in addition , some simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show the anisotropic feature of radiation .",
    "more importantly , the simulation of @xcite revealed a new energy transport mechanism in addition to the diffusion , which is named as the vertical advection .",
    "their simulation results show that , for the super - eddington accretion rate @xmath10 , the radiative efficiency is around 4.5% , which is comparable to the value in a standard thin disk model .",
    "the physical reason is that , a large fraction of photons can escape from the disk before being advected into the black hole , through the vertical advection process based on the magnetic buoyancy , which dominates over the photon diffusion process .    in this work ,",
    "following the spirit of the vertical advection , we incorporate the vertical advection process into ndafs and revisit the structure and radiation of hyper - accretion disks around stellar - mass black holes .",
    "the remainder is organized as follows .",
    "the basic physics and equations for our model are described in section  [ sec : equa ] .",
    "numerical results and analyses are presented in section  [ sec : resu ] .",
    "conclusions and discussion are made in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section we describe the basic equations of our model . we consider a steady state , axisymmetric hyper - accretion disk around a stellar - mass black hole .",
    "the well - known paczyski - wiita potential @xcite is adopted , i.e. , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the black hole mass and @xmath13 is the schwarzschild radius . the keplerian angular velocity can be expressed as @xmath14 .",
    "we use the usual convention of quantities to describe the accretion disk : the half - thickness of the disk is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the isothermal sound speed , with @xmath17 being the pressure , and @xmath18 the density .",
    "we adopt the standard shakura - sunyaev prescription for the kinematic viscosity coefficient , i.e. @xmath19 .    the basic equations that describe the accretion disk are the continuity , azimuthal momentum , energy equation , and the equation of state .",
    "the continuity equation is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radial velocity . with the keplerian rotation assumption @xmath22",
    ", the azimuthal momentum equation can be simplified as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 represents the specific angular momentum per unit mass accreted by the black hole .",
    "the equation of state takes the form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath27 where the four terms on the right - hand side are the gas pressure , radiation pressure of photons , degeneracy pressure of electrons , and radiation pressure of neutrinos , respectively .",
    "the energy equation is written as @xmath28 the above equation shows the balance between the viscous heating and the cooling by radial advection , vertical advection , and neutrino radiation .",
    "the viscous heating rate @xmath29 and the advective cooling rate @xmath30 for a half - disk above or below the equator are expressed as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the temperature , @xmath34 is the specific entropy , @xmath35 is the neutrino energy density , and @xmath36 is taken to be @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the mass fraction of free nucleons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath39 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 is the cooling rate due to the neutrino radiation .",
    "we adopt a bridging formula for calculating @xmath43 as shown in @xcite and @xcite .    the main difference from previous works",
    "is that the vertical advection term @xmath44 is taken into account in our work , which is written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy density of photons , @xmath35 is the energy density of neutrinos , @xmath47 is the energy density of the gas . in our calculation",
    "the third term @xmath48 is dropped since the escaped gas through the magnetic buoyancy can be negligible .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is the averaged velocity of the vertical advection process , which can be simply written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a dimensionless parameter . by comparing the typical vertical velocity @xmath49 in the simulation results ( figure 14 of * ? ? ? * ) and the theoretical estimate of sound speed , we take @xmath52 for our numerical calculations .",
    "the vertical advection term describes the released photons and neutrinos due to the magnetic buoyancy , which can dominate over normal diffusion process .",
    "equations  ( [ continuity])-([energy ] ) can be solved if the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath26 are given .",
    "we consider a stellar - mass black hole with @xmath55 .",
    "the viscous parameter @xmath56 is taken from the simulation results @xcite .",
    "the specific angular momentum @xmath57 is just a little less than the keplerian angular momentum at the marginally stable orbit , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "our study focuses on the solutions in the range @xmath59 .",
    "in this section we present our numerical results and the analyses of the physics behind these results .",
    "the calculation reveals that the vertical advection process has essential effects on the structure and radiation of the disk .",
    "first , the radial profiles of mass density and temperature are investigated for two cases , i.e. , with and without the vertical advection process .",
    "the radial profiles of density @xmath18 are shown in figure  [ f:01 ] , where the solid ( dashed ) lines correspond to the results with ( without ) the vertical advection process .",
    "the five typical mass accretion rates are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath37 , and @xmath63 , which are shown by different colors .",
    "it is seen from figure  [ f:01 ] that , for a certain radius @xmath64 and a given @xmath65 , the density @xmath18 in the disk with vertical advection process is significantly higher than that without such a process , particularly for low accretion rates such as @xmath66 .",
    "the radial profiles of temperature @xmath33 are shown in figure  [ f:02 ] , where the explanation of different color and types of lines is the same as in figure  [ f:01 ] .",
    "it is seen that the temperature of the disk with the vertical advection is generally lower than that without the advection .",
    "the physical understanding of the above difference in density and temperature is as follows .",
    "since a large fraction of the trapped photons can be released through the vertical advection process , the radiative cooling through such a process is efficient . as a consequence , the temperature @xmath33 together with the total pressure @xmath17 , the vertical height @xmath67 , and the radial velocity @xmath68 will decrease , whereas the mass density @xmath18 will increase .",
    "for relatively low accretion rates such as @xmath69 , the radiative cooling of neutrinos is quite inefficient , so the effects of vertical advection may be more significant , as indicated by equation  ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f:03 ] shows the radial profiles of vertical scale height of the disk .",
    "it is seen that the relative height @xmath67 of the disk with vertical advection is significantly thinner than that without the vertical advection , particularly for low accretion rates . the physical reason is mentioned above , which is related to the decrease of temperature and pressure .",
    "the decrease of vertical height also implies the decrease of sound speed and therefore the decrease of radial velocity , as inferred by equation  ( [ momentum ] ) .    for a typical mass accretion rate @xmath70 ,",
    "figure  [ f:04 ] shows the radial profiles of energy components , where the three dimensionless factors are @xmath71 ( red line ) , @xmath72 ( green line ) , and @xmath73 ( blue line ) .",
    "it is seen that in the most inner region ( @xmath74 ) the radial advection is the dominant cooling mechanism . for the outer part of the disk ( @xmath75 )",
    "the energy transport through the vertical advection becomes dominant .",
    "for the region @xmath76 the neutrino cooling may dominate over the other two mechanisms .",
    "the red line implies that the photon radiation through the vertical advection process can reach a large fraction of the total released gravitational energy , and therefore the photon luminosity can be extremely super - eddington .",
    "we will investigate the corresponding photon luminosity in figure  [ f:06 ] .",
    "our main focus is the energy transport through vertical advection process .",
    "figure  [ f:05 ] shows the radial profiles of the dimensionless cooling rate due to the vertical advection , i.e. , @xmath71 , where five typical accretion rates are adopted .",
    "it is seen that @xmath77 generally decreases with increasing @xmath65 .",
    "the physical reason is that the neutrino cooling is less important for relative low accretion rates . for the highest accretion rate with @xmath78",
    ", the red line shows that there exists a big bump in the inner region ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the physics for this bump is that the neutrino cooling is again less significant since the inner disk is optically thick to the neutrinos .",
    "finally , we calculate the neutrino luminosity and the photon luminosity of the accretion disk .",
    "the neutrino luminosity is derived by the integration of the whole disk : @xmath80 where @xmath81 includes the contributions from the direct neutrino radiation @xmath82 and the vertical advection process on neutrinos @xmath83 . actually , the latter is negligible except for extremely high accretion rates @xmath84 .",
    "the variation of neutrino luminosity with mass accretion rates is shown in figure  [ f:06 ] , where the red solid line corresponds to the neutrino luminosity with the vertical advection process , whereas the red dashed line corresponds to the neutrino luminosity without the process .",
    "it is seen that the red solid line is under the red dashed line , which means that the neutrino luminosity with the vertical advection is lower .",
    "the physical reason is as follows .",
    "the neutrino radiation is more sensitive to the temperature than the density .",
    "as shown by figure  [ f:02 ] , the disk temperature is lower for the case with the vertical advection .",
    "thus , the corresponding @xmath82 and @xmath81 in our cases are lower than those without the vertical advection .",
    "the variation of photon luminosity @xmath85 is shown by the blue solid line in figure  [ f:06 ] , where @xmath85 is calculated by @xmath86 it is seen that @xmath85 is in the range @xmath87 for @xmath88 , which is more than ten orders of magnitude higher than the eddington luminosity .",
    "the released photons are mainly in the gamma - ray band according to the thermal radiation of the inner disk with @xmath89 , as shown by figure  [ f:02 ] .",
    "the huge amount of gamma - ray photons escape from the optically thick disk through the vertical advection process , which is much more efficient than the diffusion process .",
    "such an extremely high photon radiation should have observational effects .",
    "we will have a discussion on that in next section .",
    "in this work , we have studied the structure and radiation of hyper - accretion flows around stellar - mass black holes by taking into the role of vertical advection process . by the comparison of our results with the classic ndaf solutions",
    ", we have shown that the density is higher , the temperature is lower , and the vertical height is thinner in our solutions .",
    "the physical reason is that a large fraction of photons can escape from the optically thick disk through the vertical advection process . as a consequence , the neutrino luminosity from the disk is decreased .",
    "thus , even without calculating the neutrino annihilation luminosity , we can conclude that the annihilation mechanism can not be responsible for the long - duration grbs and x - ray flares .",
    "we would point out that outflows are not taken into consideration in the present work .",
    "however , outflows are believed to generally exist in accretion flows .",
    "recent mhd simulations have shown that outflows exist both in optically thin flows @xcite and optically thick flows @xcite . from the observational view",
    ", @xcite reveals that more than 99% of the accreted mass escape from the accretion flow by outflows in our galactic center .",
    "based on the energy balance argument , @xcite shows that the outflow is inevitable for the accretion flows where the radiative cooling is far below the viscous heating , no matter the flow is optically thin or thick .",
    "thus , outflows may work as another process to help the trapped photons to escape @xcite , and will also have effects on the structure and neutrino radiation of the accretion flow .",
    "such a mechanism is not included in the current work .",
    "our calculations are based on the relation @xmath90 with @xmath52 .",
    "as mentioned in section  2 , the value for @xmath51 is adopted following the simulation results for @xmath91 @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is higher for more than ten orders of magnitude .",
    "then , a key question may exist whether the vertical advection due to the magnetic buoyancy can also work for such hyper - accretion systems . in our opinion ,",
    "the radiation pressure is always dominant up to @xmath92 or for the outer part of even higher accretion rates .",
    "thus , such a mechanism seems to be an efficient process . on the other hand , even for the case",
    "that the parameter @xmath51 is significantly smaller than @xmath62 in the hyper - accretion case , such as several orders of magnitude smaller , the released gamma - ray photons may still be extremely super - eddington and the potential application is significant .    in this work",
    "we have assumed @xmath56 according to the simulation results of @xcite .",
    "however , other simulations may provide different values for @xmath54 .",
    "as shown by @xcite , such a value may be related to the magnitude of net magnetic flux in the simulations .",
    "the values of @xmath54 may also have significant effects on the energy transport of the vertical advection . as equations  ( [ momentum ] ) and ( [ qadv ] ) imply",
    ", @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath54 and @xmath30 is proportional to @xmath21 and therefore @xmath54 .",
    "thus , we can expect that , for a larger value of @xmath54 , the advective cooling rate @xmath30 can significantly increase and therefore the cooling rate due to the vertical advection @xmath93 will decrease according to the energy balance of equation  ( [ energy ] ) . nevertheless , the luminosity related to the radial integration of @xmath93 will still be hyper - eddington even though @xmath93 may be lower than @xmath30 for a large range of radii .    our results of extremely super - eddington luminosity of gamma - ray emission",
    "can also be generally applied to short grbs .",
    "it is commonly believed that short grbs originate from the merger of compact objects , i.e. , the black hole - neutron star binary or the binary with double neutron stars .",
    "more importantly , the merger is a significant source of gravitational wave event .",
    "thus , the released high - energy photons may have significant contribution to an electromagnetic counterpart for the gravitational wave event , such as kilonovae .",
    "kilonovae have been widely studied in recent years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our case ,",
    "a new picture is shown by figure  [ f:07 ] .",
    "it is seen from this figure that , either the merger of a black hole and a neutron star or the merger of two neutron stars may result in a gravitational wave event and a black hole hyper - accretion disk . according to our study in this work , most gamma - ray photons escaping from the direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane together with the neutrino annihilation contribute to the thermal fireball , and the remanent escaped photons diverge from other directions to trigger non - thermal emission due to diffusion into ambient environment .",
    "obviously , such a progenitor of kilonovae is quite different from the origin from disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or magnetar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a faint gamma - ray thermal component may exist owing to the large amount of escaped thermal gamma - ray photons from the disk , which may have potential contribution to the thermal component of the prompt gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "moreover , the neutrino annihilation mechanism or the bz mechanism based on the accumulation of magnetic fields through the hyper - accretion process will work as the main central engine for the grb . in summary , in our scenario of black hole hyper - accretion with vertical advection process , short grbs , kilonovae , and gravitational wave events can be naturally blended together ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> recent simulations on super - eddington accretion flows have shown that , apart from the diffusion process , the vertical advection based on magnetic buoyancy can be a more efficient process to release the trapped photons in the optically thick disk . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the radiative luminosity from the accretion disk can be far beyond the eddington value . following this spirit , we revisit the structure and radiation of hyper - accretion disks with mass accretion rates in the range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that , due to the strong cooling through the vertical advection , the disk temperature becomes lower than that in the classic model without the vertical advection process , and therefore the neutrino luminosity from the disk is lower . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the gamma - ray photons released through the vertical advection can be extremely super - eddington . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the large amount of escaped gamma - ray photons may have more significant contribution to the primordial fireball than the neutrino annihilation , and may hint a link between gamma - ray bursts and kilonovae in the black hole hyper - accretion scenario . </S>"
