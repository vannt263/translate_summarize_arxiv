    "arising from the light deflection by the inhomogeneous mass distribution of the universe , gravitational weak - lensing effects have been applied to map out , individually or statistically , the mass distribution of galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and large - scale structures ( e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; mandelbaum et al .",
    "2008 ; li et al . 2009 ; clowe et al . 2006 ; corless et al . 2009 ; fu et al .",
    "deep observations also reveal the time evolution of the structure formation ( massey et al .",
    "cosmic shear analyses have been used to constrain different cosmological parameters ( e.g. , benjamin et al .",
    "2007 ; kilbinger 2009 ; li et al . 2009 ) .",
    "future wide and deep weak - lensing surveys will give rise to observational data with greatly improved quantity and quality .",
    "therefore the derived cosmological information is expected to be much more accurate than that of today , which will make the weak - lensing effect one of the most important probes in cosmology , notably , in understanding the nature of dark energy ( e.g. , albrecht et al .",
    "however , it has been realized that weak - lensing effects are not as clean as they appear to be .",
    "being very weak , they can be affected and contaminated easily by different observational and physical effects .",
    "considerable efforts have been paid to understand these effects and their influences on cosmological studies ( e.g. , tang & fan 2005 ; heymans et al .",
    "2006 ; ma et al . 2006",
    "; huterer et al . 2006 ; bridle & king 2007 ; fan 2007 ; amara & refregier 2008 ; sun et al .",
    "2009 ) .    among others , intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies are known to dominate over their weak - lensing induced shear signals by a large factor .",
    "the environmental dependence of galaxy formation can lead to intrinsic - intrinsic and shear - intrinsic correlations , which can contaminate directly the two - point weak - lensing shear correlations at percent to tens of percent level ( e.g. , hirata & seljak 2004 ; mandelbaum et al .",
    "2006 ; fan 2007 ; zhang 2008 ; joachimi & schneider 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , in reconstructing the foreground mass distribution from shear measurements of background galaxies , their intrinsic ellipticities leave considerable noise even if they are completely random ( e.g. , van waerbeke 2000 ; hamana et al .",
    "2004 ; white et al . 2002 ) .",
    "understanding fully the statistical properties of the noise field and the mutual influence between noise and the true lensing effects are therefore crucially important in studies aiming to reveal the mass distribution of large - scale structures .",
    "particularly , chance alignments of intrinsic ellipticities can form false peaks in a lensing convergence map , and mimic dark clumps , namely structures with large mass to light ratios ( e.g. , erben et al . 2000 ; linden et al .",
    "2006 ; gavazzi & soucail 2007 ; schirmer et al . 2007 ; fan 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , noise can affect true lensing signals , causing large scatters and possibly systematic biases to them .",
    "these can lead to considerable uncertainties in analyzing the mass distribution of clusters of galaxies , in investigating the possible existence of dark clumps , and in deriving constraints on cosmological parameters from weak - lensing cluster abundances .",
    "different statistical methods have been developed to suppress such noise in weak - lensing mass reconstructions , and the smoothing is one of the simplest ways for doing so .",
    "given the rms of intrinsic ellipticities , the amplitude of the smoothed noise depends on the smoothing scale and on the surface number density of source galaxies thus the observational depth ( e.g. , van waerbeke 2000 ) . because of the central limit theorem , it is expected that the statistics of the noise field after smoothing should be close to gaussian if a large enough number of galaxies are included within the smoothing window . by employing a gaussian smoothing function , van waerbeke ( 2000 )",
    "shows that the noise field of the convergence is indeed approximately gaussian .",
    "he further analyzes its properties , such as the number and the shape distribution of the noise peaks .",
    "fan ( 2007 ) extends the study by including the intrinsic alignment of background galaxies in the analyses , and shows that the number of false peaks are enhanced depending on the strength of the intrinsic alignment .",
    "schneider ( 1996 ) consider the effects of noise on the height of the peaks associated with true mass concentrations in aperture - mass maps by adding a gaussian scatter to the peak height .",
    "from numerical simulations , hamana et al .",
    "( 2004 ) analyze noise effects on true peaks , and present a phenomenological correction to the abundance of weak - lensing detected peaks . in this paper",
    ", we put forward a theoretical model to study the mutual influence of noise and true peaks .",
    "specifically , we consider the lensing effects of a cluster of galaxies taking into account noise from intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies .",
    "we investigate the effect of the density profile of the cluster on the distribution of noise peaks , and conversely , how noise can change the true peak signal of the cluster .",
    "based on these analyses and the mass function of dark matter halos , we develop a model to compute statistically weak - lensing convergence peak abundances over a large field , including both the peaks associated with clusters of galaxies and the false ones from noise .",
    "therefore we can use convergence peaks directly as cosmological probes without the need to sort out true and false peaks .",
    "moreover , the distribution of noise peaks depends on the density profile of true clusters , and thus contains additional cosmological information , which is naturally included in our model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we present our theoretical framework .",
    "the results are shown in  3 with  3.1 for individual cluster cases and  3.2 for statistical results on a large field . ",
    "4 contains summaries and discussions .",
    "with the intrinsic ones taken into account , the observed ellipticities of source galaxies can be written in the weak lensing regime as ( e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the complex lensing shear due to the foreground mass distributions , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the observed and the intrinsic complex ellipticities of source galaxies , respectively .",
    "the corresponding smoothed quantities are @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the smoothed @xmath22 and @xmath27 , respectively , @xmath28 is the smoothing function , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the surface number density and the total number of source galaxies in the field .    the lensing convergence @xmath31 can be obtained from the shear through their following relation in the fourier space @xmath32 where the summation over @xmath33 is implied , and @xmath34 $ ] with @xmath35 ( kaiser & squires 1993 ) .",
    "then the real - space convergence reconstructed from the observed ellipticities is @xmath36 where @xmath31 and @xmath37 are the lensing convergence and the noise from the intrinsic ellipticities , respectively . after smoothing ,",
    "we have @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 the corresponding smoothed @xmath31 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is therefore clear that in order to extract the true @xmath39 from the noisy @xmath41 , we must understand the influence of @xmath40 .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly consider foreground clusters of galaxies as lens objects .",
    "considering an individual cluster , we take @xmath42 to be the smoothed convergence of the cluster , which is determined by its assumed known density profile . the noise @xmath40 is regarded as a random field .",
    "the total @xmath43 is therefore also a random field with its statistics determined by the noise field @xmath44 and modulated by the cluster @xmath42 . concerning peaks in the noisy convergence @xmath43 around an individual cluster",
    ", there should be a dominant one corresponding to the main cluster .",
    "there are also false peaks arising from @xmath40 .",
    "it is expected while the properties of the dominant peak in @xmath43 should be closely related to those of true @xmath42 , they are inevitably affected by the existence of @xmath40 . on the other hand , the noise peaks in @xmath43",
    "should also be modulated by the cluster @xmath42 in comparison with those in pure noise field @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that the peak statistics depend not only on the value of @xmath41 , but also on its profile through the first and second derivatives of @xmath41 .",
    "thus @xmath39 and @xmath40 need to @xmath45collaborate@xmath45 to give rise to peaks in @xmath41 .",
    "therefore the peak properties in @xmath41 differ from those in @xmath40 or in @xmath39 in ways that are more complex than just changing the peak height by a value of @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "our main focus in the paper is to understand such mutual influences between @xmath39 and @xmath40 in terms of the peak properties in @xmath41 , and further their effects on relevant cosmological studies .",
    "the formulations presented in the following are for noisy @xmath43 around a cluster with a known density distribution .",
    "these set the theoretical framework for analyses presented in  3.2 on large - scale statistics beyond individual clusters incorporating the mass function of dark matter halos .",
    "it has been shown that the smoothed noise field @xmath40 is approximately gaussian because of the central limit theorem ( van waerbeke 2000 ; fan 2007 ) .",
    "for an individual cluster , its convergence @xmath39 is regarded as a known quantity .",
    "thus the statistics of the field @xmath41 is also gaussian and follows that of @xmath40 with the modifications due to the presence of @xmath39 from the cluster . for the random gaussian field @xmath41 ,",
    "its peak statistics involves random variables @xmath41 , @xmath46 ( denoted as @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 ( denoted as @xmath49 ) ( @xmath50 ) .",

    "secondly , the redshift information of the peaks is not necessary since we use the peak height distribution rather than the redshift distribution of peaks as cosmological probes .",
    "here we discuss the peak statistics around individual clusters of galaxies .",
    "two aspects are addressed .",
    "one is how the distribution of noise peaks is influenced by the density profile of a cluster .",
    "the other is how the properties of the peak corresponding to the true cluster , such as its height and position , are affected by the presence of noise . in our calculations , we assume that a considered cluster is located at the center , and the field extends to @xmath140 .",
    "our main results are presented for the two clusters shown in figure 2 .",
    "in addition , we also analyze different nfw clusters of the same mass but with different concentrations to further demonstrate the dependence of the peak statistics on cluster profiles . besides theoretical analyses , we perform monte carlo simulations with different realizations of the noise field added to the considered cluster @xmath31-map .",
    "the theoretical results are then compared with the results averaged over @xmath141 simulations for each of the clusters .    for a visual impression",
    ", we first present in figure 3 a typical set of maps from our monte carlo simulations for the two clusters shown in figure 2 .",

    "then the peaks are essentially the ones existed in the pure noise field but with their heights modified by the term @xmath130 .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xmath130 depends on the radius @xmath144 , and thus the peak statistics over a range of @xmath144 can not be described by an overall constant shift in peak height from that of @xmath40 . within @xmath1 , the peaks look very different in the two maps , which clearly shows the effects of the density profile ( @xmath131 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) in addition to the term @xmath130 . for the nfw cluster , there is a single high peak which corresponds clearly to the peak signal of the main cluster . for the isothermal cluster ,",
    "however , two prominent peaks with comparable heights occur .",
    "the positions of the peaks are also shifted from the center .",

    "the peak distributions for the two cluster profiles are distinctively different , especially in the inner region and for high peaks with @xmath4 . for the nfw cluster",
    ", high peaks are mainly found near the central region of the cluster , and the total number of high peaks is smaller than that of isothermal cluster . in the region with @xmath146 , the average numbers of peaks for @xmath147 and @xmath148 are approximately @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively , for the nfw case . for the isothermal case ,",
    "the corresponding numbers are @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "therefore , for the nfw cluster , the inner region is relatively clean and often contains a single and well defined high peak as seen in figure 3b . on the other hand , for the isothermal cluster",
    ", there are on average @xmath157 peaks with @xmath158 in the inner region , of which , one corresponds to the real cluster and the other is generated due to noise ( figure 3a ) .",
    "we further consider the inner ( @xmath2 ) and outer ( @xmath159 ) regions separately . in the outer regions ,",
    "we analyze the occurrence probability of high noise peaks , which is relevant to the dark clump problem .",
    "we emphasize , with respect to the case without clusters , the enhancement due to the cluster density distribution .",
    "figure 5a shows the distribution of the cumulative number of peaks above the threshold @xmath160 in the region @xmath161 ( @xmath139 ) and",
    "figure 5b presents the corresponding enhancement factor @xmath162 , where @xmath163 and @xmath164 denote , respectively , the cumulative numbers of peaks in the cases with and without a cluster in the center . in figure 5a , the solid , dash - dotted and dashed lines are for the isothermal cluster , the nfw cluster , and the case without a cluster , respectively . the diamond symbols and the plus symbols",
    "are for the results averaged over @xmath141 simulations of the isothermal and nfw clusters , respectively . in figure 5b , the solid and dash - dotted lines are for the corresponding enhancement factors of the two clusters .",
    "it is seen that the results are similar for the two clusters because their density profiles are similar in the outer regions as shown in figure 2 .",
    "however , differences can still be seen for high peaks . for @xmath165 ,",
    "the enhancement factor is larger for the isothermal cluster than that for the nfw cluster .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the outer regions , these high peaks are mainly found in @xmath166 , where @xmath130 is higher for the isothermal cluster ( figure 2a ) . for @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 for the isothermal cluster .",
    "the corresponding @xmath11 for the nfw cluster are @xmath175 , @xmath172 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 . therefore depending on the density profile of a cluster",
    ", the occurrence probability of high noise peaks around it can be greatly boosted .",
    "the effects are larger for higher peaks .",
    "as discussed earlier , in the outer region , the effect of the density profile of a cluster on noise peak statistics comes in mainly through the term @xmath130 .",
    "it increases the heights of the peaks originally with @xmath178 to be above the threshold @xmath179 . because of the approximately exponential dependence of @xmath180 on @xmath7 , the enhancement at @xmath181 changes sensitively with the values of @xmath130 and @xmath179 .",
    "this enhancement in outer regions can be analogous to the peak - background split scenario in explaining the biased dark matter halo distributions with respect to the dark matter mass density distribution ( bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ; mo & white 1996 ) . it is noted , however , that @xmath130 changes with radius .",
    "thus the local enhancement depends on the radius , and the overall enhancement factor @xmath11 over the outer region with @xmath161 can not be modeled by a constant shift of @xmath179 with respect to that of @xmath40 . when the observational field is comparable to the size of a cluster , we should also be aware that the mass - sheet degeneracy in lensing analyses brings some arbitrariness in the reconstructed mass distribution , which in turn affects the noise peak statistics within the field . in the weak lensing regime , this arbitrariness is mainly reflected by an additive constant to @xmath31 . in real studies , different people may choose different constants .",
    "it can be chosen so that the averaged @xmath182 in the observed field ( e.g. , erben et al .",
    "2000 ) , or to make the @xmath31 averaged over the outer - most ring of the observed field be zero ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 2003 ) .",
    "it is also attempted to recover the true mass distribution of a cluster by adjusting the constant to make the reconstructed mass distribution be consistent with the distribution determined by some other observations ( e.g. , umetsu & futamase 2000 ) . in figure 6a and figure 6b",
    ", we show @xmath11 for the isothermal and nfw clusters , respectively , by applying an additive constant to the @xmath31 field to have @xmath182 over the area of @xmath183 ( dashed ) , to have @xmath182 at @xmath184 ( dash - dotted ) .",
    "the solid lines are for the true mass distribution .",
    "it is seen that different choice of the constant results significantly different enhancements .",
    "however , even in the case of @xmath182 over the field within @xmath184 , which gives the lowest enhancement factor , @xmath185 and @xmath186 at @xmath187 for the isothermal and nfw clusters , respectively .",
    "the strong association of noise peaks with their nearby clusters can have significant effects on cosmological studies with weak lensing effects .",
    "it has been argued that the @xmath45dark clump@xmath45 found near cluster a1942 ( e.g. , erben et al .",
    "2000 ) is unlikely to be a noise peak resulting from the chance alignment of source galaxies .",
    "this is based on the peak statistics without considering the cluster environment , which gives the average number of noise peaks with @xmath188 in the considered area of @xmath189 to be about @xmath190 for @xmath0 . from our results shown here",
    ", the number of noise peaks can be increased by a factor of @xmath185 if the density profile of the cluster is approximately isothermal .",
    "this leads to an order of magnitude increase in the probability that the seen @xmath45dark clump@xmath45 near a1942 is a false one without corresponding to real mass concentrations .",
    "thus in order to properly quantify the statistical significance of a @xmath45dark clump@xmath45 near a cluster , the cluster mass distribution has to be taken into account .",
    "specifically , in observational weak lensing studies , such as the one for a1942 , one can first make an approximate modeling of the mass distribution of the main cluster from the weak lensing measurements .",
    "then our model can be applied to study the occurrence probability of noise peaks in its surrounding area .",
    "such a probability is more appropriate than the one from the blind estimate without considering the existence of the cluster itself .",
    "it should also be emphasized that this probability depends sensitively on the density profile of the cluster . moreover , because of its strong dependence on the density profile of the cluster , the spatial distribution of noise peaks can mimic , to a certain extent , the true substructure distribution within the cluster .",
    "thus the noise peaks can contaminate the cosmological information inferred from weak lensing substructure analyses .",
    "we now turn to the inner region with @xmath2 or @xmath191 .",
    "the highest peak within this region is assumed to correspond to the signal from the cluster itself .",
    "we then analyze how the height and position of this main - cluster peak are affected by the existence of noise .    in the case without noise",
    ", the expected weak lensing peak heights should be the same for a sample of clusters with the same mass distribution and at the same redshift . with noise",

    "the solid line is for the theoretical result from eq .",
    "( 31 ) , and the histograms are for the result from the @xmath141 monte carlo simulations . for each simulation",
    ", we identify the highest peak within the region @xmath191 to be the one corresponding to the main cluster .",
    "the true cluster mass distribution is considered without additional treatments for the mass - sheet degeneracy .",
    "firstly , it is seen that the solid line is in very good agreement with the results from simulations , showing that eq.(31 ) can properly model the effects of noise on the measured height of the main - cluster peak .",
    "secondly , it is noted that the average value of the measured peak height is shifted toward larger @xmath7 with respect to the true height of the cluster ( indicated by the vertical dotted line in each panel ) .",
    "the specific value of the shift depends sensitively on the density profile of the cluster . for the isothermal cluster ,",
    "the shift is about @xmath198 from @xmath6 of the true peak height to @xmath199 , whereas for the nfw cluster , the shift is smaller with @xmath200 .",
    "this systematic shift due to the existence of noise is closely related to the fact that the differential peak number distribution of a pure gaussian noise field ( considering only maxima peaks ) is peaked at @xmath201 , rather than at @xmath202 .",
    "such a positive shift can increase the number of weak - lensing cluster detections , and thus affect the corresponding cosmological applications considerably . in the next subsection , we present a detailed model to calculate quantitatively the expected number of weak - lensing convergence peaks , true or false , from a large - scale weak lensing survey , taking into account such a shift and the enhancement of the noise peaks around clusters of galaxies .",
    "this model allows us to be able to use directly the high peaks detected in a large - scale weak - lensing convergence map as cosmological probes without the need of expensive follow - up observations to differentiate true and false peaks .",
    "the existence of noise also results a spatial offset for the identified main - cluster - peak from the true central position of the cluster .",
    "this can be understood as follows . without noise ,",
    "the main - cluster - peak in the weak lensing convergence map locates exactly at the cluster center @xmath203 in our considered cases of spherical clusters . at this spatial location , the conditions @xmath204 @xmath205 are satisfied . with noise , however , the location of a peak should satisfy necessarily the conditions @xmath206 @xmath205 , rather than @xmath204 @xmath205 . given a realization of a noise field n and considering a small offset @xmath207 @xmath205",
    ", the original central peak now shifts to a location which can be estimated by @xmath208 @xmath209 , where we have used @xmath210 .",
    "thus the offset distribution depends on the distribution of @xmath211 , which , in the considered gaussian case , is characterized by @xmath53 defined in eq .",

    "for the isothermal case , the offset distribution is peaked around @xmath229 , and for the nfw case , it is peaked at @xmath230 .",
    "the relatively flat density distribution of the cored isothermal cluster can therefore lead to an offset of order of @xmath1 for the main - cluster - peak identified from weak - lensing analyses .",

    "for the nfw cluster with @xmath138 , the central region is cleaner than that of the isothermal case , and contains on average @xmath8 peaks with @xmath299 . in outside regions around a cluster with @xmath300 ,",
    "high noise peaks can be confused with @xmath45dark clumps@xmath45 , and thus lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the structure formation .",
    "we find that depending on the density profile of a cluster , the average number of high noise peaks in the regions @xmath301 can be significantly enhanced .",
    "this is locally due to the quantity @xmath302 mainly .",
    "but it is important to realize that the @xmath144-dependence , i.e. , the profile of @xmath302 , plays key roles resulting a net overall enhancement in the considered outside region , especially when the mass - sheet degeneracy is taken into consideration . for the cored isothermal cluster , the enhancement factor @xmath11 ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13 for the number of peaks with @xmath10 , depending on the treatment of the mass - sheet degeneracy . for @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath11 is in the range of @xmath303 . for the nfw cluster ,",
    "the enhancement is weaker than that of the isothermal cluster for high peaks , with @xmath304 for @xmath10 , and @xmath305 for @xmath4 .",
    "this enhancement is important in analyzing the statistical significance of @xmath45dark clump@xmath45 occurrence near clusters of galaxies .",
    "taking into account the effects of noise on the main - cluster - peak heights and the enhancement of the number of noise peaks near dark matter halos , we propose a model incorporating the mass function of dark matter halos to calculate the statistical abundance of convergence peaks over large scales .",
    "the model prediction is in good agreement with that from numerical simulations .",
    "it should be pointed out that because of the mutual effects of the mass distribution of dark matter halos and noise , the noise peak abundance also carries important cosmological information , especially the information related to the density profile of dark matter halos .",
    "our model then provides a theoretical framework to use statistically the total number of convergence peaks , including the false ones from noise , as cosmological probes .",
    "this facilitates the cosmological applications of weak - lensing peak statistics in saving the expensive follow - up observations to distinguish true and false peaks .",
    "furthermore , the useful cosmological information contained in the noise peak distribution is also included .    concerning high peaks with @xmath306",
    ", our model can predict the total convergence peaks very well because most of the high peaks are associated with massive virialized dark matter halos ( and the noise peaks around them ) .",
    "for relatively low peaks , the projection effects of large - scale structures can be important , which can change the peak height of clusters as well as produce their own convergence peaks without being associated with virialized clusters ( e.g. , tang & fan 2005 ; marian et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; maturi et al .",
    "2009 ) . to a certain extent",
    ", the total weak - lensing convergence can be written as @xmath307 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the respective contributions from virialized dark matter halos and the noise as discussed in this paper , and @xmath263 denotes the large - scale structure contribution beyond dark matter halos .",
    "on very large scales where density perturbations are approximately linear , the effects of large - scale structures can be described by a gaussian random field reasonably well ( maturi et al .",
    "2009 ) . under this gaussian assumption , our current model on peak distribution near clusters of galaxies can be extended to include the effects of large - scale structures by analyzing the sum of the two gaussian random fields @xmath308 , which is also gaussian , while treating the cluster @xmath39 as a background",
    ". then eq .",
    "( 35 ) to eq .",
    "( 38 ) can be used to study large scale peak statistics , in which the gaussian field @xmath40 is replaced with the total gaussian field @xmath308 .",
    "it should be pointed out that physical correlations between @xmath39 and @xmath263 can exist , which may complicate the analyses considerably .",
    "the above approach essentially divides the structures into two parts , virialized dark matter halos , and linear large - scale perturbations described by a gaussian random field . on scales in between where nonlinear effects are significant and the gaussian approximation of @xmath263 is not appropriate , the modeling on @xmath263 deserves careful investigations .",
    "a possible way to study them is to extend the mass function of dark matter halos to include such nonlinear but non - virialized structures .",
    "detailed investigations on the projection effects of large - scale structures , both linear and nonlinear , will be performed as one of our main future tasks .",
    "weak lensing effects hold great potentials in cosmological studies . with thorough investigations on different systematics",
    ", we expect that future weak - lensing observations would bring us a greatly improved understanding about the dark side of the universe .",
    "we sincerely thank the referee for the comments and suggestions , which help to improve the paper considerably .",

    "<S> taking into account noise from intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies , in this paper , we study the peak statistics in weak - lensing convergence maps around clusters of galaxies and beyond . </S>",

    "<S> the offset distribution is very broad and extends to @xmath18 for the isothermal case . for the nfw cluster </S>",
    "<S> , it is relatively narrow and peaked at @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze nfw clusters of different concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the more centrally concentrated the mass distribution of a cluster is , the less its weak - lensing signal is affected by noise . incorporating these important effects and the mass function of nfw dark matter halos , we further present a model calculating the statistical abundances of total convergence peaks , true and false ones , over a large field beyond individual clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in good agreement with those from numerical simulations . </S>",
