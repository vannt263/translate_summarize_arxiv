    "we extend our search for a parity - flavor - breaking phase in simulations of dynamical qcd with two flavors of light wilson fermions to the strong coupling region of @xmath2 less than 5.0 .",
    "the signature used in this search is the same used in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "we introduce an explicit breaking term into the action with a small coefficient and then study the finite size behavior of its expectation value as this coefficient tends to zero .",
    "we report here on simulations done with two flavors of wilson fermions at @xmath8 and @xmath9 on volumes of @xmath0 , and up to @xmath1 for a variety of values of @xmath3 ranging from less than the appropriate @xmath7 to values greater than @xmath7 .",
    "some of these simulations ( denoted by the letter @xmath10 in the tables ) are continuing and simulations at @xmath11 are in progress .",
    "we introduce into the qcd action a term of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a @xmath14 matrix representing the third element of the generators of flavor su(2 ) algebra . upon integrating the fermionic variables this",
    "is reflected in the simulation by the product of two determinants : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is given by a simple modification of the wilson matrix @xmath17 as : @xmath18 as pointed out by aoki @xcite , we also have here @xmath19 and : @xmath20    simulations were done for the parameter @xmath4 taking values ranging from 0.005 to 0.1 . for the volume dependence we concentrate on the smaller values of @xmath4 and in particular @xmath21 for all three volumes considered and mostly for values of @xmath3 greater than @xmath7 .",
    "the order parameter we compute is the expectation value of the operator @xmath22 . with our notation",
    "this is given as    @xmath23",
    "for the values of @xmath2 considered , simulations were performed , as mentioned above , at various values of @xmath3 both below and above @xmath7 .",
    "we shall present the data and results for each value of @xmath2 considered separately .",
    "the results are shown in tables  14 .",
    ".parameters and measured order parameter @xmath24 for the case of @xmath25 on lattices of volume @xmath26 , for @xmath27,@xmath28 , and @xmath29.[tabbeta3.0 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is clear that if one concentrates on the behavior with volume of the simulations at @xmath30 , one may quickly note that a signature for the parity - flavor - breaking phase is indicated for the following values of @xmath31 and @xmath3 : ( 3.0 , 0.25 ) , ( 3.5 , 0.24 ) , ( 3.7 , 0.24 ) and ( 4.0 , 0.24 ) . see fig .  [ pfhisto ] for the latter two points .",
    "this is also confirmed by following the behavior of the order parameter as a function of @xmath3 at constant volume and constant @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear that all values above the order parameter goes through a relative maximum .",
    "the behavior of the order parameter at all other values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , computed in tables  14 , are consistent with an absence for a signature of a parity - flavor - breaking phase .",
    "this behavior is in fact very similar to the behavior for values of @xmath32 which were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to note here that the phase is not indicated for some points at the same @xmath2 but larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "in particular the phase disappears at ( 3.5 , 0.25 ) , at ( 3.7 , 0.25 ) .",
    "it is clear from the discussion above that qcd with two flavors of wilson fermions does exhibit a parity - flavor - breaking phase at values of @xmath2 up to 4.0 , as postulated by aoki and collaborators .",
    "it has also been demonstrated in  @xcite that this phase does not seem to extend beyond @xmath33 .",
    "this information is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ parphase ] .",
    "it is then possible that this phase pinches out , in a manner similar to that in the njl model , at @xmath34 . in this case",
    ", this phase would not be relevant for the discussion of the approach to the chiral limit in qcd and the ensuing goldstone nature of the pions for @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , all indications are such that , as shown formally sometime ago , this is simply related to the approach to zero lattice spacing and infinite volume .",
    "i wish to thank urs heller and robert edwards for providing a modified qcd code for performing the simulations reported in this paper .",
    "all these simulations were done on the scri ibm compute cluster ."
