    "the study of out - of - equilibrium quantum systems has received quite a lot of attention in recent years and many effords have been devoted to understand properties of thermalization or relaxation towards equilibrium in the quantum regime @xcite , transport @xcite , dynamical phase transitions @xcite , ergodic and non - ergodic quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the quickly developing field of ultracold atomic gases offers the possibility of manipulating and controlling complex quantum systems with very high accuracy .",
    "this tunability has undoubtedly increased the interest in studying the dynamics in such systems due to the possibility of experimentally testing theoretical predicitons and offering new research perspectives @xcite .",
    "the bose - hubbard model is one of the most studied systems in this context , because of its rich phase diagram @xcite and because it describes faithfully the dynamics of ultracold atomic bosons in otpical lattices @xcite , therefore , relevant for experimental investigations . in order to theoretically study the bhm",
    "generally one can resort to the following numerical tools : exact numerical diagonalization @xcite and time dependent density matrix renormalization group ( t - dmrg ) approach @xcite .",
    "a very powerful method for non - equilibrium systems is the keldysh - green s functional approach developed to describe the dynamics of a quantum system without the assumption that the system relaxes towards a steady state @xcite .",
    "this technique can be formulated either in the form of equations of motion for the single - particle green s function or as a many - body perturbation approach , eventually resumming some of the diagrams appearing in the series . for the single particle green s function , and for a two - body interaction hamiltonian",
    ", it is possible to define a closed set of equations , whose iterative solution is the solution to the initial problem @xcite .",
    "this set of equations has been named after hedin the hedin s equations .",
    "the iterative solution of such equations is obviously performed numerically .",
    "hedin s equations are nevertheless difficult to be implemented because of the appearance of a functional derivative in the equation for the vertex function .",
    "one would thus need to find a way to calculate it analytically at different orders and then insert it into the numerical code .",
    "this process is nevertheless rather complicated and often the way out is to drop this equation thus effectively keeping the bare vertex through the iterations @xcite .",
    "however it is possible to recast hedin s equations in a different , but equivalent , set of equations as shown by starke and kresse in their work @xcite .",
    "the idea behind is to exploit the fact that , for a two - body interaction hamiltonian , the equation of motion for the interacting single - particle green s function is related to the two - body green s function .",
    "it is then possible to write a set of equation and simultaneously find the iterative solutions for both .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : selfmeth ] we describe the self consistent methods and discuss their properties , limitation and potentiality , in sec . [ sec : bhm ] we introduce the perturbative theory used to study the dynamics of the weakly interacting bose hubbard model ( bhm ) , whereas in sec .",
    "[ sec : selfcons ] we describe the corresponding iterative scheme used to find the time - dependent single particle green s functions and its relation to the previously introduced schemes . finally , in secs .",
    "[ sec:1d ] and [ sec:2d ] we present a study of quenches in one and two dimensional bhm for different paramenters of the system such as initial chemical potential , final interaction , temperature , and dimensionality .",
    "in this section we briefly review self - consistent methods which allow one to calculate the single particle green s function for an interacting many - body system with a two - body interaction . in order to fix the ideas we will consider from now a bosonic system described by the hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are bosonic field operators satisfying commutation relations @xmath3=-\\imath\\hbar\\delta({\\bf",
    "x}-{\\bf x'})\\delta(t - t')$ ] and @xmath4=0 $ ] .",
    "we defined @xmath5 and allowed for an explicit time dependence of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "most of the interesting information about the system can be extracted from the knowledge of the single particle green s function defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the ( properly chosen ) keldysh contour @xcite and @xmath8 is the time ordering over @xmath7 and we used the standard notation for variables , namely @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 being the complex time variable on the contour . by properly choosing the contour @xmath7 different approaches can be recovered  @xcite : for instance by choosing the contour to run only along the imaginary axis the matsubara approach for the treatment of the thermodynamics of interacting systems is obtained .",
    "we will focus on a contour which goes around the real line running from @xmath12 to @xmath13 @xmath14 crossing the real line at @xmath15 , namely the maximum evolution time .    as clearly described in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to find the green s function one can resort to two different , but equivalent approaches .",
    "the first uses the heisenberg equations for the field operators to find an equation of motion for the green s function .",
    "this method results in a hierarchy of equations , the martin - swinger hierarchy , in which green s function of different orders are linked to each other . in our case ( two body interaction hamiltonian )",
    "the hierarchy links the time derivative of the @xmath16body green s function to the @xmath17body green s function . so that the single particle green s functions is related to the two - body one .",
    "the second approach is based on the gell - mann low theorem , allowing the cancellation of disconnected diagrams ( linked cluster expansion ) , in order to calculate the green s function perturbatively by including the wanted set of diagrams depending on the system at hand .",
    "this technique is particularly powerful because it allows us to take into account the chosen diagrams to all order in the coupling constant , thus representing an evolution of simple perturbative approach . here",
    "we will follow this second approach .    in this case",
    "it is possible to derive a closed set of equations , the hedin s equations , whose ( iterative ) solution gives the interacting single - particle green s function : @xmath18(1;2)+\\sigma_{ex}[g , w](1;2)\\\\   \\label{eq : selfen }   & & p(1;2)=\\imath \\int d\\overline{1 } d\\overline{2}\\ ; g(1;\\overline 1 ) g(\\overline 2;1^+ ) \\lambda(\\overline 1;\\overline 2;2)\\\\   \\label{eq : pol }   & & w(1;2)=u(1;2)+\\!\\!\\int\\!\\ ! d\\overline{1 }",

    "these equations are : the dyson equation for the single particle green s function ; the equation for the self - energy where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the hartree and exchange self - energy respectively ; the equation for the polarization ; the equation for the dressed interaction ; the equation for the vertex function .",
    "all these equations have to be solved iteratively with properly chosen seeds for the iterative scheme ; for instance the initial single particle green s function is often the non - interacting one or the self - consistent hartree green s function .",
    "nevertheless in trying to iteratively solve hedin s equations different problems arise .",
    "the most difficult one is related to the fact that the equation for the vertex function contains a functional derivative of the ( exchange ) self - energy with respect to the interacting single particle green s function .",
    "this fact makes the numerical implementation particularly difficult .",
    "schindlmayr and godby  @xcite have obtained an analytical expression for the vertex function after the first iteration step for the fermi - hubbard model . nevertheless hedin s approach in its generality still suffers from this problem and in most cases of interest implementing such a scheme is so complicated that other options are usually prefered .",
    "recently starke and kresse used a slightly different point of view in the derivation of a self - consistent set of equations @xcite .",
    "they observed that , as mentioned above , the single - particle green s functions , for a two - body interaction hamiltonian , is related to the two particle one .",
    "they derived a set of two equations which is equivalent to hedin s equations : @xmath22 where @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the interacting two - particle green s function .",
    "the two equations are : 1 ) an equation for the interacting single - particle green s function ( analogous to the dyson equation , eq .",
    "[ eq : dyson ] ) ; 2 ) the bethe - salpeter equation for the exchange part of the interacting two - particle green s functions .",
    "this set of equations does not rely on any functional derivative , but it fixes _ a priori _ the kernel @xmath25 of the bethe - salpeter equation , namely the two - particle scattering amplitude , which on the other hand can be upgraded at every iteration depending on the choice of both @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the latter is in general a functional of the _ interacting _ single particle green s function as well . depending on the choice of @xmath25 and @xmath26 it is possible to obtain different schemes , including the most used in literature such as the hartree - fock approximation , the random - phase approximation , the gw - approximation , the ladder approximation and the w - approximation ( see table i in ref .",
    "@xcite for the hierarchy of approximation for different choices of the kernel @xmath25 ) .    in the following",
    "we will introduce our approach closely related to the one derived by starke and kresse to find self - consistently the one- and two - particle green s functions for the weakly interacting bose - hubbard model .",
    "the bose hubbard model ( bhm ) is obtained as the tight binding limit of the hamiltonian in eq.[eq : fieldham ] where the potential is chosen to have several local minima . in this limit",
    "we can choose a basis of wavefunctions localized around the local minima of the potential and write the field operator as @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian thus reads @xmath28 the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 obey bosonic commutation relations : @xmath31=\\delta_{i , j}$ ] and @xmath32=0 $ ] . to fix the ideas we will think of interacting bosonic atoms in an optical lattice for which the bhm has been proven to give a very good description @xcite . in what follows",
    "we shall consider the weakly interacting limit @xmath33 and resort to a perturbative expansion of the single particle interacting green s functions .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath34 \\right\\rangle } { \\left\\langle \\mathcal{t}_\\gamma\\left [ e^{-\\imath\\int_{\\gamma}dz { \\hat{v}_{i}^{}(z)}}\\right]\\right\\rangle } , \\label{eq : onebodyg}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture and the multi - index is now @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the site index and @xmath38 the complex time on the contour . in order to calculate @xmath39 we resort to its expansion in terms of the non - interacting green s functions @xmath40 .",
    "in particular we use the so called ladder approximation , which amounts to calculate the self - energy entering the dyson equation by means of a two - particle scattering amplitude which in turn is calculated from the bethe - salpeter equation . for the interaction term as in eq.[eq : totham ] , @xmath41 can be approximated to second order by expanding the evolution operator .",
    "assuming the initial state is such that the non - interacting @xmath42-particle green s functions can be written as a permanent of the non - interacting single - particle ones the denominator in eq .",
    "[ eq : onebodyg ] cancles all disconnected diagrams in the expansion thus leaving only connected ones @xcite .",
    "in order to construct our iterative method let us look at the first and second order ( connected ) contributions which are given by : @xmath43 in the second order we considered only the two - particle irreducible contributions , _",
    "i.e. _ those with no self - energy insertions , the reason will become clear in the following .",
    "the factor two comes from the fact that direct and exchange integrals give the same contribution due to the on - site interaction and to the lack of any other label but the site index .",
    "the above terms can be recovered from the dyson equation for the interacting single - particle green s function with the definition of a self - energy .",
    "we are going to define it by means of a vertex function which is in turn recovered from the bethe - salpeter equation whose kernel we chose to be the bare interaction : @xmath44 where in our case @xmath45 and @xmath46 and we assumed an interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath47 .",
    "we then define the self - energy as @xmath48 this is known as the ladder approximation from the form of feynman diagrams at different orders for the two - particle scattering amplitude @xmath49 . in the case of interacting electrons the ladder approximation is associated to the low density limit and it is physically justified because the contribution of particle - hole like excitation is of higher order ( in the interaction ) with respect to particle - particle scattering in this limit @xcite .",
    "the definition of a self - energy allows us to write the dyson equation for the interacting sing particle green s function : @xmath50",
    "we have seen that through the definition of a ( proper ) self - energy it is possible to write a dyson equation for the interacting single particle green s function .",
    "nevertheless the self - energy defined above does not allow one to recover many important contributions , in particular those which are two - particle lines reducible .",
    "this is because the two - particle scattering amplitude @xmath49 , and therefore the self - energy @xmath51 derived from it , does not contain such diagrams by construction .",
    "for instance , the following second order contribution can not be obtained from the dyson equation with the self - energy defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmabs ] ) , @xmath52",
    ". the above second order term can be accounted by using the hartree green s function in the dyson equation instead of the non - interacting one .",
    "nevertheless there are higher order contributions which can not be derived by means of the hartree propagator and the ladder approximation and they would require more complex self - energies to be defined . to get around this problem we resort to iterations by means of the following iterative scheme :    @xmath53    with initial seed @xmath54 the non - interacting green s functions and @xmath42 being the iteration step . in the above equations we split the time and the site indeces , which will turn useful when rewriting the equation for the different components on the contour ( see appendix [ app : realtime ] ) .",
    "this is nothing but a subset of the most general system of equation , namely the hedin s equations .",
    "it is possible to show that the above set of equations is equivalent to the one in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : greensk ] ) with the choice @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the difference between our approach and the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite relies on the fact that instead of working with the two - particle green s functions ( namely @xmath57 ) we use the two - particle scattering amplitude ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the latter is a tensor which is partially diagonal ( [ app : realtime ] ) and can thus be implemented as a matrix in the numerical simulations .",
    "the two particle green s function requires four ( spatial ) indexes in general and it would be more costly in terms of computational resourses .    in order to make the above system of equations suitable for numerical implementation , each equation has to be decomposed into the corresponding equations with real time arguments which can be done by means of langreth theorem .",
    "the result is the set of equations presented in appendix [ app : realtime ] .",
    "the numerical implementation is then performed by means of two fortran 90 codes , the first of which solves the non - interacting problem relative to @xmath58 and passes the non - interacting green s functions @xmath59 to the second code which then implements the above iterative scheme .",
    "the first code uses openmp to speed up the computation of the non - interacting green s function .",
    "the second code uses mpi parallelization by means of the scalapack libraries on a grid of ( usually ) @xmath60 processes .    in what follows",
    "we will use the iterative scheme in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : itk])-([eq : itdyson ] ) to study the dynamics of one- and two - dimensional bose - hubbard model following the switching on of the boson - boson interaction @xmath61 .",
    "in this section we exploit the presented approach to study the dynamics of the bhm following a quench in the boson - boson interaction for a 1d bhm . in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have shown that the speed of propagation of correlations depends upon the spectrum of the final hamiltonian .",
    "specifically the speed increases by increasing the boson - boson interaction as suggested by the dispersion relation of excitations in the bogoliubov theory in the presence of repulsive interaction .",
    "our analysis was limited to small interaction and relied on the bogoliubov approach , thus giving an effectively non - interacting theory .",
    "this is why we could access the ballistic regime only .",
    "however it is expected that by increasing the boson - boson interaction the system eventually enters a diffusive regime due to the non - linearity introduced by interactions ; this behavior has also been confirmed experimentally @xcite .",

    "<S> we present a non - equilibrium green s functional approach to study the dynamics following a quench in weakly interacting bose hubbard model ( bhm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is based on the self - consistent solution of a set of equations which represents a particular case of the most general set of hedin s equations for the interacting single - particle green s function . </S>",
    "<S> we use the ladder approximation as a skeleton diagram for the two - particle scattering amplitude useful , through the self - energy in the dyson equation , for finding the interacting single - particle green s function . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme is then implemented numerically by a parallelized code . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit this approach to study the correlation propagation after a quench in the interaction parameter , for one ( 1d ) and two ( 2d ) dimensions . in particular , we show how our approach is able to recover the crossover from ballistic to diffusive regime by increasing the boson - boson interaction . finally we also discuss the role of a thermal initial state on the dynamics both for 1d and 2d bose hubbard models , finding that surprisingly at high temperature a ballistic evolution is restored . </S>"
