    "there has been considerable interest recently in sasaki  einstein geometry . recall that a sasaki  einstein manifold @xmath6 is a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath7 whose metric cone s^2 ( c(y ) ) = r^2 + r^2 s^2 ( y)[metcone]is ricci  flat and khler .",
    "the recent interest has largely arisen due to a new construction of explicit inhomogeneous sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics in all dimensions @xcite .",
    "in particular in dimension @xmath3 there is an infinite family of cohomogeneity one five ",
    "metrics , denoted @xmath5 where @xmath8 are positive integers @xcite . the ads / cft correspondence @xcite conjectures that for a sasaki  einstein five ",
    "manifold @xmath6 , type iib string theory on ads@xmath9 with @xmath10 units of self  dual five  form flux is dual to a four  dimensional @xmath11 superconformal field theory @xcite . this field theory may be thought of as arising from a stack of @xmath10 d3branes sitting at the apex @xmath12 of the corresponding calabi  yau cone ( [ metcone ] ) . following the results of @xcite , for the case",
    "@xmath13 these field theories were constructed in @xcite thus furnishing a countably infinite set of ads / cft duals where both sides of the duality are known explicitly .",
    "recall that all sasaki  einstein manifolds @xmath6 have a canonically defined constant norm killing vector field @xmath14 , called the reeb vector . in the case",
    "@xmath3 this is ads / cft dual to the r  symmetry of the dual superconformal field theory .",
    "the transverse geometry to the corresponding foliation of @xmath6 is always khler  einstein of positive curvature . in the case that the leaves of the foliation are all compact one has a @xmath15 action on @xmath6 . if this action is free the sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold is said to be regular , and is the total space of a @xmath15 principle bundle over a positive curvature khler  einstein manifold .",
    "more generally the @xmath15 action is only locally free and one instead has a @xmath15 orbibundle over a positive curvature khler ",
    "einstein orbifold .",
    "such structures are referred to as quasi  regular .",
    "if the generic orbits of @xmath14 do not close there is only a transverse khler  einstein structure and these are the irregular geometries .    in dimension five , regular sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics are classified completely  @xcite .",
    "this follows since the smooth four  dimensional khler ",
    "einstein metrics with positive curvature on the base have been classified by tian and yau @xcite .",
    "these include the special cases @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with corresponding sasaki  einstein manifolds being the homogeneous manifolds @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) , respectively .",
    "for the remaining metrics the base is a del pezzo surface obtained by blowing up @xmath16 at @xmath22 generic points with @xmath23 and , although proven to exist , the general metrics are not known in explicit form . in the last few years , starting with the work of boyer and galicki @xcite , quasi ",
    "regular sasaki ",
    "einstein metrics have been shown to exist on @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the irregular case is perhaps more interesting since so little is known about these geometries  the @xmath5 metrics @xcite and their higher dimensional generalisations @xcite are the very first examples . indeed , these are counterexamples to the conjecture of cheeger and tian @xcite that irregular sasaki  einstein manifolds do not exist .    for an irregular metric",
    "the closure of the orbits of @xmath14 is at least a two  torus , meaning that the metric must possess at least a @xmath26 group of isometries . in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to toric sasaki  einstein manifolds . by definition",
    "this means that the isometry group contains at least an @xmath0torus .",
    "there are good mathematical and physical reasons for imposing toricity . on the mathematical side ,",
    "as we shall see , the subject of toric sasakian manifolds is simple enough that one can prove many general results without too much effort . on the physical side , for @xmath3 , a toric sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold is dual to a _ toric quiver gauge theory_. these theories have a rich structure , but again are simple enough that one has considerable analytic control .    given a sasaki  einstein five ",
    "manifold @xmath6 , the problem of constructing the dual field theory is in general a difficult one .",
    "however , provided the isometry group of @xmath6 is large enough one can typically make progress using a variety of physical and mathematical arguments . in particular , if @xmath6 is toric in principle there is an algorithm which constructs the gauge theory from the toric data of the calabi  yau singularity @xcite .",
    "thus in this case both the geometry and the gauge theory are specified by a set of combinatoral data . on physical grounds ,",
    "this theory is expected to flow at low energies to a superconformal fixed point , and in particular the global symmetry group of this theory contains a canonical `` @xmath27 '' factor , which is the r  symmetry .",
    "if this symmetry is correctly identified , many properties of the gauge theory may be determined . a general procedure that determines this symmetry is @xmath4maximisation @xcite .",
    "roughly , one can define a function @xmath4 on an appropriate space of admissable r  symmetries which depends only on the combinatorial data that specifies the quiver gauge theory , and thus in principle only on the toric data of the singularity .",
    "the local maximum of this function precisely determines the r  symmetry of the theory at its superconformal point . from the r  charges one can then use the ads / cft correspondence to compute the volume of the dual sasaki  einstein manifold , as well as the volumes of certain supersymmetric 3dimensional submanifolds .",
    "remarkable agreement was found for these two computations in the case of the @xmath28 metric @xcite , and the @xmath4maximisation calculation @xcite for the quiver gauge theory corresponding to the first del pezzo surface @xcite .",
    "the field theories for the remaining @xmath5 family were constructed in @xcite and again perfect agreement was found for the two computations .    to summarise , @xmath4maximisation and the ads / cft correspondence imply that the volumes of toric sasaki ",
    "einstein manifolds , as well as certain submanifolds , should somehow be extractable from the toric data of the calabi  yau singularity in a relatively simple manner , without actually finding the metric .",
    "in both the regular and quasi ",
    "regular cases this follows from the fact that , in these cases , one can view the sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold as a @xmath15 ( orbi)bundle over a khler ",
    "einstein manifold ( respectively orbifold ) , where the @xmath15 is generated by the reeb vector .",
    "the problem of computing the volume , as well as the volumes of certain supersymmetric submanifolds , is then reduced to that of computing the volumes of the khler ",
    "einstein base and its divisors , respectively , which is a purely topological question , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "these are then clearly _ rational _ multiples of the volumes of the round five  sphere and three  sphere , respectively . however , in some sense the generic case is the irregular case and here one can not reduce the computation to that of computing topological invariants . in this paper we show that one can determine the reeb vector of any toric sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold in a simple way , without finding the metric , and from this one can compute the volumes referred to above .",
    "we therefore interpret this as being a geometric `` dual '' to @xmath4maximisation .",
    "in this section we describe the khler geometry of toric varieties , focusing on the special case of a khler cone .",
    "the general formalism is due to guillemin @xcite and abreu @xcite and has been used recently in donaldson s work @xcite on constant scalar curvature metrics . here",
    "we focus on the case where the khler toric variety is a cone over a real manifold , which by definition is a sasakian manifold .",
    "the torus action fibres this khler cone over a rational polyhedral cone @xmath29 via the moment map .",
    "any toric khler metric may be written in terms of a symplectic potential , which is the legendre transform of the khler potential , and in the special case of a cone we show that the moduli space of such symplectic potentials , for fixed toric variety , splits as = ^*_0(1)[bob]where @xmath30 , the space of reeb vectors , is the interior of the dual cone to @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the space of smooth homogeneous degree one functions on @xmath31 ( subject to a convexity condition ) .",
    "we also write down a monge  ampre equation in this formalism which imposes that the sasakian metric is also einstein .",
    "regularity of a solution to this equation then imposes a condition on the reeb vector @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath33 be a khler cone of complex dimension @xmath0 .",
    "this means that @xmath34 has metric s^2(x ) = r^2 + r^2 s^2(y )  .we take @xmath35 so that @xmath36 is a smooth manifold which is incomplete at @xmath12 .",
    "the condition that this metric be khler is then equivalent to @xmath37 being sasakian  in fact this is probably the most useful definition of sasakian .",
    "we then have _ r / r = 2which says that the khler form @xmath38 is homogeneous degree 2 under the euler vector @xmath39 .",
    "it follows that @xmath38 is exact : = -(r^2)where @xmath40 may be considered as a global one ",
    "form on @xmath37 .    from this definition",
    "it is straightforward to show that the reeb vector field k(r)[killbill]is a killing vector field , where @xmath41 denotes the complex structure on @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath14 is dual to the one ",
    "form @xmath42 , as follows simply from the above definitions .",
    "thus equivalently we have = ( )  .it terms of the @xmath43 operator on @xmath36 we thus have = i(-|)rso that = -2i    thus we see that @xmath44 is a khler potential .",
    "we now impose in addition that @xmath33 is toric .",
    "this means that the real torus @xmath45 acts effectively on @xmath36 , preserving the khler form , which we regard as a symplectic form .",
    "moreover one also requires that the torus action is integrable , meaning that one can introduce a moment map @xmath46 .",
    "the moment map allows one to introduce symplectic coordinates on @xmath2 y_i = -<r^2,>where @xmath47 generate the @xmath45 action .",
    "thus @xmath48 are angular coordinates along the orbits of the torus action , with @xmath49 .",
    "we may then use @xmath50 as symplectic coordinates on @xmath36 .",
    "let us also assume , cones over principle @xmath51 bundles over @xmath52 , or cones over products @xmath53",
    ", @xmath54 @xcite . ] that @xmath36 is of reeb type .",
    "this means that there is some @xmath55 such that @xmath56 is a strictly positive function on @xmath36 .",
    "the moment map then exhibits the khler cone as a lagrangian torus fibration over a strictly convex rational polyhedral cone @xmath57 by forgetting the angular coordinates @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "this image is a subset of @xmath2 of the form [ conehead ] = \\{y^nl_a(y)0 , a=1, ",
    ",d}where we have introduced the linear function l_a(y)=(y , v_a)with euclidean metric @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the inward pointing normal vectors to the @xmath60 facets of the polyhedral cone .",
    "these normals are rational and hence one can normalise them to be primitive is primitive if it can not be written as @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 . ]",
    "elements of @xmath64 .",
    "we also assume this set of vectors is minimal in the sense that removing any vector @xmath59 in the definition ( [ conehead ] ) changes @xmath31 .",
    "the condition that @xmath31 be strictly convex is simply the condition that it is a cone over a convex polytope .",
    "there is an additional condition on the @xmath65 for @xmath6 a smooth manifold , and the cone is then said to be _ good _ @xcite .",
    "this may be defined as follows .",
    "each face @xmath66 may be realised uniquely as the intersection of some number of facets @xmath67 .",
    "denote by @xmath68 the corresponding collection of normal vectors in @xmath65 , where @xmath10 is the codimension of @xmath69  thus @xmath70 is a subset of @xmath71 .",
    "then the cone is good if and only if [ good ] \\{_a=1^n _ a v_a_a_a}^n = \\{_a=1^n _ a v_a_a_a}for all faces @xmath69 .",
    "the torus fibration is non  degenerate over the interior @xmath72 of @xmath31 .",
    "thus the @xmath45 action is free on the corresponding subset @xmath73 of @xmath36 .",
    "the boundary @xmath74 of the polyhedral cone then effectively describes @xmath36 as a compactification of @xmath75 .",
    "specifically , the normal vector @xmath76 to a facet @xmath67 determines a one  cycle in @xmath45 and this cycle collapses over the facet .",
    "thus each facet corresponds to a toric symplectic subspace of @xmath36 of real codimension two . similarly lower ",
    "dimensional faces of the cone correspond to higher codimension toric symplectic subspaces .",
    "the condition that the cone is good then amounts to requiring that this compactification gives a cone over a smooth manifold @xmath6 .",
    "the symplectic ( khler ) form is = y_i_iwhere here and henceforth we adopt the einstein summation convention for the indices @xmath77 .",
    "as described in @xcite , any @xmath45invariant khler metric on @xmath36 is then of the form [ symplecticmetric ] s^2 = g_ij y_iy_j + g^ij_i_jwhere @xmath78 is the inverse matrix to @xmath79 .",
    "the almost complex structure is then clearly [ complex ] = in the basis @xmath50 and it is straightforward to verify that integrability of @xmath41 requires @xmath80 and hence g_ij = g_,ijfor some strictly convex function @xmath81 .",
    "we refer to @xmath82 as the symplectic potential for the khler metric",
    ". it should be clear that the metric ( [ symplecticmetric ] ) is a cone if and only if the matrix @xmath83 is homogeneous degree @xmath84 in @xmath85 .",
    "the introduction of the symplectic potential @xmath86 above may seem slightly mysterious , but in fact it is related to the more usual khler potential by legendre transform . in fact",
    "the two viewpoints may be neatly summarised as follows . in the complex viewpoint",
    "one keeps the complex structure of @xmath36 fixed and considers the khler form , and hence khler potential , to vary , whereas in the symplectic viewpoint one keeps the symplectic form fixed and varies the complex structure ( [ complex ] ) .",
    "usually this latter approach is not particularly useful in khler geometry .",
    "however in toric khler geometry this formalism has already been used with great success , for example in donaldson s work @xcite on constant scalar curvature metrics .",
    "this will also be the case for toric sasakian metrics .    in the complex point of view one",
    "regards @xmath36 as a complex algebraic variety coming equipped with a biholomorphic action of the complex torus @xmath87 which has a dense open orbit @xmath88 which we identify with @xmath88 above .",
    "we introduce standard complex coordinates @xmath89 on @xmath90 .",
    "the real torus @xmath91 then acts by translation in the imaginary direction for the log complex coordinates @xmath92 .",
    "the khler form @xmath38 may then be written as = 2i|fwhere @xmath93 is the khler potential .",
    "here we have again assumed that the metric is invariant under the @xmath45 symmetry .",
    "we also note that @xmath94 is a strictly convex function of the variables @xmath95 . in these",
    "coordinates the metric is s^2 = f_ijx_ix_j + f_ij_i _ jwhere f_ij=  .it follows that f_ij(x ) = g^ij(y = f / x)and the moment map is then clearly = y = by definition .",
    "it hence follows that the symplectic and khler potentials are related by legendre transform f(x ) = ( y_i -g)(y = f / x )  .      given a good strictly convex rational polyhedral cone @xmath29 one can recover the original cone @xmath36 , together with its symplectic structure , via symplectic reduction of @xmath96 .",
    "this follows from a generalisation @xcite of delzant s theorem @xcite .",
    "in fact @xmath36 inherits a natural khler metric from khler reduction of the canonical metric on @xmath96 .",
    "the explicit formula for the symplectic potential of this metric for compact khler toric varieties was first given in a beautiful paper of guillemin @xcite .",
    "the case of singular varieties was studied recently in @xcite .",
    "denote by @xmath97 the span of the normals @xmath65 over @xmath98 .",
    "this is a lattice of maximal rank .",
    "consider the linear map @xmath99 which maps each standard orthonormal basis vector @xmath100 of @xmath101 to the primitive normal vector @xmath59 .",
    "this induces a map of tori ^d^d/2^d ^n/2  .in general the kernel is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a finite abelian group .",
    "then @xmath36 is given by the symplectic quotient x = ^d//  .one can describe this more explicitly as follows .",
    "one computes a primitive basis for the kernel of @xmath104 over @xmath98 by finding all solutions to _ a q_i^a v_a = 0for @xmath105 , and such that for each @xmath106 the @xmath107 have no common factor .",
    "the number of solutions , indexed by @xmath106 , is @xmath108 since @xmath104 is surjective  this latter fact follows since @xmath31 is strictly convex",
    ". then one has [ reduction ] x= /^d - n^d//with \\{(z_1, ",
    ",z_d)^d_aq_i^a |z_a|^2 = 0}^dwhere @xmath109 denote complex coordinates on @xmath96 and the charge matrix @xmath110 specifies the torus @xmath111 .",
    "the quotient group @xmath112 then acts symplectically on @xmath36 and by construction the image of the induced moment map @xmath113 is the polyhedral cone @xmath31 that one began with .",
    "this is proven in @xcite .",
    "now @xmath36 inherits a khler metric from the flat metric on @xmath96 via the reduction ( [ reduction ] ) .",
    "moreover from the latter equation we see that this induced metric is clearly invariant under homothetic rescaling of the @xmath114 and thus this metric will be a conical metric on @xmath36 .",
    "there is an elegant expression for this metric , which in terms of the symplectic potential is given by @xcite g^(y ) = _ a l_a(y)l_a(y )  .we also note the following formulae : = _ a [ 1+l_a(y)]v^a_ig^_ij = _ a v^a_i v^a_j  .in particular note that @xmath115 is homogeneous degree @xmath84 which implies that the corresponding khler metric ( [ symplecticmetric ] ) is a cone .",
    "also notice that @xmath115 has simple poles at each of the @xmath60 facets @xmath116 .",
    "this singular behaviour is required precisely so that the metric on @xmath117 compactifies to a smooth as having its apex deleted . ]",
    "metric on @xmath36 .",
    "as we shall see when we consider the einstein condition for @xmath86 , the metric @xmath118 is never ricci ",
    "flat for @xmath119 .",
    "the case @xmath120 is the case that @xmath36 is locally @xmath121 .",
    "recall that on any khler cone @xmath33 there is a canonically defined killing vector field @xmath14 defined by ( [ killbill ] ) . in particular @xmath14 has norm one at @xmath122 and thus the orbits of @xmath14 on @xmath6 define a foliation of @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to such a sasakian structure as quasi  regular or irregular , depending on whether the generic orbits close or not , respectively . in the irregular case note",
    "that the isometry group is at least @xmath123 , @xmath124 , with the orbits of the killing vector filling out a dense subset of the orbits of the torus action .",
    "indeed , the isometry group of a compact riemannian manifold is always a compact lie group .",
    "hence the orbits of a killing vector field define a one  parameter subgroup , the closure of which will always be an abelian subgroup and thus a torus .",
    "the dimension of the closure of the orbits , @xmath125 , is called the rank .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that the reeb vector always lies in the centre of the lie algebra of the autmorphism group of @xmath6  that is , the group of diffeomorphisms that preserve the sasakian structure . to see this ,",
    "suppose that the vector field @xmath126 generates a symmetry of the khler cone .",
    "this means that @xmath126 commutes with the euler vector @xmath39 and satisfies _",
    "v = 0where @xmath127 denotes the lie derivative .",
    "in particular @xmath126 is an isometry of the metric is @xmath128 but the group which preserves a chosen complex structure is @xmath129 . ] .",
    "we now compute = _ v k = _ v = 0  .hence @xmath14 commutes with @xmath126 for all @xmath126 and so @xmath14 lies in the centre of the automorphism group .    for a toric sasakian manifold",
    "we may write k = b_i [ defreeb]and regard @xmath14 as the vector @xmath130 .",
    "using r = 2 y_ione easily computes that , for a given toric sasakian manifold with symplectic potential @xmath82 , we have b_i = 2g_ij y_j  .it is straightforward to check that @xmath131 is indeed a constant vector . for , b_i = 2y_j g_ij , k + 2g_ik = 2(y_j)g_ik + 2g_ik= 0where we have used euler s theorem and the fact that @xmath132 is homogeneous degree @xmath84 . for the canonical metric one easily computes b^= _ a v^a  .",
    "suppose now that two different symplectic potentials @xmath82 , @xmath133 have the same reeb vector @xmath130 . defining @xmath134",
    "we have [ dude ] ( y_j ) g = 0so that @xmath135 is homogeneous degree 0 for each @xmath136 .",
    "it follows that @xmath137 is homogeneous degree @xmath138 , up to a constant . to see this , note that ( [ dude ] ) implies = 0and hence y_j",
    "g = g + t  .where @xmath139 is a constant .",
    "the constant degree of freedom in @xmath82 is clearly irrelevant .",
    "indeed note that @xmath140 if and only if g=_iy_i+twhere @xmath141 , @xmath139 are constants .",
    "thus the symplectic potential should be thought of as being defined up to a linear function .",
    "conversely , if @xmath142 then the two symplectic potentials @xmath133 and @xmath82 define the same reeb vector and indeed their hessians are homogeneous degree @xmath84 .",
    "let us now define g_b(y ) = l_b(y)l_b(y ) - l_(y ) l_(y )  .where l_b(y ) = ( b , y)and l_(y)= ( b^,y ) = _ a ( v_a , y )  .provided the plane @xmath143 intersects the polyhedral cone @xmath31 to form a finite polytope , this function is a smooth function on @xmath31 .",
    "in fact this condition is that ( b , u _ ) > 0where the @xmath144 are the generating edges of the cone @xmath31 .",
    "indeed note that we may write = \\ { _ _ u_^n_0 }  .this identifies @xmath145 as the dual cone to @xmath31 , which is also a convex rational polyhedral cone by farkas theorem .",

    "moreover at the critical point , @xmath216 and @xmath1 are just the volume of the sasaki ",
    "einstein metric , up to a dimension  dependent factor .",
    "recall now that , starting from a toric calabi  yau singularity in complex dimension three , one can construct a four  dimensional supersymmetric quiver gauge theory arising from a stack of @xmath10 d3branes placed at the singularity , which is expected to flow at low energies to a non  trivial superconformal fixed point .",
    "the higgs branch of this gauge theory is essentially the toric calabi ",
    "yau singularity .",
    "@xmath4maximisation allows one to fix uniquely the exact r  symmetry of this theory at the infra  red fixed point .",
    "this may be formulated as follows .",
    "one first fixes a fiducial r  symmetry @xmath269 which satisfies the constraints imposed by anomaly cancellation .",
    "charge is then allowed to mix with the set of global abelian non ",
    "r symmetries of the theory  by definition the supercharges are invariant under these symmetries .",
    "thus the trial r ",
    "symmetry may be written as @xcite r & = & r_0 + _ i s_i f_iwhere @xmath270 generate the group of abelian symmetries , and @xmath271 .",
    "one can now define a function @xmath4 which is a sum over a cubic function of the r  charges of fields in the theory , and is thus a function of the @xmath272 .",
    "the exact r  symmetry of the theory at its conformal fixed point is uniquely determined by ( locally ) maximising this function @xmath4 over the space of @xmath272 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath4 at the critical point is precisely the @xmath4central charge of the gauge theory , which is inversely proportional to the volume of the dual sasaki  einstein manifold via the ads / cft formula ( [ adscft ] ) .    now , the ads / cft correspondence states that the subgroup of the isometry group of the sasaki ",
    "einstein manifold that commutes with the reeb vector is precisely the set of flavour symmetries of the dual gauge theory .",
    "recall that we showed that the reeb vector can not mix with the non  abelian part of the isometry group . in complex dimension",
    "@xmath3 , this is the geometrical realisation of the field theory statement that the r  symmetry does not mix with non  abelian factors of the global symmetry group of the gauge theory @xcite .",
    "therefore the minimisation of @xmath1 may always be performed over a space that is at most _ two ",
    "dimensional_. moreover , the @xmath225 , @xmath273 precisely generate the @xmath26 isometry under which the @xmath274form is uncharged and are thus dual to flavour symmetries @xmath270 in the gauge theory . in contrast , note that @xmath4maximisation is generally performed over a larger parameter space , which includes the baryonic symmetries .",
    "however , the results here suggest that , for toric quiver gauge theories , it is possible to perform @xmath4maximisation over a two  parameter space of flavour symmetries .",
    "notice that the problem of determining @xmath275 is reduced to finding the roots of polynomials whose degree generically increases with @xmath60 , implying that the volumes , and hence also charges , of the dual theories are in general _",
    "algebraic numbers_. although all theories considered in examples so far have been found to admit quadratic irrational charges , it is easy to see that more general algebraic numbers are expected as a result of maximising a cubic function of more than one variable",
    ". the precise relation between @xmath1 and @xmath4 for a given toric singularity remains rather mysterious .",
    "it is clear that obtaining a 11 map between these two functions , and the details of the two extremal problems , would improve our understanding of some aspects of these superconformal field theories .",
    "tackling this problem will require a better understanding of how the geometric data is translated into field theory quantities .",
    "one can anticipate that such quantities must be _ invariants _ with respect to the possible choices of toric phase or other field theory dualities .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasise that our results are valid in any dimension , while @xmath4maximisation holds only for duals of five  dimensional sasaki ",
    "einstein geometries . however , the ads / cft correspondence predicts that @xmath276 geometries in m  theory , with @xmath277 a sasaki  einstein seven  manifold , are dual to _ three  dimensional _ @xmath278 superconformal field theories .",
    "the results of this paper therefore suggest that there should exist some analogue of @xmath4maximisation for three  dimensional theories as well .",
    "if true , the details of the argument should differ substantially from those used in reference @xcite  in three dimensions there exist no anomalies to match .",
    "it will be very interesting to pursue this direction and explore the possibility that a field theoretic dual of @xmath1minimisation can be formulated for superconformal field theories in three dimensions .",
