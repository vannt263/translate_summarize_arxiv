    "due in part to their ubiquity among different classes of strongly correlated systems , there is longstanding interest in the effects of quantum phase transitions on physical behavior , especially their role in stabilizing novel electronic phases .",
    "much experimental and theoretical attention has focussed on magnetically ordered metals , and the heavy electron compounds have been especially heavily studied due to their electronic and behavioral diversity , as well as the proven utility of the doniach phase diagram as an organizational scheme for the entire class of materials .",
    "@xcite many magnetically ordered heavy electron compounds have been studied , where both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic transitions have been suppressed to form magnetic quantum critical points .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , the need to make a link between experimental results and theoretical models places considerable constraints on experimental systems . ideally , such compounds should be single crystals of stoichiometric compounds , demonstrated to have low levels of disorder .",
    "as grown , magnetic order should occur at the lowest possible temperatures , but continuous variables such as pressure or magnetic fields can be used to tune the system to the quantum critical point .",
    "tuning criticality using compositional variation is to be avoided if at all possible , due to the profound impact which disorder has been demonstrated to have on some quantum critical systems . for these reasons , most attention has focussed on a few model systems such as ybrh@xmath3si@xmath3 ,  @xcite sr@xmath0ru@xmath3o@xmath4 ,  @xcite and cecu@xmath5au@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite it is clear that in order to make continued progress towards exploring and refining the available theoretical models , new quantum critical systems must be identified which not only have diverse magnetic properties , but also satisfy most - if not all - of these stringent criteria .",

    "molten pb was removed by centrifuging the crucible , isolating the single crystals , which have typical dimensions of 0.2@xmath80.2@xmath81 mm@xmath9 .",

    "[ f7]b , the temperature dependences of the heat capacity and the temperature derivative of the resistivity @xmath26 t are nearly identical , indicating that the resistivity is controlled both above and below t@xmath27 by fluctuations in the magnetization .",
    "@xcite application of a 9 t field ( fig .",
    "[ f7]a inset ) completely suppresses this spin disorder scattering , and renders the underlying resistivity linear in temperature from 0.4 k - 40 k.    our measurements indicate that the antiferromagnetically ordered state is a fermi liquid , albeit one with unusual properties .",

    "despite the bulk antiferromagnetic order observed in the magnetic susceptibility measurements , c / t is poorly described by c / t = t@xmath31exp(-@xmath32/k@xmath33 t ) , while reasonable agreement is found for the expression corresponding to ferromagnetic spin waves c / t = t@xmath34exp(-@xmath32/k@xmath33t)with an anisotropy gap @xmath32=1.2 k. this may suggest that magnetic order in yb@xmath15pt@xmath16 results from the competition between both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "we note , however , that the gradual increase in c / t above t@xmath35 and the t@xmath31 behavior found at the lowest temperatures may be consistent with an underlying schottky peak , implying that the lowest lying yb doublet may be split by @xmath21.6 k , perhaps by the exchange interaction . further experiments , such as measurements of the heat capacity in field , would be needed to test this possibility . in either case",
    ", the vanishingly small value of c / t found at the lowest temperatures suggests that the magnetic excitations which lead to the heat capacity in the ordered state are gapped .",
    "seemingly , this would rule out the possibility that the ordered state is a fermi liquid .",
    "given this conclusion , it is surprising that the electrical resistivity gives unambiguous evidence for fermi liquid behavior in the antiferromagnetically ordered state .",
    "9 shows that @xmath25=@xmath36+at@xmath37 for temperatures smaller than the magnetic ordering temperature t@xmath27=2.4 k , with @xmath36=21 @xmath28-cm , and a= 1.69@xmath810@xmath22 @xmath38-cm / k@xmath37 .",
    "this result shows that a substantial portion of the resistivity in the antiferromagnetic state results from quasiparticle scattering in a fermi liquid , indicating that the relatively large resistivity does not result from strong impurity scattering but is an intrinsic feature of yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude a of the quadratic resistivity is very large , comparable to values found in heavy electron systems such as upt@xmath0.@xcite since the heat capacity measurements rule out the presence of large numbers of massive quasiparticles , we conclude that the large fermi liquid resistivity instead implies that there is a significantly reduced number of quasiparticles in yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 .",
    "we can roughly estimate this number by assuming that the scattering rate per quasiparticle is the same in yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 as in other yb - based heavy electron systems , i.e. that it has the same kadowaki - woods ratio a/@xmath39=1 @xmath28-cm mol@xmath37k@xmath37/j@xmath37 .",
    "@xcite since our heat capacity measurements place an upper bound on @xmath30 of 10 mj / mol - k@xmath37 , this implies that the number of quasiparticles per yb is approximately 10@xmath40 .",
    "electronic structure calculations are needed to confirm this hypothesis .",

    "the dashed line is the expected schottky anomaly if the doublet ground state is split.,width=264 ]    the antiferromagnetically ordered state is characterized by an extremely large magnetic susceptibility .",
    "6a shows that the ac susceptibility in the ordered phase has a temperature independent component which extrapolates to 6.8@xmath810@xmath22m@xmath9/mole - yb .",
    "the temperature independence of this susceptibility suggests that it may be the pauli susceptibility of a fermi liquid .",
    "however , we note that this is a very large value , similar to those found in heavy electron systems , both in absolute terms and especially when weighted per quasiparticle .",
    "the sommerfeld - wilson ratio r@xmath46=@xmath47k@xmath48@xmath49/@xmath50 is a useful figure of merit for judging the strength of ferromagnetic correlations within a fermi liquid .",
    "most heavy electron compounds have r@xmath46 somewhat larger than the kondo value of 2 .",
    "@xcite systems with ferromagnetic enhancement can have significantly larger values of r@xmath46 , such as pd , where r@xmath46=6 - 8 ,  @xcite ybagge , where r@xmath46=2 ,  @xcite ybrh@xmath3si@xmath3 where r@xmath46=13 ,  @xcite and also sr@xmath0ru@xmath3o@xmath4 where r@xmath46=10 .  @xcite the magnitude of the zero temperature susceptibility in yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 is comparable to those of the most enhanced heavy electron compounds ,  @xcite",
    "although the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath30 is several orders of magnitude smaller , implying an unreasonably large value for r@xmath513600 .",
    "we believe that a more likely scenario is that , like the heat capacity , the temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility is dominated by fluctuations of presumably localized yb moments and not the pauli susceptibility of the few quasiparticles which provide the electrical resistivity .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that measurements have been performed on polycrystalline samples of the isostructural compound yb@xmath0pd@xmath1 which have some similarity to the results reported here for yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 .",
    "magnetic order is found in yb@xmath0pd@xmath1 at 3 k ,  @xcite and strong critical scattering is observed in inelastic neutron scattering measurements .",
    "@xcite magnetic susceptibility and x - ray absorption measurements  @xcite find that this compound is - unlike yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 - significantly mixed valent .",
    "it might be interesting to explore this system more thoroughly , in particularly to see whether this mixed valent character could be suppressed by pressure , providing a direct connection to yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 .",
    "the temperature dependent part of the electrical resistivity @xmath52=@xmath25-@xmath36 is quadratic in temperature below t@xmath35=2.4 k ( dashed line).,width=264 ]",
    "the picture which emerges from our measurements on the new compound yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 is that this is system which orders overall antiferromagnetically , with very little magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the transition is weakly first order , and there is little indication of critical fluctuations in either the magnetic susceptibility or the heat capacity . the large magnitude of the low temperature magnetic susceptibility , the observation of a fisher - langer relation between the heat capacity and the temperature derivative of the resistivity , as well as the anisotropy gap found in the ordered phase heat capacity all suggest that the magnetic structure has a net ferromagnetic component as well",
    ". a possible explanation might be that the ground state of yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 involves a long - wavelength ferromagnetic modulation of the antiferromagnetic state similar to that found in the helical ferromagnet mnsi .",
    "@xcite the temperature dependence of the heat capacity and the magnitude of the magnetic susceptibility together indicate that the localized moments continue to be an important part of the physics of the ordered phase .",
    "the most remarkable of our findings is that magnetic order enables the formation of a fermi liquid state in yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 .",
    "antiferromagnetic order emerges from a paramagnetic state involving fluctuations of individual yb moments , and there is little evidence that the apparently localized moments are strongly coupled to conduction electrons via the kondo effect , as they are in quantum critical systems such as the heavy electron compounds .",
    "the electrical resistivity is large for this class of intermetallics , both in the paramagnetic and ordered phases .",
    "however , the substantial loss of spin - disorder scattering associated with the magnetic transition indicates that low carrier density and not strong impurity scattering is likely the primary source of this high but decidedly metallic resistivity .",
    "given this apparent weak coupling between the magnetic moments and the conduction electrons , it is somewhat surprising to find that the resistivity in the ordered state is that of a fermi liquid : quadratic with temperature @xmath25(t)=@xmath53+at@xmath37 , and with a coefficient a as large as those found in heavy electron compounds .",
    "the absence of a large quasiparticle contribution to the heat capacity subsequently implies that the fermi surface in the ordered phase has a small volume , perhaps consisting of isolated pockets .",
    "the central issues surrounding the suitability of an ordering material as an eventual host for quantum criticality are the classification of the phase transition , with respect to order and mechanism , and the ways in which the underlying electronic structure is affected by the onset of magnetic order . while we know that the magnetic ordering phase transition is dominantly antiferromagnetic and weakly first order , the overall classification of the phase transition in yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 into local moment type or fermi surface instability is not wholly settled by our experiments . on the one hand , spin wave expressions provide a reasonable description of the ordered phase heat capacity",
    ", however the magnitude of the magnetic susceptibility is much too large to be conveniently assigned to itinerant fermi surface states . in the local moment",
    "ordering scenario , superzone formation can potentially gap the fermi surface , although the low crystal symmetry of yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 suggests that this gapping would be at best partial .",
    "the large value of the quasiparticle resistivity is consistent with the formation of a fermi liquid comprised of the few states at the fermi energy which survive this gapping . while it would be quite important to know whether these quasiparticles have substantial mass enhancement ,",
    "a definitive determination would require knowing the quasiparticle contributions to the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity , which are apparently masked by the larger local moment contributions .",
    "however , the onset of fermi liquid behavior exactly at the neel temperature suggests that antiferromagnetic order involves a more profound modification to the fermi surface and its excitations than is afforded by simple superzone formation .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that a fermi surface instability plays a role in driving magnetic order in yb@xmath0pt@xmath1 .",
    "more information about the magnetic structure and dynamics in the ordered state , as well as direct determinations of the fermi surface above and below the transition are needed to provide a definitive resolution of this issue .",
