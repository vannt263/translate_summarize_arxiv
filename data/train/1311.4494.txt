    "in many fields of physics and astrophysics one has to study reaction rates in a system that can be considered , to a good approximation , a classical non - relativistic gas in equilibrium . in the gas",
    "can be present different species of particles .",
    "we consider two species with masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 and number densities @xmath6 , the number of particles per unit volume . for a given process with total cross section @xmath7 , the number of reactions per unit time per unit volume , the reaction rate , is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the relative velocity between two particles with velocities @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the cross section is in general function of the relative velocity but we will not write explicitly the dependence .",
    "as it is well known , at a given temperature @xmath2  @xcite , the absolute velocity of the particles follows the maxwell distribution @xmath12 .",
    "the thermally averaged reaction rate then is @xmath13 by changing variables from the velocities @xmath10 , @xmath11 to the velocity of the center of mass @xmath14 and the relative velocity @xmath15 , one finds the standard expression for the thermal averaged rate , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distribution of the relative velocity .",
    "equation ( [ maxwell_vrel ] ) has the same form of the maxwell distribution for the absolute velocity but with the reduced mass @xmath18 in place of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in place of @xmath21 .    if the colliding particles are relativistic corrections to eq .",
    "( [ nr_rate ] ) can be important .",
    "on the other hand , conceptually , both the relative velocity ( [ vrelnr ] ) and the maxwell distribution ( [ maxwell_vrel ] ) are not compatible with the fact that @xmath22 for two massive particles must be smaller than velocity of light @xmath23 in every inertial frame , while the relative velocity between two massless particles and between a massless and a massive particle is always equal to the velocity of light .",
    "it is thus interesting to ask if a probability distribution for the relative velocity compatible with the principles of special relativity exists . in this paper",
    "we show that such a distribution exists and that @xmath24 is just its non - relativistic limit .",
