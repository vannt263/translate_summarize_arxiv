    "albert einstein never published a technical paper directly addressing the problem of the relativistically rotating rigid disk , although in private writings@xcite , in three books for the general audience@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and as support for the use of generalized coordinates in his landmark 1916 paper@xcite , he purported that the space of such a rotating disk is curved , not flat .",
    "he further attributed his early insights into general relativity theory to be a direct result of contemplating the curvature of such a rotating system .",
    "his perspective on the problem is revealed in a private 1919 letter found by stachel@xcite in the einstein archives at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey .    in that letter",
    "einstein considers measuring rods laid out along the disk s radii and circumference and assumes lorentz contraction exists along the circumference due to the tangential velocity @xmath1= @xmath2 of the disk at a given radius @xmath3 . in einstein s words :    _ _ .... imagine a `` snapshot '' taken from [ the non - rotating frame ] ... on this snapshot the radial measuring rods have the length l , the tangential ones , however , the length l__@xmath4v@xmath5_. the `` circumference '' [ therefore is ] u _ = [ _ 2@xmath6r_]/(@xmath7 - v@xmath8/c@xmath8)@xmath9    he repeated this type of reasoning elsewhere [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] , and used it to conclude that the rotating disk surface is not euclidean since @xmath10 .    but not everyone agrees . in a 1951 letter@xcite einstein noted that eddington and lorentz considered the geometry on the disk to be flat , and he stated that he did not know what they meant .",
    "no references recounting eddington s and lorentz s thinking on the subject seem to be available , but others , such as levy@xcite , appear to agree with them .",
    "strauss@xcite concludes that the space is curved , but argues that einstein s logic was flawed , noting that    _ if the measuring rods laid along the circumference of the rotating disk are lorentz contracted with respect to the inertial frame , so are the distances on the circumference they are supposed to measure ; hence the two effects would cancel each other , and the ratio _",
    "u / d _ would turn out to equal @xmath6 as in the euclidean plane . _",
    "grn @xcite , however , citing mller @xcite and landau and lifshitz @xcite , contends that this argument is wrong , weber @xcite supports grn s view , and stachel [ 1 ] effectively concedes the point to einstein .",
    "special relativity is restricted to inertial systems and is derived from two symmetry postulates :    \\1 .",
    "the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers ( it is invariant ) and equals @xmath11    \\2 .",
    "there is no preferred inertial reference frame .",
    "( velocity is relative , and the laws of nature are covariant , i.e. , the same for all inertial observers . )",
    "general relativity is applicable to non - inertial systems and is based on generalizations of the above two postulates embellished with other certain principles / assumptions , including :    \\1 .",
    "the speed of light is invariant and equals @xmath12 for non - inertial observers provided that it is measured locally by local standard clocks and measuring rods @xcite .",
    "there is no preferred non - inertial frame .",
    "( the laws of nature are also covariant for non - inertial observers , although coordinate metrics different from those of special relativity are needed to represent those laws . )",
    "\\3 . gravity and acceleration are _ locally _ indistinguishable , i.e. , the equivalence principle .",
    "( over finite distances , gravity can , however , be distinguished from acceleration due to the presence of gravitational tidal forces or geodesic deviation . )",
    "neither gravity nor acceleration changes the length of a standard rod or the rate of a standard clock relative to a nearby freely falling ( inertial ) standard rod or standard clock having the same velocity .",
    "( this is an assumption rarely emphasized in most texts , though mller@xmath13[11 ] makes the point clearly , and einstein @xcite emphasized it a number of times . ) we will call this the `` surrogate frames postulate '' or when used with reference to standard rods , the `` surrogate rods postulate . ''",
    "the first general relativity point above is often a source of confusion , as it is sometimes said that the speed of light in general relativity can be different than @xmath12 .",
    "this is true if , for example , one measures the speed of light near a massive star using a clock based on earth .",
    "( time on such a clock is effectively the coordinate time in a schwarzchild coordinate system . )",
    "as is well known , due to the intense gravitation field , the passage of time close to the star is dilated relative to earth time , and one would indeed calculate a light speed other than @xmath12 .",
    "however , use of standard rods and clocks adjacent the light ray itself would result in a speed of precisely @xmath12 .",
    "other confusion exists for scenarios where spacetime itself expands or contracts .",
    "for example , just after the big bang , space itself was expanding much like the surface of a balloon being blown up . a photon in space ( analogous to an ant on the surface of the balloon ) at a different location than an observer",
    "could then move away from the observer faster than @xmath12 ( analogous to faster than the ant can crawl on the surface ) because the space ( balloon surface ) between the photon and the observer is itself expanding .",
    "yet a photon spatially coincident with an observer could never be seen by that observer to have speed greater than @xmath12 , and local standard rods and clocks adjacent any photon would find its speed equaling @xmath12 regardless of the dynamical state of spacetime itself .",
    "upper - case letters herein shall refer to inertial systems ; lower case to non - inertial systems .",
    "for example k shall designate the non - rotating ( lab ) frame ; k , the rotating frame .",
    "flat spacetime will be referred to as `` minkowski space '' ; whereas the term `` minkowski metric '' will be limited to refer only to a minkowskian set of coordinates ( cartesian plus time ) used within that flat space .",
    "hence a minkowski space need not be represented solely by a minkowski metric , and we will in fact use cylindrical coordinates , i.e. , ( _ _ ct , r,__@xmath14,@xmath15 ) , for the flat non - rotating inertial frame .    though much of the paper may be understood with no working knowledge of differential geometry ( the mathematics of general relativity ) , in sec . 4 it is needed to derive certain results .",
    "these derivations are based on a minkowski metric defined as    @xmath16}\\;,\\quad \\quad \\alpha , \\beta = 0,1,2,3\\ ] ]    to eliminate confusion for the non - specialist , and to more readily compare results with those of einstein and others , we employ cgs , not geometrized , units where @xmath172.998 x 10@xmath18 cm / sec .        in 1913",
    "sagnac @xcite first demonstrated experimentally that rotating disks exhibit a remarkable property , the significance of which the present author believes has been completely overlooked ever since .",
    "that is , the local speed of a beam of light tangent to the disk circumference is not invariant , and not isotropic ( as seen from the disk ) .",
    "1 depicts the sagnac experiment schematically .",
    "a light beam is emitted radially from the center of a rotating disk and is split by a half silvered mirror m at radius @xmath3 . from there",
    "one part of the beam is reflected by mirrors appropriately placed on the disk such that it travels in one direction around the circumference .",
    "the other half of the beam travels the same route over precisely the same distance , but in the opposite direction .",
    "the beams then meet up again and are reflected back to the center where interference of the two beams results in a fringing , i.e. , a displacement of one light wave with respect to the other .",
    "this is exactly the effect michelson and morley were first looking for , but could , due to now well known relativistic effects , never detect .",
    "fringing results in either experiment would have implied different velocities of light in different directions .",
    "hence , while the michelson - morley result indicated that for translational motion the speed of light is invariant and isotropic , the sagnac experiment indicates that for rotational motion , no such conclusion may be drawn .",
    "the results of sagnac and others who have repeated his experiment have experimental accuracy only to first order in @xmath19 = @xmath20 , and indicate that the speed of a light ray tangent to the circumference measured locally on the disk is equal to @xcite    @xmath21    where the approximately equal sign implies accuracy to first order , and the sign in front of the last term depends on the relative direction of the rim tangent and light ray velocities .",
    "these results should , in fact , be expected .",
    "an inertial ( non - rotating ) observer of the two light rays would see each of them having the speed @xmath12 , and during the time they are traveling around the circumference the disk would rotate some amount .",
    "hence one ray would meet back up with the half - silvered mirror m before the other , and an observer fixed on the disk at m would conclude that the speeds in each direction were different .",
    "further , the difference can be readily calculated , to first order , to be that shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "( selleri @xcite makes the calculation rigorously to all orders . )",
    "still further , the effect is _ local _ since angular velocity is constant and due to symmetry , any segment of a constant radius path ( in the ideal experimental design ) is equivalent to any other segment .",
    "hence any global ( average ) speed effect measured by sagnac over finite times and distances is equal to the local ( infinitesimal ) speed at any point on the circumference .",
    "the michelson - morley experiment also implied that translational velocities are relative , and that there is no preferred system of reference ( no `` ether '' ) .",
    "rotational velocities , on the contrary , are absolute .",
    "( the term `` absolute '' herein implies accordance with mach s principle , i.e. , absoluteness with respect to the distant galaxies , within einstein s relativistic theory of flat spacetime ) .",
    "this is due , at least in part , to the absolute nature of the radially directed accelerations experienced by any rotating object .",
    "hence , for rotational velocities there is a preferred frame , and it is the one in which no radial accelerations are experienced .",
    "any observer , in any frame , can tell which system is the non - rotating one , i.e. , the `` preferred frame '' , and how much each of the other frames is rotating relative to it .",
    "this can be done by watching the motion of a foucault pendulum , by noticing whether or not there is a coriolis `` force '' , or by a number of other means .",
    "the reader has no doubt noticed that the experimental results of sec .",
    "1.4 above appear to clash with the very postulates of sec .",
    "1.2 upon which the theory of relativity was founded .",
    "that is , all of the relativistic behavior with which we have become so familiar in the twentieth century , such as the lorentz contraction and the lack of agreement on simultaneity , are a direct result of i ) invariance of the speed of light , and ii ) `` reference frame democracy '' ( all frames are equal ) .",
    "yet , the author contends , these postulates simply do not hold for rotating frames .",
    "this point seems to have been overlooked for two reasons .",
    "firstly , much of the literature [ 16 ] covering the sagnac effect focuses on the fringe effect _ per se _ , and its concomitant mathematical description , without noting the significant implications such fringing has for the speed of light .",
    "secondly , of those who were aware that this implied a variable speed of light , most probably glossed over the fact by assuming that in some manner it was merely another general relativistic ( non - inertial systems ) manifestation of the `` light speed unequal to @xmath12 effect '' . yet , unlike the examples provided in sec .",
    "1.2 , there is no expansion or contraction of spacetime associated with the rotating disk , and the fringing implies a true difference in the _ local _ measurement of light speed .",
    "therefore one should , indeed _ must _ , expect rotating frame behavior to differ from that of translational motion .",
    "relativistic effects such as the lorentz contraction are not given _ a priori _ ; they are derived .",
    "and they are derived from different empirically based principles than those governing rotational motion .",
    "hence , we should be wary of conclusions drawn by simply applying derived tenets of relativity theory to rotating disks , as einstein and others have done .",
    "the riemann curvature tensor ( or simply `` riemann '' ) @xmath22 is a measure of the curvature of a given space .",
    "it is defined by virtue of the geodesic deviation _ _ _ _ equation of differential geometry @xcite ,    @xmath23    the first term above represents the _ deviation _ between _ two _ geodesics , i.e. , the rate of change of the rate of change in proper distance of the perpendicular from the first geodesic to the second as one travels along the first . if @xmath22 is zero , then eq . ( [ eq3 ] )",
    "dictates that every pair of geodesics which are initially parallel will stay parallel along their entire length .",
    "the proper distance between them will never change , and they will never intersect . since this is true only of flat spaces , a zero value for @xmath22 means the space is flat .",
    "if@xmath24 , such as on the surface of a globe , two geodesics ( e.g. , lines of longitude ) which start out parallel ( at the equator ) , do nt stay parallel ( and cross at the poles ) .",
    "@xmath22 is characteristic of the space itself , not the coordinate system used within that space . if , for example , @xmath22 = 0 for a 2d flat space with cartesian coordinate system , when we transform to a polar coordinate system , we still have @xmath22 = 0 .",
    "it is commonly known @xcite that the four - dimensional ( 4d ) spacetime of the rotating system ( denoted k ) is riemann flat since @xmath22 = 0 in the non - rotating frame ( denoted k ) , and the rotating system coordinates are obtained by simply transforming the 4d coordinates of k into k. if riemann is zero in k , it must also be zero in k. however , it does not necessarily follow that the subspace of the disk surface , embedded in the 4d space , is flat . by analogy , the 2d subspace surface of a sphere embedded in a flat 3d space is not itself flat .",
    "particles attached to the rotating disk undergo acceleration and hence do not follow geodesic paths .",
    "the path of a free particle or light ray , however , is a geodesic , and though it is straight as seen from k , it looks curved , even `` corkscrew - like , '' as seen from k.    the question of flatness for the subspace of the disk can be addressed by considering two free particles traveling at the same velocity in k in the plane of the disk surface ( i.e. , the axial coordinate @xmath15 = constant ) , and tracing out parallel lines in k. the observer in k sees them as straight and never intersecting .",
    "the rotating observer sees them as corkscrew - like and never intersecting .",
    "the point is that the geodesic equation , from which the riemann tensor is defined , relates to the `` never intersecting '' part , not the `` non - straight '' part . in a curved space",
    "there is geodesic _ deviation_. it says two geodesics _ deviate _ in their behavior .",
    "the two geodesics in question do not .",
    "further , the two geodesics travel _ in the plane of the disk _ _ surface . _ regardless of how one wishes to define the disk surface and all of the issues of simultaneity involved ( see later sections ) , the basic fact remains that for @xmath25 = constant , the two geodesics do not deviate ( i.e. , they never cross ) . for a riemann curved surface they must deviate .",
    "therefore the disk surface is riemann flat .    by analogy , two parallel geodesics which appear straight in an inertial system",
    "appear curved to an observer in a rectilinearly accelerating system .",
    "but they never appear to cross to the accelerating observer , and the proper distance between them never changes .",
    "as is well known , the space of a rectilinearly accelerating system is flat @xcite .",
    "this is in full accord with eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) since geodesic deviation for such a system is zero , and so is riemann , even though geodesics themselves do not look straight .",
    "geodesic deviation causes tidal forces , the stretching and compressing of a finite sized object in free fall ( i.e. , traveling a geodesic ) .",
    "gravity tries to make one side of the object accelerate in a different direction , or at a different rate , than the other side .",
    "but a finite sized object traveling along a geodesic in the plane of the rotating disk would not@xmath26experience any tidal forces , and _ all _ observers , whether on the disk , the lab , or anywhere else , would agree there is no stress or strain within the object .",
    "hence riemann is zero along the path of the object , and the surface of the disk can not be curved .",
    "applying traditional relativistic concepts directly to the rotating disk leads to another striking difficulty .",
    "it predicts a discontinuity in time on the surface of the disk , and in addition , the location of that discontinuity is arbitrary , being merely a function of the particular predilections of the observer . in other words , a continuous standard tape measure extending one circumference around the rim would not meet back up with itself at the same point in time .",
    "the logic leading to this conclusion follows .    in order to evaluate disk curvature ,",
    "prior researchers have invoked the `` surrogate frames postulate '' ( see general relativity principle 4 of sec .",
    "1.2 ) and used a series of inertial reference frames tangent to the disk rim with velocities equal to that of the rim edge ( i.e. , with @xmath1= @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is argued that since acceleration body forces do not affect standard rod length , rods in these inertial frames should be affected in precisely the same manner as rods aligned with , and attached to , the edge of the disk rim in k.    the problems with this approach can be illustrated with the aid of fig .",
    "inertial measuring rods in inertial frames k@xmath27 to k@xmath28 with speeds @xmath2 can be imagined as shown . for practical reasons",
    "we only show eight finite length rods , and we consider them as a symbolic representation of an infinite number of rods of infinitesimal length . a and b are _ events _ located in space at the endpoints of the k@xmath27 rod which are simultaneous as seen from k@xmath27 ; b and c are events located in space at the endpoints of the k@xmath29 rod which are simultaneous in k@xmath30 ; and so on for the other events c to j. a , b ,",
    "... j can be envisioned as flashes of light emitted by bulbs situated equidistantly around the disk rim .",
    "p is a spatial ( three dimensional ) point fixed to the disk at which both a and j occur .",
    "q is the spatial point on the disk at which b occurs . in principle ,",
    "a , b , ... j , as well as p and q are located on the disk rim though they may not look so in fig .",
    "2 since the tangent rods shown are not infinitesimal in length .",
    "note that although events a and b are simultaneous as seen from k@xmath31 , they are not simultaneous as seen in k ( via standard relativity theory for two inertial frames in relative motion ) . as seen from k , a occurs before b. similarly , b occurs before c , and so on around the rim . if the events are light flashes , a ground based observer looking down on the disk would see the a flash , then b , then c , etc .",
    "hence we conclude that as seen from k , a occurs before j even though a and j are both located at the same 3d point p fixed to the rim .",
    "as seen from k , during the time interval between events a and j the disk rotates , and hence the point p moves .",
    "( as an aside , fig .",
    "2 can now be seen to be merely symbolic since events a to j would not in actuality be seen from k to occur at the locations shown in fig .",
    "2 . that is , by the time the k observer sees the b flash ,",
    "the disk has rotated a little .",
    "it rotates a little more before he sees the c flash , etc . )",
    "according to the traditional treatment of the rotating disk , one then uses the k@xmath32 rods and integrates ( adds the rod lengths ) along the path ab ... j , moving sequentially from tangent inertial frame to tangent inertial frame .",
    "this path is represented by the solid line in fig . 3 , and one can visualize small minkowski coordinate frames situated at every point along the curve aj ( see k@xmath29 in fig .",
    "3 ) with integration taking place along a series of spatial axes ( such as x@xmath29 in fig .",
    "3 ) . by doing",
    "this one arrives at a length for aj , the presumed circumference of a disk of radius r , of precisely as predicted by einstein and many others    @xmath33    but consider that since point p moves along a timelike path as seen from k ( see dotted line in fig .",
    "3 ) , a time difference between events a and j must therefore exist as measured by a clock attached to point p. as a result , one end of a continuous tape measure riding with the rim of the disk would not meet back up with its other end at the same point in time . but any meaningful measurement of the circumference simply must have the same starting and ending event , and therefore must be a _ closed path _ in spacetime .    we have therefore shown that the tangent frames analysis approach leads to a discontinuity in time , a seemingly impossible physical situation .",
    "even further , the spatial location of that discontinuity is completely arbitrary .",
    "it depends on where we choose our initial starting point p. this is a very serious dilemma for the traditional interpretation .",
    "we conclude that simultaneity can not be defined in a consistent manner using local inertial clocks over any closed path where different parts of the path have different relative velocities .",
    "hence , we are unable to measure the circumference of the rim with local inertial rods where the endpoints of all the rods are simultaneous as measured by local inertial clocks .",
    "therefore , inertial frames tangent to the rim can not be used to measure the disk circumference , and conclusions made from so doing will not be valid .",
    "this apparent violation of the heretofore seemingly sacrosanct `` surrogate rods postulate '' is addressed in sec .",
    "ehrenfest @xcite saw a paradox in the presumed circumferential lorentz contraction effect which einstein @xcite and grn @xcite attempted to resolve by claiming that the disk circumference tries to contract in lorentz fashion , but ca nt , and so undergoes internal tensile stress .",
    "other mechanically induced stresses aside , the disk presumably can not be spun up to relativistic speeds without developing such stresses and , at high enough speeds , rupturing .",
    "but one must then also argue that the time discontinuity of fig .",
    "3 is resisted in some way by a `` tension '' in the time component around the circumference .",
    "if the rods must be extended in order to meet up in space , then surely the endpoints of rods must be adjusted in time in order to meet up as well . tensile stress may be a well known physical phenomenon in a material body in space , but there is certainly no such phenomenon associated with time .",
    "a related problem is pointed out by several authors ( see , for example weber [ 13 ] ) .",
    "if light rays sent out around the circumference are used according to the standard einstein synchronization procedure , one finds the clock at p at 360 to be out of synchronization with itself at 0 .",
    "this leads to the restriction that one can only consider open paths on the disk surface .",
    "but then one must ask what prevents a physical disk based observer from traveling around one complete circumference ? and what prevents her from laying down a continuous tape measure as she does so ? and",
    "finally , how good a representation of the physical world is a model in which a clock can not be synchronized with itself ?",
    "in this section we re - derive key aspects of relativity theory for the rotating reference frame using two new postulates based on the sagnac and other experiments .",
    "we follow logic similar to that employed by einstein to derive special relativity for translational motion , but start from a different , but equally empirically justifiable , basis .    in sec",
    ". 4 transformation techniques of differential geometry are utilized to rigorously derive all relevant characteristics of the rotating frame , including the exact form of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , our first postulate below . the present sec . 3 , on the other hand ,",
    "provides a physically meaningful , and simpler , derivation of certain of those characteristics .",
    "we postulate the following :    \\1 .",
    "the speed of light is not invariant between the ground and the rotating frame , and in the rotating frame is found to first order by the velocity addition law of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] )    @xmath34    \\2 .",
    "observers can discern which frame is non - rotating ( the `` preferred frame '' ) .",
    "4 depicts a means for defining simultaneity at any radius r on the disk .",
    "light rays can be imagined as emitted simultaneously from the centerpoint of the disk , striking mirrors located at @xmath35 and being reflected back to the centerpoint .",
    "they all arrive back at the center at the same instant in time as measured by a clock located there , and one concludes that the events occurring when the light struck the mirrors are all simultaneous .",
    "these events are also simultaneous to observers in k.        the question then arises as to whether a non - inertial observer riding on the rim itself would agree that those same events are simultaneous .",
    "standard relativity theory predicts she would not , since she and the k observer have relative velocity difference .",
    "we answer this question by re - considering einstein s famous _",
    "experiment of the passing train shown in fig .",
    "5 . lightning strikes both ends of the car and leaves marks on both ends plus the ground .",
    "these events are a and b. given the postulate that light has the same velocity as seen from the train or the ground , and given that both observers can later measure the distance to the brown marks left by lightning events and determine that each is 1/2 way between their respective marks , the train observer concludes that a occurred before b because she saw the a flash of light first .",
    "this she concludes because she knows the speed of light from both directions is the same for her .",
    "the ground observer sees each flash at the same instant and concludes the two events were simultaneous since the speed of light is also the same for him in both directions .",
    "this is case 1 , the standard special relativity result .",
    "for case 2 , suppose instead that nature works in galilean fashion and the light from a travels faster than the light from b as seen from the train frame .",
    "( @xmath36v@xmath37 = c + @xmath38 and @xmath36v@xmath39 = c - @xmath38 where @xmath38 is the absolute value of the relative velocity between frames . )",
    "the train observer still sees the a flash first , and still later measures the distance to the marks and knows she is 1/2 way between them .",
    "but now she also knows that the light from a travels faster , so she would expect to see it first .",
    "the math is trivial .",
    "she concludes that a and b were indeed simultaneous , as does the ground observer .    as shown by the sagnac experiment the speed of light on the circumference of the disk behaves as in the second case above .",
    "( assume for the present that eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is an exact equality .",
    "we will resolve the first order approximation issue in sec .",
    "the observer on the disk knows she is rotating , knows she has tangential velocity relative to the inertial frame k , and knows from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) the formula for calculating the velocity of light as seen by her ( it is direct addition as for the train case 2 above . ) she therefore concludes that two spatially proximate events on the circumference which are simultaneous in the ground frame are also simultaneous to her even though she sees one of them occur first .",
    "hence , whether measured from the center of the disk , or locally at any other point on the disk , simultaneity in the disk frame k is identical with that of k. ( selleri [ 18 ] agrees with this conclusion , although he takes a different route to get there . ) so unlike systems with relative rectilinear velocities where there is no common agreement in simultaneity , systems with relative rotational velocities all do agree on simultaneity .",
    "the lorentz contraction is a direct result of non - agreement in simultaneity between frames .",
    "if there is agreement in simultaneity , there is no lorentz contraction . to show this we need one additional , presumably inviolable , postulate .",
    "that is ,    \\3 .",
    "the proper spacetime length of any path is invariant under any transformation , i.e. , it is the same for all observers .    hence , for two frames in relative motion ( notation should be obvious )    @xmath40    for a rod at rest in the primed frame , an observer in the unprimed frame sees that rod such that its endpoints are _ events _ which for him occur simultaneously , i.e. , @xmath41 = 0 . but in the primed system those events are not , according to standard relativity theory , simultaneous and @xmath42 .",
    "this means @xmath43 , and results in lorentz contraction @xcite .    if , however , the same two events could also appear simultaneous in the primed system , then",
    "@xmath44 = 0 , and @xmath45must equal @xmath46 .",
    "this is , of course , not possible for two frames in relative _ translational _ motion , but , as we have shown , it is possible between two frames with different _ rotational _ motion .",
    "hence , if @xmath47is the length of a ( short ) standard measuring rod attached to the non - rotating k frame aligned tangentially to the disk rim , and @xmath48 is the length of a similar rod attached tangentially to the rim , then neither rod looks shortened to observers in either frame .",
    "there is , therefore , no lorentz contraction for rotating systems .",
    "the reader should note carefully the distinction here between with the contention of grn [ 10 ] and others @xcite that rods fixed to the disk will not contract since tension in the disk prevents them from so doing . in contradistinction",
    ", we show that there is simply no kinematic imperative for the rods to try to contract .",
    "no tension arises in the disk as it is spun up , and no relativistically induced rupturing occurs .",
    "although frames k and k agree on simultaneity , it can be shown that standard clocks in each run at different rates .",
    "( note that two clocks running at different rates can nonetheless both agree on simultaneity , i.e. , that no time elapsed off either one between two events . )",
    "the time dilation effect can be demonstrated with the aid of the spacetime diagram of fig .",
    "6 , which shows the helical path of a clock fixed on the disk as seen from frame k and that of a clock fixed in k as seen from k. the moving clock travels the path of 3d point p of fig . 3 extended for one full rotation .",
    "the path of that clock is a non - geodesic , while the path of its `` twin '' fixed in k is a geodesic , a straight line .",

    ".    note that in both inertial frames k and k@xmath27 , the speed of light ray mn equals c. we can therefore conclude that general relativity principle 1 remains valid , provided we constrain it to refer to time orthogonal frames ( such as the minkowski , schwarzchild , and friedman geometries ) .",
    "it does not hold for non - time - orthogonal frames .",
    "non - time - orthogonality also reconciles the results of sec .",
    "2.3 ( tangent frames can not be used to measure the circumference ) with the heretofore seemingly universal applicability of the surrogate rods postulate of sec .",
    "we note first , however , that the tangent frames do not , strictly speaking , have the same velocity as the disk rim .",
    "the rim segment , in addition to its linear velocity component @xmath162 , has an angular velocity @xmath57 which the tangent frame does not .",
    "hence , unlike other successful applications of the surrogate rods postulate , the tangent frames here do _ not _ mimic the rim frame velocity in all regards .",
    "therefore , they can not , in the truest sense be considered `` co - moving '' as many prior researchers have assumed . to see the effect of this in terms of non - time - orthogonality , we first consider the underlying principles on which the surrogate rods postulate is based .",
    "8 shows two spatially coincident standard rods with zero relative velocity , the first of which is fixed in a rectilinearly accelerating frame k@xmath163 , and the second of which is fixed in an inertial frame k. consider two light flash events a and b located at the endpoints of both rods .",
    "an observer in k at the centerpoint of the inertial rod sees both flashes at the same time and concludes they were simultaneous as seen from the k frame .",
    "likewise , an observer on the k@xmath163 rod halfway between a and b would see them at the same time as well and know that the events were also simultaneous as seen from the k@xmath163 frame .",
    "that is , @xmath164 = @xmath161 = 0 between a and b. since the proper spacetime length between the two events is the same as seen from both frames ( i.e. , _ _",
    "@xmath165 = @xmath166 ) , then the spatial length between them must also be equal , and the length measured by rods in k@xmath163 and k between a and b are equal .",
    "similar arguments can be made for acceleration in the rod lengthwise direction , as well as for gravitational body forces induced by a massive body .",
    "hence the surrogate rods postulate is merely a restatement of the proper spacetime path length invariance postulate for the special case where @xmath111(time ) = 0 for both observers ( which it is for zero relative velocity and time orthogonal frames ) .",
    "9 and 10 reveal what this means in the context of non - time - orthogonal reference frames .",
    "9 depicts two inertial reference frames , k and k@xmath27 , in relative motion , and serves as a review of the cause of the lorentz contraction effect .",
    "a rod fixed in k@xmath27 has length@xmath167 = @xmath168 as seen from k@xmath27 .",
    "the endpoints ( and all points between ) of@xmath169 move with velocity @xmath1relative to k along world lines parallel to the k@xmath27 time axis .",
    "lorentz contraction arises because the observer in k sees rod endpoint events as a and c , whereas the observer in k@xmath27 sees them as a and b. @xmath167 , the distance between a and c is less than@xmath168 , the distance between a and b , by the lorentz contraction factor . though it is beside the point we are in the process of making , the lorentz contraction effect is thus seen to be little more than an optical illusion fostered on us by lack of agreement in simultaneity .",
    "no lorentz contracted object ever feels compressed .",
    "in contrast with fig .",
    "10 shows the rotating coordinate frame k at radius @xmath3 superimposed with the non - rotating inertial frame k. in fig .",
    "10 we show two circumferentially aligned standard rods , one designated by @xmath170 which rides with the disk and the other , @xmath155 , fixed in k. when both rods are at rest in the same inertial system , they have equal length , i.e. , @xmath170 = @xmath155 .",
    "when the disk is spinning they also have equal length , as seen by both k and k observers , since , as discussed earlier , the same endpoint events ( d and e ) of both rods are seen as simultaneous in both frames . yet , due to the special nature of the non - time - orthogonal frame k at @xmath3 , the @xmath170 _ _ _ _ rod has a non - zero velocity relative to the @xmath155 rod .",
    "every point on the @xmath170 rod in fig .",
    "10 moves with the same velocity as every point on the @xmath171 rod in fig .",
    "9 . yet @xmath171 looks contracted from k , whereas @xmath170 does not , i.e. ,    @xmath172    that is , even though @xmath171 and @xmath170 have the same velocity as seen from k , they do not have the same spatial length as seen from k. prior researchers have almost universally assumed they do .    that @xmath171 looks contracted as seen from k can be corroborated by superimposing the k frame of fig .",
    "10 with the k@xmath27 frame of fig .",
    "9 . hence ,",
    "two rods with the same velocity , one in a time orthogonal frame and one in a non - time - orthogonal frame do not have equal lengths .",
    "we conclude that the surrogate rods postulate is only valid for time orthogonal frames .",
    "several researchers [ 13,18 ] have considered the limiting case of very large radius , small angular velocity , with large circumferential velocity @xmath173 in this case acceleration @xmath174 approaches zero , and it is argued there is no way to discern between such a frame and an inertial frame .",
    "hence , a circumferential segment of the rotating frame in such case must approximate an inertial ( lorentzian ) frame .",
    "the answer to this conundrum lies in non - time - orthogonality . from fig . 7",
    "it can be seen that the slope of the time axis in the k frame is c/@xmath38 , and as we have shown , the sagnac effect , the lack of lorentz contraction , and all other peculiarities of the rotating frame are derivable from non - time - orthogonality , i.e. , the slope of that axis . but in taking the limit described , @xmath38 remains constant , and hence so does the slope of the time axis",
    ". therefore , all of the non - lorentzian phenomena heretofore described for rotating frames are unmitigated in passing to the limit .",
    "( see also sec . 6 . )",
    "contrary to what many claim , an observer on this limiting case frame can determine she is rotating .",
    "in fact , three experiments can reveal this .",
    "the first is the sagnac experiment .",
    "the second is described in section 6.2 below .",
    "the third involves measuring the mass of a known entity such as an electron which varies relativistically with the potential energy , i.e. , as a function of @xmath175 alone as in eq .",
    "( [ eq26 ] ) , and hence one can readily determine @xmath176",
    "given the speed of our planet around its sun , and the speed of our solar system around its galactic center , one might ask why measurements on our planet ( which could be considered as part of a frame rotating about the center of each of these systems ) do not seem to exhibit the aforementioned non - lorentzian properties .",
    "in particular , why did michelson and morley not find the speed of light in the direction of galactic rotation different from that in other directions ?",
    "note that given the sagnac results , this question has an empirical imperative which is independent of any theory , i.e. , any particular rotating frame analysis .",
    "the answer , the author submits , is that bodies in gravitational orbits follow geodesics , i.e. , they are in `` free fall '' .",
    "that is , they are in locally inertial frames and therefore obey lorentzian mechanics .",
    "objects fixed in `` true '' rotational frames , on the other hand , are held in place by non - gravitational forces , do not travel geodesic paths , and exhibit sagnac type characteristics . hence , the only effective rotational velocity for the earth is the earth surface velocity about its own ( inertial ) axis .",
    "michelson and gale @xcite did in fact measure the sagnac effect for the earth s surface velocity in the 1920 s . and in order to be maintain accuracy , the global positioning system must apply a sagnac velocity correction to its electromagnetic signals @xcite .      the most significant experiment , however , and the most accurate michelson - morley type test to date is that of brillet and hall @xcite .",
    "they found a `` null '' effect at the @xmath41/@xmath77= 3x10@xmath177 level , ostensibly verifying standard relativity theory to high order .",
    "however , to obtain this result they subtracted out a persistent `` spurious '' signal of amplitude 2x10@xmath178 at twice the apparatus rotation frequency .    compare this anomalous signal to that predicted by the presently proposed theory .",
    "the velocity of the earth surface at 40@xmath179 latitude , where the brillet and hall experiment was performed , is .355 km / sec . if the speed of light is truly increased or decreased by this amount in the direction of rotation , then a michelson - morley experiment ( see fig .",
    "11 ) with one leg in the direction of the velocity would yield @xcite    @xmath180    where @xmath77is the round - trip time for one leg and @xmath41 is the difference in time taken between the leg aligned with the velocity vector and the leg perpendicular to that vector .",
    "brillet and hall rotated their equipment about a vertical axis ( always perpendicular to the earth surface velocity ) .",
    "in such a case eq .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) would yield the peak - to - peak amplitude of the signal . to compare with brillet and hall",
    "s reported single peak amplitude signal , one must then divide eq .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) by two . using .355 km / sec in eq .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) and dividing by two , one gets @xmath181/@xmath77= 3.5x10@xmath0 . fig .",
    "12 can help to explain the reason for the discrepancy in this number and the reported value .    in fig .",
    "12 the two light rays no longer travel solely on two perpendicular paths . in the brillet and hall experimental apparatus a similar configuration to that of fig .",
    "12 was used , apparently to accommodate the laser equipment which provided such extraordinary accuracy .",
    "( see fig . 1 in brillet and hall .",
    ") note that if the two shorter legs @xmath182were each 25% the length of the primary legs @xmath157 , then the time @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) would be 1.25 times that of fig .",
    "note also that the lower of the @xmath112 legs is aligned perpendicularly to the velocity , whereas the lower path is intended to monitor light speed in the direction of the velocity vector . if both it and the upper @xmath112 leg were 25% of the primary legs in length",
    ", one could therefore expect a 25% reduction in @xmath41 as well .",
    "hence the total signal @xmath183would be a reduced by a factor of .75/1.25 = 60% .",
    "although brillet and hall did not provide the pertinent dimensions in their paper , from the sketch of their equipment one can conclude that the 25% figure used above may be fairly accurate . to account for this approximation",
    "we can assume a signal strength modification factor of 50% to 70% .",
    "for these percentages , the expected signal range is 1.7 - 2.5x10@xmath184 , in remarkable agreement with the measured value of 2x10@xmath185 .",
    "note also that in the brillet and hall experiment signals were exchanged electronically between the two legs , and that actual fringing at a single location was not measured .",
    "hence , we may expect the variation in light speed to affect these transmission signals as well , introducing additional error .",
    "the author also investigated possible mitigating effects from `` frame dragging '' ( a @xmath186 off diagonal term appearing in the metric due to the earth s angular momentum ) , and the chord path effect ( the light ray parallel to the velocity actually travels a chord of the arc length , not the arc length itself ) .",
    "these were found to be negligible to orders of magnitude well beyond 10@xmath0 .    for completeness",
    ", we also mention the results of hils and hall @xcite which found no variations to an order of 2x10@xmath178 ( only coincidentally the same number as above . )",
    "however , the hils and hall apparatus was fixed relative to the earth s surface and hence was immune to variations of the type predicted by the present theory ( which would manifest only if the apparatus were rotated relative to the earth surface . )",
    "we propose another experiment using a combined sagnac and michelson - morley type apparatus in order to further test the present theory .",
    "for this experiment light is emitted from a rotating disk center in the manner of the sagnac experiment , but a michelson - morley type apparatus is mounted on the disk rim .",
    "when the light from the center reaches the rim it is split into two components .",
    "one of these travels along the circumference a short distance and then is reflected directly backwards ( rather than further out around the rim . )",
    "the other component of the light is reflected in the z direction ( perpendicular to the disk ) an equal distance and reflected directly backwards as well .",
    "the two returning components are then deflected toward the disk center where fringe effects are measured .",
    "accelerating the disk , and accounting for elastic deformation , one should find the degree of fringing varies .",
    "the standard theory predicts no such variation .",
    "with regard to electrodynamics , ridgely [ 33 ] has recently used covariant constitutive equations in an elegant analysis to answer a troubling question cogently posed by pellegrini and swift [ 32 ] .",
    "he uses transformation ( [ eq8 ] ) to derive electrodynamic results for the rotating frame k , not the tangent frames k@xmath32 , and finds that those results match what one would find by simply applying maxwell s equations and traditional special relativity to the tangent frames .",
    "we can conclude the following . only with the theoretical approach shown herein",
    "can one obtain internally consistent results which agree with all experiments .",
    "however , for the purposes of mass - energy , momentum , and time dilation calculations ( shown herein ) and maxwell s equations ( shown by ridgely ) , one can get away with assuming that the tangent frames represent the rotating frame and using traditional special relativity . that is , in these cases the laws of nature conspire to make both the present and the traditional analysis produce the same result for observers in k ( i.e. , mass - energy dependence on @xmath57r , electric polarization , etc . ) .",
    "when it comes to matters of time ( synchronization , simultaneity ) , space ( curvature ) , and    michelson - morley / sagnac type experiments , however , then analysis must be confined to the rotating frame itself , else the inconsistencies of sec . 2 and inexplicable `` spurious '' experimental signals inevitably arise .",
    "it therefore appears that the rotating disk problem may have , at long last , been completely solved . according to ridgely s results and the theory proposed herein , no paradoxes remain and all theory matches up with the physical world as we know it .",
    "the lack of lorentz contraction , agreement in simultaneity , flatness of the disk surface , non - invariant / non - isotropic speed of light , and time dilation can all be derived in two different ways : ( i ) directly from transformation ( [ eq8 ] ) ; and ( ii ) from the sagnac experiment .",
    "all but the asterisked phenomena summarized below can be determined in at least two ways ( i.e. , transformation ( [ eq8 ] ) , experiment , or thought experiment based on sagnac ) . an asterisk ( * ) indicates the conclusion depends only on the validity of transformation ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the subspace surface of a rotating disk is flat .",
    "\\2 . no circumferential lorentz contraction exists .",
    "further , no relativistically induced tensile stress develops as there is no kinematic imperative for the disk circumference to try to lorentz contract .",
    "observers anywhere in the rotating frame and observers in the non - rotating frame all agree on simultaneity .",
    "velocities ( angular and translational * ) add directly frame - to - frame and not relativistically .",
    "angular velocities are absolute and have no upper speed limitation .",
    "rods in inertial frames with velocities equal to the tangent velocities at a given disk radius can not be used to measure the circumference , since    \\a .",
    "the `` surrogate frames postulate '' for equivalence of inertial and non - inertial standard rods is not valid for the rotating frame , and is generally invalid for any non - time - orthogonal frame , and    \\b .",
    "doing so leads to a discontinuity in time .",
    "light has a null path length , yet the local speed of light in the rotating frame ( and all non - time - orthogonal frames ) is not isotropic and generally not equal to @xmath12 .",
    "time dilation does occur , but it is not symmetric , i.e. , rotating and non - rotating observers agree that time dilation occurs on the disk relative to the stationary frame .",

    "( no asterisk since cyclotron experiments validate this effect . )    \\10 . only the theory proposed herein yields self consistent results which completely conform with physical reality .",

    "the proposed theory resolves all difficulties with the traditional disk analysis delineated in sec .",
    "2 .    both the proposed theory and the traditional analysis agree with cyclotron experiments , i.e. , they both predict time dilation ( longer particle decay times ) , as well as relativistic mass - energy dependence on speed .",
    "both theories are also consonant with the phipps @xcite experiment which has been used to discount certain other prior approaches to the problem not based on transformation ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "importantly , however , the new theory predicts the results of the brillet and hall [ 38 ] experiment which the standard theory does not .",

    "<S> the rotating disk problem is analyzed on the premise that proper interpretation of experimental evidence leads to the conclusion that the postulates upon which relativity theory is based , particularly the invariance of the speed of light , are not applicable to rotating frames . </S>",
    "<S> different postulates based on the sagnac experiment are proposed , and from these postulates a new relativistic theory of rotating frames is developed following steps similar to those initially followed by einstein for rectilinear motion . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting theory agrees with all experiments , resolves problems with the traditional approach to the rotating disk , and exhibits both traditionally relativistic and non - relativistic characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> of particular note , no lorentz contraction exists on the rotating disk circumference , and the disk surface , contrary to the assertions of einstein and others , is found to be riemann flat . </S>",
    "<S> the variable speed of light found in the sagnac experiment is then shown to be characteristic of non - time - orthogonal reference frames , of which the rotating frame is one . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the widely accepted postulate for the equivalence of inertial and non - inertial standard rods with zero relative velocity , used liberally in prior rotating disk analyses , is shown to be invalid for such frames . </S>",
    "<S> further , the new theory stands alone in correctly predicting what was heretofore considered a `` spurious '' non - null effect on the order of 10@xmath0 found by brillet and hall in the most accurate michelson - morley type test to date . </S>",
    "<S> the presentation is simple and pedagogic in order to make it accessible to the non - specialist .    </S>",
    "<S> key words : relativistic , rotating disk , sagnac , rotating frame , non - time - orthogonal frame . </S>"
