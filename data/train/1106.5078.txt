    "it is well established that sunspots and magnetic plage are strong absorbers and scatterers of the sun s acoustic @xmath0-mode waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the absorption is unexpectedly large , reaching values as high as 70% for sunspot groups and a lesser , but still substantial , value of 20% for magnetic plage .",
    "equally strong phase shifts are also observed for sunspots , with shifts as large at 100@xmath1 being possible .",
    "interestingly , plages lack measurable phase shifts , despite possessing significant absorption @xcite .    initial attempts to model the interaction of acoustic waves with magnetic features concentrated on the absorption caused by sunspots , as the observed signal was strong and easy to measure .",
    "a host of absorption mechanisms were investigated , including resonant absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mode mixing @xcite and mode conversion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the present belief is that mode conversion from acoustic waves to slow magnetosonic waves within an appreciably inclined magnetic field is responsible @xcite . under this paradigm",
    ", acoustic energy is transformed into slow waves which propagate along the field lines removing energy from the @xmath0-mode cavity .",
    "the conversion process is most efficient when the phase velocity of the incident acoustic wave matches the local phase velocity of the slow mode .",
    "such strong coupling of the phase velocities occurs when two conditions are met : the wavenumber vector of the incident acoustic wave is nearly parallel to the magnetic field and the alfvn and sound speeds are comparable . in a sunspot ,",
    "the alfvn and sound speeds are equal to each other in a layer just below the solar surface and the ray paths of the @xmath0 modes in this layer are such that the strongest conversion occurs in regions with field lines that are inclined 2030 degrees from vertical ( such as within penumbrae ) . in addition to successfully explaining the absorption observed for sunspots , mode conversion models have also succeeded in reproducing the large phase shifts @xcite .",
    "so , while we presently have a fairly good understanding of how a flaring , monolithic , magnetic structure such as a sunspot can absorb and scatter acoustic waves , we have made little progress in modelling the observed absorption by plage .",
    "the absorption within a plage is smaller than that of a sunspot by only a factor of two , yet the mode conversion process is unlikely to work in the same manner , as the field within a plage has a fractured and fibril nature , and probably has less inclined field of a structured geometry in the photospheric layers . the limited theoretical work that has been done modelling the effects of fibril magnetic fields indicates that multiple scattering may play a very important role @xcite . @xcite",
    "examined multiple scattering between a small number of flux tubes ( 23 ) in an unstratified atmosphere and found that resonant absorption by the collection of tubes can be greatly enhanced if the tubes are tightly spaced .",
    "@xcite performed a similar calculation but considered incident @xmath0-mode waves trapped within a solar - like wave guide and their interaction with thin flux tubes .",
    "tirry permitted tube waves excited on the magnetic fibrils to freely cross the bottom boundary of the acoustic waveguide and discovered that such wave leakage destroyed the absorption resonances observed by @xcite .",
    "both studies lacked gravitational stratification .",
    "neither of these studies included a sufficiently large number of tubes to reliably estimate the expected phase shifts measured in plage .",
    "the lack of measurable phase shift is likely to be the result of incoherent scattering from a large number of tubes .",
    "@xcite examined whether the wave leakage mechanism explored by tirry is sufficiently large on its own to explain the absorption observed within plage .",
    "they modeled a plage as a large collection of thin magnetic tubes embedded in a stratified atmosphere and considered each tube to absorb acoustic waves in isolation from the other members of the collective .",
    "the mhd tube waves excited on each tube by the incident @xmath0 mode freely propagate along the fibril out of the acoustic cavity despite the gravitational stratification .",
    "they found that high levels of absorption ( potentially greater than 50% ) were easily achieved .",
    "however , they did not take into account scattering between tubes or the screening that is likely to occur for tubes located far from the edge of the plage .    to date",
    "few studies have examined both the _ absorption _ and _ scattering _ of acoustic waves by magnetic tubes residing in a _ gravitationally stratified _ atmsophere .",
    "notable are those of @xcite and @xcite which focused on the scattering of the dipole component of incident @xmath2 modes from thin magnetic tubes through the excitation of kink waves , and the study by @xcite that , through numerical simulation , examined axisymmetric scattering from tubes of general thickness . here",
    "we examine scattering and absorption of the wavefield s monopole component of both @xmath2 and @xmath0 modes from a thin magnetic tube in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere .",
    "the scattering is mediated through the excitation of axisymmetric sausage waves that travel up and down the fibril .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : formalism ] we present our scattering formalism . in section [ sec : matrices ] , we calculate the scattering matrices .",
    "section [ sec : absorption ] describes the absorption achieved and the properties of the mode mixing across mode order that occurs , while section [ sec : phases ] presents the resulting phase shifts .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : discussion ] we discuss our findings and conclusions , including what our results for a single tube adumbrate for plage .",
    "we consider a compact magnetic fibril that is embedded within a field - free atmosphere .",
    "the fibril is axisymmetric , straight and aligned with gravity . under such conditions the acoustic wavefield in the surrounding , nonmagnetized atmosphere can be expressed as the sum of three components ,    @xmath3    here @xmath4 can represent any physical variable we might choose to consider ; however , we will restrict our attention to a plane - parallel atmospheric model that is neutrally stable to convection  a good approximation within the sun s convection zone .",
    "for such an atmosphere , acoustic waves can be described using a displacement potential and we will let @xmath4 be this potential .",
    "the first term , @xmath5 , is the unperturbed @xmath0-mode wavefield that would exist in the absence of the magnetic flux concentration ( i.e. , the _ incident _ wavefield ) .",
    "the second term , @xmath6 represents a discrete set of far - field _ scattered _ waves in the form of propagating @xmath0 modes .",
    "finally , @xmath7 is the contribution due to the continuous spectrum of laterally evanescent , near - field , _ jacket _ modes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we can express an arbitrary wavefield of incident @xmath0 modes as a fourier - bessel expansion in cylindrical polar coordinates , @xmath8 , where the origin is centered on the flux concentration ,    @xmath9    in this expression  and in the subsequent two  we have chosen to apply temporal fourier transforms @xmath10 and to work in frequency space .",
    "our fourier convention is such that our solutions have a temporal dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath12 are arbitrary complex amplitudes that characterize the incident wavefield , @xmath13 is the bessel function of the first kind , @xmath14 is the vertical eigenfunction for the @xmath15th - order @xmath0 mode , and @xmath16 is the wavenumber eigenvalue for the @xmath15th - order @xmath0 mode with frequency @xmath17 .    since we have assumed that the magnetic fibril is axisymmetric , incident waves of azimuthal order @xmath18 only scatter into waves with the same order .",
    "therefore , for such an axisymmetric scatterer , the scattering only occurs across mode order @xmath15 , and the explicit form of the scattered waves can be represented as follows :    @xmath19    in these expressions @xmath20 is the hankel function of the first kind  corresponding to an outward propagating cylindrical wave , and @xmath21 is the modified bessel function of the second kind , with @xmath22 being the lateral decay length for the jacket modes .",
    "there are two separate scattering matrices : @xmath23 is the far - field scattering matrix that represents scattering into outgoing , propagating @xmath0 modes , whereas @xmath24 is the near - field matrix and represents the excitation of the acoustic jacket . in this formalism , mode mixing appears as nonzero values for the off - diagonal elements of the far - field scattering matrix ( i.e. , @xmath25 for @xmath26 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath27 describe the vertical behavior of each jacket mode and are oscillatory with depth .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 mode eigenfunctions @xmath28 and the jacket modes @xmath29 form a complete , orthogonal set .",
    "we shall make use of this orthogonality property in the following section to compute the scattering matrices .",
    "appendix  [ app : eigenfunctions ] describes in detail the @xmath0 mode eigenfunctions and jacket waves appropriate for the neutrally - stable , polytropic atmosphere .",
    "in general , the two scattering matrices , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , tell us everything we need to know about the wave - tube interaction , including the absorption coefficient @xmath32 and phase shift @xmath33 . for a particular mode ( i.e. , a particular @xmath18 and @xmath15 )",
    "the absorption coefficient is defined as one minus the ratio of the outgoing power to the ingoing power contained by that mode ,    @xmath34    the phase shift is defined in the usual way , as the phase difference between the ingoing and outgoing components ,    @xmath35    if we consider only a single incident wave , we can relate the absorption coefficient and phase shift to the scattering matrices in a straight forward manner . noting that an incident wave component is comprised of outgoing and ingoing parts of equal amplitude , @xmath36 , the outgoing and ingoing amplitudes , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
    "are then given by ,    @xmath39 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if we now insert these expressions for the ingoing and outgoing power into equations  ( [ eqn : abscoef_def ] ) and ( [ eqn : phaseshift_def ] ) , we find    @xmath40    for realistic wave fields ( e.g. , as sampled by helioseismic observations )",
    "these simple formulae are invalid .",
    "firstly , multiple incident waves of all mode orders @xmath15 exist simultaneously .",
    "secondly , mode mixing ( the scattering from one mode order @xmath15 to a different mode order @xmath41 ) will result in the outgoing component of any mode order being comprised of the scattered waves from all incident mode orders .",
    "one goal of this paper is to assess the importance of mode mixing in the energy budget of an incident wave .",
    "fortunately this can be accomplished by examining each incident mode in isolation , and computing the off - diagonal elements of the scattering matrix .",
    "we will leave for a subsequent study the effects that a complex , multi - component incident wave field has on measured absorption coefficients and phase shifts .",
    "further , we will only consider mode mixing across mode orders .",
    "we presume that the scatterer is axisymmetric ; therefore , scattering from one azimuthal order @xmath18 to another @xmath42 does not occur .",
    "finally , for simplicity we have chosen to examine only the axisymmetric component ( @xmath43 ) of the incident wavefield , leaving higher - order waves to subsequent studies .",
    "the index @xmath18 will be dropped from most expressions from here forward .",
    "scattering matrices have been computed previously for axisymmetric magnetized tubes within unstratified atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , calculating the scattering matrices for a magnetic tube in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere is formidable and can only be accomplished in general through numerical wave - field simulations . however , if we assume that the magnetic flux tube is thin and untwisted , substantial progress can be made without resorting to computer simulation . by _",
    "thin _ , we mean that all characteristic scale lengths  such as the wavelength of the external acoustic oscillations and the density scale height  are much larger than the radius of the tube @xmath44 .",
    "such a thin flux tube , although in hydrostatic balance , is unable to support internal lateral forces ; hence , the total pressure will be uniform across the tube and continuous with the external value .",
    "this mandates that the total pressure has the same scale height inside and outside the tube .",
    "if we further assume that the temperature is the same within the tube as outside , the plasma parameter @xmath45 , defined as the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure , is constant with height inside the tube . for photospheric and deeper layers ,",
    "this assumption that the tube is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings is consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "thin tubes with constant @xmath45 are theoretically attractive , as they permit analytic treatment of the waves that propagate along them and prove to be weak scatterers for which asymptotic analysis may be used .",
    "the scattering matrices are determined by the application of two physical matching conditions . at the interface between the magnetic tube and the surrounding field - free atmosphere ,",
    "both the total pressure perturbation and the normal component of the fluid displacement must be continuous . in general , thin flux tubes permit two types of magnetosonic waves , sausage and kink waves .",
    "the sausage waves are axisymmetric ( @xmath43 ) , longitudinal , slow surface waves with pressure as the primary restoring force .",
    "the kink waves are sinuous , transverse , fast waves with @xmath46 and a restoring force composed of magnetic tension and buoyancy .",
    "since we will only be considering axisymmetric incident waves , the solution within the magnetic tube will be composed of only sausage waves .",
    "we mention for completeness that magnetic tubes also permit torsional alfvn waves which are also axisymmetric oscillations",
    ". however , acoustic - gravity waves within a neutrally - stable atmosphere are irrotational and are unable to couple to torsional waves .",
    "the propagation of sausage waves on magnetic fibrils is reasonably well understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such waves have the property that the total pressure is nearly constant across the cross section of the tube and matches the overpressure in the field - free surrounding media .",
    "furthermore , the normal component of the fluid displacement at the boundary of the tube is a small quantity of the same size as the radius of the tube ( which is presumed small by the thin tube approximation ) .",
    "the smallness of the normal displacement enables the solution inside the tube to be obtained to leading order with only the enforcement of pressure continuity ; the continuity of the displacement appears only in higher - order corrections @xcite .",
    "here we explicitly consider these higher order terms in order to compute the scattered wave field .    outside the flux tube",
    ", a small argument expansion of the bessel functions appearing in equation  ( [ eqn : incident ] ) reveals that , to lowest order in the radius of the flux tube @xmath47 , the pressure perturbation of the incident wave is a zero - order quantity @xmath48 , whereas the normal displacement is first order @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the ordering of terms for the incident waves is the same as the sausage waves .",
    "however , similar expansions of equations  ( [ eqn : scattered ] ) and ( [ eqn : jacket ] ) reveal that the far - field and near - field scattered waves have a pressure perturbation whose leading - order terms are proportional to @xmath50 or @xmath51 , respectively , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 indicate the leading - order behavior of the scattering matrices",
    ". the normal displacements for these waves are proportional to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the size of each of these terms for each wave component is summarized in table 1 .",
    "careful scrutiny reveals that the manner in which a balance can be successfully achieved , where both continuity conditions are satisfied , is if the scattering matrices are to leading order proportional to @xmath56 . with this behavior",
    ", pressure continuity is maintained by a balance between the sausage wave and the incident wave ; the scattered waves play no role to leading order .",
    "continuity of the normal displacement involves a balance between the sausage wave and all three external wave components ( incident , far - field scattered and near - field scattered ) .",

    "we calculate the energy budget for a single incident wave and account for all the ways that the incident wave energy can be reprocessed by the scatterer .",

    "this mechanism is a true absorption process whereby acoustic energy is removed from the system .",
    "( 2 ) the incident wave can generate an acoustic jacket that surrounds the flux tube .",

    "the thin tube approximation mandates that the excitation of tube waves generates an absorption coefficient that scales linearly with the magnitude of the scattering matrix , which in turn scales like the square of the tube",
    "s radius @xmath56 , a small quantity by definition .",
    "the energy losses due to mode mixing are even smaller , scaling as the square of the magnitude of the scattering matrix , or as @xmath114 . therefore , mode mixing can only be important energetically when other sources of absorption ( i.e. , tube wave excitation ) are peculiarly small . over the physically relevant range of frequencies ( @xmath115 mhz ) ,",
    "our calculations reveal that mode - mixing dominates the absorption coefficient only for high - frequency @xmath2 modes interacting with low-@xmath45 tubes .",
    "any model with a reflective upper boundary can have special frequencies for which the excitation of tube waves is unusually tiny .",
    "if the upper boundary reflects all wave energy , the excitation can formally be zero at these frequencies .",
    "such  excitation nulls \" arise because of total destructive interference .",
    "a localized driver , such as an incident @xmath0 mode , excites waves that propagate both up and down the tube with equal energy . at these special frequencies ,",
    "the upward propagating wave reflects off the upper surface with just the phase needed to cancel the downward propagating wave @xcite .",
    "in such a circumstance the downward energy flux vanishes and no energy is carried away from the acoustic cavity by tube waves .",
    "near such an excitation null , the energy losses arising from mode mixing could be the dominant source of energy loss  not because mode mixing is large , but because the other source of absorption is small .    for the stress - free upper boundary condition applied here and for reasonable atmospheric and tube parameters ,",
    "excitation nulls do not appear within the physically relevant frequency band ( @xmath116 mhz ) .",
    "however , formally for the @xmath2 mode such a null exists in the limit of infinite frequency and it has extremely broad influence , causing the absorption coefficient to asymptote to zero as the frequency becomes large .",
    "the frequency regime for which this asymptotic behavior is valid depends on @xmath45 , with lower @xmath45 pushing the behavior to lower frequencies .",
    "physically , such behavior exists because the @xmath2 mode is a surface wave that becomes increasingly confined to the photospheric layers as the frequency increases .",
    "the @xmath2 mode s evanescence length @xmath117 can be derived directly from its dispersion relation @xmath118 , revealing that the vertical extent of the @xmath2 mode scales as @xmath119 .",
    "the wavelength @xmath120 of the sausage wave at the photospheric surface can be derived from equation  ( [ eqn : homogeneoustubewave ] ) ,    @xmath121^{1/2 } \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega } \\ ; .\\ ] ]    as the frequency increases , @xmath120 shrinks , scaling as @xmath122 ; however , it decreases more slowly than the scale length of the @xmath2 mode decreases ( which scales as @xmath119 ) .",
    "therefore , as the frequency increases , compared to the tube wave the driver looks more and more like a delta function located at the surface .",
    "a delta - function driver generates waves that propagate in each direction with identical amplitude and phase .",
    "if one of those components subsequently reflects off a surface and passes back through the driving layer , there is the potential for destructive interference ( as discussed previously ) .",
    "destructive interference occurs if the phase of the reflected wave advances by an odd integer factor of @xmath123 .",
    "this phase advance can come from a phase change on reflection or from propagation of the wave to the reflecting layer and back . for the @xmath2 mode",
    ", one can show that the phase change on reflection asymptotes to @xmath124 as the frequency becomes large ( see appendix  [ app : highfrequency ] ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 mode , in the limit of infinite frequency , satisfies the necessary resonance condition because the distance between the driving layer and the photospheric reflection layer vanishes .",
    "the @xmath0 modes do not evince such high - frequency behavior for the simple reason that at high frequency , the depth of the cavity becomes roughly constant with frequency .",
    "the wavenumber eigenvalue @xmath125 scales linearly with the frequency , thereby causing the horizontal phase speed @xmath126 and the lower turning point of the @xmath0 mode to approach constants .",
    "since , the depth of the cavity and hence the vertical extent of the driving region does not change as the frequency changes , the wavelength of the sausage waves becomes much shorter than that of the @xmath0 modes .",
    "thus , for incident @xmath0 modes , the driving region remains vertically distributed and the arguments that we made previously for the @xmath2 mode are not valid .",
    "figure  [ fig : highfreq ] illustrates this behavior for @xmath127 . while the figure extends to frequencies as large as 30 mhz , one must bear in mind that frequencies greater than 6 mhz are greater than the sun s photospheric acoustic cutoff ; thus , such waves are no longer trapped and the construction of our solar model is suspect .",
    "further , one must be careful to not over - interpret the results at such extreme frequencies as the perturbation scheme has become invalid ( see figure  [ fig : highfreq ] ) . despite this , for the @xmath2 mode , trapped waves of low frequency ( where the perturbation analysis remains valid ) can still sense the presence of the excitation null at infinity , causing a high - frequency fall - off of the absorption .",
    "the frequency of waves affected depends on the plasma parameter @xmath45 of the tube because the wavelength of the tube wave depends on @xmath45 .",
    "we can estimate the lowest frequencies that should be affected by requiring that the wavelength of the sausage waves @xmath120 be two or three times larger than @xmath2 mode s evanescence length @xmath117 .",
    "if we require that the ratio of these length scales satisies @xmath128 , we discern that for @xmath127 we would expect the high frequency regime to exist for frequencies above 3 mhz , whereas for @xmath129 the regime begins around 10 mhz .",
    "this discussion only holds for absorption and mode mixing resulting from the excitation of the slow sausage wave .",
    "similar calculations performed with fast kink oscillations reveal that excitation nulls can appear for all incident mode orders at frequencies less than 6 mhz @xcite ; also see @xcite for a similar phenomenon in an unstratified model .",
    "further , the calculations of the scattering matrix elements arising from coupling to kink oscillations ( @xmath130 ) @xcite show significant oscillatory modulation in the magnitudes as a function of frequency , whereas our scattering calculation for the axisymmetric sausage wave ( @xmath88 ) show smooth frequency variation .",
    "in fact one could fit the magnitude of the scattering matrix calculated here with a single power law in frequency that would be roughly valid over all but the highest frequencies .    in a real plage",
    ", we do not expect such excitation nulls to have an easily identifiable effect other than a diminution of absorption at high frequencies for the @xmath2 mode .",
    "not only does mode mixing tend to fill in the absorption profile , but the plage is likely to be comprised of a large number of tubes with a distribution of properties , including photospheric radius @xmath131 and plasma parameter @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , each tube in the collection will have suppressed absorption over a different range of frequencies .",
    "the added affect of all of the tubes will be to mitigate the effect of nulls @xcite .",
    "in general , we expect most flux tubes in a plage to have a near equipartition of magnetic and gas pressure , thus tubes with @xmath132 should predominate . a quick examination of figure  [ fig : absorb ] reveals that only the most extreme frequencies are likely to be affected",
    ".    to summarize , we find that for thin tubes , mode mixing is a small effect compared to tube wave excitation .",
    "the scattering matrix itself has elements that are proportional to the cross - sectional area of the tube .",
    "tube wave excitation extracts energy at a rate proportional to the scattering matrix ( or proportional to the cross - sectional area of the tube ) while mode mixing redistributes energy at a rate proportional to the square of the scattering matrix .",
    "phase shifts are generally defined as the difference in phase between the outgoing wave in the presence of the scatterer and the phase that would have existed in the absence of the scatterer . a magnetic tube",
    "can generate a phase shift by three distinct mechanisms : ( 1 ) the ingoing acoustic wave reflects off the lateral surface of the tube , shortening the total path length traveled by the wave .",
    "( in the absence of the tube , the wave would travel all the way to the coordinate axis and back . )",
    "since the wave travels a shorter distance , the presence of the tube causes a phase lag resulting in a negative phase shift or travel - time difference .",
    "( 2 ) the wave is at least partially transmitted through the lateral surface and propagates at a different speed within the magnetic tube .",
    "if the phase speed increases , a negative phase shift is achieved .",
    "( 3 ) upon reflection off the lateral surface of the tube , the wave can undergo a phase change . off course if a flux - tube boundary could be treated as a rigid , impenetrable surface , the phase change would be 180 degrees .",
    "but , in general a flux tube is elastic and the phase change may differ from 180 degrees and may be either positive or negative .    for our thin flux - tube model , the only wave permitted within the tube is a sausage wave corresponding to a slow surface wave",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for such a wave , the thin flux - tube approximation precludes lateral variation by implicitly assuming that the wave crossing time is much shorter than the wave period .",
    "thus , for all tubes the crossing time for the tube should be ignored , resulting in a common negative phase shift , independent of @xmath45 .",
    "obviously the phase shift whould be equal to the phase lag that would have occured in the unmagnetized model for a wave propagating a distance equal to the tube diameter .",
    "this shows that for thin flux tubes , mechanisms 1 and 2 discussed in the previous paragraph are essentially the same .",
    "this is not true for thicker tubes for which the travel time across the tube is significant .",
    "a rough estimate of the expected phase shift would be @xmath133 , where @xmath131 is the photospheric radius of the tube and we have _ assumed _ that the phase lag should be evaluated at the photospheric surface .",
    "this is clearly appropriate for the @xmath2 mode as it is a surface wave confined to this layer . for @xmath0 modes one should probably consider a depth weighted average of the tube radius .",
    "however , for our purposes , the previous expression will suffice .",
    "estimates made this way for the @xmath2 mode give a phase shift of @xmath134 , which for waves at 3 mhz give a phase shift of -15@xmath1 .",
    "this surprisingly large shift is about a factor of four larger than the phase shifts we obtain with our model ( see [ fig : phase_shift ] ) , indicating that a phase change upon reflection is likely to be at work as well .",
    "we point out that despite the large size of the estimated shift , it is quite similar in magnitude and of the same sign as actually measured phase shifts for small magnetic features .",
    "@xcite measured the average scattering from roughly 2500 small magnetic elements , and generated a typical travel time kernel from their measurements .",
    "one can obtain a typical phase shift of -14@xmath1 by the following process . multiply the largest value of the measured kernel in figure 6 from @xcite ( roughly -20 s kg@xmath135 mm@xmath135 ) by the average magnetic flux of the studied features ( 0.6 kg mm@xmath136 ) to obtain a travel time lag of -12 s.",
    "convert this time lag into a phase shift by dividing by a wave period ( 300 s ) and multiplying by 360 degrees .",
    "the phase change that occurs at reflection from the lateral boundary of the flux tube is difficult to estimate , as the reflection depends on both the incident wave and the driven sausage wave over a range of heights .",
    "we would like to receive guidance from calculations performed for unstratified , thin tubes , for which analytic solutions are possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the regime in frequency  wavenumber space for which slow surface waves exist and for which propagating external acoustic waves exist are disjoint .",
    "thus , for unstratified tubes a propagating acoustic wave can not excite slow surface waves .",
    "the stratification in our model is what makes the coupling possible .",
    "we can safely say , however , that the phase shift caused by mechanisms 1 and 2 always result in negative shifts for thin tubes .",
    "further , we would expect the phase change upon reflection ( mechanism 3 ) to increase for tubes of higher @xmath45 since such tubes are more elastic .",
    "for the @xmath2 mode this is indeed what we achieve ; the phase shift is large and negative at all frequencies ( probably as a result of a reduced path length ) and becomes less negative as @xmath45 increases ( probably due to an increasing positive phase change at reflection ) .",
    "however , for @xmath0 modes we obtain shifts of both signs ; negative phase shifts at low frequency and positive shifts at high frequency . clearly for the @xmath0 modes a positive phase change upon reflection at the flux - tube boundary must occur for at least high frequencies .",

    "this formulation is different from the one used in appendix b because we will exploit symmetries possessed by the green s function and the present formulation makes those symmetries explicit . in particular , note that the function @xmath266 is symmetric upon the interchange of @xmath267 and @xmath268 .    in expression  ( [ eqn : greenssolution ] ) , @xmath211 is a complex constant that determines the boundary condition applied to the sausage wave at the surface of the truncated polytrope . for a stress - free surface",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath211 is given by ,          if one inserts equation  ( [ eqn : greenssolution ] ) into expression  ( [ eqn : smatrix_2parts ] ) , integrates by parts , and uses the fact that the @xmath0-mode eigenfunctions and the tube wave solutions vanish at infinity ( @xmath87 ) , one can obtain the following expression after some manipulation ,          it is trivial to demonstrate that @xmath273 is symmetric . since the variables @xmath267 and @xmath268 in the integrals are dummy variables , we can exchange them ( @xmath274 and @xmath275 ) and then exchange the order of integration .",
    "further , the function @xmath266 is symmetric to interchange of its two arguments .",
    "therefore , after performing these exchanges we find the forestated symmetry , @xmath276 .",
    "thus , the symmetry of the far - field scattering matrix hinges on the properties of the matrix @xmath277 , which contains boundary terms arising from the integration by parts as well as a contribution that comes from the homogeneous solution appearing in the first term in equation  ( [ eqn : greenssolution ] ) . under some common boundary conditions for the sausage waves ,",
    "this matrix is symmetric , but in general it is not .",
    "one can readily verify by directly inserting expressions  ( [ eqn : bcstress - free ] ) or ( [ eqn : bcmax - flux ] ) into equation  ( [ eqn : bmatrix ] ) , and using the identity for the wronskian of two hankel functions ,      that both of the boundary conditions mentioned previously ( stress free and minimum reflectivity ) produce a symmetric matrix , @xmath279 .",
    "therefore , at least for these two boundary conditions , the far - field scattering matrix is also symmetric .",
    "the crucial properties that were required for this symmetry are ( 1 ) the @xmath0 modes satisfy hermitian boundary conditions , ( 2 ) the sausage wave vanishes deep in the atmosphere ( @xmath87 ) , and ( 3 ) the sausage wave satisfies a boundary condition at the surface of the truncated polytrope ( @xmath233 ) that causes the boundary term matrix @xmath277 to be symmetric ( note , not necessarily vanishing ) .",
    "this proof is very reminiscent of the calculation that is performed to demonstrate that a differential operator is hermitian ; however , in this case the operator in question is actually an integro - differential operator ( because of the integration over the green s function ) .",

    "<S> we examine the scattering of acoustic @xmath0-mode waves from a thin magnetic fibril embedded in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering is mediated through the excitation of slow sausage waves on the magnetic tube , and only the scattering of the monopole component of the wavefield is considered . since such tube waves are not confined by the acoustic cavity and may freely propagate along the field lines removing energy from the acoustic wavefield , the excitation of fibril oscillations is a source of acoustic wave absorption as well as scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the mode mixing that is achieved and the absorption coefficients and phase shifts . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for thin tubes the mode mixing is weak and the absorption coefficient is small and is a smooth function of frequency over the physically relevant band of observed frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the prominent absorption resonances seen in previous studies of unstratified tubes are absent . despite the relatively small absorption , </S>",
    "<S> the phase shift induced can be surprisingly large , reaching values as high as 15@xmath1 for @xmath2 modes . </S>",
