    "a systematic and consistent scenario of high mass star formation has not been constructed yet . in spite of enormous and intense works , there are many hypotheses and unsolved issues ( e.g. , @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "but , several recent theoretical studies have suggested that high mass star formation can be achieved via mass accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this hypothesis seems to be consistent with observational signatures of massive accretion disk and torus around high mass protostellar object ( hmpo ) or protocluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "upcoming atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) will be able to resolve such a circumstellar structure enough and provide us more quantitative information about a specific accretion mechanism onto an individual hmpo .",
    "precise distance of a source is essential to quantitative discussions .",
    "however , most of the high mass star - forming regions , which will be targets for alma , are even located on the inner galactic plane , where source distances often contain significant uncertainty .",
    "direct distance measurements by astrometric observations are quite important for such regions , in especial , highly accurate vlbi ( very long baseline interferometry ) astrometry is the only technique suitable for deeply embedded high mass star - forming regions where optical measurements are almost impossible . @xcite has been first demonstrated great performance of vlbi astrometry using h@xmath0o maser in w3(oh ) region , and since then , several studies have achieved 10 micro - arcsecond ( @xmath4as ) accuracy for northern star - forming region ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this paper , we report on an annual parallax measurement of h@xmath0o masers in the high mass star - forming region g5.89 - 0.39 with vera ( vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ; @xcite ) .",
    "g5.89 - 0.39 ( also known as w28a2 ) is one of the most famous , shell type ultra compact ( uc ) h@xmath2 region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the o - type ionizing star has been detected as a near - infrared ( nir ) point source by @xcite inside the shell ( hereafter feldt s star ) .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter acw98 ) have directly measured dynamic angular expansion of the radio shell . observed supersonic expansion and short dynamical age ( 600 yr ) indicate that this small uch@xmath2 region is just after the birth .",
    "g5.89 - 0.39 is also known to be a host of an extremely massive outflow which is centered on the shell ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the whole part of the shell is completely inside the outflow extent ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this also gives further support on a remarkable youth of the uch@xmath2 region .",
    "previously reported distances for g5.89 - 0.39 vary over a wide range ( 1.9 - 3.8 kpc ; @xcite , and reference therein ) . almost all of them are measured through kinematic distance method , but at the galactic longitude of 5@xmath5.89 , this method intrinsically contains large systematic error of kpc order . although acw98 tried to estimate the distance from the shell expansion without any galactic rotation models , they still have adopted several assumptions for their modeling of the data . in this point of view",
    ", our direct distance measurement is very important to confirm the physical parameters of g5.89 - 0.39 .",
    "vera observations of the h@xmath0o masers ( @xmath6 = 6@xmath75@xmath8 ) at 22.23508@xmath9ghz associated with g5.89 - 0.39 have been carried out at 9 epochs between 2007 november and 2009 may .",
    "a summary of all observations is listed in table [ tb : obs ] , which contains observing dates , synthesized beam sizes in milli - arcsecond ( mas ) , beam position angles ( pa ) east of north , spectral resolutions , typical noise levels and dynamic ranges of synthesized images and brief comments , if any , about system noise temperatures ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "each observation was made in vera s dual - beam mode in which targeted maser source and phase calibrator ( or position - reference source ) were observed simultaneously ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the real - time , instrumental phase difference between the two beams was measured for a calibration using the artificial noise sources during the observations @xcite .",
    "we chose j1755 - 2232 ( @xmath11= , @xmath12= ; @xcite ) as a paired calibrator .",
    "this source is separated from g5.89 - 0.39 by 1@xmath5.92 at a position angle of -140@xmath5 east of north .",
    "the flux density of j1755 - 2232 is about 150 mjy .",
    "no significant structure is seen in this point - like calibrator .",
    "a bright calibrator , nrao530 ( = j1733 - 1304 ; ma et al .",
    "1998 ) , was also scanned every 120 minutes as a delay and bandpass calibrator .",
    "each observation was made for about 6 hours , but total scan time for the targeted source pair was only about 2.5 hours because we observed not only g5.89 - 0.39j1755 - 2232 pair but also another maser ",
    "calibrator pair alternately .",
    "we will describe another source pair in forth coming paper .",
    "left - handed circular polarized signals were quantized at 2-bit sampling and filtered with the vera digital filter unit @xcite , after that , data were recorded onto magnetic tapes at a data rate of 1024 mbps .",
    "there were 16 if channels with 16 mhz band width where one if was assigned to the maser lines and other 15 if of total 240 mhz were assigned to j1755 - 2232 and nrao530 .",
    "the data correlation was performed with the mitaka fx correlator @xcite .",
    "correlated data were divided into 512 and 64 spectral channels for the maser and calibrators , respectively . for the maser lines ,",
    "the full 16 mhz data were used only in the fourth epoch , and in other cases , we used 8 mhz which is covering whole maser emissions to achieve sufficient velocity resolution ( 0.21 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "the system noise temperatures were depended on weather conditions in each station and elevations .",
    "typical @xmath10 value at a averaged elevation angle was varied 200 to 500 k for each station in a case of normal weather .",
    "sometimes it exceeded 1000 k in a bad case for ogasawara and ishigaki station .",
    "there was very high @xmath10 value ( @xmath14 5000 k ) at iriki station in the first epoch , and hence , we performed phase - referenced imaging using other three stations in this epoch .",
    "phase - referenced images of the targeted maser source were successfully obtained in 8 epochs without the final epoch , where significant phase fluctuations were still remained after the fringe fitting for j1755 - 2232 , and then , all maser spots were completely defocused .",

    "data reduction was carried out using the nrao astronomical imaging processing system ( aips ) package .",
    "amplitude and bandpass calibrations were made for the targeted maser and j1755 - 2232 independently .",
    "we calibrated clock parameters for each station using the residual delay of nrao530 .",
    "the tropospheric zenith delay offset was also calibrated by the modified delay - tracking data which were calculated based on the actual measurements of the atmospheric zenith delay with the global positioning system ( gps ) at each station @xcite .",
    "there were two different paths of the analysis depending on a purpose .",
    "the one was phase - referencing ( or 2beam ) analysis for a measurement of the annual parallax and another was single - beam analysis which was suitable for searching all maser spots and studying internal motions of them . here",
    ", the term maser spot indicates a maser component seen in a single velocity channel , and by contrast , the term maser feature represents physical gas clump which is consist of several maser spots which are detected in successive velocity channels and closely located each other .",
    "we define it in the same way as @xcite .    in the single beam analysis",
    ", we simply performed fringe fitting and self - calibration using the brightest maser spot in the feature o1 ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "we then searched for all maser spots by a wide - field mapping under a 7-@xmath15 detection limit .",
    "total explored area was 5 @xmath20 5 arcsec@xmath22 of each channel map centered on the ionizing star in g5.89 - 0.39 .",
    "annual aberration was also corrected for several masers which were significantly distant ( @xmath23 3@xmath24 ) from the phase - referenced maser spot in this analysis , .    in the phase - referencing analysis ,",
    "fringe fitting and self - calibration for j1755 - 2232 were done , and then , obtained delay , rate and phase solutions were applied to the target visibilities following the correction of measured instrumental phase difference between the two beams ( see above ) .",
    "the modified delay - tracking mentioned above was re - calculated with respect to each maser feature for accurate position measurement .",
    "new delay - tracking center was always located within 10 mas from relevant maser feature .",
    "the coherence in phase - referenced images were still significantly degraded at this stage .",
    "because of the low brightness and large separation angle of j1755 - 2232 , and the low elevation angle during observations , significant atmospheric zenith delay residuals , which is a main cause of the coherence loss , still remain .",
    "we , therefore , estimated and corrected this residuals with the image optimizing method described in honma et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008b ) .",
    "estimated residuals were found to be within @xmath253 cm in whole epochs ( @xmath14 1.5 cm on average ) .",
    "this is consistent with a typical case seen in vera observations @xcite .",
    "the dynamic ranges ( or signal to noise ratios ) of phase - referenced images showed dramatic improvement with this correction .",
    "but , even after this improvement , limited coherence and defocusing made several faint spots undetectable .    after these calibrations , synthesized image cube was finally made with all maser features in both analyses .",
    "each cube had a field of view of 25.6@xmath2025.6 mas@xmath22 centered on relevant feature .",
    "imaging and deconvolution ( clean algorithm ) was done in uniform weighting which provided the highest spatial resolution .",
    "the synthesized beam was about 2.2@xmath200.9 mas@xmath22 with the position angle of -20@xmath5 .",
    "typical image noise level was @xmath14 400 mjy beam@xmath13 ( 1-@xmath15 ) in the case of the single - beam analysis ( see table [ tb : obs ] ) .",
    "it was significantly increased in phase - referenced case by a factor of 2 or 3 , and up to 10 in the worst case .",
    "the absolute and relative positions of each maser spot were determined by an elliptical gaussian fitting .",
    "the formal error in this fitting was typically 50 @xmath4as in ra and 100 @xmath4as in dec .",
    "this value is approximately equal to a uncertainty of relative positions between each maser spots .",
    "overall discussion about the accuracy of absolute positions in each measurement is given in section 4.2 .",
    "there were two strong maser features ( feature o1 and c6 in section 4.3 ) successively detected for 8 epochs in phase - referenced maps .",
    "we measured their absolute motions referenced on j1755 - 2232 .",
    "these motions can be expressed by the sum of the annual parallax @xmath26 and proper motion of each feature @xmath4 .",
    "the latter is usually assumed to be a linear and constant motion for simplicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this seems to be applicable for our case , because the relative proper motion between two features are actually fitted by a linear motion ( see section 4.3 and figure [ fig : inmotion ] ) and the drifts of their line of sight velocities are well negligible ( @xmath27 0.2 km s@xmath13 ) during the two years .",
    "a least square fitting was made with @xmath26 plus @xmath4 to the right ascension offsets ( @xmath28 ) from the first epoch .",
    "we performed our fittings in the same way as @xcite . here , whole detected maser spots in each feature ( 7 maser spots per feature ) were distinctly used and an initial position of each maser spot , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , was included as a fitting parameter .",
    "reduced @xmath31 was calculated as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 were the degree of freedom and a fitting weight for each data point , respectively .",
    "we adopted a dynamic range of phase - referenced image ( dn ) as a fitting weight , since it was a rough measure of the coherence loss caused by residual delay which was difficult to estimate directly .",
    "a weight for @xmath35th data point was to be @xmath36 @xmath37 and scaled to make the total reduced @xmath31 to be @xmath14 1 .",
    "if we assume the normal distribution , @xmath38 is equal to the error variance of @xmath35th data point .",
    "figure [ fig : parallax ] shows the examples of the parallax measurement for g5.89 - 0.39 .",
    "note that only a linear proper motion was fitted to the declination offsets ( @xmath39 ) , since g5.89 - 0.39 was located on the ecliptic plane ( @xmath40 - 0.6@xmath5 ) , where the parallax in the declination degenerated into an order of 10 @xmath4as .",
    "it is just comparable with the maximum accuracy of vera s dual beam astrometry @xcite and hard to detect . in each figure , the associated error bars indicate @xmath38 values .",
    "the @xmath41 were well fitted by a linear motion ( dashed line ) and parallax ( solid curve ) , by contrast , large dispersion from the best - fit linear motion is clearly seen in cases of @xmath42 .",
    "the error in @xmath42 ( @xmath140.9 mas ) is , in fact , much larger than that in @xmath41 ( @xmath14 0.4 mas ) as well as several other observations with vera ( e.g. , hirota et al .",
    "detailed analysis about these errors is given in next subsection .",
    "table [ tb : parallax ] presents a summary of these fittings .",
    "presented @xmath15 values are rms deviations of post - fit residuals which are good measures of typical error for each measurement . because both of the feature o1 and c6 seem to be associated with a single uch@xmath2 region",
    ", we can assume that they show the same annual parallax within the astrometric accuracy of vera .",
    "thus , the best - fit annual parallax was estimated as @xmath26 = 0.78 @xmath25 0.04 mas , corresponding a distance of 1.28@xmath43 kpc from the sun , by the weighted - means of those for the two features .",
    "one can see that some data points do not included within 1-@xmath15 error range in figure [ fig : parallax ] .",
    "this can be due to inequable data quality in each observing epoch .",
    "we have , hence , performed bootstrap analysis to test such an effect , where data for each maser spot have been randomly resampled 10000 times and a least square fitting has been iteratively done for each dataset .",
    "obtained frequency distributions of @xmath26 have been well fitted by gaussian .",
    "detailed parameters are presented in table [ tb : bootstrap ] . resultant error of @xmath25 0.05 mas is slightly larger than that of simple fittings but almost consistent with it , and we finally take it as conclusive 1-@xmath15 error of our parallax measurement . we also emphasize that even if we adopt 3-@xmath15 error ( @xmath44 99 @xmath45 confidence ) , equivalent distance range is still significantly nearer than previously reported values .",

    "this can be seen especially in @xmath42 fitting , where residual variance is about 850 @xmath4as .",
    "we again note that the parallax in @xmath42 degenerated into negligible order because of the source location .",
    "this fact suggests that @xmath42 fluctuations from a simple linear motion directly reflect a degree of actual error in each position measurement .",
    "one of the main source of this error is thought to be atmospheric zenith delay residuals as discussed in several studies with vera ( e.g. , sato et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "we first check this in our case using the several expressions in @xcite .",
    "they assumed the error in station positions and image quality of phase - referenced map as additional error sources .",
    "the former is only about 7 @xmath4as with the separation angle of 1.92@xmath5 and baseline error of 3 mm which is the typical value for vera .",
    "this is , of course , negligible in our case .",
    "the latter can be expressed by a relevant beam size in @xmath41 and @xmath42 direction divided by a dynamic range of image .",
    "the beam position angle are almost parallel to the @xmath42 direction in our observation , and then , expected error is 80 @xmath4as in @xmath41 and 200 @xmath4as in @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "an error caused by atmospheric zenith delay residual is proportional to a difference of signal path length between 2 beams divided by a relevant baseline length .",
    "this can be calculated from an atmospheric zenith delay residual , typical zenith angle and separation angle of the sources ( see equation ( 1 ) in nakagawa et al .",
    "if we adopt a residual of 3 cm as a upper limit in our case and average zenith angle of 65@xmath5 , atmospheric error is about 330 @xmath4as in @xmath41 and 820 @xmath4as in @xmath42 .",
    "this is almost consistent with the result of monte calro simulations in @xcite .",
    "because j1755 - 2232 looks an ideal point source , the internal structure of j1755 - 2232 does not cause significant error .",
    "if we also assume that the effect of internal structres of maser features is also negligible for simplicity , we finally gets the total error of 340 and 850 @xmath4as in each direction from the root sum square of these 3 values . as one can see , this is consistent with the standard deviation of the post - fit residuals ( see table [ tb : parallax ] ) . if differences of a separation angle , pair position angle and zenith delay residuals are taken into account , this can be roughly comparable to the value in @xcite , where the source declination is almost same in our case .",
    "however , the expected error of the parallax is estimated to be @xmath14 0.09 mas in a statistical way , here , we divide 340 @xmath4as by @xmath55 considering 8 observing epochs and 2 distinct maser features .",
    "this is clearly larger than the actual fitting errors of least square analysis ( 0.04 mas ) .",
    "this seems to indicate that the effect of the variability of maser feature structures , which we have ignored above , can not be negligible .",
    "this type of error is another important error source for vera observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it can be actually dominant error source in some cases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if we attribute dominant part of the post - fit variance to this effect , instead of the atmospheric error , expected error of the parallax can be reduced by the additional factor of @xmath56 , here @xmath57 is the number of maser spots in single feature .",
    "since both of the feature o1 and c6 are consist of 7 maser spots in our case , the conclusive error of parallax is to be @xmath58 @xmath14 0.03 mas , where the numerator of 0.33 mas is averaged value of the post - fit residual in @xmath41 .",
    "this is just comparable to the actual fitting error .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the dominant error source is the variability of maser feature structures in our case , although the contribution from atmospheric zenith delay residuals is also nonnegligible .",
    "the proportion of their contributions is , more quantitatively , to be @xmath14 2:1 , if we use averaged atmospheric delay residuals of @xmath14 1.5 cm which has been evaluated from the image optimizing method .",
    "absolute proper motions of feature o1 and c6 shown in table [ tb : parallax ] are motions respect to the sun , and hence , include the contribution of solar motion and the galactic rotation . if we assume the solar motion relative to the lsr based on the hipparcos data @xcite , the contribution of solar motion is calculated to be 0.69 mas yr@xmath13 and -1.19 mas yr@xmath13 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the contribution of the galactic rotation is estimated to be -0.04 mas yr@xmath13 and -0.07 mas yr@xmath13 based on a @xmath59 of 8.4 kpc and @xmath60 of 254 km",
    "s@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this value is well negligible and do not change in the common range of @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( 220  254 km s@xmath13 , 8.0  8.5 kpc;@xcite ) . here , we assumed flat rotation and adopted our newly determined distance of 1.28 kpc .",
    "the intrinsic proper motions of the maser features , where these two contributions are subtracted , is represented in table [ tb : prop ] .",
    "we note that these motions are still include the peculiar motion of their natal cloud and the internal motions of each maser feature .",
    "since only two features are detected in 2beam analysis , we can not divide these two components at this section , but brief presumption will be provided in section 5.2.2 based on the model fitting of the maser kinematics .",
    "additional 12 maser features were detected in the single beam analysis .",
    "all parameters of detected features are listed in table [ tb : feature ] .",
    "total 14 maser features can be divided into 4 maser sites .",
    "we name these sites as origin ( o ) , center ( c ) , north ( n ) and south ( s ) based on their positions .",
    "these four maser sites are widely spread around the uch@xmath2 region .",
    "we estimated internal proper motions relative to the phase - referenced feature o1 for the features which were detected in at least three observing epochs .",
    "figure [ fig : inmotion ] shows the example of feature c6 .",
    "their internal motion was well fitted by linear motion .",
    "estimated motions are also summarized in table [ tb : prop ] .",
    "overall distributions and proper motions of maser features are represented in figure [ fig : feature ] , where black and grey arrows show relative and converted absolute proper motions , respectively .",
    "relative positions and internal proper motions of all maser features are converted to absolute values using the position and motion of the feature o1 .",
    "the converted motion of c6 is actually coincide with the directly estimated one within the error .",
    "each of the sites o , n and s , which is located on outside of the ionized shell , contains only one or two maser features .",
    "this limited number of maser features can be related to a life time of h@xmath0o maser activity .",
    "they are generally believed to disappear along with a evolution of uch@xmath2 region ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , in attributing to a dispersion of dense gas which required to excite masers .",
    "all of these sites are associated with sio @xmath61 = 8  7 emission detected by sub - millimeter array ( sma ) @xcite .",
    "sio @xmath61 = 8  7 emission is a moderate shock tracer and frequently observed in post - shock gas which is associated with a protostellar outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a spatial relationship may indicate that h@xmath0o maser and sio emission trace same shock fronts .",
    "this is not so surprising case because h@xmath0o masers are also associated with strong outflow shock frequently ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    on the other hands , line of sight velocities of maser features in the site o and n are not consistent with that of sio emission .",
    "the velocity offsets are larger than 5 km s@xmath13",
    ". these offsets may reflect the difference of precise locations where each emission comes from .",
    "this can be simply attributed to the different excitation conditions of sio and h@xmath0o .",
    "the critical density of sio @xmath61 = 8  7 emission are @xmath62 @xmath63 10@xmath64 @xmath65 based on the database in @xcite .",
    "it is actually 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of h@xmath0o maser and comparable with pre - shock density of the maser @xcite .",
    "maser is , hence , probably excited in the most strongly compressed part such as a head part of a bow shock .",
    "emission from that region can not dominate the integrated sio emission , since such a region should have quite limited volume compared to total post - shock gas .",
    "the site c , by contrast to other site , is not associated with sio emission .",
    "there are 9 maser features and almost all of them ( 7 of 9 ) are highly variable and only detected in a single epoch .",

    "@xcite tested such an early spectral type by a model fitting of mid - infrared color ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 bands ) .",

    "although they suggested rather early o star ( @xmath27 o7 ) , the detection only at the location of feldt s star also ruled out a star earlier than o7 , because such an early type star could fully ionize whole he atoms and provide constant line ratio throughout a uch@xmath2 region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "we simply assumed that spherically - symmetric wind and then thermal pressure of ionized gas was balanced with @xmath78 per unit area .",

    "a wind velocity is generally determined by gravitational force at the launching point of a wind , and it is thought to be same order between zams and dwarf stage .",

    "mass loss rate is order of 10@xmath110 @xmath9 yr@xmath13 , and of cource , ten times larger than the value of dwarfs .",
    "one possible explanation for this excess may be larger stellar radius of very young zams star which is still under contraction . this could cause relatively weak surface gravity and might help mass loss activity .",
    "recent theoretical works in @xcite calculated detailed stellar evolution via spherically - symmetric mass accretion .",
    "they have shown that large entropy supply under high accretion rates ( @xmath44 10@xmath111 @xmath104 yr@xmath13 ) onto a proto - stellar surface prevent contraction of protostar and , at some stage , cause far large stellar radius ( @xmath14 100 @xmath112 ) .",
    "@xcite has been treated the case of cold - disk accretion , and they have suggested that expected evolution is qualitatively same as spherically - symmetric case after 10 @xmath104 .",
    "realistic mass accretion should correspond to some intermediate state between these two extreme case as they pointed out .",
    "the most important product of their evolutional track is delayed hydrogen burning .",
    "resultant young high mass ( proto-)star with large radius and limited uv photons can explain highly luminous but low - effective temperature source which has no detectable h@xmath2 region ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . if feldt s star has been just after the hydrogen ignition , the maximum accretion rate , with which the star has been evolved , is estimated to be @xmath14 10@xmath79 @xmath104 yr@xmath13 from @xmath113 based on their calculations .",
    "this assumption may mean that feldt s star is quite rare sample , but it seems to be well consistent with extraordinarily young dynamical age of uch@xmath2 region . if this is the case and we assume steady mass accretion , the time required to form feldt s star is simply @xmath14 2.5 @xmath20 10@xmath76 yr .",

    "we regarded feldt s star as a central source of ring , in turn , its mass was fixed to be @xmath122 .",
    "thus , keplerian rotation velocity depended on @xmath115 only .",
    "we performed the model fit with a standard @xmath31 fitting .",
    "first , the spatial distribution of 9 ( our detection ) + 1 ( vla detection ) maser features was fitted by @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath115 , @xmath35 , @xmath116 , and then , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 were determined from the velocity field of masers .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath118 and @xmath119 are more uncertain than @xmath120 , because there are only 2 available proper motion vectors .",

    "have been derived from an excitation analysis of the ch@xmath125cn ( @xmath61 = 12  11 ) line by @xcite , and hence , do not depend on a distance .",
    "they have found a temperature gradient in the range shown in the table .",
    "overall properties of the ionized region are not changed drastically except for the expansion velocity which is calculated from angular expansion rate of 4 @xmath25 1 mas yr@xmath13 in acw98 .",
    "even if ionized gas is in a free expansion state , its expansion velocity should be almost equal to a sound speed of ionized gas ( @xmath14 13 km s@xmath13 at 10@xmath76 k ) .",
    "this suggests that only a half of total momentum can be thermally provided and the shell must require another source of momentum input .",
    "if we attribute it to a spherically symmetric stellar wind discussed in section 5.2.1 , required time is about 1000 yr . moreover if the momentum of photons from feldt s star is added , the total momentum of the shell could be provided during @xmath83 .",
    "acw98 have determined the source distance in comparison between angular expansion rate and the line width of radio recombination lines under several assumptions about how the shell expansion contributes to the line width .",
    "now we have more accurate distance , and in turn , we can estimate a residual contribution to the line width which offsets from spherical expansion .",
    "this value is @xmath14 50 km s@xmath13 based on their analysis .",
    "this is twice as large as tangential expansion and nearly consistent with highly blue shifted oh masers in front of the shell .",
    "this highly anisotropic expansion could be explained by the idea proposed by @xcite , where an outflow from sma1 , which is the luminous dust core near feldt s star , had been going across north to south and it was disrupted after the formation of the uch@xmath2 region .",
    "if this is the case , ionization of intrinsically expanding gas within the outflow can give a plausible explanation for high velocity ionized gas , and hence , observed anisotropy .",
    "the revised properties of the outflowing gas in g5.89 - 0.39 are listed in tables [ tb : ooutflow ] and [ tb : ioutflow ] .",
    "table [ tb : ooutflow ] shows the parameters of co ( @xmath61 = 1  0 ) emission which trace the outer extended flow @xcite , and table [ tb : ioutflow ] presents that of the inner high velocity flow which has been detected in co ( @xmath61 = 3  2 ) emission @xcite .",
    "each table contains the dynamical age @xmath83 , outflow velocity ( or velocity ranges ) @xmath141 , outflow mass @xmath93 , kinetic energy @xmath94 , momentum @xmath96 , outflow rate @xmath97 , momentum rate @xmath98 and mechanical luminosity @xmath100 .",
    "we note that an effect of inclination is not corrected in these tables , although @xcite have originally assumed inclination of @xmath142 .",
    "the largest outflow in table [ tb : ooutflow ] is thought to be driven by feldt s star and extends just east  west direction ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "total mass measured from co ( @xmath61 = 1  0 ) is @xmath14 100 @xmath104 and greatly exceeds the source mass .",
    "such an extremely massive outflow is often observed toward a high mass star - forming region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of large mass is unsolved problem ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed driving mechanism of a protostellar outflow is still under discussion , however @xcite have shown that high velocity jet and molecular outflow ( hereafter called intrinsic outflows ) are distinctly driven in their mhd simulation as natural products of magnetized core collapse and mass accretion via rotating disk .",
    "this is consistent very well with a case of nearby low mass star formation , and seems to be applicable for high mass case as long as objects are formed by gravitational collapse and mass accretion .",
    "the energy source of intrinsic outflows is gravitational energy which is transformed into outflow energy mediated by magnetic fields . in this point of view",
    ", total outflow mass of intrinsic outflows can not exceed that of central object at a driving point .",
    "clearly , much of the outflow mass arises from material entrained far from the driving source .",
    "quantitatively , observations of outflows from massive young protostellar objects show that the entrained mass is on the order of 4% of the core mass surrounding the central protostar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this relation suggests that the parent core for the forming cluster containing feldt s star contained about @xmath14 2500 @xmath3 .    on the other hand , if we assume the ratio of the outflow to the accretion rate as @xmath14 10 % from theoretical works ( e.g , @xcite ) , total mass of intrinsic outflows for feldt s star is @xmath14 2.5 @xmath3 following the discussion in section 5.2.1 .",
    "this is comparable with the mass of the co ( @xmath61 = 3  2 ) outflow which traces inner hot and high velocity outflow ( see table [ tb : ioutflow ] ) .",
    "if we consider a momentum transport from the co ( @xmath61 = 3  2 ) outflow to the co ( @xmath61 = 1  0 ) outflow , required time is 2.3 @xmath20 10@xmath76 yr .",
    "this is consistent with a formation time of feldt s star estimated above and clearly larger than the dynamical age of outflow which is obtained from an extent divided by a current velocity .",
    "we note that this time scale should be a lower limit , since the mass and momentum of the co ( @xmath61 = 3  2 ) outflow is the sum of the east  west flow from feldt s star and north  south flow from sma1 .",
    "they have been unresloved in the single dish data in @xcite , and actually , significant fraction of high velocity emission arises from the latter ( see high resolution images in @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that a commonly used dynamical time underestimates actual outflow age has already been pointed out in the case of low mass objects @xcite and we suggest that it can occur in the case of too massive outflow in high mass star formation which includes large entrained mass",
    ". it should be , consequently , careful that an observationally estimated outflow rate , which often reaches 10@xmath99 @xmath9 yr@xmath13 for high mass star , is also overestimated by an order of magnitude .",
    "this looks reasonable because @xcite have predicted that large accretion luminosity must prevent steady accretion in the case of such a too large accretion rate .",
    "detailed information about a termination of high velocity inner flow is quite useful to confirm these discussions .",
    "this would be obtained from direct measurement of proper motions of outflow lobes with alma .",
    "the distance of g5.89 - 0.39 is newly estimated to be 1.28@xmath1 kpc from the annual parallax measurement with vera .",
    "this is 2/3 of the previously known value , but it is well reasonable if we take into account the small galactic longitude of @xmath14 5.89@xmath5 and recent theoretical prediction about non - circular motions of star - forming regions .",
    "\\(1 ) the ionizing star is rather later type zams than previously believed type of o5 .",
    "spectral type of o8.5 ",
    "o8 means that the uch@xmath2 region are excited by not so massive and standard o - type object .",
    "expected accretion rate is @xmath14 10@xmath79 @xmath9 yr@xmath13 based on the extremely young age of the ionized shell and detailed evolutional track of massive protostar under a high accretion rate .",
    "resultant formation time is about @xmath14 2.5 @xmath20 10@xmath76 yr in this case .",
    "\\(2 ) detected maser alignment at the o - star can be fitted by infalling keplarian ring and its inclination and position angle are also consistent with east - west orientation of the strong outflow .",
    "it seems to be trace accretion disk ( or its remnant ) and suggest remarkable youth of the o - star which is before complete evaporation of circumstellar structure .",
    "\\(3 ) reconsideration of outflow nature suggests that the large portion of outflow mass should be entrained from massive envelope .",
    "a commonly used dynamical time should significantly underestimate actual outflow age same as low mass cases @xcite .",
    "this also causes an overestimate of outflow rate by an order of magnitude .",
    "direct observation of momentum transportation from intrinsic outflow to outer entrained flow is required to confirm this .",
    "this may be able to be achieved with the proper motion measurement of outflow lobe with alma .",
