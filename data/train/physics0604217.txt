    "for colloidal dispersion systems , light scattering is a widely used technique to measure the sizes of particles . the dynamic light scattering ( dls ) technique is to measure the particle sizes from the normalized time auto - correlation function of the scattered light @xmath3 .",
    "the cumulants@xcite has been used as a standard method to obtain the ploy - dispersity of particles from the dls data . in general ,",
    "when the dls data are analyzed , the size distribution of particles is considered as a mono - disperse distribution if the logarithm of the normalized time auto - correlation function of the electric field of the light @xmath4 is consistent with a line .",
    "the poly - dispersity of the particles is obtained from the deviation between an exponentiality and @xmath4 .    in the previous work@xcite , for the particles that the number distribution is gaussian",
    ", it has been discussed that the nonexponentiality of @xmath5 is determined by the particle size distribution and scattering angle . in general , the effects of the particle size distribution are small on the deviation between an exponentiality and @xmath5 and very large on the initial slope of the logarithm of @xmath6 and the effects of the scattering angle are determined by the particle size distribution and mean particle size . under some conditions ,",
    "the nonexponentiality of @xmath5 is greatly influenced by the scattering angle .    in this work",
    ", the normalized time auto - correlation function of the electric field of the light @xmath0 that is scattered by two kinds of particles in dispersion is investigated .",
    "the results show that the logarithm of @xmath0 can be consistent with a line and many reasons can cause the deviations between an exponentiality and plots of @xmath1 as a function of delay time @xmath2 .",
    "the nonexponentiality of @xmath0 is not only determined by the particle size distribution and scattering angle but also greatly influenced by the relationship between the concentrations , mass densities and the values that the refractive index of the material expands as a function of the concentration of the two kinds of particles in dispersion .",
    "for the two kinds of dilute poly - disperse homogeneous spherical particles in dispersion where the rayleigh - gans - debye approximation is valid , the total normalized time auto - correlation function of the electric field of the scattered light @xmath0 can be written as    @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be obtained as@xcite    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    here @xmath16 is the angle between the polarization of the incident electric field and the propagation direction of the scattered field , @xmath17 is the mass concentration of particles , @xmath18 is the distance between the scattering particle and the point of the intensity measurement , @xmath19 is the density of the particles , @xmath20 is the incident light intensity , @xmath21 is the intensity of the scattered light that reaches the detector , @xmath22 is the static radius of a particle , @xmath23 is the scattering vector , @xmath24 is the wavelength of the incident light in vacuo , @xmath25  is the solvent refractive index , @xmath26 is the scattering angle , @xmath27 is the form factor of homogeneous spherical particles    @xmath28    and @xmath29 is the number distribution of particle sizes . in this work",
