    "open and metastable dynamical systems are currently very active topics of research in ergodic theory and dynamical systems . a dynamical system is called open if there is a subset in the phase space , called a _ hole _ , such that whenever an orbit lands in it , the dynamics of this obit is terminated ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a typical example of an open dynamical system is a billiard table with holes .",
    "probabilistic and topological aspects of open dynamical systems have recently been of central interest to ergodic theorists @xcite . + a dynamical system is called metastable if it has two or more stable states . for example , a system which consists of two adjacent billiard tables that are linked via a small hole in their common boundary is a metastable dynamical system .",
    "researchers have recognised that studying open dynamical systems can bring insights into the dynamics of metastable dynamical systems @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been recognised that closed systems that are metastable behave approximately like a collection of open systems : the infrequent transitions between stable states in a metastable system are similar to infrequent escapes from associated open systems @xcite . + a particularly transparent description of this phenomenon is discussed in the recent work of gonzlez - tokman , hunt and wright @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a metastable expanding system is described by a piecewise smooth and expanding interval map which has two invariant sub - intervals and exactly two ergodic invariant densities . due to small perturbations ,",
    "the system starts to allow for infrequent leakage through subsets ( also called _ holes _ ) of the initially invariant sub - intervals , forcing the two invariant sub - systems to merge into one perturbed system which has exactly one invariant density .",
    "the authors of @xcite proved that the unique invariant density of the perturbed interval map can be approximated by a convex combination of the two invariant densities of the original interval map , with the weights in the combination depending on the sizes of the holes .",
    "+ in this paper , we depart to the _ non - uniformly _ hyperbolic setting . in particular , we study an _ intermittent map _ which has exactly two ergodic invariant densities .",
    "the densities are supported on two subintervals with a common boundary point . due to certain perturbations , leakage of mass through _ holes _ of the initially invariant subintervals",
    "occurs and forces the subsystems to merge into one system that has exactly one invariant density .",
    "we prove that the invariant density of the perturbed system converges in the @xmath0-norm to a _",
    "convex combination of the invariant densities of the intermittent map .",
    "in particular , we show that the ratio of the weights in the combination equals to the limit of the ratio of the measures of the _",
    "holes_. + we would like to comment on the relationship between our work and the issue of statistical stability .",
    "the latter is usually established in the context of systems which admit a unique srb measure ( in our case an absolutely continuous invariant measure , _",
    "_ ) and which are successively perturbed and the perturbed maps posses an srb measure too .",
    "one way to formulate the statistical stability is by asking wether the perturbed density converges to the unperturbed one in @xmath0 , w.r.t .",
    "the lebesgue measure and whenever the srb measure is absolutely continuous .",
    "a general result of this kind has been established by alves and viana in the paper @xcite , and successively by alves @xcite where sufficient conditions are given to prove the statistical stability but still for the same class of maps .",
    "the latter is given by non - uniformly expanding maps which admit an induction structure with the first return map which is uniformly expanding , with bounded distortion and finally with _ long branches _ of the domains of local injectivity .",
    "the perturbed map is chosen in an open neighbourhood of the unperturbed one in the @xmath1 topology with @xmath2 , and a few more conditions are given to insure that the subsets with the same return times in the induction set are close and moreover the structural parameters of the maps ( especially those bounding the derivative and the distortion ) could be chosen uniformly in a @xmath1 neighbourhood of the unperturbed map .",
    "the main result is that when the perturbed maps converge to the unperturbed ones in the @xmath1 topology then the corresponding densities of the a.c.i.m .",
    "converge to each other in the @xmath0 norm , w.r.t . the lebesgue measure .",
    "+ there are two main differences with our situation . first our unperturbed map admits more than one a.c.i.m . ;",
    "second , the maps are only close in @xmath3 , a better regularity being restored only locally on the open domain of injectivity of the branches .",
    "these two facts obliged us to find a completely different proof .",
    "+ in section 2 we recall the result of @xcite about metastable expanding maps in a slightly more general setting . in section 3",
    "we introduce our metastable intermittent system and its corresponding induced system .",
    "we then show that the induced system satisfies the assumptions of section 2 .",
    "moreover , we prove a lemma that relates invariant densities of the induced system to those of the original one . in section 4",
    "we setup the problem of the metastable intermittent system .",
    "further , we derive the formula of the _ particular _ invariant density which is needed to approximate in the @xmath0-norm the invariant density of the perturbed system .",
