    "it is presently believed that large scale structures ( in particular clusters of galaxies ) are formed through hierarchical clustering . from this point of view",
    ", clusters are formed by merging of smaller clusters or by groups falling onto a larger cluster . however , the effect of merging is not the same if a cluster undergoes a major merger or accretes small groups or even single galaxies ( salvador - sol et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "notice that merging does not occur isotropically around a cluster .",
    "groups tend to fall onto clusters along filaments , thus explaining the preferential orientations often observed ( see e.g. west et al .",
    "1995 , durret et al .",
    "therefore the true orientation and the true ellipticity are interesting quantities to derive .",
    "the imprints of such merging events can be seen directly on the x - ray images , but also in substructures which can be detected at optical ( density maps , velocity structure ) , x - ray and radio wavelengths ; this was first noticed by baier ( 1977 ) from optical data .",
    "recent studies have revealed that about 50% of clusters show multi - component structure both in their galaxy distribution ( bird 1994 , escalera et al .",
    "1994 , west 1994 , maccagni et al . 1995 ) and in x - rays ( mohr et al .",
    "1993 , grebenev et al .",
    "1995 , west et al .",
    "1995 , zabludoff & zaritsky 1995 ) .",
    "however one may notice that , when the amount of data grows and techniques of analysis are improved , this percentage appears to grow too ( girardi et al .",
    "this leads to question the dynamical meaning of these substructures .",
    "the properties of relatively poor and cool clusters are somewhat more difficult to analyze because of their limited signal , but prove to be interesting as a link between rich clusters and groups .",
    "their relaxation time scales are larger and one can wonder if they are sufficiently virialized ( e.g. mahdavi et al . 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the properties of the x - ray emitting gas can be different from those of rich / hot clusters ( see e.g. david et al .",
    "in particular , various relations between optical and x - ray properties ( as the @xmath8 - t@xmath10 relation which seems linked to global properties ) , x - ray / x - ray relations ( as the l@xmath10-t@xmath10 relation ) or x - ray to dynamical properties ( as the x - ray gas fraction ) may differ from those of rich clusters ( mahdavi et al .",
    "1997 , markevitch 1998 , arnaud & evrard 1999 ) : they are probes to test cluster formation and evolution models , particularly the fine modeling of the gas heating ( cavaliere et al .",
    "very few low temperature clusters are included in these relations , so adding even a single cluster at the border - line is important .",
    "we present a multi - wavelength analysis of the cluster abcg 194 based on optical data taken from the literature and on x - ray data from the rosat archive , coupled with different techniques of analysis .",
    "abcg 194 is a linear cluster of richness 0 and bautz - morgan type iii ( struble & rood 1982 ) with central coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( chapman et al .",
    "1988 , hereafter cgh ) .",
    "its average redshift is 0.018 , corresponding to a heliocentric velocity of 5340 km / s , and to a spatial scaling of 1.87 mpc / degree ( h@xmath13= 50 km / s / mpc , q@xmath13= 0 ) .",
    "the velocity interval corresponding to the cluster is 4000 - 6600 km / s according to cgh , but we will show in section 4.2 that it is in fact 4300 - 6200 km / s .    we have somewhat arbitrarily divided our analysis into two scales : the global aspect at large scale , and the smaller scale features . the first description is related to the cluster as an astrophysical object by itself , while for the second description , which takes into account as much as possible the kinematics , dynamical processes are important .",
    "[ xya194 ]      our optical analysis is based on the following data :    - chapman et al .",
    "( 1988 ) have observed a list of 74 cluster member galaxies in abcg 194 ( i.e. with velocities in the 4000 - 6600 km / s range ) , located within a radius of 3@xmath14 ( 5.6 mpc ) around the cluster center . the cgh sample is 97% complete for galaxies brighter than b=16.7 in a region of radius r=30 arcmin around the cluster center , and 80% complete for galaxies brighter than b=15.5 in the entire region .    out of the 74 galaxies in this sample , 48 and 62",
    "are located within radii of 30 arcmin and 1@xmath14 of the cluster center respectively .",
    "for all these galaxies , cgh give the following data : coordinates , radial velocity , b magnitude , morphological type , major axis position angle and ellipticity .",
    "- we have added to this sample 22 optically fainter galaxies selected from the cf2+ssrs2 redshift survey , for which barton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) give positions and redshifts ( hereafter the bcg sample ) ; these authors determined that the region of 1@xmath14 radius around the abcg 194 cluster is 100% complete for galaxies brighter than m@xmath15 .",
    "for the three galaxies with numbers 15 , 30 and 54 in the cgh list , we take the radial velocity from the barton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) paper , where the error is smaller than in cgh .    -",
    "the coordinates and redshift for an additional ( seyfert ) galaxy were taken from knezek & bregman ( 1998 ) .",
    "the total sample therefore includes 97 galaxies located within the following range of positions relative to the cluster center : @xmath16x@xmath176480 and @xmath18y@xmath178710 arcsec .",
    "[ opt_x ]    [ opt_radio ]    our x - ray study is based on a rosat pspc image of abcg 194 retrieved from the rosat data bank ; the exposure time was 24482 seconds ( p.i .",
    "murray & stephens ) .",
    "this image was processed with the snowden software ( snowden et al .",
    "1994 ) . obviously , this cluster is not a strong x - ray emitter , since in spite of the relatively high exposure time the total amount of counts is 8530 , which is small .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ opt_x ] a superposition of the optical and x - ray maps , and in fig .",
    "[ opt_radio ] that of the optical and radio maps .",
    "notice that there is a zoom by a factor of @xmath193 between these two images .    in x - rays ,",
    "the signal to noise ratio is low : we give in fig .",
    "[ histopix2 ] the curves which allow to obtain the number of pixels above a certain count level .",
    "99% of the pixels contain only 1 or 2 counts ( essentially noise ) for both clusters ; however , there are much more pixels with a large number of counts ( essentially signal ) in abcg 85 than in abcg 194 .",
    "[ histopix2 ]      in the center of this cluster are located the radiosources 0123 - 016a and 0123 - 016b .",
    "the  dumbbell \" source 0123 - 016a coincides with two galaxies , one of them being ngc 547 ( 3c  40 ) , while 0123 - 016b coincides with ngc 541 ( ledlow & owen 1995 , edge & rttgering 1995 ) ; ngc 547 and ngc 541 are the first are third magnitude galaxies in the cluster respectively .",
    "the radiosource 3c  40 has a  twin jet \" structure ( burns et al .",
    "the optical disk of ngc 547 is perpendicular to the radio axis ( zirbel & baum 1998 ) and its direction coincides with that joining ngc 541 and 547 ( fasano et al .",
    "ngc 541 is a narrow - angle - tailed ( nat ) radio galaxy .",

    "orientation]b ) .",
    "the snowden method gives 38 sources in the same field , among which 9 in common with ours .",
    "the difference between the numbers of detections reached by both methods raises the question of their validity .",
    "the snowden method is based on a convolution by the psf ( which varies with radius ) , and is therefore close to the wavelet method",
    ". however , the statistics on which the detection thresholds are determined for both methods are not the same . our wavelet software estimates the image characteristic statistics by analyzing the whole image ( see e.g. slezak et al . 1994 ) while snowden considers only circles containing between 90% and @xmath25 of the encircled energy radius of the off - axis psf .",
    "the average background is taken into account only in the cases where there are less than 4 counts per annulus .",
    "this may explain the difference between the numbers of sources .",
    "note also that the purpose of both methods is not the same : snowden s software is aimed at detecting everything that is not diffuse x - ray emission , in order to eliminate these point - like sources , and therefore it tends to find a higher number of small sources ( including possible cosmic rays ) , while our purpose is to detect only x - ray sources above a certain significance level .",
    "source a corresponds to one of the two `` dumbbell '' galaxies , which are the first and third brightest cluster galaxies ; however the x - ray pspc pixel size is too large to be able to discriminate between both galaxies .",
    "source b can be identified with the second brightest galaxy in the cluster .",
    "source c coincides with the seyfert galaxy reported by knezek & bregman ( 1998 ) .",
    "the radiosources 0123 - 016ab are also strong x - ray emitters ( burns et al .",
    "note that these sources have velocities in the cluster .",
    "source f appears to be a star ( it is star - like in the poss and there is no quasar at this position in the vron - cetty & vron 1993 catalogue ) . the other sources do not coincide with any galaxies with available redshifts .",
    "note that in the part of the x - ray field shown in fig .",
    "[ orientation]b , we detect all the sources reported by lazzatti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) except one ( their source 26 ) .",
    "we have estimated the x - ray luminosity of the nine detected sources , proceeding in three steps :    * we fit the whole data by a @xmath26-model as explained in section 3.2 ; * we subtracted to the real image the synthetic image corresponding to the values obtained by the fit ; * in the image thus obtained , we have counted the photons around the peaks corresponding to the detected sources and give the corresponding results in table  5 ; we have checked that outside the sources the background is around zero , as expected ; * the luminosities were derived from the counts assuming a temperature of 1 kev , following the method described in section [ xana ] .",
    "the luminosities found for these sources are much lower than those given by lazzati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but the reason for such a discrepancy is not clear . we have compared our source counts with the results given by the rosat sass data processing pipeline , and find that they agree within 35% except for sources b and c. note that the specific @xmath26-model used for this estimate is not very important .",
    "we have presented a morphological and structural analysis of abcg 194 both at optical and x - ray wavelengths . from dynamical and velocity dispersion studies ,",
    "we are left with a sample of 91 galaxies really belonging to the cluster ( 4200 - 6100 km / s ) , the mean cluster velocity being 5326 km / s with a standard deviation of 360 km / s .",
    "this value coupled with the temperature of 2.6 kev determined for this cluster from asca data falls on the @xmath8-t@xmath10 relation ( wu et al .",
    "1998 ) . the main underlying structure ( 53 galaxies )",
    "has the same mean velocity but a standard deviation of 300 km / s .",
    "the x - ray map shows an ellipticity similar to that observed in the optical .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of abcg 194 is @xmath27erg s@xmath28 , and falls notably below the l@xmath9-t@xmath9 relation for clusters ( markevitch et al .",
    "1998 , arnaud & evrard 1999 ) , i.e. this cluster is underluminous for its temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the cluster is within the dispersion of the l@xmath9-@xmath8 relation ( mahdavi et al .",
    "the @xmath26-model fit to the x - ray gas gives @xmath29 , which appears larger than expected from the low value of the x - ray gas temperature ( arnaud & evrard 1999 ) .",
    "a @xmath26-model fit to the galaxy density distribution also gives values of @xmath26 consistent with 1 , as in the enacs sample ( adami et al . 1998 ) .",
    "abcg 194 appears therefore to be a very poor cluster , comparable to those recently studied by mahdavi et al . ( 1999 ) , as confirmed by the stellar , x - ray gas and dynamical masses which we have calculated .    the number of counts in angular sectors from the x - ray @xmath26-model center ( fig .",
    "[ sectorx ] ) shows priviledged directions along the major axis pa found in x - ray and optical analysis , but also along an axis perpendicular to this one . except for individual sources ,",
    "no x - ray substructures are found with a wavelet analysis .",
    "only 9 x - ray sources are found with our method , while 38 are detected with the snowden software .",
    "the various analyses described above show that at large scale abcg 194 is overall a relaxed cluster , with a few superimposed groups : the velocity distribution of the `` main '' relaxed underlying cluster is not far from gaussian . however , both at optical and x - ray wavelengths , a bright linear structure is observed in the central part , and emission is much stronger south east of this line than north west .",
    "this central structure is well defined dynamically and is also rich in radio and x - ray galaxies .",
    "we can try to interpret these results in the framework of hierarchical structure formation . as suggested by numerical simulations such as those by tormen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the time interval between two possible major mergings is large compared to the timescale of violent relaxation .",
    "the cluster therefore has time to relax between two mergers .",
    "this is also the interpretation proposed for detailed features observed for example in the coma cluster ( biviano et al .",
    "we suggest that in abcg 194 a group around the bright elliptical galaxy ngc 547 may have merged into the cluster ; due to dynamical friction , this group has stopped near the cluster center and was disrupted ( gonzlez- casado et al .",
    "the galaxy excess towards the south east could then be a remnant of this group .",
    "abcg 194 therefore appears as one of the very few poor clusters which are well studied at various wavelengths .",
    "such objects are intermediate cases between rich clusters and groups , and as such are interesting to compare the physical processes taking place in these objects , which may be influenced by the very different relaxation timescales of these various systems .",
    "we are very grateful to the franco - armenian pics and jumelage for making our collaboration possible through financial support for three stays of e.n . in france .",
    "we gratefully thank dario fadda and eric slezak for giving us their wavelet analysis programmes , and christophe adami for performing a @xmath26-model fit to our data .",
