    "supersymmetric models with weak scale supersymmetric matter are very compelling for a variety of reasons , most important of which is that they solve the gauge hierarchy problem@xcite .",
    "however , it is safe to say that a compelling model for supersymmetry breaking has yet to emerge . supergravity models based on susy breaking in a hidden sector@xcite can give rise to weak scale soft susy breaking ( ssb ) terms with susy breaking communicated via gravitational interactions .",
    "however , there exists no compelling mechanism in supergravity to suppress the generation of non - universal ssb parameters that lead to unacceptably large flavor violation , sometimes in @xmath8-violating processes .",
    "alternatively , in models with gauge mediated susy breaking@xcite , universality of scalars with the same quantum numbers occurs naturally , but at the expense of the introduction of a messenger sector which acts to communicate susy breaking to the visible sector .",
    "another intriguing alternative is anomaly - mediated susy breaking , an extra dimensional model wherein susy breaking on one brane is communicated to the visible sector brane via the superconformal anomaly@xcite .",
    "the form of the scalar masses again allows a solution to the susy flavor ( and @xmath8 ) problems .",
    "alas , the minimal version of this model leads to tachyonic slepton masses , although the tachyons can be exorcized in a variety of proposals@xcite .",
    "an interesting alternative , also based on extra dimensions , is known as gaugino - mediated susy breaking ( inomsb)@xcite . like amsb models , one postulates the existence of both hidden and visible sector branes , spatially separated in an extra dimensional world .",
    "however , gauge superfields ( and perhaps also higgs superfields ) are allowed to propagate in the bulk . upon compactification of the extra dimensions ,",
    "a tree level ssb gaugino mass is generated , but all scalar masses and @xmath9 ( and perhaps @xmath10 ) terms are only generated at the loop level , and so are suppressed , and can be justifiably set to zero at the compactification scale .",
    "the gravitino can be made heavier than the gauginos ; it then decouples and plays no role in our considerations .",
    "compactification is assumed to occur at or beyond the gut scale , thus preserving the successful unification of gauge coupling constants@xcite .",
    "thus , at the compactification scale , we expect @xmath11 which are the same boundary conditions that arise in no - scale models@xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is taken equal to the gut scale , then evolution of soft susy breaking parameters leads in general to the tau slepton being the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , a result in conflict with cosmological considerations , since then the present day universe would be filled with charged relics , for which there exist stringent limits . a way out , proposed by schmaltz and skiba@xcite ,",
    "is that @xmath12 , and that above @xmath2 some four - dimensional gut gauge symmetry is valid , such as @xmath3 or @xmath13 . in this case , the additional beyond - the - gut - scale rge running leads to large enough slepton masses at @xmath2 that regions of parameter space exist @xcite with a neutralino lsp , in accord with cosmological constraints .    in the minimal gaugino mediation model , the bilinear ssb term @xmath14 . by minimizing the scalar potential of the mssm at the weak scale ,",
    "the weak scale value of @xmath10 is related to the parameter @xmath15 .",

    ", the assumption of a gut theory above @xmath2 frequently implies relations amongst the yukawa couplings of the theory , especially for the third generation .",

    "we adopt the computer program isajet v7.58  @xcite for calculating rg evolution . starting with @xmath21 fermion masses and gauge couplings at the weak scale ,",
    "isajet calculates an iterative solution to the relevant set of rges of the mssm by running between the weak and @xmath22 scales . to test yukawa coupling evolution , it is imperative to include susy loop corrections to fermion masses at the weak scale@xcite",
    ". it has been found that a high degree of @xmath23 yukawa coupling unification at @xmath24 can occur only for values of @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , a high degree of @xmath27 yukawa unification only occurs for @xmath28 and @xmath29@xcite .",
    "we adopt the criteria of yukawa coupling unification as being more fundamental than the generation of tiny gut scale values of @xmath10 , so that @xmath15 ( and the sign of @xmath30 ) are free parameters , although they are highly constrained by the requirement of @xmath31 unification .    in this paper",

    "we have conservatively restricted our analyis to @xmath158 smaller than 300  gev , because for larger values of this cut parameter , the estimates of the sm backgrounds may have considerable statistical fluctuations .",

    "[ lhc5 ] , the reach with @xmath173 gev is found to be essentially the same as that for the @xmath163 channel .",

    "in this paper we have addressed the question of discovery reach for susy breaking models with gaugino mediated susy breaking .",

    "we found that the fermilab tevatron has _ no reach _ for sparticles in the inomsb model .",
    "this occurs for several reasons .",
    "first , gluinos and squarks are beyond the reach of the tevatron .",
    "second , charginos and neutralinos dominantly decay to third generation leptons and sleptons , and taus are more difficult to detect that @xmath107s and @xmath30s .",
    "moreover , the lower limit on parameter space implies @xmath85 gev , so there is not a lot of sparticle production cross section to begin with . finally , since @xmath178 at the lower values of allowed @xmath0 ,",
    "the stau decays give rise to very soft visible decay products , reducing greatly the efficiency to detect signals including hadronic taus .    on the other hand",
    ", the cern lhc has a substantial reach for inomsb models . in this case",
    ", we expect gluino and squark pair production to dominate , so that a variety of cascade decay signals will be present if @xmath0 is not too large .",

    "if gluinos are lighter than @xmath179 ( 2000 )  gev , there should be confirmatory signals also in the os , ss and @xmath146 channels .",
    "these reach values are comparable to expectations within the msugra framework , which is not surprising in that the sparticle mass spectra for the two models are not that different .",
    "although we have performed our analysis assuming that there are no higgs fields in the bulk , we expect that our conclusions about the lhc reach will be qualitatively unchanged even if this is not the case .",
    "the reason is that gaugino and scalar masses for the first two generations are insensitive to our boundary condition @xmath180 .",
    "we also expect that our estimates of the susy reach of the lhc are insensitive to the couplings in the @xmath22 higgs sector .",
    "the question then arises whether the inomsb and msugra models can be differentiated by collider experiments .",
    "the main spectral difference between the two models arises due to the non - universal gut scale scalar masses arising in the inomsb model .",
    "most noticeably , the splitting between the @xmath90 and @xmath91 of @xmath3 gives rise to heavier right - sleptons and lighter left - sleptons in the inomsb model compared to msugra with a similar overall spectrum ( see table  [ tab : cases ] ) .",
    "differentiation of the two models is a very difficult task to accomplish at the cern lhc .",
    "however , a method has recently been proposed to differentiate models with gut scale scalar mass non - universality from the msugra framework at @xmath7 linear colliders@xcite .",
    "these authors have proposed that the measurable quantity @xmath181 , \\label{delta}\\ ] ] could be used to differentiate the two classes of models .",

    "the difference is sufficiently large so that the two models should be distinguishable via precision measurements at a linear @xmath7 collider where chargino and selectron masses can be determined to about 1 - 2% .    in conclusion , if nature has chosen to be described by inomsb model with an @xmath3 gauge symmetry above the gut scale , then we may expect a susy higgs boson discovery at the luminosity upgrade of the tevatron , but no sign of sparticles .",
    "conversely , we would expect a susy discovery at the cern lhc ( unless sparticle masses are so heavy they are in the fine - tuned region of susy parameter space , with @xmath189 gev ) .",
