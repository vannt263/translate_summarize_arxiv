    "measurements of heavy quark production in proton - proton ( @xmath3 ) interactions at collider energies serve as important tests for perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "bottom production at the tevatron collider ( @xmath6 and 1.96tev / c )  @xcite is reasonably well described by a recent fixed order next - to - leading logarithm ( fonll ) calculation  @xcite .",
    "charm production at fnal , which has only been measured at relatively high @xmath4 ( @xmath7gev / c ) , is @xmath8 50% higher than the fonll prediction  @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical and experimental uncertainties are large , such that significant disagreement between theory and data can not be claimed .",
    "measurements at brookhaven national laboratory s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , by both the phenix and star experiments , have provided a wealth of information on mid - rapidity open charm production in collisions at @xmath9gev ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath10gev ( @xmath3 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) down to @xmath13gev / c .",
    "semileptonic decay of produced charm quarks is the primary source of high @xmath4 leptons after contributions from known ( light hadron ) sources are subtracted .",
    "both phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite have made statistical measurements of charm production via single - electron spectra .",
    "star has also made a direct measurement of charm production through reconstruction of hadronic decay modes of @xmath14 mesons  @xcite . in @xmath3 collisions at @xmath15gev phenix",
    "finds @xmath16 mb  @xcite .",
    "star finds a somewhat higher central value , @xmath17 mb  @xcite , but the two measurements are consistent within the stated errors .",
    "both measurements are noticeably ( 2 - 4@xmath18 ) higher than pythia ( a leading order pqcd event generator )  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see experimental references for specific parameter sets ) and fonll  @xcite .",
    "again , quantitative disagreement can not be established with current experimental and theoretical errors .",
    "however , we note that there is some debate about whether charm quarks are heavy enough to be reliably treated by pqcd  @xcite",
    ".    such measurements also serve as an important baseline for charm production in proton - nucleus or deuteron - nucleus ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) , and nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath21 ) collisions  @xcite . in the absence of any nuclear effects ,",
    "charm production ( since it is a point - like process ) is expected to scale with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath22 ) , which depends on the impact parameter of the nuclear collision and can be obtained from a glauber calculation  @xcite .",
    "the degree of scaling for any given centrality bin is quantified by the nuclear modification factor : @xmath23 deviations from this scaling ( @xmath24 ) in @xmath19 or @xmath20 collisions quantify cold nuclear matter effects ( such as initial state energy loss  @xcite , and shadowing  @xcite ) .",
    "any such deviation must be understood so that in @xmath21 collisions contributions to @xmath24 from hot nuclear matter effects ( such as in - medium energy loss  ( * ? ? ? * and",
    "references therein ) ) and cold nuclear matter effects can be disentangled . in @xmath11 collisions",
    "both phenix and star find little or no effect of cold nuclear matter on charm production ( @xmath25 over the measured lepton @xmath4  @xcite ) .",
    "this contrasts with measurements of open charm in @xmath12 collisions : although the _ total _ charm production appears to scale with @xmath22  @xcite , there is a strong suppression of lepton spectra for @xmath26gev / c that increases with centrality  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the elliptical flow of non - photonic single electrons , as measured by phenix in @xmath12 collisions  @xcite , implies that the charm quarks interact strongly with the created medium .",
    "finally , since the initial formation of open and closed charm are both sensitive to initial gluon densities  @xcite , open charm production serves as an appropriate normalization for @xmath27 production .",
    "the production of @xmath27 mesons is expected to be sensitive to the production of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , should one be formed in @xmath21 collisions  @xcite . in order to understand @xmath27 production differences in @xmath21 collisions",
    "compared to @xmath3 and @xmath19 collisions it is important to take into account any differences in the charm quark production in each of the different systems .    until now , open charm measurements at rhic have been limited to mid - rapidity .",
    "measurements at forward rapidity are interesting for a variety of reasons .",
    "first is the need to constrain theoretical calculations over a wide kinematic range .",
    "the importance of this is demonstrated by the d0 measurement of bottom production at large rapidity ( @xmath28 tev , @xmath29gev / c , @xmath30 ) , as deduced from the production of high @xmath4 muons  @xcite .",
    "significant theoretical improvements resulted from the effort to reduce what was , initially , a discrepancy between theory and experiment that increased with increasing rapidity  @xcite .",
    "second , significant cold nuclear effects have been seen in rhic collisions at forward rapidity .",
    "phenix  @xcite , brahms  @xcite , and star  @xcite have all measured light hadron production in @xmath11 collisions at forward rapidity and have found significant deviations from @xmath31 .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether charm production follows a similar pattern .",
    "finally , open charm production at forward rapidity needs to be understood to fully interpret phenix @xmath27 measurements at forward rapidity  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on the measurement of muon production at forward rapidity ( @xmath0 ) , in the range @xmath32gev / c , in @xmath2gev @xmath3 collisions by the phenix experiment .",
    "the upper limit of the @xmath4 range is determined by available statistics .",
    "the vertex - independent muon yield is statistically extracted by calculating and subtracting contributions from light mesons ( @xmath33 s and @xmath34 s ) which decay into a muon , and hadrons which penetrate through the muon arm absorber material . in the absence of new physics , and in the @xmath4 range measured in this analysis , such muons come dominantly from the decay of hadrons containing a charm quark ( with small contributions from decays of hadrons containing a bottom quark and decays of light - vector mesons ) .",
    "pythia is used to determine the charm quark spectrum that would produce the observed vertex - independent muon spectrum , and from this we obtain the differential cross section of charm quark production at forward rapidity .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : experiment ] we describe the phenix experimental apparatus , with special emphasis on the muon arm detectors . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we describe the methodology used to extract the vertex - independent muon signal .",
    "this section includes details on the run , event and track selection criteria ; values obtained for contributions to the muon yield from abundant light hadrons , which are subtracted to obtain the vertex - independent muon yield ; and details on the systematic error analysis . in section  [ sec : xsec ] we extract the differential cross section for charm production at @xmath35 , integrated over @xmath4 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we compare to other measurements , draw conclusions , and discuss the prospects for such measurements with improved data sets currently under analysis .",
    "the phenix experiment  @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : expfig ] , is a large multipurpose set of detectors optimized for measuring relatively rare electromagnetic probes ( photons , muons , and electrons ) of the spin structure of the proton and of the hot dense matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the data acquisition system and multilevel triggers are designed to handle the very different challenges presented by @xmath3 collisions ( relatively small events at very high rates ) and @xmath12 collisions ( very large events at relatively low rates ) with little or no deadtime  @xcite .",
    "event characterization devices , such as the beam - beam counters  @xcite used in this analysis , provide information on the vertex position , start time , and centrality of the collision .",
    "the two muon arms cover @xmath36 in pseudorapidity and @xmath37 in azimuth .",
    "the two central arms , which each cover @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are not used in this analysis .",
    "the beam - beam counters ( bbcs )  @xcite each consist of 64 quartz radiators instrumented with mesh dynode pmts and arranged in a cylinder coaxial with the beam .",
    "the bbcs are placed on either side of the collision vertex and cover @xmath40 .",
    "each channel has a dynamic range extending to 30mips .",
    "the bbcs measure the arrival times of particles on both sides of the collision vertex , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . from the average of these times",
    "we determine the event start time . from their difference",
    "we obtain the position of the vertex along the beam direction , @xmath43 .",
    "the bbcs also provide the minimum bias interaction trigger , which requires that there be at least one hit in each bbc and that @xmath44 cm .",
    "the muon arms  @xcite are coaxial with the beam on opposite sides of the collision vertex . by convention the arm on the south ( north ) end of the interaction region",
    "is assigned negative ( positive ) @xmath45 coordinates and rapidity . for the 2001/2 run period , in which the data for this paper were collected ,",
    "only the south muon arm was operational .",
    "each muon arm is comprised of a muon tracker ( mutr ) and a muon identifier ( muid ) . the mutr makes an accurate measurement of particle momenta .",
    "the muid allows coarse resolution track reconstruction through a significant amount of steel absorber .",
    "together the muon arm detectors provide significant pion rejection ( @xmath46 , increasing with decreasing momentum ) through a momentum / penetration - depth match .    before ever reaching the mutr detectors",
    "a particle must pass through the pre - mutr absorber : 20 cm of copper ( the nosecone ) plus 60 cm of iron ( part of the mutr magnet ) .",
    "the nominal nuclear interaction lengths of iron and copper are @xmath47 cm and @xmath48 cm ( although this varies with particle species and energy , see section  [ sec : punch ] ) .",
    "therefore the pre - mutr absorber presents a total thickness of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the polar angle of a particle s trajectory .",
    "this absorber greatly reduces the mutr occupancy and provides the first level of pion rejection .",
    "each mutr arm consists of three stations of cathode strip chambers installed in an eight - sided conical magnet  @xcite .",
    "the radial magnetic field ( @xmath51t@xmath52 m at 15 degrees , @xmath53 ) bends particles in the azimuthal direction .",
    "each station occupies a plane perpendicular to the beam axis and consists of multiple ionization gaps ( 3 gaps for the two stations closest to the collision vertex , 2 gaps for the last station ) which have their charge imaged on two cathode strip planes oriented with a small stereo angle to provide two - dimensional information .",
    "an ionizing particle typically fires three adjacent strips in each orientation .",
    "a fit to the charge distribution on adjacent strips provides a position measurement with a resolution of @xmath54 m in the bend direction .",
    "the mutr achieves a momentum resolution of @xmath55 over the analyzed kinematic range .",
    "the resolution is approximately independent of momentum due to the significant contribution from energy loss fluctuations in the pre - mutr absorber , which falls as @xmath56 , and which counters the more familiar linear momentum dependence seen for particles tracked through a `` thin '' detector .",
    "each muid arm consists of five steel absorber plates interleaved with iarocci tubes ( operated in proportional mode ) and specialized shielding to reduce backgrounds not originating from the collision vertex .",
    "gaps are labeled 04 proceeding downstream from the collision point .",
    "the iarocci tubes , which are between 2.5 and 5 m in length , have eight 1@xmath57 square cells , each consisting of a three - sided ground electrode and an anode wire , mounted inside a pvc gas enclosure . a readout channel ( `` two - pack '' ) is formed by wire - oring the 16 anode wires of two tubes which are mounted in planes perpendicular to the beam axis and staggered by half of a cell width ( 0.5 cm ) .",
    "this provides redundancy , eliminates geometric inefficiency due to the cell walls , and reduces the maximum drift time for charge collection .",
    "digital readout of the two - pack signals provides a coarse one - dimensional hit position ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the tubes in each gap are mounted in six individual panels , each of which contains two layers of two - packs ( horizontally and vertically oriented ) , thus providing two - dimensional information .",
    "the first muid absorber plate ( thickness = 20 cm - south ; 30 cm - north ) also serves as the return yoke of the mutr magnet .",
    "successive plates ( identical for the two arms ) are 10 , 10 , 20 and 20 cm thick , thus totaling @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) for the south ( north ) arm . due to ionization energy loss",
    "a particle must have a momentum at the vertex which exceeds @xmath61gev / c ( @xmath62gev / c ) to penetrate to the most downstream muid gap of the south ( north ) arm .",
    "steel plates surrounding the beam pipe guard against backgrounds caused by low - angle beam - beam collision products which scrape the beam pipe near the muid @xmath45-location ( 7 - 9 m ) or shine off the rhic dx magnets immediately downstream of each muid arm .",
    "steel blocks in the rhic tunnels guard against penetrating radiation generated by the incoming beams scraping against beamline components ( primarily the final focusing quadrupoles ) .",
    "the muid also contributes information to the first - level trigger decision . for the 2001/2 run , during which the data for this analysis were collected",
    ", a relatively coarse trigger was implemented using lecroy 2372 memory lookup units ( mlus ) .",
    "each gap was divided into quadrants with a horizontal and vertical split going through the beam axis .",
    "signals from tubes in an individual gap / orientation ( layer ) and quadrant were logically combined . only gaps 0,2,3 and",
    "4 were used in the trigger due to the 16-bit input limitation of the mlus .",
    "the penetration depth required for the trigger to fire was programmable .",
    "the _ muid-1deep _ trigger fired if more than 6 out of 8 layers in a particular quadrant were hit ( indicating the possibility that the event contained a particle penetrating to muid gap 4 ) .",
    "muid-1shallow _ trigger fired if 3 of the 4 most shallow layers ( horizontal and vertical layers in gaps 0 and 2 ) were hit for a particular quadrant .",
    "inclusive muon candidates , @xmath63 , are those particles which are successfully reconstructed to the last muid gap ( gap 4 ) . these consist of four components : 1 ) ``",
    "free - decay muons '' , @xmath64 , which result from the decay of light hadrons ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 mesons ) before reaching the pre - mutr absorber , 2 ) `` punchthrough hadrons '' , @xmath65 , which penetrate the entire detector and are thus misidentified as muons 3 ) `` background tracks '' , @xmath66 , which in @xmath3 collisions are dominated by hadrons which decay into a muon after reaching the mutr , and 4 ) `` vertex - independent muons '' , @xmath67 , which are primarily due to the decay of heavy flavor mesons .    figure  [ fig : penetration ] shows a schematic depiction of the relative yield per event of these different contributions as a function of flightpath into the muon arms , as described below .",
    "the number of hadrons is large and essentially independent of flightpath until the first absorber layer is reached . in each absorber layer",
    "these hadrons undergo strong interactions with a probability @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the length of absorber material traversed , and @xmath70 is the species and @xmath4-dependent nuclear interaction length determined in section  [ sec : punch ] .",
    "most of these interacting hadrons are effectively eliminated as possible muon candidates . however , a small fraction of hadrons penetrate the entire absorber thickness .",
    "these punchthrough hadrons are indistinguishable from muons .    the decay lengths for @xmath33 s ( c@xmath71 cm ) and @xmath34 s ( c@xmath72 cm ) are long compared to the flightpath from the vertex to the absorber .",
    "therefore , the fraction of decay muons from these sources is relatively small , but increases linearly with the flightpath until the first absorber layer is reached .",
    "a hadron which decays prior to the pre - mutr absorber into a muon that is inside the detector acceptance is indistinguishable from a muon originating at the vertex .",
    "after the first absorber layer the number of free - decay muons remains constant by definition .",
    "hadrons which decay in the mutr volume are a relatively small contribution since most are absorbed prior to reaching the mutr , the lorentz - dilated decay lengths are long compared to the length of the mutr volume ( south @xmath73 cm , north @xmath74 cm ) , and a particle which decays in the mutr is less likely to be reconstructed .",
    "such tracks are partially accounted for in the calculation of punchthrough hadrons ( see section  [ sec : punch ] ) and the remaining fraction falls under the category of background tracks ( section  [ sec : back ] ) .",
    "this small contribution is not shown .    without a high - resolution vertex detector muons from various sources ( the decay of open heavy flavor hadrons ,",
    "the decay of quarkonia , the decay of light vector mesons , and drell - yan production ) originate indistinguishably close to the collision vertex .",
    "thus their yield is independent of the flightpath and independent of the vertex position . since inclusive muon candidates , by definition ,",
    "penetrate to muid gap 4 , we measure the combined yield at @xmath75 cm .",
    "distribution of different components of the inclusive muon candidate yield ( measured data for both charge signs over the range @xmath76gev / c ) .",
    "crosses show inclusive muon candidates , filled circles show free - decay muons , open circles show punchthrough hadrons , open squares show background tracks , and open diamonds show the sum of these three hadronic sources .",
    "the vertex - independent muon yield is obtained from the difference between the yield of inclusive muon candidates and the yield of light hadronic sources . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : composition ] shows a sample distribution of the inclusive muon candidate yield as a function of collision vertex ( @xmath43 ) , and its decomposition into the four different contributions .",
    "the yield of free - decay muons is seen to have a linear dependence that is set to 0 at @xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath78 cm is the upstream face of the pre - mutr absorber ( indicated by the thick solid line ) , and @xmath79 is the effective absorption length , beyond which there are no free - decay muons .",
    "@xmath79 was found to be nearly identical to the species and @xmath4-dependent nuclear interaction lengths determined in section  [ sec : punch ] .",
    "muons originating from meson decays downstream of this location have no @xmath43 dependence .",
    "the fraction not accounted for in the calculation of the punchthrough hadron yield forms the small contribution from background tracks .",
    "the yield of punchthrough hadrons and vertex - independent muons also have no @xmath43 dependence .",
    "note that the ratio of different contributions to the inclusive muon candidate spectrum is @xmath4 dependent .    in order to extract the cross section for charm production",
    "we first need to determine the yield of vertex - independent muons , @xmath80 , the amount beyond that due to light hadrons and fake backgrounds . as described in section  [ sec : datareduction ] , we select good runs , events , and tracks , and restrict our acceptance to regions where the detector performance was optimal , and the acceptance vs.  @xmath43 was nearly constant .",
    "next , as described in sections  [ sec : acceff ] and  [ sec : inclus ] , we obtain the yield of inclusive muon candidates vs.  @xmath4 and @xmath43 , corrected for acceptance and efficiency : @xmath81 . in section  [ sec : cocktail ] we describe a data - driven hadron generator .",
    "this generator is used in section  [ sec : decay ] , in which we describe how the vertex dependence of the inclusive muon candidate yield allows us to obtain the yield of muons from light - meson decay before the pre - mutr absorber , similarly corrected and binned : @xmath82 .",
    "this generator is also used in section  [ sec : punch ] , in which we describe how we use hadrons which stop in muid gap 3 ( the penultimate gap ) , together with simulations of hadron penetration in the muid absorber , to obtain the yield of punchthrough hadrons in muid gap 4 : @xmath83 .",
    "the yield of fake tracks , @xmath84 , determined from simulations described in section  [ sec : back ] , is found to be small .",
    "the yield of vertex - independent muons is determined by subtracting the contributions from light hadrons and fake backgrounds and averaging over @xmath43 bins :    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is implicit in all terms of the equation .",
    "we convert this into a cross section via @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the cross section of the bbc trigger for @xmath3 interactions and @xmath89 is the efficiency of the bbc trigger for events in which a charm quark is created and decays into a muon .",
    "substituting @xmath90 introduces negligible error due to the small mass of the muon , the only component left after the subtraction . as described in section  [ sec : syst ] , systematic errors are determined for each component and combined into a term that applies to the overall normalization and a term that applies to the @xmath4 dependence of the spectrum .",
    "we use pythia to derive the @xmath4-dependent differential cross section for the production of charm quarks responsible for the vertex - independent muon yield .",
    "this procedure is very similar to that in references  @xcite , and is described in detail , along with the associated systematic error analysis , in section  [ sec : xsec ] .",
    "runs were selected for this analysis based on stable detector operation using the same criteria as an earlier analysis of @xmath27 production  @xcite .",
    "further runs were eliminated due to the presence of large beam - related backgrounds entering the _ back _ of the detector .",
    "we select only those events in the vertex range @xmath91 cm .",
    "this minimizes the @xmath43 dependence of the detector acceptance and allows us to treat the amount of absorber material as a simple function of polar angle , ignoring complications in the pre - mutr absorber near the beampipe .",
    "the decision to collect an event was made by the local level-1 trigger  @xcite within 4@xmath92s of the collision .",
    "input to the trigger decision was given by the bbc ( collision with a valid event vertex ) and the muid ( reconstructed penetrating track ) .",
    "each trigger could be independently scaled down , so that it occupied a predetermined fraction of the available bandwidth , by selecting every @xmath93 instance , where @xmath94 is the scaledown factor for the @xmath95 trigger .",
    "three different data sets were selected from the good runs for different aspects of the data analysis :    * _ bbc _ : to extract @xmath64 we need to measure the @xmath43 dependence of @xmath63 .",
    "for this we need the unbiased collision vertex distribution , which we obtain from a set of events collected with the _ bbc _ trigger : @xmath96 cm , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the number of hits in the north and south bbc respectively .",
    "@xmath99 was found to be @xmath100 mb using a van der meer scan  @xcite .",

    "one way to visualize this is to plot ( see figure  [ fig : pythia_muon_shapes ] ) the vertex - independent muon yield in our acceptance _ per event in which a @xmath116 pair is created _ for the different pythia parameter sets . due to our procedure ,",

    "the systematic uncertainty in the data is dominated by uncertainty on the determination of the fractional contribution of decay muons .",

    "data sets ( already collected ) with higher statistics , and with hadrons stopping in muid gap 2 , will allow a completely data - driven approach to the calculation of the punchthrough yield .",
    "this will eliminate the reliance on hadronic interaction simulation packages , differences in which are the largest source of systematic error at high @xmath4 .",
