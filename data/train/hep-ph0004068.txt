    "the experimental discovery of the higgs boson is crucial for the understanding of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the search for higgs particles is one of the main goals for the lep2 and tevatron experiments and is one of the major motivations for the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) and linear @xmath0 collider ( lc ) .",
    "once the higgs boson is discovered , it will be of primary importance to determine in a model independent way its tree - level and one - loop induced couplings , spin , parity , @xmath1-nature , and its total width . in this respect the @xmath2 compton collider @xcite option of the lc offers a unique opportunity to produce both standard model ( sm ) higgs boson and neutral higgs states @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) or general two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite as @xmath6-channel resonance decaying into @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 : @xmath11 the ability to control the polarizations of back - scattered photons @xcite provides a powerful means for exploring the @xmath1 properties of any single neutral higgs boson that can be produced with reasonable rate at the photon linear collider @xcite .",
    "@xmath1-even higgs @xmath12 bosons @xmath13 , @xmath14 couple to the combination @xmath15 while a @xmath1-odd @xmath16 higgs boson @xmath17 couples to @xmath18\\cdot\\vec{k_\\gamma}= \\frac{\\omega_\\g}{2}i\\lambda_1 ( 1+\\lambda_1\\lambda_2 ) ,   \\label{pseudoscalar}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are photon polarization vectors and helicities .",
    "the first of these structures couples to linearly polarized photons with the maximal strength if the polarizations are parallel , the letter if the polarizations are perpendicular . moreover , if the higgs boson is a mixture of @xmath1-even and @xmath1-odd states , as can occur _",
    "e.g. _ in a general 2hdm with @xmath1-violating neutral sector , the interference of these two terms gives rise to @xmath1-violating asymmetries @xcite .",
    "since mssm higgs particles @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath17 decay predominantly into @xmath7 or @xmath10 quark pairs depending on the mass of the higgs boson , the heavy quark pair background in @xmath2 collisions has been studied in great detail .",
    "one - loop qcd corrections were calculated for the photon helicity states corresponding to projection of total angular momentum on beam axes @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "virtual one - loop qcd corrections for @xmath21 were found to be especially large due to the double - logarithmic enhancement factor , so that the corrections are comparable or even larger than the born contribution for the two - jet final topologies @xcite . in order to solve this theoretical problem leading qcd corrections for @xmath21",
    "have been calculated at the two - loop level @xcite and recently these leading double - logarithmic qcd corrections were resummed to all orders @xcite .",
    "the account of non - sudakov form factor to higher orders makes the @xmath21 cross section well defined and positive definite in all regions of the phase space @xcite .",
    "all these studies of the influence of qcd corrections on heavy quark production in @xmath2 collisions were concentrated on circularly polarized initial photons . however , for the direct measurements of the parity of states of higgs bosons , ( [ scalar]-[pseudoscalar ] ) , linear polarization of photon beams is needed @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the qcd corrections to heavy quark - antiquark pair production in photon - photon collision for the general case of initial photon polarizations .",
    "we mainly concentrate on qcd corrections for linearly polarized photon - photon collisions .",
    "the production cross sections and spin asymmetries for @xmath10-pair production are calculated for linearly polarized photon collisions .",
    "the measurement of spin asymmetries is necessary to determine the @xmath1 parity of the higgs boson . in the scattering of linearly polarized photon off circularly polarized ones at one - loop level _ azimuthal _",
    "asymmetries arise in the production of heavy fermion pairs .",
    "this is a pure quantum effect which does not exist at the born level .",
    "these type of asymmetries are suppressed by factor @xmath23 , @xmath6 is the c.m.s energy of colliding photons , and are sizeable only for @xmath10-pair production .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we recall the basic definitions and consider the born cross section of heavy quark - antiquark pair production in polarized photon collisions .",
    "calculations of virtual corrections are presented in section 3 .",
    "the real gluon emission part is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the numerical results for top - antitop pair production cross sections and expected asymmetries for linearly polarized photon beams are discussed in section 5 .",
    "the cross section of heavy quark - antiquark pair production in polarized photon - photon collision @xmath24 can be written in the most general form using the stokes parameters which describe the polarizations of initial photons .",
    "the covariant density matrix of polarized photon with arbitrary polarization can be written in the following form @xmath25 here @xmath26 are three stokes parameters describing polarization of the photon with momentum @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote ort vectors in @xmath30 and @xmath31 directions .    the momenta of the particles involved in the reaction in the c.m.s . of the initial photons",
    "are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the photon beam energy and @xmath34 is the quark ( antiquark ) velocity .    with this definitions ,",
    "the born cross section of heavy quark pair production in photon - photon collisions has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath6 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are mandelstam variables for the process under consideration , @xmath39 in the above formulae instead of the original stokes parameters their combinations are used .",
    "the expressions of the cross sections are shorter and more convenient for integration if one includes the dependence on the azimuthal angle in the stokes parameters , @xmath40 .",
    "they can be expressed by original stokes parameters through the equations : @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "parameters @xmath40 describe photon polarization with respect to unit vectors @xmath43 , @xmath44 , where @xmath43 lies in the reaction plane and @xmath44 is orthogonal to the reaction plane .",
    "the first order qcd corrections to the cross section are determined by the interference between the tree level and one - loop diagrams . at the one - loop level",
    "no three - gluon vertex enters and the calculation is analogous to calculations of qed corrections to compton scattering for finite electron mass ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the calculations of virtual corrections were done by using the symbolic manipulation program form @xcite . to regularise the infrared singularities we introduced an infinitesimal mass of the gluon @xmath45 . in the basis of the stokes parameters the one - loop corrections have the form @xmath46 in addition to the born level expression , eq .",
    "2 , there is the new term proportional to the non - diagonal product @xmath47 , which corresponds to the scattering of linearly polarized photon on the circularly polarized one .",
    "the functions @xmath48 can be expressed through scalar one - loop integrals @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    here @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the definitions and expressions for the scalar integrals are given in the appendix a of @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that all functions @xmath48 are expressed through four- and three - point functions and ultraviolet finite combinations of two - point functions .",
    "the contribution of the real gluon emission to the total cross section is separated in two parts , soft gluon emission which cancels out the infrared divergences of virtual corrections and hard gluon emission .",
    "the cross section of the soft gluon emission can be reproduced in a factorized form as a product of born level cross section and the infrared divergent factor : @xmath61 where @xmath62\\ln{\\frac{2k_c}{\\lambda } } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2\\beta}\\biggl(1-\\frac{2m_q^2}{s}\\biggr ) \\biggl[{\\rm sp}\\biggl(\\frac{-2\\beta}{1-\\beta}\\biggr)-{\\rm sp}\\biggl(\\frac{2\\beta}{1+\\beta}\\biggr)\\biggr ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2\\beta}\\ln{\\frac{1+\\beta}{1-\\beta}}\\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath63 is the soft photon energy cut and the velocity @xmath64 is defined in section 2 .",
    "the dependence on the gluon mass @xmath45 is exactly canceled while adding soft gluon emission part and virtual corrections for any sets of stokes parameters . as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ born ] ) and ( [ virt ] ) the term proportional to the product @xmath65 appears only in the virtual part and therefore should be infrared finite , although one - loop scalar functions @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 do contain infrared logarithms . one can easily check that infrared divergent contributions from these scalar functions cancel each other in the @xmath69-term of eq .",
    "the hard gluon emission part is also calculated using form program .",
    "the expressions for the squared matrix elements are lengthy and we do not reproduce them in the paper . the integration over three - particle phase space is done by using monte - carlo integration routine vegas @xcite . after adding the soft and hard gluon emission cross sections the final numerical results do not depend on the imposed energy cut of emitted gluon , @xmath63 .",
    "special care is taken to handle sharp peaks of the cross section while the gluon is soft or is emitted along the quark or antiquark three momenta ( see detailed discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "these peaks correspond to the infrared and collinear singularities in the case of massless fermions and in our case become essential when mass of quark is small compared to the c.m.s .",
    "energies of photons . to arrange the infrared and collinear singularities along the integration axis we take the gluon energy , denominator of the quark propagator , polar angles of quark and antiquark and azimuthal angle of reaction as integration variables .",
    "integration over azimuthal angle is necessary in the case of linearly polarized photons , as in this case the cross section does depend on the @xmath42 angle .",
    "the infrared singularity lies on the axis of integration over gluon energy , whereas collinear singularities are located along the axis of quark propagator .",
    "there are also additional peaks when quark or antiquark are produced at zero angle with respect to the beam direction .",
    "such singularities are treated by integration over the polar angles of quark and antiquark .",
    "as was mentioned above , the helicity cross sections @xmath70 , @xmath71 for the heavy quark pair production in the circularly polarized photon - photon collisions were considered in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we mainly present numerical results for the production of heavy quark - antiquark pair for the linearly polarized photons .",
    "we consider two cases of linear polarizations of initial photons , when @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the angle between the directions of polarization vectors of the photons . the @xmath75 correspond to the collision of linearly polarized photons with parallel and perpendicular polarizations , respectively .",
    "for the measurements of the higgs boson parity it is necessary to consider collisions of linearly polarized photons in order to measure the polarization asymmetry @xcite @xmath76    l7.cm    in fact if inclusive two - jet final states are studied then after averaging over azimuthal angles and spins of the final particles only three independent cross sections remain for arbitrary polarization states of initial photons .",
    "these independent cross sections can be taken as @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "for the study of the higgs boson signal in photon - photon collisions @xcite it was essential that the background from @xmath80 quark production is suppressed by a factor of @xmath81 for @xmath21 at the born level .",
    "however at the next - to - leading order the cross section of the @xmath82 production for @xmath21 is not suppressed any more .",
    "therefore experimental cuts selecting only two - jet final states were important to suppress the @xmath82 background @xcite . in this section",
    "we show , that the difference of @xmath79 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath23 even at the next - to - leading order .",
    "the cross section for heavy quark pair production can be cast in the form @xcite : @xmath83    . @xmath84 for different polarization states of the photons as a function of dimensionless parameter @xmath85 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     where the functions @xmath86 depend on the dimensionless variable @xmath87 only .",
    "the numerical values of the functions @xmath88 are presented in the figure 1 and table i. because of the sommerfeld rescattering correction , the function @xmath89 is nonzero at the threshold , as one can see from the table i. in the both cases , @xmath72 and @xmath90 , the functions corresponding to qcd corrections are positive and rising at high energies . taking the average of values of these two functions one obtains the corresponding function for the unpolarized cross section .",
    "our results are in agreement with previous calculations of qcd corrections for heavy quark - antiquark production in unpolarized photon - photon collisions @xcite . as in the case of born level functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 , in the asymptotic regime the difference between @xmath93 and @xmath89 vanishes and each of the function tends to the unpolarized one , @xmath94 .",
    "such an asymptotic behavior of the corrections can be understood considering the helicity amplitudes for massless quarks .",
    "the difference of the cross sections with parallel and orthogonal polarized photons can be expressed via the interference term of the following helicity amplitudes @xmath95    l7.cm    here",
    "the sum over the helicities of the final state particles @xmath96is implied .",
    "the born amplitude of the @xmath97 pair production in the photon - photon collisions is known to vanish like @xmath23 for equal photon helicities and massless quarks @xcite .",
    "therefore first two terms in the eq .",
    "19 vanish in the high energy limit .",
    "in addition , helicity amplitudes for the process of massless @xmath97 pair production with the additional gluon emission @xmath98 identically vanish for photon and gluon helicities @xmath99 and arbitrary quark helicities @xcite . consequently , in the third term of the eq",
    ". 19 amplitudes @xmath100 and @xmath101 are nonzero only in the case when emitted gluons have different polarizations .",
    "therefore there is no interferention between corresponding amplitudes and third term of eq .",
    "19 term also vanishes at high energies . as result , the difference of the cross sections for @xmath102-pair production , @xmath103 is suppressed by a factor of @xmath104 . for @xmath7 production",
    "the relative difference of the cross section for parallel and orthogonal polarized photons is less than @xmath105 for @xmath106 gev , i.e. in the whole range of the plc energies . on the other hand , for top - antitop production",
    "there is no strong suppression of @xmath107 by the mass of quark at energies @xmath108 gev .",
    "the production cross sections for @xmath10-pair production are illustrated in the figure 2 for different helicity states of initial photons .",
    "the usual cut for suppression the higgs background is imposed , @xmath109 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the born level cross sections and the dashed lines to the qcd corrected ones .",
    "as one can see from figure 2 the corrections are large near the threshold and decrease very rapidly with increasing the photon - photon c.m.s energy , @xmath110 .    in the figure 3a",
    "the difference of two cross sections , @xmath111 , is shown .",
    "the correction to the @xmath107 are rather large near the threshold , up to @xmath112 gev , and decreases rapidly . however , the asymmetry , @xmath113 gets only small corrections in the whole range of energies .",
    "the _ azimuthal _ asymmetry of heavy quark pair production is the specific effect which occurs only at one - loop level . the relevant term in eq . 8",
    "proportional to imaginary unit @xmath114 corresponds to the scattering when one photon is polarized linearly and the other circularly , @xmath115 and @xmath116 or other way round ( all other stokes parameters are zero ) .",
    "this term gives the contributions with opposite signs to the cross section being integrated in two different ranges of azimuthal angle , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the value @xmath119 corresponds to the direction of polarization vector of linearly polarized photon .",
    "it is obvious that the total contribution of @xmath69-term to the cross section is zero .",
    "we define the _ azimuthal _ asymmetry of @xmath102-pair production in the linearly polarized photon scattering off circularly polarized one in the following way @xmath120 this asymmetry can be sizeable only for top - antitop production at plc energies , while for the @xmath7-pair production _ azimuthal _",
    "asymmetries are also suppressed by factor @xmath121 .",
    "the expectations for the @xmath10-pair production asymmetry are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the effect is @xmath122 at energies of the plc .",
    "in the presented paper we derived the compact expressions for the @xmath123-corrections to the squared matrix element @xmath124 for the general case of initial photon polarizations .",
    "the total cross sections up to the order @xmath125 are calculated , which are given by the sum of the tree level cross section , contribution of the interference term between the qcd one - loop @xmath123-correction and tree level amplitude and tree level cross sections of quark pair production accompanied by the real gluon emission .",
    "the numerical results are obtained for heavy quark pair production cross sections in the case of linearly polarized photon collisions .",
    "the difference of the cross sections of heavy quark pair production for parallel and perpendicular polarized photon collisions is suppressed by factor @xmath23 .",
    "we show that the qcd correction for the @xmath7 production asymmetry is less than @xmath105 in the whole energy range of the plc and practically does not change the background for the measurement of @xmath1 parity of higgs boson . at the same time",
    ", there is no such suppression for top - antitop production due to the large mass of top quark .",
    "the relevant cross sections for @xmath126-pair productions are calculated .",
