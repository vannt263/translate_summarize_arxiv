    "given the meridian on a knot exterior , it is easy to reconstruct the knot . first one can glue a @xmath4-disk @xmath5 to the meridian in a unique way",

    "the knot is then recovered as the spine of this newly glued - in solid torus . with this discussion",
    "the knot complement problem reduces to the question , in how many different ways one can glue a solid torus to the boundary of a knot exterior to get @xmath2 back , which is nothing but the existence question of cosmetic dehn surgeries .    here",

    "next , i recall the definition of contact dehn surgery along transverse knots . roughly speaking one cuts out the neighborhood of a transverse knot and glues a contact solid torus back in a different way to obtain a new contact @xmath0-manifold .",

    "<S> we study cosmetic contact surgeries along transverse knots in the standard contact @xmath0-sphere , i.e. contact surgeries that yield again the standard contact @xmath0-sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is that we can exclude non - trivial cosmetic contact surgeries ( in sufficiently small tubular neighborhoods ) along all transverse knots not isotopic to the transverse unknot with self - linking number @xmath1 .    as a corollary it follows that every transverse knot in the standard contact @xmath0-sphere is determined by the contactomorphism type of any sufficiently big exterior . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we give counterexamples to this for transverse links in the standard contact @xmath0-sphere and for transverse knots in general contact manifolds . </S>"
