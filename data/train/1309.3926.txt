    "irreducible nonsingular @xmath0-matrices are one class of the most important matrices from applications , such as discretized pdes , markov chains abate94,rober90 and electric circuits @xcite , and have been studied extensively in the literature ; see , for instance , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) . in many applications ,",
    "one is interested in finding the smallest eigenvalue @xmath2 and the associated eigenvector @xmath3 of an irreducible nonsingular @xmath0-matrix @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath0-matrices are closely related to nonnegative matrices .",
    "for instance , an @xmath5-matrix @xmath6 can be expressed in the form @xmath7 with a nonnegative matrix @xmath8 and some constant @xmath9 , the spectral radius of @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is nonnegative . for more properties and a systematic account of @xmath0-matrices and nonnegative matrices ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "nonnegative matrices have important applications in many areas @xcite , including economics , statistics and network theory . for a nonnegative matrix @xmath10 ,",
    "at least one of the eigenvalues of maximal magnitude is nonnegative and hence equal to the spectral radius @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath3 satisfy @xmath13 and are called the perron vectors of @xmath10 if they are nonnegative .",
    "the nonnegative @xmath10 always has at least one perron vector . in applications ,",
    "the perron vectors play an important role , and they describe , e.g. , an equilibrium , a probability distribution or an optimal network property @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath10 is irreducible , then the perron - frobenuis theorem  hjo85 states that @xmath14 is simple and there is a positive eigenvector @xmath3 associated with @xmath14 .",
    "one is often interested in verifying the uniqueness and strict positivity of the perron vector of the irreducible nonnegative matrix @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the well - known pagerank vectors are special perron vectors of very large google matrices whose largest eigenvalues are equal to one @xcite . from the relation @xmath7 , we see that the smallest eigenvalue @xmath15 of the irreducible nonsingular @xmath0-matrix @xmath6 is simple and equal to @xmath16 , and the positive vector @xmath3 is the unique associated eigenvector up to scaling . consequently , if @xmath17 is available , then the computation of the smallest eigenpair @xmath18 of @xmath6 amounts to that of the largest eigenpair of @xmath10 .    for a general large and sparse @xmath6",
    ", there are a number of general numerical methods for computing a small number of its eigenpairs .",
    "krylov type methods including the power method applied to @xmath6 directly are suitable for exterior eigenvalues , i.e. , some eigenvalues close to the exterior of the spectrum , and the associated eigenvectors , but they face serious challenges when the desired eigenvalues are in the interior of the spectrum .",
    "many methods , such as inverse iteration , rayleigh quotient iteration ( rqi ) and shift - invert arnoldi , have been developed to overcome these difficulties ; see saa92,par98,ste01 .",
    "however , they require the solution of a possibly ill - conditioned large linear system involving a shifted @xmath6 , called inner linear system , at each iteration .",
    "this is generally very difficult and even impractical by a direct solver since a factorization of a shifted @xmath6 may be expensive or prohibited .",
    "when inner linear systems are approximately solved by iterative solvers , we are led to inner - outer iteration methods , also called inexact eigensolvers .",
    "the inner iteration means that the inner linear system at each step is approximately solved iteratively , while the outer iteration is the update of the approximate eigenpair(s ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we always make the underlying hypothesis that a direct solver is not viable for large sparse linear systems and only iterative solvers can be used .    there has been ever growing and intensive interest in inexact eigensolvers over last two decades . among them , inexact inverse iterationlll97,bgs06,liu12 and inexact rqi @xcite are the simplest and the most basic ones .",
    "in addition , they are often key ingredients of other sophisticated and practical inexact methods , such as inverse subspace iteration @xcite , the jacobi  davidson method svo96,ste01 and the shift - invert residual arnoldi method @xcite . in the mentioned papers and the references therein as well as some others , a number of theoretical results have been established on these methods .",
    "particularly , it has been shown @xcite that , different from rqi , the inexact rqi generally does not converges globally , rather it is only locally convergent by requiring that the initial vector is a reasonably good approximate eigenvector .",
    "because of these two reasons , the inexact rqi is seldom used in practice unless a good initial guess to the desired eigenvector is already available .    for the computation of the perron vector of the nonnegative @xmath10 and the eigenvector of the @xmath0-matrix @xmath6 associated with the smallest eigenvalue ,",
    "a central concern is how to preserve the strict positivity of approximate eigenvectors . for nonnegative matrices and @xmath0-matrices ,",
    "such positivity is crucial in some applications since if all the components of an approximate eigenvector do not have the same sign then it may be physically meaningless and could not be interpreted .",
    "unfortunately , all the methods but the power method mentioned previously are not structure preserving and can not guarantee the desirable positivity of approximations since it is possible that a converged approximation of @xmath3 may well have negative components , as is the typical case when the unit length @xmath3 has very small components .",
    "theoretically , the power method fits into this purpose for nonnegative matrices and naturally preserves the strict positivity of approximate eigenvectors , provided that the starting vector is positive .",
    "due to the equivalence of nonnegative matrix and @xmath0-matrix eigenproblems , the power method can be adapted to computing the smallest eigenpair of an irreducible nonsingular @xmath0-matrix .",
    "however , the power method , though globally convergent , is generally very slow and may be impractical .",
    "therefore , it is very appealing in both theory and practice to develop both efficient and reliable positivity preserving numerical methods for the nonnegative matrix and @xmath0-matrix eigenproblems .",
    "we will devote ourselves to this topic in this paper .",
    "in @xmath19 , noda @xcite introduced an inverse iteration method with variable shifts for nonnegative matrix eigenvalue problems .",
    "this iteration method is a structure preserving method and was motivated by the works of collatz @xcite in 1942 and wielandt @xcite in 1950 ; see ( * ? ? ? * and 59 ) ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite for a description and historic overview .",
    "however , it was noda who proposed its inverse iteration form with the variable shifts different from rayleigh quotients .",
    "we , therefore , call the iteration the noda iteration ( ni ) . given a positive starting vector ,",
    "ni naturally preserves the strict positivity of approximate eigenvectors at all iterations .",
    "it has been adapted to computing the smallest eigenpair of an irreducible nonsingular @xmath0-matrix xue96,axy02 .",
    "the purpose of @xcite is to compute the smallest eigenvalue of such @xmath0-matrix with high relative accuracy .",
    "there , it has been shown that ni is practical and effective for such a pursue , in which the linear systems involved are solved accurately by a special direct solver , called the gth like algorithm .",
    "it is well known that rqi is almost always globally convergent for any starting vector ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.9.1 ) , but its correct convergence to a desired eigenpair is conditional and requires that the initial vector be a reasonably accurate approximation to the desired eigenvector @xcite . as a result ,",
    "rqi itself is seldom used to solve a practical problem unless a good initial guess is available .",
    "in contrast , a major advantage of ni is that , for any positive initial vector , it converges globally and computes the desired eigenpair correctly .",
    "furthermore , the convergence order of ni is asymptotically superlinear @xcite and actually quadratic @xcite .",
    "as it will become clear , ni always generates a monotonically decreasing sequence of approximate eigenvalues whose convergence to @xmath14 is guaranteed ; for the smallest eigenvalue @xmath2 of the irreducible nonsingular @xmath0-matrix @xmath6 , it always generates a monotonically increasing sequence of approximate eigenvalues that converge to @xmath2 unconditionally . in other words ,",
    "the approximate eigenvalues converge to @xmath14 from above or converge to the smallest eigenvalue of the @xmath0-matrix from below .",
    "in contrast , for symmetric matrices , rayleigh quotients always reside in the spectrum interval . as a result ,",
    "if rqi converges correctly , the sequence of approximations approach the perron root of the nonnegative matrix and the smallest eigenvalue of the @xmath0-matrix from inside to outside .    in this paper , keep in mind that only iterative solvers are supposed to be viable to solve inner linear systems approximately .",
    "based on ni , we first propose an inexact noda iteration ( ini ) to find the perron root and vector of an irreducible nonnegative matrix @xmath10 . as an inexact eigensolver ,",
    "our major contribution is to propose two practical inner tolerance strategies for solving the inner linear systems involved , so that the resulting two ini algorithms are structure preserving and globally converge .",
    "the first inner tolerance strategy uses @xmath20 as a stopping criterion for inner iterations with the constant @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the current positive approximate eigenvector .",
    "the second inner tolerance strategy solves the inner linear systems with certain decreasing tolerances for inner iterations , which will be described in the context .",
    "we establish a rigorous convergence theory of ini with these two inner tolerance strategies , proving that the convergence of the former iteration is globally linear with the asymptotic convergence factor bounded by @xmath23 and that of the latter is asymptotically superlinear with the convergence order @xmath1 , respectively . in order to derive this superlinear convergence order",
    ", we establish a close relationship between the eigenvalue error and the eigenvector error obtained by ni and ini , which is interesting in its own right .",
    "we also revisit the convergence of ni and establish a new quadratic convergence result different from that in @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the ini algorithms developed and the theory established are easily extended to the computation of the smallest eigenpair of an irreducible nonsingular @xmath0-matrix @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we stress that , different from @xcite , our aim is the positivity preserving computation of the desired eigenvectors , while their concern is the relative high accuracy computation of the perron root and the smallest eigenvalue of an @xmath0-matrix .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we introduce ni and some preliminaries . in section  3 ,",
    "we present an inexact noda iteration and prove some basic properties of it . in section  4 , we propose two practical ini algorithms , called ini_1 and ini_2 , respectively , for computing the spectral radius and the perron vector of an irreducible nonnegative matrix .",
    "we then establish their global convergence theory .",
    "moreover , we precisely derive the asymptotic linear convergence factor of ini_1 and superlinear convergence order of ini_2 . in section  5 , we adapt ini_1 and ini_2 to the computation of the smallest eigenvalue and the corresponding vector of an irreducible nonsingular @xmath0-matrix and present their convergence theory . in section  6 , we report the numerical results on a few practical problems to justify the convergence theory of ini and illustrate their effectiveness .",
    "we also compare ini with the jacobi  davidson method @xcite , the implicitly restarted arnoldi method @xcite and the explicitly restarted krylov ",
    "schur method ste02 , all of which are not positivity preserving .",
    "the experiments indicate that the proposed ini algorithms always preserve the positivity of approximate eigenvectors , while the other three methods often fail to do so .",
    "also , we demonstrate that the ini algorithms are efficient , competitive with and can outperform the other three methods considerably . finally , we summarize the paper with some concluding remarks in section  7 .",

    "<S> the positivity of approximations is critical in applications , and if the approximations lose the positivity then they may be meaningless and could not be interpreted . </S>",
    "<S> we propose two different inner tolerance strategies for solving the inner linear systems involved , and prove that the convergence of resulting ini algorithms is globally linear and superlinear with the convergence order @xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed ini algorithms are structure preserving and maintains the positivity of approximate eigenvectors . </S>",
    "<S> we also revisit the exact noda iteration and establish a new quadratic convergence result . </S>",
    "<S> all the above is first done for the problem of computing the perron root and the positive perron vector of an irreducible nonnegative matrix and is then adapted to computing the smallest eigenpair of the irreducible nonsingular @xmath0-matrix . </S>",
    "<S> numerical examples illustrate that the proposed ini algorithms are practical , and they always preserve the positivity of approximate eigenvectors . </S>",
    "<S> we compare them with the jacobi  davidson method , the implicitly restarted arnoldi method and the explicitly restarted krylov  </S>",
    "<S> schur method , all of which can not guarantee the positivity of approximate eigenvectors , and illustrate that the overall efficiency of the ini algorithms is competitive with and can be considerably higher than the latter three methods .    </S>",
