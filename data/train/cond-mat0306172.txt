    "the equilibrium properties of magnetized quantum electron gases are partly determined by physical processes near its boundaries .",
    "for instance , the landau diamagnetic effect of a magnetized free - electron gas is a result of currents flowing near the edge @xcite .",
    "hence , it is important to study the influence of a wall on both the static and the dynamic behavior of these systems . in a recent paper @xcite we investigated the static correlations in a fully degenerate magnetized free - electron gas in the vicinity of a wall . in the bulk the decay of the pair correlation function for large separations depends on the orientation of the position difference : for directions orthogonal to the field it is exponentially fast , whereas it is algebraic for directions parallel to the field .",
    "if a hard wall parallel to the field is present , the picture changes : the asymptotic behavior of the pair correlation function for transverse directions changes from exponential to algebraic for any two positions close to the wall .",
    "further insight in the influence of a wall on the correlation properties is obtained by studying dynamical correlations , which are the subject of the present paper . in the bulk",
    "these time correlations yield , after suitable fourier transforms , the dynamic structure factor , which has been studied quite extensively for various systems , both theoretically and experimentally . for an unmagnetized degenerate free - electron gas its properties",
    "were determined several decades ago @xcite .",
    "the generalization to finite temperatures is available as well @xcite .",
    "the dynamic structure factor for a magnetized degenerate free - electron gas is somewhat more complicated , as it involves a sum over landau levels .",
    "if a wall is present as well , the translation invariance of the system is lost , so that taking a fourier transform is inconvenient . instead",
    ", it is more suitable to analyze the dynamical correlations by means of the structure function in configuration space .",
    "we will focus on its time dependence , and , in particular , on its decay for large time . as a starting point",
    "we shall employ the expansion of the space - time - dependent structure function in terms of the single - particle eigenfunctions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we shall define the structure function and the associated time correlation functions . in section 3",
    "we shall derive expressions for the bulk space - time - dependent structure function of a magnetized degenerate free - electron gas .",
    "some numerical results for this function will be presented as well .",
    "the sections 4 and 5 contain an analysis of the intermediate scattering functions and the dynamical structure factor for the bulk , again with some numerical illustrations . in section 6",
    "we shall verify that in the limit of vanishing magnetic field our results reduce to the well - known expressions for the field - free degenerate free - electron gas .",
    "edge effects are the subject of sections 7 and 8 .",
    "both the cases of a wall perpendicular to and parallel with the magnetic field will be discussed .",
    "the analytical results will be checked numerically .",
    "the equilibrium time - dependent structure function in position space is defined as @xmath0 with @xmath1 the field annihilation operator and @xmath2 the many - body hamiltonian .",
    "the brackets denote an equilibrium average in the grand - canonical ensemble , with the inverse temperature @xmath3 and the chemical potential @xmath4 .",

    "the structure function can be written as the sum of an incoherent and a coherent part @xcite .",
    "these are given as @xmath9 here we introduced the time correlation functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are defined as @xmath12 the first function depends on @xmath4 and @xmath13 , whereas the second does not . in the static case of vanishing @xmath14 the correlation function @xmath11 reduces to @xmath15 .",
    "our main interest in the following will be in the fully degenerate case with @xmath16 . in that case",
    "@xmath10 reduces to @xmath17 with @xmath18 the step function .",
    "the time correlation function for finite @xmath13 can easily be recovered from that of the fully degenerate case , since once has @xmath19 the subscript @xmath16 will often be omitted in the following , so that @xmath20 will be written as @xmath21 .    in uniform systems , or in the bulk of a confined system ,",
    "the structure function @xmath22 depends on the position difference @xmath23 only . in this case",
    "the intermediate scattering function follows by taking the spatial fourier transform of @xmath24 : @xmath25 and similarly for the incoherent and coherent parts .",
    "a further fourier transform leads to the dynamic structure factor : @xmath26 substituting ( [ 2.5 ] ) and ( [ 2.6 ] ) in ( [ 2.3 ] ) and performing the fourier transforms one gets @xmath27 a similar expression can be written down for the coherent part . comparing the two expressions",
    "one easily finds the relation @xmath28 this relation also follows from the principle of detailed balance @xcite , if the symmetry of the coherent dynamic structure factor under a change of sign of both @xmath29 and @xmath30 is taken into account .",

    "passing via the intermediate scattering function @xmath285 , for which we have derived the expressions ( [ 4.8 ] ) and ( [ 4.18 ] ) , we arrive at the dynamical structure factor @xmath286 , as given by ( [ 5.1 ] ) and ( [ 5.3 ] ) .",
    "the curves in figure [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show how both the coherent and the incoherent part of @xmath287 get a spike structure for purely transverse orientations of the wavevector .",
    "the gradual change of these curves as the wavevector gets a longitudinal component can be inferred from the figures . for a purely longitudinal wavevector",
    "a step structure is found , in accordance with ( [ 5.5 ] ) .",
    "the above results pertain to the bulk of magnetized quantum gases .",
    "as is well known , these systems show additional interesting physical phenomena near the walls of the containers to which they are confined .",
    "a second goal of the present paper has been to investigate how the time - dependent correlations change in the vicinity of a confining wall . in general , these edge effects depend on the orientation of the wall with respect to the field .",
    "they have been determined for two specific orientations , namely for a wall perpendicular to the field and for a wall parallel to the field . in the former case",
    "the cylinder symmetry of the field is not changed by the wall . as a consequence",
    ", the time correlation functions are easily obtained from those of the bulk , with results given in ( [ 7.2])([7.3 ] ) .",
    "the curves of figure [ fig4 ] show that the main influence of the wall is a faster time decay of the correlations . for a wall parallel to the field",
    "it is a lot more cumbersome to determine the correlation functions , as the symmetry of the problem is now lost completely .",
    "the general results for the correlation functions are given in ( [ 8.4])([8.5 ] ) .",
    "the curves for the coherent structure function , which are presented in figure [ fig5 ] , show that once again the correlations die out faster than in the bulk . in particular , the characteristic revivals at multiples of the inverse cyclotron frequency , which are a conspicuous feature of the bulk coherent structure function for longitudinal position differences , are almost absent for positions near the wall .",
    "it appears that the wall perturbs the regular patterns of the bulk motion so strongly that the recurrences associated to the cyclotron frequency do no longer influence the correlation functions .",
    "in this appendix we consider several integral relations that are employed in the main text . the first identity , which has been used in section 4 , is @xmath288- \\rme^{-\\rmi kb / c}\\ ; \\theta\\left[4a^2c^2-(k-2bc)^2\\right]\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ \\fl + \\frac{2\\rmi}{k}\\ ; \\rme^{-{{\\scriptstyle \\frac{1}{4}}}\\rmi k^2/c^2}\\ ; \\left\\{\\rme^{-\\rmi ka / c}\\ ; \\theta\\left[4b^2c^2-(k+2ac)^2\\right]- \\rme^{\\rmi ka / c}\\ ; \\theta\\left[4b^2c^2-(k-2ac)^2\\right]\\right\\ } \\label{a.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the function @xmath289 as defined in ( [ 3.10 ] ) and with positive @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath34 and real @xmath290 . to prove it ,",
    "one starts by using a partial integration to rewrite the left - hand side as @xmath291\\ ; f(b , zc)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ + \\left.\\left[\\rme^{-\\rmi(b+zc)^2}-\\rme^{-\\rmi(b - zc)^2}\\right]\\ ; f^{\\ast}(a , zc)\\right\\ } \\label{a.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to determine the integral at the right - hand side , we have to evaluate integrals of the form : @xmath292 for positive @xmath55 , @xmath56 and real @xmath112 .",
    "we differentiate this function with respect to @xmath112 . by adding a suitable multiple of @xmath11 itself we arrive at : @xmath293 integrating by parts and evaluating the ensuing integral",
    "the right - hand side becomes a combination of delta functions : @xmath294 \\label{a.5}\\ ] ] by combining ( [ a.4 ] ) and ( [ a.5 ] ) we arrive at a differential equation , which can easily be solved as : @xmath295 with an as yet unknown function @xmath296 . to determine it we put @xmath297 , and differentiate both sides with respect to @xmath55 . using the definition ( [ a.3 ] )",
    "we find , by differentiating @xmath298 and performing the resulting integral , that @xmath299 is independent of @xmath55 for all positive @xmath55 and @xmath56 . as",
    "a consequence @xmath296 is independent of @xmath55 as well . finally , by considering the limit @xmath300 ( for @xmath297 as before ) in ( [ a.3 ] ) and employing ( [ 3.15 ] ) , we prove @xmath301 , and hence @xmath302 . from these results",
    "we conclude that the term with @xmath303 in ( [ a.6 ] ) can be omitted , so that @xmath304 is determined . after these preparations it is an easy matter to demonstrate the validity of ( [ a.1 ] ) .",
    "a second identity ( used in section 6 ) is @xmath305   \\label{a.7 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for non - negative @xmath56 , @xmath34 ( with @xmath306 ) and positive @xmath55 , @xmath14 . before starting with the proof of this identity",
    ", we remark that its dependence on @xmath55 is trivial , as follows from a rescaling of the variables .",
    "hence , we will put @xmath307 in the following .",
    "the function @xmath289 in the integrand at the left - hand side of ( [ a.7 ] ) may be replaced by the integral representation @xmath308 as may be established from the definition of the fresnel integrals ( or by comparing ( [ 3.6 ] ) and ( [ 3.9 ] ) ) . inserting the integral representation in ( [ a.7 ] ) , we arrive at a double integral over @xmath182 and @xmath112 . introducing new integration variables @xmath309 and @xmath18",
    "by writing @xmath310 and @xmath311 , we rewrite this double integral as @xmath312 the integral over @xmath18 turns out to depend on @xmath56 and @xmath34 only through the combination @xmath313 .",
    "this can be seen by using the standard representation for the bessel function and writing the @xmath18-integral as @xmath314 the argument of the exponential function is proportional to the scalar product of a unit vector in the direction of @xmath315 and a constant vector with cartesian components @xmath316 .",
    "since the integration extends over all directions of the unit vector , the integral ( [ a.10 ] ) , and hence ( [ a.9 ] ) as well , indeed depends on @xmath56 and @xmath34 through the length @xmath313 only .",
    "once this is known , we may evaluate ( [ a.9 ] ) by choosing @xmath317 and replacing @xmath34 by @xmath313 in the answer .",
    "since the bessel function equals 1 for @xmath317 , the integral ( [ a.9 ] ) can easily be evaluated in terms of fresnel integrals , with the result : @xmath318 generalizing this answer to the case @xmath319 in the way indicated , and substituting it in the left - hand side of ( [ a.7 ] ) , we arrive at the desired result .",
