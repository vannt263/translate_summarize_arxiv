    "we study topology of the julia set of the map @xmath2 of the projective plane @xmath1 to itself .",
    "in particular , we show an interesting connection between this map and an uncountable class of plane - filling curves coming from folding a strip of paper .",
    "one of the goals of the paper is to show how techniques of iterated monodromy groups can be used to obtain interesting topological properties of dynamical systems .",
    "all our results are proved using algebraic computations with self - similar groups .",
    "let us start from the end of the article , and describe the plane - filling curves . take a long narrow strip of paper and",
    "fold it in two . then repeat the procedure several times . note that each time you have a choice of two directions of folding . then",
    "unfold it so that you get right angles at the creases .",
    "you will get something like it is shown on figure  [ fig : realpaper ] .",
    "let us record the way we folded the paper as a sequences of letters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , standing for `` left '' and `` right '' , respectively .",
    "fold now two equal strips of paper in the same way ( described by the same sequence of letters @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , and rotate one with respect to the other by @xmath5 .",
    "put them down so that their endpoints touch , see figure  [ fig : realpaper2 ] .",
    "you will get a closed curve @xmath6 , bounding a connected maze of square rooms .",
    "see two examples of such mazes on figure  [ fig : maze ] .",
    "the rooms are shaded black .",
    "two red dots mark the endpoints of the strips of paper , the green dots mark their midpoints ( i.e. , the creases of the first folding ) .",
    "the marked points are vertices of a square ( this easily follows from the construction ) .",
    "let us choose an infinite sequence @xmath7 of letters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "let us draw rescaled closed curves @xmath8 corresponding to finite sequences @xmath9 of instructions in such a way that the marked points stay at the vertices of a fixed square @xmath10 .",
    "let us parametrize the curves @xmath8 uniformly ( proportionally to the arclength ) by @xmath11 $ ] , so that @xmath12}$ ] and @xmath13}$ ] are copies of the folded paper strip .",
    "then the vertices of @xmath10 are @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( the endpoints of the strips ) , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( their midpoints ) .",
    "it follows from the description of the folding procedure that the maze @xmath18 is obtained from the maze @xmath8 by replacing each wall by a corner ( so that the old wall is the hypotenuse and the new walls are legs of an isosceles right triangle ) .",
    "we get then a sequence of curves converging uniformly to some limit curve @xmath19 .",
    "the best known and studied example is the _ heighway dragon curve _ , which corresponds to a constant sequence @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) .",
    "it was defined for the first time by nasa physicists j.  heighway , b.  banks , and w.  harter , and popularized by m.  gardner in scientific american .",
    "it is also called sometimes the `` jurassic park fractal '' , as the curves @xmath22}$ ] appear at the beginning of each chapter of `` jurassic park '' by m.  crichton .",
    "the closed version @xmath23 is called sometimes the _ twin - dragon curve_. see the images of these curves on figure  [ fig : dragon ] . in",
    "@xcite a relation of the twin dragon curve to numeration systems on complex numbers is discussed .",
    "consider the group @xmath24 of transformations of the plane generated by rotations by @xmath5 around the vertices of the square @xmath10 ( recall that it is the square whose vertices are the endpoints and the midpoints of the strips of paper ) .",
    "the fundamental domain of the group @xmath24 is the square @xmath25 of twice bigger area such that vertices of @xmath10 are midpoints of the sides of @xmath25 .",
    "the quotient @xmath26 of the plane by the action of @xmath24 is homeomorphic to the sphere , and can be realized as the pillowcase obtained from the square @xmath25 by folding its corners over the sides or the square @xmath10 .    if we take the curve @xmath8 , then its image @xmath27 on the pillowcase @xmath26 is a nice eulerian path tracing a square grid on the pillow , see figure  [ fig : mazer ] .",
    "the figure shows how pieces of the curve @xmath8 that are outside the fundamental domain @xmath25 are moved inside by elements of @xmath24 ( actually , just by the generators ) .    ]    for every infinite sequence @xmath7 the image @xmath28 of the curve @xmath23 is a curve passing through every point of the sphere @xmath26 .",
    "it follows directly from the construction , that the curves @xmath29 for @xmath30 , [ 1/4 , 1/2 ] , [ 1/2 , 3/4 ] , [ 3/4 , 1]$ ] are similar ( with the similarity coefficient @xmath31 ) to the curves @xmath32}$ ] and @xmath33}$ ] .",
    "the partition of @xmath34 into the defined above sub - curves correspond to splitting the original strip of paper in two ( and `` forgetting '' about the first folding ) .",

    "see figure  [ fig : f ] for a description of @xmath40 . in the limit",
    "@xmath40 induces a piece - wise similarity map from @xmath19 to @xmath41 .",
    "each of the curves @xmath34 divides the sphere into two parts : it separates squares of different color in a checkerboard coloring of the pillow @xmath42 .",
    "the squares of one color are connected to each other by the corridors of the maze in a tree - like fashion .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that in the limit the curve @xmath19 goes around a dendrite that is a limit of the sequence of the trees bounded by @xmath34 .",
    "see , for example  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ii.7 ) , where relation between plane - filling curves and `` rivers '' they bound is explored .",
    "the map @xmath40 induces a degree two branched covering of the dendrite bounded by @xmath41 by the dendrite bounded by @xmath19 .",
    "the case of the twin - dragon curve was analyzed in detail by j.  milnor in  @xcite .",
    "he showed that the dendrites into which the curve @xmath43 separates the sphere can be naturally identified with the julia set of the polynomial @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a root of the polynomial @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , the curve @xmath43 goes around the dendrite in the same way as the _ caratheodory loop",
    "_ goes around the julia set , so that the sphere @xmath26 is the _ mating _ of the polynomial @xmath47 with itself : it is obtained by gluing two julia sets along the caratheodory loops so that one loop is a complex conjugate of the other .",
    "the general paper folding curves @xmath23 were studied in  @xcite where a connection with numeration systems on complex numbers was described ( and closely related to the `` pillowcase folding '' maps @xmath48 ) .    in our paper",
    "we show a relation of the sphere - filling curves @xmath23 with dynamics of the map @xmath2 of the projective plane @xmath1 to itself .",
    "note that on the second coordinate @xmath49 is the rational function @xmath50 , whereas on the first coordinate iterations of @xmath49 are compositions of polynomials @xmath51 , where @xmath52 runs through a forward orbit of iterations of @xmath53 .",
    "intersections of the julia set of @xmath49 with planes @xmath54 are then julia sets of the non - autonomous iterations @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "these julia sets , which we will denote @xmath57 , are dendrites , see figure  [ fig : pjuliasets ] , if @xmath58 belongs to the julia set of @xmath53 .",
    "we show that the dendrites @xmath57 are precisely the dendrites around which the loops @xmath23 go .",
    "moreover , the pillow @xmath42 can be obtained by gluing two copies of @xmath57 along the caratheodory loop going around @xmath57 ( one loop is glued to the other using reflection with respect to a diameter ) .",
    "the curve @xmath23 is the image of the caratheodory loop .",
    "moreover , the construction is dynamical : the map @xmath59 agrees with the double coverings @xmath60 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a short reminder of the main notions and techniques of self - similar groups . section  [ s : julsp ] is devoted to the study of dynamics of the endomorphism @xmath61 .",
    "we start with computation of the iterated monodromy group of @xmath49 in theorem  [ th : imgf ] .",
    "it is a self - similar group acting on a degree 4 rooted tree .",
    "a computationally more convenient group is an index two extension of @xmath62 , which is defined in subsection  [ ss:2extension ] .",
    "we denote it @xmath63 , and it is the iterated monodromy group of the quotient of the dynamical system @xmath61 by complex conjugation .",
    "the group @xmath62 contains a natural subgroup @xmath64 corresponding to non - autonomous iterations @xmath65 of polynomials on the first coordinate .",
    "it is not transitive on the levels of the rooted tree , and we get an uncountable family of quotients of @xmath64 coming from restricting of @xmath64 to invariant binary subtrees .",
    "a similar family of groups was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the graphs of the action of @xmath64 on the levels of binary sub - trees are approximations of the julia sets @xmath66 of the non - autonomous iterations of @xmath65 ( i.e. , the corresponding slices of the julia set of @xmath49 ) .",
    "they are trees , in accordance with the fact that @xmath66 are dendrites .",
    "we study these trees in  [ ss : schreiergraphs ] using recursive description of the generators of the self - similar group @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , we describe inductive algorithms of constructing these graphs , see corollaries  [ cor : rule1 ] and  [ cor : rule2 ] .    in the next subsection we study external angles to",
    "the julia sets @xmath66 , i.e. , the caratheodory loops around them .",
    "the bundle of caratheodory loops is the limit space of the subgroup @xmath67 of @xmath62 generated by the loops not intersecting the julia sets @xmath66 .",
    "we derive from the structure of the group @xmath67 how the bundle of caratheodory loops is glued together from a cantor set of circles , and which external angles land on the points of the line @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , we show that for a countable set of parameters @xmath52 ( equal to the backward orbit of the unique real fixed point of @xmath69 ) there are two external rays to @xmath66 landing on @xmath70 , and that in all the other cases such ray is unique .",
    "in section  [ s : matings ] we define matings of the non - autonomous iterations @xmath65 .",
    "namely , for every @xmath52 in the julia set of @xmath69 consider the corresponding slice @xmath66 of the julia set of @xmath49 , and the caratheodory loop @xmath6 around it .",
    "take then another copy of @xmath66 , and glue them together along the caratheodory loops so that one loop is a mirror image of the other with respect to the diameter containing an external angle landing on @xmath70 .",
    "note that in the case when @xmath52 belongs to the backward orbit of the real fixed point of @xmath53 , there are two such rays , and we have therefore two possible choices for the mating .",
    "we define the mating and study it in purely algebraic terms .",
    "we construct an `` amalgam '' of the group @xmath64 with itself , generating a group @xmath71 by two copies of @xmath64 .",
    "then the inclusion of the two copies of @xmath64 induce semi - conjugacies of the limit dynamical systems .",
    "we show that these semi - conjugacies realize the matings as described in the previous paragraph .",
    "we study then the limit dynamical system of @xmath71 , i.e. , the obtained matings .",
    "we show that the group @xmath71 contains a virtually abelian subgroup @xmath72 such that the inclusion @xmath73 induces a conjugacy of the limit dynamical systems .",
    "then we show that the limit space of @xmath71 is a direct product of the cantor set @xmath74 with the sphere @xmath75 , where @xmath24 is the group of affine transformations of the form @xmath76 for @xmath77 , i.e. , the pillowcase described above .",
    "the limit dynamical system acts as the binary one - sided shift on the cantor set and as multiplication by @xmath78 or @xmath79 on the pillowcase @xmath75 ( the choice of the coefficient @xmath80 depends on the first letter of the corresponding element of the one - sided shift ) .",
    "it follows that the constructed matings are _ latts examples _ , though non - autonomous , as we can choose one of two multiplications .",
    "since @xmath81 the graphs of action of @xmath64 on the levels of the tree are sub - graphs of the graphs of action of @xmath71 .",
    "the graphs of action of @xmath71 are square grids on the pillowcases .",
    "we show that the graphs of action of the two copies of @xmath64 partition the edges of the grid into two disjoint sub - trees , see figure  [ fig : schrdouble ] .",
    "these partitions of a square grid into two subtrees converge to the decomposition of the pillowcase @xmath75 into two dendrites .    in section  [ s : paperfolding ]",
    "we relate the obtained results about the mating with the paper folding curves .",
    "namely , we show that the curve separating the two subtrees of the square grid on @xmath75 coincide with the paper - folding curves @xmath82 described in this introduction , and that in the limit the curves @xmath82 converge to the image of the caratheodory loop in the mating .",
    "the last section  [ s : tuning ] describes structure of the slices of the julia set of @xmath49 that correspond to the values of @xmath52 belonging to the boundaries of the fatou components of @xmath83 .",
    "we show that they are obtained by `` flattening '' the boundaries of the fatou components of the polynomials @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in other terminology",
    "they are obtained by ( rotated ) tuning of these polynomials by the polynomial @xmath86 . as usual , the proof is carried out using just algebraic computations with the iterated monodromy groups .",
    "we present here , in a very condensed form , the main definitions and results of the theory of self - similar and iterated monodromy groups . for a more detailed account ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath87 be a group .",
    "@xmath87-biset _ is a set @xmath88 together with commuting left and right actions of @xmath87 on @xmath88 . in other words , we have two maps @xmath89 and @xmath90 satisfying @xmath91 for all @xmath92 , and : @xmath93 for all @xmath94 , @xmath92 .",

    "the corresponding wreath recursions for these groups are @xmath1067 @xmath1016 @xmath1068 ( here we use a conjugated version   ) , and @xmath1069 @xmath1070 @xmath1064    it follows from the recursions and post - critical dynamics of the polynomials @xmath84 and @xmath85 that the limit space of @xmath1065 with respect to these recursions is the natural direct product of the boundary of the fatou component of @xmath53 containing @xmath311 ( which is the limit space of the subgroup @xmath1071 ) and the boundary of the fatou component of @xmath85 containing @xmath311 ( the limit space of @xmath1072 ) .",
    "similarly , the limit space of @xmath1066 is the direct product of the the boundary of the fatou component of @xmath53 containing @xmath312 ( the limit space of @xmath1073 ) with the boundary of the fatou component of @xmath84 containing @xmath312 ( the limit space of @xmath1074 ) .",
    "hence , both limit spaces are tori .",
    "let us compare the limit spaces of these groups with the limit spaces of their extensions @xmath1076 and @xmath1077 .",
    "we have @xmath1078 , @xmath1079 .",
    "the direct factors @xmath1080 and @xmath1081 are infinite dihedral with the wreath recursions @xmath1082 and @xmath1083 it follows that the limit spaces of the subgroups @xmath1084 and @xmath1085 are segments with singular endpoints ( one with the isotropy group @xmath1086 or @xmath1087 and the other with the isotropy group @xmath709 ) .",
    "consequently , the limit spaces of @xmath1076 and @xmath1077 are annuli ( direct products of a circle and a segment ) and that the natural map from the limit spaces of @xmath1065 and @xmath1066 to the limit spaces of @xmath1076 and @xmath1077 `` flattens '' the tori into annuli , by flattening the circles @xmath1088 and @xmath1089 to the segments @xmath1090 and @xmath1091 . note that the natural direct product decomposition of the spaces @xmath1092 and @xmath1093 comes from the direct product decompositions @xmath1094 and @xmath1095 , while we have decompositions of self - similar groups @xmath1096 and @xmath1079 .",
    "consequently , the preimages of the boundaries of the annuli in the tori are diagonals with respect to the natural decomposition of the torus into the product of the boundaries of the fatou components .",
    "it means that the diameter with respect to which we flatten the boundary of the fatou component of the polynomials @xmath84 and @xmath85 rotates as @xmath52 travels along the boundary of the fatou component of @xmath53 .",
    "this flattening of the circles into segments can be interpreted as a `` rotated tuning '' of the polynomials @xmath84 and @xmath85 by the polynomial @xmath86 ( which is the quadratic polynomial with the dihedral iterated monodromy group and the julia set a segment ) .",
    "it can be nicely illustrated by the slices of the julia set of @xmath49 as @xmath52 travels close to the boundary of the fatou component of @xmath53 , but stays inside in it .",
    "then the slices are still homeomorphic to the julia sets of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , but are close to the dendrite slices of the julia set of @xmath49 along to boundary of the fatou component of @xmath53 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : tuning ] where slices of the julia set of @xmath49 are shown when @xmath52 is traveling close to the boundary of the fatou component of @xmath53 containing 1 ( top half of the figure ) .",
    "corresponding slices for @xmath52 on the boundary of the fatou component are shown in the bottom part of the figure .",
