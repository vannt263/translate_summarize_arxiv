    "long - range magnetic order brought about by purely dipolar interactions is somewhat rare in nature.@xcite interest in the subject is nevertheless growing .",
    "some of it comes from the availability of synthesized crystals of organometallic molecules@xcite that behave at low temperature as single spins.@xcite owing to the large organic mass enveloping the magnetic cores of these molecules , dipole - dipole interactions are then dominant.@xcite long range order has already been observed experimentally.@xcite because uniaxial anisotropy is very large , ising spins with dipolar interactions are reasonable models for these systems.@xcite early rigorous work by luttinger and tisza@xcite established which type of magnetic order obtains at low temperature @xmath4 in dipolar ising models in each of the cubic lattices .",
    "the same results have been arrived at more recently by simpler methods.@xcite    no ising model can however account for some of the interesting collective behavior , such as spin reorientation@xcite ( sr ) and canted ( i.e. , noncollinear ) spin configurations , that can be induced by purely dipolar interactions . accordingly , three component spin models that include exchange as well as dipolar interactions are often used when modeling these effects.@xcite to explore the transition between the dipolar- and exchange - dominated antiferromagnetic phases is one of the aims of this paper .",
    "the sr transition deserves special attention .",
    "thermally driven sr transitions take place well within an ordered magnetic phase .",
    "all spins rotate as a whole as the temperature decreases below some sr transition temperature @xmath5 .",
    "sr transitions can be continuous , as the ones first observed in the bulk @xcite or first order , as often observed in films.@xcite it is important to realize that a sr _ phase _ comes with continuous transitions.@xcite this phase is defined by its own unique set of broken symmetries .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to exhibit this in detail .",
    "it has long been realized that higher order anisotropies , are required for the existence of the sr phase.@xcite accordingly , we choose to study the model hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are for all exchange and dipolar interactions , respectively , @xmath9 , \\label{a}\\ ] ] @xmath1 and @xmath0 are constants , and @xmath10 is the @xmath11 component ( @xmath12 ) of a unit spin @xmath13 at site @xmath14 .    .",

    "( [ a ] ) contributes the desired competition to the uniaxial anisotropy . such a term arises naturally in tetragonal crystal lattices , and",
    "will be seen to bring about the canted spin phase that is shown in the lower left quadrant of fig .",
    "[ pattern2 ] .    to continue with the definition of the model , we let , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a sum over all nearesi neighbor _ bonds _ , and @xmath21 is a classical 3-component unit spin at lattice site @xmath14 . we also consider nearest neighbor exchange interactions in order to establish how small @xmath22 must be for dipolar magnetic order to obtain .    finally , @xmath23 , where the sum is here over all sites @xmath14 and @xmath24 except @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the displacement between sites @xmath14 and @xmath24 .",
    "we let @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 be the values of @xmath31 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 for whatever state is specified .    since we treat all spins as classical unit vectors , no quantum effect is taken into account .",
    "accordingly , we disregard hyperfine interactions , since they have no effect on the thermal equilibrium behavior of electronic spins when the latter are treated classically.@xcite quantum effects , such as the enhancement of the transverse field that is necessary in order to destroy long - range order in lihof@xmath32 below approximately 1 k,@xcite are therefore beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "thus , some numbers we obtain , such as the crossover value of j , below which dipolar interactions become dominant , may change some when hyperfine interactions are included in a quantum treatment . on the other hand , our main results , the insensitivity to the value of @xmath2 to the ratio of the ordering temperature to the sr temperature , as well as the existence of a reverse sr transition , are of a rather qualitative nature , and are therefore expected to be insensitive to quantum effects .",
    "simple cubic ( sc ) lattices and zero applied magnetic field @xmath33 are assumed throughout .",
    "we only work with @xmath34 box like systems , and let dipole - dipole interactions act between each spin and all other spins within an @xmath34 box centered on it .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions , because they give faster convergence towards the @xmath35 limit than free boundary conditions do .",
    "in addition , because we work with antiferromagnets , and not ferromagnets , convergence is faster than would otherwise be .",
    "most of our results follow from simulations for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this would be insufficient for critical behavior work but is adequate for our purposes , that is , establishing which type of magnetic order obtains and the corresponding phase boundaries .",
    "it is worth recalling that thermal equilibrium results obtained for @xmath38 for large cubic - shaped systems can , by virtue of griffith s theorem,@xcite be generalized to other shapes in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "our simulations follow the standard metropolis monte carlo algorithm.@xcite more specifically , we start simulations with an initial configuration in which all spins point in either random or parallel directions .",
    "we next compute the dipolar field at each site .",
    "time evolution takes place as follows .",
    "a spin is chosen at random and temporarily pointed in a new random direction .",
    "let @xmath39 be the corresponding energy change .",
    "if @xmath40 , the temporary direction becomes permanent . if on the other hand @xmath41 the temporary direction becomes permanent only with probability @xmath42 , where @xmath4 is the system s temperature .",
    "the field changes that ensue at every site in the system if the new spin direction is accepted is then computed , thus updating the field values everywhere on the system .    the plan of the paper and a list of the results obtained follow . in sec .",

    "[ sr ] we study the sr phase . in an anisotropy diagram",
    "we show the free energy minima that follow from mc simulations for the sr phase .",
    "the broken symmetries are clearly exhibited .",
    "this suggests how to write mean field equations for the sr transition , from which we obtain @xmath5 as well as the higher ordering temperature as a funtion of @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the ratio of these two temperatures depends mainly on the @xmath3 ratio and rather weakly on @xmath2 , and mean field yields approximately the same value for it as mc simulations do . for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , cooling through the paramagnetic phase first brings the system into @xmath46-canted ordering . the sr phase is encountered at a lower temperature . for @xmath47 but @xmath49 , cooling through the paramagnetic phase first brings the system into @xmath50-collinear ordering , and the sr phase is encountered at a lower temperature .",
    "an interesting phase diagram obtains at @xmath51 , and a reverse spin reorientation that is temperature driven is observed .",
    "a complete spin reorientation , from the easy magnetization axis into the perpendicular plane , first takes place upon cooling below the paramagnetic phase , followed , upon further cooling , by a reverse spin reorientation towards the easy magnetization axis .",

    "we define the canted state @xmath15 .",
    "we do this in order to avoid the difficulty which follows from the the fact that dipolar interactions are not rotationally invariant , thus making the task of simultaneously minimizing @xmath28 and @xmath30 nontrivial .",
    "the canted state @xmath15 enables one to do this minimization .",
