    "the possibility that dark matter ( dm ) be related , directly or indirectly , to the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) deserves the highest consideration .",
    "indeed this has been and is being extensively discussed both in weak - coupling and in strong - coupling scenarios of ewsb .",
    "the strong - coupling case is of interest to this paper , without specific reference to any detailed model .",
    "we consider the case where the forces responsible for ewsb respect a global ( quasi-)conserved charge @xmath9 which enforces the ( quasi-)stability of the lightest particle , @xmath10 , with non vanishing @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is a candidate dm particle .",
    "its mass , @xmath11 , is in the tev range , characteristic of the strong forces that may give rise to ewsb .",
    "this particle is made of constituents that feel the strong force and carry non - vanishing electroweak quantum numbers , but is itself electroweak - neutral .",
    "this is needed in order to suppress the tree - level coupling of @xmath10 to the z - boson , which would be in conflict with direct dm searches .",
    "at face value , the cosmological relic abundance of the @xmath10-particles is too low to explain the observed dm energy density , @xmath12 , normalized as usual to the critical cosmological density .",
    "we have in mind the effect of two body processes , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is any unstable particle lighter than @xmath10 , also feeling the new strong force .",
    "for example , longitudinal w and z bosons may play the role of @xmath14 .",
    "the associated thermally averaged cross section is far bigger than the needed @xmath15pb , since @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) estimate of the strong coupling @xmath18 , and the model - dependent function @xmath19 of the ratio between the @xmath10-mass and the scale @xmath20 characteristic of the new strong interaction is of order unity for @xmath21 .",
    "we are thus led to consider the case where the relic abundance of @xmath22-particles originates from a @xmath23 asymmetry , analogous to the standard @xmath24 asymmetry responsible for the dominance of matter over anti - matter in the present universe .",
    "an interesting aspect of this hypothesis is that one can try to relate @xmath25 to the standard @xmath26 by assuming that @xmath9 , like @xmath27 or @xmath28 , are all broken by mixed electroweak anomalies . in this case ,",
    "non - perturbative electroweak sphaleron interactions at a critical temperature @xmath29 gev may redistribute any original asymmetry , leading in particular today to @xcite @xmath30 which can be about right , @xmath31 , for @xmath11 in the tev range .    in this as in other cases of putative dm particles , the problem is to find experimental signals that would not only establish their existence but would allow a clear interpretation of their nature . to this end",
    "it is difficult to overestimate the interplay between direct dm searches and lhc experiments , as we are going to discuss .",
    "in absence of a detailed model , the possible signal in direct detection searches can be discussed by means of effective operators that mediate the interaction between @xmath10 and the @xmath32-quarks or the photon @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10-particle can be either a complex scalar or a dirac fermion .",
    "if @xmath10 is a scalar , the dominant interactions are described by @xmath33 which for @xmath34 , as expected from nda , give comparable effects .",
    "taking @xmath35 for concreteness , the non - relativistic cross section of @xmath10 on a nucleus of charge @xmath36 and mass @xmath37 is , up to form factor effects , @xmath38 for germanium target this corresponds to the per - nucleon cross section@xmath39 to be compared with the cdms limit on the coherent spin - independent cross section @xcite @xmath40 i.e. @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 tev , where @xmath44 gev is the electroweak vev , the expected cross section ( [ eq : scalar ] ) is about two orders of magnitude below the cdms limit .    if instead @xmath10 is a dirac fermion , assuming parity invariance ( up to anomalies ) of the ewsb forces , the dominant operator is a magnetic moment interaction @xmath45 in germanium , @xmath46 gives rise to the dominant spin - independent cross section due to scattering on the current produced by the nuclear charge : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleous , ranging from the experimental threshold @xmath49 kev to @xmath50 kev ) .",
    "the spin - dependent cross section is subleading due to small nuclear spin of germanium and because of @xmath51 enhancement present in ( [ eq : fermi - si ] ) @xcite",
    ". a suitable comparison of this cross section with the null cdms result gives in this case @xmath52 against the nda estimate @xmath53 .",
    "given the uncertainties of these estimates and of the value of the scale @xmath20 itself , in no way this bound can be interpreted as ruling out a composite fermionic dm particle .",
    "quite on the contrary , the message we draw is that a signal in direct dm searches could be around the corner .",
    "yet we find it preferable , at least for reference , to stick in the following to the scalar case .",
    "suppose that a positive signal were indeed found in direct dm searches at the level indicated above , in fact not far from the present sensitivity .",
    "how would we know that the candidate dm particle is a composite @xmath10-like particle ?",
    "as already mentioned , lhc should come into play here .",
    "however the detection at lhc of an electroweak - neutral particle of tev mass that can only be pair produced may not be an easy task .",
    "for this reason , we turn the question into a different but related one .",
    "what could mediate the operators in eq .",
    "( [ operators ] ) responsible in the first place for the direct dm signal ?",
    "we argue that the most likely candidate for this role is a composite vector iso - singlet @xmath0 , the analog of the @xmath54-meson in qcd , strongly coupled to @xmath10 and mixed with the elementary hypercharge gauge boson @xmath55 , via the diagram of fig .",

    "we assume that the couplings proportional to the epsilon tensor , relevant to the following section , are induced , analogously to the qcd case , by a chiral anomaly .",
    "the strength of the various couplings are all based on nda estimates , known to work well for qcd @xcite , and noticing that the only coupling in ( [ ltot ] ) that corrects at one loop level the @xmath0-mass @xmath63 is @xmath64 in ( [ gs ] ) .    from the diagram of fig .",

    "the iso - singlet nature of @xmath0 makes its exchange innocuous in the electroweak precision tests , giving a contribution to the @xmath68-parameter @xcite well below the @xmath69 level .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) allows to calculate the decay widths of @xmath0 .",
