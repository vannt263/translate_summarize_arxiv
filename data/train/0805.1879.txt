    "experimental evidences of  interference effects produced during grazing scattering of fast atoms from insulator surfaces were recently presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . under axial surface channeling conditions , reported",
    "measurements of scattered projectile distributions display well defined spots , associated with diffraction patterns originated by the periodic structure of the crystal .",
    "even though the diffraction of particles from crystal surfaces has been a well - understood phenomena from the beginning of quantum mechanics , the importance of these experimental results is due to the effect not being expected to be observable for light atoms with energies in the kev range , whose de broglie wavelengths are some orders of magnitude smaller than the shortest interatomic distance in the crystal .",
    "two different interference mechanisms have been proposed to explain the experimental observations .",
    "the first of them @xcite is related to the diffraction by a periodic lattice and relies on the assumption that the projectile motion perpendicular to the axial incidence channel can be decoupled from the parallel one .",
    "the semiclassical approach @xcite proposed for the description of this mechanism predicts a maximum in the distribution when the component normal to the scattering plane of the final projectile momentum coincides with a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "such a result , also confirmed by means of a wave packet propagation approach @xcite , is in accord with the experimental data for the lowest impact energies  @xcite . the second mechanism winter08 , called supernumerary rainbow , is originated by the corrugation of the surface potential , which gives rise to a quantum interference between projectiles emerging from the surface with the same direction but reflected at different turning points  @xcite .    to describe the experimentally observed patterns , in this article we introduce a distorted - wave model , named surface eikonal approximation , which is valid for small de broglie wavelengths of incident atoms .",
    "this method makes use of the eikonal wave function @xcite to represent the elastic collision with the surface , while the projectile movement is classically described , taking into account different initial conditions .",
    "the surface eikonal approach can be considered as an extension of the well - known glauber approximation @xcite for collisions with corrugated surfaces @xcite instead of atoms , but considering axial channeled trajectories .",
    "it includes both interference mechanisms and the idea behind it essentially coincides with that of the semiclassical formalism avrin94 used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the surface eikonal approach is here employed to describe angular distributions of  swift  he@xmath0 atoms scattered off from a lif(001 ) surface , for which there are experimental data available winter07,roncin07,winter08 . as the considered process is very sensitive to the description of the surface potential ,",
    "the aim of the work is to investigate the influence of the polarization on the interference patterns . in our model",
    "the interaction of the incident atom with the crystal surface is represented as a sum of individual interatomic potentials , which take into account the contribution of  the different ionic centres of the insulator material @xcite . to evaluate the interatomic potentials we use the abrahamson approximation @xcite , adding the asymptotic contribution of the projectile polarization .",
    "the role of the polarization is analyzed for incidence along the 100 and 110 channels , finding that polarization effects are important for this latter crystallographic direction .",
    "atomic units ( @xmath1 ) are used unless otherwise stated .",
    "let us consider the grazing impact of an atomic projectile ( @xmath2 ) , with mass @xmath3 , on a crystal surface ( @xmath4 ) . as a result of the collision , the projectile with initial momentum @xmath5 is elastically scattered from the surface , ending in a final state with momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the frame of reference is fixed on a target ion belonging to the first atomic layer , with the surface contained in the @xmath7 plane and the @xmath8 versor perpendicular to the surface , aiming towards the vacuum region .",

    ", when the projectile is far from the surface , @xmath9 tends to the state @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the initial ( final ) unperturbed wave function .    the central magnitude to describe the elastic scattering process is the transition matrix , which reads @xmath16 in the energy range of interest , eq .",

    "the position @xmath19 of the incident atom at a given time @xmath20 is governed by the newton equations associated with the potential @xmath12 , verifying the relation @xmath21 @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the classical velocity of the projectile , @xmath24 identifies its initial position on the surface plane and @xmath25 . a sketch picture of the projectile path and the coordinate system is displayed in fig .",

    "from the figure we can differentiate two different regions of the interatomic potentials . as @xmath88 , @xmath89 and",
    "the sharp increase at the origin corresponds to the electrostatic contribution @xmath90 , while the maximum at intermediate distances  is mainly due to the statistical contribution , i.e. @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92  note that present static potentials are almost indistinguishable from the ones of gordon and kim @xcite ( empty circles ) , employed in ref .",
    "the asymptotic limit of @xmath93 as @xmath94 is affected by the polarization , i.e. @xmath95 @xmath96    the projectile trajectory was derived  from classical dynamics with the runge - kutta method . at every step we took into account the 4@xmath97 order nearest neighbor target ions ( i.e. @xmath98 ) , which includes the interaction of the projectile with the topmost atomic layer and three more layers below it .",
    "we have made sure our results do no depend on the considered number of nearest neighbors by increasing this number to include up to 8@xmath97 order nearest neighbors ( i.e. , 8 atomic planes ) .",
    "the evaluation of the eikonal transition matrix involves an integration on the starting point @xmath99 of the classical trajectory , which was calculated with the montecarlo technique , varying @xmath99 on the area of the unit cell as a consequence of the surface invariance . in every case we considered around @xmath100 classical trajectories with random initial positions , and",
    "this number was varied in order to test the convergency of our calculations . the further integration on @xmath20 involved in eq . ( [ teikn ] )",

    ", we have to add the t - matrix elements corresponding to different values of @xmath99 that lead to the _ same _ final momentum @xmath6 . for this purpose",
    "we employed a grid for the angles @xmath102 and @xmath103 of @xmath104 points , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the final polar and azimuthal angles , respectively , of the final momentum @xmath6 .  in all calculations we oriented the @xmath105 versor along the low - index direction of the crystal surface coinciding with the impact direction",
    "; therefore , the azimuthal angle @xmath103  is measured with respect to the incidence direction on the surface plane ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in full accord with the experiments of refs . @xcite",
    "we found that under axial surface channeling conditions the relation @xmath106 is almost strictly verified by all classically scattered projectiles and consequently , the angular projectile distribution shows the usual banana shape @xcite .",
    "we start the analysis by considering the experimental case of fig . 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ; that is , 3 kev @xmath107he atoms impinging on a lif(001 ) surface along the crystallographic direction 110 with a glancing angle ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "this collision system looks adequate for the eikonal description because the de broglie wavelength of the incident atom ( @xmath109 a.u . )",
    "is almost three orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic interatomic distance . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the differential probability @xmath110 , as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath103 , multiplying the results by an arbitrary factor in order to show the different curves separately . the eikonal spectrum displays strong interference signatures , presenting pronounced maxima symmetrically placed with respect to the incidence direction , which corresponds to @xmath111 .",
    "this interference pattern can be directly compared with the experimental spots of ref .",
    "@xcite , which are displayed with stars , numbering them from the central one .",
    "the eikonal distribution nearly agrees with the experimental one , although  the eikonal maxima associated to the peaks @xmath1121 , @xmath1122 , @xmath1123 , and @xmath1124 are slightly shifted to higher values .",
    "notice that the extreme angles of the eikonal spectrum are related to the rainbow scattering and the corresponding maxima display a sharp shape .",
    "these peaks are also present in the classical distribution , defined as the number of projectile trajectories reaching a given final azimuthal angle @xmath103 , which is shown in an _ absolute _ scale in fig .",
    "the classical scattering distribution presents the typical rainbow profile @xcite , with only two maxima around the extremes of the angular spectrum -the rainbow angles .",
    "then , the absence of intermediate structures  in the classical spectrum confirms the concept that interference effects are a consequence of quantum coherence between projectiles moving along different paths but ending in the same final state .    with the aim of analyzing the influence of the polarization of  helium atoms , in fig .",
    "3 we also plot eikonal values obtained by neglecting the polarization potential ; that is , by dropping @xmath59 in the projectile - surface interaction .",
    "we found that for incidence along the direction 110 , the angular distribution of scattered atoms is affected by the projectile polarization . when the polarization is not included in the calculation , the central maximum becomes a minimum , modifying the total number of peaks displayed by the eikonal distribution . in turn , the extreme maxima , associated with the rainbow angles , are only slightly altered by the polarization .",
    "both angular regions - central and external- of the eikonal spectrum are associated with different zones of the interatomic potentials  that are probed by axial channeled projectiles .",
    "he@xmath0 atoms that reach azimuthal angles @xmath113 near 0 move  over the ionic rows that form the channel , farther than 2 a.u . from the surface , interacting with the long - distance contribution of the surface - projectile potential . as a such contribution",
    "is dominated by the term corresponding to the polarization potential , given by eq.([vpol ] ) , it explains the influence of this effect on the central zone of the spectrum .",
    "projectiles that end in the rainbow angular region , instead , suffer closer collisions with f ionic centers , being affected by the short - distance behavior of the interatomic potentials , which is determined by coulombic and statistical contributions .    in fig .",
    "4 we investigate the elastic scattering along the direction 100 by considering a higher impact energy ( 8.6 kev ) . the eikonal differential probability is plotted in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) as a function of the final azimuthal angle , together with experimental spots of fig . 2 of ref . @xcite .",
    "for this collision system , in addition to the two rainbow maxima , the eikonal distribution presents four similar peaks , symmetrically placed around @xmath111 ,  and a very small central maximum .",
    "the number of main maxima of the eikonal profile coincides with that of the experimental pattern @xcite , although the positions of the peaks are again shifted to higher values in comparison with the experimental ones .",
    "in all the cases we found that slight changes in the interatomic potentials produce substantial modifications in the angular spectrum of scattered projectiles .",
    "hence , discrepancies between theoretical and experimental spectra could be associated with very subtle differences in the projectile - surface potential . in fig .",
    "4 ( b ) we compare experimental intensities @xcite with eikonal probabilities , now plotted in linear scale , as function of the deflection angle @xmath114 , defined as @xmath115 . taking into account that our theoretical results were obtained by considering fixed positions of the target ions , _ without _ including the thermal vibration , and they were _",
    "not _ convoluted with experimental conditions , the eikonal model reproduces fairly well the main features of the experimental spectrum .    in order to investigate the effect of the polarization in the channel 100 , in fig 4 ( a ) we show eikonal values derived by eliminating the polarization potential",
    "remarkably , eikonal results with and without including the projectile polarization agree with each other for incidence along the 100 direction , indicating that polarization effects play a minor role in this channel .",
    "it is a consequence of the ordering of the halide and alkali ions involved in the axial surface channeling . as observed from eq .",
    "( [ vpol ] ) , when the projectile moves along the channel far from the surface plane , the factors of the polarization potential coming from  f@xmath72 and li@xmath70 have opposite signs and they compensate their contributions to order @xmath116 when f@xmath72 and li@xmath70 ions are placed in front of each other , as it happens in the 100 direction . furthermore , within a row model , the 100 rows  - formed by alternate cations an anions - display a neutral charge , which reduces the polarization of the incident atom . in the 110 direction , instead ,  not only are there separated cation and anion rows , with positive and negative net charges respectively , but also li@xmath70 and f@xmath117ions are not in front of each other along the channel , which originates an effective polarization potential .",
    "this is the reason why polarization effects become evident for incidence along the 110 direction but not in the channel 100 .    besides , in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) we also show the angular distribution obtained within the first born approximation [ eq.([tborn ] ) ] , which is derived from eq .",
    "( [ teikn ] ) by eliminating the eikonal phase .",
    "the born profile displays a different diffraction pattern , with a broad central maximum , not present in the experiment , indicating that interference structures of the surface eikonal model are affected by the phase @xmath118 , given in eq .",
    "( [ fasen ] ) .",
    "however , note that differences between eikonal and born distributions vary with the considered collision system .    finally , in fig .",
    "5 we considered the incidence conditions of ref .",
    "roncin07 , which correspond to a smaller impact energy ( 0.2 kev ) .",
    "notice that this energy is close to the limit of validity of the eikonal model , which is expected to be adequate for high velocities .",
    "for scattering along the direction 110 , the eikonal differential probability is displayed in fig .",
    "5 , as a function of the azimuthal angle , comparing it with the spots of fig .  1 of  ref . @xcite . also in this case , the agreement of the eikonal theory with the experiment is reasonable good . both profiles - eikonal and experimental - present similar structures , with a central maximum and two additional peaks , not equally spaced , to each side .",
    "however , the experimental peaks @xmath119 are narrower than the eikonal ones , and small structures around the rainbow angles are absent in the theory , corresponding to the worst disagreement found in the present work .",
    "discrepancies between the theory and the experiment can be again attributed to extremely subtle distinctions in the projectile - surface potential .",
    "moreover , we should mention that the small rumpling ( @xmath120 a.u . ) of  the surface ions introduced in our model @xcite affects the interference pattern .    again , like in fig .",
    "3 , the central zone of the eikonal spectrum of fig . 5",
    "is associated with the long - distance behavior of the surface interaction , which is governed by the projectile polarization .",
    "when @xmath59 is dropped , the central maximum of the eikonal distribution completely disappears , in disagreement with the experimental data .    to investigate in detail the central zone of the eikonal spectrum , in fig 6",
    "we plot the first ten projectile trajectories , provided by the montecarlo code , that contribute to the distribution at the final azimuthal angle @xmath121 .",
    "for the collision system of  fig .",
    "3 we observe that all the atoms that end in this angular region move just over f@xmath72 or li@xmath86 rows . in this case , turning points corresponding to the z- movement are almost independent  of the motion perpendicular to the scattering plane , being approximately situated 2.8 a.u .",
    "( 2.2 a.u . ) above the topmost atomic layer for projectiles moving over f@xmath72 ( li@xmath70 ) rows . from fig",
    ". 6 ( c ) , the transversal kinetic energy , defined as @xmath122 , slightly increases just before and after reaching the collision region , indicating that incident atoms are affected by an attractive polarization potential .",
    "the projectile - surface potential along classical trajectories , shown in fig . 6 ( d ) , displays an oscillatory pattern produced by the interaction with the different ionic centers of the crystal surface .",
    "consequently , the total transversal energy @xmath123 presents fluctuations along the classical projectile path .",
    "however , the mean value @xmath124  keeps equal to the initial value @xmath125 along the whole trajectory , supporting to some extend the decoupling of the transversal movement from the parallel one , proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a surface eikonal approach to deal with interference patterns produced by impact of swift atoms on insulator surfaces .",
    "the proposed method has been applied to few kev he atoms grazing impinging on lif(001 ) along the 110 and 100 directions .",
    "projectile spectra derived with the eikonal approximation display well - defined interference structures , originated by atoms that follow different paths but end scattered with the same final momentum . as the projectile distribution  strongly depends on the description employed to represent the projectile - surface interaction , the study focused on the influence of the projectile polarization on the angular spectrum .",
    "we conclude that the polarization potential is essential to describe the elastic scattering along the 110 channel , while in the direction 100 its contribution is negligible .",
    "angular spectra derived from the eikonal model , including the polarization effect , are in concordance with the available experimental  data @xcite . but a better representation of the surface potential , taking into account that target ions are part of a surface , might modify the present results . then , by including more precise electronic densities this method may be useful to investigate very delicate items , such as long - distance potentials or crystal ion displacements , which are difficult to make evident experimentally farias04 ."
