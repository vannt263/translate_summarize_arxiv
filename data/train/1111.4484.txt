    "<S> in contrast , a plot of @xmath6 as a function of the shaking velocity @xmath68 ( fig .  [ risetime ] ) shows an excellent collapse of the data . throughout the parameter regime where the collapse holds </S>",
    "<S> , we find that boundary driven convection is the dominant mechanism responsible for the rise of the intruder . </S>",
    "<S> this collapse holds for the entire range of intruder densities and the two intruder sizes ( diameters @xmath20  cm and @xmath43  cm ) that were used . </S>",

    "<S> we note that @xmath69 has been used as a scaling parameter in the vibro - fluidized regime  @xcite that is typically realized at much higher driving ( @xmath76 ) and is _ not _ wall - driven . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been noted in experiments on granular compaction by tapping that @xmath69 , rather than @xmath5 , is the appropriate control parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , no scaling has been achieved so far in the boundary - driven convection regime . </S>",
    "<S> given the non - homogeneous flow fields that are set up in our experiments , the dependence of @xmath6 on shaking velocity is rather surprising .    </S>",
    "<S> the absence of any dependence of the rise - time of the intruder on its size and density implies that convection is the dominant driving mechanism . to confirm this premise </S>",
    "<S> , we make an independent measurement of the convection velocity of the mustard seeds without the intruder </S>",
    "<S> . for measuring the convection velocity at the wall , tagged particles ( yellow mustard seeds of sizes and densities lying within the same range as the black mustard seeds ) were distributed randomly in the bed of black mustard seeds . over a range of shaking frequencies and amplitudes </S>",
    "<S> , we measured the velocity of these tagged particles moving down the two side walls ( supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> high speed tracking of mustard - seed convection at the side walls was done using an idt motionpro high speed camera at a rate of @xmath77 frames / sec . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of the boundary layer particles is an order of magnitude larger than the mean velocity of the intruder . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ velm ] , the convection velocities measured by this procedure show a much better data - collapse when plotted against @xmath78 than when plotted as a function of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a linear extrapolation of the data to zero convection velocity gives a critical velocity of @xmath63  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 cm / sec for the onset of convection . </S>",
    "<S> this critical velocity range overlaps with the range of the fitting parameter @xmath79 obtained from the rise - time data . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural to identify @xmath79 as the critical shaking velocity required for the onset of convection cycles in the granular column .    ) </S>",
    "<S> corresponds to a set of ( amplitude , frequency ) parameter values for which bne was observed in our experiments , while the points ( @xmath80 ) represent data sets where no bulk convection , and therefore no bne , was observed . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line corresponds to @xmath81 , while the dashed line corresponds to @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> bulk convection occurs only in the region where both the conditions @xmath83 and @xmath84 are satisfied.,width=316 ]    our understanding of the different parameter regimes for boundary driven convection is summarized in the phase - diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that while @xmath85 is necessary for bulk convection , it is not a sufficient condition . as seen in the phase diagram </S>",
    "<S> , there is a region of parameter values , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where no bulk convection occurs . in experiments performed in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , we observed some motion of the mustard seeds restricted entirely to the the upper corners of the bed . </S>",
    "<S> such a condition can not give rise to bne for the intruder sizes studied here . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that for much larger intruder sizes , other mechanisms may come into play which can drive bne @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified ( supplementary material ) that the scaling of rise - time continues to hold for different bed - widths , wall roughness and for choice of bed - particles . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that on varying the bed - height , the scaling holds for smaller heights ( supplementary material ) but breaks down for larger heights . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic origins of the parameters @xmath88 , @xmath71 and @xmath79 are not clear as they depend on the cell geometry which is easily characterizable , as well as on details such as the wall , and bed - particle roughness , which are harder to characterize .    </S>",
    "<S> the scaling dependence of the velocity and the rise - time on the shaking velocity @xmath89 can roughly be understood by analyzing the hydrodynamical equations that have been earlier used to describe vibrated granular systems . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the system is nearly incompressible in the bulk and hence the appropriate equations for the velocity field @xmath90 and the granular temperature @xmath91 , in the steady state , are @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the `` granular fluid '' density , the pressure @xmath94 and the viscosity and thermal conductivity are given by @xmath95  , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 being the mean free path and particle diameter respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dissipation is given by the term @xmath98 . with a rescaling of the variables @xmath99 and @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is some typical coarsening length scale , the above equations transform to @xmath102 for large @xmath5 , the last term in eq .   can be neglected , and the scaled equations become independent of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this may explain the scaling behaviour of velocities with @xmath89 seen in our experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we anticipate that a similar scaling should hold even in three - dimensional granular systems in some parameter regime where granular convection is the dominant mechanism driving the bne . </S>",
    "<S> we note that since the experiments in @xcite were performed at a fixed frequency , their result @xmath103 is consistent with our scaling form @xmath7 with @xmath104 .    </S>",
