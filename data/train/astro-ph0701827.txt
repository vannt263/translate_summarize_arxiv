    "none of the chemical models considered here reproduce the abundances of all the observed species satisfactorily .",
    "these models like all the other chemical and radiative transfer models for hmcs assume the energizing source to be at the center , with centrally peaked temperature and density profiles .",
    "in addition , there are reasonable arguments in favor , as well as , against the complex molecule formation mechanisms ( grain - mantle evaporation , grain - surface chemistry , gas - phase chemistry ) .",
    "thus , from the physical point of view all these models are not directly applicable to g34.26 + 0.15 , which as our observations show is externally heated and additionally might be harboring multiple unresolved hmcs .",
    "there are two main uncertainties in our estimates of the column densities of the different species : _",
    "( i ) _ we have assumed a single kinetic temperature , rather than a temperature profile , the value of which may also be off by 50  k for some of the species and _ ( ii ) _ the  estimate is also not accurate .",

    "the errorbars drawn at the 50% level in fig .",
    "[ modelcomp ] attempt to quantify these uncertainties in addition to the statistical errors and the errors in absolute calibration .",
    "since the difference in abundances between the ne and se peaks of g34.26 + 0.15 never exceeds a factor of 3 and the discrepancy between the observed and predicted abundances are of the order of factors of 10 or more , our conclusions would not have been significantly different had we compared the observed abundances at the se peak with the model predictions .",
    "further , we have shown that the abundances observed in g34.26 + 0.15 are not atypical compared to other galactic hot cores .",
    "thus , discrepancies by factors of 10 to 100 between the abundances observed in g34.26 + 0.15 and the predictions of the chemical models can not be explained by the estimated errors in abundance calculations .",
    "given the inappropriateness of the existing chemical models and uncertainties in the derived relative abundances we consider any age / timescale related discussion for the hmc in g34.26 + 0.15 beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "despite the present consensus on the contemporaneous existence of  and  bearing grain mantles , chemical differentiation in hot core regions is also well - established from observations .",
    "such chemical differentiation was prominently noticed in the two clumps in the orion - kl cloud core , very close to the luminous and massive young stellar object , irc2 : the hot core and the compact ridge . while the warmer and",
    "denser hot core shows unusually high abundances of h - rich complex n - bearing molecules like ch@xmath1chcn and , the compact ridge is characterized by high abundances of large oxygen - bearing molecules like ,  and . however , later observations of the orion - kl hot cores by @xcite suggest that the chemical differentiation is probably not as drastic as it was first thought to be . similar chemical differentiation is observed between the two hot cores w3(h@xmath1o ) and w3(oh ) in the w3 region @xcite .",
    "these sources are spatially offset by about 0.06 pc and yet they exhibit clear signs of n / o differentiation .",
    "both sources show emission from , h@xmath1co , , and , but only the maser source shows significant emission from , , and so2 @xcite , as well as from hcn @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "several chemical models have partially explained the chemistry of both the hot core & the compact ridge @xcite in orion . @xcite",
    "have shown that the evaporation of rich grain mantles inhibit high abundances of o - bearing large molecules , though the already injected alcohols remain abundant for much longer .",
    "this leads to the formation of n - rich hot cores .",
    "@xcite further showed that in collapsing cores both n - rich and o - rich species tend to co - exist .",
    "however , it might be possible to derive the age of the cores based on the relative abundance of the two types of species because  is found to be more abundant at earlier times whereas hcn and  form later on @xcite .",
    "observational detection of large number of daughter species in hot cores suggest that the chemical timescale needs to be shorter than the dynamical timescale , _",
    "i.e. , _ the cores need to be gravitationally supported up to 10@xmath65  yrs @xcite .    within the inner regions of g34.26 + 0.15",
    "we find that the n - bearing species tend to peak to the south - east , while the peaks of the o - bearing species are concentrated to the north - east of the continuum peak .",
    "the ne and the se peaks are primarily separated along the north - south direction by 08 , which at a distance of 3.7  kpc translates to 0.014  pc . for comparison , the hot core and the compact ridge regions in the orion - kl cloud at a distance of 450  pc are separated by 0.018  pc .",
    "thus , given the larger distance to the source and the angular resolution of the present observations , the possibility of the two emission peaks actually belonging to two different cores , one being n - rich and the other being o - rich , can not be ruled out .",
    "although the two peak positions in g34.26 do not show large difference in  abundances , differences in the abundances of , ,  and  show contrasts quite similar to what is seen in orion - kl @xcite .",
    "additional high angular resolution observations of molecular lines are required to derive a better estimate of the temperature distribution , in order to improve the derived abundances at the two peak positions seen within the inner regions of the hmc in g34.26 + 0.15 .",
    "we have presented high angular resolution mapping observations of the hmc in g34.26 + 0.15 tracing different chemical species characteristic of hot cores .",
    "the higher angular resolution enables us to probe the inner regions of the hot molecular gas .",
    "the observations presented here is only a first step and needs to be augmented by observations of standard temperature and density sensitive molecular transitions to constrain the physical attributes of the region which can then be used as constraints for future chemical models .",
    "we do not detect any evidence for an energizing source at the center of the hot core , the continuum peak at 2.8  mm is consistent with the free - free radio continuum emission from component c of the uc h iiregion .",
    "the intensity distribution of the various molecular tracers do not peak at the same position , the peaks of none of the distributions is located either at the position of the continuum peak or the positions of the h@xmath1o and oh masers .",
    "the temperature and density distributions of the inner regions of the hot cores can not be determined from the present observations .",
    "based on intensity and velocity distribution , only component c , the most evolved of the h iiregions associated with g34.26 + 0.15 appears to influence the energetics of the hot molecular gas .",
    "the kinematics of the hot core as derived from the velocity distribution of the molecular tracers is not strongly influenced by the h ii  region dynamics .    within the inner regions of the hot core in g34.26",
    "+ 0.15 we find that the nitrogen and oxygen - bearing species tend to show a dichotomy and peak at different positions , separated by 08 , the spatial separation being similar to the two hot / warm cores identified in the orion .",
    "we propose that as in orion and in w3(oh ) , ( i ) these peak positions may indeed be separate regions of chemical enrichment , resolution of which would require even higher angular resolution observation and ( ii ) may arise due to the external influence of the neighboring h ii  regions .",
    "we have estimated the abundances of the observed molecular species at the two peak positions assuming a single kinetic temperature of 160  k under conditions of lte .",
    "the high angular resolution observations presented here , provides overwhelming evidence in favour of the hot molecular gas at spatial scales of 0.018  pc being externally heated .",
    "this together with the clumpiness of the region and possible existence of multiple hmcs in the region , implies geometries more complicated than those considered by the state - of - art chemical models . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we follow @xcite to derive a crude upper limit for the luminosity of the internal energizing source if any , using the kinetic temperature derived in this paper and stefan - boltzmann law .",
    "the luminosity of the hypothetical and so far undetected internal source is estimated to be 8.9@xmath2610@xmath65  @xmath71  and this corresponds to a o7.5 zams star @xcite .",
    "comparison of the abundances observed in g34.26 + 0.15 with currently available somewhat inappropriate chemical models for hot cores by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest that the nitrogen richness of the region can only be explained by the evaporation of ammonia - rich ice - mantles .",
    "however , this implies that the abundances of the oxygenated daughter species be suppressed in the presence of ammonia , which is not the case in g34.26 + 0.15 .",
    "this can mean any of the following ( i ) the oxygenated species in question are also formed on grain mantles , ( ii ) the two regions are actually separate from each other or ( iii ) there may be additional gas - phase processes which can progress efficiently even in the presence of ammonia to create high abundances of oxygenated daughter species , which the chemical models do not yet consider",
    ". comparison of abundances observed in a few hot cores ( in addition to g34.26 + 0.15 ) and the chemical models show that the chemical models do not yet consistently explain the abundances of all species in any of the hot cores",
    ". the complicated geometry of g34.26 + 0.15 makes direct comparison of the observed abundances with the chemical models even more difficult .",
    "one of the major caveats of the estimates of the abundances presented here in the hot molecular gas is the assumption of a single kinetic temperature characterizing the emission of the different species .",
