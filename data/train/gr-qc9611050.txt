    "<S> we propose a kaluza - klein approach to general relativity of 4-dimensional spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is based on the ( 2,2)-splitting of a generic 4-dimensional spacetime , which is viewed as a local product of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional base manifold and a 2-dimensional fibre space . in this kaluza - klein formalism </S>",
    "<S> we find that general relativity of 4-dimensional spacetimes can be interpreted in a natural way as a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory . in a gauge </S>",
    "<S> where the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional metric can be written as the polyakov metric , the action is describable as a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional yang - mills type gauge theory action coupled to a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional non - linear sigma field and a scalar field , subject to the constraint equations associated with the diffeomorphism invariance of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional base manifold . </S>",
    "<S> diffeomorphisms along the fibre directions show up as the yang - mills type gauge symmetries , giving rise to the gauss - law constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the einstein s equations in the polyakov gauge and discuss them from the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory point of view . </S>",
    "<S> finally we show that this kaluza - klein formalism is closely related to the null hypersurface formalism of general relativity .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction [ s1 ]    the exact correspondence of the euclidean self - dual einstein s equations to the equations of motion of 2-dimensional non - linear sigma models with the target space as the area - preserving diffeomorphism of 2-surface@xcite has inspired us to look further into the intriguing question whether the full - fledged general relativity of 4-dimensional spacetimes can be also formulated as a certain ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theory . </S>",
    "<S> recently we have shown that such a description is indeed possible , by rewriting the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity of 4-dimensional spacetimes as a 4-dimensional kaluza - klein ( kk ) action@xcite in the framework of the ( 2,2)-decomposition of spacetimes . in this kk approach </S>",
    "<S> , the 4-dimensional spacetime is viewed , at least for a finite range of spacetime , as a locally fibred manifold that consists of a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional base manifold and a 2-dimensional  auxiliary \" fibre space . remarkably , it turns out that the kk approach , which is often thought a means of dimensional reduction to 4-dimensional spacetimes from higher dimensions via isometries , can be made a useful tool for studying general relativity of a generic spacetime of 4-dimensions from the perspective of lower dimensional spacetimes such as the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime , for instance .    </S>",
    "<S> there are certain advantages of this 4-dimensional kk approach to general relativity in the ( 2,2)-splitting , which led us to develop this formalism . here </S>",
    "<S> we list a few of them . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions , there exist a number of field theoretic methods recently developed thanks to the string - related theories . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully the rich mathematical methods suitable for ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theories might also prove useful in studying certain aspects of general relativity of 4-dimensional spacetimes , provided that a sensible ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theory description of such spacetimes is available . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in this kk approach based on the ( 2,2)-splitting of spacetime , it will be seen that general relativity can be understood in a natural way as a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional yang - mills type gauge theory coupled to a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional non - linear sigma field and a scalar field , with built - in symmetries and interactions prescribed by the diffeomorphism invariance of the associated 4-dimensional spacetimes .    </S>",
    "<S> second , this yang - mills type gauge theory description of general relativity simplifies considerably certain issues concerned with the constraints . in yang - mills type theories , it is well - known that the gauss - law constraints associated with the yang - mills gauge invariance can be made trivial , if we consider physical , gauge invariant quantities only . thus , in principle , one might expect that the problem of solving constraints of general relativity could be made _ trivial _ , at least for some of them , if such a gauge theory description is possible . in the ( 2,2)-kk approach , </S>",
    "<S> the relevant constraints that can be treated this way are those associated with the group of diffeomorphisms of the 2-dimensional fibre space , _ not _ the entire 4-dimensional spacetime . of course </S>",
    "<S> the remaining two constraints must be studied separately@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> third , in the null hypersurface formalism , it is well - known that the exact gravitational wave degrees of freedom reside in the conformal 2-geometry of the wave front 2-surface , transverse to the propagation direction of the gravitational wave . </S>",
    "<S> this identification of the exact gravitational degrees of freedom has been particularly useful in the analysis of gravitational waves in the asymptotically flat spacetimes@xcite , and in the asymptotic quantization@xcite and in the canonical analysis of the null hypersurface formalism@xcite , in the hope of getting quantum theory of gravity by quantizing the true physical degrees of freedom of gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out , as we shall see later , that the ( 2,2)-kk formalism is in essence a _ novel _ reinterpretation of the null hypersurface formalism of 4-dimensional vacuum general relativity from a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional point of view , using the kaluza - klein ideas . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we expect that this ( 2,2)-kk formalism will be most appropriate for studying problems involving gravitational waves such as scatterings of gravitational waves , and quantizing gravitational waves , or perhaps for quantum gravity .    </S>",
    "<S> fourth , it is well - known that the null hypersurface formalism , particularly the newman - penrose formalism , is outstanding as a method of finding exact solutions of the einstein s equations . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this feature will also survive in the ( 2,2)-kk formalism , in view of the manifest correspondence of both formalisms , as is shown in section [ s5 ] and [ s6 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> last , but not the least , this ( 2,2)-kk formalism brings about _ unusual _ conceptual issues related to the interpretation of general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> namely , this ( 1 + 1)-dimensional description of 4-dimensional spacetimes allows us to _ forget _ about the 4-dimensional spacetime picture of general relativity : instead , it enables us to study the subject much the way as we study yang - mills type gauge theories coupled to matter fields in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions , where the yang - mills gauge symmetry is an infinite dimensional group of diffeomorphisms of the 2-dimensional fibre space . apart from the technical questions such as how to deal with such an infinite dimensional group of diffeomorphisms , this ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theory description certainly puts 4-dimensional spacetime physics into a completely _ new _ perspective , from which a number of interesting speculations on general relativity of 4-dimensional spacetimes could be put forward .    in view of these advantages of the kk formalism in the ( 2,2)-splitting and the related null hypersurface formalism </S>",
    "<S> , it therefore seems worth exploring the ( 2,2)-kk formalism carefully in order to see what could be learned more about general relativity of 4-dimensional spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ] </S>",
    "<S> , we shall outline the general ( 2,2)-decomposition of 4-dimensional spacetimes , and introduce the kk variables _ without _ assuming any spacetime killing vector fields . </S>",
    "<S> it will be seen that the lie derivative , rather than the metric - compatible covariant derivative , appears naturally in this formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we defer the details of computations to appendix [ a2 ] .    in section [ s3 ] </S>",
    "<S> , we shall introduce a coordinate condition , known as the polyakov gauge in the literatures on ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theories . in the polyakov gauge </S>",
    "<S> , the scalar curvature of 4-dimensional spacetime is found to assume a surprisingly simple form that permits a natural ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theoretic interpretation .    in section [ s4 ] , we shall present the einstein s equations in the polyakov gauge in terms of the kk variables . </S>",
    "<S> the natural time coordinate in this formalism is found to be the _ affine _ parameter of the null geodesics . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that one of the einstein s equations in this formalism can be written in a form of the schrdinger equation , reminiscent of the brill wave equation .    in section [ s5 ] , </S>",
    "<S> a review of the null hypersurface formalism is given , and the relation between the kk variables and the null tetrads is explicitly shown . </S>",
    "<S> then , in section [ s6 ] , we shall establish the correspondence between the kk field equations and the einstein s equations , using the well - known classification of the einstein s equations in the null hypersurface formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize this paper in section [ s7 ] .    in appendix </S>",
    "<S> [ a1 ] , we shall find the transformation properties of the kk variables _ without _ assuming any spacetime killing vector fields , and identify the kk scalar , tensor and gauge fields in the absence of such killing vector fields . in appendix </S>",
    "<S> [ a2 ] , we shall present the prescription of computing the scalar curvature of 4-dimensional spacetimes , using the kk variables . </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate steps of computations are also presented , in the hope that computations can be relatively easily checked . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also present the surface terms in the action integral for future references , although we shall not use them in this paper . in appendix [ a3 ] , it is shown that @xmath0 , which appears in the discussion of the einstein s equations in section [ s4 ] , is positive definite .    </S>",

    "<S> the most general form of @xmath178 compatible with this condition can be written as @xmath180 as can be easily confirmed by inspection . </S>",
    "<S> the complex null tetrads @xmath174 and @xmath173 , which satisfy the defining relation ( [ tet ] ) , with @xmath176 and @xmath178 given by ( [ el ] ) and ( [ en ] ) , respectively , become @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath68 are complex quantities such that @xmath183 , since @xmath184 has a zero norm . ] . </S>",
    "<S> putting together ( [ el ] ) , ( [ en ] ) , ( [ em ] ) and ( [ embar ] ) into ( [ conditiona ] ) , we find that @xmath185 if we compare these metric coefficients with the ones given in ( [ fixed ] ) in section [ s3 ] , we find that the kk variables can be written in terms of the null tetrads as @xmath186 equivalently , the null tetrads can be written as @xmath187    classification of the field equations [ s6 ]    it will be instructive to find how the kk field equations ( [ cpm ] ) , @xmath188 , @xmath149 in section [ s4 ] are related to the einstein s equations in the standard null hypersurface formalism . </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that , in the standard null hypersurface formalism , the einstein s equations are classified into six main equations , one trivial equation , and three supplementary equations . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath189 be the einstein tensor . </S>",
    "<S> then the einstein s equations are classified as @xmath190 moreover , the bianchi identity @xmath191 can be used to prove the following lemma@xcite : suppose that the main equations hold everywhere ; then ( i ) the trivial equation holds everywhere , and ( ii ) the supplementary equations hold everywhere if they hold at some @xmath75 hypersurface .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to see what these classified equations are like in the newman - unti coordinate , we have to find the covariant null tetrads @xmath192 in the newman - unti coordinate first , and then form the above combinations using them . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath158 is already given by the equation ( [ els ] ) in section [ s5 ] . to find @xmath193 , </S>",
    "<S> we notice that @xmath194 since @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 . thus , </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath198 in ( [ resa ] ) in section [ s3 ] , we find that the coefficients of the complex null tetrad @xmath174 are given by @xmath199 where @xmath200 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the equation @xmath201 gives @xmath202 where we used the equation ( [ en ] ) and ( [ nicc ] ) in section [ s5 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now write the main equations , the trivial equation , and the supplementary equations in the newman - unti coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath203 can be written as @xmath204 therefore we have @xmath205 also @xmath206 becomes @xmath207 where we used the equation ( [ split ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the main equations ( [ clast ] ) are equivalent to the following set of equations @xmath208 notice that @xmath209 becomes , @xmath210 using the main equations </S>",
    "<S> . therefore we have the following correspondence @xmath211 assuming that the main equations hold . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the supplementary equations now . using the main equations ( [ maineq ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath212 becomes @xmath213 where in the last line we used the equations @xmath214 which follow from the equations ( [ maineq ] ) and ( [ triz ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , provided that the main equations and the trivial equation hold , we find that @xmath215 this equation , together with its complex conjugate @xmath216 yields @xmath217 this shows that the following sets of equations are equivalent , @xmath218 provided the main equations and the trivial equation hold . </S>",
    "<S> finally let us notice that @xmath219 becomes @xmath220 where we again used the main equations and the trivial equation . from ( [ ccc ] ) and ( [ final ] ) , we find that the followings are equivalent : @xmath221 putting these results together , the einstein s equations in the standard null hypersurface formalism become , in the newman - unti coordinate , as follows : @xmath222    having expressed the main equations , trivial equation , and supplementary equations in the newman - unti coordinate , we now wish to group the kk field equations ( [ cpm ] ) , @xmath188 , ( [ eqc ] ) in accordance with the above classification . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath223 be the einstein - hilbert action . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of @xmath223 with respect to the metric . ] @xmath224 is given by @xmath225 where the integration is over 4-dimensional spacetime . in terms of the kk variables ( [ gen ] ) in section [ s2 ] , </S>",
    "<S> the metric variations can be written as @xmath226 therefore @xmath227 becomes @xmath228 if we equate the coefficients of each variation in ( [ relb ] ) to zero , we could obtain the einstein s equations written in terms of the general kk variables without any gauge - fixing . if we use the gauge condition ( [ res ] ) in section [ s3 ] at the end of the above variations , then we find that in @xmath229 stands for the einstein tensor @xmath189 evaluated in the polyakov gauge ( [ res ] ) in section [ s3 ] . ] @xmath230 the equations resulting from these variations will be precisely the kk field equations , i.e. the equations ( [ cpm ] ) , @xmath188 , ( [ eqc ] ) in section [ s4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the equations of motion of @xmath13 , @xmath231 can be split into three equations by taking trace with @xmath13 , and by multiplying with @xmath232 and its complex conjugate . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant equations are @xmath233 which correspond to the equations ( [ eqb ] ) and ( [ prop ] ) in section [ s4 ] obtained by the variations with respect to @xmath99 and @xmath234 . thus , together with the equations ( [ factoa ] ) and ( [ separ ] ) , the complete set of the kk field equations in terms of the einstein tensor becomes , in the polyakov gauge , @xmath235 notice that the right hand side of the classification ( [ xxx ] ) requires the main equations be valid throughout . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if we assume that @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath155 , the equations ( [ factoa ] ) , @xmath188 , ( [ gi ] ) become , @xmath239    it is well - known that the four equations @xmath240 , when @xmath164 is viewed as the time coordinate , are the four constraint equations of the vacuum general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> these are the equations ( [ cia ] ) , ( [ efa ] ) , and ( [ gia ] ) , which correspond in the kk formalism to the constraint equations ( [ eqa ] ) , ( [ eqd ] ) , and ( [ eqc ] ) in section [ s4 ] , since only the first @xmath55-time derivatives appear in these equations .    discussions [ s7 ]    in this paper , we presented the kk formalism of general relativity of 4-dimensional spacetimes , viewing the spacetime as a fibred manifold , namely , a local product of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional base manifold and the 2-dimensional fibre space . within this framework </S>",
    "<S> , we made a decomposition of a given 4-dimensional spacetime metric into sets of fields which transform as a tensor field , gauge fields , and scalar fields , with respect to the group of diffeomorphisms of the 2-dimensional fibre space . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , using the polyakov gauge , we arrived at an amazingly simple expression of the einstein - hilbert action , i.e. a yang - mills type gauge theory action coupled to a non - linear sigma field and a scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> then we presented the einstein s equations in terms of these fields .    </S>",
    "<S> this kk approach has several advantages , as we already mentioned . in connection with issues of quantum gravity </S>",
    "<S> , this approach has the following aspects which deserve further remarks . </S>",
    "<S> first , the problem of solving the einstein s constraint equations is known to be one of the most important tasks in quantum general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in the ( 2,2)-kk approach , the diffeomorphisms of the 2-dimensional fibre space turns out to be a local gauge symmetry , exactly as in yang - mills theory . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the two constraint equations associated with these diffeomorphisms can be automatically solved , by using the diff@xmath2-invariant quantities . however , there are two additional constraint equations which require further studies@xcite in order to fully take care of the four einstein s constraint equations .    </S>",
    "<S> second , the polyakov gauge is shown to be equivalent to the newman - unti coordinate , modulo the diff@xmath2 transformations . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that , in the null hypersurface formalism in the newman - unti coordinate , the physical gravitational degrees of freedom can be easily isolated , whereas in the standard ( 3 + 1)-formalism or in the adm formalism such an isolation can be done only in the linearized theory . </S>",
    "<S> hence the kk formalism in the polyakov gauge shares this salient feature of the null hypersurface formalism : it is the non - linear sigma field @xmath94 with a unit determinant that is precisely the physical gravitational degrees of freedom , which are also known as the conformal 2-metric of the transverse 2-surface in the null hypersurface formalism .    </S>",
    "<S> third , it is also of interest to find how the lightcones fluctuate in quantum gravity . in the formalism </S>",
    "<S> it is quite easy to address this issue . </S>",
    "<S> recall that a lightcone is a collection of null vector fields originating from a given spacetime point . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant null vector field is , as given in section [ s5 ] ( with @xmath183 ) , @xmath241 which clearly has a zero norm . </S>",
    "<S> this vector field is controlled by the fields @xmath58 and @xmath147 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by quantizing these fields , we can quantize the lightcone itself without referring to any background spacetime geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> fourth , it should be mentioned that the lie derivative appears naturally in this formalism , via the _ minimal _ couplings to the diff@xmath2-valued gauge fields . in the standard </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 + 1)-formalism , the natural derivative operator is the metric - compatible covariant derivative , which requires the metric be non - degenerate . the lie derivative , on the other hand , can be defined even when the metric is degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the kk formalism , based on the notion of the lie derivative , should be extendable to spacetimes where the metric is degenerate , which would be hard to describe in conventional approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> one may also attack more `` practical '' problems in classical general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we expect the kk formalism to be useful for problems such as finding exact solutions of the einstein s equations@xcite , in view of the fact that the null hypersurface formalism , particularly the newman - penrose version , has been proven extremely useful for such problems . to those problems concerned with asymptotically flat radiative spacetimes@xcite or gravitational waves in general </S>",
    "<S> , the new formalism may be also applicable . </S>",
    "<S> a related but probably more challenging problem is to reinterpret _ all _ the known exact solutions of the einstein s equations from the perspective of the yang - mills type gauge theories coupled to the non - linear sigma field and a scalar field on the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional base manifold . </S>",
    "<S> this seems very interesting , for there are a number of exact solutions of the einstein s equations which do not permit a sensible physical interpretation from the 4-dimensional spacetime perspective@xcite .    finally , we would like to remark on the question of finiteness of quantum gravity . since the question whether a theory is renormalizable or not depends critically on what spacetime dimensions the theory is defined on , this ( 1 + 1)-dimensional description of general relativity of 4-dimensions may lead to a happy conclusion that quantum gravity is , after all , a _ finite _ theory , at least when viewed from this ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theory perspective .    </S>",
