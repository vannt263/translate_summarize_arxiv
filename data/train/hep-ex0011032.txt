    "bes is a large general purpose solenoidal detector at the beijing electron positron collider ( bepc ) .",
    "the details of besi are described in ref .",
    "the upgrades of besi to besii include the replacement of the central drift chamber with a vertex chamber composed of 12 tracking layers , the installation of a new barrel time - of - flight counter ( btof ) with a time resolution of 180ps and the installation of a new main drift chamber ( mdc ) , which has 10 tracking layers and provides a @xmath7 resolution of @xmath8 for particle identification and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 in gev ) momentum resolution for charged tracks .",
    "the barrel shower counter ( bsc ) , which covers @xmath11 of @xmath12 solid angle , has an energy resolution of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 in gev ) and a spatial resolution of 7.9 mrad in @xmath15 and 2.3 cm in z , is located outside the tof .",
    "outermost is a @xmath16 identification system , which consists of three double layers of proportional tubes interspersed in the iron flux return of the magnet .",
    "based on a @xmath1 @xmath2 event sample , collected at besi , many studies on @xmath2 decays have been performed and some are published . at the end of 1999 , we started a new @xmath2 run with the upgraded besii .",
    "up to now we have accumulated @xmath5 @xmath2 events , which is already the largest @xmath2 sample in the world . by the end of 2001 , we hope to reach our goal of collecting @xmath17 @xmath2 events . fig .",
    "1 shows us the @xmath2 event samples in the world .",
    "one of the distinctive features of qcd as a non - abelian gauge theory is the self - interaction of gluons .",
    "the indirect evidence for gluon - gluon interactions has been obtained at high energies .",
    "however , glueballs , the bound states of gluons , predicted by qcd , have not been confirmed yet .",
    "therefore , the observation of glueballs is , to some extent , a direct test of qcd .",
    "the @xmath4 , first observed by the crystal ball collaboration in @xmath18 @xcite , has been considered as the lightest @xmath3 glueball candidate because of its large production rate in gluon rich processes , such as @xmath2 radiative decays , @xmath19 central production _",
    "etc _ , and because of the lattice qcd calculation of the lightest @xmath3 glueball mass @xcite . however , the spin - parity of @xmath4 is not determined after many years efforts . based on besi",
    "@xmath1 @xmath2 data , a partial wave analysis is performed to the @xmath4 mass region in @xmath0 channel . in each of the subplots in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath20 invariant mass is depicted as points with error bars , and the resulting components from fits to the data are shown as the solid histograms .      at present , the newly accumulated @xmath5 @xmath2 data has been calibrated and reconstructed .",
    "the inclusive @xmath15 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 signals and their fitted masses are shown in fig .",
    "3 .    fig .",
    "4 is the invariant mass spectra and dalitz plot for @xmath24 .",
    "clear @xmath25 and @xmath26 signals are seen in the 2@xmath27 and @xmath28 invariant mass spectra , respectively . in the @xmath29 mass distribution , which recoils against the @xmath26 , an @xmath30 and a big bump around 500 mev",
    "are observed .",
    "the invariant masses of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are plotted in fig . 5 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 decay .",
    "both @xmath23 and @xmath22 are nicely peaked .",
    "based on the @xmath5 @xmath2 events , some very preliminary results are obtained .",
    "partial wave analyses ( pwa ) of @xmath35 and @xmath37 are performed .",
    "6 represents the contribution of every component from the fit to @xmath35 .",
    "three @xmath3 resonances , located at 980 mev , 1370 mev and 1770 mev , and one @xmath38 resonance at 1270 mev are observed in the @xmath29 invariant mass recoiling against the @xmath15 . in @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "components are found to be needed for a good fit .",
    "the projection of different components in @xmath20 mass is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath2 radiative decay @xmath42 is a rich source of glueballs .",
    "in addition to studying the radiative decays exclusively , the inclusive @xmath27 spectrum is another place to search for glueballs . due to the relatively poor energy resolution for bsc",
    ", we use @xmath27 conversion to @xmath43 pairs inside our detector and then measure the momenta of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the mdc , which has a momentum resolution of @xmath46 ( @xmath10 in gev ) , to avoid using bsc energy information and thus improve the energy resolution . fig .",
    "8 plots the energy resolution of @xmath47 via converted @xmath27 energy . the inclusive @xmath27 spectrum is plotted in fig",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "9 that there is a bump at @xmath48 gev , which corresponds to the position of @xmath49 .",
    "the energy resolution is about 12 mev at that point .",
    "according to perturbative qcd , the dominant process for hadronic decays of both @xmath2 and @xmath6 is the annihilation of @xmath50 and @xmath51 quark into three gluons . in this case",
    ", the partial width for the decay is proportional to the wave function at the origin in the non - relativistic quark model for @xmath52",
    ". therefore one can expect  @xcite that , for any hadronic final state @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "+ this is the so called `` @xmath55 '' rule . + in order to test `` @xmath55 '' rule , systematic studies on @xmath6 hadronic decays have been carried out based on @xmath56 @xmath6 events , which was collected by besi and is the largest @xmath6 data sample in the world .",
    "table 1 summarizes some of the branching ratios of @xmath6 hadronic decays , that we have measured so far , as well as the ratios @xmath57 of branching fractions of @xmath6 to @xmath2 . of those branching fractions of @xmath6 listed in table 1 ,",

    "the cross sections for @xmath60 hadrons , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are shown in fig .",
    "the solid curves are the fit curves to the data .",
    "the final results and systematic errors are still under study .",
    "the qed running coupling constant @xmath63 and the anomalous magnetic moment of muon @xmath64 are two fundamental quantities for the precision test of the standard model @xcite .",
    "the precisely measurement of r , which is defined as : @xmath65 is essential for interpreting @xmath66 experiment carried out at bnl and precisely evaluating @xmath67 .",
    "two scans were performed with besii to measure r in the energy region of 2 - 5 gev in 1998 and 1999 .",
    "the first run scanned 6 energy points covering the energy from 2.6 to 5 gev in the continuum and the results have been published @xcite .",

    "the average uncertainty on r is @xmath68 , which is a factor of 2 - 3 improvement compared to the previous measurements .",
