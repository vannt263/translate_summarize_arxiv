    "we performed low resolution spectroscopy with a 1  slit in the @xmath1-band ( 2.2@xmath7 m ) which yields analysis of several diagnostic lines such as hydrogen recombination lines ( pa@xmath3 & br@xmath4 ) and rotational - vibrational molecular hydrogen lines .",
    "the stellar co absorption bands at wavelengths @xmath82.295@xmath7 m allow analysis of dominating stellar spectral classes , though the absorption band is strongly affected by the rising non - stellar continuum towards the center of an agn ( see chapter [ spectroscopy ] ) .",

    "an underrepresentation of ellipticals is consistent with the results of other samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
