    "in view of the possibility for improved measurements of the total cross section in the energy region from approximately 3  gev up to 12  gev at cleo  @xcite it seems useful to analyze the relevance of measurements at the different energy points for a variety of precision studies of the standard model .",
    "the issues discussed in this brief note are :    * the determination of the strong coupling @xmath1 , * the contributions from this region to the running of the fine structure constant , * the determination of the charm and bottom quark masses .",
    "we will not be concerned with the interpretation of the ( narrow and wide ) resonances in the context of quarkonium spectroscopy .    for definiteness we shall distinguish the following energy regions accessible by cleo and the corresponding contributions to the parameters of interest :    * the continuum below charm threshold @xmath3 , excluding the narrow @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances , * the charm threshold region @xmath6 with its rapidly varying cross section and wide charmonium resonances , * the continuum region below the bottom threshold @xmath7 , again excluding the narrow bottonium resonances @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , * the bottom threshold region @xmath11 with its rapidly varying cross section and wide resonances , * the continuum region starting at 11.5  gev , * the electronic widths of the narrow resonances @xmath4 and @xmath5 , * the electronic widths of the narrow @xmath12 resonances .",
    "the separation points 5  gev and 11.5  gev should only be considered as approximate and are chosen such that pqcd is valid at and above these energies , an assumption to be tested by experiment .",
    "predictions for @xmath13 based on pqcd are valid down to fairly low energies . at present",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment has been tested at the level of @xmath14 in the energy region between 3 and 10.5  gev .",
    "this has led to a determination of @xmath1 which already demonstrates the running of @xmath1 as extracted from the same observables , albeit at vastly different energies .",
    "the results as derived from present experiments ( including those derived from @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig::asrun ] .",
    "measurements with precisions of 1% , would be nearly competitive with the determination of @xmath1 from @xmath15 decays  @xcite ( @xmath17 ) and the hadronic @xmath16-decay rate  @xcite ( @xmath18 ) and would lead to a beautiful confirmation of its running from @xmath19 down to @xmath20 as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig::asrun ] .",
    "detailed predictions based on pqcd are available for the continuum regions ( r1 ) , ( r3 ) and ( r5 ) ( see  @xcite and references cited therein ) . given",
    "@xmath1 , the remaining uncertainty from unknown higher orders has been estimated to be around 2.5% , 1.5% and 2.5% for 3  gev , 5  gev and 11.5  gev , respectively .",
    "the validity of pqcd at these points is taken for granted in all sum rule calculations ( see below section  [ sec::moments ] ) and in the recent analyses of @xmath2  @xcite whereas the earlier papers employed pqcd only above 40  gev ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    ".[tab::delal]contributions to @xmath21 ( in units of @xmath22 ) from the energy regions ( r1 ) , ( r3 ) and ( r5 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the importance of the improved determination of the cross section for charm and bottom production in their respective threshold region has been discussed .",
    "both regions are of importance for measurements of @xmath1 in the intermediate range .",
    "the charm region is of particular relevance for the hadronic contribution to the electromagnetic coupling at @xmath19 .",
    "an improved determination of @xmath23 and @xmath24 with a precision below 15  mev and 30  mev , respectively , seems within reach , once these cross sections are known to better than 2% . in general a precise determination of @xmath25 at a few selected points , e.g. 3  gev , 3.73  gev , 5  gev , 10.5  gev and 11.5  gev combined with a scan through the threshold regions for charm and bottom production ( and an evaluation of the weighted integrals ) would be sufficient for this purpose .",
    "the additional measurement of @xmath25 at two or three selected points between 5 and 10  gev could provide additional confidence in pqcd motivated interpolations .",
    "we thank d. cassel for initiating this work and for discussions .",
