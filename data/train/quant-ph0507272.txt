    "the schrdinger equation ( @xmath28 ) for the real ( hermitian ) potentials are investigated to generate the real energy eigenvalues which are of much interest [ 1 ] .",
    "for the first time and latter others have investigated several complex potentials on the @xmath3symmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "the main reason for the growing recent interest in @xmath29symmetry.[1 ] is that the eigenvalues ( spectrum ) of every hamiltonian is real ( @xmath3symmetry is exact ) or come in complex conjugate pairs of complex eigenvalues ( @xmath3symmetry is spontaneously broken ) [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ] .",
    "afterwards , non - hermitian hamiltonians with real or complex spectra have been studied by using numerical and analytical techniques [ 10,11,12,13,14 ] .",
    "various different techniques have been employed in solving the above mentioned potential cases .",
    "one of these methods which makes it possible to present the theory of special functions by starting from a differential equation has been developed by nikiforov and uvarov ( nu ) method [ 15 ] .",
    "this method is based on solving the time - independent @xmath28 by reducing it into a generalized equation of hypergeometric form .",
    "exact solution of se for central potentials has generated much interest in recent years .",
    "so far , these potentials are the parabolic type potential [ 16 ] , the eckart potential [ 17,18 ] , the fermi - step potential [ 17,18 ] , the rosen - morse potential [ 19 ] , the ginocchio barrier [ 20 ] , the scarf barriers [ 21 ] , the morse potential [ 22 ] and a potential which interpolates between morse and eckart barriers [ 23 ] .",
    "many authors have studied on exponential type potentials [ 12,24,25,26,27 ] and quasi exactly solvable quadratic potentials [ 28,29,30 ] .",
    "in addition , dirac , klein - gordon , and duffin - kemmer - petiau equations for a coulomb type potential are solved by using this method [ 31,32 ] .",
    "the exact solutions for these models have been obtained analytically .",
    "so far , we have solved the nonrelativistic and semi - relativistic wave equations using the statistical model [ 33 ] , a different approach to the shifted large 1/n expansion technique [ 34 ] and also the shifted large @xmath30 expansion technique [ 35 ] with a wide group of static phenomenological and qcd - motivated potentials to produce the heavy and light quarkonium spectra .",
    "in addition , the energy eigenvalues of the bound states of an electron in the general exponential cosine screened coulomb potential are obtained using the shifted large 1/n expansion method [ 36 ] . in this work ,",
    "we solve the @xmath28 using @xmath31 method with some well - known @xmath32 potentials [ 4,13,14,37 ] .",
    "this potential form has been used widely in analysis of heavy - ion reaction and has enjoyed success [ 37 ] .",
    "it is selected for a shell model which can be used for describing metallic clusters in a successful way and for lighting the central part of the interaction neutron with one heavy nucleus [ 38,39 ] .    in the present work ,",
    "the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hermitian and non - hermitian form of the generalized @xmath33 potential are calculated by employing the @xmath31 method .",
    "the contents of this paper is as follows : in section ii we breifly present the generalized form of woods - saxon potential inspired from the susyqm . in section iii",
    ", we present nikiforov - uvarov method and also the solution of the schrdinger equation with hermitian form of the generalized @xmath33 potential for the @xmath34 and @xmath35 cases . in section iv ,",
    "the @xmath36symmetric and non-@xmath3symmetric non - hermitian potential forms are also investigated .",
    "shapes of the potential and energy are studied in section v. finally , in section vi we give results and conclusions .",
    "the motion of the free electrons which have conclusive influence on the abundance of metallic clusters  is a vital problem in the nuclear physics .",
    "these electrons are moving in well defined orbitals , around the central nucleus and in a mean field potential which is produced by the positively charged ions and the rest of electrons . in the mean field potential ,",
    "the details of the potential are described by free parameters such as depth , width and slope of the potential , which have to be fitted to experimental observations .",
    "the interactions between nuclei are commonly described by using a potential that consist of the coulomb and the nuclear potentials .",
    "these potentials are usually taken to be of the ordinary @xmath33 form [ 40 ] and has been widely used in analysis of heavy - ion reactions [ 37 ] .",
    "recently , arai [ 41 ] has introduced the deformed hyperbolic potentials using the definitions of the deformed hyper functions . as an example",
    ", we may choose the inter - nuclear generalized @xmath33 of spherically symmetric form as [ 42 ]    @xmath37    where @xmath38 stands for the center - of - mass distance between the projectile nucleus and the target nucleus .",
    "the other parameters in the potential @xmath39 is the radius of the corresponding spherical nucleus or the width of the potential , @xmath40 is the target mass number , @xmath41 is the radius parameter , @xmath42 is the potential depth of the coulombic part ( i.e. , the first term on the right hand side of eq.(1 ) ) , @xmath43 is the surface diffuseness parameter which is usually adjusted to the experimental values of ionization energies [ 37 ] and finally @xmath44 is an introduced parameter for the second part of eq.(1 ) ( transforms like potential barrier ) [ 42 ] .",
    "further , @xmath45 is the deformation parameter for the strength of the exponential part other than unity which is arbitrarily taken to be a real constant within the potential .",
    "its worthwhile to note that the spatial coordinates in the potential are not deformed and thus the potential still remains spherical .",
    "therefore , we start with the original @xmath28 :    @xmath46    where the classical phase space is assumed to be real , i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath47 are the standard hermitian operators representing the position and momentum of a particle of mass @xmath48 employing the separation of variables    @xmath49    leads to the simple radial @xmath50 for all angular momentum states , of the type    @xmath51    now , the aim is to solve the last equation for the given potential in eq.(1 ) for the @xmath34 and @xmath35 cases using the nikiforov - uvarov method which will be introduced breifly and employed in section iii .",
    "the nikiforov - uvarov ( @xmath31 ) method provides us an exact solution of eq.(4 ) for certain kind of potentials among them the one given in eq.(1 ) [ 15 ] .",
    "this method is based upon the solutions of general second order linear differential equation with special orthogonal functions [ 43 ] . for a given real or complex potentials , the @xmath3symmetric @xmath28 in one dimension",
    "is reduced to a generalized equation of hypergeometric type with an appropriate @xmath52 coordinate transformation .",
    "thus , it takes the form :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are polynomials , at most of second - degree , and @xmath56 is of a first - degree polynomial . to find a particular solution for eq .",
    "( 5 ) by separation of variables , we use the transformation given by    @xmath57    this reduces @xmath28 , eq.(5 ) , into an equation of hypergeometric type :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is found to isatisfy the condition @xmath60 further , @xmath61 is the hypergeometric type function whose polynomial solutions are given by rodrigues relation    @xmath62 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath63 is a normalizing constant and the weight function @xmath64 must satisfy the condition [ 15 ]    @xmath65    the function @xmath66 and the parameter @xmath67 required for this method are defined as @xmath68 and    @xmath69    here , @xmath66 is a polynomial with the parameter @xmath70 and the determination of @xmath71 is the essential point in the calculation of @xmath72 thus , for the determination of @xmath73 the discriminant under the square root is being set equal to zero and the resulting second - order polynomial has to be solved for its roots @xmath74 .",
    "hence , a new eigenvalue equation for the @xmath28 becomes    @xmath75    where    @xmath76    and it will have a negative derivative .",
    "therefore , we start solving @xmath77 for the @xmath0 generalized @xmath33 following the @xmath31 for @xmath78 and @xmath35 cases as follows :      in order to calculate the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions , the hermitian real - valued potential form given by eq.(1 ) is substituted into the one@xmath79dimensional @xmath3symmetrical @xmath80 with the zero angular momentum states ,    @xmath81 r(x)=0,\\ ] ]    where some assignments of one - dimensional parameter @xmath82 and @xmath83 are done .    now , rewriting eq.(14 ) by employing the convenient transformation , @xmath84 then the @xmath3symmetrical hermitian one - dimensional @xmath28 becomes    @xmath85 r(s)=0,\\ ] ]    and also introducing the given dimensionless parameters :    @xmath86    finally it leads into the following simple hypergeometric form given by    @xmath87 ^{2}}\\times \\left [ \\left ( -\\epsilon q^{2}+\\beta q-\\gamma \\right ) s^{2}+\\left ( 2\\epsilon q-\\beta \\right ) s-\\epsilon \\right ] r(s)=0.\\ ] ]    hence , comparing the last equation with the generalized hypergeometric type , eq.(5 ) , we obtain the associated polynomials as    @xmath88    when these polynomials are substituted into eq.(10 ) , with @xmath89 we obtain    @xmath90    further , the discriminant of the upper expression under the square root has to be set equal to zero .",
    "therefore , it becomes    @xmath91 ^{2}-4\\times 4\\epsilon \\left ( q^{2}+4\\epsilon q^{2}-4\\beta q+4\\gamma -4kq\\right ) = 0.\\ ] ]    solving eq.(20 ) for the constant @xmath73 we get the double roots as @xmath92 thus , substituting these values for each @xmath71 into eq.(19 ) , we obtain    @xmath93 ; \\text { \\ \\ \\ for \\ \\ }",

    "of course it is clear that by imposing appropriate changes in the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath109 the index @xmath110 describes the quantization for the bound energy states . in addition , if the parameter @xmath44 in eq.(28 ) is adjusted to zero ( for @xmath111state ) , solution reduces to the form obtained for the standard @xmath33 potential without regarding of the centrifugal barrier potential and the deformation parameter @xmath45 in eq.(4)@xmath112states , in atomic units , is e@xmath113 ^{2},$ ]  which is in agreement with previous works on susyqm ( cf .",

    "let us now find the corresponding wavefunctions . applying the @xmath31 method ,",
    "the polynomial solutions of the hypergeometric function @xmath61 depends on the determination of weight function @xmath64 which is found to be    @xmath114    substituting into the rodrigues relation given in eq.(8 ) , the eigenfunctions are obtained in the following form    @xmath115 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath116 stands for the normalization constant and its value is @xmath117 in the limit @xmath118 the polynomial solutions of @xmath119 are expressed in terms of jacobi polynomials , which is one of the classical orthogonal polynomials , with weight function @xmath120 in the closed interval @xmath121 , $ ] yielding @xmath122 [ 43 ] .",
    "finally , the other part of the wave function in eq.(6 ) ( with @xmath123 ) is found to be    @xmath124    combining the jacobi polynomials and @xmath59 in eq.(31 ) , the @xmath111wave functions ( @xmath125 could be determined as    @xmath126    with @xmath127 and @xmath128 is a new normalization constant .",

    "thus , comparing eq.(34 ) with its counterpart eq.(1 ) , one can arrive into the transformation of @xmath131 @xmath132 moreover , eq.(34 ) can also be rewriten as    @xmath133    where @xmath134 and @xmath135 the lowest energy levels of the potential in eq.(34 ) are now given    @xmath136 ^{2},\\text { \\ \\ } 0\\leq n<\\infty , \\text { \\ \\ } q\\geq 1.\\ ] ]    for scattering processes , it has been well accepted that the surface diffuseness parameter @xmath43 is around @xmath137 @xmath138 [ 37,44,45 ] .",

    "this @xmath208 term has its physical basis arising from the superpotential partner of the @xmath33 potential in susyqm [ 42 ] .",
