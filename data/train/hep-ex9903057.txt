    "the rare decay  is a flavor changing neutral current , mediated in the standard model ( sm ) by heavy quark loops@xcite , and is sensitive to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath1@xcite .",
    "this sensitivity arises from the heavy top quark mass , the hard gim suppression , and the negligible long distance contribution@xcite .",
    "the hadronic matrix element can be determined from the  rate , with the inclusion of isospin violating and electroweak radiative effects@xcite .",
    "the small qcd corrections have been calculated to next to leading log@xcite .",
    "the qcd corrections to the charm quark contribution are the major source of the intrinsic theoretical uncertainty .",
    "this leads to a 7% uncertainty in the calculation of the branching ratio@xcite .",
    "if @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 were perfectly known , @xmath1 could be determined to @xmath66% .",
    "given the current uncertainties in @xmath3 , @xmath7 , , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 mixing , the standard model prediction for the branching ratio , is 0.61.5@xmath11 .",
    "a measurement of b ( ) is one of the theoretically cleanest ways of determining @xmath12 .",
    "combined with the other ` golden mode ' , , the ckm triangle can be completely determined from the @xmath13 system . with new measurements of the ckm parameters in the @xmath14 system expected from the @xmath14-factories , additional tests of the standard model , comparing results from @xmath13 s and @xmath14 s ,",
    "will be possible .",
    "in many extensions to the standard model the effects on the @xmath13 and @xmath14 system turn out to be discernibly different .",
    "the experimental signature for  is a single incident kaon track and a single outgoing pion track , with two missing neutrinos .",
    "the separation of this signal from the background requires that the particle identification and kinematics of the @xmath15 must be very well measured and any additional particles must be vetoed with high efficiency .    a drawing of the e787@xcite detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ f787_det ] .",
    "the detector is located in the c4 beam line at the ags .",
    "this beam line , low energy separated beam ( lesb3)@xcite , transports kaons of up to 830 mev / c . at 690",
    "mev / c it can transmit more than @xmath16/spill with a @xmath17 ratio of @xmath183:1 for 10@xmath19 protons on the production target .",
    "the @xmath20 are tracked down the beamline and stopped in a scintillating fiber target in the center of the detector .",
    "the decay @xmath21 are tracked through the target and drift chamber@xcite into the plastic scintillator range stack ( rs ) .",
    "the detector is located in a 1 t , solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "the two most significant backgrounds are the two dominant @xmath20 decay modes ,  ( k@xmath22 ) and  ( k@xmath23 ) , which produce mono - energetic charged particles .",
    "the search region for excludes these two kinematic peaks .",
    "the e787 detector uses redundant measures of the kinematics : momentum ( p ) , energy ( e ) and range ( r ) .",
    "the k@xmath22 can also be suppressed by vetoing on the @xmath24 photons , so the detector is surrounded by a nearly 4@xmath15 photon veto ( pv ) .",
    "the primary components of the pv are the barrel veto ( bv ) and endcap ( ec)@xcite , but , in fact , almost the entire detector not traversed by the @xmath25 is used as a veto .",
    "the k@xmath23 can also be suppressed by @xmath26 and by requiring that the @xmath15 decay to a @xmath27 in the rs .",
    "the entire  decay chain is observed with 500 mhz , 8-bit transient digitizers(td)@xcite sampling the output of the rs scintillators .",
    "the only other significant background comes from scattered beam pions or @xmath20 charge exchange ( cex ) .",
    "the primary tools for rejecting these events are good particle identification in the beam counters , identification of both the @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the fiber target , and the requirement that the @xmath21 track occur later than the @xmath20 track .    the search for  requires an identified @xmath20 to stop in the target followed , after a delay of at least 2 ns , by a single charged - particle track that is unaccompanied by any other decay product or beam particle .",
    "this particle must be identified as a @xmath21 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 between the @xmath31 and @xmath32 peaks . to elude rejection ,",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath31 events have to be reconstructed incorrectly in @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , any event with a muon has to have its track misidentified as a pion  the td s provide a suppression factor @xmath33 .",
    "events with photons , such as @xmath31 decays , are efficiently eliminated  the suppression of @xmath24 s is @xmath34 ( photon energy threshold of @xmath61 mev ) .",
    "a scattered beam pion can survive the analysis only by misidentification as a @xmath20 and if the track is mismeasured as delayed , or if the track is missed entirely by the beam counters after a valid @xmath20 stopped in the target .",
    "cex background events can survive only if the @xmath35 is produced at low enough energy to remain in the target for at least 2 ns , if there is no visible gap between the beam track and the observed @xmath21 track , and if the additional charged lepton evades detection .",
    "reliable estimation of backgrounds is one of the most important aspects of the measurement of  at the @xmath36 level . for each source of background",
    "two independent sets of cuts are established by taking advantage of the redundancy of detector measurements .",
    "one set of cuts is relaxed or inverted to enhance the background ( by up to three orders of magnitude ) so that the other group can be evaluated to determine its power for rejection . in this fashion backgrounds",
    "can be studied at sensitivities up to 1000 times greater than the experimental sensitivity . for example , @xmath32 ( including ) are studied by separately measuring the rejections of the td particle identification and kinematic cuts .",
    "the background from @xmath31 is evaluated by separately measuring the rejections of the photon detection and kinematic cuts .",
    "the background from beam pion scattering is evaluated by separately measuring the rejections of the beam counter and timing cuts .",
    "extensive measurements of @xmath20 charge exchange in the target were made in 1997 .",
    "this data combined with monte carlo simulation of semi - leptonic @xmath37 decays , allows the cex background to be determined .",
    "small correlations in the separate groups of cuts are investigated for each background source and corrected for if they existed .",
    "further confidence in the background estimates and in the measurements of the background distributions near the signal region is provided by extending the method described above to estimate the number of events expected with various degrees of cut loosening so as to allow higher levels of all background types .",
    "confronting these estimates with measurements from the full  data , where the two sets of cuts for each background type were relaxed simultaneously , tested the independence of the two sets of cuts . the background level for the 1995 data set , @xmath38 ,",
    "was measured to be 0.08 events . at the level of @xmath39 ,",
    "two events were observed where @xmath40 were expected , and at @xmath41 , 15 events were found where @xmath42 were expected . under detailed examination ,",
    "the events admitted by the relaxed cuts were consistent with being due to the known background sources . within the final signal region",
    ", additional background rejection capability is available .",
    "therefore , prior to looking in the signal region , several sets of increasingly tighter criteria were established , to be used only to interpret any events in the signal region .",
    "e787 published the first observation of the  decay@xcite , based on data from the 1995 run of the ags .",
    "the range and energy of event candidates passing all other cuts is shown in fig .",
    "[ 787_pnn1 ] .",
    "the box ( which encloses the upper 16.2% of the  phase space ) indicates the signal region .",
    "one event consistent with the decay  was observed .",
    "the expected number of background events from all sources was @xmath43 events ( branching ratio equivalent of @xmath44 ) .",
    "the separate levels of background were : k@xmath23=@xmath45 , k@xmath22=@xmath46 , beam-@xmath21=@xmath47 and cex=@xmath48 .",
    "this event was in a particularly clean region where the expected background was @xmath49 and which contained 55% of the acceptance of the full signal region .",
    "a reconstruction of the event is shown in fig .",

    "the kaon decayed to a pion at 23.9 ns , followed by a clean @xmath50 decay 27.0 ns later , as can be seen in the upper insert in fig .",
    "[ 787_pnn2 ] ; there was also a clean @xmath51 decay at 3201.1 ns .",
    "there was no significant activity anywhere else in the detector at the time of the @xmath20 decay .",
    "the lower insert in fig .",
    "[ 787_pnn2 ] shows one of the target fibers that contains the incident kaon track , yet does not lie on the outgoing @xmath21 track ; there is no activity at the @xmath20 decay time .",
    "the branching ratio for  implied by the observation of this event is b ( ) = 4.2@xmath52 .",
    "the e787 experiment has had four runs during 199598 .",
    "the typical conditions for the 1995 run were 13 tp / spill , 5.3 mhz of incident @xmath20 , a stopped kaon rate of 1.2 m / spill , a deadtime of 25% , and an acceptance of 0.16% .",
    "the acceptance has been measured to be 60% of the acceptance at zero rate .",
    "the rates in most detector elements have been measured to be proportional to the incident flux and not to the stopped kaon flux .",
    "this implies that the sensitivity increases with increasing fraction of stopped kaons / incident kaons .",
    "therefore e787 has lowered the momentum of the incident kaons in subsequent years , increasing the sensitivity without increasing the rates in most detector elements .",
    "in addition , the duty factor of the ags has been increased from 37% at the start of 1995 to 55% at the end of 1998 .",
    "improvements in the online trigger efficiency , live time from trigger and daq upgrades@xcite , and acceptance from running at lower momentum also contribute to the enhanced sensitivity in later years .",
    "a summary of the e787 sensitivity , including the published 1995 result , is shown in table  [ tab_sens ] , along with some of the running conditions .",
    ".running conditions for e787 .",
    "the number of stopped kaons with the detector live(kb@xmath53 ) is the online measure of the experimental sensitivity . as the kaon momentum",
    "is lowered the fraction of incident kaons that stop in the target(sf ) increases .",
    "the duty factor(df ) of the ags steadily increased .",
    "the single event sensitivity(s.e.s . ) is measured from the 1995 set and estimated for the later years based on kb@xmath53 and the acceptance calculated from the detector rates . the background levels ( bck ) for 199698 are estimated from the reanalysis of the 1995 data .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,>,^ , < , < \" , ]     the total gain in sensitivity per hour will be 613 times over the e787 published result on the 1995 data set .",
    "all of the measurements of deadtime and acceptance as a function of rate ; and of the stopping fraction and kaon flux have been included in a calculation of the optimum running conditions .",
    "the sensitivity of the 1995 conditions is @xmath54/hr and for e949 is @xmath55/hr , not including the plans for reoptimizing for higher rates or the phase space below the k@xmath22 peak .",
    "the prospects for further improvement in the determination of b ( ) are bright .",
    "the first observation of this rare and interesting decay has recently been published .",
    "the data on hand , or soon to be available , from the e787 experiment , should provide almost an order of magnitude more sensitivity .",
    "the recently approved experiment e949 should reach at least a factor of five further than e787 and make a very interesting measurement of @xmath12 .",
    "there is also a proposal , ckm , at the fnal main injector , to push even further , to @xmath56 by looking for the decay in flight .",
