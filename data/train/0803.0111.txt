    "it is listed as one of the millennium problems of the 21st century @xcite .",
    "one of the most significant recent developments related to the above problem may be the discovery of lax pairs of two- and three- dimensional euler equations ( ees ) which are the limit cases of the ns equation for a large reynolds number @xcite .",
    "actually , for the two - dimensional ee , the lax pair given in @xcite is weak ( see remark 2 of the next section ) while the lax pairs of the three - dimensional ee are strong ( see theorems 3 and 4 of @xcite which can be proved in a similar way as theorem 1 of this paper ) .",
    "hence , the ees are ( weak ) lax integrable under the meaning that they possess ( weak ) lax pairs , and subsequently the ns equations with large reynolds number are singular perturbations of ( weak ) lax - integrable models .",

    "_    lie group theory is one of the most effective methods of seeking exact and analytic solutions of physical systems .",

    "ii , we first establish a simple direct method to find a general group transformation theorem for the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ee , then utilize the theorem in some special cases to obtain some solution theorems which lead to a quite general symmetric vortex solution with some arbitrary functions .",
    "the applications of the exact vortices and circumfluence solutions are given in section iii .",
    "it is indicated that the solutions can explain the tropical cyclone ( tc ) eye , the track , and the relation between the track and the background wind .",
    "the tc tracks can thus be predicted by the relation . in section iv , beginning with a general symmetry group theorem , the dt in @xcite with zero spectral parameter is extended to that with arbitrary spectral parameter .",
    "the last section is a short summary and discussion .",
    "in the traditional theory , to find the lie symmetry group of a given nonlinear physical system , one has to first find its lie symmetry algebra and then use the lie s first fundamental theorem to solve an  initial \" problem .",
    "if one utilizes the standard lie group theory to study the symmetry group of the two - dimensional ee , it is easy to find that the only possible symmetry transformations are the arbitrary time - dependent space and stream translations , constant time translation , space rotation and scaling @xcite .",

    "the weak dt theorem has been used to obtain some types of exact solutions such as the solitary waves , the conoid periodic waves , the rossby waves , and many kinds of bessel waves . here",

    "the special solution theorem 4 gives a quite general exact explicit solution which covers many kinds of possible vortices and circumfluence such as the lump - type vortices , dromion - type vortices , ring solitons , etc .",
    "the vortex and circumfluence solutions may have applications in various physical fields mentioned in the introduction and refs .",

    "the discovery of the general group theorem may lead to the discovery of various interesting exact solutions which can be applied to many real physical fields .",
    "this paper is just the beginning study in this aspect .",
    "there are various important problems should be studied further .",
    "for instance , the possible solutions from the general group theorem 2 are only discussed in three very special cases : ( i ) the constant vorticity seed ( corollary 1 ) , ( ii ) the zero spectral parameters without the gauge transformation ( corollary 2 , theorems 3 and 4 ) , and ( iii ) the pure weak dt case ( theorem 5 ) .    in this paper , we only discuss the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ee .",
    "two types of lax pairs of the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ee have also been given in @xcite and some special dts of these lax pairs have also been given in @xcite .",
    "however , these dts have not yet been utilized to find exact solutions of the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ee .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding symmetry groups similar to that of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ee given in this paper have not yet been discussed .    the lax pair and",
    "then the dt found in this paper have only weak meaning . whether the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ee is integrable under some stronger meanings [ similar to those of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ee ] is still open .",
    "the more general applications of the vortex solutions given in this paper both in atmospheric dynamics and in other physical fields deserve more investigations .",
    "especially , to describe the hurricane more effectively and accurately , some other important factors such as the coriolis force and the viscosity of the fluid must be considered .",
