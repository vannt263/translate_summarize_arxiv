    "this paper is devoted to the analytic continuation of three - dimensional chern - simons gauge theory as a function of its coupling parameters .",
    "one motivation for this study concerns three - dimensional quantum gravity , which plausibly has at least some sort of relationship to three - dimensional chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath3 . in that context",
    ", euclidean quantum gravity is obtained by analytic continuation to imaginary values of the coupling parameter @xmath4 that is introduced in section [ overview ] . that we will discuss in section [ sing ] is at least a cousin of the `` chiral point '' of three - dimensional gravity , which has been much studied recently @xcite .",
    "] however , for imaginary @xmath4 , the chern - simons path integral , like the euclidean quantum gravity path integral in any dimension , does not appear to be convergent .",
    "our analysis in this paper will explain how to make sense of this sort of path integral , at least in the chern - simons case .",
    "another motivation is to understand aspects of the jones polynomial of knots , all statements about knots in this paper have rather immediate analogs for links , but for brevity we will refer to knots . ] and its generalizations that have not yet been explained from the point of view of three - dimensional gauge theory .",
    "the jones polynomial of a knot was originally defined as a laurent polynomial in a complex variable @xmath5  a rational function of @xmath5 with poles only at @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "chern - simons gauge theory with gauge group @xmath8 ( or another compact lie group ) reproduces the jones polynomial , and its generalizations , at values of @xmath5 of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath0 is a positive integer , and @xmath10 ( which is 2 for @xmath8 ) is the dual coxeter number of the gauge group .",
    "the jones polynomial and related invariants are determined by their values for these special values of @xmath5 , but it would be desirable to have a gauge theory explanation of the existence of a natural analytic continuation .",
    "it has generally been expected that the explanation has something to do with the relation between chern - simons theories with gauge groups @xmath8 or @xmath3 , but a really clear picture has not been available .",
    "a better understanding appears to require analytic continuation of chern - simons theory beyond the values of the parameters at which the path integral can be most simply understood .",
    "finally , in the last decade or more , striking new results have been obtained @xcite about the analytic continuation of invariants related to the jones polynomial .",
    "( a useful review is @xcite ; partial physics - based explanations with some relevance to the present paper are @xcite . while it is impractical to give complete references on chern - simons theory , some contributions comparing the asymptotic or in some cases exact behavior of the chern - simons partition function to geometry , but not focusing on analytic continuation , are @xcite . )",
    "the colored jones polynomial @xmath11 of a knot is interpreted in chern - simons gauge theory in terms of the expectation value of a wilson loop operator associated to the @xmath12-dimensional representation of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath13 , and consider the behavior of @xmath11 in a scaling limit with @xmath12 tending to infinity for fixed @xmath14 .",
    "the behavior of this limit for certain values of @xmath14 can be naturally understood in @xmath8 chern - simons theory , but many of the more recent results certainly appear to be more directly related to the theory with gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "for example , for @xmath14 near 1 , and at least for some knots , the large @xmath12 behavior appears to be dominated by an @xmath3-valued flat connection that does not take values in @xmath8 .",
    "although there has not been a completely clear picture of how and why the scaling limit of @xmath11 should be related to @xmath3 chern - simons theory , the idea that there is such a relationship has been a fruitful source of new ideas and generalizations @xcite .",
    "again , it has been clear that a fuller picture will require a better understanding of the analytic continuation of chern - simons theory .    in this paper",
    ", we will definitely not obtain complete answers to all of the above questions , and among other things we do not have a general answer concerning the volume conjecture .",
    "( it is true , as will become clear , if a certain integer - valued coefficient is always nonzero , but we do not know why this would always be so . )",
    "but we do hope to make some things clearer .",
    "we show that critical points of the analytically continued chern - simons functional should be used to determine  by steepest descent ",
    "suitable integration cycles for the quantum path integral . for a given value of the coupling parameters",
    ", not all critical points should be included ; doing so would lead to immediate contradiction with known facts about the knot polynomials .",
    "instead , one should start with a real integration cycle for real coupling and then , as one varies the coupling into the complex plane , one varies the integration cycle so that the integral remains convergent . in the process ,",
    "one encounters subtle stokes phenomena that govern the appearance and disappearance of critical points .",
    "the stokes phenomena can be described , in principle , by solving steepest descent equations that in the context of chern - simons theory amount to four - dimensional elliptic differential equations that generalize the instanton equation .",
    "this gives a suitable framework for analytically continuing the @xmath3 chern - simons theory as a function of its coupling parameter , and for better understanding its relation to the @xmath8 theory .",
    "section [ overview ] of the paper is devoted to a more complete overview of some of these matters .",
    "in section [ stokes ] , we describe the analytic continuation of oscillatory integrals in finite dimensions and their analysis by steepest descent .",
    "this is an application of the framework of @xcite , which is reviewed here for convenience .",
    "various aspects of this framework have been applied to quantum field theory from different points of view @xcite .",
    "floer theory ( for reviews see for instance @xcite ) is a prototype for the application of morse theory to middle - dimensional cohomology of function spaces , which appears in our approach to chern - simons gauge theory .    in section [ backtocs ]",
    ", we apply what we have learned to the analytic continuation of chern - simons gauge theory on a generic three - manifold .",
    "a striking result emerges : the gradient flow equations relevant to analytic continuation of three - dimensional chern - simons theory actually have four - dimensional symmetry .    in section [ anajones ]",
    ", we consider the special case of knot invariants in @xmath1 , where stronger conclusions are possible because , in the absence of the knot , there are no non - trivial flat connections .",
    "the main examples considered in section [ anajones ] are the trefoil knot and the figure - eight knot . in each case",
    ", we consider the semi - classical limit of the colored jones polynomial , keeping fixed the conjugacy class of the monodromy of a flat connection around the knot .",
    "( in other words , we consider the limit mentioned above of @xmath15 with fixed @xmath14 . )",
    "the technique that we use to describe the stokes phenomena relies on analyzing the singularities of the moduli space of flat connections  that is , the special values of the monodromy at which flat connections that are generically distinct become coincident .",
    "the semiclassical behavior near such a special value is interesting in itself ; it can be modeled by a finite - dimensional integral associated to the relevant singularity .",
    "we analyze several examples of such singularities and compare the results to what has been found in the mathematical literature in studies of the semiclassical limit of the colored jones polynomial . for the trefoil knot , though many interesting questions remain , the stokes phenomena that we analyze suffice to determine the integration cycle of the analytically continued chern - simons path integral for all values of @xmath14 . for the figure - eight knot",
    ", we primarily determine what happens close to the real @xmath14 axis .",
    "in both cases , our analysis of the stokes phenomena suffices to explain the validity of the volume conjecture .",
    "finally , in section [ fourfive ] , we make a few remarks on a four or five - dimensional interpretation of what we have learned , with the possible goal of a new understanding of khovanov homology .",
    "we begin by considering chern - simons gauge theory with the gauge group @xmath16 a complex lie group such as @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath17 be a connection on a @xmath16-bundle @xmath18 over a three - manifold @xmath19 .",
    "such a connection has a complex - valued chern - simons invariant @xmath20 which we have normalized to be gauge - invariant modulo @xmath21 .",
    "( for @xmath22 , the symbol @xmath23 denotes the trace in the @xmath24-dimensional representation . in general , it denotes a suitably normalized quadratic form on the lie algebra @xmath25 of @xmath16 . ) just as in the case of a compact group , @xmath26 is gauge - invariant modulo @xmath21 .",
    "the indeterminacy in @xmath26 is real , and is the same as it would be if @xmath16 were replaced by a maximal compact subgroup @xmath27 , because @xmath16 is contractible onto @xmath27 .",
    "comes from its change in going around a loop in the space of connections modulo gauge transformations , and this change only depends on the homotopy class of the loop . since @xmath16 is contractible to @xmath27 , any family of @xmath28-valued connections on @xmath19 can be deformed to a family of @xmath29-valued connections , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the lie algebras of @xmath16 and @xmath27 .",
    "so the indeterminacy in the chern - simons function for gauge group @xmath16 reduces to that for gauge group @xmath27 . ]",
    "thus the imaginary part of @xmath26 is actually a well - defined real number , while its real part takes values in @xmath30 . to obtain a quantum field theory",
    ", we wish to start with a classical action @xmath31 that is a linear combination of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the quantum theory is based upon integrating the expression @xmath34 , and for this function to be well - defined , @xmath31 must be defined mod @xmath21 .",
    "because of the indeterminacy in @xmath32 , its coefficient must be an integer , while ( if the only desired condition is to ensure that @xmath34 is a well - defined complex - valued function ) the coefficient of @xmath33 may be an arbitrary complex number .",
    "the action therefore has the general form @xmath35 alternatively , we can write @xmath36 with @xmath37    there is more to life , however , than making sure that @xmath34 is a well - defined complex - valued function .",
    "we also want to integrate this function over the space @xmath38 of gauge fields modulo gauge transformations .",
    "this makes sense straightforwardly only if @xmath4 is real , for then @xmath31 is real and the integrand @xmath34 of the path integral is bounded .",
    "the path integral @xmath39 is then an infinite - dimensional oscillatory integral . in this respect , it is like any lorentz signature feynman integral ( though here we are doing topological field theory rather than quantum field theory on a manifold of lorentz signature ) .",
    "if @xmath4 is not real , the path integral is not convergent ; our task is to make sense of it anyway .",
    "a much simpler prototype of this problem is a finite - dimensional oscillatory integral such as the one that defines the airy function : @xmath40 for real @xmath41 , this integral converges , though not absolutely so , because of rapid oscillations at infinity ; when @xmath41 becomes complex , it must be defined by a process of analytic continuation .",
    "the airy integral will serve as a useful practice case in section [ stokes ] .",
    "the following slightly more elaborate example is also useful .",
    "introduce a complex variable @xmath42 and a complex - valued polynomial @xmath43 now consider the integral @xmath44 and @xmath45 corresponding to the terms @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the action ( [ ork ] ) .",
    "we stress that no contour integral is intended in ( [ omor ] )  a contour integral could scarcely be intended here as the integrand is not holomorphic ! rather , if @xmath48 , with real @xmath49 , we integrate separately over @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the integration measure being @xmath52 .    a finite - dimensional analog of analytically continuing chern - simons theory with complex gauge group as a function of @xmath4 is to analytically continue the airy function @xmath53 to complex @xmath41 .",
    "an even closer analog is to analytically continue the integral @xmath54 to let @xmath55 be independent of @xmath56 . by this , we mean the following .",
    "define a new polynomial @xmath57 and generalize the integral @xmath54 to @xmath58 coincides with the original @xmath54 if @xmath59 ( by which we mean that @xmath60 for all @xmath61 ) .",
    "the natural way to analytically continue the airy function in @xmath41 is to let @xmath62 become a complex variable and to deform the integration contour away from the real axis so that the integral remains convergent as @xmath41 varies .",
    "similarly , to extend the definition of @xmath63 to @xmath64 , we analytically continue , treating @xmath42 and @xmath65  or equivalently @xmath50 and @xmath51 , defined by @xmath48 , @xmath66  as independent complex variables . denoting the independent complex variables as @xmath42 and @xmath67 ( rather than @xmath42 and @xmath65 ) , the analytically continued integral is @xmath68 the integral is over a two - dimensional real integration cycle @xmath69 , which is the real slice @xmath70 if @xmath71 , and in general must be deformed as @xmath56 and @xmath72 vary so that the integral remains convergent .",
    "this then is the framework that we will have to imitate to understand the analytic continuation of chern - simons theory with a complex gauge group .",
    "just as we promoted @xmath65 to a complex variable @xmath67 that is independent of @xmath42 , we will have to promote @xmath73 to a new @xmath16-valued connection @xmath74 that is independent of @xmath17 .",
    "thus we consider the classical theory with independent @xmath16-valued connections @xmath17 and @xmath74 ( we recall that @xmath16 is a complex lie group such as @xmath3 ) and action @xmath75 then we have to find an appropriate integration cycle @xmath76 in the path integral @xmath77 the cycle @xmath76 must be equivalent to @xmath78 if @xmath4 is real , and in general must be obtained by deforming that one as @xmath4 varies so that the integral remains convergent .",
    "( we also have to learn how to deal with gauge invariance when @xmath17 and @xmath79 are treated as independent . )",
    "finding a suitable integration cycle in the infinite - dimensional path integral of chern - simons gauge theory may seem hopeless at first sight .",
    "what saves the day is that suitable integration contours can be found by morse theory and steepest descent ( or in a different language , via picard - lefschetz theory ) .",
    "the facts we need for understanding oscillatory integrals have been described in @xcite ( and the aspiration of applying this approach to feynman integrals is stated in @xcite , p. 321 ) .",
    "section [ stokes ] of the present paper is devoted to a hopefully self - contained exposition of this approach , with an emphasis on the aspects that we need in chern - simons theory .",
    "the basic idea of the theory is to associate potential integration cycles to components of the critical point set of the extended action @xmath80 .",
    "what makes it practical to use this formalism in chern - simons theory is that the critical points are accessible .",
    "as long as @xmath81 and @xmath82 are both non - zero , the critical point equation derived from the analytically continued action ( [ morko ] ) is @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the curvatures of the two connections .",
    "hence a critical point is just a pair of flat connections , corresponding to a pair of homomorphisms from the fundamental group of @xmath19 to the complex lie group @xmath16 .",
    "( we postpone to section [ backtocs ] an important detail about the value of the chern - simons invariant at a critical point . )",
    "hence in chern - simons theory on a given three - manifold @xmath19 , the critical points can be effectively described ; this is typically not true for oscillatory feynman integrals .    for simplicity , we assume until section [ mancrit ] that the critical points are isolated points .",
    "let @xmath86 be the set of critical points and denote the critical points as @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "then to each @xmath87 , we attach an integration cycle @xmath89 that is obtained by downward or gradient flow from @xmath90 , taking the real part of the action as a morse function .",
    "( details are explained in section [ stokes ] . )",
    "the @xmath89 , which are known as lefschetz thimbles , are constructed so that the integral over @xmath89 always converges , regardless of the choice of @xmath90 or of the parameters in the action .",
    "any suitable integration cycle @xmath69 for the sort of integral that we are interested in is equivalent to a linear combination of the @xmath89 with integer coefficients : @xmath91 the coefficients @xmath92 can themselves be computed via morse theory .",
    "to do this , one attaches to each critical point @xmath87 another cycle @xmath93 by upwards gradient flow starting from @xmath87 .",
    "the expansion coefficients in eqn .",
    "( [ lincom ] ) can be computed as the intersection pairing of the integration cycle @xmath69 with the @xmath93 : @xmath94    one might naively think that all critical points would contribute to the integral with @xmath95 ( or with @xmath96 , since in general the @xmath89 do not have natural orientations ) , but this can not be so .",
    "for example , in chern - simons theory with real @xmath4 , there are complex critical points at which the action @xmath31 has a negative imaginary part ; their inclusion would lead to a pathologically wrong exponential growth of the partition function for large real @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , for real @xmath4 , with @xmath97 taken to be the real cycle @xmath98 defined by @xmath99 , real critical points ( whose contributions to the path integral are oscillatory ) all have @xmath95 , but critical points that would make exponentially large contributions to the path integral have @xmath100 .",
    "these statements will be deduced from ( [ pincom ] ) .",
    "however , there is no simple formula for @xmath92 for critical points whose contributions to the real @xmath4 path integral are exponentially small .",
    "once one expresses the integration cycle @xmath97 in terms of critical point cycles for real values of the chern - simons coupling constant @xmath4 ( or of the appropriate parameters in the other examples ) via a formula @xmath101 , the next step is to make an analytic continuation in @xmath4 .",
    "there is no problem in defining the critical points @xmath87 and the corresponding lefschetz thimbles @xmath89 for any generic value of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , in chern - simons theory , the critical point equation ( [ ozorkp ] ) is independent of @xmath4 ( except at @xmath102 , where @xmath81 or @xmath82 vanishes ) .",
    "the @xmath89 do depend on @xmath4 ( their definition by steepest descent makes use of the action , which depends on @xmath4 ) , but their definition ensures that the path integral over @xmath89 is always convergent , even when @xmath4 has an imaginary part .    one can find the right coefficients in the expansion @xmath103 by starting at real @xmath4 , where one knows what to do , and then continuously evolving in @xmath4 . here , however , one runs into the main subtlety of the theory : stokes phenomena .",
    "as one varies @xmath4 , one crosses stokes curves at which both the lefschetz thimbles @xmath89 and the coefficients @xmath92 jump , in such a way that the homology cycle @xmath104 is locally constant .",
    "such jumping can occur when there are paths of steepest descent that connect two critical points .",
    "the flow by steepest descent has a conserved quantity ( the imaginary part of the holomorphic function whose real part is taken as the morse function ) , and a flow between two critical points is possible only when this quantity takes equal values at the two critical points .",
    "this is reviewed in section [ stokes ] .",
    "after taking the stokes phenomena into account , one can obtain a recipe for how the @xmath92 evolve as @xmath4 varies in the complex plane .",
    "this then gives , finally , a way to define the analytic continuation in @xmath4 of the chern - simons path integral for the case that the gauge group is a complex lie group .      at this stage",
    ", it is very illuminating to ask what sort of singularities the analytically continued theory has as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "generically , the analytic continuation of an oscillatory integral grows exponentially as the appropriate complex parameter goes to infinity in certain directions in the complex plane .",
    "the appropriate parameters are @xmath4 for complex chern - simons theory , @xmath41 for the airy function , and the coefficients of the polynomials @xmath56 and @xmath72 in our other example .    because of this exponential growth",
    ", the analytically continued chern - simons path integral has an essential singularity at @xmath105 .",
    "generically , there is in addition an ordinary monodromy around @xmath105 ; it results from the fact that , by virtue of the stokes phenomena , the integration contour @xmath97 does not return to itself under continuation around @xmath105 .",
    "apart from an essential singularity at infinity , will analytically continued chern - simons theory have other singularities as a function of @xmath4 ?",
    "the answer to this question is that one should expect singularities at @xmath106 , where the action ( [ ork ] ) becomes holomorphic or antiholomorphic .",
    "an oversimplified prototype of this singularity is the gaussian integral @xmath107 with singularities at @xmath108 or @xmath109 .",
    "( the integral is defined by analytic continuation starting from an oscillatory gaussian integral at @xmath110 . )",
    "this example is oversimplified because the analytically continued exponent , which is @xmath111 , has only a unique critical point , the one at @xmath112 . in chern - simons theory , there are in general many critical points @xmath87 . in general",
    "there are distinct critical points that have the same action at @xmath102 , and as a result many stokes curves pass through the points @xmath102 .",
    "hence the singularities at @xmath102 will be much more complicated than in the gaussian example .",
    "these singularities will not be analyzed in this paper , but it will not be surprising if the analytic continuation of chern - simons theory in general should be defined on the universal cover of the complex @xmath4-plane , with the points at @xmath102 ( and @xmath113 ) omitted . thus the partition function would be really a function not of @xmath4 but of a certain dilogarithm of @xmath4 .      now we will discuss the analytic continuation of chern - simons theory with a compact gauge group .",
    "we consider it first in a naive way and then in relation to the theory with a complex gauge group .",
    "in chern - simons gauge theory on a three - manifold @xmath19 with a compact gauge group @xmath27 , the gauge field is a connection @xmath114 on an @xmath27-bundle @xmath115 . in terms of the chern - simons function @xmath116 , which we normalize as usual to be well - defined modulo @xmath117 , the action is  @xmath118 , where @xmath0 is taken to be an integer so that the integrand @xmath119 of the path integral is well - defined",
    ". then one defines the path integral as the integral over the space a variant in which one takes @xmath120 to be the quotient of the space of connections by the group of based gauge transformations is also useful .",
    "( a based gauge transformation is one that equals 1 at a prescribed point ; the advantage of dividing only by this group is that it acts freely , so dividing by it produces no singularities . ) in this variant , one must divide the path integral by a constant factor , the volume of the residual group of gauge transformations .",
    "another important variant arises in working out the contribution to the path integral from a given gauge orbit of flat connections on @xmath19 ; here one may take @xmath121 to be a transversal to the given orbit in the space of all connections on @xmath18 .",
    "when we speak loosely of @xmath122 as the space of connections mod gauge transformations , we refer to any of these variants that may be most convenient in a given context . ]",
    "@xmath120 of connections mod gauge transformations : @xmath123 in the presence of a knot @xmath124 labeled by a representation @xmath125 , one includes a holonomy factor and considers the integral : @xmath126    as written , the integral does not make sense unless @xmath127 is an integer .",
    "indeed , as @xmath116 is defined only modulo @xmath21 , the expression @xmath128 makes sense as a function on @xmath122 if and only if @xmath129 .",
    "can we evade this limitation ?",
    "a naive way to try to do so is to replace @xmath122 by its universal cover to be the smallest cover of @xmath122 on which the chern - simons function @xmath116 makes sense as a real - valued function .",

    "@xmath130 is the quotient of the space of connections by the group of topologically trivial gauge transformations .",
    "the expression @xmath128 is invariant under such gauge transformations , so it makes sense as a function on @xmath130 .",
    "however , its integral vanishes for @xmath131 , since the integrand transforms with a non - trivial phase under the deck transformations associated to the cover @xmath132 .",
    "to cure this problem , we complexify the gauge field , replacing @xmath114 by a complex - valued connection @xmath17 .",

    "since we assume that @xmath97 lies at @xmath733 , the condition that @xmath996 lies in @xmath97 implies in particular that @xmath997 at @xmath329 . subtracting this from the bulk equation @xmath998 , which is one of the flow equations , we find that the covariant normal derivative of @xmath930 vanishes at @xmath329 : @xmath999 .",
    "this is enough to justify integration by parts in showing that @xmath951 , defined in ( [ polyz ] ) , vanishes .",

    "such choices of sign and orientation are discussed in , for example , @xcite in the context of finite - dimensional morse theory and floer cohomology . ] of @xmath989 .",
    "summing the contributions of all critical points , we get the integer @xmath92 that appears in the expansion @xmath1003 .",
    "let us compare the definition of @xmath92 to the definition of the most basic invariant in donaldson theory of smooth four - manifolds .",
    "this invariant is defined in a situation in which the index of the operator @xmath1004 that arises in linearizing the yang - mills instanton equation on @xmath260 is zero . under this circumstance , for a generic metric on @xmath260 , the instanton equation has finitely many solutions , and donaldson s invariant is defined by summing over all such solutions with a weight given by the sign of @xmath1005 . obviously , @xmath92 is a close cousin of this , with the usual instanton equations replaced by the flow equations for a complex - valued connection .",
    "so far , the elliptic nature of the flow equations has enabled us to express a given cycle @xmath97 in terms of the lefschetz thimbles @xmath89 , according to eqn .",
    "( [ totto ] ) .",
    "the other important application of the flow equation is to describe stokes phenomena .",
    "here we must consider complete flow lines between two critical points corresponding to semistable flat connections @xmath142 and @xmath1006 on @xmath19 .",
    "we must define an invariant @xmath484 that controls what happens in crossing a stokes ray at which there are flows from @xmath142 to @xmath1006 .",
    "we consider the flow equations on @xmath1007 , with the requirement that @xmath1008 for @xmath325 and @xmath1009 for @xmath164 .",
    "further we require that @xmath1010 at both ends .",
    "the index of @xmath953 still vanishes , but now there is a new ingredient : the flow equations are invariant under the group @xmath1011 of translations in the @xmath762 direction , but a solution with @xmath659 can not be translation - invariant .",
    "so any solution with @xmath659 will have to come in a one - parameter family , and hence it is impossible to have an isolated solution .",
    "this clashes with the fact that the index is 0 , and means that generically there are no flows from @xmath142 to @xmath1006 .",
    "we know an independent reason for this : the flow equation has a conserved quantity , namely the imaginary part of the holomorphic function @xmath1012 . for generic @xmath41 ,",
    "conservation of @xmath346 makes a flow from @xmath142 to @xmath1006 impossible .",
    "the condition for a stokes ray is precisely that a flow from @xmath142 to @xmath1006 is consistent with the conservation law .",
    "taking @xmath1013 , a stokes ray is characterized by some condition @xmath1014 . instead of regarding @xmath152 as a constant in our flow equations ( [ kweqns ] ) and ( [ zweq ] ) , regard it as a variable that takes values in a small interval near @xmath1014 .",
    "this adds one variable to the problem without adding any new equations , and the index of the linearized problem is now 1 .",
    "thus the moduli space of solutions should generically be one - dimensional  corresponding to families of solutions , obtained from each other by the action of @xmath1015 , that appear at @xmath1014 . to get back to a problem with zero index , we can identify two field configurations that differ by the action of @xmath1015 .",
    "this removes one variable , and the number of solutions is now generically finite .",
    "weighting the solutions by the sign of the determinant of the operator @xmath1016 that appears in the linearization around a solution , we arrive at the desired invariant @xmath484 .    concretely , adding one variable and removing another and replacing @xmath953 by @xmath1016 has the following effect .",
    "suppose we set @xmath1014 and find a solution of the flow equations .",
    "the linearization @xmath953 around a solution of the flow equations will have a zero mode @xmath1017 , generated by the action of @xmath1015 on the given solution .",

    "now vary @xmath152 away from @xmath1019 .",
    "the eigenvector @xmath1017 of @xmath953 can be deformed with @xmath152 so as to remain an eigenvector , but its eigenvalue @xmath1020 generically vanishes only at @xmath1014 . replacing @xmath953 by @xmath1016 means that in evaluating the determinant at @xmath1014 , the factor that comes from the eigenvector @xmath1017 is not @xmath1021 but @xmath1022 , which is generically not zero .",
    "so @xmath1023 is generically nonzero and its sign is the contribution of a given @xmath1015-orbit of flow lines to @xmath484 .",
    "we have defined an invariant @xmath92 associated to the flow equations on a half - line , and another invariant @xmath484 associated to the same equations on the full real line .",
    "the relation between these invariants is that in crossing a stokes ray at which there is a net number @xmath484 of downward flow lines from @xmath142 to @xmath1006 , the invariant @xmath521 jumps by @xmath1024 . as explained in the discussion of eqn .",

    ", it seems most concise to describe the jumping phenomenon in terms of the behavior of the coefficients .    just as in morse theory with finitely many variables",
    ", the jumping happens because at @xmath1014 the set of points that can be reached by downward flow from @xmath142 ceases to be closed ",
    "its closure contains @xmath1006 .",
    "a downward flow from @xmath97 to @xmath1006 can split into a pair of flows , first from @xmath97 to @xmath142 and then from @xmath142 to @xmath1006 .",
    "this leads to the `` wall - crossing '' behavior @xmath1027 .",
    "see for example @xcite in the context of flows with finitely many variables .",
    "ellipticity means that such statements about morse theory carry over to the infinite - dimensional case .",
    "this is an important fact in the context of floer theory ( of three - manifolds and of loop spaces of symplectic manifolds ) .",
    "see for example @xcite for reviews .",
    "hopefully the usual proofs in the context of floer theory can be adapted to the present situation .",
    "l beginning in section [ spurz ] , we described the analytic continuation of chern - simons knot invariants in a rather informal way . to make this more precise ,",
    "we need to incorporate in the language of oscillatory integrals the holonomy functions that are included in the path integral to define knot invariants . how to do this",
    "has been briefly explained in @xcite , section 3.3 , and in @xcite , pp .",
    "1218 - 9 , and in much more detail in @xcite .",
    "we consider first the case of a compact gauge group @xmath27 with connection @xmath114 .    for a knot @xmath124 labeled by a representation @xmath125",
    ", the basic factor is @xmath1028 according to the borel - weil - bott theorem , letting @xmath292 denote a maximal torus in @xmath27 , the representation @xmath125 can be constructed as the space of holomorphic sections of a certain holomorphic line bundle @xmath1029 over the flag manifold @xmath1030 .",
    "this means that there is a quantum mechanical problem with @xmath27 symmetry for which the space of physical states is the representation @xmath125 .",
    "writing a path integral representation of this system and coupling it to the gauge field @xmath114 will give the representation that we need of the holonomy function .    the line bundle @xmath1031 admits an essentially unique @xmath27-invariant connection that we will call @xmath1032 .",
    "we can describe as follows a classical problem with @xmath125 symmetry whose quantization leads , in view of the borel - weil - bott theorem , to the representation @xmath125 .",
    "let @xmath1033 be a one - manifold and let @xmath1034 be a map .",
    "on the space of such maps , we define an action @xmath1035 . for @xmath1033 a circle ,",
    "this is defined mod @xmath21 , so that @xmath1036 is well - defined .",
    "( if instead @xmath1033 has boundaries , @xmath1036 is not a complex number but a transition amplitude between quantum wavefunctions ; we will not need the details here . ) since @xmath1037 is invariant under reparametrizations of @xmath1033 , this system is a topological field theory in the one - dimensional sense ; the hamiltonian vanishes .",
    "the basic path integral for this system is the integral over maps @xmath1034 : @xmath1038 for @xmath1033 a circle , the value of the path integral can be determined by observing that the path integral determines a trace in the physical hilbert space . the physical hilbert space is simply the representation @xmath125 , and as the hamiltonian vanishes , the trace is simply the trace of the identity operator .",
    "so the value of the path integral is @xmath1039 , the dimension of the representation @xmath125 .",
    "we want to generalize this to couple to a gauge field @xmath114 and to compute the trace not of the identity operator but of the holonomy operator @xmath1040 . to do this",
    ", we simply couple the gauge field @xmath114 to the @xmath832 field in a gauge - invariant fashion .",
    "quantum mechanically , we would couple @xmath114 to the matrices that generate the action of @xmath27 in the representation @xmath125 .",
    "the classical limit of these matrices is the moment function @xmath1041 associated to the action of @xmath27 on @xmath1030 .",
    "@xmath1041 is a map from @xmath1030 to the dual of the lie algebra @xmath29 .",

    "( a more intrinsic description of the geometry involved in defining this action can be found in @xcite ; for more detail see also @xcite . )",
    "thus we arrive at a path integral representation of the holonomy : @xmath1048    now we can rewrite the basic formula ( [ mydef ] ) for the chern - simons invariant of a knot in a convenient form : @xmath1049 what we have gained is that now , although we are integrating over a larger number of variables , the integrand is simpler : it is just the exponential of a local functional of the fields . in other words",
    ", we have reduced the problem to an oscillatory integral ( with more variables ) , and we can apply the morse theory machinery rather as if no knot were present .    as usual ,",
    "the main step in analytic continuation is to extend the action to a holomorphic function of complex variables .",
    "we analytically continue the connection @xmath114 to a complex - valued connection @xmath17 and we replace the flag manifold @xmath1030 with @xmath1050 , where @xmath1051 is a complex maximal torus in @xmath133 .",
    "the analytically continued integral thus takes the form @xmath1052 where @xmath97 is an integration cycle in the space of fields @xmath1053 .    any integration cycle @xmath97 , including the original real integration cycle of chern - simons theory in the presence of a knot ,",
    "can be expressed in terms of lefschetz thimbles in the usual way .",
    "such cycles are convenient for several reasons .",
    "one reason , discussed in section [ asyc ] , is that it is straightforward to determine the asymptotic value of the integral over such a cycle , in the semiclassical region in which the action is large .",
    "what is this region ? in the absence of a knot , the action is proportional to @xmath0 , so the semiclassical region is the region of large @xmath0 . in the presence of a knot labeled by a representation @xmath125 with highest weight @xmath1054 ,",
    "the action @xmath1055 is proportional to @xmath1054 , since it is linear in @xmath1032 and @xmath1041 which are both proportional to @xmath1054 .",
    "so in the presence of a knot , the natural semiclassical limit is obtained by taking @xmath0 and @xmath1054 to infinity with a fixed ratio .",
    "the morse theory machinery will enable us to understand the asymptotic behavior of the analytically continued chern - simons path integral in this limit .      in the presence of a knot @xmath124 , the classical equation for @xmath114 receives an extra contribution and",
    "no longer asserts simply that @xmath1056 is flat .",
    "rather , the equation receives an extra contribution that is supported on @xmath124 : @xmath1057 ( here @xmath1058 is a delta function that is poincar dual to @xmath124 , and we use the linear form @xmath23 to identify the lie algebra @xmath29 with its dual ; this is also done in eqn .",
    "( [ zorkk ] ) below . ) the fact that the curvature is a delta function supported on @xmath124 means that the connection is flat away from @xmath124 and has a monodromy around @xmath124 . exponentiating the delta function in the curvature , this monodromy is @xmath1059 to understand this result , recall that @xmath1030 is a homogeneous space , and that the conjugacy class of @xmath1041 ( as an element of @xmath1060 ) is constant and depends only on @xmath125 .",
    "so eqn . ( [ zome ] ) really defines a conjugacy class in @xmath27 ; the monodromy around the knot must lie in this conjugacy class .",
    "we note that the conjugacy class in question depends only on the ratio @xmath1061 .",
    "let us make this more explicit for @xmath190 .",
    "take @xmath125 to be the @xmath12-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath8 .",

    "we have expressed the result in terms of a ratio of values of @xmath1337 because our normalization of @xmath1337 ( as a path integral rather than a ratio of path integrals ) is not the most common one in the mathematical literature . with the usual normalization ,",
    "the colored jones polynomial is of order 1 for @xmath703 and of order @xmath1332 at @xmath681 .",
    "second , in section [ sotwo ] we made a direct analysis of the stokes phenomena in passing through @xmath681 ( or more generally in crossing stokes lines that pass through @xmath681 ) .",

    "possible higher order terms in @xmath1056 are irrelevant in the sense of singularity theory and do not affect the estimate ( [ omsky ] ) of the critical behavior of the chern - simons path integral .",

    "<S> the title of this article refers to analytic continuation of three - dimensional chern - simons gauge theory away from integer values of the usual coupling parameter @xmath0 , to explore questions such as the volume conjecture , or analytic continuation of three - dimensional quantum gravity ( to the extent that it can be described by gauge theory ) from lorentzian to euclidean signature . </S>",
    "<S> such analytic continuation can be carried out by generalizing the usual integration cycle of the feynman path integral . </S>",
    "<S> morse theory or picard - lefschetz theory gives a natural framework for describing the appropriate integration cycles . </S>",
    "<S> an important part of the analysis involves flow equations that turn out to have a surprising four - dimensional symmetry . after developing a general framework </S>",
    "<S> , we describe some specific examples ( involving the trefoil and figure - eight knots in @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the space of possible integration cycles for chern - simons theory can be interpreted as the `` physical hilbert space '' of a twisted version of @xmath2 super yang - mills theory in four dimensions .    </S>",
