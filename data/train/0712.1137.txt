    "at the relatively low energies relevant for sn neutrinos , charged mu and tau leptons can not be produced so that mu- and tau - flavored neutrinos are not distinguishable in the sn or in detectors .",
    "( in the inner core of a sn the temperatures may be high enough to produce a significant thermal muon density , but this would not affect the emission from the neutrino sphere . ) the impact of the small second - order difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 refractive index does not produce observable effects as long as one only considers the traditional msw flavor conversion  @xcite .",
    "the picture changes if one includes the unavoidable effect of collective neutrino transformations in the region above the neutrino sphere . if the matter density is large enough that @xmath145 is comparable to or larger than @xmath148 , the survival probability of @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be completely modified and depends sensitively on the mixing angle @xmath38 . in future one",
    "should also include non - monochromatic energy spectra , leading to spectral split phenomena that could be more complicated than the previously studied two - flavor cases .",
    "one should also explore the impact of realistic angular distributions and of a non - zero dirac phase in the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "lower - mass progenitors may collapse with a o - ne - mg core and , on the computer , explode easily because there is very little mass in the envelope  @xcite . even at core",
    "bounce and immediately afterward , the density profile is so shallow that the ordinary h- and l - resonances may occur within the collective neutrino region  @xcite . in this case",
    "the effects discussed here are irrelevant because the mu - tau matter effect is negligible .",
    "probably our effects are also negligible during the cooling phase of an iron - core sn",
    ". however , flavor oscillation effects are probably largest during the accretion phase of an iron - core sn where the flavor dependence of the spectra and fluxes is more pronounced than during the cooling phase  @xcite .    when it is important , the mu - tau matter effect adds one more layer of complication to the already vexed problem of collective sn neutrino oscillations .",
    "it was previously recognized that `` ordinary '' collective oscillations are almost completely insensitive to the smallness of @xmath37 as long as it is not exactly zero .",
    "here we have found the opposite for the large mixing angle @xmath38 that is often assumed to be maximal .",
    "even small deviations from maximal 23-mixing can imprint themselves in the collective oscillation effect .",
    "both results are counter - intuitive and opposite to ordinary flavor oscillations .",
