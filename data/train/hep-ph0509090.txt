    "measuring the magnitude of the weak mixing matrix element @xmath8 is important for constraining the unitarity triangle and testing the standard model of weak interactions .",
    "the exclusive determination of @xmath1 requires knowledge of the relevant heavy - to - light meson form factor and in the past this has led to significant model dependence in the result .",
    "first , the methods that were used to calculate the form factor , such as light - cone sum rules , quark models and quenched lattice calculations , all have unknown systematic errors .",
    "second , each of these methods covers only part of the kinematic range ; to obtain the total decay rate , the results were extrapolated using simplified parameterizations for the momentum dependence of the form factor . in the past year",
    ", the situation has improved dramatically : there are now several measurements of partial @xmath9 branching fractions  @xcite and the first results for the form factor from precision lattice simulations with dynamical light quarks have been presented  @xcite . we show in this paper that if theoretical bounds on the form factor are taken into account , the experimental results for the partial branching fractions determine the shape of the form factor , to the point where no shape information at all is required from theory .",
    "this reduces the theoretical input for the determination of @xmath1 to a normalization of the relevant form factor , which can be taken at an energy within the range studied with current lattice simulations .",
    "for the first time , this allows an accurate , model independent , determination of @xmath1 from exclusive semileptonic decays .",
    "bounds on the form factor can be derived via the computation of an appropriately chosen correlation function in perturbative qcd . by unitarity and analyticity",
    ", the resulting `` dispersive bound '' constrains the behavior of the form factor in the semileptonic region  @xcite , and may be expressed as a condition on the coefficients in a convergent series expansion . while these bounded `` series parameterizations '' have been around for more than twenty - five years , many papers on the subject ( in particular all experimental papers ) have instead used simple pole forms to parameterize the form factor . in order to unify these descriptions , and to explain the dispersive bounds in a simple setting",
    ", we compare the class of series parameterizations emerging from the conventional dispersive bound analysis to the class of `` pole parameterizations '' introduced in @xcite .",
    "both representations are exact , in the sense that the true form factor is guaranteed to be described arbitrarily well by a member of the class , and dispersive bounds can be established for both classes by power counting in the heavy - quark mass . with the resulting constraints in place ,",
    "stable fits without truncation to a fixed number of parameters can be performed .",
    "in fact , for the series parameterization , we show that the bound given by simple heavy - quark power counting is orders of magnitude more stringent than the bound based on unitarity , thus providing much better control over the extraction of physical observables from the data .",
    "we also derive three new exact sum rules for the coefficients appearing in the series representation of the form factor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : params ] we review the pole and series parameterizations of the form factor .",
    "we list the experimental and lattice data to be used throughout the paper , and for later comparison we determine @xmath1 using three - parameter truncations of these parameterizations .",
    "section  [ sec : bounds ] then introduces the bounds associated with each parameterization , and establishes conservative estimates based on heavy - quark power counting for the bounded quantities .",
    "section  [ sec : shape ] examines the maximal precision for @xmath1 that can be reached with present data .",
    "we show that with a form factor determination at intermediate @xmath10 values , within the range studied in current lattice simulations , the experimental uncertainty on @xmath1 is well below 10% , whereas a form factor determination near maximal @xmath10 would not translate into a precise value of @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce three shape observables , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and discuss their sensitivity to the exact value of the bound . in section  [ sec : results ] , having established our procedure , we present final values for @xmath1 , and for @xmath14 , in terms of a single lattice data point , @xmath15 .",
    "we extract the shape observables , which are determined by the experimental semileptonic data alone , and show how these observables provide important constraints on the factorization approach to hadronic @xmath4 decays .",

    "the fit results from ( [ eq : pedestrian ] ) with @xmath18 and ( [ eq : trunc_series ] ) with @xmath19 are indistinguishable .",
    "note that the experimental data is binned : @xcite give the result in three bins , while @xcite gives the result in five @xmath10-bins .",
    "we plot the value and error divided by the bin width at the average @xmath10-value in each bin .",
    "for the three - bin results , we have slightly shifted the points to the left and right to increase visibility.[fig : data ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]    having restricted the shape of the @xmath10 spectrum , or equivalently , of the form factor , by experimental measurements , the central value and errors for @xmath1 are determined by varying the allowed form factor over all `` reasonable '' curves that are consistent with the data , and with a normalization of the form factor taken from theory at a given value ( or multiple values ) of @xmath10 . defining this procedure",
    "precisely requires specifying a class of curves that contains the true form factor ( to a precision compatible with the data ) , and that is sufficiently rich to describe all variations impacting the observables under study .",
    "a statistical analysis along standard lines then determines central values and errors for the desired observable quantities .",
    "a starting point to isolate such a class of curves is the dispersive representation of the relevant form factor : @xmath20 here @xmath13 is defined by the relative size of the contribution to @xmath14 from the @xmath21 pole , and @xmath22 . for massless leptons ,",
    "the semileptonic region is given by @xmath23 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) states that , after removing the contribution of the @xmath21 pole lying below threshold , @xmath24 is analytic outside of a cut in the complex @xmath10-plane extending along the real axis from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , corresponding to the production region for states with the appropriate quantum numbers .",
    "one class of parameterizations keeps the @xmath21 pole explicit and approximates the remaining dispersion integral in ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) by a number of effective poles : @xmath27 the true form factor can be approximated to any desired accuracy by introducing arbitrarily many , finely - spaced , effective poles . in the next section ,",
    "we derive a bound on the magnitudes , @xmath28 , of the coefficients of the effective poles .",
    "this allows a meaningful @xmath29 limit , thus enabling us to investigate the behavior of the fits when arbitrarily many parameters are included .",
    "we find in actuality that current data can not yet resolve more than one distinct effective pole in addition to the @xmath21 pole .",
    "parameterizations of the above type are widely used to fit form factors .",
    "in particular , a simplified version of the @xmath18 case , the so - called becirevic - kaidalov ( bk ) parameterization  @xcite is used in many recent lattice calculations and experimental studies . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "this two - parameter form is overly restrictive since it enforces scaling relations which at small @xmath10 are broken by hard gluon exchange .",
    "the size of these hard - scattering terms , which appear at leading order in the heavy - quark expansion , is subject to some controversy and constraining their size is an important task .",
    "the parameterization of the form factors should allow for their presence .",
    "another class of parameterizations is obtained by expanding the form factor in a series around some @xmath30 in the semileptonic region up to a fixed order , with the coefficients of this expansion as the fit parameters .",
    "the convergence of this simple expansion is very poor due to the presence of the nearby singularities at @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , an improved series expansion of the form factor that converges in the entire cut @xmath10-plane is obtained after a change of variables that maps this region onto the unit disc @xmath33 . in terms of the new variable",
    ", @xmath34 has an expansion @xmath35^k \\ , , \\quad z(q^2,t_0 ) = { \\sqrt{t_+ - q^2 } - \\sqrt{t_+-        t_0 } \\over \\sqrt{t_+ - q^2 } + \\sqrt{t_+ - t_0 } } \\,,\\ ] ] with real coefficients @xmath36 .",
    "the variable @xmath37 maps the interval @xmath38 onto the line segment @xmath39 , with the free parameter @xmath40 corresponding to the value of @xmath10 mapping onto @xmath41 .",
    "points immediately above ( below ) the @xmath10-cut are mapped onto the lower ( upper ) half - circle @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath43 accounts for the pole in @xmath24 at @xmath31 , while @xmath44 is any function analytic outside of the cut .",
    "it is interesting to note that this reorganization succeeds in turning a large recoil parameter , @xmath45 , into a small expansion parameter .",
    "for example , for @xmath46 the variable @xmath47 is negative throughout the semileptonic region and @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the velocities of the @xmath4 and @xmath51 mesons . the same size ,",
    "but for positive @xmath47 is obtained for @xmath52 . by choosing the intermediate value @xmath53 , the expansion parameter can be made as small as @xmath54 .",
    "a second class of parameterizations is obtained by a truncation of the above series : @xmath55^k \\,.\\ ] ] as discussed in the next section , it is conventional to take @xmath56 with this choice , a bound @xmath57 is obtained by perturbative methods .  ,",
    "the expansion parameters , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and expansion coefficients , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are related by the mbius transformation : @xmath62 it is easily verified that the sum of squares of coefficients is invariant under such a transformation , @xmath63 , as guaranteed by the construction of @xmath64 , see ( [ eq : bound ] ) . ] together with the restriction @xmath33 , this allows a meaningful @xmath65 limit .",
    "in actuality , we find that current data can only resolve the first three terms in the series ( [ eq : trunc_series ] ) .",
    "[ b]@xmath15 [ b]@xmath66    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in order to extract the most precise value of @xmath1 , it is important to make full use of the existing experimental data for @xmath0 that determines the form factor shape . to emphasize this point ,",
    "the analysis was done here using no shape information at all from theory , but only a normalization at one @xmath10-point .",
    "our results make it clear that the limiting factor in the determination of @xmath1 is currently the form factor normalization , with very small uncertainty associated with the form factor shape .",
    "similar conclusions are implicit in other recent works . for example , in @xcite the reduction in error compared to methods employing only total experimental branching fractions is due almost entirely to the inclusion of shape information from experiment , and not to the inclusion of additional theory input points . in @xcite , experimental data is combined with simple parameterizations of the form factor shape to constrain the hadronic input parameters appearing in sum rule estimates of the form factor .",
    "in contrast to these and other previous works , we have avoided any theoretical biases concerning the form factor shape .    in practical terms , the parameterizations ( [ eq : pedestrian ] ) , with @xmath18 , and ( [ eq : trunc_series ] ) , with @xmath19 , are sufficient for describing the current generation of semileptonic data , in the sense that the addition of more parameters does not significantly improve the fits .",
    "to provide rigorous error estimates it is necessary to allow for arbitrarily many additional parameters within the dispersive bounds ( [ eq : bound_rho ] ) and ( [ eq : bound ] ) .",
    "for `` global '' quantities like @xmath1 it is possible to show by imposing only the very loose bounds @xmath67 in ( [ eq : pedestrian ] ) , or @xmath68 in ( [ eq : trunc_series ] ) that the extracted values are actually insensitive to the addition of more parameters . with a single lattice input value @xmath69",
    ", we find @xmath70 the first error is experimental , the second is theoretical from the lattice input , and the third is due to the uncertainty in the form factor shape . for definiteness , the central values in ( [ eq : norm ] ) are obtained using the parameterization ( [ eq : trunc_series ] ) with @xmath71 , and the third error is very conservatively estimated by adding the maximum variation of the boundaries of the @xmath72 interval induced by relaxing the bound to @xmath73 .    for less global quantities , like the slope of the form factor at @xmath74 , the very loose bounds ( [ eq : bound_rho ] ) and ( [ eq : bound ] ) are not sufficient to tightly constrain the impact of arbitrarily many additional parameters .",
    "in this case we adopt more realistic estimates for the bounds , and find @xmath75 the first error is experimental , and the second is due to uncertainty in the form factor shape ( these quantities are independent of the form factor normalization ) .",
    "the central values in ( [ eq : shape ] ) are again obtained using the parameterization ( [ eq : trunc_series ] ) with @xmath71 , and the shape error is conservatively estimated by adding the maximum variation of the boundaries of the @xmath72 interval when the bound is relaxed to @xmath76 .",
    "while the conventional dispersive bound approach provides an elegant means of demonstrating formal convergence properties with the minimal assumption of form factor analyticity and the convergence of an operator product expansion , some caution is required in order to avoid misinterpreting the results .",
    "firstly , for certain observables , e.g. @xmath1 , the fits are much more tightly constrained by the data than by the unitarity - based dispersive bound .",
    "this leads to the happy conclusion that the errors on @xmath1 do not depend on the chosen parameterization or the exact value of the bound , and the analysis lends itself to a straightforward statistical interpretation . secondly",
    ", other important observables , such as the slope of the form factor , _ are _ sensitive to the addition of more parameters than can be constrained by the data , but are allowed by the unitarity bound . since this bound",
    "is overestimated , presumably by orders of magnitude , a reliance on this procedure would lead to the pessimistic conclusion that almost no information at all can be extracted from the data for these quantities . in such cases , we propose to use tighter bounds , which follow from the scaling behavior of the bounded quantity in the heavy quark limit .",
    "apart from establishing order - of - magnitude estimates for the bounds in ( [ eq : bound_rho ] ) and ( [ eq : bound ] ) by heavy - quark power counting , none of the above analysis relies on heavy - quark , large - recoil or chiral expansions , or on the associated heavy - quark , soft - collinear or chiral effective field theories .",
    "however , the semileptonic data can be used to test predictions from these effective field theories , and to determine low - energy parameters that can be used as inputs to the calculation of other processes .",
    "for example , using the experimental result @xmath77  @xcite together with @xmath78 from ( [ eq : shape ] ) , we find @xmath79 where the first error is experimental , and the second is due to the form factor shape uncertainty in ( [ eq : shape ] ) .",
    "such ratios provide a strong test of factorization  @xcite . the leading - order prediction for this ratio , corresponding to the `` naive '' factorization picture where hard - scattering corrections are neglected , yields @xmath80 .",
    "this uncertainty includes only the effects of varying the renormalization scale of the leading - order weak - interaction coefficients  @xcite between @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this may be compared to the prediction of beneke and neubert  @xcite who use qcd factorization theorems for two - body decays to work beyond leading order and include the effects of hard - scattering terms , obtaining for the same ratio , @xmath83 .",
    "the uncertainty in their prediction is dominated by the uncertainty in the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of the @xmath4- and @xmath51-mesons .",
    "bauer et al .",
    "@xcite evaluate the same factorization theorems using a different strategy : they use experimental results for other @xmath84 decays to determine the part involving the lcdas from data , which is possible if all power corrections , and perturbative corrections of order @xmath85 , are neglected . for the ratio ( [ eq : r ] ) they find @xmath86 , where we display only experimental errors .",
    "the semileptonic data provides important information on otherwise poorly constrained hadronic parameters entering these processes .    as a second application , the parameter @xmath87",
    "measuring the relative size of hard - scattering and soft - overlap contributions in the @xmath88 form factor can be related to the slope of the form factor at @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "extrapolated to zero recoil , the lattice calculations in @xcite give for the slope of the @xmath89 form factor , @xmath90^{-1 } = 1.2\\pm 0.1 $ ] .",
    "together with ( [ eq : shape ] ) this yields @xmath91 where the first error is experimental , the second is theoretical from the lattice determination of @xmath92 , and the third is due to the form factor shape uncertainty in ( [ eq : shape ] ) . establishing the relative size of the hard - scattering and soft - overlap contributions from the semileptonic data provides another important input to factorization analyses of hadronic @xmath4 decays .",
    "the above result for @xmath87 does not unambiguously establish @xmath93 which signals the presence of hard - scattering terms , but it disfavors the opposite scenario , @xmath94 , where the form factor is completely dominated by hard - scattering .",
    "more data will help reduce both the experimental and shape - uncertainty errors for this quantity .    as a third application ,",
    "the form factor @xmath14 and shape observable @xmath13 determine the coupling constant @xmath95 via @xmath96 where the first error is experimental , the second is theoretical from the lattice form factor normalization , and the final error is due to the form factor shape uncertainty , determined as in ( [ eq : shape ] ) .",
    "since the semileptonic data is concentrated at small @xmath10 , it is not very sensitive to the detailed structure of the sub - threshold pole and dispersive integral in ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) .",
    "in fact , the data do not yet definitively resolve a distinct contribution of the @xmath21 pole , although the opposite scenario  dominance by the @xmath21 pole in ( [ eq : dispersion ] )  is ruled out  @xcite .",
    "our implementation of the bounds in ( [ eq : bound_rho ] ) and ( [ eq : bound ] ) could be formalized in terms of standard methods of constrained curve fitting  @xcite . in this language , we have enforced a `` prior '' probability function which is constant if the parameters obey the bound on @xmath97 or @xmath98 , and zero otherwise . for simplicity , we then performed a @xmath99 fit , assuming sufficient statistics that the data is gaussian distributed .",
    "the resulting error estimates should be conservative .",
    "firstly , this prior allows equal probability for parameter values that are near the bound , even though we believe such values are increasingly unlikely .",
    "other prior functions may be considered  for example , in the case of the series parameterization ( [ eq : trunc_series ] ) , a gaussian prior on the variable @xmath100 , with mean and standard deviation of order unity .",
    "secondly , in estimating errors based on @xmath101 , we neglect the fact that bounds enforce restrictions that renormalize the probability distributions , and to the extent that the bounds are relevant , this tends to overestimate errors . as a simple example",
    ", if an absolute bound happened to coincide with the boundary of the `` @xmath72 '' interval obtained for an observable based on @xmath102 , we would estimate that the observable was within the interval with only @xmath103 confidence , whereas the bounds guarantee this with @xmath104 confidence . in a more refined analysis , a direct evaluation of the statistical integrals could account for such boundary effects .",
    "an alternative procedure employed in @xcite , and generalized in @xcite to include shape information from experiment , has a slightly more complicated statistical interpretation . here",
    "theory information on the form factor , combined with the dispersive bounds , is used to generate a statistical sample of `` envelopes '' , each consisting of the curves defined at each @xmath10-point by the minimum and maximum values that the form factor can take .",
    "( note that some curves may be ruled out by the bounds , yet allowed by the envelopes , which are generated by extremizing point - by - point in @xmath10 . )",
    "this sample of envelopes is then combined with experimental branching fractions to determine a distribution for @xmath1 or other observables .",
    "working in terms of parameters @xmath36 allows the experimental and lattice data to be treated on the same footing , and yields a more straightforward interpretation of the constraints enforced by the bounds .",
    "fortunately , these complications play an extremely minor role in the case of @xmath1 . as illustrated by figure",
    "[ fig : data ] , the errors are very nearly gaussian , and nearly identical results are obtained using different parameterizations , and widely different values for the bounds .",
    "a more refined statistical analysis might be useful for those shape observables that show sensitivity to the bounds , to extract as much information as possible from the experimental data .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the form factor shape information necessary for a precise extraction of @xmath1 is now entirely determined from experiment . rather than relying on theoretical models for this shape , the current and future experimental data can instead be used as a precision tool for testing theory predictions and determining hadronic parameters in other processes .",
    "for example , the ratio in ( [ eq : r ] ) should be predicted with good accuracy from the factorization approach to hadronic @xmath4 decays , and can be even more firmly established once the hard - scattering contribution in ( [ eq : delta ] ) is determined more precisely from data .",
    "the methodology employed here in @xmath4 decays can be validated in the analogous situation of semileptonic @xmath105 decays , where experiment and lattice cover the entire range of @xmath10 .",
    "note that we only used lattice input for the form factor at a single @xmath10-value , to avoid theoretical biases on the form factor shape , and to emphasize the conclusion that the shape is determined by experiment ; however , studying the form factor shape provides an important test of lattice calculations .",
    "our results show that with improved lattice data , an exclusive measurement of @xmath1 that rivals or even surpasses the inclusive determination is possible .",
