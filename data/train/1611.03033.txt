    "this paper is motivated by the following continuous problem : let @xmath16 be a compact set with smooth boundary and consider an eigenfunction of the laplacian @xmath17 with dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath18 .",
    "a natural question ( also for more general elliptic equations ) is whether it is possible to specify in advance and using only the geometry of @xmath19 where the maximum is located .",
    "a recent result of the second and third author @xcite shows the sharp result that the location of the maximum is at least @xmath20 away from the boundary when the domain @xmath19 is simply connected . here",
    "@xmath21 is a universal constant , see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "if we consider neumann conditions on the boundary @xmath22 , then it follows from the hot spots conjecture of rauch @xcite that both maximum and minimum of the eigenfunction should be assumed on the boundary .",
    "this conjecture is known @xcite to fail in general but is widely believed to be true at least for convex domains .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to prove an optimal inequality for a related problem on graphs .",
    "we derive a certain type of guarantee that spectral clustering is well - behaved in the presence of clusters .",
    "furthermore , we prove a continuous version of our result wherein we show that the location of both maximum and minimum of the first nontrivial neumann eigenfunction for laplace s equation is not too close to the nodal line @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be a connected , directed , weighted graph with normalized edge weights @xmath2 @xmath25 we introduce a laplacian - type operator @xmath26 acting on functions @xmath27 as @xmath28 note that , at this level of generality , the operator @xmath26 need not be self - adjoint .",
    "this formulation is motivated by the mean - value property of the laplacian in the continuous setting , the negative sign ensures that the operator is positive definite .",
    "we additionally assume , to avoid nontrivial counterexamples , that a random walk ( with transition probabilities @xmath2 ) can ultimately travel from every vertex to every other vertex . there are naturally associated eigenvalues @xmath9 which satisfy @xmath29 it is easy to see ( using either the perron - frobenius theorem or the gershgorin circle theorem ) that @xmath30 .",
