    "@xcite introduced a deformed quantum mechanics based on modified commutation relation between position and momentum operators .",
    "these commutation relation lead to generalized heisenberg uncertainty principle ( gup ) which define non zero minimum length in position or minimal length .",
    "the concepts of gup and minimal length originate from several studies in string theory @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite and non - commutative field theories nekrasov .",
    "other similar constructions leading to the concept of gup have been also initiated by some authors @xcite .",
    "the fundamental outcome of the gup is the appearance of an uv / ir `` bootstrap '' .",

    "some scenarios have been proposed where the minimal length is related to large extra dimensions @xcite , to the running coupling constant @xcite and to the physics of black holes production @xcite .",
    "recently , a great interest has been devoted to studies of quantum systems in the presence of minimal lengths .",
    "the solution of schrodinger equation in momentum space for the harmonic oscillator in d - dimensions kempf1,kempf2,minic and the cosmological constant problem with minimal lengths have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the minimal length on the energy spectrum and momentum wave functions of the coulomb potential in one dimension and three dimensions has been studied respectively in @xcite and @xcite , the high temperature properties of the one dimensional dirac oscillator has been investigated by the author in @xcite , the solution of the three dimensional dirac oscillator using supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite and the casimir force for the electromagnetic field in the presence of the minimal length has been also computed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested by the effect of the minimal length on the electron magnetism confined by a harmonic potential in the regime of high temperatures .",
    "the electron magnetism under confining potential has been considered in the ordinary case in @xcite and recently in the context of canonical non - commutative quantum mechanics in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follow . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief review of quantum mechanics with generalized commutation relations and solve exactly the stationary schrodinger equation , in the momentum space representation , for a spinless electron under the action of a constant magnetic field and a isotropic harmonic oscillator . in section iii , the magnetic moment and susceptibility of the system are examined in the regime of high temperature .",
