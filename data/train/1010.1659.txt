    "the standard explanation for the appearance of strong magnetic fields at the solar surface involves the coherent rise of a tachocline - generated magnetic flux tube through the solar convection zone . flux tube emergence simulations do give very promising results @xcite , the paradigm looks elegant and is very textbook friendly , but some of its assumptions are problematic : the integrity of flux tubes , their rise , and even their very existence .",
    "so far , numerical simulations have failed to produce the assumed thin magnetic flux tubes in the tachocline @xcite .",
    "magnetic buoyancy as the driving transport mechanism through the convection zone can be dominated by downward pumping @xcite . for the tubes to remain intact , strongly super - equipartition field strengths and strong twists",
    "are required @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems not unreasonable to explore alternative mechanisms of formation of strong magnetic fields at the solar surface .",
    "a number of positive arguments has been put forward @xcite in favour of formation of sunspots from local flux concentrations near the surface . in mean - field models ,",
    "such magnetic instabilities have been produced by introducing a magnetic dependence of the thermal eddy diffusivity @xcite and the viscous stress tensor @xcite .",
    "turbulence generally is associated with enhanced transport effects .",
    "however , it also exhibits non - diffusive behaviour , generating magnetic field on much larger scales than the driving scale .",
    "an example is turbulent dynamos that are able to produce large - scale magnetic fields @xcite . in a stratified layer ,",
    "magnetic fields tend to become buoyantly unstable : assuming a constant temperature across the magnetic flux tube , pressure balance implies lower densities in regions of stronger magnetic field .",
    "now one can wonder what the role of turbulent pressure is in such an equilibrium if the magnetic structures extend over several turbulent eddies .",
    "the turbulent pressure associated with the convective fluid motions is certainly not negligible and is strongly affected by the background magnetic field .",
    "the latter can be seen by evaluating the total turbulent dynamic pressure , here given for the isotropic case : @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the velocity and magnetic fluctuations , respectively , @xmath3 the vacuum permeability and @xmath4 the fluid density .",
    "overbars indicate ensemble averaging . as shown in direct numerical simulations (",
    "* hereafter referred to as bkr ) , in forced turbulence with imposed uniform large - scale magnetic field , the total turbulent energy is approximately conserved in this parameter regime . @xmath5 as a result , one finds a reversed feedback from the magnetic fluctuations on the turbulent pressure : @xmath6 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred to as rk07 ) .",
    "one can see that the effective mean magnetic pressure force is reduced and can , in a certain parameter range , be reversed .",
    "this effect would then counteract the aforementioned buoyancy instability in the presence of turbulence .",
    "rk07 have suggested that the reversed feedback instability could lead to the formation of magnetic flux concentrations near the solar surface .",
    "mean - field magnetohydromagnetic simulations by bkr confirmed the basic phenomenon of magnetic flux concentration by the effect of turbulence on the mean lorentz force and for sufficient stratification , a linear instability was found .",
    "direct numerical simulations ( dns ) by bkr confirmed the reversed feedback phenomenology , but did not address the effect of stratification .",
    "this is one of the important additions of the more recent work of @xcite , of which we report here the main highlights .",
    "dns of forced turbulence were performed in a cubic computational domain of size @xmath7 . for an isothermal equation of state and a constant vertical gravitational acceleration @xmath8",
    ", one finds an exponentially stratified density : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the constant density scale height , @xmath11 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath12 a normalisation factor .",
    "we choose @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , the smallest wavenumber .",
    "the density contrast then corresponds to @xmath15 .",
    "we solve the equations of compressible magneto - hydrodynamics in the form @xmath16",
    "@xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are kinematic viscosity and magnetic diffusivity , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 is the magnetic field consisting of a uniform mean field , @xmath22 , and a nonuniform part that is represented in terms of the magnetic vector potential @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the current density , and @xmath25 is the traceless rate of strain tensor , where commas denote partial differentiation . the turbulence is driven with a forcing function @xmath26 that consists of random plane non - polarized waves with an average wavenumber @xmath27 .",
    "the forcing strength is arranged such that the turbulent rms velocity , @xmath28 , is around @xmath29 .",
    "this value is small enough so that compressibility effects are weak .    in order to characterize our simulations",
    ", a set of dimensionless parameters is defined .",
    "the reynolds number is given by @xmath30 and is of the order 120 in the simulations .",
    "the magnetic prandtl number is @xmath31 , although in reality this parameter is much smaller than unity ; we choose here @xmath32 in order to achieve higher values for the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "the equipartition field strength @xmath33 is defined as a function of @xmath34 and the imposed fields are normalised against @xmath35 , the equipartition strength in the middle of the domain : @xmath36    the boundary conditions are stress - free perfect conductors at the top and bottom of the domain , periodicity in the horizontal direction .",
    "the simulations are performed with the pencil code , which uses sixth - order explicit finite differences in space and a third - order accurate time stepping method @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the mean momentum density by the fluctuations is @xmath37 where the overbars now indicate horizontal averages .",
    "the influence of the mean magnetic field can be found by subtracting the contributions that are present in the absence of a uniform background magnetic field and can be modelled by the following ansatz ( rk07 ) @xmath38 which will then appear in the effective mean lorentz force @xmath39 thus the total effective magnetic pressure of the mean field is given by @xmath40 as @xmath41 , and assuming no small - scale dynamo , we can determine @xmath42 from    @xmath43",
