    ", @xcite the presence of a tail below the peak should be due to usual interband transitions , in our approach the peak in the conductivity corresponds to the gap in the quasi - particle spectrum and is well above a real subgap tail determined by lattice fluctuations .    in the inset of fig.5 we report the ratio ( solid line ) between @xmath168 , the spectral weight of the conductivity calculated in this section , and @xmath121 , the same quantity in the limit of infinite frequency .",
    "this ratio is compared with that ( dashed line ) obtained by means of exact diagonalizations of the hamiltonian for a system of six sites .",
    "@xcite our approach captures the correct onset of the optical response , even if it presents sharper features .",
    "this could be due to the fact that we are not considering a small cluster but we are performing the thermodynamic limit , and , furthermore , that higher order self - energy insertions should be included in order to improve the approach .",
    "the optical response shows similar features at lower values of the adiabaticity ratio @xmath119 . in the regime of",

    "we have discussed the optical properties of the half - filled spinless holstein model in the @xmath1 case at zero temperature within the @xmath5 approach . we have observed that , with increasing the @xmath2 coupling , the ordered phase affects the conductivity spectra inducing a transfer of spectral weight from low to high energies and a broadening of the optical interband gap .",

    "<S> actually this approach is able to introduce lattice fluctuations on the mean - field peierls solution since it takes into account the nonadiabatic polaron formation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , due to the polaronic effect , the lattice deformation is allowed to follow instantaneously the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated conductivity spectra are characterized by a transfer of spectral weight from low to high energies and by a broadening of the optical interband gap , with increasing the @xmath2 coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the quantum lattice fluctuations is able to determine in the infrared conductivity a subgap absorption term near the phonon energy and a wide band above the gap energy . </S>",
    "<S> the first contribution is due to the multi - phonon emission by the charge carriers , the second to the interband transitions accompanied by the multi - phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of lattice fluctuation effects beyond the @xmath5 approach is able to smooth the inverse square - root singularity of the @xmath5 and mean - field conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover these effects strengthen the features of the conductivity below and above the gap already found in the @xmath5 approach inducing an actual subgap tail . </S>",
    "<S> therefore lattice fluctuations influence the optical absorption at the low - energy subgap , at the gap and at the high - energy scale above the interband optical gap term . </S>",
    "<S> these features are found in the measured spectra.@xcite    in section i the model and the @xmath5 variational approach are briefly reviewed ; in section ii the spectral properties are deduced in order to characterize the quasi - particle gap of the @xmath0 phase ; in section iii the infrared spectra obtained within the @xmath5 approach are discussed ; finally in section iv the effects of lattice fluctuations beyond the @xmath5 approach are analyzed . </S>"
