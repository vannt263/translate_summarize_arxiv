    "we demonstrate how intrinsic dynamics of psuedoperiodic data can be extracted using _ laplacian eigenmaps _",
    "@xcite , a nonlinear dimension reduction method based on _ spectral graph theory_. we illustrate with the @xmath0-component of the chaotic rssler system . motivated by the fact that such data usually exhibit a highly redundant patterns in the form of repeated cycles , we first partition the time series into individual cycles @xmath1 s ( @xmath2 ) by local minimums as shown in fig .",
    "[ ts ] ( a ) .",
    "each cycle is then mapped to a high dimensional vector @xmath3 whose dimension equals the number of points in that cycle . our goal is to compute a set of new , low - dimensional ( in the simplest case , @xmath4 ) representation , or embedding @xmath5 s , such that the proximity relations among @xmath3 s are maximally preserved in their low - dimensional counterparts @xmath5 s and that the redundancy in the cycles are removed .",
    "-component of the chaotic rssler system , which is divided into cycles by local minima ( circles ) .",
    "( b ) laplacian embedding @xmath6 extracted on the cycle scale for the time series shown in ( a ) , and ( c ) the return plots of @xmath6 derived by two dimension reduction methods , i.e. , the laplacian eigenmaps and multidimentional scaling.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    to achieve this , a weighted graph @xmath7 is constructed , where each node corresponds to a cycle @xmath3 and edges are assigned between all pairs of nodes .",
    "the graph can either be fully connected or only bind those vertices within the @xmath8-nearest - neighbors and we aims at extracting the dynamics from the topology of the graph .",
    "we use @xmath9 to denote the similarity between cycle @xmath3 and @xmath10 , which can be chosen conveniently as the correlation coefficient @xmath11 ( in case @xmath3 and @xmath10 differ in length , shift the shorter vector on the longer one until @xmath12 maximizes ) .",
    "then , the low - dimensional representation @xmath5 s can be cast as the solution of the following optimization problem , @xmath13 , which penalizes those mappings where nearby points @xmath3 s are relocated far apart in the space of @xmath5 s . in case of univariate @xmath5 s ,",
    "the objective can be written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15^{\\top}$ ] , @xmath16 is the _ graph laplacian _ , and @xmath17 is the diagonal degree matrix such that @xmath18 . hence the name _ laplacian eiganmap_. to prevent arbitrary scaling in the solution , one can enforce the constraint @xmath19 .    , which is obtained by collecting the local minima @xmath20 , and ( b ) the extracted @xmath6 . the rssler system here is corrupted by @xmath21 dynamical noise and @xmath22 measurement noise .",
    "it is obvious that the return plots from @xmath6 takes on a clearer form of quadratic function , indicating that the original nonlinear dynamics is sufficiently kept.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the above constrained minimization is solved by the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath23 , where @xmath24 s ( @xmath25 ) are eigenvalues sorted in an ascending order , and @xmath26 s are the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "it can be shown that the minimum eigenvalue @xmath27 is zero , corresponding to an eigenvector ( @xmath28 ) of all 1 s .",
    "therefore it is degenerate and the optimal solution is actually provided by @xmath29 , the eigenvector of the second smallest eigenvalue @xcite . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ ts ] , the eigenvector @xmath30 provides a unique , reduced representation of the original time series by capturing the dynamics of the oscillatory data on the cycle scale .",
    "we use a general notation @xmath6 ( @xmath31 for cycle ) for such reduced series representation ( i.e. , other dimension reduction schemes can also be applied , and we denote the reduced series all as c(i ) ) . more generally , to obtain an @xmath32-dimensional solution for @xmath5 s , one can simply extract the @xmath32 trailing eigenvectors @xmath33 s ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the comparison between laplacian embedding @xmath6 and the poincare section points @xmath35 ( obtained by collecting the local minima ) indicates that they are dynamically identical by sharing the same chaotic invariants , i.e. , lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension .",
    "however , in case of significant noise ( see fig .",
    "[ noise1 ] ) , our approach can capture more of the deterministic structure than does @xmath35 and is therefore more robust .",
    "this is not surprising , since acquisition of @xmath6 is based on an optimization process that preserves the proximity relation between all pairs of cycles simultaneously , while @xmath35 is obtained by treating each cycle independent of each other .",
    "it is reasonable to expect the former to excavate more useful , global patterns than the latter .",
    "many other forms of dimension reduction can also be applied here , which produce similar results .",
    "for example , the _",
    "multidimensional scaling _ method that preserves the pairwise distance yields almost the same outputs as the _ laplacian eigenmaps _ , see fig .",
    "[ ts](c ) .",
    "actually , the applicability of dimension reduction techniques in extracting the dynamics shall be generally justifiable , considering the intrinsically low correlation dimensions of most real world pseudoperiodic data .",
    "the corresponding trajectories in phase space tend to have similar orientations for nearby cycles ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ gait ] ) .",
    "such redundancy can be effectively removed through dimension reduction , leaving only the useful degrees of freedom for manifestation of the dynamics of interest .     and @xmath36 component revealed by ( a ) poincare section points @xmath35 and ( b ) the extracted @xmath6 . the rssler system is corrupted by @xmath21 dynamical noise and @xmath22 measurement noise . ,",
    "scaledwidth=30.0% ]    reconstructing the dynamics on the cycle scale not only enhances the robustness to noise , but bring new vitality to a number of nonlinear methods which are otherwise not suitable for oscillatory data due to the inherent periodicity , such as detrended fluctuation analysis , surrogate data method , recurrence plot , causality , entropy and so on .",
    "for example , the detrended fluctuation analysis , which computes the variance of the detrended data at different scales , will produce similar variance curves ( i.e. , uprising at small scale and saturate at the periodicity of the signal ) for all pseudoperiodic data despite their distinct dynamics .",
    "this is because the periodic trend dominating in the data will conceal the underlying , subtle dynamics . thus extracting the dynamics on the cycle scale proves to be crucial for subsequent analysis",
    "a topic which is of great interest to oscillatory data analysis in recent years is to detect the degree of synchronization between self - sustained oscillators .",
    "for example , the peakness of the phase difference distribution and the consistency of mutual nearest neighbors are used to characterize the phase synchrony @xcite and the dynamical interdependence @xcite , respectively .",
    "here we are especially interested in the case where the phase relation between two oscillator is evident , but is hard to estimate due to non - phase - coherence and noise , or is not sensitive to degree of changes of synchrony .",
    "for example , the blood pressure interacted with heartbeat , where each cycle of blood pressure variation correspond to one heartbeat . the phase index in this case may not be quite informative of the synchrony strength .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of noise in most real world data will inevitably degrade the dependency measures .    unlike traditional methods",
    ", we propose to quantify the synchrony the noisy , noncoherent pseudoperiodic data _ on their cycle scale _ through their laplacian embedding @xmath6 .",
    "we first test with the @xmath0 and @xmath36 components of the noisy rssler system .",
    "although these two components are non - separable and can not be strictly defined as being synchronized , they are actually `` in phase '' and therefore suitable in our context .",
    "the two time series are first segmented into cycles by the local maximums of one of the data ( i.e. , the _ _ i__th cycle in both time series share the same time span ) .",
    "we find that the poincare section points picked up from the two time series can hardly capture the interdependency due to noise , in that the scatter plot between the poincare section points of @xmath0 and @xmath36 leads to a group of random points ( fig .",
    "[ noise2 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "comparatively , the extracted laplacian embedding @xmath6 s extracted from @xmath0 and @xmath36 by our approach successfully reveal the synchrony pattern by demonstrating an uprising trend in the corresponding scatter plot ( fig .",
    "[ noise2 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "now we apply our approaches to human gait data collected from electrogoniometers at the knee and ankle joints that measure their sagittal plane kinematics during overground walking .",
    "human locomotion is a highly complex , rhythmic process that involves multilevel control of central nerve system and feedback from various peripheral sensors .",
    "here we consider two groups of subjects from healthy controls ( co ) and diabetic patients ( np , with significant peripheral neuropathy ) , each with 10 subjects @xcite .    , stride interval series , and the original ankle data , respectively .",
    "the frequency here is normalized by the sampling rate .",
    "the psds for the stride interval series and the original data show no significant difference between the healthy subject and the diabetic patient .",
    ", scaledwidth=30.0% ]    typically , the human gait time series ( fig .",
    "[ gait ] ( a ) and ( c ) ) exhibit a relatively fixed frequency with the stride interval demonstrating little variability , which is suited for dimension reduction .",
    "we first extract the dynamics of the ankle on its cycle scale by laplacian embedding .",
    "figure [ psd ] ( a)-(b ) display the power spectrum density ( psd ) of the extracted @xmath6 typically observed for the two groups .",
    "we find that most co subjects demonstrate broad band spectrums that scale as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , indicating the presence of long range correlation ( i.e. , the strides separated by a large time span are still statistically correlated ) . in comparison ,",
    "the spectrum of the diabetic patients are mostly flat resembling white noise processes ( @xmath39 ) , which means that the strides at different times are mostly uncorrelated .",
    "this difference , however , has not been found with either the stride interval ( si ) series ( fig .",
    "[ psd ] ( c)-(d ) ) or the raw data ( fig .",
    "[ psd ] ( e)-(f ) ) .",
    "this is because , the periodicity in the raw data can obscure the underlying fluctuations and that a linear fourier transform is not capable of characterizing nor distinguishing the nonlinear dynamics in the data ; on the other hand , although si removes the cyclic trend and has been widely used to quantify pathological locomotion @xcite , it loses much of the dynamical information by only recording the duration of cycles . in comparison ,",
    "the transform @xmath6 successfully removes the periodic trend while preserving the dynamical fluctuation within each cycle , in particular , the specific patterns of the four phases within a pace .",
    "therefore it keeps more valuable information about the neuromuscular control of human walking .",
    "the human walking involves the coordination of two major joints , i.e. , the knee and the ankle .",
    "so we are also interested in examining the synchrony between the knee and ankle data , which may provide further insights in understanding the neuralcontrol of walking .",
    "the knee and ankle movements during continuous walking are obviously in phase due to the physical connection of the two joints .",
    "the strength of coupling , however , can hardly be recognized from the phase due to the noncoherence @xcite ( see fig . [ gait ] ) .",
    "also , noise tends to destroy the local structure in phase space and thus hampers the dynamical dependency measures @xcite . to circumvent these difficulties , we compare the dynamics of the two time series by using their laplacian embedding @xmath6 s .",
    "note that each time series can be segmented by either its own local maximums , or those of its partner series ( markers in fig .",
    "[ gait ] ) . therefore we will segment each time series twice and compute the averaged correlation coefficients @xmath12 s between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "( ( a ) and ( b ) ) and stride interval series ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) , with the left and right columns for an healthy subject and a diabetic patient , respectively . as can be seen in ( b ) , the stride interval series can not distinguish the healthy from the diabetics , as the scatter plots of the stride interval series show similar uprising trends for both of them .",
    ", scaledwidth=30.0% ]    then we examine the interrelation between the laplacian embeddings from the ankle and the knee data . for healthy subjects ,",
    "the scatter plots demonstrate a significant uprising trend ( fig .",
    "[ y2xianguan ] ( a ) , @xmath42 ) , indicating that the knee and ankle movements are highly synchronized ; while for diabetics patients , the synchrony almost vanishes ( fig .",
    "[ y2xianguan ] ( b ) , @xmath43 ) .",
    "again , the discrimination between co and np groups is unavailable by stride interval series , which always exhibits a strong correlation between the joints ( fig .",
    "[ y2xianguan ] ( c)-(d ) ) , corresponding to high degree of phase synchronization .",
    "note that our approach avoids the difficulty of defining the phase . on the other hand ,",
    "it is superior to directly computing the correlation between pairs of equal - time cycles picked respectively from the two time series , which is sensitive to noise and nonstationarity . finally , we point out that a more comprehensive description of synchrony can be achieved by examining more laplacian eigenvectors . in the current case",
    "the single eigenvector @xmath29 already encodes the primary variability and is thus sufficient for the discriminative task .",
    "note that we have observed a lack of long range correlation in the ankle kinematics of the np group ( fig .",
    "[ psd ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this suggests the alteration of the locomotor pattern in the lower limbs , due to the nerve deterioration in feet and toes typical of the diabetics . despite the impaired peripheral feedback caused by the dying nerves , the _ knee _ kinematics of the np group are _ still _ found to demonstrate a stable long range correlation indistinguishable from the co group",
    "this  mismatch \" between the ankle / knee dynamics for diabetics can be reasonably explained by the weak synchrony between these two joints , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ y2xianguan ] ( b ) . from these findings",
    ", we can see that the impaired neuralfeedback from the feet influences only the lower limb locomotion while not that of the knees .",
    "we therefore conclude that the human walking is not critically dependent on the feedback from peripheral nervous system .",
    "it should be noted that although gates _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite checked the same data , they do not consider the interaction among the knee and angle locomotion which may be important in characterizing understanding neuralcontrol of human walking .",
    "furthermore the authors relied solely on the extracted stride interval series , which have been shown to contain limited dynamical information and therefore may be insufficient for the analysis and evaluation of the human walking .",
    "to conclude , we have for the first time circumvented the problem of rebuilding the complex dynamics in oscillatory data from the viewpoint of dimension reduction .",
    "we use a global optimization procedure to compute the inherent , low - dimensional representation that maximally preserves the topology of the cycles when embedded in the multi - dimensional euclidian space .",
    "our approach has been shown to be very robust to noise , and is capable of extracting the underlying dynamics and identifying the subtle synchrony pattern which usually degrade traditional linear or nonlinear methods .",
    "application to human gait data provides clinically promising information in discriminating the healthy from the neuropathological patients , and further enables us to make fundamental inference on the neuromuscular control mechanism of human walking .",
    "our approach may be of great relevance , and is expected to provide more accurate and powerful diagnostics , to the general biological and biomedical fields where complex oscillatory data abound .",
    "for example , we have applied the proposed method to the phonation data from the parkinson patients , and find a significant lack of long range correlation among the cycles in the signal compared to the healthy people .",
    "our approach can therefore serve as an alternative tool in early parkinson disease ( pd ) detection , where there are no blood or laboratory tests currently that can help in diagnosing pd .",
    "other potential applications which will be involved in the future works include the discrimination between parkinson and essential tremor , and the evaluation of the interaction between the blood pressure variation with the heart beat .",
