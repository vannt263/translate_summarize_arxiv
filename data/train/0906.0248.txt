    "the orientation of the magnetic field in the plane of the sky can be measured via the effects of aligned dust grains .",
    "the method of grain alignment has been a matter of debate for many years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "all methods predict that the grains align with their long axes perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "hence in the optical and near - infrared , where the polarization is caused by preferential extinction by aligned elongated grains of a background unpolarized source @xcite , the polarization orientation is parallel to the field . in the far - infrared and submillimetre , where the polarization is caused by preferential emission from aligned elongated dust grains @xcite ,",
    "the polarization orientation is perpendicular to the field orientation @xcite .",
    "the method of tracing the magnetic field using optical polarization of background starlight typically only works in regions of low extinction ( a@xmath2 @xmath1 15 ) .",
    "so this technique is mainly applicable towards the low - density edge regions of the clouds .",
    "this is because these data use preferential extinction of background starlight by aligned grains to produce the polarisation . at higher extinctions",
    "the background starlight tends to be completely extinguished and it is not possible to measure any polarization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "hence the submillimetre data can only trace the field orientation towards the high density central regions of the clouds .",
    "this is because these data use preferential emission from aligned dust grains to produce the polarisation , and are only sensitive to very high column densities in cloud centres .    at lower column densities ,",
    "submillimetre polarimeters do not currently have the sensitivity to detect polarized emission .",
    "furthermore , the nature of the usual data - taking method , using a chopping secondary mirror , ensures that any spatially extended components associated with the outer parts of the cloud are chopped away .",
    "consequently , a combination of these two methods , of optical and submillimetre polarimetry , in theory provides a way of tracing the magnetic field from the low extinction outer parts of molecular clouds , to the high extinction , compact , central , dense parts of clouds .",
    "it has previously been found @xcite that near - infrared polarisation mapping of background stars does not accurately trace the magnetic field in dense cloud regions .",
    "this is based on the observation that near - infrared polarisation levels , caused by preferential extinction by aligned grains , do not appear to rise sufficiently in denser cloud regions @xcite .",
    "this is not an effect of extinction preventing the infrared emission from escaping the cloud . instead",
    ", these authors concluded that the grains responsible for polarising background starlight are under - represented in dense cloud regions @xcite .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this : either there is a lack of aligned grains in dense regions ; or that only a small fraction of the dust grain size population in dense regions lies in the correct size range to polarise near - infrared emission from background stars .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to test the first of these hypotheses , whether or not there are significant numbers of aligned grains in high density regions .",
    "we do this by comparing submillimetre polarization measurements in high - density regions with optical polarization measurements in lower - density regions of the same cloud for a case in which both sets of measurements have been taken .",
    "the submillimetre data can not be affected by lower density foreground , or extended , field components , since they are not sensitive to these components .",
    "if the submillimetre and optical polarisations agree , then it would be difficult to avoid the conclusion that the magnetic field is continuous from low to high density and that the dust grains in the high - density regions are tracing the magnetic field in those regions .",
    "this would lead to the conclusion that there are significant numbers of aligned grains in the high - density regions .",

    "the mean column density is @xmath110@xmath20@xmath21 ( launhardt et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "this corresponds approximately to a@xmath2 @xmath1 10 ( frerking et al . , 1982 ) .",

    "table  [ cb3tab ] also lists the six optical magnetic field vectors which are closest to the submillimetre vectors  those optical vectors within an arcmin of the centre of the submillimetre emission .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the position angle of these six optical vectors is 77@xmath015 degrees .",
    "vector number 20 is seen to be significantly different from the other five vectors .",
    "this may be due to it being a foreground star .",

    "if we exclude this vector and calculate the mean of the remainder , we obtain a mean of 72@xmath04 degrees .",
    "therefore , we see that the field orientation as estimated from the submillimetre polarisation is in very good agreement with that estimated from the optical polarisation . consequently , we deduce that the magnetic field is continuous from the low to the high density regions , with a mean position angle of 71@xmath014 degrees .",
    "furthermore , the dust grains in the high density region appear to be tracing the magnetic field well .",
    "the submillimetre contours on figure  [ cb3fig ] show that this bok globule is elongated .",
    "the same elongation is seen in various molecular line tracers of this core , such as cs ( codella & bachiller 1999 ) .",

    "it is a starless core , possibly prestellar in nature @xcite .",
    "@xcite list this source as inactive , with neither a water maser nor molecular outflow . however , their detection of nh@xmath22 and c@xmath23s made them postulate that the source was more advanced than the other sources in their survey .",

    "the region of brightest submillimetre emission coincides with a blank area in the optical image , as expected for a dark dust cloud",
    ". nevertheless , background stars are visible through the edge of the cloud .",
    "no submillimetre polarimetry data were available for this cloud , but we can infer the plane - of - sky magnetic field orientation from the optical polarisation vectors .",
    "we note that the vectors to the east of the core centre have a systematically different mean position angle from those to the west .",
    "similarly the core long axis orientation also appears to shift from east to west .",
    "therefore , we compare the mean position angles of the magnetic field and core long axis separately in the eastern and western parts of the core . in the east ,",
    "the plane - of - sky magnetic field lies at a position angle of 60@xmath03 degrees .",
    "the long axis of the core in the east appears to lie along a position angle of roughly 122@xmath05 degrees .",
    "hence the short axis is at position angle 32@xmath05 degrees .",

    "the plane - of - sky magnetic field lies at a position angle of 94@xmath05 degrees .",
    "the long axis of the core in the west appears to lie along a position angle of roughly 157@xmath05 degrees .",
    "hence the short axis is at position angle 67@xmath05 degrees .",
    "the approximate angular offset between the magnetic field and the short axis of the globule is therefore 27@xmath010 degrees for the western half of the core .",
    "the weighted mean of these two offsets is therefore 28 degrees .",
    "the mathematical error - bar on this value is less than 10 degrees .",
    "however , given that the core and field both curve by more than 30 degrees we do not claim an error - bar of less than 20 degrees for this estimate , as this is the error - bar obtained if one treats the whole core simultaneously .",
    "a detailed submillimetre polarisation map of cb246 could potentially confirm that the curvature of the field exactly mirrors the curvature of the core throughout its length . in that case a smaller error - bar could be ascribed to the offset value .",

    "in addition , these data allow us to comment on the influence of magnetic fields on the star formation process .",
    "magnetically - dominated models of star formation predict that a cloud should collapse first along the magnetic field lines , and then subsequently contract quasi - statically perpendicular to the field orientation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
