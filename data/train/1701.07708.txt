    "jem - euso  @xcite is the concept of a space - borne fluorescence telescope to be hosted on the international space station ( iss ) .",
    "one of its main goals is a high statistical observation of eecrs with primary particle energies above 5@xmath0 .",
    "the telescope consists of three fresnel lenses and a focal surface consisting of 0.3 m pixels of uv sensitive detectors with a fast readout system , which enables a single photon counting measurement with a wide fov of @xmath1 with a spatial resolution of @xmath2 @xmath3 on the ground , covering roughly 60 @xmath4 of the entire surface of the earth in its flight on the iss orbit .",
    "looking towards the earth from space , jem - euso will reveal these particles as well as very high energy neutrinos by observing the fluorescence signal from the generated extensive air showers ( eas ) during their passage through the atmosphere .",
    "it will also contribute to the investigation of atmospheric phenomena such as transient luminous events ( tles ) and meteors .",
    "+ the jem - euso project is carried out by an international collaboration consisting of currently 88 institutions from 16 countries . in parallel to the jem - euso development , several pathfinders such as euso - balloon  @xcite , launched in august 2014 , and a ground - based pathfinder ta - euso  @xcite , currently in operation at the black rock mesa in utah , us have been developed .",
    "also , a space - borne pathfinder mini - euso as well as an advanced balloon - borne pathfinder with nasa super pressure balloon , euso - spb , are currently being developed to be launched in 2017 .",
    "+ the iss is flying at a speed of 7.5 km / s , which makes 15.5 orbits per day , and every 30 to 45 minutes it passes by the night region . while the iss flies on the orbit , it passes by many kinds of sceneries such as oceans , clouds , city light , airglows , forests , lightning , and so on from the altitude of 400 km .",
    "[ ebresult ]        [ eusoflt ]    the fig .",
    "[ ebresult ] shows the uv intensity measured during the five hours of an euso - balloon flight in august 2014 .",
    "the balloon was flying from left to right , from timmins airport to the dark region where mostly lakes and forests are located .",
    "the plot shows the averaged intensity in reference area in logarithmic scale as a function of time ( utc ) .",
    "the high intensities at the beginning of the flight ( left part in the plot ) appeared when the balloon was flying above cities like timmins and neighbourhoods , mines and airports , where there are full of artificial lights .",
    "one may see the uv background level is increasing by a factor of 10 comparing to other areas mainly covered by forests and lakes .",
    "jem - euso focal surface is consisting of hamamatsu 64-ch multi - anode photomultiplier tubes ( mapmts ) .",
    "one elementary cell unit ( ec_unit ) consists of 4 pmts , and 9 ec_units form a photo - detector module ( pdm ) . in total , the entire focal surface consists of 137 pdms with about 5,000 pmts with 0.3 m pixels .",
    "the output of pmts are readout by an elementary cell asic board ( ec_asic ) which consists of 6 spaciroc asics  @xcite .",
    "a pdm board is an interface board between a pdm and the latter part of data processing system , which sends slow control commands and processes first level triggers ( flts ) .",
    "jem - euso will have to deal with a huge amount of data .",
    "therefore , it is essential to develop an efficient flt which detects uhecrs in a continuously varying background . the fig .",
    "[ eusoflt ] shows a conceptual figure of euso flt ( top ) with an example of an euso - balloon laser event  @xcite ( bottom ) ; i.e. , an integrated image during 320 @xmath5s ( left ) and 3@xmath63 pixel counts as a function of frame ( gate time unit , gtu=2.5@xmath5s , right ) .",
    "the flt is a persistence trigger which scans counts in every 3@xmath63 pixel - boxes in a pmt , checking the excess against the pixel threshold which is automatically adjusted in every 320 @xmath5s .",
    "flt sets a proper threshold automatically as indicated by the blue dotted line in the plot to avoid triggering on the background , but only on the eas - like signals .",
    "[ vasca ]        [ 9minimages ]        [ fltoffline ]",
    "to test our electronics , as well as study and develop the flt in such a dynamic condition , we got an idea to use a big rotation tank of turlab  @xcite , which is located in the fourth basement of the physics department building of university of turin .",
    "+ turlab is a laboratory for geo - fluid - dynamics studies , where rotation is a key parameter such as coriolis force and rossby number . with using inks or particles , based on the fluid - dynamics , key phenomena such as planetary atmospheric and fluid instabilities can be reproduced in the turlab water tank .",
    "the tank has 5 m diameter with a capability of the rotation at a speed of 3 s to 20 min per rotation .",
    "also , as it is located in a very dark environment , the light intensity can be controlled artificially .",
    "by means of the rotating tank with the capabilities mentioned above , we have been testing euso electronics such as its basic performance as well as the flt for cosmic rays in the various background and sceneries which are transiting from one to another .",
    "+ when we set an euso ec_unit camera , a 2@xmath62 array of 64-ch mapmts on the ceiling at the height of 2 meters above the turlab tank , we know that a pixel watches a fov of 5@xmath7 @xmath8 from the past measurements .",
    "this fov corresponds to a solid angle of 6.25@xmath9 which is comparable to the one for jem - euso .",
    "therefore , considering the altitude and the speed of iss , we learned that we can reproduce the jem - euso observation in turlab .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ vasca ] shows the turlab tank , light sources and materials used to mimic the various kinds of phenomena and albedos that jem - euso will encounter .",
    "we use an euso ec_unit with a lens as a camera , readout by the euso front - end electronics with a test board , observing several materials such as meteor , cosmic ray , cloud , ground glass , passing from one to another in the fov in a constant background light produced by a high power led lamp diffused on the ceiling .",
    "high voltages , dc power supplies , function generators and monitoring oscilloscopes are on the desk by the side of the tank with a pc with labview interface for the test board to send commands for slow control and data acquisition , and root programs for monitoring and analysis . fig .",
    "[ 9minimages ] shows the examples of uv images obtained by the ec_unit camera during the full tank rotation .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fltoffline ] shows the result of uv intensities in a full rotation of the tank with various materials .",
    "the plot shows the summed counts of a pmt ( @xmath1064 pixels ) as a function of time in a unit of frame .",
    "afterward , we analysed the data and processed the flt offline .",
    "the middle panel shows the averaged counts per pixel which is used to set the flt threshold , while the bottom shows when flts were issued based on signals in that pmt , as a function of frame ( gtu ) respectively .",
    "almost all triggers coincide with passing over the arduino driven led chain , which mimics cosmic - ray like events , as it should be ; the one that is not is due to a specific location near one of the two bridges crossing the tank where the variations of light reflection were still too fast to be compensated by the slower rotation of the tank .",
    "jem - euso and its pathfinders will observe various cosmic / atmospheric phenomena in uv from the space / atmosphere .",
    "turlab is a unique facility in turin with interdisciplinary experts ( waves , geophysics , atmospheric science , meteors , astroparticle / cosmic ray physics , etc . ) , capable of providing an ideal condition to test euso electronics in a controlled environment against various sceneries which the telescope will encounter .",
    "the turlab system has been used to verify / implement flt in use of euso - spb .",
    "analysis and development of flt for mini - euso are currently ongoing .",
