    "we use the phrase _ strictly convex _ for functions whose hessian is positive definite , and for domains for which all principal curvatures of the boundary are positive .",

    "moreover , @xmath11 converges smoothly to a translating solution , i.e. , to a solution with constant time derivative .",
    "we remark that the parabolic maximum principle implies that the asymptotic solutions for different initial data @xmath0 are unique up to a constant . for the gau curvature flow , mentioned in the beginning",

    "such a generalization of a neumann boundary condition is studied for the elliptic case in @xcite .",
    "we base the barrier construction in the proof of theorem [ main thm ] on solutions to a related elliptic problem given by the following    [ ell thm ] consider @xmath8 , @xmath4 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 as introduced before .",
    "there exist a unique @xmath23 and a strictly convex function @xmath24 solving the boundary value problem @xmath25 provided that there exists a smooth strictly convex function @xmath0 satisfying the boundary condition @xmath26 .",
    "the function @xmath27 is unique up to a constant .",
    "we remark that translating solutions to ( [ flow eqn ] ) can be viewed as solutions to ( [ ell cor eqn ] ) , where @xmath28 denotes the speed .    a situation similar to theorem [ main thm ] is considered for the mean curvature flow in @xcite .",
    "hypersurfaces of prescribed gau curvature subject to neumann boundary conditions are found in the pioneering paper @xcite .",
    "the extension to the oblique boundary value problem is made in @xcite .",
    "flows of monge - ampre type for the neumann and the second boundary value problem are studied in @xcite . in our setting , the situation is more degenerate as neither @xmath10 nor @xmath9 do depend on @xmath27 .",
    "thus , both @xmath10 and @xmath9 fail to satisfy the crucial monotonicity requirement with respect to @xmath27 . for the second boundary value problem , translating solutions to flows of gau curvature type",
    "are considered in @xcite .    as mentioned in @xcite",
    ", methods of @xcite can be adapted to the non - parametric logarithmic gau curvature flow subject to the second boundary condition .",
    "for the neumann boundary value problem , however , the lack of monotonicity requires a new proof to uniformly bound the oscillation of a solution .",
    "therefore , we establish a generalization of the spatial @xmath20-estimates of @xcite . then , we use the translating solutions provided by theorem [ ell thm ] , in particular its uniquely determined speed , to construct an auxiliary barrier function and to obtain uniform spatial @xmath29-estimates . hence , the results of krylov , safonov , evans and schauder imply uniform bounds on higher derivatives for all times , uniformly bounded away from @xmath30 .",
    "this allows to show smooth convergence to a translating solution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "as explained in @xcite , standard linear parabolic theory and the implicit function theorem imply short - time existence .",
    "we show uniform first - order estimates in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "section 4 contains the proof of theorem [ ell thm ] . having the unique velocity of a translating solution",
    ", we can prove uniform a priori @xmath29-estimates in section 5 . finally , in section 6 , we prove smooth convergence to a translating solution . in appendix a we apply theorem [ ell thm ] to construct entire graphs of prescribed gau curvature .",
    "to illustrate the convergence of the flow , we carry out a numerical integration on a planar domain in appendix b.    we wish to thank jrgen jost , stefan mller and the max planck institute for mathematics in the sciences for their hospitality .",

    "for a vector @xmath33 we define @xmath34 . for the logarithm of @xmath10 we use @xmath35 .",

    "if the oscillation of @xmath335 tends to @xmath336 as @xmath337 , we consider for @xmath338 @xmath339 we have uniform estimates in any @xmath123-norm for the derivatives of @xmath340 , and locally ( in time ) uniform bounds for the @xmath55-norm , see ( [ encl ] ) .",
    "hence , a subsequence of the functions @xmath340 converges locally ( in time ) uniformly in any @xmath123-norm to a solution @xmath341 of our flow equation ( [ flow eqn ] ) that exists for all time .",
    "as the oscillation of @xmath342 is monotone in @xmath196 , we see that the oscillation of @xmath343 is equal to @xmath344 , independent of @xmath196 .",

    "it is a direct consequence of the strong maximum principle that there can not exist an entire strictly convex translating solution for any constant value of the gau curvature . in the rotationally symmetric case",

    "furthermore , the uniqueness of the solution implies its rotational symmetry .",
    "the solution can also be found by imposing a second boundary value condition .    from the strict convexity",
    ", we deduce that @xmath356 is a diffeomorphism from @xmath357 onto @xmath358 . integrating @xmath359",

    "nonexistence for @xmath367 : we argue similarly as in the afore mentioned case of constant gau curvature .",

    ", we know that @xmath374 , hence , @xmath150 solves equation ( [ gauss eqn ] ) in @xmath357 .",
    "furthermore , the neumann boundary condition and our choice of @xmath364 yield @xmath375 in a neighborhood of @xmath376 .",
    "thus , there is a translate @xmath377 , @xmath378 , which is strictly greater than @xmath27 .",

    "note that for fixed @xmath97 , the speed @xmath152 and the normal derivative at the boundary , @xmath388 , are uniquely related .",

    "in addition , @xmath365 for @xmath366 and @xmath405 for @xmath406 . as in part 2 of the proof of theorem [ riem thm ] , we can find for any @xmath88 a unique @xmath407 satisfying @xmath384 .",
    "since @xmath408 , we can choose a smooth function @xmath409 , defined on @xmath394 , such that @xmath410 for all @xmath411 .",
    "again , theorem [ ell thm ] gives a unique smooth convex rotationally symmetric solution @xmath385 to @xmath386 with @xmath412 replaced by @xmath413 , which is defined on @xmath387 and satisfies @xmath350 .",
    "we remark that the convexity of @xmath27 implies that @xmath414 on @xmath387 .",
    "thus , @xmath27 also solves the elliptic equation , if we replace @xmath413 by the original @xmath412 .",
