    "two previous papers have given the results of a study of reverse - electron flow in isolated neutron stars with positive polar - cap corotational charge density @xmath1 , in which free emission of ions maintains the boundary condition for space - charge limited flow .",
    "the sign of this quantity depends on the relation between rotation spin @xmath2 and polar magnetic flux density @xmath3 .",
    "we refer to goldreich & julian ( 1969 ) for its euclidean - space definition , and to muslimov & tsygan ( 1992 ) and muslimov & harding ( 1997 ) for the general - relativistic modification used here .",
    "most publications have assumed the parallel case , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and electron acceleration .",
    "but there does not appear to be any reason why the antiparallel case with @xmath6 and ion and positron acceleration should not be present in the neutron - star population .",
    "the two earlier papers ( jones 2010a , 2011 ; hereafter papers i and ii ) considered in some detail the consequences of proton formation in the electron - positron showers produced by the reverse - electron flux at the polar cap and its relation with observed radio - pulsar phenomena . but an important omission was the effect of reverse - electron flow on the electrostatics of particle acceleration under the space - charge limited boundary condition , and this is the subject of the present paper .    in this paper ,",
    "the subscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 are with reference to the local magnetic field direction . under the surface electric - field boundary condition @xmath9 assumed in the classic paper of ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) , reverse - electron flow does not modify ion or positron acceleration in any important way because the surface value of the acceleration field @xmath10 is unconstrained",
    ". however , the presence of a reverse - electron negative charge density under the surface boundary condition @xmath11 of space - charge limited flow can , in certain cases , reduce the acceleration field to values so low that there is no possibility of electron - positron pair creation within the open magnetosphere above the polar cap or of a slot - gap x - ray source .",
    "photo - electric absorption of polar - cap and neutron - star surface blackbody photons by accelerated ions is the source of the reverse - electron flux and the process is analogous with electron - positron pair creation in its effect on the acceleration field .",
    "heating of the polar - cap surface by a reverse flux of photo - electrons has been considered previously by cheng & ruderman ( 1977 ) , also by muslimov & tsygan ( 1987 ) in relation to an instability of a liquid surface under the boundary condition @xmath12 .",
    "the present paper is concerned not with heating effects but with the electrostatic consequences of the negative charge density that reverse - electron flow implies .",
    "there have been many calculations of the photo - electric cross - section for atomic hydrogen in the high magnetic fields and temperatures of model neutron - star atmospheres .",
    "we refer to potekhin & pavlov ( 1997 ) for a critical survey of this work and to potekhin , pavlov & ventura ( 1997 ) for a study of the adiabatic approximation used by many authors .",
    "although model atmospheres containing low-@xmath13 elements have been constructed ( see , for example , mori & ho 2007 ) , there appear to be no published explicit photo - electric cross - sections for such elements in high magnetic fields . also , the intervals of electron separation and photon energies relevant to the accelerated ions in the present work differ from those of neutron - star atmospheres .",
    "but the requirements of this paper have some simple features compared with the latter problem .",
    "it is not necessary to consider the complexities of thermal ion motion transverse to the field and , in particular , the photon momentum component @xmath14 is such that in relation to the electron cyclotron radius @xmath15 , the condition @xmath16 is always satisfied .",
    "hence simple expressions , valid only in this limit , have been derived and are given in appendix a. the zero - field cross - sections have been computed extensively ( see , for example , the work of reilman & manson 1979 ) and in approximations much superior to those of appendix a , but nevertheless we show that use of the high - magnetic field expressions is essential in this paper .",
    "the region of open magnetosphere above the polar cap is assumed to have a circular cross - section of radius @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the coordinate on the magnetic axis and @xmath19 is the neutron - star radius .",
    "the acceleration field has two components .",
    "the first , present at very low altitudes @xmath20 above the polar - cap surface , is the inertially - generated field described by michel ( 1974 ) .",
    "the second , and much the more important , contribution is produced by the lense - thirring effect modification to the corotational charge density first recognized by muslimov & tsygan ( 1992 ) and extends over moderately large distances @xmath21 .",
    "the computational results of this paper are contained in table 1 , which gives the charge evolution of typical ions as they are accelerated .",
    "the photon source is modelled as a polar cap of radius @xmath22 and proper - frame temperature @xmath23 embedded in a spherical neutron - star surface of uniform temperature @xmath24 .",
    "we find that the latter temperature is much the more significant but , unfortunately , it is essentially unknown in the case of the general isolated neutron - star population .",
    "blackbody emission has been detected reliably in only a small number of pulsars with ages less than @xmath25 yr ( see the review of yakovlev & pethick 2004 ) and even then there remains the problem of deciding whether the source is the polar cap or the whole surface .",
    "section 2 considers the simplest possible acceleration process : one that is time - independent and in a common state of plasma composition over the whole polar cap .",
    "it is shown that , in this case , acceleration is inadequate to produce secondary electron - positron cascades except for values of @xmath24 that are too small to be observable .",
    "the relation between this result and earlier work on space - charge limited flow in the @xmath26 case ( papers i and ii ) is discussed in section 3 .",
    "the flux of ions that are relativistic but not ultra - relativistic is unstable against growth of a quasi - longitudinal langmuir mode at rates that appear large enough to produce langmuir solitons and strong turbulence ( weatherall 1997 , 1998 ; melrose 2000 ; melikidze gil & pataraya 2000 ; asseo & porzio 2006 ) .",
    "solutions for the charge density @xmath27 , for @xmath28 and the electrostatic potential @xmath29 have been obtained for space - charge limited flow in a dipole field by muslimov & harding ( 1997 ) and by harding & muslimov ( 2001 ) .",
    "these authors considered electrons , for which the inertial component of the acceleration field is negligible . for ion acceleration , the inertial component , though less important than the lense - thirring induced term should be included .",
    "the expressions given by muslimov & harding are complicated and therefore we shall make use of the boundary condition and geometrical form of the open flux - line magnetosphere to obtain a very simple approximate expression for @xmath29 which is adequate for the purposes of this paper .",
    "we calculate the photo - electric transition rate for an ion accelerated to lorentz factor @xmath30 at altitude @xmath31 above the magnetic pole .",
    "there is little information about electron separation energies for multiply ionized atoms in the magnetic fields , @xmath32 g of interest here . the most recent calculations ( medin & lai 2006 ) are restricted to atomic numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 and further , in the latter case to @xmath35 g. we therefore adopt the expression used previously ( jones 1981 ) for the separation energy @xmath36 , @xmath37 in which @xmath38 is the electron spatial degeneracy quantum number .",
    "when summed over all @xmath39 , equation ( 1 ) gives agreement with the directly computed total energies of atoms with atomic numbers @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( see jones 1985 ) that is adequate for the work of this paper .",
    "the inertial component of the acceleration field can be found at small @xmath20 by means of a one - dimensional approximation to the poisson equation which neglects the boundary condition on the cylindrical surface @xmath42 separating open and closed flux lines , @xmath43 for ions of mass @xmath44 and charge @xmath45 .",
    "the field increases from the boundary condition @xmath11 to this constant value in a very small distance @xmath46 photo - electric absorption of blackbody photons modifies @xmath47 by introducing the negative charge density of the electrons accelerated toward the polar - cap surface . to estimate their effect",
    ", we can assume that the transitions all occur at a unique altitude @xmath48 , increase the ion charge from @xmath45 to @xmath49 , and reduce the field to @xmath50 at @xmath48 .",
    "then , @xmath51 and the ion lorentz factor at @xmath48 is , @xmath52 the electron chemical potential in the upper , low - density , regions of the atmosphere at the polar cap surface is , @xmath53 at electron number density @xmath54 .",
    "we have estimated @xmath45 by comparing the value of @xmath55 on the surface of last scattering in the atmosphere prior to acceleration with the @xmath36 given by equation ( 1 ) . on this basis , and because the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath56 is only logarithmic , we have adopted the condition @xmath57 to obtain the @xmath45 used in table 1 .",
    "the polar - cap radius is that given by harding & muslimov ( 2001 ) , @xmath58 in which @xmath59 is the rotation period and @xmath60 for a neutron star of mass @xmath61 and radius @xmath62 cm .",
    "the inertial component of @xmath47 ceases to be significant at @xmath63 cm . in principle ,",
    "calculation of the electric potential @xmath29 at @xmath64 requires the solutions given by harding and muslimov .",
    "but at @xmath65 a very simple expression can be found on the basis that the open flux lines are contained within a narrow cylindrical tube whose cross - sectional area increases only slowly with @xmath31 .",
    "given the boundary condition @xmath66 on the surface @xmath42 and that the radial electric field is @xmath67 , application of gauss s theorem to a section of the tube at altitude @xmath31 gives the approximation , @xmath68 in terms of the difference between the charge density @xmath69 and the goldreich - julian charge density @xmath70 .",
    "we refer to harding & muslimov ( 2001 ) for this quantity at polar coordinate @xmath71 and adopt the expression , @xmath72 in which we have neglected a second term containing @xmath73 which is small at altitudes @xmath74 of order unity .",
    "equation ( 9 ) assumes a dipole field with surface value @xmath56 . here , @xmath75 is the dimensionless lense - thirring factor and @xmath76 is the angle between @xmath2 and @xmath3 . this expression is a satisfactory approximation at @xmath77 and @xmath78 . at these altitudes ,",
    "the function @xmath79 including the red - shift factor @xmath80 can be well - approximated by unity and is a slowly varying function of @xmath74 .",
    "equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) define the acceleration of an ion and give the relation between the altitude @xmath74 and the lorentz factor @xmath30 and we restrict transition rate calculations to points on the magnetic axis ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the neutron - star surface is assumed to be lambertian",
    ". then unit element of surface area at a point which subtends an angle @xmath82 with the magnetic polar axis produces a photon number flux , @xmath83 at altitude @xmath84 on the axis , in which the photon occupation number is @xmath85 for photons of angular frequency @xmath86 .",
    "the photon momenta from this element are at an angle @xmath87 with the magnetic axis .",
    "lorentz transformation parallel with @xmath3 to the rest frame of an ion on the axis moving outward with lorentz factor @xmath30 gives the flux in that frame , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 replace @xmath86 amd @xmath87 , and @xmath91 is the ion velocity in units of @xmath92 .",
    "the photo - electric transition rate transformed back to the neutron - star frame at an altitude @xmath93 on the magnetic axis is , @xmath94 in which the upper limit of integration is given by @xmath95 and the integral is in two sectors ; the polar cap with temperature @xmath23 and radius given by equation ( 7 ) , and the remaining visible neutron - star surface of temperature @xmath24 .",
    "the cross - section is @xmath96 . here",
    ", the subscripts denote the landau quantum number of the final electron .",
    "the photon polarization is denoted by the superscripts @xmath97 , respectively perpendicular to or parallel with @xmath98 .",
    "general - relativistic corrections to photon propagation , including the red - shift factor , have been neglected here in equations ( 10 ) - ( 12 ) .",
    "equation ( 12 ) gives the transition rate as a function of the coordinate @xmath74 on the magnetic axis and the lorentz factor @xmath30 of the ion . owing to the geometrical restriction of equation ( 12 ) to points on the magnetic axis , transition rates for ions accelerated",
    "off - axis at finite @xmath99 would be in error to a modest extent for the polar - cap contribution , but for the much more significant whole - surface term , the error is negligible . we refer to appendix a for details of the individual cross - sections . approximations and sources of error are also discussed there , as is the comparison with zero - field cross - sections .",
    "the integration in equation ( 12 ) is over the polar cap with temperature @xmath23 and the remaining visible part of the neutron - star surface at temperature @xmath24 . from the transition rates and the relations between @xmath30 and @xmath31 given by equations ( 2 ) - ( 5 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) ,",
    "two optical depths have been determined for three values each of nuclear charge and polar - cap magnetic flux density .",
    "these are , @xmath100 which defines @xmath49 for a given @xmath101 .",
    "its dependence on @xmath24 is negligibly small principally because the factor @xmath102 .",
    "the second optical depth is , @xmath103 which gives @xmath104 and is almost completely independent of @xmath23 owing to the unfavourable nature of the lorentz transformation for polar - cap photons at @xmath105 . in both cases ,",
    "integer charges are determined by whether or not the optical depth concerned is greater or less than unity .",
    "this is usually obvious because optical depths decrease rapidly with increasing ion charge and electron separation energy .",
    "equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are based on the effect of reverse - electron negative charge density at @xmath20 .",
    "photo - electric absorption at @xmath65 also introduces a reverse - electron flux and negative charge density in any interval of @xmath31 in which there is a finite @xmath47 .",
    "thus @xmath106 for ultra - relativistic ions is not constant but is a function of @xmath31 determined by the local transition rate , @xmath107 and so reduces the acceleration field obtained from equation ( 8) . there can be acceleration in any interval of @xmath31 only if photo - electric rates are such that @xmath108 and this condition leads at once to the inequality , @xmath109 in which the fractional error in the right - hand term is of order @xmath75 relative to unity , and @xmath110 is the local value of the ion charge . because the principal aim of this calculation is to see if there can be sufficient acceleration to produce electron - positron pair creation , we adopt the following procedure .",
    "we scale @xmath29 so as to give an ion lorentz factor @xmath111 at @xmath112 , that is , a potential difference of about @xmath113 gev .",
    "then the lowest ion charge that has less than unit optical depth in the interval @xmath114 is defined as @xmath104 .",
    "but if this acceleration is to be possible , photo - electric rates must not exceed the limit defined above . on integrating ( 15 ) , we find that @xmath104 must satisfy the approximate inequality @xmath115 for consistency .",
    "this condition is maintained by an equilibrium such that the acceleration field satisfying poisson s equation adjusts to those values that give the ion acceleration and photo - electric transition rates necessary for self - consistency . to enlarge on this",
    ", we can note that if photo - ionization were complete at an altitude @xmath116 , acceleration of the bare nucleus would continue at @xmath117 , the potential difference remaining for this being approximately @xmath118 .",
    "but integration of ( 15 ) for this case gives the approximate constraint , @xmath119 so that values of @xmath120 for which continued acceleration is possible are severely constrained .",
    "the equilibrium we have mentioned above means that the acceleration field given by poisson s equation adjusts at all @xmath31 to that required for photo - ionization transition rates no larger than those satisfying the inequality ( 15 ) .",
    "reference to table 1 shows that continued acceleration over a potential difference approaching the maximum given by equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) is not possible except for low @xmath56 and high values of @xmath23 .",
    "the optical depth integration is continued to @xmath121 although the major contribution is from much lower altitudes .",
    "but the local magnetic flux density is much reduced near @xmath112 and therefore the separation energy used is the greater of that given by equation ( 1 ) or a zero - field expression given by a rydberg formula in terms of the screened nuclear charge and the appropriate principal quantum number for the electron shell .",
    "the table shows that @xmath49 differs little from @xmath45 for any values of @xmath56 and @xmath23 .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "firstly , the cross - section for transitions to the lowest landau state , the only final electron state accessible at low values of @xmath30 , contains the factor @xmath122 , which is always small .",
    "thus use of the zero - field cross - section in this region would be quite incorrect .",
    "secondly , as previously explained in relation to equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , the reverse - electron negative charge density itself limits acceleration at @xmath123 .",
    "most photo - electric absorption occurs at @xmath65 , is @xmath24-dependent , and consists of transitions to the @xmath124 landau state whose cross - sections contain @xmath125 .",
    "these , of course , require acceleration to higher lorentz factors .",
    "the estimate of the lense - thirring parameter used by muslimov & harding ( 1997 ) is @xmath126 .",
    "values of @xmath104 are given for neutron - star surface temperature @xmath127 k in column 6 and by reference to the integrated form of ( 15 ) show that @xmath128 is such that acceleration is not always possible even at this low temperature . at @xmath129",
    "k , acceleration occurs only in the limited number of cases in which high values of @xmath23 give @xmath130 .",
    "because @xmath49 differs little from @xmath45 , we can see that the basic uncertainty is in the latter quantity .",
    "estimates more refined than our condition derived directly from equations ( 1 ) and ( 6 ) might give lower or higher values of @xmath45 . in the former case , values of @xmath49",
    "would also be smaller , hence the possibility of significant acceleration would be reduced . in the latter ,",
    "@xmath128 would be reduced . however ,",
    "if photo - electric ionization is complete at @xmath48 , the energy flux of reverse electrons is very limited .",
    "typically , for @xmath131 , equation ( 5 ) shows that the reverse electron energy input to the polar cap is no more than @xmath132 gev per ion , giving only low rates of pair creation by inverse compton scattering or by ( n,@xmath30 ) reactions .",
    "the values of polar - cap magnetic flux density considered in table 1 were chosen so as include the median and mean values of @xmath133 for the wang , manchester & johnston ( 2007 ) catalogue of pulsars that exhibit nulls .",
    "for fields much smaller than @xmath134 g , the approximation @xmath16 made in appendix a fails , landau level spacings become small , and the photo - electric cross - section approaches the zero - field value .",
    "thus transition rates remain high . on the basis of table 1 , we find , with some confidence , that the muslimov - tsygan acceleration field is in general so reduced by electron production that electron - positron pair creation is not possible . in this state , which we assume to be time - independent , there is an equilibrium between the photo - electric transition rates and the ion acceleration needed to produce them . in many cases , ion lorentz factors at @xmath112",
    "may differ little from @xmath135 .",
    "our finding is limited , of course , to neutron stars whose whole - surface temperature is @xmath136 k. but a temperature of @xmath0 k is problematical from all points of view .",
    "it is unobservable in a compact source given present techniques and the energy flux needed to maintain it is small and easily supplied by many possible dissipative processes .",
    "also , measured photon spectra do not always allow the unambiguous separation of polar cap and whole - surface radiation .",
    ".for a range of values of polar - cap magnetic flux density , temperature and nuclear charge @xmath13 , values of the ion charge in local thermodynamic equilibrium immediately before acceleration ( @xmath45 ) and at the end of the first stage of acceleration ( @xmath49 ) are given .",
    "the ion charge at the end of acceleration @xmath104 is given in the right - hand four columns for arbitrarily selected values of the general surface temperature @xmath24 subject to the explanation and qualifications discussed in section 2 .",
    "for @xmath137 k , the ion charge is always @xmath138 . [ cols= \"",
    "> , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "the results described in the previous section are a further example of the diverse forms of polar - cap acceleration under the space - charge limited flow boundary condition that exist for the @xmath26 case .",
    "it was assumed that the composition of the accelerated plasma is uniform over the whole polar - cap area . before examining possible observable consequences of the uniform state",
    ", we need to mention briefly the impact of these results on the polar - cap acceleration which was considered at length in paper ii .",
    "we first comment on the assumed stability of the state described in section 2 . in the physical processes",
    "concerned , there is no obvious characteristic time apart from ion flight times which are of the order of @xmath139 s. this is many orders of magnitude shorter than the proton diffusion time constant @xmath140 defined in paper ii .",
    "thus we do not believe that the possibility of instability arising from photo - electric absorption can materially change the conclusions of that work .",
    "decay of the giant - dipole resonance formed in reverse - electron showers produces protons , and it was shown in papers i and ii that this process leads to temporal instabilities in the composition of the plasma accelerated .",
    "it was proposed that the consequences of these include the phenomena of nulls and sub - pulse drift observed in some radio pulsars .",
    "the number of protons created per unit ion charge accelerated , defined as @xmath141 in papers i and ii , is the significant parameter .",
    "it was shown in ii that , in general , the state of the polar - cap must be time - dependent , with any given element of area alternating between the acceleration of ions and positrons or of protons .",
    "in such an element , proton acceleration produces no reverse - electron flux and so must be of limited duration .",
    "it was assumed in paper ii that acceleration would be through the full potential difference given here by equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) , but this obviously needs some qualification . at any instant , there is positron and ion acceleration from only a fraction @xmath142 of the whole polar - cap area .",
    "thus the photo - electric production of negative charge is confined to this fraction and for @xmath143 the charge density averaged over the cross - sectional area @xmath144 does not differ much from that given by equation ( 9 ) . very roughly , the modified integrated form of ( 15 )",
    ", @xmath145 is now the necessary condition for the existence of a non - zero acceleration potential difference .",
    "the actual value of @xmath128 determines the amount by which the equilibrium acceleration potential is reduced from the full potential @xmath29 .",
    "inspection of @xmath128 values given in table 1 shows that , for @xmath146 and with the exception of @xmath147 k , the acceleration potential is usually a large fraction of @xmath29 .",
    "the uniform state considered here in section 2 is of interest in connection with the usual assumption that secondary low - energy electron - positron pair creation is necessary for coherent radio emission .",
    "it has no obvious mechanism for electron - positron pair formation and the assumption might well be that , in an isolated neutron star , it would correspond with a long null state of radio and polar - cap x - ray emission .",
    "however , the possibility that cold ions might be important in the growth of unstable quasi - longitudinal plasma modes was considered many years ago by cheng & ruderman ( 1980 ) , but it appeared that the longitudinal effective mass @xmath148 of the accelerated ions was too large to give the necessary growth rates .",
    "however , the small lorentz factors found here prompt reconsideration because the longitudinal effective mass is much reduced although the energy flux of the ions remains high in comparison with typical pulsar radio luminosities .    in the uniform composition state ,",
    "acceleration fields are everywhere small so that the reverse - electron energy flux gives values @xmath149 and a mixed plasma of ions and protons for which the instability arguments of papers i and ii are not necessarily valid .",
    "the plasma then has two cold components , ions and protons with small lorentz factors @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , with @xmath152 , and obviously satisfies the relativistic penrose condition ( see buschauer & benford 1977 ) .",
    "but because the plasma is cold , we can easily find the growth rate of the quasi - longitudinal langmuir mode studied by asseo , pelletier & sol ( 1990 ) for which the dispersion relation is , @xmath153 for angular frequency @xmath89 , wave vector @xmath154 , and at ion and proton velocities @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively . the remaining quantities are @xmath157 in which , @xmath158 where @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 are respectively the number density , charge and mass of each component @xmath162 . the rest - frame plasma frequency for a given component is @xmath163 and therefore ,",
    "following asseo et al , we consider the case @xmath164 and @xmath165 , defining a new variable @xmath166 through the relation , @xmath167 so that the dispersion relation becomes , @xmath168 in which @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "inspection of equation ( 20 ) shows that this quartic has two real roots which can easily be found numerically thus giving the remaining complex roots . in general ,",
    "the growth rate found from the complex roots is of the order of @xmath171 , but is smaller if another ion species with @xmath172is substituted in place of the proton beam .",
    "thus for a typical ion charge of @xmath173 and a proton beam of number density @xmath174 we can choose @xmath175 and @xmath176 , for which the amplitude growth rate is , @xmath177 rad s@xmath178 , at radius @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the polar - cap magnetic flux density in units of @xmath134 g and @xmath59 is the rotation period .",
    "the amplitude growth factor , assuming constant @xmath150 the interval @xmath181 , is @xmath182 , where , @xmath183 this is large for @xmath184 .",
    "values of the mode frequency are relatively small , @xmath185 , and may lie well below @xmath186 mhz , but it would be interesting to see if evidence for it is present in pulsar spectra at low frequencies .",
    "we have seen that the presence of ion and proton beams that are relativistic but not ultra - relativistic , previously unexpected in pulsars , can be associated with the growth of unstable quasi - longitudinal modes having growth rates high enough for the formation of langmuir solitons and strong turbulence .",
    "we can refer to the review of melrose ( 2000 ) and to the papers of weatherall ( 1997 ) and ( 1998 ) , melikidze et al ( 2000 ) and asseo & porzio ( 2006 ) to note that the collapse of such solitons is widely thought to be a plausible source for the coherent radio emission .",
    "it is usually assumed that the instability occurs in secondary electron and positron beams with lorentz factors of the order of @xmath187 but it is the macroscopic fields of the solitons that lead to coherent emission independently of the particle type from which they are formed .",
    "i thank the referee for directing my attention to the work of potekhin , pavlov & ventura ( 1997 ) on the limitations of the adiabatic approximation for the photo - ionization of atomic hydrogen in very strong magnetic fields .",

    "the presence of a high magnetic field greatly modifies the final states that are accessible to the electron in photo - electric absorption . in particular , the landau level spacing , @xmath188 kev at @xmath134 g , is large compared with blackbody photon energies . in the rest - frame of the accelerated ion , the photon momentum @xmath154 is almost parallel with @xmath3 and this much reduces transition rates to the @xmath189 landau state .",
    "we adopt the johnson & lippmann ( 1949 ) spinor solutions for a free electron in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "these are satisfactory here because we require only the cross - section @xmath190 to the unique @xmath189 ground state , and the sum of the cross - sections to the two degenerate @xmath124 states .",
    "photon polarization states are defined as those perpendicular to , or parallel with , @xmath191 and are denoted by superscripts @xmath192 respectively . for the explicit form of the solutions and of the interaction with the electromagnetic field",
    "it will be convenient here to refer to appendix a of jones ( 2010b ) .",
    "although with later comment , we assume the adiabatic approximation for the partially - ionized ground state in which the electrons occupy single - particle states each with landau quantum number @xmath189 .",
    "recoil is neglected so that in the ion rest frame , the photo - electric thresholds are @xmath193 , where @xmath36 is the separation energy given by equation ( 1 ) and @xmath194 is here the electron final state landau quantum number . following equation ( a6 ) of jones ( 2010b ) , the transition matrix element from a photon with angular frequency @xmath89 and polarization @xmath195 to the @xmath189 ground state with electron longitudinal momentum @xmath196 is , @xmath197 in cylindrical polar coordinates , where @xmath198 is the fourier transform of the model bound electron state @xmath199 , in which @xmath200 . the dependence of the cross - section on the charge of the ion is present solely through the fourier transform .",
    "the model function , which replicates the correct asymptotic form of the true function , given in this appendix by the parameter @xmath75 , is an adequate approximation for the purposes of this paper .",
    "the johnson & lippmann spinor for landau number @xmath201 is , @xmath202,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath203 , and the normalized functions @xmath204 are the non - relativistic radial solutions of the schrodinger equation for a free electron in a uniform magnetic field , in which @xmath39 is the spatial degeneracy quantum number ( see equations a3 - a5 of jones 2010b ) .",
    "the azimuthal angle - dependence is @xmath205 .",
    "the ion structure consists of spatially well - defined coaxial shells with sequential values @xmath206 and energies given by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the possibility of a hole state is not considered because its lifetime would be many orders of magnitude smaller than the photo - electric transition rates calculated here .    for the specific geometry of the photo - electric process",
    "considered here and for high fields @xmath207 g , the exponent in the matrix element , which is of the order of @xmath208 is always very small compared with unity and is set equal to zero .",
    "this introduces the selection rule @xmath209 which leads to an easy evaluation of the transition rates . hence , immediately from equation ( a1 ) , we obtain the cross - section , @xmath210 for transitions to the @xmath189 landau state for polarization perpendicular to @xmath191 . in the parallel polarization case ,",
    "the cross - section to the @xmath189 state is @xmath211 . proceeding in a similar way , the cross - sections to the two degenerate @xmath124 states are found to be , @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "it is to be emphasized again that these expressions are valid only under the condition that @xmath16 which is valid for the photo - electric process considered here .",
    "these cross - sections , not too far above threshold and at @xmath134 g , do not differ greatly from those given by the zero - field kramers formula apart from the presence of the @xmath122 factor in @xmath214 , and the zero parallel - polarization cross - section @xmath215 .",
    "these factors , within the adiabatic approximation , are a direct consequence of the relative orientation of the photon polarization vector and the magnetic field .",
    "transitions from @xmath189 to final states of @xmath216 have not been considered here because their matrix elements vanish in our approximation @xmath217 .",
    "the procedures used here are much inferior to those for zero - field cross - sections as in the work of reilman & manson ( 1979 ) , in particular , the unperturbed final - state wave function and the state of the initial bound electron .",
    "the latter has been treated in the adiabatic approximation as a single - particle state with good quantum numbers @xmath218 and @xmath39 .",
    "use of this approximation in the case of atomic hydrogen has been extensively studied by potekhin , pavlov & ventura ( 1997 ) .",
    "the true ground state contains small components with @xmath219 which lead to a non - zero value of the cross - section @xmath215 which increases in significance as the threshold for the @xmath124 final state is approached .",
    "the same is true for any single - particle state in a multi - electron ion .",
    "but in multi - electron ions , there are further problems . whilst",
    "a shell model is clearly the only useful basis for description of the atom , as in the zero - field case , there must be a residual electron - electron interaction whose matrix elements , though satisfying the @xmath209 selection rule overall , can introduce an @xmath124 and @xmath220 component into the @xmath189 and @xmath39 ground state and partially invalidate the adiabatic assumption .",
    "relative to unity , the amplitude of such a component would be of order @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is the matrix element , and is almost certainly very small .",
    "but the component has a photo - electric transition matrix element to the @xmath189 final electron state that is not inhibited by the @xmath223 factor .",
    "thus there must be a small non - zero value of @xmath215 and a correction to @xmath214 .",
    "clearly the cross - sections obtained here are subject to some uncertainty for the many reasons that have been discussed .",
    "however , we do not need great accuracy in the present work because the photo - electric transition rates required are also dependent on the high - frequency exponential tail of the blackbody spectrum and on the lorentz transformation to the ion rest frame .",
    "but it is important that cross - sections with the correct high - field landau level structure and dependence on photon polarization be used ."
