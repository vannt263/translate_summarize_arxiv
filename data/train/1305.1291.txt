    "a unit system is not simply a collection of units but an organized structure that enables diverse physical quantities to be represented in a unified manner . in order to define a unit system , we first select a few units ( quantities ) , which are referred to as _ base units_. other units are expressed as products or quotients of the base units and are referred to as _ derived units _ @xcite .",
    "it is a matter of choice how many base units are selected .",
    "a unit system with @xmath0 base units is called an @xmath0-base unit system .    with regard to unit systems , there are several naive questions : how should the base units be chosen ; how many base units should be chosen ; how can we convert systematically from one unit system to another ; what is the meaning of dimensions of quantities ( length , time , and so on ) @xcite .    in principle , the number and choice of base units are somewhat arbitrary .",
    "this is the reason why there has been proposed so many unit systems and standardization is strongly needed to avoid tangling of them .",
    "many modern articles on unit systems are focused on the unification of unit systems or on the international system of units ( si ) @xcite .    in the present paper , from more general point of view",
    ", we investigate the mathematical structure of unit systems and clarify the building principles and the relationship between them .",
    "we will show that a binary relation exists between unit systems . for certain pairs of unit systems , one of them",
    "can be derived or is _ transferable _ from the other .",
    "the transferability relation satisfies the mathematical axioms of _ preorder _ ( or _ quasi - order _ ) @xcite . for a given pair of unit systems ,",
    "the possibilities are : 1 ) one of the unit systems is transferable to the other unit system , 2 ) both unit systems are transferable to each other ( equivalent ) , or 3 ) neither unit system is transferable to the other unit system ( incomparable ) . it will be shown that the sorting of unit systems according to this preorder is much more significant than the simple sorting by the number of base units . especially , the equivalent case is important because with this relation of equivalence we can classify unit systems into equivalence classes .",
    "we call such a class as an _ equivalence class of unit systems _ ( eus )",
    ". we will also find that the set of eus s is a _ partially ordered _ set .",
    "we can draw a hierarchical tree of unit systems and eus s by using the preorder and partial order structures .",
    "the structure of orders and equivalence greatly helps us to sort out many existing and proposed unit systems .",
    "there have been few such general and systematic study on unit systems .",
    "we will find that representations of physical quantities and equations have the same form in unit systems belonging to an eus .",
    "therefore , the eus is a proper arena for quantity calculus , which is a very important tool in science and engineering .",
    "quantity calculus is closely connected with dimensional analysis @xcite .",
    "originally the dimensions of units or quantities are introduced in order to cope with the situation where various units were used for length , mass , and time @xcite .",
    "for example , the speed of light can be expressed in different units as , @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the unit for velocity is always expressed as a unit of length divided by a unit of time .",
    "we can write , independently of units , the dimension of @xmath2 as @xmath3 , with the dimensions for length @xmath4 , mass @xmath5 , and time @xmath6 . in electromagnetism",
    ", however , the situation becomes complicated .",
    "for example , in the meter - kilogram - second - ampere ( mksa ) system , the dimension for electric charge is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dimension for electric current , while in the centimeter - gram - second ( cgs ) gaussian system , it is @xmath9 .",
    "thus the notion of dimensions is in a somewhat ambiguous situation .",
    "it has been introduced to be independent of units but in fact depends on unit systems .",
    "this situation has been noticed in many articles@xcite , but no satisfactory explanation has been given . in this paper , we will show that the dimension is uniquely defined in each eus but it is dependent on eus s .",
    "the above contradiction can be solved if we understand that the mksa and cgs gaussian systems belong to different eus s , while the mechanical mks and cgs unit systems ( and other mechanical unit systems ) belong to a same eus .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly use electromagnetic unit systems as examples , because a rich variety of unit systems helps us to fully understand the present theory .",
    "it will be easy to apply the theory to other fields .",
    "we only deal with scalar quantities .",
    "generalization to geometric quantities such as vectors , tensors , and differential forms can be made @xcite .",
    "these multi - component quantities can be constructed from dimensioned scalars as in mathematics these are derived from real numbers .",
    "we consider an ensemble @xmath10 that contains all of the _ physical quantities _ under consideration . at this stage , we make minimum assumptions on the physical quantities in order to clarify the mathematical structures of unit systems .",
    "we assume that for an arbitrary quantity @xmath11 , the quantity @xmath12 , which is scaled by a real number @xmath13 , is also contained in @xmath10 .",
    "for such a scaled pair , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we define the sum as @xmath16 and call that @xmath14 and @xmath17 are addible in @xmath10 .",
    "negative quantities and subtraction can be considered with @xmath18 .",
    "a sum is not defined for unscaled pairs .",
    "we also assume that for any pair of nonzero quantities @xmath19 , and for any pair of rational numbers @xmath20 , the quantity @xmath21 is contained in @xmath10 . in other words , a product , a quotient , or a ( fractional ) power of quantities are defined .",
    "we now examine the role of the unit system . to define a unit system , @xmath22",
    ", we choose @xmath0 quantities @xmath23 @xmath24 that are to be referenced in the measurement of general quantities .",
    "these quantities are customary referred to as base units .",
    "the set of base units is represented by a vector , @xmath25 . a physical quantity @xmath11 is represented as @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the _ numerical value _ and @xmath28_u$ ] represents the unit .",
    "we refer to @xmath29 as the _ dimensional exponents _ of @xmath30 in the unit system @xmath22 .",
    "( the unfamiliar notation @xmath31 is borrowed from the notation @xmath32 for the vectorial inner product . )    for example , the magnetic flux quantum @xmath33 , defined in terms of planck s constant @xmath34 and the elementary charge @xmath35 , can be represented in the mksa system with @xmath36 as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39_u={{\\def\\o{\\mbox{o}}\\def\\u{\\mbox{u}}\\mathcode`\\u=\\mu\\mathcode`\\o=\\omega\\mathrm{m\\,kg\\,s^{-2}a^{-1}}}}$ ] , and @xmath40 .",

    "@xcite the representation @xmath42 , is derived from the corresponding quantity @xmath11 .",
    "the _ mapping _",
    "@xmath43 must satisfy the following properties :    1 .",
    "each base unit @xmath23 is mapped as , @xmath44 .",
    "2 .   for any @xmath11 with @xmath45 , and any @xmath13 , @xmath46 3 .   for nonzero quantities",
    "@xmath47 with representations @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and for @xmath20 , the quantity @xmath21 is represented as @xmath50 here , we can consider @xmath51 as a unit for measuring @xmath21 .",
    "a unit system that conforms to this condition is said to be _",
    "coherent_. 4 .",
    "if @xmath14 and @xmath17 are addible in @xmath10 , then @xmath14 and @xmath17 have the same dimension @xmath52 , and we have @xmath53 . 5 .",
    "even when @xmath30 and @xmath54 are not addible in @xmath10 , they may have the same dimension @xmath52 . in this case , we can write @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath30 and @xmath54 become addible in the unit system @xmath22 . the addibility is not universal , but unit - system dependent .",
    "the mapping @xmath56 is assumed to be surjective , namely , for any @xmath57 and @xmath58 , there corresponds a quantity @xmath11 that satisfies @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the unit system @xmath59 is characterized with the set of base units @xmath60 and the mapping @xmath61 .",
    "we denote the number of base units as @xmath62 .",
    "if , in a unit system @xmath22 , the presentations of two quantities @xmath30 and @xmath54 coincide , i.e. , @xmath63 , then we write @xmath64 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath64 indicates that @xmath65 and @xmath66 , for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "clearly , @xmath67 in @xmath10 implies that @xmath64 , although the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "generally , @xmath64 does not imply @xmath68 in another unit system @xmath69 .",
    "thus the equality `` @xmath70 '' is dependent on unit systems .",
    "we should be careful not to write an equation such as @xmath71 , even when @xmath72 and @xmath73 are derived from the same quantity @xmath11 .",

    "we have also found that an equivalence class of unit systems ( eus ) plays an important role .",
    "there is a _ partial - order _ structure among eus s with the relation @xmath198 , which is derived from the preorder @xmath98 .",
    "we have also drawn a ( partial ) hierarchical tree of existing unit systems and eus s in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "we have introduced three layers of description of physical quantities and their representations .",

    "the third layer is the representation @xmath242 ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) of a quantity @xmath30 in a unit system @xmath22 .",
    "although it is a concrete and definite mathematical object , the representation is dependent on the unit system .",
    "the intermediate layer is concerned with the e - quantity , which denotes collectively all of the representations in an eus as @xmath539 .",
    "the e - quantity is independent of unit systems as long as they belong to the same eus and has a definite dimension in the eus .",
    "generally , formulas and equations in physics should be understood to represent the relations of quantities rather than mere numbers . in terms of the present discussion , they specifically represent the relations of e - quantities rather than quantities in the naive sense .",
    "thus , the result of the present paper provides a theoretical background for quantity calculus and dimensional analysis .    in this paper , we have only dealt with scalar quantities .",
    "it is straightforward to extend to multi - component entities , such as vectors , tensors , differential forms and so on .",

    "as shown in theses examples , the coefficients could have different dimensions .",
    "but dimensions of ( co)vectors rectify them and yield the proper dimension for the vectorial or tensorial quantities , which is independent of coordinate system .",
    "these are also good examples of the buckingham pi theorem .",
    "the conversion from one unit system to another is sometimes troublesome , especially without a firm foothold .",
    "the present study reveals clear strategies for unit conversion . considering the preorder and partial - order structures and using the normalization",
    ", we can systematically compare the representations in different unit systems and set up the conversion rules .",
    "the meaning behind the corner - cutting method in which some quantities are considered to be unity to move from a unit system to another is clarified .    in the future , even after old unit systems have been abandoned , there will be a need for unit systems other than the present si , which itself may change according as science and technology develop@xcite .",

    "<S> , we can systematically compare the representations in different unit systems . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the equivalence class of unit systems ( eus ) plays an important role because the representations of physical quantities and equations are of the same form in unit systems belonging to an eus . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension of quantities is uniquely defined in each eus . </S>",
    "<S> the eus s form a _ partially ordered _ set . using these mathematical structures , unit systems and eus s </S>",
    "<S> are systematically classified and organized as a hierarchical tree . </S>"
