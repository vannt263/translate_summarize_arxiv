    "1995 ) .    in a few cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , which are closely related to symbiotic stars , rapid spectral changes are visible in optical and uv lines as a result of a variable accretion disk wind : bz cam ( ringwald & naylor 1998 ) , v592 cas ( witherick et al . 2003 ) , rw sex ( prinja et al . 2003 ) , v  603 aql ( prinja et al .",

    "this resolution is comparable with the time scale of flickering ( see for example zamanov et al .",

    "the profile is a little unusual , with 3 peaks or 2 absorption dips . during january 1999 ,",
    "the profile exhibits double peaks with a well defined central dip , which is partly due to the  absorption line of the red giant .",
    "the total ew ( ) was measured on each exposure in our sample .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[ewha ] . in the first three nights the variability is less than three times the estimated errors .",
    "on 990106 and 990107 it is about 5 times the error of the individual measurements .",

    "we used different wavelength intervals to produce different normalisations .",
    "this leads to changes of the absolute value of ew , but keeps the relative distributions of the points the same .",
    "the errors of the ew have been calculated from four measurements , with different normalizations .        in order to search for the variability in the line profile of h@xmath11 line during an individual night",
    ", we calculate the fractional variance spectrum based on all the data in each night : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of spectra , @xmath14 is the flux at wavelength @xmath4 of the @xmath15 spectrum and @xmath16 is the flux at that wavelength averaged over all spectra .",
    "the @xmath17 in the continuum should correspond to ( snr)@xmath9 , and hence a peak in @xmath17 should determine the significance of a variation .",
    "one other statistical technique which is particularly useful to accurately determine the spectral location of variability is the temporal variance spectrum ( prinja et al .",

    ".    following fullerton , gies & bolton ( 1996 ) , if the tvs for a spectral feature is above a specified level of significance then the null hypothesis of  no variability \" can be rejected .",
    "the statistical distribution of the tvs is governed by the the reduced chi - squared distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom and scaled with snr ( tvs@xmath24 ) . for the nights considered here",
    ", the statistical significance of 1% corresponds to tvs@xmath25=3.6 - 5.0% , depending on the number of spectra and snr . in the central part of the line the tvs is well above this level for 990106 and 990107 ( fig.[first ] ) .",
    "the peaks in @xmath17 correspond practically to the same confidence level of 3 standard deviations from the mean .",
    "this clearly shows that in these two nights there is statistically significant variability in the  line profile , at a confidence level of 0.99 , at a time resolution of @xmath110 min .",
    "for the two nights with detected variability , we subtract from the individual spectra the average spectrum , the minimum spectrum and the maximum spectrum .",
    "the average spectrum is defined as the average of the normalised flux for every pixel .",
    "the minimum ( maximum ) spectrum is defined as the minimal ( maximal ) value for each pixel .",

    "an artifact of data reduction we performed tests with data processing and normalisation , which showed that the detected variability on 990106 and 990107 is not an artificial result .",
    "fig.[simul]b shows the results from two different extractions and normalisations which have identical @xmath17 peaks .",
    "although the sky conditions looked like photometric during the time of the observations we can not exclude the possibility that the variable atmospheric lines and small wavelength shifts from spectrum to spectrum can result in spurious variability . to test the variability these effects could produce , we artificially introduced random shifts in wavelength up to 3 .",
    "we also isolated athmosperic absorption lines from a high snr spectrum of spica ( @xmath11 vir ) and introduced variable atmospheric absorption in the spectra .",
    "we find that both efects can produce variability , but this variability is lower than the noise in tvs and @xmath17 and can not account for the observed peaks .",
    "it is known ( i.e. zamanov & bruch 1998 ) that the hot continuum , which flickers on time scales of minutes with amplitude 0.2 - 0.3 mag in u , contributes about 15% of the average flux in the v band . to check whether the variability detected in  is due to the changing continuum level caused by the flickering of the hot component",
    ", we simulate @xmath17 in such a case by supposing that the hot continuum flickers with amplitude @xmath025 - 30% and contributes 15% of the flux in the continuum around .",
    "the amplitude is chosen to be slightly higher than the highest one observed in the u band after the subtraction of the red giant contribution ( see zamanov & bruch 1998 ) .",

    "this indicates that this variability originates in the outer parts of the  emitting region .",
    "assuming keplerian motion , a 1.4 m@xmath8 white dwarf , and inclination 67@xmath28 ( i.e. stanishev et al . 2004 and references therein ) this corresponds to a distance @xmath2920 - 25r@xmath8 .    mass accretion in t crb is occurring via roche lobe overflow .",
    "as the stream of gas flows away from l@xmath2 it forms a ring ( see verbunt 1982 ) .",

    "the radius of the ring can be estimated from ( hessman & hopp 1990 ) : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the semi - major axis and @xmath32 is the mass ratio of giant to white dwarf . for t crb q=0.82@xmath00.10 and @xmath33 r@xmath8 ( stanishev et al . 2004 ) , which places the ring at 20 r@xmath8 . at this location ,",
    "the keplerian velocity is about 115 , which is similar to @xmath34 of the detected variability .",
    "however , the keplerian time scale is about 18 days , which is not comparable with the timing of our observations .",
    "this suggests that the variability is not produced by an inhomogeneous disc structure .",
    "the observed behaviour of  emission from t  crb with time resolution 10 - 15 minutes is different from that of ch  cyg and of the variable winds observed in some cvs .",

    "1996 ) , nor high velocity components observed in the variable disk winds of some cvs ( prinja et al .",
    ". it might be that they are not detectable in our h@xmath11 profiles , even though they may exist and could be detected in the uv , where the hot component is the dominant source of radiation .",
    "one possible explanation for the detected variability could be variable absorption from the wind of the giant or from the accretion stream .",
    "it is worth noting , that no variability in the line is observed at orbital phases where the line of sight passes through the expected position of maximum absorption from the red giant wind .",
    "another cause could be additional emission from the area where the accretion stream hits the disk ( the hot spot ) .",
    "it is possible that a variable component with ew@xmath350.5always exists , but when the line is strong it is lost in the line ( e.g. 980415 ) .",
    "an additional plausible explanation is that the variable continuum arising from the central part of the accretion disk ( where the flickering in u arises ) changes the ionisation state of the outer regions of the ( flared ) disk , from which the central part of the emission lines arise .",
    "this possibility deserves further exploration .",
    "we searched for rapid  variability in the spectra of the recurrent nova t  crb . on 2 nights out of 5 ,",
    "we detect statistically significant variability at time resolution of 10 - 20 minutes .",
    "the detected variability is confined to the central part of the line profile at @xmath0100 , which suggests that variations are produced in the outer parts of the accretion disk ( @xmath3620 r@xmath8 ) . on these two nights",
    "there is evidence for variability of the total ew ( ) ( in all cases it is calculated relative to the average value , see table 1 ) with amplitude @xmath08% for 990106 and @xmath06% for 990107 , which is approximately five times the error of the individual measurements .    for the other 3 nights of observations we do not detect line profile changes .",
