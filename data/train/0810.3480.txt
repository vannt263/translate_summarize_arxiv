    "casimir forces @xcite between mesoscopic or macroscopic objects as well as casimir - polder forces @xcite between an atom and a surface can be attributed to a reordering of fluctuations in the quantum vacuum .",
    "recent years have witnessed considerable progress in measuring these forces @xcite , paving the way for future application in micro- and nanomechanical engineering and single - atom manipulation .    particularly for such applications , standard calculational techniques for simple flat surfaces are insufficient and a profound understanding of the influence of geometry on these quantum forces is required .",
    "in fact , since fluctuations occur on all momentum or length scales , quantum forces are strongly affected by the global properties of a given system . from a technical perspective , global properties such as geometry or curvature dependencies generally require a full understanding of the fluctuation spectrum in a given configuration and can not be dealt with by perturbative expansions with respect to a small geometry parameter .",
    "therefore , a variety of new field - theoretical methods for understanding and computing fluctuation phenomena have been developed in the past few years , such that early phenomenological recipes , such as the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite have been overcome by now .",
    "apart from exact results in certain asymptotic limits @xcite and more controllable approximation techniques @xcite , field - theoretical worldline methods have lead to efficient algorithms for casimir energies @xcite . in addition , approaches based on scattering theory have proved most successful for finding new exact solutions and efficient computation schemes @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "new results with direct mode summation have been obtained in @xcite ; numerical tools based on brute - force discretization have been used in @xcite .",
    "many of these approaches can be directly linked with a constrained - functional - integral formulation , as first introduced in @xcite for the parallel - plate case and further developed for corrugated surfaces in @xcite and lastly extended to general dispersive forces between structured media @xcite . for casimir forces involving corrugated surfaces , results based on a perturbative expansion in the height profile",
    "have been obtained recently @xcite .",
    "whereas most of these approaches have been mainly applied to casimir forces between extended objects , the casimir - polder force between an atom and a surface of general shape has not been so widely studied .",
    "an estimate of the influence of surface roughness has been given in @xcite , where an additivity approximation has been perturbatively expanded in the roughness amplitude . in @xcite , it was pointed out that large geometry corrections to the casimir - polder force should be observable for atoms in front of a corrugated surface , potentially visible in experiments with cold atoms near a surface .",
    "these studies were based on a perturbative analysis in the height profile .",
    "if the height - profile parameters are of the same order as the atom - wall distance , however , geometry plays a much more dominant role and perturbative theory is expected to be no longer appropriate . whereas cold atom gas experiments become increasingly difficult in this regime , casimir - polder force measurements can be well controlled in this regime .",
    "in particular the atomic beam spin echo technique introduced in @xcite has recently demonstrated high resolution access to some of the fundamental issues concerning casimir interactions .",
    "experimental results on geometrical effects will be presented elsewhere shortly @xcite .",
    "this work is devoted to a nonperturbative study of casimir - polder forces near a surface with uniaxial corrugation .",
    "our method is based on the constrained - functional - integral approach which facilitates to map the core part of the problem onto a one - dimensional green s function problem along the direction of nontrivial curvature of the surface .",
    "as this green s function problem involves singular kernels , we identify an appropriate representation which is accessible to stable and efficient numerical tools . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider a fluctuating scalar field obeying dirichlet boundary conditions instead of the full electromagnetic field .",
    "hence , our results should not be directly applied to realistic atom - wall studies ; they are applicable to casimir configurations in ultracold - gas systems as suggested in @xcite .",
    "our method is not restricted to dirichlet scalars and can straightforwardly be generalized to the electromagnetic case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : scalar_ft_boundaries ] , we review the treatment of casimir forces within scalar qft and give the general casimir energy for two dirichlet surfaces . within this formulation ,",
    "we then evaluate the casimir energy in sect .",
    "[ sec : planar ] for a sphere and a planar surface in the limit @xmath0 to first order explicitly .",
    "this limit defines the scalar analogue of the casimir - polder force . in sect .",
    "[ sec : corrugated ] , we extend our technique to the case of uniaxially corrugated surfaces . in sect .",
    "[ sec : sinus ] , we present numerical results for the scalar casimir - polder potential for a sinusoidally shaped surface as well as for a saw tooth profile , both of which have been used in experiments @xcite .",
    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the casimir energy of a system is given by the shift of the ground state energy caused by the presence of boundaries imposing constraints on the fluctuating field .",
    "for calculating casimir forces between disconnected bodies , only the casimir interaction energy is relevant .",
    "the latter corresponds to that part of the ground state shift which depends on the relative position and orientation of all bodies .",
    "the casimir self - energies of single bodies are irrelevant for the casimir force .    here",
    ", we investigate the casimir interaction energy induced by fluctuations of a scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "we follow the constrained - functional - integral approach @xcite , which is introduced in the following in a brief and simplified manner , see @xcite for a more detailed discussion and generalizations .",
    "we start from the associated euclidean generating functional , @xmath2 the casimir interaction energy of a system bounded by two surfaces , whose relative position is specified ( e.g. , by a ( mean ) separation @xmath3 ) , is then given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 stands for the generating functional of the fluctuating field obeying the system s boundary conditions , whereas @xmath6 represents the case of infinite separation between the objects , i.e. , @xmath7 . in this way ,",
    "irrelevant casimir self - energies are subtracted .",
    "the length in euclidean time direction is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the fields are implemented by insertion of a @xmath9 functional constraint into @xmath10 . for the case of dirichlet boundary conditions , the corresponding @xmath9 functional",
    "can be represented by product of @xmath9 functions @xmath11 for all 4-vectors @xmath12 pointing onto a surface @xmath13 ; here , @xmath14 labels multiple disjoint surfaces .",
    "hence , @xmath5 for dirichlet boundaries in the case of two plates is given by @xmath15 in order to evaluate the integral over the fields @xmath1 , a fourier representation is used for the @xmath9 functional with the help of auxiliary fields that have support only on the surfaces @xmath13 .",
    "first performing the gauian integral over @xmath1 leaves us ",
    "apart from an irrelevant factor  with another gauian integral for the auxiliary fields which can also be carried out , yielding for the casimir interaction energy , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes a matrix whose entries are the propagators of the fluctuating scalar , i.e. , the green s function of the laplacian in this case , @xmath18 with four - vectors @xmath19 and @xmath20 pointing onto the surfaces @xmath13 and @xmath21 , respectively . at the same time , @xmath17 is the inverse of the auxiliary - field propagator on the surfaces .",
    "complications of eq .   are hidden in the fact that the trace has to be evaluated over the spacetime hypersurface of the boundaries only , as specified by the support of the auxiliary fields .",
    "as the surfaces can be curved , this requires appropriate metric factors for the spatial integration measures ( see below ) .",
    "the normalizing operator @xmath22 corresponds to the propagator at infinite separation of the surfaces and takes care of the self - energy subtraction . for the case of two surfaces",
    ", @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24 where the matrix components distinguish between spacetime arguments `` living '' on the two different surfaces , i.e. , @xmath25 . in the matrix product , an integration over the connecting intermediate spacetime points",
    "is implicitly understood . due to the normalization with @xmath22 , only the off - diagonal elements are non - trivial , as they contain information about the propagation of fluctuations between the two different surfaces .    in order to compute the casimir energy from eq.([e_ln_m_overm ] ) explicitly , we introduce the off - diagonal matrix @xmath26 , @xmath27 such that a series expansion of the logarithm in eq.([e_ln_m_overm ] ) yields @xmath28 due to its off - diagonal structure , only even powers of @xmath29 contribute to the casimir energy . performing the discrete trace over the matrix entries then yields by the cyclicity of the trace @xmath30 thus , the casimir energy can be understood as a sum over all generic `` chains '' of correlators between the surfaces . starting from a generic point on surface @xmath31 ,",
    "it is summed over all possible auxiliary - field or source correlators on the surface itself , followed by all possible @xmath1 propagations to the second surface @xmath32 , then generic source propagations on @xmath32 itself and all thinkable ways back to @xmath31 again . as a last step ,",
    "these casimir contributions are summed over all possible starting points .",
    "within the language of scattering theory , @xmath33 is related to the @xmath34 matrix associated with scattering off the surface @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "equation is a useful starting point for explicit computations for a given configuration .",
    "for instance for two parallel dirichlet planes , the trace turns out to be proportional to @xmath35 , yielding the scalar analogue to casimir s celebrated result upon summation over @xmath36 .",
    "the present formalism can straightforwardly be generalized to neumann or electromagnetic boundary conditions by insertion of the corresponding @xmath9 functional constraint .",
    "the formalism has also been worked out for dielectric materials and fluctuations in media from which lifshitz theory @xcite can immediately be derived @xcite .",
    "arbitrarily curved surfaces require the knowledge of @xmath33 for both surfaces , which is equivalent to working out the @xmath34 matrix ( or @xmath37 matrix ) of the corresponding scattering problem .",
    "moreover , an efficient means to carry out the remaining summation and integrations is needed as well .",
    "the casimir - polder force between an atom and a plane wall at a distance @xmath3 is easily derived from lifshitz theory for two parallel plates .",
    "consider one of the plates as consisting of a dilute dielectric with a dielectric permittivity @xmath38 .",
    "here , @xmath14 denotes the polarizability of the atoms in the surface and @xmath39 is the number of atoms per unit area in the surface . expanding the casimir force from lifshitz theory to first order in @xmath39 yields the casimir - polder force between one of the atoms in the dielectric and the opposite wall as the prefactor at order @xmath39 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , can not simply be applied to the case of an atom near a corrugated surface , since the prefactor at order @xmath39 is an average over all possible atom positions at a given mean distance @xmath3 above the corrugated surface .",
    "hence , the important information about the dependence of the force on lateral coordinates is not available in this manner .",
    "this information can be extracted following a different strategy .",
    "as the casimir - polder force arises from the atom s polarizability , i.e. , the dipole transition induced by the fluctuating field , we can represent the atom by a compact surface with suitable polarization properties .",
    "the simplest case is , of course , a small sphere of radius @xmath40 . in the limit @xmath41 , the lowest non - vanishing inducible multipole moment ,",
    "i.e. , the dipole polarizability in this case , dominates the casimir interaction between the small sphere and the corrugated surface .",
    "hence , identifying this dipole polarizability of the sphere with that of an atom yields the casimir - polder law in this limit .    in this section",
    ", we proceed in exactly this fashion for the dirichlet scalar case , i.e. , we define the casimir - polder law in this case as the casimir force between a small sphere of radius @xmath40 and a corrugated wall at ( mean ) distance @xmath3 in the limit of @xmath41 . here the lowest multipole contribution of a small sphere is that of a monopole excitation , hence the resulting power law @xcite with distance @xmath3 will be different to that of the electromagnetic case , but it is straight forward to generalize this approach and computational strategy to the electromagnetic case .    as an exercise , we start with the planar case , identifying the planar surface with @xmath42 parametrized by the spatial coordinate @xmath43 . the center of the sphere ( surface @xmath44 ) of radius @xmath40 is located at @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the singularity structure of the involved propagators is not entirely trivial and special care has to be taken to choose the proper order of limits and integrations .",
    "of the four correlators occurring in eq.([e_tr_cycle ] ) , we begin with the contraction of the inverse propagator on the plane with the propagator between the surfaces .    specifying eq.([greens_fct_for_del_square ] ) for the plane @xmath31 results in @xmath47 $ ] , where @xmath48 , i.e. , the @xmath49 coordinate perpendicular to the plane drops out . by fourier transforming the propagator to postion space , we obtain the functional inverse , @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "this operator can immediately be contracted with the correlator between the plane and the sphere yielding @xmath52 since the setup is translationally invariant in time direction , it is expedient to fourier transform the propagators to frequency space with respect to the time coordinate .",
    "the singularity structure can be well controlled using a propertime integral representation ( with propertime @xmath37 ) .",
    "in addition , we parametrize the surface of the sphere @xmath44 by spherical coordinates .",

    "next , the inverse propagator @xmath58 on the sphere @xmath32 can be determined from @xmath59 which in terms of spherical coordinates reads @xmath60 with @xmath61 given by eq .  , and @xmath62 .",

    ", as discussed below .",
    "this term reads @xmath67 let us now rescale all dimensionful quantities by the scale set by the sphere - plate distance @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and consequently also the propertime parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in the limit @xmath72 , the inverse propagator on the sphere can be expanded as @xmath73 even though @xmath54 ranges from 0 to @xmath74 , the @xmath75 integral receives its dominant contributions from @xmath76 , such that the order estimate of eq .",
    "is meaningful .",
    "the inverse propagator @xmath58 thus becomes independent of the imaginary frequency to lowest order .",
    "collecting all the dimensionful factors from the rescaling , the trace eq.([trmmm_z_xp_o_o ] ) turns out to be of order @xmath77 and the remaining dimensionless integrals are a pure function of @xmath78 . in the limit",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 become independent of @xmath56 and @xmath81 , such that the two solid - angle integrations just contribute a factor of @xmath82 .",

    "the result for the lowest - order trace term then reads @xmath89 as higher orders in the @xmath36 sum involve more propagators between the sphere and the plate and consequently further powers of @xmath3 in the denominator , only the @xmath90 term survives in the casimir - polder limit . using eq .",
    "( [ e_tr_cycle ] ) , the energy between the sphere and the plane consequently yields in the casimir - polder limit @xmath41 @xmath91 which agrees with @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , the spatial integrations over the surface of the sphere @xmath32 become trivial in the casimir - polder limit . due to this fact , the integrations over the remaining lateral coordinates @xmath55 on the plate ( cf .",
    "could also have been performed in momentum space since the flat plate itself is translationally invariant along these directions . however , in the following section we will extend our investigations to surfaces which are uniaxially structured along the direction @xmath92 . for this purpose , it is expedient to fourier transform eqs.([tr_plate_kugel_dimensionless ] ) and ( [ deltam12_m21_resc_proptime ] ) only with respect to the 2-component @xmath93 to momentum space .",
    "due to a remaining lorentz invariance in time and @xmath94 direction , the integrand only depends on the combination of momenta @xmath95 , such that we obtain @xmath96 after the execution of the @xmath88 and @xmath87 integrals , the propagators are given by modified bessel functions of the second kind , @xmath97 this representation is suitable for a generalization to a uniaxially corrugated surface , as is done in the next section .",

    "by contrast , a structure on the surface breaks translational invariance in the direction of corrugation and the functional inverse of @xmath106 is not known analytically in the general case .",

    "we finally get @xmath119 this equation is indeed more suitable for a numerical integration . as a final step , we again go over to dimensionless variables by rescaling all dimensionful quantities by the distance parameter @xmath3 . also introducing the combined momentum @xmath120 results in @xmath121 where we have dropped the coordinate subscript `` 1 '' , since @xmath122 is the only relevant direction in this green s function problem .",

    "the casimir - polder limit is obtained in the limit of the sphere radius @xmath40 being much smaller than any other scale , @xmath130 , where @xmath131 denotes a typical amplitude of the corrugation and @xmath132 a typical corrugation wavelength . the factor @xmath14 thus is a function of @xmath133 , but it is independent of @xmath40 .    from a technical perspective , the result of eqs .",
    ", is very simple .",
    "it should be stressed that already the first trace term in the initial casimir - energy formula includes nine integrations for the trace : one over the imaginary frequency and four times two integrations over the lateral surface coordinates . due to the trivial dependency of the integrand on the lateral coordinates of the sphere in the casimir - polder limit , the number of integrations",
    "was then reduced by four ; moreover , the @xmath36 sum is just replaced by its first term in this limit .",
    "the emerging translational invariance vertical to the direction of corrugation reduces the number of integrations by another two . thus  instead of",
    "nine  we are left with three integrations : two of them are directly visible in eq .  , the third one is needed for the construction of @xmath118 as a solution of eq .  .",
    "these simplifications make the casimir - polder limit accessible to numerical integration for arbitrary height profiles .",

    "this requires to invert the propagator @xmath124 on the corrugated surface . even though the singularity of this propagator at coincident points is integrable in the continuum , the discretized version needs to deal with this singularity explicitly",
    "this is done by introducing a regularization parametrized by a short - distance cutoff @xmath144 , which can be removed after the continuum limit has been taken .",
    "details of how this procedure is implemented numerically are given in appendix [ sec : details ] .    in the following , we display our results for the casimir - polder energy always normalized with respect to the planar - surface case ( for consistency , the normalization factor is also determined numerically ) .",
    "in this manner , the geometry - induced effects are better visible .",

    "it is clear that the ratio @xmath153 as @xmath154 , since the corrugation can not be resolved anymore for greater distances .",

    ", we have studied the dirichlet scalar analogue of the electromagnetic casimir - polder case , defined by a fluctuating scalar field satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions on the surface and the `` atom '' ; the latter is modeled by a small sphere in the limit of zero radius in our approach .",
    "two periodic corrugations , a sine and a sawtooth function , are studied in detail , revealing various regimes with distinct distance dependencies . for a classification of these distance dependencies ,",
    "we have introduced the notion of an anomalous dimension characterizing the deviation of the distance power law of the casimir - polder potential from the planar case . in particular , the larger - distance behavior @xmath214 exhibits two different power - law behaviors with positive anomalous dimensions above a corrugation minimum and with negative anomalous dimensions above a corrugation maximum . in either case , the intermediate distance behavior near @xmath200 is characterized by an anomalous dimension , the modulus of which increases linearly with the corrugation frequency .",
    "most importantly , we have identified a larger - distance regime near @xmath216 where all data above a corrugation minimum is characterized by a universal anomalous dimension @xmath194 .",
    "this anomalous dimension still depends on the position above the corrugation , e.g. , @xmath220 above a minimum , but we have found no dependence neither on the shape of the periodic profile nor on the frequency as long as @xmath187 . within the worldline picture of the quantum vacuum where fluctuation averages are mapped onto random - path averages , this universality can be understood from the fact that small - scale structures are averaged out and become irrelevant at larger distances .",
    "this observation also justifies to use the notion of universality and anomalous dimensions , since the fluctuation averages are reminiscent to those of critical phenomena .",
    "the resulting casimir - polder potential can be viewed as a `` renormalized '' effective hamiltonian where the running ir cutoff is provided by the atom - wall distance .",
    "we would like to stress that this universality as well as the nontrivial power - law behavior can not be deduced from a perturbative analysis , since perturbation theory in the height profile is a taylor expansion in powers of @xmath221 , whereas a nontrivial anomalous dimension @xmath222 corresponds to a @xmath223 dependence of the casimir - polder law .",
    "therefore , the development and use of a nonperturbative method was absolutely crucial for this work .",
    "even though we only considered the dirichlet scalar case , the constrained - functional - integral formalism can straightforwardly be extended to the electromagnetic case as well @xcite which carries over to a straightforward generalization of our techniques . since no monopole fluctuations exist in the electromagnetic case due to charge conservation , the leading - order casimir - polder potential in the planar case follows a @xmath224 distance law instead of @xmath225 in the present case .",
    "but apart from this , we do not expect further dramatic differences as far as the corrugation - dependencies are concerned .",
    "therefore , the dirichlet scalar case may be taken as a rough qualitative estimate also for the electromagnetic case ; in particular , we expect the occurrence of anomalous dimensions of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the notion of anomalous dimension is also of direct use for casimir - polder experiments based on quantum reflection such as the atom - beam spin echo technique @xcite . in a certain sense ,",
    "such an experiment measures the local shape of a potential and thus is directly sensitive to anomalous dimensions .",
    "indeed , the results of recent measurements with corrugated surfaces can be parametrized by anomalous dimensions of order one . of course , a direct comparison between our results and those of an experiment requires much more than the computation of anomalous dimensions , since the atoms near the wall can move into all directions and not only along the global normal .",
    "the full casimir - polder potential needs to be mapped out , and the time - dependent quantum reflection problem in this potential has to be solved . in any case , the approach presented here lays the foundation for this future program .",

    "one serious complication arises when discretizing eq . : due to the pole of the zeroth bessel function @xmath250 at its origin , the matrix @xmath251 that emerges upon the discretization of the spatial arguments diverges in its diagonal entries , i.e. , for the case when the spatial discretization sites lie on top of each other .",
    "whereas these divergencies are integrable when solving the problem in the continuum , the discretized matrix becomes singular .",
    "therefore , a regularization procedure is required that facilitates to first take the continuum limit before the regulator can safely be removed .",
    "here , we use a uv regularization for the propagator in eq . for small arguments @xmath252 controlled by a small parameter @xmath144 : @xmath253 where @xmath252 summarizes all arguments of the propagator including both spatial and momentum contributions , entering the bessel function as a single argument , cf .",
