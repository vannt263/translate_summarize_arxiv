    "recently a new resonance which is compatible with the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) with a mass of 125 gev has been discovery at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "as is well known in the context of that model , nothing constraints the number of fermion generations although , since the lep data , we know that there exist only three sequential generations of quarks and leptons . this triplication may also exist in the scalar sector since here again , nothing constraints the number of higgs scalar multiplets and , in particular , the number of higgs doublets is a free parameter in the model , although one of them is enough to accommodate vector and fermion masses and their mixing . in this vain",
    "the multi - higgs extensions of the standard model are among the most motivated new physics scenarios .",
    "generally these models have scalar mediated flavor changing neutral currents . even in the simplest case , the two - higgs doublet models , have several possibilities to control those effects  @xcite . three - higgs doublet models  @xcite have not been considered with the same details as those of the two - higgs doublet case . this is not a surprise since in this case the analysis of the scalar potential is much more complicated",
    ". however , discrete symmetries may simplified the scalar potential , for example the @xmath1 symmetry has been considered in ref .",
    "recently , it was shown that the @xmath0 symmetry is very efficient to constraint the scalar potential allowing to obtain the mass spectra and the matrix which diagonalize the mass square matrices  @xcite .",
    "the symmetries for the two - higgs doublet model was obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and in the case of three - higgs doublet models in @xcite .",
    "if one or more extra higgs doublets do exist in nature it seems that their existence is due to some reason that allows to explain something else that could not be explained by the minimal model , i.e. , with only one higgs doublet . on one hand , it is possible that extra scalars may explain the mass spectra and mixing in the fermion sectors  @xcite , or on the other hand , it is possible that the extra higgs doublets may help to understand the observed dark matter . in the latter case",
    "the extra higgs bosons have to be of the fermiophobic type  @xcite .",
    "the fermiophobic higgs boson is defined as : all the fermion couplings to the higgs boson are set to zero and the bosonic couplings are the same as in the standard model .",
    "this in fact has been already considered in the case of one fermiophobic doublet - higgs model  @xcite . here",
    "we will consider the lhc phenomenology of the three doublet model with @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite which was put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite and which has two fermiophobic doublets .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the next section we review the main feature of the three scalars model . in sec .",
    "iii we give the interactions of the model . in subsec .",
    "iiia the yukawa interactions , in subsec .",
    "iiib the gauge interactions while in subsecs .",

    "iv we show the decay rate into two photon of the sm - like neutral scalar .",
    "we devote sec .",
    "v for our conclusions . in the appendix",
    "a we show how the mass spectra are modified if we add soft terms to the scalar potential .",
    "let us consider an extension of the sm electroweak theory which consists in adding two extra scalars , @xmath2 doublets , with @xmath3 .",
    "the three scalar doublets are in a singlet @xmath4 and a doublet @xmath5 of @xmath0 . the @xmath6 invariant scalar potential",
    "is given by @xmath7 where : @xmath8_1   + \\lambda_1 ( [ d^\\dagger\\otimes   d]_1)^2 +   \\lambda_2 [ ( d^\\dagger\\otimes d)_{1^\\prime}(d^\\dagger\\otimes d)_{1^\\prime}]_1 \\nonumber \\\\ &",

    "the effects of the soft terms on the scalar masses are considered in the appendix  [ sec : softterms ] .",
    "there are two ways to build the singlet @xmath4 and the doublet @xmath5 which are not equivalent . in the first one , we call model a , the reducible triplet representation of the discrete symmetry  @xmath0  :  @xmath10 with the usual notation @xmath11 in which @xmath12",
    ". this reducible representation is the direct sum of one singlet and one doublet @xmath13 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are give by @xmath14\\sim\\textbf{2 } , \\label{ma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the other way , we denote model b , is such that @xmath15 we also impose a vacuum alignment in each case : @xmath16 and @xmath17 in model a and b , respectively .",
    "this vacuum alignment give a global and stable minimum of the scalar potential if other conditions are satisfied too  @xcite .",
    "in both cases the constraint equations reduce to @xmath18 which implies that @xmath19 .",
    "the difference is that @xmath20 in the model a , and @xmath21 , in model b , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .    with the scalar potential in eq .",
    "( [ potential1 ] ) in model a the mixing matrix in all the scalar , pseudoscalar and charged scalar sectors is given by the tribimaximal matrix @xmath22 and the masses are the following : in the @xmath23 even sector @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and denoting as @xmath26 the mass eigenstates , we have @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is given in ( [ tribi ] ) .",
    "the scalar @xmath29 can be identified with the standard model higgs scalar .    in the cp - odd neutral scalars sector , we obtain the following masses : @xmath30 denoting @xmath31 the pseudo - scalar mass eigenstates , we have @xmath32 .    similarly in the charged scalars sector",
    "we obtain the following masses : @xmath33 and denoting @xmath34 denote the charged scalar symmetry eigenstates and @xmath35 the respective mass eigenstates , we have @xmath36 .    in model a the @xmath37 doublets can be written in terms of the mass eigenstates using the mixing matrix em eq.([tribi ] ) , resulting in : @xmath38    however , in model b the mass matrices are diagonal , i.e. there is no mixing in each charge sector . in general , the eigenvalues are equal to those in eq.([mrs1 ] ) for @xmath23 even sector , eq.([mps1 ] ) for @xmath23 odd sector and eq.([mcs1 ] ) for the charged scalar sector , respectively .",
    "notice that the mass degeneracy in the fermiophobic sector is a prediction of the @xmath0 symmetry but there may be accidental mass degeneracy with the sm - like higgs boson too .",
    "the possibility that two mass degenerated higgs bosons with mass near the 125 gev has been discussed in literature  @xcite .",
    "the main difference with the present model is that two of the higgs doublets are fermiophobic , they do not interact with quarks or leptons at tree level . on the other hand , they can be produced in accelerators like the lep by the higgstrahlung mechanism @xmath39 or in hadronic colliders @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes any neutral scalar .",
    "moreover , since they are fermiophobic scalars they do not decay into fermions and they behave as invisible higgses .",
    "bounds on the masses of femiophobic higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel exclude this sort of scalars in the ranges 110 - 118 gev and 119.5 and 121 gev  @xcite .",
    "this is the case of the fermiophobic higgs in the present model .",
    "moreover , the decay @xmath42 is exactly the same as in the sm since only one of the neutral scalar ( the one which is not fermiophobic , @xmath43 ) contributes to these decays .",
    "the yukawa interactions are equal in both models when vacua are aligned as before",
    ". only one of the doublets interacts with quarks and leptons and the other two are fermiophobic doublets . in the lepton sector",

    "the models are different in their trilinear and cuartic interactions but they have a dark degenerate scalar spectrum . the interactions of the sm - like higgs boson are identical to the sm .",
    "therefore , the only effect from the dark scalars is in the one loop processes like the higgs boson into two photon decay .",
    "we have evaluated the reduced fraction @xmath94 in order to get constraints for the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath78 of the model a. on the other hand , models a and b are predicting the same @xmath116 width decay but they are not equivalent in the invisible modes . in general",
    "a fermiophobic neutral scalar decays to @xmath117and @xmath118 bosons proceeds as in the sm , while the decay to photons proceeds via @xmath119 loops , since its decays to photons via fermion loops are excluded .",
    "if this were the case for the doublet of the standard model i.e. , if the fermion masses have a different origin from that of the gauge boson , it is excluded at 95% confidence level in the mass range @xmath120 gev , and at 99% confidence level in the mass ranges @xmath121 gev , @xmath122 gev , and @xmath123 gev  @xcite .",
    "notice that in this case there is a small windows around 124.5 - 127 gev .",
    "hence , the constraints above are not directly applicable to the model considered in this work that has the usual higgs doublet plus two dark doublets .",
    "however in the present model , fermions masses arise from the higgs doublet which also contributes to the gauge boson masses but the latter particles also have contributions from the dark doublets .",
    "note that for the calculations performed in this work we consider that @xmath124 , since they do not contribute in the photon - photon loop , however , as a result of this assumption , the charged boson is lighter than the neutral boson , some values are shown in table 1 . as a consequence",
    "the neutral scalar is not a good candidate for dark matter .",
    "however , if we consider that good candidates for dark matter must satisfy the relation @xmath125 implying @xmath126 , is easy to see that , for example , with @xmath127 gev , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 we obtained @xmath131 gev and @xmath132 , thus we can have a dark matter scenario in these models by imposing that the inequality must be satisfied .",
