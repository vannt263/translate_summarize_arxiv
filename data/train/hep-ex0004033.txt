    "inclusive measurements of charmed baryon decay products provide essential information on the relative contributions of different decay processes ( e.g. , external w - emission , internal w - emission , w - exchange ) to the weak @xmath38 transition in baryons .",
    "difficulties in distinguishing direct charm decay products from jet fragmentation particles have hampered such inclusive measurements .",
    "an example is the measurement of @xmath39 ( although @xmath40 here designates @xmath41 , charge conjugation is implicit throughout ) .",
    "using the total @xmath1 yield at @xmath6 = 10 gev / c to measure @xmath42 requires separating the @xmath1 component due to light quark fragmentation from production via @xmath43 .",
    "the difficulty of separating fragmentation @xmath1 s from those resulting from @xmath44 decays can be overcome by using a tagged sample of @xmath0 events . in this analysis ,",
    "we use charm - event tagging to measure the product of the likelihood for a charm quark to materialize as a charmed baryon @xmath4 times the branching fraction for a charmed baryon to decay into a @xmath1 : @xmath45 . from jetset 7.3 monte carlo simulations , using the default lep - tuned control parameters , we expect that @xmath4688% of @xmath4 particles produced in @xmath0 fragmentation at @xmath6=10 gev will be @xmath44 s .    previous measurements of @xmath47 have either measured the increase in the @xmath1 production rate as the @xmath48 threshold is crossed@xcite , topologically tagged @xmath44 decays@xcite , or derived a value for @xmath47 based on measurements of baryon production in b - meson decay@xcite . knowing , for example , that @xmath49% , @xmath50% , and assuming that @xmath51x dominates baryon production in b - decay , with @xmath52 equally likely to be @xmath53 or @xmath54 , one can estimate : @xmath55=36% .",
    "this simple - minded estimate , however , needs to be modified to take into account many corrections , among them the recent result that @xmath56@xcite .",
    "that latter result implies that only @xmath462/3 of the inclusive ( @xmath57 ) yield in @xmath58-decay come from decays of charmed baryons ; the remainder is presumably due to associated production or decay of anticharm baryons . in this article",

    "this system achieves a momentum resolution of @xmath70 ( @xmath59 is the momentum , measured in gev / c ) .",
    "pulse height measurements in the main drift chamber provide specific ionization resolution of 5.5% for bhabha events , giving good @xmath71 separation for tracks with momenta up to 700 mev / c and separation of order 2@xmath72 in the relativistic rise region above 2 gev / c . outside",

    "two end - cap regions of the crystal calorimeter extend solid angle coverage to about 95% of @xmath75 , although energy resolution is not as good as that of the barrel region .",
    "the tracking system , time of flight counters , and calorimeter are all contained within a superconducting coil operated at 1.5 tesla .",
    "flux return and tracking chambers used for muon detection are located immediately outside the coil and in the two end - cap regions .    the event sample used for this measurement",

    "we note that the methodology of this analysis differs substantially from the previous cleo analysis@xcite , which relied on a model of charmed baryon production in b - decay to derive @xmath39 .",
    "naively , one might expect fragmentation and decay of charmed baryons to be similar to bottom baryons .",
    "using vertex tagging techniques , the opal collaboration has determined @xmath202 . perhaps the simplest way to reconcile the two numbers is to assume ( _ ad hoc _ ) that @xmath203 at @xmath20490 gev is approximately twice as large as @xmath179 at @xmath6=10 gev , and that @xmath2051.0 .",
    "however , the fact that the @xmath206 lifetime is only 2/3 that of the b - mesons , coupled with the fact that @xmath206 has already been observed through @xmath207 imply that @xmath208 .",
    "correspondingly , we expect an enhancement of @xmath203 at opal relative to @xmath179 at cleo .",
    "finally , we stress that our final central value for @xmath7 averages over the specific mix of charm - tags that we use in this analysis . the composition of our @xmath62-meson tags will not be the same as the composition of our electron tags , insofar as the lepton - tagged sample represents a weighted sum of @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212",
    ". our quoted final result can be general only if the two hemispheres in an @xmath0 event fragment independently .",
    "although not yet measured , it is possible that there may be correlated @xmath213 production , in which case the likelihood of observing @xmath214 would be larger for @xmath215 tags than for @xmath62 tags , and the assumption of independent fragmentation would be invalid . a study of correlated @xmath213 production , presently in progress , will be the subject of a forthcoming publication .",
