    "molecular electronics have been developed to realize biodegradable and large - area electronic products .",
    "these devices have been fabricated with various usges . as an instance , j.e .",
    "lilienfeld invented a method which was proposed to control electric currents.@xcite this method led to introduction of field - effect transistor which operates as a capacitor between a source and a drain electrode . in 1987 , the first organic field - effect transistor was made by koezuka and co - workers based on a polymer that is able to conduct charge , eliminating the need to use expensive metal oxide semiconductors.@xcite polymers have recently gained great interest as building blocks for electronic applications that require low - cost , and potentially flexible form  factors .",
    "usually , polymer synthesis methods are extremely affordable and apart from the technical physical considerations .",
    "there are many works on polymers and their applications such as drivers for electronic papers,@xcite radio - frequency recognition,@xcite and circuits for flat displays.@xcite when processed into thin films , polymers can be used to build transparent materials , taking advantage of their weak absorbance in the visible spectrum .",
    "invisible electronic circuits based on polymers are important for the uses requiring transparency , such as sensors and bendable displays .",
    "@xcite + recently , metal - molecule - metal ( mmm ) structures ( figure [ mmm ] ) have attracted scientists",
    ". their broad range of applications have led chemists , physicists , and other scientists and engineers engaged in organic electronics to produce devices with new abilities and have improved efficiencies relative to their primary counterparts  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , using polymers in electrical devices is a point of strength .",
    "specifically , we are interested in discussing around a mmm junction where the polymers serves as the center part . +        molecular properties include any of a material s properties that becomes evident during , or after , a chemical reaction and any property that is measurable , whose value describes a state of a physical system which are supervenient on the underlying atomic structure , which may in turn be supervenient on an underlying quantum structure .",
    "it may be difficult to determine whether a given property which can be seen and measured is a property that is emerged from quantum confinement or not . the best way to understand it is to get stuck into the theories . using this method of understanding can link properties together , even if one does nt have enough information about the story and the fact which is happened within the system .",
    "+ the rest challenge now is to find out how to express different properties of a polymer in terms of the ones of it s monomer .",
    "these properties are supervenient on the underlying atomic structure and the quantum indicators of the monomer .",
    "therefore , physical properties of polymers can be categorized as being either dependent or independent of the size of the polymer .",
    "+        due to the wideness of the types of polymers , the existence of theories and computational methods will be a big help for scientific progress .",
    "figure ( [ polymers ] ) shows some polymers which are defined by a repeated subunit .",
    "we are interested in the properties which are widely studied in many ways .",
    "the tight - binding or linear combination of the atomic orbitals  @xcite is one of the most important methods which is a semi - empirical method that is primarily used to calculate the eigen energies of the system .",
    "this method is simple and computationally very fast .",
    "+ the purpose of this essay is to introduce a new method for quantum simulation of the polymers as a function of their monomer . for the moment",
    ", this general outline may be sufficient , and the main approach and important topics , including the newly calculated properties , would be explained in the rest of the paper . in each section , we report on the present status of the approaches used in detail .",
    "in this section we are going to introduce an analytical method based on basic properties of matrices to calculate the properties of a polymer base system via green s theorem .",
    "the new method gives us several benefits with realy less computational effort than other methods , which could facilitate significantly the computations .",
    "because of the wide variety of polymers , it is helpful to classify them in a way that polymers are common on the number of the connections between repeated subunit . as shown in the figure ( [ polymers ] ) many of polymers have one bond between monomers .",
    "this subtle physical note is the basis point of this method .",
    "the most commonly used device geometry is a mmm system .",
    "green s function theory is selected to establish this method as a powerful and flexible approach for applying it to many types of polymers as the center part of the mmm system . to achieve this purpose",
    "we would write the general hamiltonian in tight - binding approximation , for such a polymer which contains @xmath0 monomers , via second quantization representation as follows    @xmath1    where the summations run over all atoms of the polymer .",
    "the prime on summation symbol omits the cases @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is the energy of the electrons at site @xmath4 , the complex numbers @xmath5 is the transfer energy between site @xmath4 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of electrons at site @xmath4 ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath9 stands on the number of the subunit ( @xmath10 $ ] ) and @xmath11 ( refers to the link between monomers ) is the transfer energy between the last atom of a subunit and the first atom of the next subunit .",
    "the equation [ eqhamiltonian ] can be written in matrix form as follows    @xmath12    let us to introduce some compact notations to explain a matrix . as usual @xmath13 is the element of the matrix @xmath14 .",
    "colon symbol is applied to extract parts of a matrix .",
    "generally , @xmath15 is the submatrix formed from rows @xmath16 through @xmath17 and columns @xmath9 through @xmath18 of the matrix @xmath14 , the matrix @xmath19 is equal to the square matrix @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a more compact form of @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is the dimention of the matrix @xmath14 .",
    "the order of the full matrix in the equation [ mainmatrix ] is @xmath24 in which @xmath18 is the number of atoms of the monomer .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 is the hamiltonian of the monomer and it s order is @xmath26 .",
    "recalling once again that , generally , the non - vanish element of the matrix @xmath27 is complex and defined by the equation    @xmath28    the idea is to calculate the determinant of the matrix @xmath29 and other properties using the determinant .",
    "now we define the new matrix @xmath30 ( the raising index is used to not have conflict with definition of the lowering index ) as follows    @xmath31    in which the elements of the matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined as    @xmath34    the matrix @xmath30 is a dummy matrix which helps us to achieve our purpose .",
    "the determinant of the matrix @xmath35 can be calculated in two ways as follows    @xmath36    we can eliminate the variable @xmath37 by subtraction of the two equations . in other words , we can get a recursive equation as following    @xmath38    in which the domain of @xmath39 is @xmath40 $ ] , the range of @xmath17 is @xmath41 $ ] , and therefore the index @xmath42 runs through @xmath43 $ ]",
    ". one can expand the equation [ recursiveeq ] ( by the parameter @xmath17 ) to a set of @xmath18 linear equations in @xmath18 unknowns determinants .",
    "these equations are recursive and can be put in the form of a matrix - vector equation by iterate this procedure @xmath44 times for the parameter @xmath39 as follows    @xmath45    in which @xmath46 is defined as following matrix    @xmath47    now , the challenge is to raise the square matrix @xmath46 in the equation [ matrixeq ] to the power of @xmath48 .",
    "one can change the basis of the matrix representation for which the matrix takes the diagonal form and after raising the matrix to the power of @xmath48 , change the basis of the new matrix to what it was before .",
    "so , the equation [ matrixeq ] becomes as follows    @xmath49    in which @xmath50 and @xmath51 are non - zero eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath46 , and @xmath52 is a matrix of the set of eigenvectors .",
    "the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 would be obtained as following equations    @xmath53    in which @xmath54 can be calculated as    @xmath55    also , @xmath52 should be obtained as following matrix    @xmath56    in which @xmath57 and @xmath58 would be defined as follows    @xmath59    now , we define two new functions    @xmath60    and    @xmath61    which are altered by the interactions of metals in the mmm system . to switch the open system to a mmm system",
    ", non - interacting hamiltonians must be replaced with the new ones .",
    "the idea is to add the interaction of the left ( right ) lead as a self - energy @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) to the on - site energy of the first ( last ) atom of the polymer .",
    "it should be noted that , the hamiltonian @xmath25 must be replaced by @xmath64 only in the last vector of the right hand side of the equation [ matrixeq2 ] .",
    "one can find the relation between the determinants of the new hamiltonians and the old ones as follows    @xmath65    one can substitute the expression [ selfenergies1 ] into the equation [ matrixeq2 ] and multiply matrices to get @xmath29 and @xmath66 .",
    "using the equation [ selfenergies2 ] , the expression for @xmath67 , after some simplifications , is given by the following    @xmath68    in which @xmath69 is defined as follows    @xmath70 \\biggl [ \\sigma _ r \\left(t_l^2\\left| h_{2:n-1}\\right| + \\left| h\\right| + \\lambda _ 2-\\lambda _ 1\\right)+2t_l^2   \\left| h_{2}\\right| \\biggr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equation [ deth ] gives us the determinant of the hamiltonian of a polymer which is affected by two leads .",
    "this expression is a function of some information which are lie at the homiltonian of the monomer and the hopping between the monomers .",
    "one needs the determinant @xmath71 to find the inverse of the matrix @xmath67 which is needed in order to calculate other electrical properties of the mmm system .",
    "green s function method is a powerful method to study the electronic properties of the mmm system . in this method ,",
    "the most important property of physical observables in transport , such as electrical current , is the transmission .",
    "the tight - binding description of transmission through a junction has been interesting for scientists to observe how much an electron wave packet would transmit in a specific energy .",
    "one needs the hamiltonian of the system ( equation [ eqhamiltonian ] ) which is expressed in the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the routine method based upon a formulation for the conductance in terms of green s functions @xmath72 is the well known fisher - lee linear - response @xcite for the conductance of a finite lattice embedded between the leads . at this point",
    "it is necessary to discuss that , for the mmm system which is studied in the current work , the transmission @xmath73 is a function of @xmath74 as seen in following equation    @xmath75    to find @xmath74 , one can calculate the adjugate of the matrix @xmath67 for the element @xmath76 only , and apply the following equation    @xmath77    we hence conclude that    @xmath78    in which @xmath79 refers to a mmm system in which the monomer is conected to the leads .",
    "it can be calculated as follows    @xmath80    also , the transmission function should be obtained as    @xmath81    and from the equation [ fisherleeeq ] we have the following expression for the transmission of a monomer @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83      to truly have complete information about a mmm system , we should know all of its possible energies . the number of states per interval of energy at each energy level that are available to be occupied is important for calculations of the effects based on the band theory like transition probability @xcite .",
    "the actual transition probability depends on how many states are available in both the initial and final energies .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) appears in calculations of conductivity where it presents the number of mobile states , and also in computing scattering rates where it presents the number of final states after scattering @xcite .",
    "dos is a function of energy that when multiplied by an interval of energy , provides the concentration of the states which are available in that range .",
    "before we can calculate the density of carriers in a polymer of interest , we have to find the number of available states at each energy .",
    "the green s function of the hamiltonian of the mmm system is a key concept with important links to the concept of dos via the following equation :    @xmath84    to calculate @xmath85 , one can use jacobi s formula@xcite , which expresses the derivative of the determinant of a matrix in terms of the adjugate of it .",
    "we hence conclude that    @xmath86    in which @xmath87 would be calculated by the equation [ deth ] which is a function of the monomer only .",
    "the work presented here will be given in terms of a physical quantity that describes the density of states , but space - resolved .",
    "local variations , most often due to distortions of the original system , are often called local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "we describe a method for calculation of the ldos on polymers and finding a relation between ldos of a desire polymer and that of its monomer .",
    "this relation can be used to gain keep insights into a subunit of the polymer as the main constituent . according to the formalism",
    "is used in the current work , one needs to calculate @xmath88 in the following equation    @xmath89    to calculate @xmath88 , one needs to find the cofactor for that element .",
    "let @xmath90 stands for the hamiltonian of the monomer in which the values on that row and column are ignored .",
    "subsequently , by the approach explained in the section [ method ] , @xmath91 would be defined as follows    @xmath92    and also , for the jth subunit one should obtain the following relation    @xmath93    in which @xmath94 stands for the full hamiltonian in which the values on the jth row and jth column in the jth subunit are ignored .",
    "after calculating the right hand side of the equation [ hjj ] by @xmath95 one can obtain the ldos for the first subunit of the monomer as follows    @xmath96    in which @xmath97 is defined as following expression    @xmath98\\bigg [ \\left.2 \\left| h_{1:n-1}\\right|   \\left(\\sigma _",

    "\\bigg ] \\right.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    it should be noted that , presented expression is a function of the hamiltonian of the monomer @xmath25 .",
    "just as a conclusion , ldos for the jth subunit can be calculated by the equation [ hjj ] in terms of the first subunit as the form below    @xmath99    or more avail form    @xmath100    in which @xmath101 would be defined as follows    @xmath102        to clarify and show the importance of the issue , the variations of the ldos of a typical polymer , contains five atoms in its monomer , is shown in figures [ ff1]a and [ ff1]b for different energies . as seen , @xmath101 is the frequency of ldos variations between subunits of the polymer . as shown in figure [ ff2]a ,",
    "the imaginary part of the fraction @xmath103 in some specific energies is zero for which @xmath101 would be equal to zero and ldos should be uniform through the polymer .",
    "figure [ ff2]b shows that , the ldos ( for a desire @xmath17 ) for these energies would not be changed in pass from a subunit to the next one .",
    "in summary , a metal - molecule - metal system has served as an interesting and widely used object of research in which the molecule is a polymer that is able to conduct charge .",
