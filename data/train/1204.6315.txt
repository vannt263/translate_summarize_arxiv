    "charged black holes in asymptotically anti - de sittter ( ads ) spacetime can be regarded as the gravitational dual description of certain strongly interacting fermionic systems at finite charge density , such as non - fermi liquids @xcite .",
    "this is an application of the gauge / gravity duality @xcite , which allows us to calculate fermionic green s function by solving the bulk dirac equation @xcite .",
    "a particularly well - studied example is the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole in ads as the geometry @xcite .",
    "we will focus instead on a particular dilatonic black hole in ads@xmath0 , explored originally in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite for related work .    the dilatonic black hole in question is sometimes referred to as the two - charge black hole . from a five - dimensional point of view , this is because two of the three mutually commuting @xmath5 subgroups of the @xmath6 gauge group of maximal gauged supergravity are nonzero and equal , while the third is zero . from a ten - dimensional point of view",
    ", this black hole describes @xmath7 coincident d3-branes with equal , nonzero angular momentum in two of the three independent planes of rotation orthogonal to the d3-brane world - volume .",
    "the dilatonic black hole enjoys several advantages over the better studied rn - ads@xmath0 black hole :    * the entropy and specific heat of the dilatonic black hole are proportional to temperature at low temperature , as compared to a nonzero , @xmath8 entropy at extremality for the rn - ads@xmath0 black hole . * exact information about the position and properties of fermi surfaces is available for the dilatonic black hole , for massless bulk fermion actions with no pauli couplings .",
    "this stands in contrast with the rn - ads@xmath0 black hole , where one must resort to numerics to find @xmath4 .",

    "* pair creation of fermions near the horizon , and back - reaction of the resulting fermionic matter , must distort the rn - ads@xmath0 geometry to some extent .",
    "but for the dilatonic black holes there is some evidence , to be explained below , that pair creation of fermions is suppressed .",
    "a notable disadvantage of the dilatonic black hole is that its extremal limit  which will be our main focus  has a naked singularity .",
    "any nonzero temperature cloaks the naked singularity with a horizon , but as temperature is taken to zero , the dilaton as well as curvature invariants become larger and larger at the horizon , until at zero temperature they diverge .",
    "nevertheless it is straightforward to pick out physically reasonable boundary conditions for fermions : in particular , for @xmath9 one can simply demand that the allowed solutions are regular as the naked singularity is approached .",
    "the main aim of the current work is to solve the massless dirac equation , @xmath10 in the extremal limit of the dilatonic black hole background , and to show that the corresponding green s function exhibits one or more fermi surfaces if @xmath11 . for @xmath12",
    ", there is only a single fermi surface , and @xmath13 is not well - defined . for @xmath14 , there is still only a single fermi surface , but @xmath13 is well defined . for @xmath15 , there are additional fermi surfaces at @xmath16 , where @xmath3 is a positive integer .",
