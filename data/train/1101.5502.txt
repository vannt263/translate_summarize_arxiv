    "<S> first shells of hydration and bulk solvent plays a crucial role in the folding of proteins . here </S>",
    "<S> , the role of water in the dynamics of proteins has been investigated using a theoretical protein - solvent model and a statistical physics approach . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate a hydration model where the hydrogen bonds between water molecules pertaining to the first shell of the protein conformation may be either mainly formed or broken . at thermal equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> hydrogen bonds are formed at low temperature and are broken at high temperature . to explore the solvent effect , we follow the folding of a large sampling of protein chains , using a master - equation evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics shows a clear mechanism . above the glass - transition temperature , </S>",
    "<S> a large ratio of chains fold very rapidly into the native structure irrespective of the temperature , following pathways of high transition rates through structures surrounded by the solvent with broken hydrogen bonds . although these states have an infinitesimal probability , they act as strong dynamical attractors and fast folding proceeds along these routes rather than pathways with small transition rates between configurations of much higher equilibrium probabilities . at a given low temperature , a broad jump in the folding times </S>",
    "<S> is observed . below this glass temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the pathways where hydrogen bonds are mainly formed become those of highest rates although with conformational changes of huge relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> the present results reveal that folding obeys a double - funnel mechanism .    to this date , </S>",
    "<S> the three - stranded @xmath0 sheet is the faster folder finding its native structure in the amazingly short time of 140 nano - seconds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the protein folding problem is still considered as one of the major unsolved problems of science  @xcite and the answer to the levinthal question  @xcite `` how a protein can fold so fast  ? '' remains a `` grand challenge ''  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> protein folding is the process whereby a protein folds into its native structure . </S>",
    "<S> the slowest folding proteins may require a few minutes due among other factors to proline isomerization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they fold passing through many intermediate states . on the other hand , many small single - domain proteins fold very rapidly over time scales of a few microseconds @xcite . for many of these proteins , </S>",
    "<S> the folding process is a single exponential function of time @xcite and is modeled by a two - state mass action model and an arrhenius diagram on which the free energy of some ensembles of chain conformations is plotted as a function of reaction coordinate , usually not known . </S>",
    "<S> this diagram exhibits a transition state between the unfolded and the native states @xcite .    moreover , some ultra fast folders exhibit more complex kinetics with non - arrhenius behavior @xcite ( i.e. non - linear dependence of the logarithm of the folding rate on the inverse of the temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> some results show that the activation energy is positive at room temperature , decreases as the temperature increases and may become negative at high temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that this could arise from the temperature dependence of the hydrophobic effect @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative to this transition - state view is the concept of folding funnel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this energy - landscape picture is based on the idea of minimal frustration @xcite , which states that the evolutionary mechanism has retained those protein sequences that have a funnel - like energy landscape . in that concept </S>",
    "<S> , the height of the funnel represents the conformational energy and its width represents the entropy of the subset of chain conformations of a given energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the top of the funnel is populated by the huge number of denaturated configurations with a large energy and entropy and the bottom with the unique native structure of very low energy and quasi - nil entropy . </S>",
    "<S> each protein chains folds from the top of the funnel towards the bottom . </S>",
    "<S> the transition - state theory and the folding - funnel picture are two different approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the first one describes well the two - state kinetics , but does not explain why folding is so fast . </S>",
    "<S> the second one explains well why folding is so fast , and the thermodynamic free energy barrier , that gives rise to two - state kinetics and makes transition - state theory applicable to the folding process , is essentially of entropic nature .    </S>",
    "<S> lattice models of proteins are among the favorite tools for the theoretical study of folding . the microscopic representation of the proteins is simplified to allow large sampling of the configurational space . </S>",
    "<S> proteins are modeled as self - avoiding - walk chains of beads , which are located on a two or three - dimensional square or cubic lattice . for small - length chains , </S>",
    "<S> a full enumeration of the conformations allows the exact calculation of the partition function , and , thus of statistical averages @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of a given conformation of the chain results from the interaction of the first neighbors of the beads on the lattice , but not in the sequence . the more popular model of couplings between monomers are known as the g@xcite , the hp @xcite and the random - energy model(rem ) @xcite . in the g model , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the beads of a given compact structure , chosen as the native conformation , is set to -1 and all the other couplings to 0 . in the hp model </S>",
    "<S> , the sequence of the protein is given in terms of a series of hydrophobic ( h ) or polar ( p ) residues and the coupling between two hydrophobic beads is set to -1 and that involving at least one polar monomers to 0 . in the rem , </S>",
    "<S> a matrix of couplings between all pairs of residues is constructed by drawing random numbers from a gaussian distribution .    despite the numerous results obtained with such models , they fail to reproduce a fundamental feature of a protein  : its cold denaturation . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is associated to the loss of stability of the native structure upon cooling down the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for half a century , it has been well known that water plays a crucial role in the mechanism of folding @xcite and an understanding of cold denaturation requires a finer model of the solvent than the temperature - independent attractive parameters used in g , hp or rem . </S>",
    "<S> some recent refinements of the models , including temperature dependence of the hydrophobic effect , have allowed to model the cold transition @xcite to be described .    as the physics of protein folding proceeds in water and the interactions of the protein chemical groups are solvent </S>",
    "<S> mediated , the representation of the solvent is of great importance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrophobic effect is an active field of research by itself @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it represents the tendency of water to exclude nonpolar solutes . </S>",
    "<S> it results from a disruption of the network of hydrogen bonds between water molecules caused by the transfer of an nonpolar solute into water . </S>",
    "<S> the energy variation of this process is favorable at room temperature , whereas the entropy cost leads to a large positive free energy of transfer . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the physics of the solvent - mediated interactions of the protein may be captured by studying the interaction of two nonpolar solutes immersed in water @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this prototypical interaction can be handled by averaging e.g. the degrees of freedom of the solvent in the free - energy function of two methane solutes in explicit water @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the profile of the free energy as a function of the distance between the two methane solutes shows a deep minimum for the contact distance between the two molecules and another one , less pronounced when they are separated by a distance slightly smaller than one solvent molecule diameter . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum , higher than the free energy of the two isolated solutes arises between these two configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this maximum is known as the desolvation barrier . as the temperature increases , </S>",
    "<S> the contact between the nonpolar solutes becomes more favorable as the desolvation barrier is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> this barrier tends to favor a high thermodynamic cooperativity of the model in contrast with a model without desolvation barrier @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been shown that the physics behind this barrier is responsible for the large diversity in the folding rates , similar to what is observed experimentally @xcite moreover , recent experimental work has shown that structural fluctuations of the solvent may control structural fluctuations of the protein @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been observed that motion of hydration water drives protein dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this could be responsible for the protein - solvent dynamical transition connected with the liquid glass transition of hydration water @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results show the importance of the degrees of freedom of the hydration first shell for the dynamics of the proteins . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical model of the hydrophobic effect introduced by muller @xcite and extended by lee and graziano @xcite allows to separate the contribution of the hydrogen bonds of the first shell and that of the bulk water . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea stems from the result that the hydration of nonpolar solutes presents a large entropy cost and a small favorable energy . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrogen bond breakage in the bulk is considered as a two - state equilibrium between the formed and the broken hydrogen bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium constant between the two states is related to the fraction of formed hydrogen bonds and to the difference in enthalpy and the ratio of degeneracy resulting from the breaking of one hydrogen bond . </S>",
    "<S> a similar description is used for to the water molecules of the first shell . </S>",
    "<S> it considers that the thermodynamics of a broken hydrogen bond in the first shell is the same than that in the bulk and gives a picture of the hydrophobic effect based on the enthalpy gain and entropy cost arising from the creation of a bond in both situations . </S>",
    "<S> a little bit later , lee and graziano @xcite pointed out that the energy associated to a broken hydrogen bond is not the same for a water molecule of the first shell and for one of the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of an nonpolar solute induces the breakage of a hydrogen bond of the first shell , leading to a more unfavorable energy than the same event in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the two - state model of the hydrophobic effect has been applied @xcite to the two - dimensional mercedes - benz model of water @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , they give a spectrum where the non - degenerated ground state is for the formed hydrogen bond in the first shell and the highly degenerated states for the broken hydrogen bond in the first shell corresponds to the larger value of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the energies and the degeneracies of the formed or broken bonds in the bulk are found between the two previously described .    in this paper , this picture has been reduced further by gathering together the two close energy levels associated to the broken and formed hydrogen bonds of bulk water @xcite and has been applied to a lattice model of protein to study the effect of the first shell on the protein dynamics . aside from the hydrophobic model itself , </S>",
    "<S> how the solvent is simulated has a significant impact on the energy landscape of the protein . </S>",
    "<S> explicit solvent models are very computationally expensive @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> implicit solvent models have been developed to take into account the solvent as a mean field effect @xcite . yet , results obtained from explicit simulations do not always agree with those from implicit models @xcite . up until now , </S>",
    "<S> the strategy to follow the kinetics of the proteins consisted in averaging the degrees of freedom of the solvent by calculating the free energy of solvation of each protein structure and the transition rates between two protein conformations . </S>",
    "<S> the system evolves along effective routes made of conformations surrounded by an averaged solvent . here , as the solvent model allows it , </S>",
    "<S> we have _ calculated the rate between two protein - solvent microscopic configurations and grouped together some equivalent transitions . _ </S>",
    "<S> the physical pathways are microscopic routes in the protein and the solvent configurational space , not `` mean '' routes in the conformational space of the protein surrounded by an effective solvent .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of a large set of chains in the solvent is calculated using a master equation evolution . in the spirit of the concept of folding funnel @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a picture of the folding in terms of two surfaces , depending on the state of the hydrogen bonds of the first shell solvent , drawn in an entropy - energy plot , is given . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanisms responsible for the fast folding and the glass transition are detailed in the body of the paper . in the first part , the protein and the solvent models are described . in the second part </S>",
    "<S> , the equations of the evolution are established . in the third part , the mechanism , which occurs during the fast overcoming of kinetic barriers </S>",
    "<S> is explained , then the mechanism responsible for the glass transition is revealed </S>",
