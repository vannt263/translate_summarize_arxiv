    "among various strategies employed by pathogens to evade the host immune system , a prominent place is occupied by antigenic variation .",
    "notable examples of pathogens relying on this strategy of immune escape include african trypanosoma , _ plasmodium falciparum _ , hiv , several members of _ neisseria _ family , _ haemophilus influenzae _ etc .",
    "despite the fact that some details of this mechanism are still unclear , the main features of this method of immune evasion are quite universal .",
    "the immune system of the host detects potential infection with a pathogen by identifying specific chemical determinants , such as proteins and carbohydrates , known as epitopes , on the surfaces of infected cells .",
    "this triggers the differentiation of precursor cells into effector cells , which are then able to eliminate the infection .",
    "some pathogens have evolved to have a wide variety of surface markers ( antigens ) , and by changing the antigens the present on the cell surface , these pathogens can for a long period of time remain unrecognized by the immune system , giving them an opportunity to be transmitted to other hosts .",
    "this process of sequentially presenting different antigens in order to avoid the host immune system is known as antigenic variation .",
    "there are several particular ways of implementing antigenic variation . in the case of _",
    "trypanosoma brucei _ , the organism that causes sleeping sickness , parasite covers itself with a dense homogeneous coat of variant surface glycoprotein ( vsg ) .",
    "genome of _ t.",
    "brucei _ has over 1000 genes that control the expression of vsg protein , and switching between them provides the mechanism of antigenic variation @xcite . what makes _ t. brucei _",
    "unique is the fact that unlike other pathogens , whose antigenic variation is typically mediated by dna rearrangements or transcriptional regulation , activation of vsgs requires recombination of vsg genes into an expression site ( es ) , which consists of a single _ vsg _ gene flanked by an upstream array of 70 base pair repeats and expression site associated genes ( esags ) .",
    "_ t. brucei _ expresses one vsg at any given time , and the active vsg can either be selected by activation of a previously silent es ( and there are up to 20 es sites ) , or by recombination of a vsg sequence into the active es .",
    "the precise mechanism of vsg switching has not been completely identified yet , but it has been suggested that the ordered appearance of different vsg variants is controlled by differential activation rates and density - dependent parasite differentiation @xcite .    for the malaria agent _",
    "p. falciparum _ , the main target of immune response is _ plasmodium falciparum _ erythrocyte membrane protein-1 ( pfemp1 ) , which is expressed from a diverse family of _ var _ genes , and each parasite genome contains approximately 60 _ var _ genes encoding different pfemp1 variants @xcite .",
    "the _ var _",
    "genes are expressed sequentially in a mutually exclusive manner , and this switching between expression of different _ var _ gene leads to the presentation of different variant surface antigens ( vsa ) on the surface of infected erythrocyte , thus providing a mechanism of antigenic variation @xcite . in all cases of antigenic variation ,",
    "host immune system has to go through a large repertoire of antigenic variants , and this provides parasites with enough time to get transmitted to another host or cause a subsequent infection with a different antigenic variant in the same host .    despite individual differences in the molecular implementation of antigenic variation , such as , gene conversion , site - specific dna inversions , hypermutation etc .",
    ", there are several features common to the dynamics of antigenic variation in all pathogens @xcite .",
    "these include ordered and often sequential appearance of parasitemia peaks corresponding to different antigenic variants , as well as certain degree of cross - reactivity .",
    "several mathematical models have been put forward that aim to explain various aspects of antigenic variation .",
    "_ @xcite have studied a model of antigenic variation of african trypanosomes which suggests that sequential appearance of different antigenic variants can be explained by fitness differences between single- and double - expressors - antigenic variants that express one or two vsgs . however , this idea is not supported by the experimental evidence arising from normal _ in vivo _ growth and reduced immunogenicity of artificially created double expressors @xcite .",
    "frank @xcite has suggested a model that highlights the importance of cross - reactivity between antigenic variants in facilitating optimal switching pattern that provides sequential dominance and extended infection .",
    "_ @xcite have considered variant - transcending immunity as a basis for competition between variants , which can promote oscillatory behaviour , but this failed to induce sequential expression .",
    "many other mathematical models of antigenic variation have been proposed and studied in the literature , but the discussion of their individuals merits and limitations is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the model considered in this paper is a modification of the model proposed by recker _",
    "@xcite ( to be referred to as recker model ) , which postulates that in addition to a highly variant - specific immune response , the dynamics of each variant is also affected by cross - reactive immune responses against a set of epitopes not unique to this variant .",
    "this assumption implies that each antigenic variant experiences two types of immune responses : a long - lasting immune response against epitopes unique to it , and a transient immune response against epitopes that it shares with other variants .",
    "the main impact of this model lies in its ability to explain a sequential appearance of antigenic variants purely on the basis of cross - reactive inhibitory immune responses between variants sharing some of their epitopes , without the need to resort to variable switch rates or growth rates ( see gupta @xcite for a discussion of several clinical studies in ghana , kenya and india , which support this theory ) .    in the case of non - decaying long - lasting immune response , numerical simulations in the original paper @xcite showed that eventually all antigenic variants will be cleared by the immune system , with specific immune responses reaching protective levels preventing each of the variants from showing up again .",
    "blyuss and gupta @xcite have demonstrated that the sequential appearance of parasitemia peaks during such immune clearance can be explained by the existence of a hypersurface of equilibria in the phase space of the system , with individual trajectories approaching this hypersurface and then being pushed away along stable / unstable manifolds of the saddle - centres lying on the hypersurface .",
    "they also numerically analysed robustness of synchronization between individual variants . under assumption of perfect synchrony ,",
    "when all variants are identical to each other , recker and gupta @xcite have analysed peak dynamics and threshold of chronicity , while mitchell and carr @xcite have considered the case of slowly decaying specific immune response .",
    "de leenheer and pilyugin @xcite have replaced linear growth of antigenic variants in the original model by the logistic growth , and have studied the effects of various types of cross - reactivity on the dynamics , ranging from no cross - reactivity to partial and complete cross - immunty .",
    "it is known that time delay in the immune response can have a profound effect on the dynamics of host - parasite interactions and the host ability to eliminate infection .",
    "several models have studied mathematically the effects of time delay on the immune dynamics and possible onset of oscillatory behaviour @xcite . for the recker model , mitchell and carr",
    "have investigated the effect of time delay in the development of immune response in the case of complete synchrony between antigenic variants @xcite , and they have also investigated the appearance of synchronous and asynchronous oscillations @xcite in the case of global coupling between variants ( referred to as `` perfect cross immunity '' in @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , we use methods of equivariant bifurcation theory for delay differential equations to study the dynamics of a fully symmetric state in the recker model .",
    "stability analysis of the appropriate characteristic equation will show that under certain conditions on parameters , this state can undergo hopf bifurcation , giving rise to different types of stable periodic solutions .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the mathematical model of antigenic variation with time delay in the immune response and discuss its main properties .",
    "section 3 discussed different steady states and derives the transcendental characteristic equation , which determines the stability of the fully symmetric state . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we analyse the case of small and arbitrary time delay , respectively , and find the boundary of hopf bifurcation in terms of system parameters and the immune delay .",
    "section 6 contains numerical simulations of the model and analysis of the symmetry properties of different periodic solutions .",
    "the paper concludes in section 7 with the discussion of results and an outlook .",
    "in this section , the model of the immune response to malaria is presented together with some facts about the dynamics of this system .",
    "following recker _",
    "@xcite , we assume that each antigenic variant @xmath0 consists of a single unique major epitope , that elicits a long - lived ( specific ) immune response , and also of several minor epitopes that are not unique to the variant . assuming that all variants have the same net growth rate @xmath1 , their temporal dynamics is described by the equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the rates of variant destruction by the long - lasting immune response @xmath5 and by the transient immune response @xmath6 , respectively , and index @xmath0 spans all possible variants .",
    "it is known that the discovery of infection by immune receptors does not instantaneously lead to the development of the corresponding immune response @xcite . to include this feature explicitly in the model ,",
    "we introduce time delay @xmath7 as the time delay that elapses between changes in parasitemia and production of the corresponding immune effectors @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", it will be assumed that this time delay is the same for both specific and cross - reactive immune responses .",
    "the dynamics of the variant - specific immune response can be written in its simplest form as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the proliferation rate , @xmath10 is the decay rate of the immune response , and @xmath7 is the above - mentioned time delay in the immune response . finally , the transient ( cross - reactive ) immune response can be described by a minor modification of the above equation ( [ zeq ] ) : @xmath11 where the sum is taken over all variants sharing the epitopes with the variant @xmath12 .",
    "we shall use the terms long - lasting and specific immune response interchangeably , likewise for transient and cross - reactive .",
    "the above system can be formalized with the help of an adjacency matrix @xmath13 , whose entries @xmath14 are equal to one if the variants @xmath0 and @xmath15 share some of their minor epitopes and equal to zero otherwise . obviously , the matrix @xmath13 is always a symmetric matrix .",
    "prior to constructing this matrix it is important to introduce a certain ordering of the variants according to their epitopes . to illustrate this ,",
    "suppose we have a system of two minor epitopes with two variants in the each epitope . in this case , the total number of variants is four , and they are enumerated as follows @xmath16 the diagramme of interactions between these antigenic variants is shown in fig .  [ vard ] .",
    "it is clear that for a system of @xmath17 minor epitopes with @xmath18 variants in each epitope , the total number of variants is given by @xmath19    after the ordering of variants has been fixed , it is straightforward to construct the connectivity matrix @xmath13 of variant interactions . for the particular system of variants ( [ var4 ] ) , this matrix has the form @xmath20 for the rest of the paper we will concentrate on the case of two minor epitopes , but the results can be generalized to larger systems of antigenic variants . using the connectivity matrix",
    "one can rewrite the system ( [ yeq])-([weq ] ) in a vector form @xmath21 where @xmath22 etc .",
    ", @xmath23 denotes a vector of the length @xmath24 with all components equal to one , and in the right - hand side of the first equation multiplication is taken to be entry - wise so that the output is a vector again .",

    "we will assume that cross - reactive immune responses develop at a slower rate than specific immune responses , have a shorter life time , and are less efficient in destroying the infection .",
    "this implies the following relations between the system parameters @xmath35    in terms of symmetry in the network of interactions between different antigenic variants , in the case of two minor epitopes with @xmath17 variants in the first epitope and @xmath36 variants in the second , the system ( [ vs ] ) is equivariant with respect to the following symmetry group @xcite @xmath37 here , @xmath38 denotes the symmetric group of all permutations in a network of @xmath36 nodes with an all - to - all coupling , and @xmath39 is the cyclic group of order 2 , which corresponds to rotations by @xmath40 .",
    "the above construction can be generalized in a straightforward way to a larger number of minor epitopes .",
    "system ( [ vs ] ) provides an interesting example of a linear coupling , which for @xmath41 does not reduce to known symmetric configurations , such as diffusive , star or all - to - all coupling @xcite .",
    "a really important aspect is that two systems of antigenic variants with the same total number of variants @xmath24 may have different symmetry properties as described by the symmetry group @xmath42 depending on @xmath17 and @xmath36 , such that @xmath43 .",
    "in the particular case of non - decaying specific immune response @xmath44 and instantaneous immune response ( @xmath45 ) , steady states of the system ( [ vs ] ) are not isolated but rather form an @xmath24-dimensional hypersurface @xmath46 in the phase space @xcite .",
    "linearization near each equilibrium on this hypersurface has the eigenvalues @xmath47 of multiplicity @xmath24 , zero of multiplicity @xmath24 , and the the rest of the spectrum is given by @xmath48 this suggests that the hypersurface consists of saddles and stable nodes , and besides the original symmetry of the system it possesses an additional translational symmetry along the @xmath49 axes .",
    "furthermore , stability of equilibria on the hypersurface does not depend on the time delay @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of this hypersurface of equilibria in the phase space leads to a particular behaviour of phase trajectories , which mimics the occurrence of sequential parasitimea peaks in the immune dynamics of malaria @xcite .    when @xmath50 , the structure of the phase space of the system ( [ vs ] ) and its steady states is drastically different .",
    "now , the only symmetry present is the original symmetry @xmath42 , and the hypersurface of equilibria @xmath51 disintegrates into just two distinct points : the origin @xmath52 , which is always a saddle , and the fully symmetric equilibrium @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the total number of connections for each variant , which in the case of two minor epitopes with @xmath17 variants in the first epitope and @xmath36 variants in the second , is equal to @xmath55 .",
    "it has been previously shown that in the absence of time delay , the fully symmetric equilibrium @xmath56 can undergo hopf bifurcation as the system parameters are varied @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that if one assumes all variants to be exactly the same , the system collapses onto a system with just 3 dimensions , but in this case it is possible to show that the fully symmetric equilibrium is always stable for @xmath45 @xcite and can have a hopf bifurcation for @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "besides the origin and the fully symmetric steady state , system ( [ vs ] ) has @xmath58 other steady states , all of which are unstable @xcite .    in order to understand the structure of the solution that arises from the hopf bifurcation of the fully symmetric steady state @xmath56 , we concentrate on a specific connectivity matrix @xmath13 ( [ var4 ] ) corresponding to a particular example of a system of two epitopes with two variants in each epitope , as shown in fig .",

    "the periodic solution that appearing will be an even periodic orbit , which has the full original symmetry @xmath87 and is characterized by all variants oscillating in perfect synchrony with each other .",

    "_ + figure  [ ldfig ] illustrates how the time delay affects possible types of bifurcating solutions .",
    "similar to the case of small time delay , the steady state @xmath56 bifurcates primarily into an even periodic orbit for smaller values of @xmath117 and into an odd periodic orbit for higher values of @xmath117 .",
    "the main difference from the case of small time delay is that now the range of admissible values @xmath4 is bounded by @xmath3 rather than the value of @xmath114 at the hopf bifurcation for @xmath45 .",
    "there are two main conclusions to be drawn from this figure .",
    "the first one is that the computations of @xmath158 suggest that the state @xmath56 can only bifurcate to either even or odd periodic orbit , and the bifurcation into a subspace @xmath86 corresponding to two pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis simultaneously does not happen , thus excluding the occurrence of vertex or edge oscillations , as well as discrete travelling waves @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not preclude them from appearing in the dynamics altogether , as they can arise as solutions bifurcating from the even / odd periodic orbits , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "the second conclusion which follows from fig .",
    "[ ldfig ] is that as the efficiency of cross - reactive immune response @xmath4 increases , this leads to a decrease in @xmath158 , thus leading to the onset of sustained oscillations for faster immune responses .",
    "in the previous sections we established that the fully symmetric steady state @xmath56 can undergo hopf bifurcation , giving rise to two different types of solutions : a symmetric solution , in which all variants are oscillating identically , and an odd periodic orbit having variants 1 and 3 oscillating synchronously and half a period out - of - phase with variants 2 and 4 . to understand evolution of these solutions as the time delay increases ,",
    "we have performed a number of numerical simulations of system ( [ vs ] ) , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ tsols ] .",
    "one can observe that for sufficiently small immune delay , the fully symmetric steady state @xmath56 is stable , see fig .",
    "as the time delay @xmath7 exceeds its critical value ( [ tau0 ] ) at the hopf boundary , this state becomes unstable and gives rise to a stable fully symmetric periodic orbit , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "( b ) . as the time delay increases , this solution acquires subharmonics , as shown in fig .",
    "( c ) , and it eventually becomes chaotic , see fig .",
    "( d ) . for other values of parameters , the fully symmetric steady state @xmath56 bifurcates into an odd periodic solution ( see fig .",
    "( e ) ) , which for higher values of @xmath7 transforms into a discrete travelling wave , where each of the variants is quarter of period out - of - phase with its neighbours on the diagramme ( [ vard ] ) .",
    "in fact , as the time delay is varied , it is possible to observe other stable periodic solutions with different phase shifts between antigenic variants .",
    "the important difference from the model without time delay is that the only possibility for @xmath45 is a bifurcation into an odd periodic orbit @xcite , while for @xmath57 there is also a possibility of the steady state @xmath56 bifurcating to a stable fully symmetric periodic orbit . in this case , hopf bifurcation does not lead to the breakdown of the original @xmath87 symmetry .",
    "also , we note an important difference from the globally coupled system with delayed immune response . when considering a network of antigenic variants with an",
    "all - to - all coupling , carr and mitchell @xcite have shown that for the majority of parameter values , anti - phase hopf bifurcation eventually leads to the behaviour that appears chaotic , while the simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ tsols ] suggest that when not all antigenic variants are related to each other , the system is able to support a number of different out - of - phase solutions without going into chaotic regime .",
    "to better understand the structure of different types of periodic behaviour in the model , one can use the so - called @xmath160 theorem , which takes into account individual spatial and spatio - temporal    symmetries of the solutions @xcite . to use this method",
    ", we note that due to @xmath42-equivariance of the system ( [ vs ] ) and uniqueness of its solutions , it follows that for any @xmath13-periodic solutions @xmath161 and any element @xmath162 of the group , one can write @xmath163 for some phase shift @xmath164 . the pair @xmath165 is called a _ spatio - temporal symmetry _ of the solution @xmath161 , and the collection of all spatio - temporal symmetries of @xmath161 forms a subgroup @xmath166 .",
    "one can identify @xmath167 with a pair of subgroups , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , such that @xmath170 .",
    "we also define @xmath171 here , @xmath169 consists of the symmetries that fix @xmath161 at each point in time , while @xmath168 consists of the symmetries that fix the entire trajectory . under some generic assumptions on @xmath168 and @xmath169 ,",
    "the @xmath160 theorem states that periodic states have spatio - temporal symmetry group pairs @xmath172 only if @xmath160 is cyclic , and @xmath169 is an isotropy subgroup @xcite .",
    "the @xmath160 theorem was originally derived in the context of equivariant dynamical systems by buono and golubitsky @xcite , and it has subsequently been used to classify various types of periodic behaviours in systems with symmetry that arise in a number of contexts , from speciation @xcite to animal gaits @xcite and vestibular system of vertebrates @xcite . in the case of @xmath87 symmetry group acting on four elements , there are eleven pairs of subgroups @xmath168 and @xmath169 satisfying the above requirements @xcite . while periodic solutions corresponding to each such pair can exist in a general setup , the above theorem does not guarantee their existence or stability in a particular system , see discussion in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use numerical simulations shown in in fig .",
    "[ tsols ] to identify specific types of periodic solutions and their spatio - temporal symmetries that can be found in the system ( [ vs ] ) .",
    "solutions shown in figs .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) have the full original symmetry of the system , and therefore are characterized by a pair @xmath173 . the solution shown in fig .",
    "( d ) is chaotic and does not have any of the symmetries of the original system .",
    "figure ( e ) illustrates an odd periodic orbit with a symmetry @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is an isotropy subgroup associated with reflections along the diagonals of the square .",
    "finally , the solution shown in fig .",
    "( f ) is a discrete travelling wave with the symmetry @xmath176 , also known as a `` splay state '' @xcite , `` periodic travelling ( or rotating ) wave '' @xcite , or `` ponies on a merry - go - round '' or poms @xcite in the studies of systems of coupled oscillators . in this dynamical regime",
    "all variants appear sequentially one after another along the diagramme in fig .",
    "( [ vard ] ) with quarter of a period difference between two neighbouring variants . from the perspective of equvariant bifurcation theory ,",
    "this solution is generic since the group @xmath177 is always one of the subgroups of the @xmath178 group for the ring coupling , or the @xmath179 group for an all - to - all coupling , and its existence has already been extensively studied @xcite . from the immunological point of view",
    ", this is an extremely important observation that effectively such solution , which immunologically represents sequential appearance of parasitemia peaks corresponding to different antigenic variants , owes its existence not to the individual dynamics of antigenic variants , but rather to the particular symmetric nature of cross - reactive interactions between them .",
    "this immunological genericity ensures that the same conclusions hold for a wide variety of immune interactions between human host and parasites , which use antigenic variation as a mechanism of immune escape , as illustrated , for instance , by malaria , african trypanosomes , several members of _ neisseria _ family ( _ n . meningitidis _ and _ n. gonorrhoeae _ ) , _ borrelia hermsii _ etc .",
    "in this paper we have used methods of equivariant bifurcation theory to understand the effects of immune delay on the dynamics in a model of antigenic variation in malaria . in the simplest case of two epitopes with two variants in each epitope ,",
    "the system is equivariant with respect to a @xmath87 symmetry group of the square . using isotypic decomposition of the phase space based on the irreducible representations of this symmetry group has allowed us to find critical value of the time delay at the boundary of hopf bifurcation of the fully symmetric steady state in terms of system parameters .",
    "we have identified even and odd periodic solutions that can arise at hopf bifurcation , and also performed numerical simulations of the full system to illustrate other types of dynamical behaviours that can be exhibited by the model .",
    "these have been classified in terms of their spatial and spatio - temporal symmetries using the @xmath160 theorem .",
    "our analysis suggests that as the efficiency of the cross - reactive immune response increases , the critical value of the time delay at the hopf bifurcation decreases , which is similar to earlier studied cases of complete synchrony @xcite or global coupling between antigenic variants @xcite . at the same time , unlike these , out system is able to support a range of stable phase shift solutions without developing chaotic dynamics .",
    "when applying the results of our analysis to the studies of realistic models of antigenic variation , one of the important consideration that have to be taken into account is the fact that in reality systems of antigenic variants do not always fully preserve the symmetry assumed in the mathematical models . in the context of modelling immune interactions between distinct antigenic variants",
    ", this means that not all variants cross - react with each other in exactly the same quantitative manner . despite this limitation , due to the normal hyperbolicity , which is a generic property in such models , main phenomena associated with the symmetric model",
    "survive under perturbations , including symmetry - breaking perturbations .",
    "the discussion of this issue in the context of modelling sympatric speciation using a symmetric model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper are quite generic , and the conclusions we obtained are valid for a wide range of mathematical models of antigenic variation .",
    "in fact , they are applicable to the analysis of within - host dynamics of any parasite , which exhibits similar qualitative features of immune interactions based on the degree of relatedness between its antigenic variants .",
    "the significance of this lies in the possibility to classify expected dynamical regimes of behaviour using very generic assumption regarding immune interactions , and they will still hold true , provided the actual system preserves the underlying symmetries .",
    "there are several ways in which the analysis in this paper can be further improved to achieve an even more realistic representation of the dynamics of antigenic variation .",
    "one of the assumptions in our analysis is that that the degree of cross - reactivity between antigenic variants does not vary with the number of epitopes they share .",
    "it is straightforward , however , to introduce antigenic distance between antigenic variants in a manner similar to the hamming distance @xcite .",
    "such a modification would not alter the topology of the network of immune interactions , but rather it would assign different weights to connections between different antigenic variants in such a network .",
    "another modelling issue concerns the way how the time delay in the immune response can be represented mathematically in the most realistic manner . it would be beneficial to investigate the dynamics of antigenic variation under the influence of a more general distributed time delay , which is known to cause both destabilization of steady states , and also suppression of oscillations @xcite",
    "this would provide better insights into how the efficiency of developing and maintaining immune response affects the within - host dynamics of parasites with antigenic variation .",
    "alternatively , one can introduce different time delays for the development of specific and long - lasting immune responses and analyse how the difference in these timescales affects the overall stability and dynamics .",
    "systematic analysis of the effects of the introduction of antigenic distances and different / distributed delays in the immune response on the dynamics of antigenic variation is the subject of further study .",
