    "plane domains with piecewise - smooth boundary curves occur in applications to electronics circuit design , airfoil modelling in computational fluid dynamics , computer vision and various other problems of engineering and science @xcite .",
    "we assume that the domain is bounded and that there are either one or two simple ( and nonintersecting ) boundary curves .",
    "the domain is then either simply or doubly connected . for the mathematical modelling of these domains",
    "it is usually convenient to map the domains conformally onto `` canonical domains '' as simple as possible : the unit disk @xmath1 or the annulus @xmath2 sometimes a rectangle is preferable to the unit disk as a canonical domain .",
    "the existence of these canonical conformal mappings is guaranteed by classical results of geometric function theory but the construction of this mapping in a concrete application case is usually impossible .",
    "therefore one has to resort to numerical conformal mapping methods for which there exists an extensive literature @xcite .",
    "the schwarz - christoffel ( sc ) toolbox of driscoll @xcite , based on the software of trefethen @xcite , is in wide use for numerical conformal mapping applications .    in the doubly connected case",
    ", one might be interested in only knowing the inner radius @xmath3 of the canonical annulus .",
    "for instance this occurs if we wish to compute the electric resistance of a ring condenser .",
    "in this situation the conformal mapping itself is not needed if we are able to find the inner radius @xmath3 by some other method .",
    "it is a classical fact that the inner radius @xmath3 can be obtained in terms of the solution of the dirichlt problem for the laplace equation in the original domain with the boundary value @xmath4 on one boundary component and the boundary value @xmath5 on the other one .",
    "this fact is just one way of saying that the modulus of a ring domain is conformally invariant : for the canonical annulus @xmath6 the modulus is equal to @xmath7 this idea reduces the problem of computing the number @xmath3 to the problem of numerical approximation of the solutions of laplace equation in ring domains . in the paper @xcite",
    "this method was applied to several concrete examples of ring domains for which numerical results were reported , too .",
    "again , it is also possible to use the schwarz - christoffel method for doubly connected domains @xcite .",
    "we next consider the case of simply connected plane domains .",
    "for such a domain @xmath8 and for a quadruple @xmath9 of its boundary points we call @xmath10 a quadrilateral if @xmath11 occur in this order when the boundary curve is traversed in the positive direction .",
    "the points @xmath12 are called the vertices and the part of the oriented boundary between two successive vertices such as @xmath13 and @xmath14 is called a boundary arc @xmath15 the modulus @xmath16 of the quadrilateral @xmath10 is defined to be the unique @xmath17 for which there exists a conformal mapping of @xmath8 onto the rectangle with vertices @xmath18 such that the points @xmath19 correspond to the vertices in this order .",
    "this conformal mapping is called the canonical conformal mapping associated with the quadrilateral . as in the case of doubly connected domains discussed above , it is well - known that the computation of the modulus @xmath20 of the quadrilateral may be reduced to solving the dirichlt - neumann boundary value problem in the original domain @xmath8 with the dirichlt boundary values @xmath5 on the boundary arc @xmath21 and @xmath4 on the arc @xmath22 and neumann boundary values @xmath4 on the arcs @xmath22 and @xmath23    conformal moduli of rings and quadrilaterals have independent theoretical interest because of their crucial role in the theory of quasiconformal mappings @xcite .",
    "these quantities are closely related to certain physical constants , e.g. they play an important role in applications involving the measurement of resistance values of integrated circuit networks . but",
    "the problem of computing the moduli is also interesting in the wider engineering context . the reciprocal identities ( [ recipridty ] ) and ( [ myidty ] ) can be used to generate test cases for curvilinear lipschitz domains and thus should be standard tools in the fem - software development community .",
    "unfortunately these identities are missing from the introductory fem textbooks .",
    "although the experimental results in this paper show that the reciprocal identities provide error estimates similar to the true error ( in cases where the exact analytic result is known ) more investigations are needed to properly study their applicability in other contexts . even though our interest lies in the high - order methods , these test cases are equally valid for any numerical pde methods and mesh adaptation in particular .",
    "one specific application area of the algorithms presented here is the simulation of measurements for the 2d electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) @xcite . in eit problems a number of electrodes",
    "are placed on the boundary of the domain and current patterns are considered between every pair of them .",
    "indeed , computing the moduli can be considered as a very crude model for the so - called eit background forward problem . in general , the meshes for the eit forward problems can be adapted using the approaches outlined below .",
    "high level of accuracy is necessary for precise control of artificial noise in the simulations .    a general observation about the literature seems to be that reported numerical values of the moduli of concrete quadrilaterals ( or ring domains ) are hard to find .",
    "perhaps the longest list of numerical results is given in @xcite where pointers to earlier literature may be found .",
    "the recent book @xcite lists also many such numerical values . in our opinion",
    "a catalogue of these numerical values in the simplest cases would be desirable for instance for reference purposes .",
    "the book @xcite and the paper @xcite list certain engineering formulas which have been applied in vlsi circuit design .",
    "an outline of the structure of this paper now follows .",
    "first , in section 2 we describe the methods used in this paper . in section 3",
    "we discuss in detail the various fem methods used here , in particular the @xmath0-method which was implemented and applied to generate some of the results reported below .",
    "another method we use is the @xmath20-adaptive software package afem of k. samuelsson , which implements an adaptive fem method and which was previously used in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we use the afem method to compute the modulus of a quadrilateral whereas in @xcite it was used merely for the computation of the moduli of ring domains . in section 4 a test problem for quadrilaterals is described together with its analytic solution , following @xcite .",
    "this analytic solution requires , however , an application of a numerical root finding program . accordingly , this formula is analytic - numeric in its character . in section 5",
    "we check several methods against this analytic formula in a test involving a family of convex quadrilaterals .",
    "the methods discussed are the analytic formula from @xcite , the schwarz - christoffel toolbox of @xcite , the afem method of samuelsson @xcite and the present @xmath0-method . on the basis of these experiments , an accuracy ranking of the methods",
    "is given in section 5 . in section 6 the more general case of polygonal quadrilaterals is investigated , in particular l - shaped domains , and the results are compared to the literature . in section 7",
    "we discuss the computation of the modulus of a ring domain in a few special cases .",
    "for instance , for `` the cross in square '' ring domain considered previously in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 4 ) we now obtain much improved accuracy . in section 8 we compute some examples with the @xmath0-fem which are difficult for other methods . in section 9 our results and discoveries are summarized .",
    "the following problem is known as the _ dirichlt - neumann problem_. let @xmath8 be a region in the complex plane whose boundary @xmath24 consists of a finite number of regular jordan curves , so that at every point , except possibly at finitely many points , of the boundary a normal is defined .",
    "let @xmath25 where @xmath26 both are unions of jordan arcs .",
    "let @xmath27 be a real - valued continuous functions defined on @xmath28 , respectively . find a function @xmath29 satisfying the following conditions :    @xmath29 is continuous and differentiable in @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 denotes differentiation in the direction of the exterior normal , then @xmath33      one can express the modulus of a quadrilateral @xmath34 in terms of the solution of the dirichlt - neumann problem as follows .",
    "let @xmath35 be the arcs of @xmath24 between @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 respectively .",
    "if @xmath29 is the ( unique ) harmonic solution of the dirichlt - neumann problem with boundary values of @xmath29 equal to @xmath4 on @xmath40 , equal to @xmath5 on @xmath41 and with @xmath42 on @xmath43 then by ( * ? ?",
    "* /thm 4.5 ) : @xmath44      let @xmath45 and @xmath46 be two disjoint compact sets in the extended complex plane @xmath47 .",
    "then one of the sets @xmath48 @xmath46 is bounded and without loss of generality we may assume that it is @xmath49 if both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are connected and the set @xmath50 is connected , then @xmath51 is called a _ ring domain_. in this case @xmath51 is a doubly connected plane domain .",
    "the _ capacity _ of @xmath51 is defined by @xmath52 where the infimum is taken over all nonnegative , piecewise differentiable functions @xmath29 with compact support in @xmath53 such that @xmath54 on @xmath45 .",
    "it is well - known that the harmonic function on @xmath51 with boundary values @xmath5 on @xmath45 and @xmath4 on @xmath46 is the unique function that minimizes the above integral . in other words ,",
    "the minimizer may be found by solving the dirichlt problem for the laplace equation in @xmath51 with boundary values @xmath5 on the bounded boundary component @xmath45 and @xmath4 on the other boundary component @xmath55 a ring domain @xmath51 can be mapped conformally onto the annulus @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the _ conformal modulus _ of the ring domain @xmath58 the modulus and capacity of a ring domain are connected by the simple identity @xmath59 . for more information on the modulus of a ring domain and its applications in complex analysis the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .      for the computation of the modulus of a quadrilateral or of a ring domain",
    "there are two natural approaches    methods based on the definition of the modulus and on the use of a conformal mapping onto a canonical rectangle or annulus ,    methods that give only the modulus , not the canonical conformal map .    in some sense , methods of class ( i ) give a lot of extra information , namely the conformal mapping ",
    "all we want is a single real number",
    ". methods of class ( ii ) rely on solving the dirichlt - neumann boundary value problem or dirichlt problem for the laplace equation as described above",
    ".    in this paper we will mainly use methods of type ( ii ) that make use of adaptive fem methods for solving the laplace equation .      with the exception of a few special cases , both of the above methods lead to extensive numerical computation . for both classes of methods",
    "there are several options in the literature , see for instance the bibliography of @xcite .",
    "various aspects of the theory and practice of numerical conformal mapping are reviewed in the monographs @xcite .",
    "see also the authoritative surveys @xcite .",
    "recently numerical conformal mappings have been studied from various points of view and in various applications by many authors , see e.g. @xcite . in (",
    "* chapter 3 ) n.  papamichael and n.  stylianopoulos describe the so - called domain decomposition method for the computation of the modulus of a quadrilateral which is designed for the case of elongated quadrilaterals and applies e.g. to polygonal quadrilaterals that can be decomposed into simple pieces whose moduli can be estimated . as an example they consider a spiraling quadrilateral that can be decomposed into a `` sum '' of @xmath60 trapezoids and report results that are expected to be correct up to @xmath61 decimal places .",
    "therefore , this method seems very attractive for the computation of the modulus of a special class of quadrilaterals .",
    "a key feature of the method is that it reduces the numerical difficulties caused by the crowding phenomenon for this special class of quadrilaterals .",
    "in the paper @xcite the modulus of a ring domain was computed with the help of the software package afem of k.  samuelsson , based on an @xmath20-adaptive finite element method .",
    "it can be easily applied to compute the modulus of a quadrilateral .    in this section",
    "we describe the high - order @xmath62- , and @xmath0-finite element methods .",
    "the paper of babuka and suri @xcite gives an accessible overview of the method . for a more detailed exposition",
    "we refer to schwab @xcite , and for those familiar with engineering approach the book by szabo and babuka @xcite is recommended . for the applications considered in this paper ,",
    "any finite element computation requires at least the choice of the following .",
    "initial discretization of the domain . in 2d",
    "each discretization or mesh divides the domain into elements , plane regions with piecewise smooth boundaries .",
    "these are usually either triangles or quadrilaterals .    refinement strategy .",
    "the choice of the refinement strategy is connected to choosing the finite element method ( fem ) : mesh refinement ( @xmath20-method ) , elementwise polynomial order ( @xmath62-method ) , or both above ( @xmath0-method ) .",
    "the unknowns or degrees of freedom are the coefficients of the chosen shape functions . in the @xmath20-version",
    "the shape functions are such that the coefficients are also values of the solution at specified locations of the discretization of the computational domain , that is , the nodes of the mesh . in the @xmath62-method ,",
    "the shape functions are polynomials that are associated with topological entities of the elements , nodes , sides , and interior .",
    "thus , in addition to increasing accuracy through refining the mesh , we have an additional refinement parameter , the polynomial degree @xmath62 .",
    "both choices will have an influence on the performance and the accuracy attained with the chosen method .",
    "the mutual influence of these choices is hard to analyze theoretically but usually it may be seen in the results .",
    "for instance , we have observed that the choice of the intitial mesh and the mesh refinement strategy may limit the accuracy achieved by the @xmath0-method and therefore it is useful to try a few initial meshes .",
    "let us next define a @xmath62-type quadrilateral element .",
    "the construction of triangles is similar and can be found from the references given above .",
    "many different selections of shape functions are possible .",
    "we follow szabo and babuka @xcite and present the so - called hierarchic shape functions .    legendre polynomials of degree @xmath63 can be defined using a recursion formula @xmath64 the derivatives can similarly be computed using a recursion @xmath65    for our purposes the central polynomials are the integrated legendre polynomials for @xmath66 $ ] @xmath67 which can be rewritten as linear combinations of legendre polynomials @xmath68 the normalizing coefficients are chosen so that @xmath69    we can now define the shape functions for a quadrilateral reference element over the domain @xmath70\\times[-1,1]$ ] .",
    "the shape functions are divided into three categories : nodal shape functions , side modes , and internal modes .",
    "there are four nodal shape functions : @xmath71 taken alone , these shapes define the standard four - node quadrilateral finite element .",
    "there are @xmath72 side modes associated with the sides of a quadrilateral @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74      for the internal modes we have two options .",
    "the so - called trunk space has @xmath75 shapes @xmath76 whereas the full space has @xmath77 shapes @xmath78 in this paper we always use the full space .",
    "the internal shape functions are often referred to as bubble - functions .",
    "the legendre polynomials have the property @xmath79 . in 2d all internal edges of the mesh",
    "are shared by two different elements .",
    "we must ensure that each edge has the same global parameterization in both elements .",
    "this additional book - keeping is not necessary in the standard @xmath20-fem .",
    "we have seen that the number of unknowns in a @xmath62-type quadrilateral is @xmath80 or @xmath81 if the internal modes are from trunk or full space , respectively . to compensate this , the number of elements is naturally taken to be as small as possible .",
    "indeed , when the mesh is adapted in a suitable way , the dimension of the overall linear system can be significantly lower than in the corresponding @xmath20-method .",
    "however , the matrices tend to be denser in the @xmath62-method , so the space requirements in relation to the dimension of the linear system are greater for the @xmath62-method .      for a certain class of problems",
    "it can be shown that if the mesh and the elemental degrees have been set optimally , we can obtain _ exponential convergence_. a geometric mesh is such that each successive layer of elements changes in size with some _ geometric scaling factor _ @xmath82 , toward some point of interest . in this case , the points of interest are always corner points .",
    "the following theorem is due to babuka and guo @xcite .",
    "note that construction of appropriate spaces is technical .",
    "for rigorous treatment of the theory involved see schwab @xcite , babuka and guo @xcite and references therein .",

    "the result also holds for constant polynomial degree distribution .",
    "let us denote the number of the highest layer with @xmath90 , _ the nesting level_. using this notation we can refer to geometric meshes as @xmath91-meshes .    in figure [ geometricmeshfig ]",
    "we show a geometric mesh template for a non - convex quadrilateral . here",
    "we require that each node lies at the end point of an edge and that the meshlines follow the guidelines of the geometric meshes .        in figure [ propermeshseqfig ] a sequence of graded meshes",
    "is shown . in the middle and",

    "we use the following two - phase algorithm :    generate a minimal mesh ( triangulation ) where the corners are isolated with a fixed number of triangles depending on the interior angle , @xmath93 so that the refinements can be carried out independently :    @xmath94 : one triangle ,    @xmath95 : two triangles , and    @xmath96 : three triangles .    every triangle attached to a corner",
    "is replaced by a refinement , where the edges incident to the corner are split as specified by the scaling factor @xmath82 .",
    "this process is repeated recursively until the desired nesting level @xmath90 is reached .",
    "note that the mesh may include quadrilaterals after refinement .",

    "only first two levels are visible . ]    in figure [ propermeshseqfig ] we can also see our preferred element subdivisions : triangle to ( quadrilateral , triangle)-pair , and quadrilateral to three quadrilaterals .",

    "denote the number of elements in the initial mesh , and @xmath87 the number of corners in the domain ( or those used in refining ) : @xmath98 where the constant 6 is the product of the maximal number of elements surrounding a corner , 3 , and the maximal number of new elements per level , 2 .",
    "finally , in figure [ generatedmeshesfig ] three minimal meshes and in figure [ generatedgradedmeshesfig ] one final mesh are shown .",
    "since we want to use as large elements as possible , it is important to represent curved boundary segments accurately .",
    "the linear blending function method of gordon and hall @xcite is our choice for this purpose .    in the general case",
    "all sides of an element can be curved as in figure  [ curvedboundary ] .",
    "we assume that every side is parameterized : @xmath99 using capital letters as coordinates of the corner points , @xmath100 , we can write the mapping for the global @xmath101-coordinates of a quadrilateral as @xmath102 and symmetrically for the @xmath103-coordinate . note , that if the side parameterizations represent straight edges , the mapping simplifies to the standard bilinear mapping of quadrilaterals .    in the following we always use exact representation of the geometry which implies that in the ensuing mesh grading process no approximation of geometry is necessary",
    "here the mesh generation of the curved domains is template - based , thus the changes in curvature are not automatically dealt with . for a highly accessible review of the @xmath62-method mesh generation issues we refer to @xcite .",
    "in this section our goal is to introduce a test problem , whose solution is determined by a transcendental equation .",
    "this equation can be numerically solved to the desired accuracy and we will use this to check the validity of the numerical methods we use as well as to obtain an experimental estimate for their accuracy .",
    "the test problems we consider are convex polygonal quadrilaterals .",
    "the simplest such quadrilateral consists of the four vertices and the line segments joining the vertices .",
    "let @xmath104 be distinct points and suppose that the polygonal line that results from connecting these points by segments in the order @xmath105 forms the positively oriented boundary of a domain @xmath106 . for simplicity ,",
    "we denote by @xmath107 the modulus @xmath108 .",
    "then the modulus is a conformal invariant in the following sense : if @xmath109 is a conformal mapping onto a jordan domain @xmath110 then @xmath111 has a homeomorphic extension to the closure @xmath112 ( also denoted by @xmath111 ) and @xmath113 it is clear by geometry that the following reciprocal identity holds : @xmath114 there are two particular cases , where we can immediately give @xmath115 the first case occurs , when all the sides are of equal length ( i.e. the quadrilateral is a rhombus ) and in this case the modulus is @xmath116 see @xcite . in the second case",

    "it seems that such a large class of examples has previously not been known for instance in the fem community",
    ". these examples also enable one to experimentally demonstrate the theoretical convergence rates in nontrivial model problem cases as we have shown for the case of @xmath0-fem .",
    "for the very special case of convex polygons with four sides , the modulus of the corresponding quadrilateral is known as an analytic - numeric formula ( [ hvvmodu ] ) by @xcite and this is our starting point .",
    "we compare the performance of sc toolbox , afem , and @xmath0-fem against the formula @xcite and the reciprocal identity test .",
    "next , again using sc toolbox , afem , and @xmath0-fem , we consider polygonal quadrilaterals with more sides , l - shaped quadrilaterals and carry out similar comparision , using again the reciprocal identity as the test quantity .",
    "thereafter , we discuss , now using afem , and @xmath0-fem , two classical cases of ring domains , the square frame and the cross in square ring domains previously considered e.g. in @xcite where further references may be found . the error estimate in the square frame case",
    "is based on the well - known formula ( [ sqframe ] ) whereas for the cross in square case we use sc toolbox and the results from @xcite as the comparision data .",
    "finally , we also consider several cases of quadrilaterals with curvilinear boundaries , now only using the @xmath0-fem method , because the other methods mentioned above do not apply .",
