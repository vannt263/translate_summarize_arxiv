    "this timescale coincides with that in model iii , in which the initial plasma @xmath114 is 100 .",
    "the direction of azimuthal magnetic field in the coronal region is opposite to that of the equatorial region .      in order to study the dependence of numerical results on the size of the azimuthal simulation region and mesh sizes in the azimuthal direction",

    "( figure [ fig : f20]_b _ ) , however , the magnetic energy in model vii decreases and becomes smaller than that in model iii .",
    "these results are consistent with the results of local 3d mhd simulations of accretion disks @xcite , in which they showed that the nonlinear saturation level of the magnetic energy increases with the size of the simulation region .    when the azimuthal size of the simulation region is fixed ( model v , vi and vii ) , the saturation level of the magnetic energy ( @xmath197 ) is larger in the high resolution model ( model v ) than that in low resolution models ( model vi and vii ) .",
    "this result is also consistent with the results of local 3d mhd simulations of the growth of mri in accretion disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the time evolution of the magnetic energy before its saturation ( figure [ fig : f20]_a _ ) depends on how the gas infalls and carries in magnetic fields .",
    "the earlier rise of magnetic energy in the highest resolution model ( model v ) is due to the faster growth of the mri in the torus .",
    "the growth rate of the mri is sensitive to the azimuthal grid resolution because the most unstable wavenumber @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is the wavenumber parallel to the unperturbed magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is hardly resolved in low resolution simulations . when @xmath200 , the most unstable wavelength is @xmath201 where @xmath185 is the disk half thickness .",
    "thus , @xmath202",
    ". we need at least 120 mesh points in @xmath203 when one wavelength is resolved by 4 mesh points .",
    "thus , in all models we adopted in this paper , the fastest growing mode is not numerically resolved .",
    "these estimates indicate that the growth rate of mri is affected by the grid size and that the growth rate in models iii , vi and vii at @xmath204 are smaller than that in model v. therefore , the infall of the torus gas is delayed in low - resolution models .",
    "let us discuss why magnetic energy in low resolution models ( model iii and vii ) is larger than that in high resolution models ( model v and vi ) in the nonlinear stage before the saturation ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "these magnetic fields are carried into @xmath196 with the gas infalling along the channels of magnetic fields .",
    "since non - axisymmetric parasitic instabilities @xcite and magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which break up the channel flow can be captured better in high resolution simulations , the growth rate of the magnetic energy becomes smaller in high resolution models than that in low resolution models .",

    "the azimuthal magnetic flux buoyantly rises into the corona and forms extended magnetized region .",
    "numerical results indicate that the magnetic flux rises faster into the corona in the high resolution model ( model v ) than low resolution models ( model vi and vii ) .",
    "high resolution simulations could resolve the most unstable wavelength of the parker instability , @xmath207 in our simulation model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thus , one wavelength of the parker unstable loop is well resolved in high resolution model with 64 grid points in @xmath194 at @xmath134 ( model v ) but hardly resolved in the low resolution model ( model vii ) .",
    "this may be the reason why toroidal magnetic flux rises faster in model v than in other models ( figure [ fig : f21]_b _ ) .    when the azimuthal resolution is fixed ( model iii and vii ) , the magnetic flux rises faster in the model with larger azimuthal simulation region ( model iii ) .",
    "this dependence on the azimuthal simulation region comes from the horizontal expansion of the rising magnetic loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the flat rotation curve is similar to the rotation curve in the outer part of external spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our numerical result reproduces these flat rotation curves when we use the gravitational potential which includes the dark matter .    since the rotation curve of our galaxy distant from the galactic center",
    "is obtained by radio observations of hi gas , the observationally measured rotation curve is that for the gas . the rotation curve of the neutral hydrogen does not necessarily coincide with that of stars and the dark matter .",
    "since they are almost frozen to the magnetic fields , if the magnetic arm rotates with angular speed different from the dark matter , the neutral hydrogen is not a good tracer of mass distribution in our galaxy .",
    "@xcite suggested that when magnetic pinch force is large enough , they can explain the observed rotation curve of the galaxy without dark matter . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite reported that the contribution of the magnetic field to the rotation curve is up to 20 km / s and it is not sufficient to banish the effect of dark matter .",
    "our numerical results indicate that even in the presence of dynamically non - negligible magnetic fields , gas component shows a flat rotation curve similar to that observed by neutral hydrogen .",
    "numerical results for model i indicates that if the dark matter does not exist , gas rotation curve decreases with radius . thus , the flat rotation curve obtained by observations of neutral hydrogen really indicates the existence of dark matter .",
    "we carried out global three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of galactic gaseous disks to investigate how the galactic magnetic fields are amplified and maintained .",
    "we showed the dependence of numerical results on physical conditions in the innermost region , gravitational potential , and strength of initial magnetic fields .    in all models ,",
    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) grows in the disk and the magnetic energy is amplified and maintained for more than @xmath212 .",
    "the saturation level of magnetic fields , however , is smaller than that expected from observations ( @xmath213 several @xmath214 ) at @xmath134 .",
    "the multiphase nature of interstellar space , supernova explosions , cosmic rays and/or non - axisymmetric spiral potential may be important to further amplify magnetic fields .",
    "numerical results indicate that mean azimuthal field inside the galactic disk is amplified and that its direction changes quasi - periodically .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation of the azimuthal field increases with time .",
    "the interval of reversal of equatorial azimuthal field is @xmath215 .",
    "this timescale is comparable to the timescale of the buoyant rise of azimuthal magnetic flux from the disk to the corona .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuating field is comparable to the mean magnetic field .",
    "the strength of the mean field only weakly depends on the initial strength of magnetic fields . in the coronal region ,",
    "the mean azimuthal field has direction opposite to the mean field of the disk .",
    "mean magnetic fields obtained from numerical simulations also show reversals in the radial direction near the equatorial plane around @xmath216 at @xmath132 .",
    "the radius of the field reversal changes with time because the spiral magnetic channels which produce the reversal of azimuthal fields in the radial direction move inward as the disk gas accretes toward the galactic center .    in the galactic plane , magnetic field reversals are observed by rotation measure ( rms ) of pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the reversals of mean magnetic fields are observed in our galaxy between the local orion arm and the inner sagittarius arm @xcite .",
    "more recent analysis imply axisymmetric field with two reversals ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "simulation results of model iii ( figure [ fig : f13 ] ) show reversals of mean magnetic fields near the equatorial plane around @xmath216 .",
    "note that rms measure the mean magnetic field in some specific direction from the earth .",
    "when we draw lines from a point in figure [ fig : f13 ] , we can see field reversals in several directions .",
    "since the magnetic fields inside the galactic disk is turbulent , more and more field reversals will be observed as angular resolution of rms increase .    in conventional theories of @xmath217-dynamos",
    ", various kinds of spatial and temporal oscillations appear depending on the dynamo number @xmath218 where @xmath219 ( @xmath185 is the thickness of the disk , @xmath220 is the rotation angular speed and @xmath11 is the magnetic diffusivity ) and @xmath221 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our global mhd simulations",
    ", we do not need to introduce the dynamo @xmath12 parameter .",
    "the amplification of magnetic fields due to mri and the reproduction of toroidal fields through gas motions are self - consistently incorporated in our simulations .",
    "we introduced anomalous resistivity @xmath11 to handle magnetic reconnection which takes place in local region where current sheets are formed , but the turbulent diffusivity is not explicitly assumed .",
    "we showed by direct 3d simulations that mean toroidal magnetic fields show reversals both in space and time .",
    "@xcite constructed phenomenological models of disk dynamos by taking into account the growth of magnetic fields due to mri , escape of magnetic flux by the parker instability , and the dissipation of magnetic fields by magnetic reconnection .",
    "they showed that the magnetic fields in the disk oscillate quasi - periodically with period comparable to the time scale of the buoyant escape of the magnetic flux .",
    "this timescale is consistent with the timescale of field reversals obtained from our mhd simulations .",
    "let us discuss the similarities and dissimilarities of the magnetic activity of galactic gas disks produced by our numerical simulations and those in the sun .",
    "both objects are differentially rotating plasma with high conductivity in which magnetic fields are almost frozen to the rotating plasma .",
    "thus the magnetic fields can be deformed and amplified by the plasma motion .",
    "the sun is a slow rotator in which the centrifugal force is much smaller than the gravity , thus its atmosphere is confined by the gravity .",
    "the convective motions and/or the differential rotation in the convection region may be the source of magnetic field amplification in the sun .",
    "however , since the magnetic flux tube in the convection region buoyantly rises with a timescale of the order of a month ( e. g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , much shorter than the solar magnetic cycle ( @xmath222 ) , solar dynamo activity is considered to be operating in the interface between the convection zone and the radiative zone , where magnetic buoyancy is small and differential rotation exists ( e. g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , galactic gas disks are supported by the rotation and subject to differential rotation , which induces the growth of mri in the whole disk . in galactic gas disks , since the gas disk is convectively stable , the buoyant escape of the magnetic flux takes place with timescale @xmath223 .",
    "this timescale is longer than the growth time of mri @xmath224 .",
    "thus the magnetic fields can be amplified in the disk before escaping to the corona .",
    "numerical results indicate that the total azimuthal magnetic flux is nearly conserved . when turbulent diffusivity exists , the azimuthal magnetic flux is not necessarily conserved . in our simulations , however , since magnetic diffusion only exists in the local current sheet , the magnetic flux is almost conserved .",
    "we found that the toroidal magnetic flux in the disk buoyantly rises into the corona .",
    "this result indicates that the buoyant escape of the magnetic flux from the disk enables the amplification of mean magnetic fields in the galactic gas disk . when the magnetic diffusion is not negligible , the total azimuthal magnetic flux is not conserved but the magnetic helicity is conserved .",
    "@xcite pointed out the importance of helicity conservation and the role of coronal mass ejections , which help sustaining the solar dynamo cycle . in our simulations , buoyantly rising magnetic loops carry helicity as well as the magnetic flux threading the disk .",
    "this escape of magnetic flux and helicity enable the disk to amplify the azimuthal magnetic flux in the equatorial region .",
    "we showed that when we remove the central absorber at @xmath142 , formation of dense gas bulge forces the rotation curve to deviate from that expected from the gravitational potential ( model ii ) .",
    "this indicates that in the central region of the galaxy , the gas absorption or the conversion of the accumulated gas to stars are essential to explain the observed rotation curve",
    ". the mass accretion rate to the central region is @xmath225 when we adopt the absorbing boundary condition .",
    "this accretion rate depends on the initial density of the torus , which can be formed by the infall of intergalactic matter or by the supernova explosions after bursts of star formation in the certain radius of the disk .",
    "when the galaxy was more gas rich in the early stage of its evolution , the accretion rate should be much higher .",
    "we also showed that the gas rotation curve approximately coincides with the rotation curve for stars and dark matter even when magnetic fields are dynamically important .",
    "this justifies us to use the gas rotation curve to estimate the distribution of the dark matter .",
