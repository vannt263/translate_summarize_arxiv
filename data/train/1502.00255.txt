    "the model assumes uniform mixing of all elements , including the radioactive @xmath0ni , across the ejecta .",
    "this model at day 20 produces prominent @xmath0ni lines near 158 kev and 812 kev .",
    "the latter model ( 7 , see  [ sec : models ] ) averaged over period 16 - 35 days does not include mixing and it produces much fainter lines .",
    "finally the `` 50 - 162d w7 '' model corresponds to later observations .",
    "the most prominent features of this model are the @xmath0co lines at 847 and 1238 kev . among all these features the @xmath0co line at 1238 kev",
    "is located in the least complicated portion of the background spectrum .",
    "the spectral redistribution matrix accounts for the instrumental line broadening estimated from the data , accumulated during sn2014j observations .",
    "we parametrize the energy resolution as a gaussian with the energy dependent width @xmath28    compared to our previous analysis we amended the spectral redistribution matrix of spi by including low energy tails , associated with the interactions ( compton scattering ) of incoming photons inside the detector and in the surrounding material .",
    "these photons are still registered as single events in the spi data , but their energies are lower than the true incident energy .",
    "we used the results of monte - carlo simulation of spi energy / imaging response and folded - in our procedure of spectrum reconstruction described above . for steep spectra the account for low energy tail results in a modest @xmath110% change in the spectrum normalization , while for the very hard sn2014j spectrum it produces a low energy tail which provides large contribution to the continuum , while fluxes of narrow lines remain unaffected ( fig.[fig : offdiag ] ) . with this response matrix the crab nebula spectrum , observed by _",
    "integral _ made between feb 21 and 23 , 2014 , is well described by a broken power law obtained by @xcite for earlier crab nebula observations with _ integral _ .    in our analysis",
    "we usually ignore the part of the spectrum at energies higher than 1350 kev , since in the energy range between 1400 and 1700 kev the instrument suffers from the enhanced detector electronic noise , while at even higher energies only weaker lines from @xmath0co decay are expected ( see table  [ tab : tem ] in  [ sec : tem ] ) .",
    "the convolution of the fiducial snia model ( see  [ sec : models ] ) with the simulated spi response confirmed that the contribution of high energy lines is negligible below 1350 kev , at least for `` single '' events considered here .",
    "the inspection of fig.[fig : background ] shows that there is no chance to detect continuum in the spi data for any of our fiducial models .",
    "e.g. , for a 100 kev wide energy bin between 600 and 700 kev the expected @xmath29 after 4 msec observation between days 50 and 162 is @xmath30 . in the real data no evidence for significant continuum above 500 kev",
    "was found in the time - averaged spectra ( see  [ sec : spectra ] below ) .",
    "[ fig : offdiag ] the off - diagonal tail of the 847 and 1238 kev lines dominates over intrinsic sn continuum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : offdiag ] ) , while the line shapes and fluxes are not affected .    in general , we consider the inclusion of the off - diagonal term in the response as an improvement compared to a pure diagonal response .",
    "we used this improved response throughout the paper and at the same time in  [ sec : spectra ] we consider several data sets , which include or exclude the spi data below @xmath1400 kev .",
    "inclusion of the low energy ( @xmath31 kev ) data boosts the s / n , while the exclusion of these data ( dominated by off - diagonal continuum ) makes spectral fits less prone to possible uncertainties in the off - diagonal term calibration .    to verify the whole spi pipeline ,",
    "we have done an independent analysis of the same data using the tools and procedures originally developed and tuned for sn2011fe .",
    "this analysis includes energy calibration , background modeling and the background and source fluxes fitting .",
    "verification of these steps is important since the source ( sn2014j ) is very faint and even subtle changes in the calibration might result in significant changes in the source spectrum .",
    "the fluxes in the 835 - 870 kev band were derived using these two independent pipelines for every revolution during sn2014j observations .",
    "comparing fluxes point by point , we have found very good agreement , with the scatter well within statistical errors .",
    "the signal from sn2014j is seen in both pipelines .",
    "no systematic trends of deviations with the variations of the flux level are found .",
    "we have concluded that the results are fully consistent , within the assumptions made on the background parameterization .",
    "the primary imaging instrument inboard _ integral _ is ibis - a coded - mask aperture telescope with the cdte - based detector isgri .",
    "it has higher sensitivity to continuum emission than spi in the 20 - 300 kev range and has a spatial resolution @xmath32 .",
    "we note here , that neither isgri , nor spi can distinguish the emission of sn2014j from the emission of any other source in m82 .",
    "in particular , m82 hosts two ultra - luminous and variable sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which contribute to the flux below @xmath33 kev .",
    "isgri however can easily differentiate between m82 and m81 , which are separated by @xmath34 .",
    "the energy resolution of isgri is @xmath110% at 100 kev .",
    "the isgri energy calibration uses the procedure implemented in osa 10.039 .",
    "the images in broad energy bands were reconstructed using a standard mask / detector cross - correlation procedure , tuned to produce zero signal on the sky if the count rate across the detector matches the pattern expected from pure background , which was derived from the same dataset by stacking detector images .",
    "the noise in the resulting images is fully consistent with the expected level , determined by photon counting statistics .",
    "the fluxes in broad bands were calibrated using the crab nebula observations with _ integral _ made between feb 21 and 23 .",
    "the @xcite model was assumed as a reference .",
    "the lightcurves in several energy bands were generated using igsri and spi data .",
    "the time bins ( @xmath13 days each ) correspond to individual revolutions of the satellite .",

    "the lightcurves are shown in figs.[fig : lc_isgri]-[fig : lc_spi ] together with a set of representative models ( see  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "for the broad 100 - 200 kev band the conversion of the isgri flux using crab spectrum as a reference is not very accurate because of the difference in the shape of the incident spectra .",

    "the asymmetry is manifested in the emission line shift or / and the double peak emission line profiles @xcite .    to probe a possible asymmetry of sn  2014j ejecta we rely on the nebular optical spectrum taken on day 119 after the @xmath131 maximum , i.e. , 136 d after the explosion @xcite at the 1.5-m russian - turkish telescope ( rtt-150 ) of the tubitak national observatory ( antalya , turkey ) .",

    "it should be emphasised that on day 136 d after the explosion this line is dominated by @xmath0co ; the contribution of @xmath41co and stable co isotopes is negligible .",

    "to summarize , the sn  2014j optical spectrum does not show signatures of strong asymmetry .",
    "we have analyzed a complete set of _ integral _ observations of sn2014j .",
    "we confirm our previous results @xcite that the data are broadly consistent with the predictions of a nearly - chandrasekhar wd explosion , with ( 1d ) deflagration or delayed detonation models providing equally good description ( see tables [ tab : mfit_eandl ] - [ tab : lc_chi2 ] ) . while pure deflagration models are disfavored because of the expected large scale mixing and incomplete burning in 3d simulations , in the 1d case they yield the same gamma - ray flux as the delayed detonation models .",
    "pure detonation ( or strongly sub - chandrasekhar ) models strongly overproduce ( underproduce ) observed gamma - ray flux and can be excluded .",
    "allowing a freedom in the normalization of the model ( equivalent to allowing the initial mass of @xmath0ni to be a free parameter , while keeping other parameters unchanged ) makes all models essentially indistinguishable at the level of statistics , accumulated by _ integral _ .",
