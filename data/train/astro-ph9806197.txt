    "shortly after the big bang , the universe was smooth to a precision of one part in @xmath0 .",
    "we measure this smoothness in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , the photons which provide us with a record of conditions in the early universe because they were last scattered about 300,000 years after the big bang . to remarkable precision ,",
    "the early universe was characterized by isotropic , homogeneous expansion .",
    "however , temperature fluctuations are measured in the cmb ( _ 1 _ ) , and complex structure surrounds us .",
    "there is a simple connection ; the seeds of large - scale structure were infinitesimal density perturbations that grew via gravitational instability into massive structures such as galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "one can search for the primordial seeds of large - scale structure by two complementary techniques .",
    "the cosmic microwave background fluctuations probe the density fluctuations in the early universe on comoving scales greater than @xmath1 mpc .",
    "the gravity field of these density fluctuations also generates fluctuations in the luminous galaxy distribution , as well as deviations from the hubble flow of universal expansion known as peculiar velocities .",
    "optical redshift surveys of galaxies now examine a range of scales out to @xmath1 mpc that overlaps with the range probed by fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the expected rate of growth of density fluctuations depends on the precise cosmology that is adopted ( _ 2 _ ) .",
    "one can therefore use the comparison between microwave background anisotropy and fluctuations in the galaxy distribution to discriminate among rival cosmological models .",
    "scott , silk , and white ( _ 3 _ ) illustrated this comparison .",
    "several similar analyses ( _ 4 - 7 _ ) have been presented but have used only a portion of the compilation of observations that we present .",
    "we examined ten models of structure formation ( table 1 ) , which represent the range of cosmological parameters currently considered viable ( _ 8 _ ) .",
    "each model gives transfer functions that predict how a primordial power spectrum of infinitesimal density perturbations in the early universe develops into cmb anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the galaxy distribution .",
    "a cosmological model whose predictions agree with both types of observations provides a consistent picture of structure formation on scales ranging from galaxy clusters to the present horizon size .",
    "the cosmological parameter @xmath2 gives the ratio of the energy density of the universe to the critical density necessary to stop its expansion .",
    "critical density is @xmath3 for a hubble constant of @xmath4 km / s / mpc .",
    "the portion of this critical energy density contained in matter is @xmath5 , the sum of the contributions from cold dark matter ( cdm ) , hot dark matter ( hdm ) in the form of massive neutrinos , and baryonic matter .",
    "@xmath6 is the fraction of the critical energy density contained in a smoothly distributed vacuum energy referred to as a cosmological constant , @xmath7 .",
    "the age of the universe in each model is determined by the values of @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ; a critical matter density universe has an age of @xmath10gyr ( _ 9 _ ) .",
    "each model has a primordial power spectrum of density perturbations given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the square of a free normalization parameter and @xmath13 is the scalar spectral index ( _ 10 _ ) .",
    "scale - invariance ( _ 11 _ ) corresponds to @xmath14 for adiabatic ( constant entropy ) and @xmath15 for isocurvature ( constant potential ) initial density perturbations . instead of normalizing to the cobe result alone ( _ 12 _ )",
    ", we found the best - fit normalization of each model ( table 2 ) using the entire data compilation .",
    "our rationale is that cobe is just one subset of the available data , albeit with small error bars , and is in fact the data most likely to be affected by a possible contribution of gravitational waves to microwave background anisotropies .",
    "these gravitational waves from inflation would have a significant impact only on large angular scales and are not traced by the large - scale structure observations .",
    "normalizing to all of the data made our results less sensitive to the possible contribution of gravitational waves .",
    "the first seven models ( table 1 ) are based on the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model ( _ 13 _ ) and assume that the initial density perturbations in the universe were adiabatic , as is predicted by the inflationary universe paradigm .",
    "the tilted cdm ( tcdm ) and cold + hot dark matter ( chdm ) models are both motivated by changing the shape of the scdm matter power spectrum to eliminate its problem of excess power on small scales relative to large scales ( _ 14 _ ) .",
    "the chdm model has one family of massive neutrinos which contributes 20% of the critical density ( _ 15 _ ) . for the cosmological constant ( @xmath7cdm ) and open universe ( ocdm ) models ,",
    "@xmath16 guarantees roughly the right shape of the matter power spectrum ( _ 5 _ ) .",
    "we have optimized some parameters of these models : @xmath13 and @xmath17 for tcdm , @xmath18 , and the number of massive neutrino families for chdm , and @xmath19 and @xmath13 for ocdm and @xmath7cdm ( _ 16 _ ) .",
    "the @xmath20cdm model ( _ 17 _ ) contains a vacuum energy contribution from a late - time scalar field with @xmath21 .",
    "this energy behaves like matter today , but during matter - radiation equality and recombination it alters the shape of the matter and radiation power spectra from the otherwise similar scdm model .",
    "the baryonic + cold dark matter ( bcdm ) model ( _ 18 _ ) contains nearly equal amounts of baryonic matter ( @xmath22 ) and cdm ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "its parameters have been tuned to produce a peak due to baryonic acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum at @xmath24mpc@xmath25 , where a similar peak is seen in the 3-dimensional power spectrum of rich abell clusters ( _ 19 _ ) and the 2-dimensional power spectrum of the las campanas redshift survey ( _ 20 _ ) .",
    "the isocurvature cold dark matter ( icdm ) model ( _ 21 , 22 _ ) has a non - gaussian ( @xmath26 ) distribution of isocurvature density perturbations produced by a massive scalar field frozen during inflation .",
    "this causes early structure formation , in agreement with observations of galaxies at high redshift and the lyman @xmath27 forest ( _ 23 _ ) .",
    "the primordial black hole baryonic dark matter ( pbh bdm ) model ( _ 24 _ ) has isocurvature perturbations but no cdm .",
    "the primordial black holes form from baryons at high density regions in the early universe and thereafter behave like cdm .",
    "only a tenth of the critical energy density remains outside the black holes to participate in nucleosynthesis .",
    "these black holes have the appropriate mass ( @xmath28 ) to be the massive compact halo objects ( machos ) which have been detected in our galaxy ( _ 25 _ ) .",
    "albrecht , battye and robinson found that critical matter density topological defect models fail to agree with structure formation observations ( _ 26 _ ) . in the strings+@xmath7 model ( _ 27 _ ) that we examined ,",
    "the nonzero cosmological constant causes a deviation from scaling and makes cosmic strings a viable model .",
    "we used the cmbfast code ( _ 28 _ ) to calculate the predicted radiation and matter power spectra for the scdm , tcdm , chdm , ocdm , @xmath7cdm , and bcdm models .",
    "the models we consider are all consistent with the constraints on the baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis , @xmath29 , allowed by recent observations of primordial deuterium abundance ( _ 29 _ ) .",
    "a hubble constant of @xmath30 encompasses the range of systematic variations between different observational approaches ( _ 30 _ ) .",
    "the age `` crisis '' has abated with recent recalibration by _ hipparcos _ of the distance to the oldest galactic globular clusters leading to a new estimate of their age of @xmath31 gyr ( _ 31 _ ) .",
    "all of our models have an age of at least 13 gyrs except ocdm ( 12 gyrs )",
    ". other constraints , however , appear to limit the viability of our models .",
    "observations of high - redshift damped lyman @xmath27 systems are a concern for the chdm and tcdm models , which have little power at small scales ( _ 32 _ ) .",
    "( _ 33 _ ) used numerical simulations to compare the observed abundance of arcs from strong lensing by galaxy clusters with the predictions of various models and conclude that only ocdm works , and they found that critical density models seriously underpredict the number of arcs .",
    "further support for low-@xmath32 models comes from the cluster baryon fraction of @xmath33 ( _ 34 _ ) .",
    "this favors the ratio of total matter to baryons in the low matter density models considered here and is inconsistent with scdm and @xmath20cdm .",
    "observations of type ia supernovae at high redshift are progressing rapidly , and preliminary results argue in favor of a positive cosmological constant and strongly disfavor @xmath34 ( _ 35 _ ) .",
    "the amount of vacuum energy is constrained to be @xmath35 by qso lensing surveys ( _ 36 _ ) .",
    "it is interesting that direct observations of cosmological parameters favor the low @xmath32 models , but we found that the current discriminatory power of observations of structure formation outweighs that of direct parameter observations .",
    "since the cobe dmr detection of cmb anisotropy ( _ 1 _ ) , there have been over twenty - five additional measurements of anisotropy on angular scales ranging from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the models predict that the spherical harmonic decomposition of the pattern of cmb temperature fluctuations on the sky will have gaussian distributed coefficients @xmath38 with zero mean and variance @xmath39 .",
    "each observation has a window function @xmath40 which makes the total power measured sensitive to a range of angular scales given by @xmath41 :    @xmath42    where cobe found @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( _ 37 _ ) .",
    "this allows the observations of broad - band power to be reported as observations of @xmath45 , and knowing the window function of an instrument one can turn the predicted @xmath46 spectrum of a model into the corresponding prediction for @xmath45 at that angular scale ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    we translated these observations of the radiation power spectrum into estimates of the matter power spectrum on the same scales ( _ 38 _ ) .",
    "the matter power spectrum is determined by the matter transfer function @xmath47 and primordial power spectrum @xmath48 of each model , with @xmath49 .",
    "the matter transfer function describes the processing of initial density perturbations from the big bang during the era of radiation domination ; the earlier a spatial scale came within the horizon , the more its power was dissipated by radiation ( and in the chdm model , by relativistic neutrinos as well ) .",
    "if the baryon fraction is large , the same acoustic oscillations of the photon - baryon fluid that give rise to peaks in the radiation power spectrum are visible in the matter power spectrum ; otherwise , the baryons fall into the potential wells of the dark matter . once matter domination and recombination arrive , @xmath50 maintains its shape and grows as @xmath51 .",
    "thus , determining @xmath50 today allows us to extract the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations that existed when the universe was over a thousand times smaller .    our compilation of observations of fluctuations in the large - scale distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters ( fig .",
    "2a ) includes the determination of @xmath52 , the rms density variation in spheres of radius @xmath53 mpc , based on the abundance of rich galaxy clusters ( _ 39 _ ) .",
    "another measurement of @xmath52 is based upon the evolution of the abundance of rich clusters from redshift 0.5 until now ( _ 40 _ ) .",
    "the predicted value of @xmath52 is given by an integral over the matter power spectrum using a spherical top - hat window function ( _ 41 _ )    @xmath54    which allows observations of @xmath52 to determine the amplitude of @xmath50 on scales @xmath55mpc@xmath25 .",
    "another measurement of the amplitude of the power spectrum comes from observations of galaxy peculiar velocities ( _ 42 _ ) .",
    "our data compilation includes power spectra from four redshift surveys , the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) , the combined iras 1.2 jy and qdot samples , the combined ssrs2+cfa2 survey , and a cluster sample selected from the apm galaxy survey ( _ 43 _ ) .",
    "we also use the power spectrum resulting from the lucy inversion of the angular correlation function of the apm galaxy catalog ( _ 44 , 45 _ ) .",
    "the apm galaxy power spectrum is measured in real space , whereas the others are given in redshift space .",
    "each of these power spectra can be scaled by the square of an adjustable bias parameter , which is expected to be near unity for the galaxy surveys ( _ 46 _ ) .    following the methods of peacock and dodds ( _ 41 _ )",
    ", we performed model - dependent corrections for redshift distortions for each galaxy power spectrum ( _ 47 , 48 _ ) and divided by the square of a trial value of the bias factor .",
    "we then corrected for non - linear evolution ( _ 49 _ ) to produce estimates of the unbiased linear power spectrum from these galaxy surveys .",
    "comparison with the predicted linear @xmath50 determined the best - fit bias parameter of each survey for each model ( table 2 ) .",
    "we compared the corrected large - scale structure data , the cmb anisotropy observations and the predicted matter and radiation power spectra and calculated the @xmath26 value for each model ( table 3 ) .",
    "only points observed at @xmath56mpc@xmath25 were used in selecting best - fit bias factors and normalizations and in calculating @xmath26 ( _ 50 _ ) . on smaller scales , the linearization process yielded qualitative information despite systematic uncertainties .",
    "the current large - scale structure observations agree well with each other in terms of the shape of the uncorrected matter power spectrum ( fig .",
    "the apm clusters are biased compared to galaxies by about a factor of 3 and their power spectrum has a narrower peak and a possible small - scale feature .",
    "there is no clear evidence , however , for scale - dependence in the bias of the various galaxy surveys on linear scales .",
    "the observed galaxy power spectra are smooth , showing no statistically significant oscillations .",
    "a peak in the matter power spectrum appears near @xmath57mpc@xmath25 , which constrains @xmath58 by identifying the epoch of matter - radiation equality ( _ 44 _ ) .",
    "the large - scale structure observations contain too much information to be summarized by a single shape parameter ; no value of the traditional cdm shape parameter ( _ 51 _ ) can simultaneously match the location of this peak and its width .",
    "we find a poor fit for scdm ( fig .",
    "2b ) due to the difference in shape between the theory curve and the data .",
    "the best - fit normalization is only 0.91 that of cobe , as the model would otherwise overpredict the @xmath52 measurements by an even greater amount .",
    "the fit to the cmb is poor , because the saskatoon ( sk ) observations ( _ 52 _ ) would prefer more power .",
    "the fit of the data to the tcdm model ( fig .",
    "2c ) is better , although the peak of the matter power spectrum is still broader than that found in the data .",
    "agreement with the cmb is harmed by the high normalization versus cobe and the tilt on medium scales .",
    "the best - fit model is chdm ( fig .",
    "the agreement with the location and shape of the peak of the matter power spectrum is remarkable , with the exception of the apm cluster power spectrum .",
    "the agreement with cmb anisotropy detections is excellent .",
    "the matter power spectrum of chdm matches the linearized apm galaxy power spectrum down to non - linear scales , making this model a good explanation of structure formation far beyond the scales used for our statistical analysis ( _ 53 _ ) .    for the ocdm model ( fig .",
    "3a ) , @xmath59 is favored by the shape of @xmath50 and the sk and cat ( _ 54 _ ) cmb anisotropy detections and generates agreement between the two observations of @xmath52 .",
    "however , the location of the peak of @xmath50 appears wrong .",
    "this model is our second - best fit but is statistically much worse than chdm . the @xmath7cdm model ( fig .",
    "3b ) is nearly as successful as ocdm .",
    "it is a slightly better fit to the cmb but is worse in comparison to large - scale structure .",
    "the observations of @xmath52 are again in agreement , but the shape of the matter power spectrum does not compare well with that of the apm galaxy survey .",
    "the @xmath20cdm model is too broad at the peak and misses a number of apm galaxy datapoints ( fig .",
    "3c ) , although its agreement with the other datasets is rather good .",
    "it remains to be seen whether other variations of scalar field models can match the observations better .",
    "the bcdm model ( fig .",
    "3d ) does not fit the data . choosing parameters to place an acoustic oscillation peak near @xmath24mpc@xmath25",
    "has generated the wrong shape for @xmath50 , even though the apm galaxies and clusters seem to fit the first and second oscillations , respectively ( _ 55 _ ) .",
    "the main peak of @xmath50 is in the wrong place ; no model with similar oscillations and a baryon content consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis can fix that problem ( _ 18 _ ) .    for the isocurvature cdm model ( fig .",
    "4a ) , the fit to the cmb is poor , due to the rise of @xmath46 on cobe scales , too much power in the first peak near @xmath60 and too little power compared to sk .",
    "the fit to large - scale structure is mediocre .",
    "the pbh bdm model has similar problems compared to the cmb , but the peak location and shape of the matter power spectrum are better ( fig .",
    "4b ) . the strings+@xmath7 model ( fig .",
    "4c ) underestimates the amplitude of the bias - independent measurements and therefore requires a large bias for all types of galaxies , which is difficult to justify .",
    "the rough agreement of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and large - scale structure observations over a wide range of models suggests that the gravitational instability paradigm of cosmological structure formation is correct .",
    "the current set of cmb anisotropy detections may be a poor discriminator among adiabatic models , but it strongly prefers them to non - adiabatic models . several models ( scdm , tcdm , bcdm , and strings+@xmath7 ) have a best - fit normalization significantly different from their cobe normalization and would have been unfairly penalized if normalized to cobe alone . the strings+@xmath7 model already includes a tensor contribution , but scdm and bcdm would benefit from adding a gravitational wave component that brought them into better agreement with cobe without changing the amplitude of their scalar perturbations . adding gravitational waves is not , however , a panacea for those models . in general , the models which are the best fits to the shape of the matter power spectrum prefer to be close to their cobe normalization , which argues against there being a significant tensor contribution to large - angle cmb anisotropies .",
    "large - scale structure data have more discriminatory power at present than do the cmb anisotropy detections .",
    "the average ratio of best - fit biases ( table 2 ) is @xmath61 ( _ 56 _ ) .",
    "most models allow optical galaxies to be nearly unbiased tracers of the dark matter distribution .",
    "the large - scale structure data are smooth enough to set a limit on the baryon fraction , @xmath62 ; when that fraction gets higher than 0.1 the fit worsens ( _ 57 _ ) .    by restricting our analysis to the linear regime and correcting for the mildly scale - dependent effects of redshift distortions and non - linear evolution on those scales , we made it possible to test models quantitatively .",
    "the most likely cosmology is cold + hot dark matter , which is the only model allowed at the 95% confidence level .",
    "the disagreement between the data and the predictions of the other models is sufficient to rule out all of them at above 99% confidence unless there are severe systematic problems in the data ( _ 58 _ ) .",
    "chdm itself is not statistically very likely because of the apm cluster survey @xmath50 , which no model fits much better , and which disagrees somewhat with the galaxy power spectra .",
    "dropping the apm cluster @xmath50 would give chdm a @xmath26 of 66/62 , which is within the 68% confidence interval .",
    "it is worth investigating whether the apm cluster power spectrum contains a scale - dependent bias or if its errors have somehow been underestimated .",
    "we have extracted the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations from the data and found that it agrees well with that of the cold + hot dark matter model .",
    "this does not provide direct evidence for the existence of hdm , which requires experimental confirmation of neutrino mass .",
    "the chdm model has other observational hurdles to overcome , including evidence for early galaxy formation on small scales where this model has little power , although it is impressive that chdm agrees with the linearized apm data out to @xmath63mpc@xmath25 .",
    "if the rapidly improving type ia supernovae observations follow current trends there may be enough statistical power in the direct observations of cosmological parameters to make ocdm and @xmath7cdm preferred to chdm , although in that case none of these models would be a satisfactory fit to both the supernovae and structure formation observations .",
    "less fluctuation growth occurs , for example , in a universe with matter density below the critical einstein - de sitter value than in a universe at critical density , because of the weakened role of gravity at late times .",
