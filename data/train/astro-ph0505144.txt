    "intergalactic gas in clusters of galaxies is magnetized ( see reviews by kronberg 1994 ; carilli & taylor 2002 ; govoni & feretti 2004 ) .",
    "the number of clusters that exhibit detectable synchrotron emission is relatively small , but it is believed that a magnetic field is present in most clusters ( unlike relativistic electrons ) .",
    "therefore , a more informative observational tracer of intracluster magnetic fields is faraday rotation of the polarization plane of background radio sources and central radio galaxies .",
    "clarke , kronberg & bhringer ( 2001 ) conclude , from their statistical study of faraday rotation in 16 galaxy clusters , that random magnetic fields of a strength ( 510)@xmath9 ( with @xmath10 the field scale ) permeate the gas within about @xmath11 from the cluster centre ; the area covering factor of magnetic fields is close to unity .",
    "the faraday rotation measures detected are about @xmath8 for the lines of sight through clusters central parts and about @xmath12 farther out ( see also clarke 2004 ; johnston - hollitt & ekers 2004 ) . important constraints on intracluster magnetic fields come from limits on x - ray emission produced from microwave background photons by inverse compton scattering off relativistic electrons ( bagchi , pislar & lima neto 1998 ; sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "observational evidence is compatible with a random magnetic field of r.m.s .",
    "strength of @xmath13@xmath14 and coherence length of about 10@xmath15 .",
    "faraday rotation maps of a number of radio galaxies in clusters have also been analyzed .",
    "eilek and owen ( 2002 ) studied faraday rotation maps of radio sources in the centres of the abell clusters a400 and a2634 , and found patches of rm fluctuations on scales about 10@xmath16 . assuming this to be also the coherence scale for the field , these authors deduce field strengths of 1@xmath17 .",
    "vogt and enlin ( 2003 , 2005 ) , using a novel technique ( enlin & vogt 2003 ) , estimate magnetic field strength to be @xmath18 in a2634 , @xmath19 in a400 and @xmath20 in hydra  a. they obtain field correlation length of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for these clusters , respectively .",
    "it can not be excluded , however , that the faraday rotation of cluster radio sources is contaminated by that arising in dense turbulent cocoons around the radio galaxies , rather than in the intracluster medium proper ( rudnick and blundell 2003 ; see enlin et al .",
    "2003 for another view ) .",
    "for this reason , the statistical studies of faraday rotation of background radio sources , referred to above , provide perhaps a more convincing evidence for cluster - wide magnetic fields and their properties .",
    "the origin of the cluster magnetic fields remains unclear .",
    "carilli & taylor ( 2002 ) ( see also tribble 1993a ) argue that the small value of electric resistivity of the intracluster plasma guarantees that the decay time of magnetic field will be comparable to or exceed the cluster lifetime . they conclude that any magnetic field ( e.g. , that captured by a cluster during its formation ) would survive for a long time . however , any inhomogeneous magnetic field will drive motions via the lorentz force , and the motions will decay , plausibly in the form of decaying mhd turbulence ( e.g. , biskamp 2003 ; see below ) .",
    "the turbulent decay time is comparable to the eddy turnover time of the largest eddies , about @xmath24 , irrespective of the resistivity or viscosity of the gas .",
    "( here we have taken a coherence scale of order @xmath25 kpc for the field and the induced motions , with associated turbulent velocities of order @xmath26 ) .",
    "although the energy density in mhd turbulence decays with time as a power law , this time scale is still much shorter than the typical age of a cluster , which is thought to be several billion years .",
    "therefore , one has to provide explicit explanation of the origin and persistence of magnetic fields in the clusters ; reference to the low ohmic resistivity of the intracluster plasma is not sufficient if the gas is turbulent or the magnetic field is tangled .",
    "an obvious option to explain intergalactic magnetic fields is to consider magnetic fields stripped from galaxies .",
    "since the intracluster gas is enriched with metals , at least part of it originates in galaxies ( sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "however , the strength of magnetic field produced by the stripping can not exceed @xmath27 even in the cores of rich clusters and even if spiral galaxies with relatively strong large - scale field are involved ( see appendix  [ seed ] ) .",
    "another possibility is that the intracluster field is supplied by active galaxies within the cluster . as we discuss in appendix  [ seed ]",
    ", this mechanisms can provide relatively strong magnetic field but fails to explain how the field can be maintained against turbulent decay .",
    "in addition , it is not quite clear how efficiently the magnetized relativistic plasma of the radio lobes can be mixed with the thermal intergalactic plasma and what would be the resulting scale of magnetic field .",
    "altogether , the above mechanisms can only provide suitable seed magnetic field for the dynamo action in the intracluster plasma .    in most astrophysical systems , like disc galaxies , stars and planets ,",
    "rotation is crucial for maintaining their magnetic fields , both by providing strong shear and by making ( when coupled with stratification ) random flows helical , and hence leading to mean - field dynamo action .",
    "however , galaxy clusters are believed to have fairly weak rotation ( if any at all ) , so one has to appeal to some other mechanism for understanding cluster magnetism .",
    "another possibility to generate magnetic fields is related to the fluctuation dynamo action ( batchelor 1950 ; kazantsev 1967 ) , where random flow of electrically conducting fluid generates random magnetic field ( zeldovich , ruzmaikin & sokoloff 1990 ) .",
    "this mechanism does not require any rotation or density stratification , and only relies on the random nature of the flow ; so fluctuation dynamos can be active in virtually any turbulent environment where the plasma is ionized .",
    "apart from the randomness of the flow , it is required that the magnetic reynolds number is large enough , i.e. , that the electric conductivity is high enough , and/or plasma motions are sufficiently intense , and/or their scale is sufficiently large .",
    "the earliest theories of intracluster magnetic fields were based , implicitly or explicitly , on fluctuation dynamo theory under the assumption that galaxy clusters are steady - state turbulent systems ( jaffe 1980 ; roland 1981 ; ruzmaikin , sokoloff & shukurov 1989 ; goldman & rephaeli 1991 ; de young 1992 ) .",
    "the source of turbulence adopted by several authors were turbulent wakes of the cluster galaxies .",
    "this picture has to be reconsidered for several reasons .",
    "firstly , turbulence from galactic wakes can fill the cluster volume only if the effective galactic radius is of order @xmath7 ( e.g. , ruzmaikin et al .",
    "1989 ) , i.e. , if the interstellar gas is not stripped by the ram pressure of the intracluster gas .",
    "if the gas stripping is complete , the wake is only produced by gravitational accretion ( bondi 1952 ) , and its radius is about the accretion radius @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the speed of sound , @xmath30 is the galactic speed , @xmath31 is the galactic mass , and @xmath32 is newton s gravitational constant . for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "the gravitational accretion radius @xmath36 is much smaller than both the galactic radius and the apparent scale of the random magnetic field in the intergalactic gas ( both usually assumed to be of order @xmath7 ) .",
    "hence , sufficiently strong , volume - filling turbulent wakes whose width is comparable to the galactic size can only arise if the galaxies retain significant amounts of their interstellar gas . if the stripping of interstellar gas by ram pressure is efficient , galactic wakes are rather weak ( portnoy , pistinner & shaviv 1993 ; balsara , livio & odea 1994 ; acreman et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ; see however toniazzo & schindler 2001 who argue that the stripping efficiency is exaggerated in the above papers ) .",
    "therefore turbulence generated in galactic wakes may not fill the cluster volume ( see also sect .",
    "[ gw ] ) .",
    "further , numerical simulations of de young ( 1992 ) , using a closure model , gave pessimistic estimates for magnetic fields produced by the dynamo when the turbulence is induced by galactic wakes .",
    "however , it is not clear if the resolution of those simulations ( i.e. , the effective magnetic reynolds number ) was high enough to obtain dynamo action , so this objection to the dynamo models is questionable .",
    "recent direct simulations of dynamo action in turbulent flows ( haugen , brandenburg & dobler 2003 , 2004 ; schekochihin et al .",
    "2004 ) have confirmed the efficiency of dynamo action in random non - helical flows .",
    "perhaps more importantly , cluster dynamics has been reconsidered recently , and the emerging picture is very different in that clusters may not be relaxed systems , but still remain in the state of formation via major mergers and accretion of smaller - mass subclusters .",
    "numerical simulations and recent observations strongly suggest that a random flow , perhaps of turbulent nature , can be maintained for a few crossing times of the forming galaxy cluster ( norman & bryan 1999 ) .",
    "roettiger et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) have found that magnetic field can be amplified by these motions ( see also results obtained with sph simulations by dolag , bartelmann & lesch 1999 , 2002 ) . however , the resolution of the simulations is still poor , and quantitative estimates of the turbulence parameters and especially of its effects on magnetic field are very uncertain .",
    "in addition to the volume - filling flow produced during the cluster formation , significant random flows can still be generated in wakes behind infalling subclusters and cluster galaxies .",
    "these are not expected to fill the cluster volume , but we argue below that they can have significant area covering factor .",
    "there is also a possibility that radio galaxies can stir the intracluster gas as their plasma buoyantly rises through the gas ( brggen et al .",
    "2002 ; enlin & heinz 2002 ) .",
    "another possible consequence of radio galaxy jets and/or lobes propagating at subrelativistic speeds through the cluster plasma , is the generation of turbulence in a cocoon surrounding the radio source ( see for example reynolds , heinz & begelman 2002 ) .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows .",
    "we consider the evolution of turbulence in the intracluster gas of a galaxy cluster during and after its formation in sect .",
    "random flows produced during the merger epoch can lead to magnetic field generation via the fluctuation dynamo as discussed in sect .",
    "[ mfdt ] . in sects",
    "[ dt ] and [ sfd ] we present evidence that the decay of both magnetic and kinetic energies after the epoch of major mergers will be a power law in time , rather than exponential , because of the turbulent nature of the flow . during the decay phase of the turbulence , the correlation scale of the magnetic field will grow ( frisch 1995 ; olesen 1997 ; biskamp & mller 1999 ; christensson , hindmarsh & brandenburg 2001 ) , which slows down the decay of the faraday rotation measure produced in the intracluster gas ( sect .  [ odfrm ] ) . in sect .",
    "[ mmtw ] we argue that significant turbulence and magnetic field amplification can occur in turbulent wakes of smaller - mass subclusters and cluster galaxies .",
    "the turbulent wakes may not fill the volume , but can cover the cluster s projected area ( sect .",
    "[ cftw ] ) .",
    "we present order - of - magnitude estimates of the parameters of the random flows at various stages of the cluster evolution in sect .",
    "[ cfit ] , and of magnetic fields generated by the flows , in sect .",
    "[ mfdt ] , which are further substantiated by numerical simulations of dynamo action in driven and decaying random flows discussed in sect .",
    "faraday rotation measure and polarized radio emission produced by these magnetic fields are discussed in sect .",
    "our results are summarized in sect .",
    "[ disc ] and table  [ res ] .",
    "an upper limit on the turbulent velocity in a steady - state galaxy cluster follows from the requirement that the rate of dissipation of the turbulent energy should not exceed the x - ray luminosity of the cluster @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the turbulent speed and scale , respectively , and @xmath41 is the mass of the intergalactic gas .",
    "this yields @xmath42 this restriction applies to a steady state , and stronger turbulence can be driven in an evolving cluster , where the energy released by the decay of turbulent motions heats up the gas .",
    "therefore , turbulent velocities significantly exceeding the above value can be considered as an indication of the cluster s ongoing evolution .",
    "the turbulent nature of the flow is important , however : eq .",
    "( [ upperlimit ] ) only applies to turbulent flows and has to be reconsidered in the case of a random flow without turbulent energy cascade .",
    "as we argue below , turbulent motions during the epoch of cluster formation are intense enough to violate the constraint ( [ upperlimit ] ) because they keep evolving and their dissipation contributes to the heating of the intracluster gas to the virial temperature .",
    "we now discuss various sources of turbulence in galaxy clusters .",
    "theories of hierarchical structure formation suggest that clusters of galaxies have been assembled relatively recently .",
    "@xmath43-body simulations indicate that the clusters form at the intersection of dark matter filaments in the large - scale structure , and result from both major mergers of objects of comparable mass ( of order @xmath44 ) and the accretion of smaller clumps onto massive protoclusters .",
    "it is likely that intense random vortical flows , if not turbulence , are produced in the merger events ( kulsrud et al .",
    "1997 ; norman & bryan 1999 ; ricker & sarazin 2001 ) .",
    "these would originate not only due to vorticity generation in oblique accretion shocks and instabilities during the cluster formation , but also in the wakes of the smaller clumps . in this section",
    "we summarize some of the work on the cluster - wide turbulence resulting from major mergers .",
    "its consequences for the generation of cluster magnetic fields are considered in sect .",
    "[ mfdt ] .",
    "there have been several numerical simulations of gas dynamics during the formation of galaxy clusters .",
    "norman & bryan ( 1999 ) find that the intracluster medium becomes turbulent during cluster formation , with turbulent velocities of about @xmath45 within @xmath46 from the centre of a cluster and eddy sizes ranging from 50 to 500kpc ; the random flow is volume filling ( see also sunyaev , norman & bryan 2003 ) . in the cluster merger model of ricker & sarazin ( 2001 ) , ram pressure displaces gas in the cluster core from the bottom of the potential well .",
    "the resulting convective plumes produce large - scale disordered motions with eddy size up to several hundred kiloparsecs ; even after 15gyr of evolution , turbulent velocities in the inner parts remain at a surprisingly high level of 1040% of the sound speed ( i.e. , 100@xmath45 ) , and grow up to the sound speed in the outer parts .",
    "observational evidence of intracluster turbulence is scarce . from analysis of pressure fluctuations as revealed in x - ray observations , schueker et al.(2004 ) argue that the integral turbulent scale in the coma cluster is close to 100kpc , and they assume a turbulent speed of @xmath47 at that scale .",
    "the nonthermal broadening , by the turbulence , of x - ray spectral lines of ionized iron can be detectable with future x - ray observatories ( inogamov & sunyaev 2003 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of all available simulations is rather coarse ( of order @xmath7 or worse ) and only comparable with the apparent scale of the intracluster magnetic field .",
    "even if the random nature of the resulting flow is obvious , it is not clear if it will evolve into developed turbulence , i.e. , if the turbulent cascade is established to carry energy to small scales where it dissipates into heat . from the viewpoint of magnetic field generation ,",
    "the presence of turbulence as such is not required ; the randomness of the flow is sufficient ( kazantsev 1967 ; zeldovich et al .  1990 ) .",
    "however , the dynamics of the flow and its evolution do depend on whether or not the turbulent cascade persists ( see sect .",
    "[ dt ] ) .",
    "the flow can become turbulent if the kinematic reynolds number in the intracluster gas , @xmath48 , is large enough .",
    "following sarazin ( 1988 ) and ricker & sarazin ( 2001 ) , an estimate of @xmath48 can be obtained as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the effective kinematic viscosity , @xmath29 is the speed of sound ( assumed to be close to the thermal speed ) , @xmath51 is the mach number , @xmath52 is the ion mean free path , and subscript ` 0 ' refers to the energy - range values .",
    "here we have introduced parameter @xmath53 that quantifies the poorly understood behaviour of viscosity in the intracluster plasma . the standard , spitzer s value of @xmath52 can be written as @xmath54 with @xmath55 the electron number density . for @xmath56 , @xmath57@xmath11 and @xmath58 ,",
    "this yields @xmath59@xmath60 .",
    "this estimate is , however , suspect because the mean free path is comparable to the scale of inhomogeneities in the gas .",
    "it is also clear that even a weak seed intracluster magnetic field could strongly reduce the effective viscosity and make it anisotropic",
    ". the effective reynolds number can be significantly larger if any shorter length scale plays the role rather than the coulomb mean free path , or a frequency higher than the ion collision frequency ( these may be associated with plasma instabilities and/or waves ) .",
    "schekochihin et al .",
    "( 2005b ) argue that the firehose and/or mirror instabilities can provide the effective diffusion in the magnetized plasma ; the corresponding length scale is the ion gyroradius , a quantity normally much smaller than the mean free path .",
    "these uncertainties are allowed for , in a heuristic manner , by choosing @xmath61 ; fabian et al .",
    "( 2005 ) scale their results by @xmath62 .",
    "this prescription can be an oversimplification as it omits plausibly important physical effects arising from the anisotropy of viscosity in magnetized plasma ( cf .",

    "( [ reyn ] ) suggests that it will be large enough as to ensure that random motions driven by major merger events can become turbulent .",
    "only this fact is important for our purposes in this paper .",
    "our simulations of a flow driven by external random force ( sect .  [ sfd ] ) have been performed for @xmath63400 , and they do indeed show a flow with broad range of scales typical of turbulent flows ( and so inertia forces dominate over viscosity ) , even if the inertial range is not wide at these modest reynolds numbers .    to summarize , the above results seem to converge to the following picture .",
    "random motions driven in major merger events have the typical initial speed of @xmath64 and scale @xmath65@xmath3 , so that the turnover time of the energy - range eddy is @xmath66@xmath67",

    "turbulent kinetic energy decays slower , as a power law ( e.g. , landau & lifshitz 1975 , frisch 1995 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that kinetic energy mainly decays at small scales , to where it is constantly supplied by the turbulent cascade . as a result",

    "it is related to the turbulent velocity at wave number @xmath78 via @xmath79 ; @xmath80 has a maximum at a certain wave number @xmath72 , which is therefore called the energy - range wave number .",
    "turbulent flow remains in a statistically steady state despite viscous dissipation at small scales if it is driven at larger scales .",
    "when such a driving ceases , the turbulence decays .",
    "motions at small scales are the first to be affected by viscosity .",

    "consider the time - dependent total specific turbulent energy @xmath82 , which is approximately equal to that at the energy - range scale , @xmath83 , if the inertial part of the spectrum is steep enough . on the other hand , @xmath84 .",
    "as long as the reynolds number remains large , and so viscosity at @xmath72 is negligible , energy at the energy - range wave number @xmath85 mainly decays because it cascades to smaller scales .",

    "there are arguments suggesting that @xmath96 is a better acceptable value than @xmath99 ; in particular , the coefficient @xmath81 is time - dependent for @xmath99 , and this makes the energy decay significantly slower than that obtained above ( frisch 1995 ) .",
    "also @xmath99 would be relevant for an incompressible flow , whereas the cluster flows are expected to be mildly compressible , and @xmath96 could be more appropriate .",
    "the turbulence decay is sensitive to the detailed physical nature of the system , and it is often slower than derived above . the decay of the mhd turbulence can be significantly slowed down if the system has non - zero invariants such as magnetic helicity and/or cross - helicity ( biskamp 2003 ) .",
    "if the intracluster seed magnetic fields are due to stripping of the galactic magnetic fields , then they may have both types of helicities .",
    "the decay law is also sensitive to the relation between the turbulent energy - range scale and the size of the system ; the decay speeds up to become @xmath102 when the two scales become comparable and the value of @xmath72 can not decrease any further ( skrbek & stalp 2000 ; touil et al .",

    "clearly , turbulence in clusters seems to be useful to understand several diverse aspects of cluster physics .",
    "random motions during and immediately after the major merger epoch are plausibly volume - filling . however , random flows produced by the wakes can have area covering factor of order unity , but the volume filling factor of such wakes can be relatively small , @xmath502 , leaving large quiescent regions between the wakes . therefore , a typical line of sight passes through a turbulent region with an r.m.s .",
    "speed of a 200@xmath2 , producing some observational signatures of developed turbulence , and yet there is enough space to accommodate well - ordered morphological features apparently unaffected by any random motions .",
    "for example , in the core of the perseus cluster , where the density is higher ( churazov et al .",
    "2004 ) , with @xmath503 @xmath504 for @xmath505 kpc , the mean free path is smaller @xmath506 kpc , and the wakes can have a potentially larger filling factors @xmath507 , for @xmath508 .",
    "thus the presence of long h@xmath195 filaments observed by fabian et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) in the core of the perseus cluster may not be inconsistent with various evidence for random motions in this cluster core ( churazov et al .",
    "2004 ; rebusco et al .",
    "a possible signature of such spatially intermittent turbulence could be a specific shape of spectral lines , with a narrow core , produced in quiescent regions , accompanied by nonthermally broadened wings .",
    "it would be interesting to pursue this idea further in a more quantitative fashion .    in the presence of random motions , any pre - existing magnetic field",
    "will be rapidly destroyed owing to a reduction of its scale by the velocity shear . even in a quiescent medium ,",
    "any nonuniform magnetic would decay by driving motions whose kinetic energy can be efficiently converted into heat because the intracluster gas is expected to be rather viscous . therefore , random magnetic fields confidently revealed in many clusters through their faraday rotation must be constantly maintained even if the electrical conductivity of the intracluster gas is large",
    ".    however , the same random motions  either turbulent or not  will generate magnetic fields via the fluctuation dynamo action at all the stages of the cluster evolution .",
    "the field is amplified by random shear , which reduces its scale along the directions perpendicular to the shear layers .",
    "this makes the spatial distribution of the magnetic field intermittent .",
    "numerical simulations give an impression of strong field regions being largely confined into magnetic sheets and ribbons ( and , with lower probability , filaments ) wherein its strength is similar to that given by energy equipartition with the overall kinetic energy density .",
    "following subramanian ( 1999 ) , we argue that the volume filling factor of the magnetic structures within a turbulent cell ( provided they are mostly sheets rather than filaments ) is of order 0.10.2 .",
    "our numerical simulations confirm this picture , but add to it a weaker volume - filling magnetic background , so that the total magnetic energy density is about 1/51/3 of the kinetic energy density of the random flow .",
    "the limited experience available with fluctuation dynamo models at large magnetic prandtl number seems to indicate that magnetic fields can be closer to energy equipartition with turbulence in more realistic models .",
    "the ( random ) faraday rotation measures produced by such magnetic fields are in the @xmath509 range of 100@xmath8 in agreement with observations .",
    "we note , however , that , according to our estimates , the scale of the magnetic field is @xmath47940kpc , i.e. , a factor of a few larger than what is usually assumed .",
    "the scale of the field is smaller , of order a @xmath510 , for galactic wakes ; it could also be smaller if there were other sources of stirring like radio galaxies .",
    "the maximum field strength in the magnetic structures is about 2@xmath511 , whereas its r.m.s .",
    "value within a turbulent cell is 1@xmath5 .",
    "such r.m.s .",
    "field strengths are in better accord with those inferred from synchrotron intensity assuming equipartition between magnetic fields and cosmic rays , or with inverse compton limits .",
    "we predict that synchrotron emission from cluster radio halos similar to that in the coma cluster can be significantly polarized at short wavelengths @xmath5125 cm .",

    "there is a number of sources of seed magnetic fields in galaxy clusters .",
    "it is well known that the intracluster medium ( icm ) has high metallicity which must have been produced in stars in galaxies and subsequently ejected into the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) and then into the icm .",
    "since the ism is likely to be magnetized with fields of order a few @xmath150 g , this would lead to a seed field in the icm .",
    "one can roughly estimate the seed field resulting from stripping the galactic gas , by using magnetic flux conservation under spherically symmetric expansion ; that is @xmath513 . for @xmath514 , and @xmath515@xmath516 ,",
    "one gets @xmath517@xmath518 .",
    "one may get even larger seed fields if there is a substantial number of active galaxies with magnetized outflows : if about @xmath519 galaxies have mass outflow with @xmath520 lasting for @xmath521 , with a poynting flux about 10% of the material flux , and the field gets mixed into the cluster gas over a mpc sized region , @xmath522 would result ( brandenburg 2000 ) .",
    "this estimate , however , assumes that all the intracluster gas has been processed through the outflows , which may be an exaggeration .",
    "another source of seed fields is likely to be the outflows from earlier generation of active galaxies ( radio galaxies and quasars ) ( rees 1994 ; goldshmidt & rephaeli 1994 ; medina - tanco & enlin 2001 ; furlanetto & loeb 2001 ; colgate , li & pariev 2001 ) .",
    "such outflows can produce magnetized plasma bubbles in some fraction of the intergalactic volume ( typically of order @xmath523  furlanetto & loeb 2001 ) which , when incorporated into the icm , would seed the general cluster gas with magnetic fields . if one assumes that the cluster gas is @xmath519 times denser than the intergalactic medium and blindly uses the enhancement of the bubble field due to compressions during cluster formation , one can get fields as large as @xmath524@xmath329 in the icm ( furlanetto & loeb 2001 ) . however this is to ignore the issue of how the field in the magnetized bubble , especially if it is predominantly relativistic plasma from a radio galaxy , mixes with the unmagnetized and predominantly thermal gas during cluster formation , and the resulting effects on both the field strength and coherence scale ( see enlin 2003 for the related problem of the escape of cosmic rays out of radio cocoons ) .",
    "it is likely that , while agns and galaxies provide a potentially strong seed magnetic field , there would still be a need for their subsequent amplification and maintenance against turbulent decay .",
    "altogether , we adopt @xmath525 as a plausible estimate of the seed magnetic field in the intracluster gas .",
    "in order to calculate the autocorrelation function of the faraday rotation measure , defined in eq .",
    "( [ rmdef ] ) , we introduce coordinates @xmath526 with the @xmath527-axis directed towards the observer , and those in the plane of the sky , @xmath528 .",
    "we assume the magnetic field to be an isotropic , homogeneous , random field with zero mean value .",
    "then its equal - time , two - point correlation tensor has the form @xmath529 , where @xmath530 here @xmath531 denotes the ensemble average , @xmath532 , and @xmath533 ( see section  34 of landau & lifshitz 1975 ; monin & yaglom 1975 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath534 and @xmath535 are known as the longitudinal and transverse correlation function of the magnetic field , respectively . since @xmath536 , @xmath537",
    "we also assume for simplicity that the electron density is uncorrelated with the magnetic field and also constant over the field correlation length .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that random gas motions in galaxy clusters are quite subsonic .",
    "the correlation function of @xmath418 is then @xmath538 here we have assumed that @xmath415 is much greater than the correlation length of the magnetic field , @xmath539 , @xmath540 and @xmath541 .    for the sake of illustration , consider the longitudinal correlation function of the form @xmath542 which corresponds to the one - dimensional magnetic spectrum of the form @xmath543 ( monin & yaglom 1975 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath544 attains maximum at a wavenumber @xmath545 , ( or a scale @xmath546 ) , whereas the longitudinal correlation scale is given by @xmath547^{-1}\\int_0^\\infty m_\\mathrm{l}(r)\\,dr = l_b\\sqrt{\\pi/2}$ ] ."
