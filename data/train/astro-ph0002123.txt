    "the nature and origin(s ) of galactic bulges are key aspects of any galaxy formation model , and of the hubble galaxy classification sequence . however , the present - day properties of bulges in spiral galaxies are not well known ( eg silk & wyse 1993 ; wyse , et al .",
    "do bulges form late , early or continuously ? are bulges related to halos ?",
    "are they single stellar populations ?",
    "the existence of smooth and/or discontinuous gradients in age and/or metallicity in the stellar population(s ) in the galactic bulge can help to discriminate between these different scenarios , and is the topic of this paper .",
    "is there evidence for the widely repeated assumption that the galactic bulge is old ?",
    "recently published colour magnitude diagrams from hst / wfpc2 and hst / wfc1 of the galactic bulge and the bulge globular clusters ( vallenari et al .",
    "1996 , ortolani et al .",
    "1995 , holtzman et al 1993 ) while dominated by fairly old stars , show a substantial population of stars above the dominant old turnoff . are these foreground disk stars , or is there a minority very young bulge population ?",
    "since even a minority young bulge population is of interest , we examine here the limits on young stars in the bulge windows .",
    "one common approach to determine the properties of the bulge is to study the so called bulge globular clusters ( see e.g. zinn 1996 , ortolani et al .",
    "1995 , minniti 1996 ) .",
    "while primarily motivated by observational convenience , the rationale behind this approach is the assumption that these clusters may be valid tracers of the stellar population(s ) of the bulge ( see however zinn 1996 and harris 1998 ) formation scenarios relevant to this approach include the possibility that the bulge has been assembled from numerous such clusters and these are the last surviving ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) , or that the clusters formed a system associated with the bulge rather than with the rest of the spheroidal component(s ) of the galaxy .",
    "thus the idea is that we may be able to infer the age and/or metallicity of the bulge stellar population either directly from studies of these clusters , or through differential studies of the clusters and field stars , under the assumption of similar metallicity .",
    "since there is no ab initio understanding of the formation of either galactic bulges or globular clusters , and the age range of the globular cluster system remains a topic of active debate , such analyses merit close scrutiny .",
    "the most recent and extensive such analysis is that of ortolani et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) who observed two such globular clusters , ngc6553 and ngc6528 , with hst / wfpc2 , and deduced that the bulge has the same age as the halo .",
    "analysis of suitably - chosen globular clusters introduces several possible complications .",
    "the first is the major problem of defining a proper population of ` bulge ' globular clusters .",
    "some of the clusters used , e.g. ter7 , have recently been shown to be associated with the satellite dwarf galaxy sgr dsph , rather than with the galaxy itself .",
    "they may therefore not be representative of the galactic bulge .",
    "the method of comparing ridge - lines of globular clusters to infer relative ages requires the clusters in question to have similar metallicities , and relative chemical abundances of the alpha - elements , to avoid an age - metallicity degeneracy ( stetson et al .",
    "1996 , vandenberg et al . 1990 , 1996 ) . new results by cohen et al",
    "( 1999 ) show that ngc6553 may be as much as @xmath7 dex more metal - rich than 47 tuc , illustrating the potentially large effects of metallicity range .",
    "the impressive recent study of rosenberg et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , indicating a dispersion in ages for the intermediate metallicity globular clusters , and a large systematic age difference between the metal - rich and metal - poor clusters illustrates the complexity .",
    "another potential uncertainty is that the metallicity distribution function of the stars in the galactic bulge is more similar to that in the solar - neighbourhood ( cf .",
    "wyse and gilmore 1995 ) than to that for clusters within 5 degrees of the galactic centre ( minniti 1996 ; barbuy et al .",
    "the bulge cluster distribution is both more narrow and less metal - rich than the bulge field stars , complicating any direct comparison .",
    "clearly , if one wishes to know the age of the bulge field stars , it is desirable to observe the stars in the bulge directly .",
    "direct studies of the bulge are difficult due to the severe crowding towards the central regions of the galaxy and the large , patchy , reddening along the line of sight .",
    "several detailed studies of the outer galactic bulge exist , providing kinematics and chemical abundance distribution functions ( ibata and gilmore 1995a , 1995b ; minniti et al .",
    "1995 ; see also wyse et al .",
    "for the inner bulge several analyses of the low reddening baade s window are available ( e.g. ortolani et al .",
    "1995 , vallenari et al .",
    "1996 , holtzman et al .",
    "1993 , terndrup 1988 , ng et al .",
    "1996 ) , with direct studies of the inner bulge field stars in the near - ir recently also becoming available ( frogel et al .",
    "1999 ) , and even mid - ir iso photometry ( omont et al . 1999 , glass et al . 1999 ) .",
    "additionally , many recent studies have emphasized the high continuing rate of star formation in the inner bulge / disk .",
    "do these stars diffuse with time the few hundred parsecs into the sgr and baade s windows ?",
    "the interpretation of extant data is unclear , with a variety of contradictory results .",
    "vallenari et al .",
    "( 1996 ) use a mixture of wf / pc-1 and ntt data while holtzman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) rely exclusively on ( the same ) wf / pc-1 data .",
    "both groups reached the conclusion that the bulge is dominated by a significant young stellar populations .",
    "ortolani et al .",
    "( 1995 ) using similar ntt data for baade s window found the bulge to be as old as the halo .    the confusion among the results from the space based observations should be contrasted with ground based optical observations which find little evidence for a substantial young stellar population(s ) in the galactic bulge ( eg terndrup 1988 ) , albeit rather far from the centre .",
    "note however that these observations do not cover the main - sequence turn - off and the results are based on the giant branch .",
    "the main - sequence turn - off is more sensitive to detection of a significantly younger stellar populations .",
    "further complication is provided by studies of oh / ir stars , suspected to be of intermediate age , which are common in the inner bulge , or disk ( sevenster et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the distribution function of chemical abundances is a key parameter defining a stellar population . in",
    "the outer galactic bulge ibata & gilmore ( 1995b ) derived the relevant distribution function from spectroscopy of k giants .",
    "they found a mean abundance of @xmath8 dex , with a very wide dispersion . in baade s window mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) and sadler et al .",
    "( 1996 ) provided similar results .",
    "sadler et al . (",
    "1996 ) found for 400 k giants a mean abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath9 dex , with more than half the sample in the range @xmath10 } < + 0.3 { \\rm dex}$ ] .",
    "this is similar to the results from the detailed spectroscopic analysis of mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) .",
    "a metallicity gradient has been suspected for fields outside baade s window , terndrup ( 1988 ) and minniti et al .",
    "the important conclusion from the spectroscopic analyses is that the stellar populations of the inner galactic bulge are complex , and that their analysis requires careful consideration of projected disk and other populations .    in this paper",
    "we study colour - magnitude diagrams , derived from archival hst / wfpc2 images , for 4 fields and two clusters towards the galactic bulge and one `` disk '' cluster .",
    "we perform a purely differential study of the properties of the galactic bulge population(s ) , quantifying any systematic offsets and/or gradients in age and/or metallicity in the field population(s ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; in sect .",
    "2 we detail the observations used and in sect . 3 describe how we derive the photometric magnitudes from the images . sect . 4 discusses reddening and distances for the individual fields and clusters , and the utility of the cluster data .",
    "5 discusses the age of the bulge , while sect .",
    "6 asks the question whether a metallicity gradient might be present in the inner bulge .",
    "7 includes a summarizing discussion which puts our results into the context of other studies .",
    "a brief summary is found in sect .",
    "all observations analyzed here were obtained from the hst - archive . the observations for the two clusters , ngc6528 and ngc6553 ,",
    "have previously been reported and discussed in ortolani et al.(1995 ) and the observation of ngc5927 in fullton et al.(1996 ) . however , to get a set of data which is consistently treated we have derived our own photometry from the original images . the images are detailed in table [ fieldlist ] , and their positions on the sky are shown in fig . [ field_positions ] .",

    "sub - pixel shifts between two images can cause the centre flux in one image ( or in both ) to look like a cosmic ray when the images are compared in the cosmic ray algorithm .",

    "this part of the apparent magnitude range is indeed heavily contaminated by foreground disk stars , which appear as if they are young bulge stars .",

    "further evidence that this may indeed be a separate entity ( the nucleus ? ) is provided by the fact that both luminosity and kinematical models ( eg kent 1992 ) which describe well the outer bulge under - predict the light in the very central part of the galactic bulge . at the position of the sgr - i window , at 3 cobe scale lengths from the galactic centre we are just beginning to pick up the ir bulge .",

    "these results are supported by recent studies of oh / ir stars ( sevenster , et al .",
    "oh / ir stars , which are oxygen - rich , cool giant stars in their final stages of evolution , trace basically all stars with a main - sequence mass of @xmath115 and can be reliably detected through their oh maser emission at 1612 mhz .",
    "this makes them ideal tracers of the underlying stellar population .",
    "they are intermediate age or old , and should therefore be dynamically relaxed and trace the global gravitational potential .",
    "these stars are distributed in the central bulge with a scale height @xmath116 pc ( sevenster et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we also note the fact that star - forming regions such as sgr b exist shows that star - formation is still going on in the galactic bulge on scales of 50 - 100 pc .",
    "this is yet further evidence that we could expect the central parts of the galactic bulge to be more metal - rich than the outer edges of the galactic bulge .",
    "there remains perhaps no more than a semantic distinction between continuing formation of the central disk and the central bulge on such small scale lengths and recent times .    in conclusion ,",
    "both large scale modeling of the dynamics in the bulge and specific tracers show there to be structure in the stellar populations at scales below those of the optical bulge .",
    "the central parts are a highly dissipated self - enriching part of the galaxy which is at least partially young .",
    "we demonstrate how deep images with high spatial resolutions , only available since the advent of hst , enable us to determine the properties of the galactic bulge stellar population(s ) . in this",
    "we have used three measures ;    * number counts - to search for a young stellar population * histograms - to search for a metal - rich population * comparison of ridge lines - to derive metallicities and look for internal differences , i.e. gradients in age and metallicity      * our results are consistent with no significant young stellar population in the bulge , some 500pc , or 2 - 5 scale lengths , from the centre , contrary to some previous studies ; * the galactic bulge has a mean metallicity equal to that of the old disk ; * there is marginal evidence for a central metallicity gradient ; * the colour - magnitude diagram of ngc6553 is complex , requiring care in photometric analyses of this cluster .",

    "<S> the galactic bulge has long been assumed to be a largely old stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> however , some recent studies based on observations with the hst wf / pc-1 and wfpc2 of stars in the galactic bulge have concluded that the old population may not make up more then 30% of the total . </S>",
    "<S> other studies using hst / wfpc2 differential studies of ` bulge ' globular clusters and field stars have found the bulge to be comparable in age to the galactic halo . </S>",
    "<S> a complication in all these studies is the presence of a substantial population of stars which mimic a young bulge population , but which may be , and are often assumed to be , foreground disk stars whose reddening and distance distributions happen to mimic a young bulge turnoff . </S>",
    "<S> we show , using number counts in hst / wfpc2 colour - magnitude diagrams of both field stars in the bulge and of two ` bulge ' and one ` disk ' globular cluster ( ngc6528 , ngc6553 , and ngc5927 ) that the stars interpreted as young in fact are foreground disk stars . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we confirm that the bulk of the bulge field stars in baade s window are old . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a young _ metal - rich _ population can not , however , be ruled out from our data .    </S>",
    "<S> we also test for age and metallicity gradients in the galactic bulge between the two low extinction windows baade s window ( @xmath0=@xmath1=@xmath2 ) and sagittarius - i ( @xmath0=@xmath3=@xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use the colour - magnitude diagram of a metal - rich globular cluster as an empirical isochrone to derive a metallicity difference of @xmath5 dex between baade s window and sgr - i window . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a metallicity gradient of @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> dex / kpc , in agreement with recent near - ir cmd studies . </S>",
    "<S> such a steep gradient , if detected , would require the existence of a short scale length inner component to the bulge , most likely that prominent in the near infra red , which perhaps forms a separate entity superimposed on the larger , optical bulge as observed in baade s window . </S>"
