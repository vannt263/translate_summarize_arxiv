    "a reliable and complete characterization of the polarized cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies is one of the main challenges in observational cosmology , targeted by a large set of ongoing @xcite , being - deployed @xcite or planned @xcite experiments .",
    "cmb ( linear ) polarization is completely described by two stokes parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are mapped over the celestial sphere by cmb experiments . in the harmonic domain",
    ", the polarization field can be described either with help of spin-2 and spin-@xmath14 or gradient , @xmath3 , and curl , @xmath2 , multipoles . from the physics point of view",
    ", the gradient / curl decomposition is more natural as it is directly linked to the cosmological perturbations produced in the primordial universe . indeed ,",
    "for symmetry reasons , scalar perturbations can produce solely @xmath3-mode - like polarization patterns and therefore the @xmath2 component of the polarization field can be viewed as a direct tracer of the primordial gravity waves @xcite and thus as a window onto the primordial universe . due to the presence of a secondary @xmath2-mode contribution generated by the gravitational lensing of the cmb photons by the universe s large scale structure  @xcite ,",
    "such a picture is not fully correct , however it is hoped that the latter signal can be accurately subtracted permitting a recovery of the primordial @xmath2-modes .    in standard cosmology ,",
    "the physics governing photon propagation is parity invariant resulting in vanishing odd parity correlations , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless in the context of the next generation cmb @xmath2-mode experiments , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra will play an important role , both for the data characterization and their scientific interpretation .",
    "this is because on the one hand , these odd - parity cross - spectra are comprehensive , end - to - end , null tests of the presence of instrumental and/or astrophysical systematic effects still present in the data ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as some non - standard cosmological mechanisms could produce nonvanishing odd - parity cross - spectra , their detection could become a smoking gun of such effects with potentially far - reaching consequences for our understanding of the universe .",
    "examples of such mechanisms include a primordial stochastic magnetic field , which generates @xmath1 and @xmath0 correlations , if this magnetic field possesses a helical component @xcite .",
    "similar effects can be obtained due to a rotation of the plane of linear polarization of the cmb photons traveling from the last scattering surface to our detectors .",
    "this could result from either the faraday rotation induced by interaction with background magnetic fields @xcite or interactions with pseudoscalar fields @xcite . in all these circumstances",
    "a robust and reliable @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectrum estimator could be needed to constrain , and potentially correct for , such effects .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate some of the possible extensions of the existing power spectrum estimation methods to incorporate the odd - parity power spectra .",
    "hereafter we work within a framework of the pseudospectrum techniques . in this context",
    "the polarized cmb multipoles can be calculated with the help of either the standard or pure estimators , with the latter specifically designed to suppress ( or to nearly suppress ) @xmath3-to-@xmath2 and @xmath2-to-@xmath3 leakages . in this work we use a specific prescription for calculating those as introduced in @xcite and later elaborated on in @xcite , for some alternatives see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the relative merit of using either the standard or the pure estimates of the pseudo - multipoles has been discussed in the context of the @xmath2-mode power spectra showing that the pure approach leads to smaller error bars @xcite .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the pure estimator by construction removes some spatial modes , referred to hereafter as ambiguous modes , which are the source of the leakage between the two polarization components .",
    "this would unavoidably lead to some information loss , reflected in an increase of the final variance of the estimated quantity , were not for a gain incurred as a result of removal the @xmath3-mode power leaked to the @xmath2-spectrum and residing in the ambiguous modes .",
    "the latter effect offsets the former one at least as long as @xmath17 as indeed is expected for the cmb signal .",
    "consequently , a significant gain in precision is usually observed as compared with the standard estimator , which retains all the modes together with the leaked power . by the same token , for estimating the @xmath3-mode power spectrum the standard approach is expected to be more efficient as this time extra variance due to the power of the @xmath2 modes leaked into @xmath3 is by far subdominant to that resulting from the removal of the ambiguous modes .    the question , whether to include or not the ambiguous modes , and whether to do it consistently or only partially , is less straightforward to answer in the context of the two odd - parity power spectra estimation and has not been addressed to date on either a qualitative or quantitative level .",
    "this is the problem that is at the focus of this work . to address it",
    "hereafter we construct and investigate performance of three alternative @xmath0 pseudospectrum estimators - modes and the pure estimation for the @xmath3-modes .",
    "however , such an alternative is a priori disfavored as a significant amount of information on the @xmath3-modes is lost and the @xmath2-modes still suffer from @xmath3-to-@xmath2 leakage and therefore will not be considered in this work . ] : + @xmath18   _ a standard approach _",
    "@xcite involving the standard pseudoharmonic coefficients for both the signal maps and no explicit correction for the @xmath3-to-@xmath2 leakage ; + @xmath18   _ a pure approach _",
    ", when both sets of the multipoles are pure ; @xcite ; and + @xmath18   _ a hybrid approach _",
    ", where the @xmath3 multipoles are obtained from the standard estimator and the @xmath2 signal from the pure estimator @xcite . + temperature multipoles are always estimated using the standard pseudo - multipole approach , it may therefore appear that there are only two possible estimators for the @xmath1 spectra corresponding to @xmath2 multipoles being either standard or pure .",
    "in fact , the situation is somewhat more complex due to the fact that , as discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : formalismtb ] .",
    ", an unbiased estimation of the @xmath1 spectrum requires treating it together with the corresponding @xmath7 spectrum .",
    "consequently , we arrive again at three types of estimators of possible interest , which mirror the case of the @xmath0 estimators , and are therefore defined by the type of multipoles used for @xmath3 and @xmath2 signals",

    "this is this latter condition , which ensures that the pure estimator typically results in significant improvements over the standard one at least as far as @xmath2-mode power spectra are concerned .",

    "the total number of such _ angular momentum couplings _ is eight as any angular momentum can be of either @xmath3- or @xmath2-type .",
    "each of these couplings can be classified according to its parity : even or odd .",
    "for example , the coupling between @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 does not vanish only for even values of @xmath76 , as it is made of the @xmath77 quantities ( see app .",
    "[ app : gaunt ] ) .",
    "we call such a coupling _ even_. in contrast , the coupling between @xmath73 , @xmath78 and @xmath75 , made of the @xmath79 quantities , is an _ odd coupling _ as it is nonzero only for odd values of @xmath76 .",
    "from this perspective , the pseudo - multipoles can be written using the following matrix notation @xmath80 where both @xmath81 and @xmath82 depend on @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , and @xmath83 if they both have the same arguments .",
    "this classification is helpful during the computation of the pseudo - power spectra as any term involving the product of an odd coupling times an even coupling will vanish .",
    "the parity nature of each coupling is summarized in table [ tab : coupling ] .",
    ".parity classification of the coupling between pseudo - multipoles , cmb multipoles and window function multipoles .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the two types of the pseudo - multipoles defined in the previous section permit us to introduce three different pseudospectrum estimators .",
    "these include _ a standard estimator _ in which both @xmath3 and @xmath2 pseudo - multipoles used to construct pseudo-@xmath19 s are standard ; _ a pure estimator _ in which the @xmath3 and @xmath2 pseudo - multipoles are pure ; and _ a hybrid estimator _ which combines a standard estimate of the @xmath3 pseudo - multipoles with a pure estimate of the @xmath2 pseudo - multipoles .    for each of the three alternatives , the pseudo - power spectra , @xmath84 , are defined as follows @xmath85 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 and @xmath87 stands for the standard and the pure pseudo - multipoles respectively .",
    "because of the limited sky - coverage and pixel dependent weights , these estimators are biased as their average over cmb realizations involves a mixing between different @xmath88-modes and between different polarization type .",
    "those two classes of mixing are encoded in the mode - mode coupling matrices @xmath89 and the unbiased estimator , @xmath90 , is computed by solving the following linear system @xmath91 where @xmath92 stands for the noise contribution to the pseudo - power spectra , _ a priori _ considered as nonzero .",
    "expressions for the different noise biases under the assumption of white noise as well as those for the mode - mode coupling matrix depend on a choice of a specific formalism .",
    "they are discussed in appendices  [ app : noise ] and  [ app : mixingeb ] , respectively , and below we only briefly summarize main properties of the coupling matrices referring the reader for all the details there .      in this formalism , assuming the same window function is used for estimating the @xmath3 and the @xmath2 pseudo - multipoles , the different blocks are related to each other as follows , @xmath93 and @xmath94 their explicit expressions are summarized in eqs . and .",
    "though @xmath95 is smaller than @xmath96 , it can not generally be neglected as it describes the leakage from @xmath3-modes to @xmath2-modes , which has to be corrected for , in particular if the maps to be analyzed cover a tiny amount of the celestial sphere ( see for example fig .",
    "9 of @xcite ) . as shown in app .",
    "[ app : mixingeb ] , the @xmath97 matrix is equal to zero , emphasizing the fact that the @xmath0 cross - spectrum is not coupled to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 auto - spectra .",
    "the main reason for this is that whenever the window functions contains only a @xmath3-component , as is precisely the case in the standard formalism , @xmath3 pseudo - multipoles are evenly coupled to @xmath3 multipoles and oddly coupled to @xmath2 multipoles while the @xmath2 pseudo - multipoles are oddly coupled to @xmath3 multipoles and evenly coupled to @xmath2 multipoles . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath97 block involves product of the even and odd coupling and thus vanishes .",
    "this demonstrates that the @xmath0 cross - spectrum can therefore be treated independently of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra in this formalism .      in the pure formalism ,",
    "the different mode - mode coupling blocks satisfy the same relations as given in eqs . and .",
    "nevertheless their respective expressions are qualitatively and quantitatively different in both these cases , see eqs . and .",
    "first of all , the pure estimation ensures the @xmath95 block be small enough to substantially reduce amount of @xmath3-to-@xmath2 leakage even in the cases of small - sky coverage ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "9 of @xcite ) .",
    "second , unlike the standard case , the four blocks @xmath97 , which couple the @xmath0 cross - spectrum to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 autospectra , may not vanish .",
    "these blocks involve two types of couplings : i ) odd - even couplings corresponding to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 power spectra of the window functions and ii ) even - even and odd - odd couplings via the cross - correlation of the @xmath3-component of the window functions with their @xmath2-component .",
    "though the first type of couplings is identically equal to zero , the second class of couplings does not vanish if the spin-1 and spin-2 windows have a nonvanishing @xmath2-component .",
    "the case of the hybrid formalism is more intricate as it involves the cross - correlation of the pure pseudo - multipoles with the standard pseudo - multipoles .",
    "denoting by @xmath98 and @xmath99 either @xmath3 or @xmath2 , we find that the @xmath100 blocks are equal to the @xmath100 blocks as computed in the standard formalism while the @xmath101 blocks are given by the @xmath101 blocks as derived in the pure formalism . the expression for the @xmath102 blocks",
    "is given by eq . and involves a cross - product of the matrices @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "the formalism developed in the previous section is easily adaptable to the second odd - parity power spectrum , @xmath105 . because of the @xmath3-to-@xmath2 ( and @xmath2-to-@xmath3 ) leakage , the @xmath1 spectrum has to be analyzed with the @xmath7 in a unified framework .",

    "we observe that in the standard and pure formalisms , @xmath109 and @xmath110 as long as the same window functions are used to compute the @xmath3 and @xmath2 multipoles .",
    "however , the off - diagonal blocks , @xmath111 are equal to zero in the standard formalism but may not vanish in the pure one if the spin-1 and spin-2 windows have a nonzero @xmath2-component .",
    "the fundamental reason is that pseudo-@xmath43 are coupled only to the product of the @xmath3-component of the window functions applied to the maps times the @xmath43 via an even coupling while in the standard formalism , @xmath112-pseudo - multipoles are coupled to @xmath113-multipoles via an odd coupling .",
    "however , the pure formalism introduces an additional even coupling of the @xmath112-pseudo - multipoles with the @xmath113-multipoles via the @xmath2-component of the nonzero - spin window functions , which translates into nonvanishing off - diagonal blocks . in the hybrid formalism ,",
    "the @xmath114 and @xmath111 blocks are formally equal to the ones computed in the standard formalism while the @xmath115 and @xmath116 blocks are equal to the ones as computed in the pure formalism .",

    "their relative merit has been extensively discussed in @xcite to show that the pixel - domain optimization scheme proposed in @xcite leads to the lowest variance on the power spectrum estimation .",
    "the underlying strategy to derive such an optimized sky apodization is to search for window functions , @xmath51 , which make the pure pseudo-@xmath19 as close as possible to the optimal , quadratic power - spectrum estimator ( see sec .",
    "v of @xcite ) .",
    "an optimized weighting scheme therefore involves a specific sky apodization for each @xmath88-band where the power spectrum is to be estimated , according to the signal and noise power aliasing in each band .",
    "such an optimization procedure assumes that noise and signal are known . for the noise and @xmath3-modes sufficiently precise assumptions",
    "are usually available , e.g. , @xmath3-mode power spectrum can be recovered precisely enough without any optimization .",
    "though this is not the case with the @xmath2-modes , it can be shown @xcite that the assumptions about the @xmath2-modes power spectrum very weakly affect the results of the power - spectrum estimation using the optimized sky apodization .",
    "this is due to the fact that the optimization process foremost attempts to reduce the @xmath3-to-@xmath2 leakage and then the noise variance and thus no precise @xmath2-mode knowledge is necessary .",
    "we note that in this approach as the derivative relationship is relaxed during the computation , the @xmath2-component of the spin-1 and spin-2 windows becomes nonzero .",
    "therefore , the @xmath117 and @xmath118 blocks of the mode - mode coupling will not vanish .",
    "nevertheless , numerical studies have shown that the @xmath2-component of their spin-1 and spin-2 windows is very small .",
    "as shown in appendix [ app : mixingeb ] , only the _ cross - spectra _ of the @xmath3-component and @xmath2-component of the spin - weighted window functions are involved in the @xmath117 and @xmath118 while the _ autospectra _ of both @xmath3- and @xmath2-component of those window functions enter in the other blocks . as a consequence",
    ", we expect the @xmath117 and @xmath118 blocks of the mode - mode coupling matrix to be much smaller than the other blocks .",
    "other options for the apodizations considered to date @xcite include i ) analytic window functions , and ii ) harmonic - based optimized window functions . in these cases ,",
    "the spin-1 and spin-2 windows are computed by taking numerically the derivative of the spin-0 window . as a consequence ,",

    "<S> we discuss methods for estimating @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy maps covering limited sky area . </S>",
    "<S> such odd - parity correlations are expected to vanish whenever parity is not broken . </S>",
    "<S> as this is indeed the case in the standard cosmologies , any evidence to the contrary would have a profound impact on our theories of the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> such correlations could also become a sensitive diagnostic of some particularly insidious instrumental systematics . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we introduce three different unbiased estimators based on the so - called standard and pure pseudo - spectrum techniques and later assess their performance by means of extensive monte carlo simulations performed for different experimental configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a hybrid approach combining a pure estimate of @xmath2-mode multipoles with a standard one for @xmath3-mode ( or @xmath4 ) multipoles , leads to the smallest error bars for both @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 respectively ) spectra as well as for the three other polarization - related angular power spectra ( _ i.e. _ @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , if both @xmath3 and @xmath2 multipoles are estimated using the pure technique the loss of precision for the @xmath0 spectrum is not larger than @xmath8% . moreover , for the experimental configurations considered here , the statistical uncertainties due to sampling variance and instrumental noise of the pseudo - spectrum estimates is at most a factor @xmath9 for @xmath10 , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 spectra and a factor @xmath11 for @xmath6 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 spectra , higher than the most optimistic fisher estimate of the variance . </S>"
