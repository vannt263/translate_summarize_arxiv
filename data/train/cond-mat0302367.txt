    "<S> in order to investigate the origin of the until now unaccounted excess noise and to minimize the uncontrollable phenomena at the transition in x - ray microcalorimeters we have developed superconducting transition - edge sensors into an edgeless geometry , the so - called corbino disk ( cortes ) , with superconducting contacts in the centre and at the outer perimeter . the measured rms current noise and its spectral density can be modeled as resistance noise resulting from fluctuations near the equilibrium superconductor - normal metal boundary .    at present , the most sensitive energy - dispersive x - ray detector is the transition - edge sensor ( tes ) microcalorimeter , a thermal detector operated typically at a bath temperature below 100 mk @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the device consists of an x - ray absorber ( bi , au , cu being the most common materials ) , thermally coupled to a tes superconducting film with a critical temperature @xmath0 mk . </S>",
    "<S> the tes film is typically a proximity - coupled bilayer , e.g. , ti / au , mo / cu , or mo / au . a common detector geometry is a square tes film , covered completely , or in some cases partially by the x - ray absorber film . </S>",
    "<S> the tes film - absorber combination is located on a thermally isolating si@xmath1n@xmath2 film , micromachined to a bulk si substrate which acts as the heat sink . </S>",
    "<S> wires with a @xmath3 much higher than that of the tes film are used to connect the detector to the bias circuit . </S>",
    "<S> the device is connected to a constant voltage bias , and the current through the sensor is measured with a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of operation of these devices has been well developed , but is not complete as the tes microcalorimeters consistently do not achieve the energy resolution predicted by the models . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the tes microcalorimeters fail to reach the expected energy resolution in calorimetry , especially when the deposited heat drives the device through a large part of its superconducting transition . secondly , most tess exhibit noise in excess of the sum of the commonly recognized noise components : thermal fluctuation noise arising from the thermal link between the tes and the heat sink ( tfn ) , johnson noise ( jn ) , and squid ( read - out ) noise ( sn ) . </S>",
    "<S> this letter presents a simple model which explains this discrepancy in the detector subject to our study .    in the square devices , edges parallel to the current become crucial for the device performance . </S>",
    "<S> firstly thickness variations resulting from underetching or imperfect deposition of the tes bilayer lead to spatial @xmath3 variations . </S>",
    "<S> secondly the edges have also proven to give rise to flux creep noise with the higher concentration of trapping centres due to local defects which can be observable at certain values of the bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> a solution to overcome edge effects is to deposit thick normal metal banks over the edges . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity effect of the thick normal metal reduces the critical temperature of the edges well below that of bulk of the tes film , resulting in well - defined edges @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another way of removing the edges is to use a corbino disk geometry , in which a current source is placed in the apex of the annular tes film , and another superconducting contact is placed to the outer circumference of the tes film . here </S>",
    "<S> the current density is proportional to @xmath4 , which results in a well defined phase boundary at certain distance @xmath5 from the centre of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> a corbino geometry tes , or the cortes , is shown in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cortes_fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the central contact is provided by a superconducting ground plane , covering the entire sensor . by this </S>",
    "<S> we ensure a truly cylindrical symmetry and a homogeneous current distribution with a concentric current return .    </S>",
    "<S> the devices are fabricated on a double - side nitridized , 525 @xmath6 m thick si wafer . </S>",
    "<S> free standing si@xmath1n@xmath2 membranes with a thickness of 250 nm are fabricated by wet etching of the si . </S>",
    "<S> the cortes layers are patterned by e - beam lithography , combined with uhv e - beam evaporation and lift - off . </S>",
    "<S> the wiring layers consist of a circular nb outer contact , and a nb ground plane , which contacts the tes film through an opening in an underlying insulator .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to a square tes , the phase boundary in the cortes evolves controllably from the centre of the disk and moves radially outwards with increasing current . </S>",
    "<S> this can be modelled by a heat transfer model , similar to that used to describe suspended nb microbridge bolometers and hot electron mixers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> assuming radial symmetry , the current density is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the current , @xmath9 is the radial distance from the centre of the disk , and @xmath10 is the film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the resistance of the cortes is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the radius of the central superconducting contact . </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state behaviour can be modeled by first noting that the heat transport within the sensor is completely dominated by the metal films . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal conductivity in the superconducting region ( at radii @xmath13 ) is given approximately by @xmath14 $ ] where @xmath15 is of the order of the energy gap @xmath16 of the superconductor , @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath18 is the normal state thermal conductivity , @xmath19 is the normal state electrical resistivity and @xmath20 v@xmath21k@xmath22 is the lorentz number @xcite . here we assume validity of wiedemann - franz law . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal conductivity of the 250 nm thick sin membrane is given by @xmath23 @xcite , and at temperatures present in the system ( 20 mk - 150 mk ) it is typically three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> as the thicknesses of the sin and the tes are comparable , the problem reduces to two dimensions , and due to symmetry further to one dimension . at this point </S>",
    "<S> we neglect the temperature gradient within the normal state part , as the gradient over the superconducting annulus and especially over the surrounding membrane are much larger . </S>",
    "<S> in the superconducting part we require a heat balance @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the dissipated bias power , with @xmath27 the applied voltage across the sensor and @xmath28 the radius of the cortes outer edge at temperature @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar equation can be written for the heat transport in the membrane but now the integration is carried out from @xmath28 to @xmath30 , the radius of the `` equivalent '' circular membrane to the square one with a pitch of @xmath31 , and in temperature from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , the latter being the bath temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a solution for @xmath32 , which can be inserted into the heat balance equation of the superconducting region . </S>",
    "<S> this can then be numerically solved for @xmath34 from which one obtains @xmath35\\}$ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we first carried out an @xmath36 measurement in a dilution refrigerator measuring the resistance @xmath37 of the cortes using a 4-wire ac method with a current bias of 5 @xmath38a as a function of @xmath33 . from this , @xmath39 mk was obtained . </S>",
    "<S> next , we measured a set current - voltage @xmath40 $ ] curves using voltage bias with a source impedance @xmath41 of 7 m@xmath42 , and a squid ammeter . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cortes_fig1 ] , together with a fit using the model above . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath43 curve is insensitive to the external magnetic field thanks to the nb groundplane . </S>",
    "<S> the fitting parameter is @xmath15 in the the superconducting region . </S>",
    "<S> best fit yields @xmath44 , which is a reasonable value , somewhat smaller than the bcs gap , @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp corner present in the fit is due to the fact that the model assumes a step - wise transition with zero width , whereas the actual transition is smooth , as seen in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : alphas ] . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : alphas ] shows the steepness of the transition , @xmath46 , as a function of @xmath27 measured at different bath temperatures . in all the curves @xmath47 has a maximum value of about 300 . </S>",
    "<S> this is one order of magnitude higher than in typical ( square ) microcalorimeters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the high @xmath47 is attributed mainly to the self - screening property of the ground plane and the well defined edge conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> the noise characteristics of the cortes were measured as a function of the bias voltage . both noise spectra and the rms current noise between 100 hz and 20 khz were determined . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic thermal time constant of the cortes with heat capacity @xmath48 and thermal conductance to the bath of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , was determined from pulse response to be about 1.2 ms . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the rms measurements are mainly sensitive to noise which is not suppressed by the electro - thermal feedback ( frequencies above @xmath51=130 hz ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method allows us to investigate the current noise against the operating point . </S>",
    "<S> when biased in the operating region ( @xmath52 1 @xmath38v ) , the noise in the cortes can not be accounted for by assuming contributions from tfn , jn and sn , as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cortes_fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the discrepancy can not be explained by including an internal tfn ( itfn ) @xcite arising from the finite internal thermal impedance of the tes film . </S>",
    "<S> the itfn is calculated as in ref . @xcite and it is proportional to @xmath53 exhibiting a peak at a bias corresponding to the maximum value of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the itfn does not explain the noise at lower bias voltages where the noise is more than a decade larger than what we would be expect just by assuming contributions from the previously known terms .    </S>",
    "<S> according to the ginzburg - landau theory , the free energy difference between equilibrium superconducting and normal states of a volume @xmath42 in the absence of any fields is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 ^ 2 $ ] . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 is the electron mass , and @xmath58 @xmath59ev@xmath60 is the density of states at fermi level for ti , @xmath61 @xmath38 m is the bcs coherence length and @xmath62 100  is the mean free path determined from the normal state resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature gradient within the normal section can be solved by @xmath63^{-2}$ ] using boundary conditions @xmath64 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations of @xmath66 with free energy variations @xmath67 are possible and they correspond to large fluctuating volumes @xmath68 of the condensate near @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature gradient restricts the fluctuations to an annular volume at the outer perimeter of the normal state part , where the coherence length @xmath69 diverges . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the radial extent of fluctuations , @xmath70 , assuming that order parameter fluctuates between zero and its equilibrium value at a distance @xmath70 away from the equilibrium phase boundary within a volume @xmath71 : @xmath72 here we have assumed that @xmath73 can be approximated by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 represents the effective radial temperature gradient at the phase boundary . the solution for the temperature profile yields @xmath76 , where the numerical factor @xmath77 is used as the only fitting parameter which describes the reduction of the lorentz number close to the boundary due to the presence of cooper pairs . solving for @xmath70 and inserting the equations for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation in boundary radius is given by @xmath80^{-1/3}$ ] .    in order to obtain the spectral density of the critical fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the relaxation time of a fluctuation is given by @xmath81^{-1}=\\hbar \\pi [ 8 k_{\\rm b } t_{\\rm c } \\gamma \\delta r ] ^{-1}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the equivalent noise bandwidth is @xmath82 , and the resulting spectral density of the resistance fluctuations is given by @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be considered as a white noise source within the bandwidth of our measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the current noise arising from resistance fluctuations is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 corrects for non ideal voltage bias . </S>",
    "<S> the resistance fluctuations are suppressed by the etf in a similar fashion as jn . </S>",
    "<S> more explicitly , the fluctuation superconductivity noise ( fsn ) component is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the loop gain of the negative electrothermal feedback , and @xmath89 is the effective time constant of the sensor . as figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cortes_fig4 ] and [ fig : spectra ] show , the noise can be accurately modelled through out the transition and over a wide range in frequency with only one fit parameter , @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> we should , however , keep in mind that the crude definition of @xmath70 in our model may simply be compensated by this fitting parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> when fsn dominates over the other noise terms , the fwhm energy resolution of a calorimeter can be estimated from the noise equivalent power nep@xmath91 where @xmath92 is the current responsivity of the sensor @xcite , @xmath93 in the measured device , @xmath94 has a minimum value of @xmath950.1 ev at @xmath96 @xmath38v ( where @xmath47 is at maximum ) and it increases to 29 ev at @xmath97 @xmath38v . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the energy resolution of tes microcalorimeters degrades significantly if biased at a voltage below that corresponding to maximum of @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have fabricated and analyzed an idealized transition - edge sensor in which edge - effects are excluded . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical steady state model has been developed which shows good agreement with the measured @xmath43 curve . </S>",
    "<S> the cortes is insensitive to external magnetic fields due to a current carrying nb ground plane . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath47 remains above 300 even when biased with constant voltage bias . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the previously unexplained extra noise originates from thermal fluctuations of the phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the same noise mechanism is present in all types of superconducting transition - edge sensors @xcite , but the effect might not be observable in some cases depending on the way the phase boundaries configure themselves .    this work has been supported by the academy of finland under the finnish centre of excellence programme 2000 - 2005 ( project no . 44875 , nuclear and condensed matter programme at jyfl ) , and by the finnish antares space research programme under the _ high energy astrophysics and space astronomy _ ( hesa ) consortium . </S>",
