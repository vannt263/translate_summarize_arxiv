    "the arrival of every new set of observational data has so far reconfirmed the current cosmic acceleration , which in turn poses to cosmology a fundamental task of identifying and unveiling the cause of such a phenomenon . as is well known , in the context of einstein s",
    "general relativity , this phenomenon is directly associated with the existence of new fields in high energy physics , the so - called dark energy or quintessence ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent reviews ) .    following this route , the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) , i.e.",
    ", the ratio of its pressure to its energy density , @xmath3 , has become one of the most searched numbers nowadays in theoretical and observational cosmology .",
    "this is so because if one could set ( for some fundamental principle or observational result ) @xmath4 to be constant and exactly -1 , then there would be a great probability of identifying the dark energy with the vacuum state of all existing fields in the universe , i.e. , the cosmological constant ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "similarly , if a value @xmath6 is unambiguously found , then one could not only rule out @xmath5 but also seriously think of the dark pressure responsible for the cosmic acceleration as the potential energy density associated with a dynamical scalar field @xmath7   still leads to two different routes , i.e. , either the so - called _ quintessence _",
    "if @xmath8 @xcite or _ phantom _ fields if @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "both cases violate the strong energy condition @xmath10 , but the latter goes even further and also violates the null energy condition @xmath11 @xcite . ] .    in practice , at least three different approaches could be considered in order to find @xmath12 from observations .",
    "the first and most direct one is to solve the scalar field equation for a particular theory .",
    "however , clearly such a procedure can not provide a model - independent parameter space to be compared with the observational data .",
    "another possibility is to build a functional form for @xmath13 in terms of its current value @xmath14 and of its time - dependence @xmath15 that avoids undesirable ( and unphysical ) behaviours in the past , present and future evolution  @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of eos parameterizations have been discussed in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs . therein ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , any functional form for @xmath13 may in principle limit or even bias the physical interpretation of the data so that a third , parameter - free approach , such as binned eos , decomposition into orthorgonal basis and principal component analysis , has also been considered as an alternative to eos parameterization  @xcite .",
    "although promising , it is fair to say that such a procedure does not solve all the existing problems and may also introduce new ones , such as model dependence and uncertain signal - to - noise criteria ( see @xcite for more on this subject ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we follow the second approach discussed above and consider a new parameterization for the dark energy eos , which is characterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath2 . in the limits @xmath16 ( -1 , 0 , +",
    "1 ) , this new eos form fully generalizes three of the most common eos parameterizations investigated in the literature whereas @xmath17 @xmath18 it admits a much wider range of solutions . among these solutions ,",
    "many of the different cosmological models that have been proposed to explain dark energy as well as new ones can be incorporated into the functional form here proposed .",
    "we emphasize that such flexibility and generality are particularly important to our research on @xmath13 not only because they increase the range of possibilities to be tested but also because in principle they may reduce the possibility for misleading results an incorrect eos parameterization can produce .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in secs .",
    "ii and iii we discuss some features of this new eos parameterization and investigate its influence on the evolution of the dark energy  dark matter ratio and on the epoch of cosmic acceleration . in sec .",
    "iii we also test the viability of the parameterization proposed by investigating constraints on the 2-dimensional @xmath19 and @xmath20 planes and on the 3-dimensional @xmath21 space from distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and measurements of the hubble expansion @xmath22 at low and intermediary redshifts .",
    "we end this paper by summarizing our main results in sec .",
    "let us start by presenting some of the most investigated eos parameterizations : @xmath23 where @xmath14 is the current value of the eos parameter , and @xmath24 ( p = p1 , p2 , p3 ) are free parameters quantifying the time - dependence of the dark energy eos , which must be adjusted by the observational data .",
    "note that the eos associated with @xmath5 can be always recovered by taking @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see also @xcite for other parameterizations ) .",
    "0.1 in    the taylor expansion p1 was suggested in refs .",
    "observational constraints on p1 were firstly studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by using sne ia data , gravitational lensing statistics and globular clusters ages and also in  @xcite that investigated limits to this parameterization from future sne ia experiments .",
    "as commented in @xcite , p1 is a good approximation for most quintessence models out to redshift of a few and it is exact for models where the eos is a constant or changing slowly .",
    "p1 , however , has serious problems to explain high-@xmath27 observations since it blows up at @xmath28 as @xmath29 for values of @xmath30 .",
    "the empirical fit p2 was introduced by efstathiou  @xcite who argued that for a wide class of potentials associated with dynamical scalar field models the evolution of @xmath13 at @xmath31 is well approximated by p2 .",
    "p3 was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite aiming at solving undesirable behaviours of p1 at high-@xmath27 .",
    "according to @xcite , this parameterization is a good fit for many theoretically conceivable scalar field potentials , as well as for small recent deviations from a pure cosmological constant behaviour ( @xmath32 ) .    to extend the eos parametrizations above ,",
    "let us consider the following time - dependent function :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the cosmological scale factor and we have set its present value @xmath35 ( throughout this paper both subscript and superscript 0 will denote present values ) . from the above expressions , it is straightforward to show that the eos parameterizations given by eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) are fully recovered in the limits : @xmath36 where we have used the equality @xmath37 to obtain the limit for p2 .",
    "this amounts to saying that the introduction of the new parameter @xmath2 is equivalent to insert the eos parameterizations ( p1)-(p3 ) in a more general framework that admits a wider and new range of cosmological solutions ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "since the above parameterizations represent separately conserved components , one can show from the energy conservation law [ @xmath39 that the ratio @xmath40 evolves as @xmath41\\;.\\ ] ] some special cases of the above expression are :    [ 101 ] @xmath42,\\,\\,\\mbox{if}\\,\\,\\,\\beta=-1 , \\\\",

    "\\nonumber   \\\\ f_{\\rm{p3 } } = a^{-3(1+w_0+w_3)}\\exp\\big[3w_3\\big(a-1\\big ) \\big],\\,\\,\\mbox{if}\\,\\,\\,\\beta=1 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from eq .",
    "( [ dedensity ] ) , some cases of interest relating the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath43 and @xmath2 may be obtained :    1 .",
    "@xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) : at early times the dark energy is a subdominant component if @xmath46 .",
    "2 .   @xmath47 and @xmath48 : at early times the dark energy always dominates over the other material components . 3 .",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath49 : at early times the dark energy density vanishes .    to better visualize the cases discussed above , we show in figs .",
    "1a and 1b the ratio @xmath50 as a function of @xmath27 for some selected values of @xmath2 , @xmath26 and @xmath51 .",
    "two symmetric values of @xmath43 are considered , i.e. , 0.2 ( fig .",
    "1a ) and -0.2 ( fig .",
    "1b ) and the corresponding value of @xmath2 is displayed right below the curve .",
    "we observe that , for these particular combinations of @xmath14 and @xmath43 , almost the entire range of @xmath52 solutions ( which includes p2 and p3 ) are well - behaved   for @xmath53 . in general , for @xmath44 and @xmath49 , @xmath54 as @xmath55 . ]",
    ". as expected , for @xmath56 ( @xmath48 in general ) @xmath57 parameterizations present undesirable behavior due to the exponential term in eq .",
    "( 4a ) .",
    "we also note that @xmath58 is flexible enough to incorporate into it other dark energy scenarios .",
    "for example , models well approximated by p3 ( or , equivalently , @xmath59 ) with @xmath60 are clearly particular examples of @xmath58 .",
    "this is the case of the linear potential scenario of the type @xmath61 studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and also of the so - called _ mirage _ @xmath5 model of ref .",
    "@xcite . still in the class of thawing scalar field models",
    ", the dynamics of the pseudo - nambu goldstone boson ( pngb ) model  @xcite , whose potential is given by @xmath62 , can be approximated by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is inversely related to the symmetry scale @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "this three - parameter eos can be incorporated into @xmath58 by redefining @xmath66 .",
    "a similar identification can also be made to the class of thawing models studied in ref .",
    "@xcite whose potential is described by @xmath67 $ ] and eos given exactly by @xmath68 .",
    "clearly , @xmath58 can reproduce this latter @xmath69 function by redefining @xmath70 with the constraint @xmath71 ( we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for a complete analysis of several models discussed here and others that may potentially be described by @xmath58 ) .",
    "for example , let us take the case of the model @xmath72 discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is clearly a particular case of @xmath58 when @xmath73 . ] .    finally , the friedmann equation for our generalized @xmath74 model is written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are , respectively , the current values of the hubble , matter and curvature density parameters .",
    "in order to study the influence of the parameter @xmath2 on the epoch of cosmic acceleration , we first derive the deceleration parameter , @xmath81 where @xmath82 . the transition redshift @xmath83 , at which the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration , can be obtained from the following expression @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86\\exp\\left[{\\frac{3w_{\\beta}}{\\beta}}\\left(\\frac{y^{-\\beta } - 1}{\\beta}\\right)\\right].\\ ] ] as one may easily check , for values of @xmath26 and @xmath87 , eq .",
    "( [ zx ] ) reduces to the well - known standard expression @xmath88^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "figure 2 shows the transition redshift @xmath83 as a function of @xmath2 [ eq . ( [ zx ] ) ] by assuming @xmath26 and @xmath89 .",
    "four cases are shown : two in which @xmath43 takes positive values ( 0.5 and 1.0 ) and two in which @xmath49 ( -0.5 and -1.0 ) .",
    "note that , the more negative the value of @xmath2 the lower ( higher ) the transition redshift for negative ( positive ) values of @xmath43 .",
    "the horizontal lines stand for the interval @xmath90 , which corresponds to @xmath91 of the value for @xmath83 given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "0.1 in      the new parameter @xmath2 opens the possibility for a multitude of new cosmological solutions for different combinations of @xmath14 , @xmath43 and @xmath2 . in this section",
    "we investigate observational bounds on the parametric spaces @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath92 from a statistical analysis involving four classes of cosmological observations .    motivated by inflation and the recent results of the cmb power spectrum  @xcite we assume from now on spatial flatness ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "we use the most recent compilation of distance measurements to sne ia , the so - called constitution set ( cs )  @xcite of 397 sne ia .",
    "this sne ia sample covers a redshift range from @xmath94 to @xmath95 , including 139 sne ia at @xmath96 , and constitutes the largest sne ia luminosity distance sample currently available .",
    "we also use cmb and bao data to help diminish the degeneracy between the dark energy parameters @xmath14 , @xmath43 and @xmath2 . for the cmb ,",
    "we use only the measurement of the cmb shift parameter  @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the redshift of the last scattering surface .",
    "the bao parameter is given by  @xcite @xmath99 where the sdss value is @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the typical redshift of the sdss sample and @xmath102^{1/3}$ ] is the dilation scale , defined in terms of the comoving distance to @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath104 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the value of @xmath105 is obtained from the data in the context of the @xmath5cdm model , and can be considered a good approximation only for models whose dark energy contribution at early times is not very large @xcite .",
    "therefore , since for values of @xmath47 and @xmath106 @xmath58 gives rise to early dark energy models , we must have in mind that the inclusion of bao data ( as well as the cmb shift parameter ) rigorously limits the range of the parameter space considered in the analysis .",
    "finally , we also use 9 determinations of the hubble parameter as a function of redshift , as given in ref .",
    "the use of these data to constrain cosmological models seems to be interesting because , differently from distance measures , the hubble parameter is not integrated over ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "thus , in our statistical analysis we minimize the function @xmath107 , which takes into account all the data sets discussed above .",
    "0.1 in    0.1 in      figures 3 shows the parametric spaces @xmath19 and @xmath108 that arise from the joint analysis described above . as expected , we note that similarly to what happens with most of the time - dependent eos parameterizations the current observational bounds on @xmath43 and @xmath2 are quite weak since they appear as the argument of the exponential term in the energy density [ eq . ( [ dedensity ] ) ] . due to the cmb shift estimate @xmath109 at high-@xmath27 , we see from panel ( 3b ) that the observational data are compatible with the class of @xmath57 models predominantly for values of @xmath49 , which is compatible with the cases of interest discussed in sec .",
    "ii and also with the @xmath110 -@xmath27 history shown in fig .",
    "( 1a)-(1b ) .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "4 contours of @xmath111 in the 3-dimensional parametric space @xmath92 , using all data sets .",
    "the contours are drawn for @xmath112 and 8.02 ( corresponding , respectively , to 1@xmath113 and 2@xmath113 for 3 parameters ) .",
    "in particular , for the combination of data discussed earlier , the best - fit occurs for values of @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 with @xmath117 ( @xmath118 where @xmath119 stands for degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we note that , when the cmb shift parameter is not considered in the @xmath120 analysis [ sne ia + bao + h(@xmath27 ) ] , the best - fit for @xmath2 changes considerably to @xmath121 ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) .",
    "this difference in the results with and without the cmb shift estimate @xmath109 seems to be in agreement with a recent analysis for p3 discussed in ref .",
    "in principle , to check the validity of a model or a theory , it is interesting by several reasons to insert it in a more general framework .",
    "this not only brings to light new sets of solutions but also may provide a more accurate consistency check to the original model . in this paper , a general framework for a class of eos parameterization ( p1)-(p3 ) , quantified by a dimensionless parameter @xmath2 , has been proposed and some of its cosmological consequences studied . as an interesting consequence , we have shown that between ( and beyond ) p2 ( @xmath124 ) and p3 ( @xmath125 ) , there is a family of @xmath126 solutions , whose behaviour seems to be compatible with current observational data . although a reasonably precise estimate for @xmath2 ( as well as for @xmath43 ) can not be extracted from current data , we believe that the next generation of dark energy experiments dedicated to this issue [ mainly those measuring the expansion history from high-@xmath27 sne ia , baryon oscillations , and weak gravitational lensing distortion by foreground galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) will probe cosmology with sufficient accuracy to decide which ( if any ) interval of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath2 is preferable from observational viewpoint ( see also @xcite for a discussion on some eos parameterizations and possible constraints on their parameters from future sne ia , cmb and weak lensing experiments ) .",
