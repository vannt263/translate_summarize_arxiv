    "today , many undergraduate students majoring in physics attend introductory courses on elementary particle physics .",
    "this is only possible thanks to excellent textbooks such as the one by griffiths @xcite , who undertook the task of presenting this subject to students lacking a quantum field theory background . at the same time",
    ", this audience receives a lot of qualitative information concerning advanced subjects such as asymptotic freedom , phase transitions , symmetry breaking and restoration through serious popular books @xcite , articles @xcite and the web @xcite .",
    "many times , these issues are discussed in conjunction with cosmological phase transitions , fascinating students . very often , popular articles covering particle physics refer to quarks as having a bare mass as well as an effective mass @xcite .",
    "these topics also appear in advanced undergraduate courses , such as particle physics , nuclear physics as well as solid state physics .    as far as elementary particle physics is concerned",
    ", students will learn that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks are intrinsically very light , but within the confines of a hadron their effective mass is much greater @xcite .",
    "in a typical solid state physics course it will be discussed that an electron , moving inside a solid , will respond in a different way to an externally applied force than it would outside the solid .",
    "therefore , due to the interactions of the electron with the lattice , its mass assumes different values inside ( effective mass ) and outside ( bare mass ) the solid @xcite .",
    "the same concepts can also appear in a nuclear physics course where the students will learn that the neutron mass inside a dense neutron star has a different value than it has at zero density .",
    "these concepts may also be introduced in alternative ways , such as the one presented by mattuck @xcite , where newton s second law of motion is used to define a classical quasi - particle propagator . however , although succeeding in giving the notion of bare and effective masses , this presentation is formulated in terms of a many - body system .",
    "an excellent article , by kittel @xcite , also treats the effective mass at the undergraduate level but it is mainly written to be used in conjunction with a course in solid state physics .    here",
    "i will present an alternative approach , which can be discussed when one reviews newton s laws of motion in a classical mechanics course @xcite for junior - level undergraduates .",
    "many of the students attending this type of course are familiar , at least from a qualitative point of view , with terms such as effective mass and asymptotic freedom . in this work",
    ", i propose that these topics be discussed in a more formal way through standard applications of newton s second law of motion .",
    "it is notorious that students , eager to see modern physics in action , do not see much fun in treating this classical problem and this paper has been written to allow the instructor , presenting the subject , to make a stimulating digression in order to introduce ideas currently used in modern physics . my aim is to set up , within the newtonian formalism , equations which will help undergraduate students to have a mathematical , rather than conceptual , view of non - trivial issues concerning modern theories . at the same time , this simple presentation could be reviewed in more advanced courses , such as quantum field theory , as a preparation to the study of the renormalization programme . in this case",
    ", students will also profit from reading refs . @xcite before tackling the subject .    in the next section ,",
    "i will use newton s second law of motion to define the relation between bare mass and effective mass .",
    "i will discuss two cases starting with the notion of added mass , which occurs in fluid dynamics .",
    "next , i will consider a block sliding over a surface in the presence of friction to set up an equation which partially captures some features related to the concept of effective mass in modern theories .",
    "contrary to the equation obtained in the fluid dynamics case , this equation can not be considered a true equation for the effective mass . nevertheless , when used with care",
    ", it can be useful to discuss issues related to quantum field theories . in this same section",
    ", i will suppose that parameters such as the density and the coefficient of kinetic friction change with the temperature .",
    "this will allow us to plot the effective mass in terms of the temperature , opening the possibility of discussing issues related to chiral symmetry breaking / restoration in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , among others .",
    "a short conceptual review of bare and effective masses in quantum field theories will be presented in section iii .",
    "the equation corresponding to the sliding block case will be rewritten as a series , in a diagrammatic way , in section iv .",
    "finally , a brief comment on scale dependence which hints at the renormalization group equations is made in section v. the paper is written in a way that allows the instructor to adapt the material to be covered according to the background of her / his students . at a more introductory level , sections ii.a and iii will suffice to introduce the notion of bare and effective masses .",
    "sections ii.b , iv , and v , can be left for students who are getting familiar with the language of quantum field theories .",
    "section ii.b must be presented with care to avoid confusions regarding newton s second law of motion . to substantiate the discussion carried out in section iii ,",
    "the students should be asked to read chapter 2 ( especially sec .",
    "2.3 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , which gives a qualitative overview concerning issues such as asymptotic freedom . at the same time",
    ", the instructor should encourage more advanced students , such as the ones attending a course on particle physics , to perform some of the evaluations presented in refs .",
    "in this section we will analyze newton s second law of motion applied to two independent situations which will be useful to introduce ideas related to the concepts of bare mass and effective mass . in each case",
    "we shall see how an external paramater such as the temperature affects the effective mass .",
    "this procedure will allow a better understanding of the qcd chiral transition problem which will be briefly addressed in subsection iii.c .",
    "consider a body of mass @xmath2 and volume @xmath3 immersed in some static fluid whose density is @xmath4 as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the body is initially at rest so that drag can be neglected .",
    "the dynamics of the situation shown in figure [ fig1 ] can be studied using newton s second law of motion @xcite , @xmath5 , where the linear momentum is defined as @xmath6 , with @xmath2 representing the mass and @xmath7 the velocity .",
    "now , assuming that @xmath2 is constant , one can write the more restrictive relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the acceleration , @xmath10 .",
    "defined in this way , via newton s second law of motion , @xmath2 represents the inertial mass , the characteristic that relates the sum of external forces on the body to the resulting acceleration .",
    "this inertial mass is indistinguishable from the gravitational mass , which is defined in terms of the gravitational force it produces . in this paper",
    ", this definition of mass will be sufficient for our purposes as a working concept but readers seeking to get more insight in the concept of mass will find the recent work by roche @xcite very illuminating .",
    "note , from figure [ fig1 ] that an applied force @xmath11 along the horizontal axis ( @xmath12 ) will accelerate not only the body but also part of the fluid , with mass @xmath13 , corresponding to the body s volume @xcite . let us suppose that buoyance equals the body s weight so there is no force along @xmath14 .",
    "then , newton s second law of motion yields    @xmath15    where we have defined @xmath16 .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 is called the added mass while the dimensionless parameter @xmath18 relates to the body s geometry @xcite ( e.g. , @xmath19 for a sphere and @xmath20 for an ellipsoid moving  end on \" with the major axis twice the minor axis ) . the added mass term will become more familiar by recalling , for example , that it appears easier to accelerate our hands in the air than in a bathtube .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", a numerical value for @xmath2 can be obtained by measuring @xmath21 using , as inputs , the values for @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath18 . in accordance with our supposition that @xmath2 is constant",
    ", the type of experiment displayed in figure [ fig1 ] will always generate the same numerical value for @xmath2 irrespective of the input parameter values .",
    "therefore , @xmath2 is also the value which would be measured in the ideal situation where the body is in the vacuum ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "let us call the constant @xmath2 the bare mass .",
    "at the same time , the presence of the fluid can be treated as an effective increase in the mass of the body for the purpose of determining the acceleration and therefore we can call @xmath23 the effective mass",
    "( [ added ] ) explicitly shows the main difference between bare and effective masses .",
    "namely , when an interaction is present , the value @xmath2 changes to the value @xmath24 , where @xmath13 represents interactions . in this case one can also say that the bare mass has been dressed up by the interactions between the body and the surrounding static fluid .    to illustrate the role of @xmath23 in classical physics",
    "let us consider a spherical balloon whose volume is @xmath3 filled with a gas with density @xmath25 where @xmath4 is the air s density .",
    "the balloon is initially at rest so that the forces acting on it are its weight , @xmath26 ( neglecting the mass of the material of which the balloon is made ) , and the buoyant force , which corresponds to the weight of the displaced air , @xmath27 . in this case",
    ", the effective mass is @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "all forces act along the vertical axis and newton s second law reads @xmath30 an easy computation shows that the upward acceleration is given by @xmath31 which looks more reasonable than the value @xmath32 obtained by neglecting the added mass term , @xmath13 .",
    "this illustrates the fact that the effective mass , which takes into account interactios with the medium , produces more realistic results .",
    "now , let us see how the temperature can change the effective mass of the immersed body so that analogies with modern theories can be further explored .",
    "( [ added ] ) clearly shows that @xmath23 increases linearly with the fluid s density , @xmath4 .",
    "however , the temperature ( @xmath33 ) also affects the added mass @xmath34 since @xmath18 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 can change with @xmath33 . for",
    "the sake of simplicity one can suppose that the body s shape and volume remain constant for a certain range of temperatures while the fluid s density changes .",
    "for example , consider the fluid to behave as an ideal gas whose equation of state is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pressure and @xmath37 is the gas constant . considering the case where the pressure is constant the equation of state can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a reference value at @xmath40 . then , using @xmath41 one can write @xmath42 \\,\\,.\\ ] ] for numerical purposes , let us set @xmath43 ( sphere ) and @xmath44 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows how @xmath45 decreases with the temperature .",
    "this simple example will help us to understand , in section iii , a similar phenomenon , known as the chiral transition , which arises in qcd where the effective mass of the quarks decreases with the temperature @xcite .",
    "let us now consider a block of mass @xmath46 , sliding over a flat surface , in the presence of friction and absence of air drag , as shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the forces acting on the body are its weight , @xmath47 , the normal force , @xmath48 , an applied force @xmath49 and a kinetic frictional force , @xmath50 . for the sake of the discussion to be carried out at the end of this subsection",
    ", the figure also shows a thermometer which records the temperature of the surface .",
    "the forces can be decomposed in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath14 components by choosing @xmath12 parallel to the surface .",
    "since there is no acceleration along @xmath14 , one can write @xmath51 . then , along @xmath12 , one gets @xmath52 where @xmath53 . the dimensionless quantity @xmath54 represents the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the surface .",
    "if we express the applied force in terms of the body s weight as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a dimensionless quantity , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) can be written as @xmath57 which shows that to have non null acceleration to the right one must have @xmath58 . for our purposes",
    "it is useful to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , in a more economical way , as @xmath59 where @xmath60^{-1 } \\,\\,\\ , . \\label{meff}\\ ] ] at this stage some important remarks are in order .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ added ] ) and ( [ meff ] ) we see that the latter depends on the intensity of applied force given by the dimensionless parameter @xmath56 so that , unlike @xmath23 , @xmath61 is not a universal quantity ( see figure [ fig3 ] )    and can not be treated as a true effective mass .",
    "nevertheless , due to its mathematical form , this quantity will be useful to illustrate some issues related to perturbation theory since one can perform an expansion in powers of the  coupling \" parameter @xmath54 upon which an eventual temperature dependence may be imposed .",
    "then , a first glance at other aspects of modern theories such as the importance of non perturbative methods and the renormalization group equations becomes possible , as we shall see in the next two sections . in particular , by exploiting the effects of temperature on the scale dependent equation ( [ meff ] ) one is able to present a simple illustration regarding the use of perturbative / non perturbative techniques in modern theories . with this aim",
    "let us recall that in most classical mechanics courses @xmath54 is usually treated as a constant @xcite . however , in practice , this quantity can change under the influence of other parameters such as the temperature . for example , a skier transfers energy to the snow underneath the skis , thereby melting the snow and creating a thin film of liquid that reduces friction @xcite .    in other physical systems",
    "@xcite , heat - activated plastic deformations and other thermal effects can also induce a temperature dependence on @xmath54 .",
    "in this section , we will suppose that our @xmath54 also changes with the temperature .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the thermometer of some device which generates these thermally induced changes ( the exact manner in which this happens does not concern us here ) .",
    "let us just suppose that the experiments show a decrease of @xmath54 , with increasing temperatures , which can be mathematically described by @xmath62 \\,\\,\\",
    ", , \\label { mut}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 so that @xmath64 ( one could also have multiplied eq .",
    "( [ mut ] ) by the step function , @xmath65 ) .",
    "now , plugging this equation into eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) one can see how the effective mass  runs \" with the temperature . setting @xmath66 one obtains figure [ fig5 ] , which displays @xmath67 , signaling that @xmath68 .    to conclude this section",
    "let us remark that in both situations discussed above the numerical values of the parameters @xmath4 ( subsection ii.a ) and @xmath54 ( this subsection ) give the intensity of the relevant interactions .",
    "to reinforce , once again , further analogies between the classical and modern descriptions of the effective mass note that within the latter such quantities are called the coupling constants . as discussed in the next section , the one which is relevant for qcd ( @xmath69 ) decreases with increasing temperatures ( asymptotic freedom ) somewhat like our @xmath70 , and @xmath71 inducing the effective quark mass to approach its bare value .",
    "the concepts of bare and effective mass are widely employed in modern quantum field theories ( qft ) . within these theories",
    "one usually starts from a lagrangian density written in terms of the bare masses and interactions whose intensity is given by coupling parameters , @xmath72 .",
    "as in the classical case the interactions induce a change @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 stands for quantum ) in the value of the observed ( effective ) mass , @xmath75 . in principle , one must evaluate the quantity @xmath73 , which is called the self energy .",
    "in classical physics the self energy of a system is the contribution to its energy resulting from the interaction between different parts of the system . in the many body problem in quantum mechanics",
    "the self energy is the difference between the energy of the quasi particle associated with the particle and the energy of the bare particle .",
    "the particle interacts with its surrounding medium , which in turn acts back on the original particle . in",
    "qft the self energy of a particle is the contribution to the energy ( mass ) of the particle due to the virtual emission and absorption of particles .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath73 , within qft , is far from being a trivial matter .",
    "one reason for this is due to the fact that apart from the obvious @xmath72 dependence the self energy often depends on the particle energy - momentum , @xmath76 , which has to be integrated over . at the same time , if the particle is in contact with a thermal bath and/or in a dense medium the self energy will also depend on the temperature ( @xmath33 ) and/or on the density ( @xmath4 ) . in a typical qft computation of the self energy",
    "one considers equations like @xmath77 + ...",
    "+ \\alpha^n [ l_1^n(p)+ l_1^{n-1 } l_2(p)+ ... + l_n ( p)]+ ... \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 represents integrals over @xmath76 .",
    "most of the time , the exact evaluation of @xmath73 is not possible and one must employ some approximation technique .",
    "for example , if @xmath79 one can use perturbation theory by evaluating just the first few terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) . however , if @xmath80 non perturbative techniques must be employed . in this type of approximation one",
    "re - sums an infinite subset of contributions .",
    "for example , if for some physical reason the integrals @xmath81 appear to be more important than the others it becomes possible to write @xmath73 as the series @xmath82 } \\ , , \\label{hartree}\\ ] ] which is non perturbative in the coupling @xmath72 .",
    "however , in many cases a major problem arises when the integrals over @xmath76 produce divergences since the measurable @xmath83 is finite .",
    "let us illustrate the above discussion with a few examples .",
    "a nice illustration is provided by the neutron effective mass at high densities which is relevant for studies concerned with neutron stars @xcite . at zero density",
    "the neutron has a ( bare ) mass @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the speed of light .",
    "however , within the confines of a neutron star this quantity changes drastically as a result of interactions which , as discussed , are taken into account by the self energy . in this evaluation",
    "one is not concerned by the temperature since this quantity is approximately zero in a neutron star .",
    "typically , the models employed in this computation consider @xmath86 and a resummation technique like eq .",
    "( [ hartree ] ) must be employed .",
    "finally , when one is only interested in density effects the integrals are carried up to a finite ( fermi ) momentum value without producing any divergence .",
    "the result of this evaluation shows that the effective neutron mass @xmath87 decreases with density @xcite .      in order to discuss the renormalization problem",
    "let us now consider quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) at zero temperature and density .",
    "for this theory , @xmath88 and perturbation theory works as confirmed by many successful predictions . in the introduction",
    "it was mentioned how the values which represent the electron mass inside ( @xmath89 ) and outside ( @xmath90 ) a solid are different .",
    "the theoretical solid state physicist may predict both values by evaluating the ( always finite ) self energies whereas his / her experimentalist colleague is able to measure both quantities .",
    "the theoretical situation is rather different at the fundamental ( qed ) level since @xmath13 diverges because the integrals @xmath78 are evaluated over all possible ( even infinite ) momentum values which concern the virtual particles . as with the immersed body , the electron inside a solid , or the neutron in a dense medium , the interactions change the mass value but this time to an unacceptable infinite value .",
    "however , one should note a major difference concerning these four cases .",
    "namely , in the first three situations one can always know , experimentally , the bare mass values by turning off the interactions . note carefully that what the solid state physicist calls the electron s bare mass is what the high energy physicist calls the effective mass .",
    "this is because both physicists are interested in different energy scales and the most relevant interactions for the first are the ones between the electron and the lattice . in principle",
    ", the solid state physicist can measure how an electron inside the solid responds to an externally applied force . at the same time , she / he can measure how an identical electron outside the solid responds to an applied force thereby determining what he / she calls the bare mass . the last procedure would correspond to  turning the interaction off \" . however , in a fundamental field theory like qed this is not possible because the interactions are inherent so that for the high energy physicist who is concerned with the interactions between the electrons and virtual photons the interaction is always  on \" . in other words ,",
    "the electron mass is always dressed up by the interaction with virtual particles and it can , eventually , be further dressed up by other type of interactions like the one due to the presence of a lattice .",
    "therefore , at the most fundamental level , the real bare mass of free electrons can never be measured . within the renormalization programme",
    "one uses this fact to redefine the bare mass so that it exactly cancels the divergence produced by the self energy producing a finite value for the observable @xmath83 .",
    "this procedure brings in some arbitrariness @xcite which will be briefly addressed in the last section .",
    "in the next two sections we will discuss some analogies between our classical systems and the fundamental theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . to make this discussion more profitable let us review some relevant qcd issues .",
    "the fundamental particles involved in this theory are six different types of quarks whose respective masses appear with two different values in some particle data tables @xcite .",
    "one value refers to the current mass ( @xmath91 ) and the other to the constituent ( or effective ) mass value , @xmath83 .",
    "for example , the up quark ( @xmath0 ) , which is the lightest , has a current mass close to @xmath92 while its constituent mass is about @xmath93 in hadrons and @xmath94 in mesons .",
    "quarks , which are fermions , interact among themselves by the exchange of spin-1 bosons called gluons .",
    "contrary to photons , gluons interact with each other producing an effect known as asymptotic freedom which basically means that the qcd coupling ( @xmath69 ) decreases with high energies ( temperatures ) or small distances .",
    "asymptotic freedom implies that there should be a qualitative change in the properties of hadronic matter as the temperature and/or the density is increased .",
    "a cold and dilute system could be described in terms of pions , nucleons and other hadrons . however , in a very hot and/or dense system quarks and gluons would be free to roam in what is called a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "one can envisage that a phase transition from hadron matter to quark - gluon plasma could have occurred in the early universe .",
    "as far as the actual computations are concerned asymptotic freedom means that one must revert to non perturbative techniques when considering low temperatures since @xmath69 is large in those regimes . on the other hand one",
    "can , at least in principle , use perturbation theory when performing high temperature evaluations . for our purposes",
    "it is useful to consider the evaluation of the quark thermal effective mass , @xmath95 $ ] . as within qed",
    "the integrals usually produce a divergent ( @xmath96 ) plus a finite piece ( @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 .",
    "one possibility , to obtain renormalized results , is to define the bare mass as @xmath99 where @xmath91 represents the finite current mass .",
    "one then obtains the finite constituent thermal mass , @xmath100 .",
    "the decreasing of @xmath101 with increasing temperatures shows that @xmath102 at temperatures close to @xmath103 .",
    "since a quantitative discussion of these issues within qcd is too difficult to be carried out here one should refer to the classical examples , previously discussed , in order to get some mathematical insight .",
    "a few remarks are now in order .",
    "first , note that the numerical values of the quark masses found in the literature depend on the way they are defined ( model dependent ) . also , since individual quarks",
    "can not be observed their masses are not directly observable .",
    "finally , note that many times in the literature the terms current mass and bare mass are taken to represent the same quantity .",
    "this language problem arises because there are different ways of implementing the renormalization programme @xcite ( e.g. , counterterms or multiplicative renormalization constants ) . to avoid confusion and to pursue our analogies we shall use , in the next section , the term bare mass as representing the current mass since renormalization issues will not appear",
    "using eq . ( [ meff ] ) one can also give a flavor of feynman s diagrammatic way of doing physics . to use a notation similar to the one employed in qft",
    "let us define the quantity @xmath104 with units of @xmath105 . then , eq .",

    "\\label{self}\\ ] ] one can represent both eqs .",
    "( [ serie ] ) and ( [ self ] ) in a diagrammatic way by attributing some rules to each of the quantities , @xmath61 , @xmath46,@xmath54 and @xmath13 .",
    "let us represent the first by a thick line , the second by a thin line , the third by a small black dot and @xmath13 by a bubble to get figure [ fig6 ] .    in modern physics , such as qft , it is often impossible to know the whole series representing a physical quantity such as eq .",
    "( [ whole ] ) .",
    "instead one knows , for each theory , a set of ( feynman ) mathematical rules to compute the graphs shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "however , the bubbles can also have an inner structure which can be very complicated .",
    "in fact , in qft the bubbles are the diagrammatical representation of the integrals @xmath78 displayed in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) . as already emphasized ,",
    "this calls for approximations in the computation of quantities like the effective mass .",
    "let us use our results for the sliding block supposing that @xmath108 and @xmath109 . then , eq .",
    "( [ serie ] ) can be written as @xmath110 making a good prediction of the actual @xmath111 numerical value . however , as @xmath54 increases more terms are needed if one wants more precision .",
    "for example , setting @xmath112 , the exact result for @xmath113 is @xmath114 while our perturbative first order prediction is @xmath115 .",
    "but if @xmath116 the exact result is @xmath117 while the first order perturbative result performs rather poorly , predicting @xmath118 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the failure or success of the lowest orders perturbative predictions depend on the actual value of the parameter @xmath54 unless @xmath119 .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the value of @xmath54 can change with the temperature ( see eq .",
    "( [ mut ] ) ) .",
    "then , by replacing @xmath120 in eq .",
    "( [ first ] ) while remaining within the limit @xmath109 one sees that , like in qcd , lowest order approximations will perform better at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures .",
    "finally , it is worth remarking that the development of reliable non perturbative techniques to tackle qcd is a very important domain of modern research .",
    "the reader interested in a formal discussion of perturbation theory via feynman diagrams in classical mechanics is refered to a recent work by penco and mauro @xcite .",
    "as we have emphasized there is a major difference between our two classical quantities @xmath23 and @xmath61 given by eqs .",
    "( [ added ] ) and ( [ meff ] ) respectively .",
    "namely , the first is a true effective mass being independent of the intensity of applied force ( @xmath56 ) ultimately used to measure it .",
    "our @xmath61 on the other hand clearly displays the fact that eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) was obtained by some redefinition of the terms entering newton s second law for the sliding block .",
    "although this equation has no advantages concerning practical applications of newton s second law one can again profit from its form to illustrate qft related issues . first , note that the quantity @xmath61 would be @xmath56 independent only if @xmath54 itself had a compensating @xmath56 ( or @xmath11 ) dependence , that is if @xmath121 .",
    "however , this scenario can not be considered simply because experimental observation rules it out . on the other hand , in qft calculations",
    "one often ends up with quantities which depend upon some arbitrary energy scale , @xmath122 , which is introduced during the formal mathematical manipulation of the integrals , @xmath78 , in a procedure known as regularization @xcite . as we have mentioned in section",
    "iii.b many of these integrals diverge in the limit @xmath123 ( ultra violet divergence ) and one way of regularizing the theory requires the introduction of scale parameters ( @xmath122 ) which , _ contrary _ to ( @xmath56 ) , do not belong to the original theory .",
    "so , in qft one has @xmath124 but needs to further require that the predicted ( and measured ) value for this quantity be @xmath122 independent .",
    "mathematically , this requirement translates into @xmath125 which is a renormalization group type of equation @xcite .",
    "we see that the coupling constant @xmath72 is allowed to run with @xmath122 , that is @xmath126 in a way dictated by the term @xmath127 which is called the @xmath128-function . for qcd",
    "the @xmath128-function is such that the coupling constant decreases with increasing energies ( or temperatures ) leading to asymptotic freedom , a fact confirmed by experiments .",
