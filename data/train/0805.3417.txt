    "since @xcite , and followed by others ( @xcite ) , ripples and dunes observed on the bed of sandy rivers have been interpreted as the two most unstable modes of the same linear instability .",
    "although the classification of river bedform types is a difficult task ( @xcite ) , subaqueous ripples and dunes are standardly defined by their typical size : ripples are the small scale bedforms whose wavelength @xmath0 scales on the grain size and dunes are those whose wavelength is comparable to or larger than the flow depth @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a variant of this definition was used by @xcite : dunes are the bed features larger than ripples that distort significantly the free surface and are out of phase with the standing waves they generate ; ripples are the triangular shaped bed - forms that have `` lengths of less than about 2 feet and heights of less than about 0.2 foot '' . in some other articles ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the classification of bedforms is rather based on the ratio of the grain diameter @xmath2 to the viscous sub - layer depth , i.e. on the particle reynolds number @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the shear velocity and @xmath5 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ) .",
    "these criterions are questionable , especially when there is no clear separation of length - scale between the spacing of ripple crests and the flow depth , and also in the case of bedforms superimposed on larger structures ( @xcite ) . in this paper , willing to refer to the dynamical mechanisms involved in the formation of these bedforms , we shall call ripples those whose characteristics are independent of the flow depth ; in contrast , dunes are directly related to the presence of a free surface .",
    "in particular , we shall not use the terms ` sand wavelets ' , as suggested by coleman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to designate the initial stage of ripples when they emerge from a flat sand bed .",
    "experimental measurements on subaqueous ripples are numerous and exhibit large data dispersion .",
    "one of the reasons for such a dispersion is that ripples exhibit pattern coarsening , i.e. present a progressive increase of their typical length - scale as time goes by ( @xcite ) .",
    "many authors have only measured fully - developed wavelengths , whose relation with the initial wavelength @xmath0 is still an open issue that will be discussed here .",
    "a reference data base of final wavelengths in inclined flumes has been completed by @xcite . although not directly comparable to the predictions of a linear stability analysis , these data show distinct scaling laws for hydraulically smooth and rough granular beds . for a particle",
    "reynolds number @xmath3 smaller than few unities , the viscous sub - layer is larger than the grain size @xmath2 and the fully - developed ripple wavelength turns out to scale on @xmath6 , with a large   yet unexplained   prefactor ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "on the other hand , when the grain diameter @xmath2 is larger than the viscous sub - layer , the wavelength was found to slowly increase with @xmath4 . here",
    "we will focus on this hydraulically rough regime , in which the flow is turbulent at all scales down to the grain size .",
    "this corresponds to the domain of validity of the calculations performed in part i. in several experimental articles ( @xcite ) , the initial wavelength @xmath0 has been carefully determined , showing scaling laws independent of the flow depth @xmath1 . at large particle reynolds number , @xmath0 is found to be almost independent of the shear velocity @xmath4 and to increase with the grain diameter @xmath2 ( for instance @xcite propose @xmath8 ) .",
    "these measurements will serve as a benchmark for the theory developed in the present paper .    concerning dunes ,",
    "most of the measurements have been performed in natural rivers , for which the froude number @xmath9 is low ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in the mississipi river ( @xcite ) , in the missouri river ( @xcite ) , in the rhine ( @xcite ) and in the rio paran ( @xcite ) , the observed wavelengths range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 for froude numbers around @xmath12 .",
    "the suggestion by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite that mature dunes should present a well selected wavelength scaling on @xmath13 is thus far from reflecting the natural dispersion of field data .",
    "flume experiments ( see @xcite , @xcite and the data collected by @xcite ) have been performed in a much larger range of froude numbers ( from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ) and also show well - developped bedform wavelengths between @xmath1 and @xmath16 .",
    "the extensive data published by @xcite are particularly impressive , and the interested reader should refer to the original article rather to the truncated data - set plotted by @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these data in detail in the last section of the present article .    .",
    "[ schematic ] ]    it is widely accepted that ripples result from a linear instability , whose key mechanism is the phase difference between sediment transport and bed topography ( @xcite ) .",
    "this spatial shift can be conceptually splitted into two contributions . as seen in part 1",
    ", there is a lag between the bed elevation profile and the basal shear stress , encoded in the ratio @xmath17 , which results from the simultaneous effects of inertia and dissipation i.e. from hydrodynamics only ( fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) .",
    "in addition , sediment transport needs some time / length to adapt to some imposed shearing . @xcite and",
    "his followers ( @xcite ) have introduced a phenomenological spatial lag @xmath18 ( this lag is called @xmath19 in these papers ) in a phase shift equation : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the saturated ( or equilibrium ) flux , which is a function of the basal shear stress . with such relation between @xmath22 and @xmath21 , the phase shift between the sediment flux and",
    "the shear stress over a relief of wavelength @xmath0 is then simply @xmath23 , which corresponds to a phase delay for @xmath24 , but to a phase advance for @xmath25 . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "such a constant phase lag is not physically founded and should be replaced by a first order relaxation equation of the form @xmath26 this linear equation reflects the fact that the sand flux reaches its saturated value over a characteric length @xmath18 ( @xcite ) . as for any other first order system , the phase delay between the flux and the shear stress increases here from @xmath27 for large wavelengths to @xmath28 for wavelengths much smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "when the sum of the phase lags coming from hydrodynamics and transport results into a maximum flux upstream the bed crest , sediment deposition occurs on the bump , leading to an unstable situation , i.e. to the amplification of the bedform ( fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) .",
    "conversely , when the maximum flux is located downstream the crest , the bump is eroded and the disturbance decay . with the flux equation ( [ shiftedflux ] ) , even a potential description of the flow ( @xcite ) for which the basal shear stress is in phase with the topography ( see part 1 ) , can then find an unstable  but unphysical  region .",
    "however , sediment transport has a definite stabilising role , and the destabilising mechanism must result from hydrodynamics .",
    "the description of a turbulent flow over a sinusoidal bottom has been , in this context , progressively improved by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "none of these articles take into account a saturation length .",
    "as discussed in part  1 , the basal shear stress is generically found to be in phase advance with respect to the bottom profile .",
    "this means that , without any stabilising mechanism , all wavelengths are found unstable .",
    "a key mechanism introduced by @xcite and kept in the following models is the stabilisation of short wavelengths by slope effects . in these models ,",
    "the prefered wavelength results from hydrodynamics and is proportional to the hydrodynamical roughness @xmath29 ( or to @xmath6 in the case of a viscous surface layer treated by @xcite ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the predicted wavelengths are smaller than all experimental findings by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the concept of flux saturation was correctly introduced in a linear stability analysis by @xcite , the flow being modelled by depth averaged equations standardly used in hydraulics .",
    "however , these equations can not describe the layered structure of the turbulent flow above bumps ( see @xcite and part 1 ) , and in particular the so - called inner layer which is responsible for the phase shift between shear and topography . as a consequence ,",
    "this author missed the explaination of the ripple instability .",
    "the idea that @xmath18 is the relevant lengthscale for the problem of dune formation was introduced in the aeolian context by @xcite .",
    "linear stability analyis developed in this context ( @xcite ) suggest that the initial wavelength actually scales on @xmath18 , and not on @xmath29 .",
    "this line of thinking has been applied since then to subaqueous ripples ( @xcite ) .",
    "although @xmath18 and @xmath29 are both ultimately related to the grain size @xmath2 , they correspond to very different mechanisms associated to sand transport and hydrodynamics respectively .",
    "although @xcite suggested that dunes could form by the same linear instability as ripples , no article has ever exhibited a proper and complete dispersion relation showing , in the same graph , the growth rate @xmath30 for a range of wave - numbers @xmath31 that includes both ripples and dunes . in the figures provided by @xcite",
    ", @xmath30 is rescaled by @xmath32 , which artificially enhances the small @xmath31 ( dunes ) region .",
    "more recently , colombini ( @xcite ) revisited this problem , introducing the thickness of the transport layer has a key parameter .",
    "this empirical refinement gives in practice an adjustable phase shift between relief and sand transport and allows to get a single well - defined peak in the dispersion relation , associated to dunes , at a wavelength on the order of the flow depth .",
    "however , this model does not predict the existence of a small - scale ( ripple ) instability anymore .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to discuss afresh this ripple and dune formation problem , and in particular to get such a complete relation dispersion , where the peak associated to ripples is present . to reach this goal",
    ", we must first discuss the sediment transport issue , before mixing it with the hydrodynamics presented in part  1 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , we eventually show that dunes can not form by a linear instability mechanism , and must rather result from the interaction and non - linear pattern coarsening of ripples , limited by the free surface , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in the next section devoted to the sediment transport issue",
    ", we show how to abstract the details of the transport mechanisms into a general framework for the description of the different modes of transport and thus valid in the subaqueous and aeolian cases . a quantitative model of the transport threshold that includes the slope effects",
    "is proposed .",
    "we then show that the sediment transport can be limited either by the erosion rate or by the momentum available in the flow . with these ingredients ,",
    "we propose a self - consistent model that unifies these two mechanisms and discuss the scaling law of the saturation length @xmath18 . in section  3 ,",
    "we revisit the formation of current ripples ( and aeolian dunes ) by linear instability , using the quantitative hydrodynamic calculation performed in part  1 .",
    "it confirms that the most unstable wavelength is determined by the saturation length , and not by the hydrodynamical roughness .",
    "inverting the problem , this allows to determine the saturation length from experimental measurements of the initial wavelength and to discuss its dependence on the grain size and the shear velocity . finally , using the systematic expansion of the flow field with respect to the corrugation amplitude performed in part  1 , we discuss the non - linear selection of ripple aspect ratio . in section  4",
    ", we investigate the effect of a free surface on the linear instability .",
    "we show that the excitation of standing waves at the surface has a stabilising effect , independently of the details of the flow and sediment transport models , which is by no means consistent with the formation of river dunes by a primary instability . in the last section , we present field experiments performed in the leyre river , in france , that directly evidence the formation of ripples by a linear instability and the formation of dunes by a non - linear pattern coarsening limited by the free surface .",
    "further observations suggest that mega - dunes form when the sand bed presents hetereogeneities such as a wide distribution of grain sizes . finally , we review and discuss the data available in the literature in the light of these theoretical and experimental results .",
    "we present here a general framework to describe , with only few key variables , the sediment transport properties .",
    "this framework can accomodate various situations associated to different modes of transport ( bed load , saltation , reptation , etc ) and different dynamical mechanisms controlling this transport ( hydrodynamical erosion of the bed , splash , mixing by turbulent fluctuations , etc ) .",
    "the reference situation is a uniform turbulent boundary layer of constant shear velocity @xmath4 over a flat sand bed characterised by a threshold shear velocity @xmath33 . in this situation",
    ", one observes a steady uniform transport characterised by a flux @xmath21 called the saturated flux , which corresponds to an equilibrium state between flow and transport .",
    "@xmath21 is a function of @xmath4 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is important to emphasise the precise meaning of @xmath4 in this context . on the one hand ,",
    "@xmath4 is defined from the reynolds shear stress , i.e. from the averaged correlation of velocity fluctuations @xmath34 . on the other hand ,",
    "the transport is mostly determined by the velocity field inside the transport layer of thickness @xmath35 ( few grain diameters in the case of bed - load and typically @xmath15  cm in the aeolian case ) .",
    "if the latter is embedded in the inner layer , then the average velocity is locally logarithmic and can be related to the basal shear stress .",
    "@xmath4 should thus be determined from velocity measurements performed inside this inner layer ",
    "i.e. typically at a distance of @xmath36 from the bed , see part 1 .",
    "the time - scale over which the momentum is exchanged increases linearly with the distance @xmath37 from the surface ( it scales as @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , the velocity fluctuations at time - scales smaller than @xmath38 should be associated to the turbulent shear stress and those slower than @xmath38 , to variations of @xmath39 . the shear velocity @xmath39 relevant for sediment transport should thus be averaged over the time - scale @xmath40 .    considering an inhomogeneous situation",
    "  for instance a spatial variation of the shear stress  ",
    "the sand flux is not instantaneously in equilibrium with the local shear stress . in most of the situations ,",
    "the transient toward equilibrium can be described by a first order relaxation law , with a single time and length scales : @xmath41 where the flow goes in the increasing @xmath42-direction . in a situation homogeneous in space ,",
    "@xmath43 is the time needed for the flux to reach again the saturation if the flow speed suddenly changes .",
    "conversely , in a steady situation where there is no sediment flux at the entrance of a volume of control , @xmath18 is the length needed for the flux to reach @xmath21 .",
    "as the relaxation time is usually much smaller than the time - scale of evolution of the bedform , we are left with a description of the transport by three variables : the saturated flux @xmath21 , the threshold shear velocity @xmath33 and the saturation length @xmath18 .",
    "note in particular that gravity effects are included into the transport threshold .",
    "this multi - scale approach allows to separate clearly the dynamical mechanisms that govern the emergence of bedforms from those governing sediment transport . in other words , subaqueous ripples and aeolian dunes",
    "are of the very same nature : a primary instability that is not sensitive at all to the mode of transport ( e.g. bed - load _ vs _ saltation , see @xcite ) .",
    "this framework lies on two important assumptions .",
    "first , the depth of the inner layer in which the shear stress is vertically homogeneous should always remain larger than the depth of the transport layer   see part 1 .",
    "second , there is in general more than one relaxation mode and consequently a whole spectrum of relaxation times and lengths .",
    "the description by a first order relaxation implies that one of these modes is significantly slower than ( and thus dominant in front of ) the others .",
    "otherwise , two or more saturation lengths have to be taken into account in a higher order relaxation equation .",
    "an important such case is the suspended load , which must be described by a field ( the sediment concentration ) and not by a scalar ( the integrated flux ) .",
    "of course , a saturated flux @xmath21 exists in that case ( the only particularity is the explicit dependence of @xmath21 on the flow depth ) but , there is an infinite number of modes describing the behavior around saturation .",
    "we will thus restrict the discussion to the case of grains sufficiently heavy to prevent suspension .",
    "this is realized in practice for ripples and dunes in rivers , at moderate froude numbers .",
    "it has been observed by @xcite that antidunes , which form in above @xmath44 , produce so much turbulent kinetic energy that suspended load could be dominant .",
    "this situation , probably highly non - linear , and which requires a specific treatment ( see @xcite ) ) , is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "we aim here to discuss the origin of the existence of a transport saturated state and to propose a self - consistent model , predicting the main characteristics of transport : the static threshold , the saturation length and the saturated flux .",
    "the bed load threshold is directly related to the fact that the grains are trapped in the potential wells created between neighbouring grains at the sand bed surface . to obtain the scaling law of the threshold shear stress ,",
    "the simplest geometry to consider is a single spherical grain jammed between the two fixed grains below it ( see figure  [ trajectory ] in the appendix  [ staticthreshold ] ) .",
    "we consider the situation in which the cohesive forces between the grains are negligible and the friction at the contacts is sufficient to prevent sliding .",
    "the loss of equilibrium occurs for a value of the driving force @xmath45 proportional to the submerged weight of the grain : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mass density of the sand grain , and @xmath48 is that of the fluid . as @xmath45 is proportional to the shear force @xmath49 exerted by the fluid , the non - dimensional parameter controlling the onset of motion is the shields number @xmath50 , which characterises the ratio of the driving shear stress to the normal stress : @xmath51 the threshold value can be estimated from a force balance . in the viscous regime ,",
    "the grain drag coefficient @xmath52 is inversely proportional to the grain reynolds number @xmath53 : @xmath54 ; it is constant ( @xmath55 ) in the turbulent regime .",
    "note that the turbulent drag is not only due to the fluctuations induced by the grain itself , as in the case of a grain falling in a fluid at rest , but also to those present in the turbulent flow .",
    "this situation has never been studied properly so far .",
    "note also that the drag force is _ a priori _ different in the vicinity of the ground and that the lift force could be non - negligible when the grain is trapped at the surface of the sand bed . in order to avoid introducing two many parameters",
    ", we will not consider these effects here .",
    "typical values found in sedimentation experiments performed with natural sand grains are @xmath56 and @xmath57 . the generic situation is a uniform shear stress @xmath58 , for which the velocity profile is linear in the viscous regime : @xmath59 and logarithmic in the turbulent regime : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the von krmn constant and @xmath62 the ratio of the aero or hydrodynamic roughness to the grain diameter .",
    "the threshold shields number is constant ( see appendix [ staticthreshold ] ) , both in the viscous @xmath63 and in the turbulent regimes : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the avalanche slope . the laminar - turbulent transition , indicated by the grey zone in figure  [ threshold]c ,",
    "is determined by the reynolds number and thus depends on the grain diameter @xmath2 . in most of the situations relevant in geophysics",
    ", @xmath2 lies in the cross - over between these two regimes .",
    "figure  [ threshold ] shows the comparison between experimental data for natural sand grains and the full model , whose derivation is provided in appendix  [ staticthreshold ] .",
    "there is no adjustable parameter in the model as one can independently measure the avalanche slope @xmath66 , the drag coefficients and the sand bed roughness @xmath67 .     as a function of the grain size @xmath2 , for natural sand grains in water .",
    "symbols : measurement by @xcite ( @xmath68 ) and by @xcite ( @xmath69 ) .",

    "dashed line : asymptotic behaviour in the viscous regime .",
    "grey zone : zone in which the viscous sub - layer is larger than the bed roughness : for grains smaller than @xmath73 m , the bed is hydraulically smooth for any shear stress @xmath4 above the threshold @xmath33 .",
    "[ threshold ] ]    it is worth noting that continuum mechanics can not predict correctly this threshold .",
    "assuming that the granular presssure @xmath74 and the shear stress @xmath75 are continuous at the fluid / grain interface , the standard coulomb criterion @xmath76 leads to a null threshold shear stress .",
    "part of the problem comes from the fact that the pressure @xmath74 felt by the first layer of grains is due to its own weight : @xmath77 .",
    "introducing such a pressure discontinuity , one finds a threshold shields number @xmath78 , which is independent of the flow regime and much too large , compared to measurements .",
    "this means that there is no continuity between the fluid and the granular shear stresses , making continuum descriptions of sediment transport inherently problematic .",
    "due to gravity , it is much easier to transport sediments along the lee side of a sand bump than on the stoss slope .",
    "this effect is directly encoded into the dependence of the saturated flux on the transport threshold , which depends on the slope .",
    "let us note @xmath71 the bed angle at the scale of the saturation length .",
    "the force balance now reads : @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the fluid velocity around the grain at the threshold ( see appendix  [ staticthreshold ] ) .",
    "we keep the notations @xmath33 and @xmath81 for the threshold shear stress and the threshold shields number for an horizontal bed ( @xmath82 ) and denote by @xmath83 and @xmath70 the thresholds in the case of an inclined bed .    the dependence of the threshold on the slope has been measured experimentally by @xcite for sand grains , in the turbulent regime .",
    "the model matches quantitatively the results , without any adjustable parameter ( solid line on figure  [ threshold]b ) .",
    "neglecting the fact that @xmath52 is a function of the grain reynolds number , the threshold shear stress can be written as : @xmath84 . inserting this expression into the saturated flux formula",
    ", one can see that gravity leads to a down - slope component of the flux , i.e. to a diffusion mechanism .",
    "this approximation still gives a reasonable fit of the data ( dotted line in figure  [ threshold]b ) .",
    "the slope dependence of the threshold shear stress has also been measured in the case of aeolian transport , for rough sand grains ( @xcite ) and is again perfectly fitted by the model .",
    "however , there exists an unexplained discrepancy in the case of spherical glass beads in a viscous liquid ( fig .",
    "[ threshold]b ) , as one would need a very low effective friction @xmath85 much lower than the avalanche slope ( @xmath86 ) to fit the data ( @xcite ) .",
    "with such a value , the gravity effect becomes completely negligible .",
    "importantly , the whole gravity effect on sand transport can be encoded into the threshold slope dependence , at the linear order in @xmath71 .",
    "this was directly proved experimentally by @xcite in the sub - aqueous case and by @xcite in the aeolian case . in different articles",
    "( @xcite and followers ) , @xmath65 was considered as a parameter that can be adjusted to fit the initial ripple wavelength . as they were missing the correct stabilising mechanism , aberrantly low values of the repose angle were found . in section  [ wavelengthselection ] ( see also fig .  [ lambdamax ] ) , where the wavelength selection issue is discussed , we shall keep for @xmath65 the avalanche slope determined experimentally .",
    "when a sand bed is submitted to a flow , only a small fraction of the grains at the surface are entrained and this erosion process takes some time to occur .",
    "we first model the erosion rate , and in particular the role played by the disorder of the surface .",
    "we define @xmath87 the fraction of grains at the surface susceptible to be entrained at a shields number @xmath50 . in the absence of flow , for @xmath88",
    ", @xmath89 is null .",
    "it increases very quickly around the mean threshold shields number @xmath81 and reaches @xmath15 for large velocities .",
    "@xmath87 reflects and encodes the distribution of potential wells at the sand bed surface .",
    "whatever the functional form chosen for this quantity , there are two important parameters : the shields number around which @xmath89 switches from @xmath27 to @xmath15 , which reflects the overall transport threshold , and the typical slope @xmath90 in the same zone .",
    "a simple choice is : @xmath91 for the sake of simplicity , we consider that one grain at the surface occupies an area @xmath92 .",
    "we start from a very simple assumption : when one grain is entrained , we hypothesise that there can be no further erosion in the surrounding area until the grain has moved by a distance comparable to its own diameter @xmath2 .",
    "the description of the elementary jump by one grain diameter is derived in appendix [ grainmotion ] .",
    "the erosion time @xmath93 is the time needed to move over a distance @xmath2 .",
    "it behaves as : @xmath94\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_f d}{(\\rho_s-\\rho_f ) g } } \\label{approxtturb}\\ ] ] in the turbulent regime and @xmath95\\ , \\left(\\frac{d_\\nu } { d}\\right)^{3/2 }   \\,\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_f d}{(\\rho_s-\\rho_f ) g } } \\label{approxtvisc}\\ ] ] in the viscous regime .",
    "this means that the mean velocity goes to @xmath27 at the threshold like @xmath96 $ ] , which corresponds to a bifurcation much sharper than the standard saddle node bifurcation in @xmath97 . the experimental observation ( @xcite ) that the grain velocity ",
    "i.e. the mean velocity conditioned by the fact that the grain moves significantly at the time resolution of the instrument   is non zero just above the threshold is thus fully consistent with this expression .",
    "far from threshold , the grain velocity is just proportional to the flow velocity ( @xcite ) .    the erosion flux @xmath98 is the volume of grains eroded per unit time and unit surface .",
    "it can be expressed as an integral over all possible local configurations : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the bed volume fraction . a good approximation of this integral is given by : @xmath101 } \\,\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\rho_s}{\\rho_f}-1\\right ) g d}\\quad { \\rm for } \\quad \\theta_m<\\theta<\\theta_m,\\ ] ] where @xmath102 in the turbulent regime and @xmath103 in the viscous regime . in particular",
    "one can recover from this expression the expected asymptotic behaviours .",
    "close to the threshold , there is a regime in which the density of mobile grains is not sufficient to induce a significant reduction of the flow strength in the transport layer , and the grains can be considered as isolated , which corresponds to a dilute transport layer .",
    "the saturation of the flux is then controlled by the erosion rate and the disorder of the sand bed .",
    "this idea is due to @xcite , who proposed a semi - phenomenological model that uses extensively experimental results . in the present model ,",
    "the length of a trajectory is independent of the trap in which the grain was initially at rest and fluctuates around a well defined average value @xmath104 .",
    "the mean area explored by the grain is @xmath105 and contains , by definition of @xmath104 , a mean number of potential wells sufficiently deep to trap the grain equal to @xmath15 .",
    "we then obtain the expression : @xmath106 at small @xmath50 , @xmath104 is simply one grain diameter @xmath2 ; at large @xmath50 , @xmath89 tends to @xmath15 so that @xmath104 diverges .",
    "this divergence has been directly evidenced experimentally in the viscous case , by @xcite . in that case , the measured value of @xmath107 is around @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath104 is the length needed for the transport to adapt to a change of shear stress .",
    "it thus gives the saturation length @xmath18 .",
    "this behaviour constrains the domain of validity of this regime : the shear velocity should be around the threshold , the transport should be intermittent and diluted and the distribution of potential wells should be very large . as suggested by the experiments of @xcite ,",
    "a granular bed prepared by sedimentation is initially very disordered and consequently presents a wide range of potential wells .",
    "it then takes a very long time for the surface to re - arrange , leading to a drift of the distribution @xmath89 toward larger and larger threshold shear stresses .",
    "this long transient is probably not relevant to geophysical situations in which the time and length scales of the systems are always sufficiently large to ensure that an equilibrium state for the geometrical arrangement of surface grains has been reached .",
    "the saturated flux is simply the erosion rate times the hop length @xmath104 : @xmath109 } \\,\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\rho_s}{\\rho_f}-1\\right ) g d^3}\\quad { \\rm for } \\quad \\theta_m<\\theta<\\theta_m .",

    "one expects this roughness to be larger than in the transport - free case as a consequence of the increase of the dissipation rate  the fact that the particles are moving does not lead to a drag reduction .",

    "the sand flux is the product of the grain velocity by the density of mobilised grains .",
    "two important mechanisms can thus control the saturation length : the length needed by the grain to reach its asymptotic velocity   the so - called drag length   and the length needed for erosion to take place i.e. the trajectory length @xmath104 .",

    "the erosion length gently increases with the shear velocity while the drag length is independent of it ; the drag length increases with the density ratio @xmath140 but , experimentally , this parameter can not be easily varied by a large factor .",

    "therefore , in contrast to what is suggested by @xcite , the normal velocity of the grain - fluid interface does significantly change the flow in this problem .",

    "at the resonance , the free surface is in quadrature with the bottom , which tends to move downstream the point of maximum shear stress i.e. to stabilise the bedform .",
    "of course , as the influence of the free surface on the flow is localised over a typical distance @xmath0 , its effect is more important as @xmath264 becomes smaller . in summary",
    ", there are two conditions under which the free surface can overcome the inertial destabilising effect : ( i ) around the resonance , since the standing wave amplitude is very large and ( ii ) in the limit of small wavenumbers , as @xmath1 becomes much smaller than wavelength @xmath0 .",
    "this is precisely what can be observed in figure  [ frkh ] , the sharp stable zone surrounding the resonant curve . for obvious reasons ,",
    "this new minimum of the growth rate associated to the surface wave resonance comes with a local maximum of @xmath30 ( thin dotted line along the restabilised zone ) . in the work of @xcite",
    ", the latter has been associated to the formation of dunes by a linear instability . in many other linear analysis ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the prediction of ripples is missed for the reasons detailed above ( the sediment transport relaxation is not correctly taken into account ) , i.e. the corresponding maximum in the dispersion relation is absent . as a consequence ,",
    "they are left with a unique peak in the region of @xmath264 around unity , which is found here to be a secondary maximum .",
    "as explained below , we fundamentally disagree with the conclusion reached in all these papers that subaqueous dunes result from the linear instability of a flat bed .",
    "let us briefly recall the basic reasons for which one usually associates the appearance of a pattern to a maximum of the growth rate .",
    "one considers that the initial condition @xmath278 is essentially flat , with some wide - band noise .",
    "its fourier transform @xmath279 then contains some energy in a wide range of wavenumbers @xmath31 . in the linear regime , the surface profile reads : @xmath280 if the distribution of initial amplitude is initially sufficiently flat and if the growth rate @xmath263 presents a sharp _ absolute _ maximum in @xmath168 , then a pattern dominated by the corresponding wavelength @xmath181 emerges , as this mode grows the fastest . in the present case , the amplitude of this secondary maximum close to the resonance is almost the same as the value of @xmath30 at the same wavenumber in the unbounded case .",
    "moreover , most of the modes between the resonance and the ripple peak are in fact much more unstable : if a linear instability could be invoked , the amplitude of all these intermediate modes would eventually be larger than that of this local maximum .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the primary and the secondary maxima of the growth rate is on the order of @xmath281 which is a large number : it is typically on the order of @xmath282 for flume or small river experiments ( @xmath283 m and @xmath284  cm ) and @xmath285 for a large river ( @xmath283 m and @xmath286  m ) . for example , taking half a minute for the characteristic ripple apparition time ( see fig .  [ amplitudetime]a ) , it would give @xmath287 days for the dune linear growth time - scale , i.e. much too large in comparaison to observations ( see fig .",
    "[ wavelengthtime ] ) . for these reasons , this secondary peak in the dispersion relation can not be associated to dunes .",
    "let us contrast this subaqueous situation to that of aeolian ripples superimposed on aeolian dunes .",
    "as already mentioned , the instability mechanism of these dunes is of the same hydrodynamics nature as that of subaqueous ripples , i.e. comes from the upwind shift of the basal shear stress with respect to relief .",
    "aeolian ripples , however , are generated by a screening instability : the upwind face of ripples receives more impacts of saltating grains than the downwind face ( @xcite ) .",
    "rapidely , non - linearities makes the ripple pattern saturate to a wavelength much smaller than that at which dunes emerge , and this saturation is faster than the dune time formation .",
    "one can then consider that dunes results from the linear instability of a flat bed which presents saturated aeolian ripples .",
    "moreover , the growth rate at the wavelength of ripples in the dune instability is negative , because ripples are smaller than the aeolian saturation length .",
    "conversely , the growth rate at the wavelength of dunes in the ripple instability is much smaller than the growth rate at the same wavelength in the dune instability . in conclusion",
    ", aeolian ripples and aeolian dunes can truly be associated to two different linear instabilities . in the case of subaqueous ripples and dunes ,",
    "none of these criterions ( different destabilizing mechanisms , saturation of ripples wavelength , separation of the modes by several decades of almost non - growing wavelengths ) is full - filled .",
    "in this last section , we present direct experimental evidences that river dunes do not form by a linear instability .",
    "we will discuss our field measurements in the light of the model proposed here and show reciprocally that all existing observations are consistent with this model .",
    "we will finally propose a new definition of the different subaqueous bedforms , based on the physical mechanisms which control their formation .",
    "we have studied the formation of ripples , dunes and mega - dunes in the leyre river .",

    "a pattern coarsening toward dunes is observed which saturates at @xmath304  cm and @xmath305  mm after typically one hour : tracking the pattern during further @xmath306  hours , we did not observe any significant change of these characteristics . ]",
    "the experiments were conducted as follows .",
    "using long parallel metallic bars , the surface of the sand bed was carefully leveled at time @xmath307 , and the formation of bedforms was directly observed . in order to measure the emergence of ripples , we used a ( water proof ) laser sheet inclined at a low angle to the horizontal .",

    "[ wavelengthtime]a ) .",
    "a statistically stationary state is eventually reached , which corresponds to what was observed in the natural conditions , i.e. before the experiment ( fig .  [ wavelengthtime]c ) .",
    "as in flume experiments ( @xcite ) , we have observed a coarsening of the ripple pattern , i.e. a progressive growth of the wavelength by merging of bedforms ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ amplitudetime]a shows that this growth is linear in time and stops when the wavelength @xmath0 becomes on the order of the flow depth @xmath1 .",
    "both these processes and the time - scales over which they take place are consistent with the observations of @xcite for flume experiments at larger froude numbers . again , with a bed motion at the scale of hours , the approximation of a flow over a steady relief is almost perfect .",
    "consistently with the theory , we did not observe the emergence of wavelengths directly at the scale of the flow depth  mm ) and the moderate water depth ( @xmath336  m ) are such that the typical size of the first emerging bedforms ( few decimeters ) are comparable . ] .",
    "we thus reach the conclusion that the formation of dunes should not be associated to a linear instability but to a non - linear pattern evolution . in the unbounded case ( an infinite flow depth ) , it is probable that this pattern coarsening would have no limit as it is driven by hydrodynamics , which is mostly self - similar . the observation that this coarsening stops at some final wavelength",
    "should therefore be associated to a stabilising mechanism , namely the presence of the free surface .",
    "the places selected for the experiments were of particular interest as different final wavelengths were observed across the river ( fig .",
    "[ wavelengthtime]c - e ) .",
    "the experiments just described above have been performed in of the side of the river ( say , at a distance less than the third of the river width from the bank ) . in this ` external ' region , the sand is well sorted and the dune wavelength is observed to saturate for a rescaled wave - number @xmath264 just below the resonant conditions ( fig .",
    "[ ridedune]a ) .",
    "by contrast , in the central part of the river , much larger bedforms are present ( fig .",
    "[ wavelengthtime]d - e ) .",
    "they display superimposed dunes on their stoss side , and we call mega - dunes here - after",
    ". the river slope and the flow velocity were not significantly different in the dune and mega - dune regions .",
    "the major difference was the presence of coarse grains causing bed armouring in the central part of the river .",
    "as shown in figure  [ wavelengthtime]e , the transition between the two regions is rather sharp .",
    "we have flattened the bed over a zone of @xmath337  m in length and @xmath338  m in width to observe the formation of mega - dunes .",
    "the initial stage is the formation of ripples composed of small sand grains that merge , leading to the same dunes as described on the side of the river .",
    "however , in the course of this pattern coarsening , the inter - dune zone becomes richer in coarse grains so that the dunes eventually propagate on a bed which is more difficult to erode .",
    "they progressively amalgamate into mega - dunes of wavelength ten times larger than the dunes , covered with superimposed ripples and dunes . even in the asymptotic state ,",
    "superimposed bedforms are continuously generated . as they propagate faster than the mega - dune , they accumulate at its crest . during the transient of formation of mega - dunes ( typically @xmath243  hours in our experiments ) ,",
    "the pattern is disordered and is not composed by a unique fourier mode .",
    "as far as one can say without having explicitly performed a multi - scale analysis of the topography , structures of growing size were progressively formed , which become ordered as they reach the final mega - dune wavelength ( between @xmath339 and @xmath11 ) .    in summary , a small difference in the experimental conditions ( here , most probably , the presence of coarse grains or not ) can significantly affect the pattern coarsening dynamics .",
    "the wavelength of mega - dunes can be larger than those of dunes by one to two orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ ridedune]a ) . with this observation ,",
    "the question is not anymore to find a new destabilising mechanism to explain the dune formation .",
    "rather , as larger and larger bedforms are produced by non - linear processes , one needs to identify a stabilising mechanism limiting this coarsening . as evidenced here , this is exactly the role played by the free surface .",
    "figure  [ ridedune ] presents several series of measurements of the final bedform wavelength collected in the literature for flume experiments ( panel b ) and natural rivers ( panel c ) .",
    "the most impressive data - set is certainly that reported by  @xcite .",
    "as these authors separated their data into ripples and dunes on the basis of a definition that we do not agree with ( see introduction ) , we have ignored here their annotations .",
    "importantly , @xcite have not looked at the transient of formation of bedforms but have focused on the long time regime .",
    "for example , they have often started a new experiment with a bed in the state reached at the end of the previous run . moreover , the control parameters ( slope and flow rate ) were varied in the course of the experiment to maintain constant secondary quantities such as the flow depth or the froude number .",
    "this methodology is probably responsible for the lack of reproducibility and the huge dispersion of data ( one decade horizontally ) on can see in figure  [ ridedune]b .",
    "by contrast , the series of experiments performed by @xcite are much more controlled and reproducible .",
    "in particular , the wavelength is measured as a function of time starting from a flat sand bed and fitted to obtain its asymptotic value .",
    "these flume experiments clearly evidence the difference between the initial wavelength at which ripples form , their evolution by pattern coarsening to form dunes and the non - linear selection of the final wavelength due to the free surface .",
    "note that we have not taken into account the correction of raw measurements performed by @xcite to take into account the temperature dependence of the viscosity , as it is a non - sense in the hydraulically rough regime .",
    "the last points in figure  [ ridedune]b have been obtained by @xcite .",
    "as for @xcite , we have not taken into account the denomination of the bedforms ( ripple or dunes ) used in this article .",
    "the points obtained by @xcite and @xcite are very close to the resonant conditions ; the whole data set of @xcite is clearly in the subcritical regime   at low @xmath9 and/or low wavenumber @xmath264   and globally follows the resonance curve . we have gathered in figure  [ ridedune]c the points measured in the leyre river , in the grdyd tidal chanel ( @xcite ) , in the mississipi river ( @xcite ) , in the missouri river ( @xcite ) , in the rhine ( @xcite ) and in the rio paran ( @xcite ) .",
    "one can observe that the dunes propagating on the stoss slope of mega - dunes lie in the same region of the diagram as the simple dunes ",
    "roughly between @xmath340 and @xmath341 . the mega - dunes lie between @xmath342 and @xmath340 .",
    "it should be emphasised that the different points in this graph correspond to very different flow depth @xmath1 ( compare e.g. the megadunes in the leyre river shown in figure  [ amplitudetime]d and those in the rio paran shown in figure  [ ridedune]d ) .",
    "it means that the saturation length , which determines the wavelength at which ripples form , is not a relevant length for the formation of dunes and mega - dunes .",
    "we then see why a distinction between ripples and dunes based on some absolute dimension considerations are misleading from the physical point of view : depending on the value of the water depth , bedforms ` of less than about @xmath244 feet ' ( @xcite ) , or ` less than @xmath343  m ' ( @xcite ) , can feel or not the free surface . nor a criterion based on the amplitude @xmath344 of distortion of the free surface can be satisfying to define dunes .",
    "figure  [ resonancefrkh ] shows the value of @xmath345 in the parameter space ( @xmath9,@xmath264 ) , computed using the hydrodynamical model detailed in part 1 .",
    "one observes that the free surface is distorted by less than @xmath346 of the bedform amplitude for @xmath347 or for @xmath348 . with a definition based on the amplitude of distortion of the free surface such as that proposed by @xcite",
    ", there would be no dune at all in natural rivers ! at low froude numbers ,",
    "dunes do not distort significantly the free surface .",
    "approaching @xmath44 from below , the distortion of the free surface , in antiphase with the topography , becomes more and more pronounced ( fig .",
    "[ resonancefrkh]b ) . above @xmath349 ,",
    "this effect becomes sufficient to create a zone of stable wavelengths around the resonance ( fig .",
    "[ frkh ] ) and thus a gap to cross during the pattern coarsening .",
    "these results then suggest a new classification of river bedforms based on the dynamical mechanisms responsible for their formation .",
    "the most obvious criterion is the sensitivity to the presence of the free surface .",
    "we thus define ripples as the bedforms whose wavelength @xmath0 is sufficiently small compared to the flow depth @xmath1 not to feel the finiteness of the flow depth . in the diagram @xmath9 vs @xmath264",
    ", they are located in the supercritical region , i.e. their wavenumber is larger than the resonant value .",
    "when the scale separation between the flow depth and the saturation length is sufficient , the structures that form by linear instability of a flat sand bed are ripples . beyond the linear regime the pattern coarsening leads to growing wavelengths that reach the resonance curve . once in the subcritical region on the left of this curve ( see fig .",
    "[ ridedune ] ) hydrodynamics becomes affected and in some case dominated by the presence of the free surface and the bedforms can be called dunes . as evidenced by our field experiments , the pattern coarsening can end with very different bedforms depending on the conditions ( e.g. the grain size distribution ) .",
    "the associated non - linear selection of pattern wavelength is an open problem ( see @xcite ) that will require specific investigations .",
    "our observations suggest to define mega - dunes as bedforms sufficiently large to present superimposed dunes . with this definition , what is usually called ` river bars ' in the literature falls into our category of mega - dunes .",
    "similarly , the term ` sand - wavelet ' introduced by coleman ( see e.g. @xcite ) are ripples in their initial stage .",
    "it is furthermore worth noting that dunes can present superimposed ripples when the scale separation between the flow depth @xmath1 and the saturation length @xmath18 is sufficient .",
    "the criterion to separate dunes from mega - dunes is then based on the location of the superimposed bedforms with respect to the resonance curve in the plane @xmath9 vs @xmath264 .",
    "this distinction is important as in very deep water , the pattern coarsening would lead to ripples large enough to accommodate superimposed ripples on their stoss side . in this case , one should talk about mega - ripples . in summary , the appellation of given subaqueous bedforms should be chosen in function of their location in the diagram @xmath9 vs @xmath264 , with a suffix mega- to point out the presence or not of superimposed structures .",
    "as the present paper aims both to present novel results and to discuss the state of the art of the physics of ripples and dunes , we wish to sum up in this section , in a qualitative manner , our methodology and key results .",
    "we have shown that the linear instability of a flat sand bed can be abstracted in terms of four well - defined quantities :    * the component of the basal shear stress in phase and in quadrature with the bottom ( the parameters @xmath150 and @xmath151 , see part 1 ) , * the relation between the sediment flux , the shear stress and its threshold value , which determines the time - scale of the instability but does not influence the initial wavelength , * the saturation length , i.e. the relaxation length between the sediment flux and the shear stress , which essentially determines the length - scale of the instability , * the relation between the threshold shear stress and the slope , which encodes the stabilising effect of gravity .",
    "the framework resulting from these ingredients is very general and can encompass a wide spectrum of specific models without any profound difference of nature .",
    "as discussed in the first part of these twin papers , the details of the hydrodynamical description can affect @xmath150 and @xmath151 to various degrees , depending for instance on the physics at work in the surface layer or on the way the different length - scales of the problem intermix with each other  see the summary section of part  1 . from the choice of a particular transport model",
    ", one can compute the steady ( or saturated ) value of the sediment flux , as well as the characteristic length over which the actual flux relaxes to equilibrium .",
    "finally , the expression of the threshold shear stress as a function of the grain size , the bed slope and other possible parameters ( e.g. the cohesion between the grains ) comes from a separate mechanical model .",
    "doing so , one can then independently investigate the effect of each dynamical mechanism on the formation of ripples and dunes .",
    "we have devoted a large fraction of this part  2 to the study of two sediment transport regimes .",
    "they differ by the nature of the mechanisms that make the flux saturate :    * an erosion limited regime , in which the negative feedback of the particle transport on the flow is negligible .",
    "the saturation of the flux is limited by the time needed to entrain one grain at the surface of the sand bed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the associated saturation length is determined by the distribution of the traps at the surface of the bed .",
    "it is proportional to the grain size and it should diverge when the shear velocity reaches the value for which the flow is sufficient to entrain all the grains at the surface . * a momentum limited regime , in which the flux saturates due to the extra - shear stress exerted by the moving grains on the fluid ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the shear velocity is not too large so that bed load is the dominant mode of transport , the saturation length is dominated by the grain inertia thus proportional to the density ratio between the grain and the fluid times the grain size .    we have derived a detailed model of bed load describing both the erosion limited and the momentum limited regimes that is able to fit the data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have also derived a quantitative model for the threshold shields number , which takes into account the bed slope effect and is able to reproduce the observed decrease at the transition between the viscous and the turbulent regimes .",
    "sheet flows , in which the grains flow over a significant number of grain diameters , and suspended load are outside the validity of the model because they require a different hydrodynamical treatement where the flow inside the transport layer must be modelled .    these different ingredients at hand ,",
    "we have performed the linear stability analysis of a flat sand bed .",
    "the destabilising mechanism is of hydrodynamical nature and is related to the phase advance of the basal shear stress with respect to the topography .",
    "two stabilising mechanisms are identified : the sediment transport saturation length @xmath18 and the slope effect , which depends on the ratio @xmath196 .",
    "as @xmath18 is generically larger than @xmath29 , it dominates and essentially determines the scaling law followed by the most growing wavelength @xmath181 .",
    "this most unstable mode is associated to ripples , which thus form by a linear instability . in the case of a smooth bottom ,",
    "the roughness seen from the inner layer is governed by the viscous length @xmath6 , which may dominate the scaling of @xmath181 if @xmath6 is larger than @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .    due to the slope effect , the ratio @xmath186 is a decreasing function of @xmath196 .",
    "we have analysed different sets of measurements of initial ripple wavelengths @xmath181 available in the literature and deduced the corresponding saturation length , assuming that the hydrodynamical model is correct .",
    "@xmath18 is found roughly independent of @xmath4 and between @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",
    "these values are consistent with a saturation length limited by the grain inertia ( @xmath352 ) as previously stated by the authors ( @xcite ) .",
    "this prediction is especially good for large grains ( @xmath353 mm ) , for which viscous effects are completely negligible .",
    "however , the data show systematic dependencies that are not captured by the present model : the wavelength at which ripples form is systematically larger for smaller or rougher grains .",
    "we have performed field experiments in the leyre river , whose results show that the evolution of the ripple wavelength @xmath0 and amplitude @xmath216 at short time are consistent with a linear instability . we also observed that these ripples present a pattern coarsening : their wavelength grows and saturate just after crossing the resonance condition of surface waves .",
    "in the course of this pattern coarsening , the bedforms are in quasi - equilibrium between erosion and deposition , a situation for which we have shown that the aspect ratio of ripples can be predicted quantitatively using the weakly non - linear description of hydrodynamics derived in part  1 .",
    "the influence of the river free surface on the bed is stabilising .",
    "as shown in part  1 and in agreement with standard hydraulics , the gravity waves excited at the free surface by the bedforms are in phase at small @xmath354 ( supercritical regime ) and in antiphase at large @xmath354 ( subcritical regime ) . in between",
    ", the free surface is phase - advanced with respect to the bottom , so that it tends to induce a phase - delay of the shear stress on the ground .",
    "bedforms of wavelength around the resonance conditions are thus stabilised .",
    "moreover , at very large @xmath354 , the inner layer invades the whole flow and the free surface again has a strong stabilising effect . as no destabilising mechanism",
    "is associated to the presence of the free surface , dunes do not form by a linear instability .",
    "this result is directly confirmed by our field experiments showing that they form by non - linear pattern coarsening , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , our experiments show that the non - linear selection of the final wavelength is very sensitive to small changes in the experimental conditions , and in particular to the presence of coarse grains .",
    "finally , our results suggest to classify subaqueous bedforms according to the dynamical mechanisms that control their formation .",
    "we thus propose the following bedform definitions and characteristics :    * ripples are bedforms whose wavelength @xmath0 is sufficiently small compared to the flow depth @xmath1 not to feel the presence of the free surface . in the diagram @xmath9 vs @xmath264 , they are located on the right of the resonance curve ( supercritical regime ) .",
    "they form by linear instability and their initial wavelength essentially scales on the saturation length @xmath18 .",
    "they exhibit pattern coarsening and remain ripples until they cross the condition of resonance of the surface waves . * dunes are bedforms whose wavelength @xmath0 is sufficiently large compared to the flow depth @xmath1 to be stabilised by the presence of the free surface . the ripple pattern coarsening generically leads to the formation of dunes . in the diagram @xmath9 vs @xmath264 , they are located along the resonance curve on the subcritical side .",
    "if the flow depth @xmath1 is much larger than the wavelength at which ripples form , dunes may present superimposed ripples . * like dunes , mega - dunes are under the influence of the free surface and on the left side of the resonance curve but they present superimposed dunes .",
    "they typically result from the coarsening of a dune pattern pushed to very large wavelength by heterogeneities ( in particular a polydispersed sediment ) .",
    "further studies are needed to investigate this non - linear wavelength selection in details . in the purpose of describing the interactions between bedforms",
    ", future models will have to incorporate hydrodynamical non - linearities and in particular flow separation , for which the systematic expansion with respect to the amplitude performed in part  1 may serve as a well - controlled starting point .    ' '' ''    the field work has been carried out in agreement with the parc naturel rgional des landes de gascogne .",
    "this work has benefited from the financial support of the french minister of research .",
    "in this appendix , we derive an explicit expression of the transport threshold , valid both in the viscous and turbulent regimes . we introduce the effective velocity @xmath355 of the flow around the sand grains and define for convenience its normalised counterpart : @xmath356 for the sake of simplicity , we will take for @xmath355 the fluid velocity at the altitude @xmath357 . a good approximation of the relation between the shear velocity @xmath4 and the typical velocity around the grain @xmath355 is given by @xmath358 where @xmath5 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath61 the von krmn constant and @xmath62 the aerodynamic roughness rescaled by the grain diameter @xmath2 .",
    "the rescaled bed roughness @xmath62 is on the order of @xmath359 .    at the threshold ,",

    "@xmath52 is the drag coefficient , which is a function of the grain reynolds number @xmath362 . with a good accuracy",
    ", the drag law for natural grains can be put under the form : @xmath363 at this stage , we introduce the viscous size @xmath364 , defined as the diameter of grains whose free fall reynolds number @xmath365 is unity : @xmath366 it corresponds to a grain size at which viscous and gravity effects are of the same order of magnitude . from the three previous relations , we get the equation for @xmath367 : @xmath368 which solves into @xmath369 ^ 2 . \\label{uth1}\\ ] ] the corresponding expression of the static threshold shields number is finally : @xmath370 in the viscous regime , the above relations simplify into : @xmath371 in the turbulent regime , we get : @xmath372 as can be seen in figure  [ threshold ] , the most interesting range of grain diameters , between @xmath248 m and @xmath373 mm , is precisely the zone of transition between the two regimes .",
    "the crossover grain diameter @xmath374 scales as : @xmath375 which is around @xmath236 m .",
    "to describe the elementary jump by one grain diameter , we write the equation of motion of one grain dragged by a flow of effective velocity @xmath355 and submitted to gravity .",
    "we assume that it looses completely its energy during collisions , due to the thin layer of fluid between the grains .",
    "contrarily to @xcite and @xcite , we do not introduce any ` effective friction ' : instead , we take into account the geometry of the trapping grains ( fig .  [ trajectory ] ) , which is the physical effect responsible for this friction , as for the transport threshold .        starting from the position of the grain @xmath376 , we get its velocity @xmath377 and its tangential acceleration @xmath378 .",

    "none of these behaviors is correct , whatever the shape of the bed load equation @xmath408   einstein - brown , bagnold or those derived in the text .",
    "there are two simple reasons for this failure .",
    "first , the continuum approach ignores the process by which the momentum is transferred from the fluid to the grains ( namely the drag of the grains ) .",
    "second , the flux @xmath22 evolves both because the number of moving particles evolves and because their velocity changes .",
