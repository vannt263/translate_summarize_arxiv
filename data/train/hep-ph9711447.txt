    "for some years , polarized compton scattering , the scattering of circularly - polarized photons by spin - polarized electrons , has been used to measure the degree of polarization of one particle or the other .",
    "circularly - polarized gamma - ray photons from nuclear decays have been polarization - analyzed by measuring the asymmetry in the rates of backscattering from magnetized iron foils ( as the foil magnetization is reversed ) .",
    "similarly , the polarization of electrons in high - energy storage rings and accelerators has been determined from scattering asymmetries of the accelerated beam with beams of optical laser photons . until quite recently , all such measurements have made use of tree - level ( order-@xmath3 ) expressions for the polarized compton scattering cross section .",
    "part of the reason for this has been the unavailability of a next - to - leading - order calculation that is packaged in an easily usable form .",
    "the first calculation of the order-@xmath1 virtual and real - soft - photon corrections to unpolarized compton scattering was published by brown and feynman in 1952 @xcite .",
    "this calculation was not confirmed until 1972 when tsai , deraad , and milton ( tdm ) published the same corrections for the polarized case @xcite .",
    "the tdm calculation , by itself , is sufficient to interpret the results of measurements involving longitudinally polarized electrons for which the presence of additional energetic photons in the final state can be excluded .",
    "this is often the case for measurements of gamma - rays that have been scattered from magnetized iron targets .",
    "however , accelerator - based polarimeters are often designed to measure transverse electron polarization and generally can not distinguish between single - photon and multiple - photon final states .",
    "these shortcomings were addressed in 1987 by gngora and stuart ( gs ) who published the matrix elements for the hard - photon corrections in a spinor - product form that is suitable for numerical evaluation @xcite .",
    "their publication also includes spinor - product expressions for the matrix elements of six gauge - invariant tensors used by tdm to calculate their result .",
    "these expressions permit the application of the tdm virtual corrections to the case of general initial- and final - state electron spin directions .",
    "finally , in 1989 , the complete set of virtual , soft - photon , and hard - photon radiative corrections to polarized compton scattering was calculated independently by veltman @xcite .",
    "paper describes her calculation qualitatively and presents a result in numerical form for two specific cases of an accelerator - based longitudinal polarimeter .",
    "unfortunately , it does not include detailed expressions for the final result nor is the result checked against the tdm or gs calculations .",
    "one of the specific cases discussed by veltman , the case of a 50  gev longitudinally - polarized electron colliding with a 2.34  ev photon , is quite close to that of the sld compton polarimeter ( a 45.65  gev longitudinally - polarized electron colliding with a 2.33  ev photon ) .",
    "this polarimeter is a key component in the measurement of the left - right @xmath4-boson production asymmetry @xmath5 which has been performed over several years by the sld collaboration @xcite . at the current time , the measured value of @xmath5 is approximately 8% larger than the value of the comparable quantity extracted from measurements of six different @xmath4-pole asymmetries by the four lep collaborations @xcite . since the sld and lep measurements differ by approximately three standard deviations , the discrepancy is more likely to be due to systematic effects than to statistical fluctuations .",
    "one possible systematic effect is the absence of radiative corrections from the interpretation of the sld polarimeter data .",
    "veltman s calculation implies that radiative corrections would shift the sld polarization measurements by @xmath20.1% of themselves which is far too small and of the wrong sign to account for the 8% discrepancy .",
    "this paper describes a complete order-@xmath1 calculation of polarized compton scattering .",
    "it was undertaken primarily to check the calculation of veltman and to determine if radiative corrections to compton scattering could be responsible for discrepancy between the lep and sld measurements of @xmath4-pole asymmetries .",
    "a second goal was to develop a computer code which could applied to a variety of present and future experimental situations .",
    "the main ingredients of this code , the tdm and gs calculations , are sufficient for all present day experimental situations .",
    "however , it is likely that a very high energy linear electron - positron collider will be constructed somewhere in the world in the coming decade .",
    "polarized beams are planned for all of the designs now under discussion .",
    "all of these projects incorporate compton scattering polarimeters into the optical designs of their final focusing systems .",
    "if these polarimeters use optical lasers , the @xmath6 center - of - mass energies will be above threshold for the production of final state @xmath7 pairs .",
    "since the process @xmath8 occurs at order-@xmath1 , it must also be included in the computer code .",
    "a calculation of the matrix element for this process , based upon the techniques of ref .",

    "their calculation is the first application of numerical spinor product techniques @xcite to a case involving massive spinors .",

    "gngora and stuart point out that one can substantially simplify some of the expressions by a judicious choice of these auxiliary momenta .",
    "they present results for two equivalently - simple sets of momenta .",
    "this approach provides an important cross check ( one must find identical results for both sets of auxiliary momenta ) and greatly facilitated the debugging of the gs manuscript and the computer code .",
    "a number of typographical errors were discovered in ref .",

    "one should note that the first set of auxiliary momenta ( used to calculate gs eqs .",
