    "@xmath2 is the number of electrons and @xmath3 is the landau level degeneracy with @xmath4 the 2deg area and @xmath5 the magnetic length . besides the well known ( uniform ) laughlin states responsible for the fractional and integer quantum hall effects@xcite , many nonuniform phases are also possible .",
    "these states have spatial modulations of the electronic and/or spin densities .",
    "they have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental work using a variety of techniques over the past 35 years .",
    "famous examples are the wigner crystal,@xcite the bubble crystals , the quantum hall stripe staterevuebulles , microwave , yoshioka , goerbig , cotebubble , cotestripes and the skyrme crystal.@xcite    experimental evidence for the crystal phases can be obtained from microwave absorption experiments@xcite which detect the gapped phonon mode of the crystal pinned by disorder . in the case of the skyrme crystal which has an exotic spin texture ,",
    "optically pumped nuclear magnetic resonance ( op - nmr)@xcite has been particularly useful in measuring the magnetization of the crystal as a function of the filling factor and zeeman coupling as well as its low - lying collective excitations which involve two gapless ( goldstone ) modes.@xcite in op - nmr , the magnetization is obtained by measuring the knight shift ( @xmath6 ) of the @xmath7ga nuclei around @xmath8 in gaas / algaas multiple quantum wells .",
    "this technique exploits the fermi contact hyperfine interaction that exists between the magnetic moment of the @xmath7ga nuclei in the gaas quantum wells and the spin of the electrons in the confined 2deg .",
    "a nonzero local spin polarization of the electrons modifies the local magnetic field seen by the nuclei and shift their resonance frequency by an amount @xmath9 which is proportional to the electronic spin polarization .    in a related technique : resistively detected nuclear magnetic resonancedesrat ( rd - nmr ) , the knight shift of the @xmath10as nuclei in the quantum well is obtained from the change in the longitudinal resistance @xmath11 of the 2deg .",
    "this change , @xmath12 is related to the change in the electronic zeeman energy which is caused by the coupling via the hyperfine interaction of the average nuclear magnetic moment @xmath13 and the electron zeeman energy @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the external magnetic field and @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "this technique has been used to study the liquid - solid phase transition of the 2deg at small filling factor in landau levels @xmath17 and @xmath18@xcite it has also been applied to the skyrme crystal ( or skyrmion liquid ) near @xmath8 where an anomalous spectral line shape is detected.desrat,gervais,gervais2,tracy,barrett    the rd - nmr technique has been used recently@xcite to study the spatial modulations of the electronic density ( or , more precisely , of the spin density ) i.e. the topography of the electron solids in the integer and quantum hall regimes .",
    "it is well known ( see for example ref . ) that the density pattern of a wigner crystal changes with the landau level index @xmath19 because the wave function of an electron in a magnetic field depends on @xmath19 .",
    "this change in topography is reflected to some degree in the nmr spectral line shape .",
    "indeed , in experiments , the wigner crystals detected at small filling factors in landau levels @xmath17 and @xmath20 show very different rd - nmr spectra.@xcite in the present work , we want to find out how different the spectral line shape of other crystal states ( bubble , stripe , and skyrme crystals ) are from one another and how well the rd - nmr  technique can discriminate between them .",

    "the nuclei in the quantum well see an effective magnetic field that depends on their location and so their knight shift varies spatially .",

    "the spectra of the phases bc2 , sc2 are shown in fig .",
    "the density @xmath61 being bigger in the hole phases than in the electron phases , the knight shift is larger in the former than in the latter .    as @xmath71 increases , the radius of the ring in the @xmath132 bubble crystal increases .",

    "the @xmath223 bubble crystal has two rings and one central maximum on each site . from fig .",
    "5 , as @xmath71 increases , the average value of the magnetization increases and there are more oscillations in @xmath148 and consequently more structure in @xmath239 in each case , there is one oscillation with a large value of @xmath240 and other smaller ones . in the stripe phase , the oscillations are much less pronounced than in the crystal phases . as regards its nmr spectrum , this phase is close to that of the uniform phase .    in fig . 5 , the numbers above the lines for @xmath241 and @xmath242 identify the regions in @xmath148 that are responsible for a peak in the corresponding plot of @xmath77 shown in fig . 6(a ) .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "5(b ) that , in comparison with @xmath206 the @xmath213 bubble crystal has one extra ring which adds the extra peaks numbered @xmath243 and @xmath244 in fig .",
    "6(a ) for @xmath245    the spectral line shape of the bc1 , sc1 crystals changes with increasing @xmath71 and is different from that of the uniform phase .",
    "the signal from the @xmath213 crystal at @xmath242 looks different from that of the @xmath132 crystal at @xmath208 but is not very different from the @xmath132 crystal at @xmath246 even though the functions @xmath77 shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) are quite different , many of the peaks in @xmath77 are too close in @xmath61 to be resolved in the spectra .",
    "for example , the peaks numbered @xmath22 and @xmath244 in fig .",
    "6(a ) ( for @xmath247 ) are spaced by @xmath248 this leads to peaks separated by @xmath249 khz in the line shape .",
    "this separation is smaller than the linewidth @xmath153 khz considered in our calculation .",
    "it follows that most of the interesting features in @xmath77 are lost in the integrated signal @xmath235 ( not considering the extra complication due to confining wave function ) .",
    "the signal from the @xmath223 bc1 crystal , however , is different from that of the @xmath250 crystal and the stripe phase .",
    "it has a characteristic long low frequency tail ( not visible in fig .",
    "6(a ) but it is finite up to @xmath166 and in fig .",
    "6(b ) it extends to @xmath251 khz ) . as we mentioned above",
    ", this phase may not be present in the ground state according to dmrg calculations .",
    "we expect the same conclusions to hold for landau levels @xmath252 since there are more oscillations in bubbles with higher values of @xmath128 and these oscillations are smaller in amplitude [ see the traces for @xmath253 and @xmath254 in fig .",
    "5(b ) ] . except in some range of @xmath71 ( fort @xmath255 for example )",
    "most spectra are sufficiently different from that of the corresponding uniform state to allow a discrimination between the uniform and crystal states .",
    "unfortunately , it does not seem possible to infer the number of electrons in each bubble crystal from its spectrum alone when @xmath256 ( with the exception of @xmath207 ) since the distinguishing features in the density are lost in the integrated signal",
    ". it may also be difficult to differentiate between the @xmath257 crystal and the stripe phase as their spectra are not dramatically different .",
    "moreover , the oscillations are small in the stripe phase and the corresponding nmr spectrum is close to that of the uniform state . one marked difference between the @xmath213 and @xmath132 spectra , however , is that the maximal knight shift ( in absolute value ) is larger in the former than in the latter . indeed , as fig .",
    "6(a ) shows , the maximum value of @xmath148 increases discontinuously with @xmath258     rd - nmr spectra ( full curves ) for the @xmath132 and @xmath213 bubble crystals at @xmath259 and @xmath158 and for the stripe phase at @xmath260 calculated with a linewidth @xmath261 khz .",
    "the dashed curves are the spectra of the corresponding uniform phases . ]    at some filling factors in @xmath222 , the difference between the crystal and liquid spectra is small and may be washed out by fluctuations .",
    "we give some examples of that in fig .",
    "6(b ) where the dashed - dotted curve represent the crystal phases calculated with a gaussian blurring factor @xmath262 which is the value necessary in @xmath17 to make the calculated spectrum agrees with the experimental result according to ref . .",
    "we see that , with the exception of @xmath263 the spectra for @xmath242 and @xmath264 are almost identical with those of the corresponding uniform states .",
    "we checked that the value of @xmath116 that brings the crystal spectrum identical with that of the uniform state for the wigner crystal at @xmath208 in @xmath265 are @xmath266 respectively .",
    "the crystal state is thus more fragile in higher landau levels .",
    "we have presented in this paper a study of the rd - nmr  spectra of various crystal phases that can theoretically exist as ground states of the 2deg in the quantum hall regime . in landau levels @xmath267 , wigner crystal , bubble crystal , stripe phase and skyrme crystal ( when present ) produce distinct rd - nmr line shapes that should allow their unambiguous experimental identification . in higher landau levels , the rd - nmr spectra are not so distinct with the exception of the @xmath207 bubble crystal . in these levels , crystal and uniform states can be distinguished but it would be difficult to differentiate between the wigner , bubble ( with @xmath268 and @xmath269 ) and stripe phases .",
    "our calculation assumed the ideal case of a frozen solid at zero temperature .",
    "as shown before@xcite , thermal fluctuations will render the crystal spectra closer to that of the uniform state .",
    "this will not help the differentiation of the different phases in @xmath256 since the small difference in the spectra will probably be washed out unless the temperature is very small",
    ".    the nmr  spectra would be more discriminating with a stronger hyperfine coupling between the electron gas and the nuclei or with a reduced linewidth @xmath46 but these parameters are fixed by the quantum well .",
    "we have used the value @xmath153 khz in all our calculations@xcite but , as a test , we show in fig .",
    "8 the spectra for the @xmath222 stripe phase at @xmath270 and the @xmath271 bubble crystals at @xmath241 and @xmath272 with a smaller linewidth @xmath273 khz .",
    "the distinction between the solid and uniform phases is much clearer [ compare with fig .",
    "6(b ) ] . apart from the important difference in the range of the knight shift for crystal with different values of @xmath128 , the spectra for the @xmath213 crystal and the stripe phase still have a similar shape .    in a real experimental situation ,",
    "the filling factor is tuned by changing the potential on a gate in the gaas / algaas quantum well .",
    "this modifies the shape of the confining wave function that enters the calculation of the nmrspectra .",
