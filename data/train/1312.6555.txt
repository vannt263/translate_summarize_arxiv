    "a breakthrough in our understanding of high - energy nuclear collisions is the recognition  @xcite that quantum fluctuations in the wavefunctions of projectile and target , followed by hydrodynamic expansion , result in unique long - range azimuthal correlations between outgoing particles .",
    "the importance of these fluctuations was pointed out in the context of detailed analyses of elliptic flow in nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "it was later realized that fluctuations produce triangular flow  @xcite , which has subsequently been measured in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite .",
    "recently , fluctuations were predicted to generate significant anisotropic flow in proton - nucleus collisions  @xcite , which quantitatively explains  @xcite the long - range correlations observed by lhc experiments  @xcite .",
    "recently , the atlas and cms experiments reported the observation of a nonzero 4-particle cumulant of azimuthal correlations , dubbed @xmath6 , in proton - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of a large @xmath6 in proton - nucleus collisions is not fully understood , even though it is borne out by hydrodynamic calculations with fluctuating initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "such higher - order cumulants were originally introduced  @xcite to measure elliptic flow in the reaction plane of non - central nucleus - nucleus collisions , and isolate it from other , `` nonflow '' correlations .",
    "it turns out that the simplest fluctuations one can think of , namely , gaussian fluctuations , do not contribute to @xmath6  @xcite . since flow in proton - nucleus collisions",
    "is thought to originate from fluctuations in the initial geometry , one naively expects @xmath7 , _ even if _ there is collective flow in the system .    in this paper , we argue that the values observed for @xmath6 in p - pb collisions are naturally explained by non - gaussian fluctuations , which are expected for small systems .",
    "our explanation differs from that recently put forward by bzdak et al .",
    "@xcite that it is due to symmetry breaking ( see eq .",
    "( [ bg ] ) and discussion below ) .",
    "as bzdak et al . , we assume that anisotropic flow @xmath8 scales like the corresponding initial - state anisotropy @xmath0 on an event - by - event basis .",
    "this is known to be a very good approximation in ideal  @xcite and viscous  @xcite hydrodynamics .",
    "thus flow fluctuations directly reflect @xmath0 fluctuations .",
    "now , @xmath0 is bounded by unity by definition . on the other hand ,",
    "gaussian fluctuations are not bounded , which is the reason why they fail to model small systems .",
    "we propose a simple alternative to the gaussian parameterization which naturally satisfies the constraint @xmath9 .",
    "we show that it provides an excellent fit to all monte - carlo calculations .",
    "in each event , the anisotropy in harmonic @xmath1 is defined ( for @xmath10 ) by  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the initial transverse density profile near midrapidity in a centered polar coordinate system .",

    "we use the phobos implementation  @xcite with a gaussian wounding profile  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the initial density @xmath12 is a sum of gaussians of width @xmath14  fm , centered around each participant nucleon with a normalization that fluctuates  @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations , which increase anisotropies  @xcite , are modeled as in ref .",
    "we have selected events with number of participants @xmath15 , corresponding to typical values in a central p - pb collision .",

    "the first is an isotropic two - dimensional gaussian ( we drop the subscript @xmath1 for simplicity ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and the distribution is normalized : @xmath18 .",
    "this form is motivated by the central limit theorem , assuming that the eccentricity solely originates from event - by - event fluctuations , and neglecting fluctuations in the denominator .",
    "note that this distribution does not strictly satisfy the constraint @xmath19 , which follows from the definition ( [ defepsilon ] ) . when fitting our monte - carlo results , we have therefore multiplied eq .",

    "we have proposed a new parameterization of the distribution of the initial anisotropy @xmath0 in proton - proton , proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions which , unlike previous parameterizations , takes into account the condition @xmath9 .",
    "this new parameterization is found in good agreement with results of monte - carlo simulations when @xmath0 is created by fluctuations of the initial geometry .",
    "our results explain the observation , in these monte - carlo models , that cumulants of the distribution of @xmath0 quickly converge as the order increases .",
    "this is because the fourier transform of the distribution of @xmath0 has a zero at a finite value of the conjugate variable @xmath94 .",
    "this , in turn , is a consequence of the fact that the probability distribution of @xmath0 has compact support ( that is , @xmath9 ) .",
    "the consequence of this universality is that while the rms @xmath0 is strongly model - dependent  @xcite , the probability distribution of @xmath0 is fully determined once the rms value is known  in particular , the magnitudes of higher - order cumulants such as @xmath95 . assuming that anisotropic flow @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath0 in every event , we have predicted the values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 in pb - pb collisions , and the values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 in p - pb collisions .",
    "if future experimental data confirm our prediction , these results will strongly support the picture that the long - range correlations observed in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions are due to anisotropic flow , which is itself proportional to the anisotropy in the initial state .",
    "this picture , furthermore , will be confirmed irrespective of the details of the initial - state model .",
