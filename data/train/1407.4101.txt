    "production of relativistic charged particle beams is an important area of research , due to its various applications in nuclear and particle physics , in plasma physics , and laboratory astrophysics . in recent years , with the rapid development of high - power laser technology , this field has been largely focused on laser - based techniques leading to the production and acceleration of particle beams .",
    "it has been demonstrated that laser - plasma accelerators can produce electron beams with energies around 1gev  @xcite .",
    "one should mention that laser - driven high - energy positron beams are much harder to generate .",
    "the first laser - driven positron beams have been achieved with energies less than 5mev  @xcite .",
    "the following experiments reached positron energies up to 20mev  @xcite .",
    "most recently , positron beams with energies up to 120mev have been produced in an all - optical setup experiment carried out at the hercules laser facility  @xcite .",
    "the experiment at hercules  @xcite has been based on a cascading mechanism initiated by the propagation of a laser - accelerated , relativistic electron beam through high - z solid targets .",
    "the positrons inside the solid were mainly generated via either a trident process , in which electron - positron pair production is mediated by a virtual photon in the electron field , or via a two - step process where the electron first emits a bremsstrahlung photon , which then produces an electron - positron pair via the bethe - heitler process .",
    "another possible scenario of producing electron - positron pairs is _ the nonlinear breit - wheeler process _ , which is the main topic of this paper . for recent reviews concerning electron - positron pair creation",
    ", we refer the reader to  @xcite .    in the original paper by breit and wheeler  @xcite , a collision of two photons which combined their energies to produce an electron - positron pair was considered .",
    "this idea was further generalized by replacing one of the photons by a strong laser field  @xcite . in these pioneering studies and in the following studies",
    "as well  @xcite , the laser field was treated as a monochromatic plane wave .",
    "the process in a weakly nonmonochromatic laser field was investigated by narozhny and fofanov in  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the laser - induced breit - wheeler process was successfully tested in a series of experiments carried out at slac  @xcite .",
    "the recent progress of ultra - intense lasers have stimulated even more advanced theoretical studies of the breit - wheeler process , which involve pulsed laser fields  @xcite .",
    "different aspects of the process have been studied in these papers , including the dependence of probability distributions of created pairs on intensity , shape , duration , and carrier - envelope phase of the driving pulse , as well as spin effects . here",
    ", we demonstrate for the first time how , by means of the laser - stimulated breit - wheeler process , one can generate positron energy combs . for the parameters considered in this paper , we demonstrate a possibility of generating positron combs in the energy region of tens of gev . note that gev positrons were produced in slac experiment  @xcite .",
    "this required the generation of a high - energy photon , which then collided with a strong laser beam .",
    "a 29gev photon was produced by scattering 46.6gev electrons off a 527 nm laser light with intensity of 10@xmath0w/@xmath1 ( for other parameters , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the same laser beam was used in the following step , i.e. , in the nonlinear breit - wheeler process . note that the parameters used throughout this paper are in the regime accessible to the slac experiment .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] , we present the theoretical formulation of the nonlinear breit - wheeler process which is along the lines presented in our previous paper  @xcite . in section  [ shape ] , we introduce the laser pulse shape for which numerical calculations are performed .",

    "[ diffraction ] , we provide a theoretical explanation of comb - like structures in the positron energy spectra , observed in section  [ numerics ] . a brief summary of our results is given in section  [ conclusions ] .",

    "[ kappa2],title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    we have shown that , within the finite energy interval of product particles , equally separated and very narrow peaks in their spectra can be produced .",
    "this specifically concerns figs .",
    "[ bwcomb20130322par ] and  [ bwcomb20130322per ] . on the other hand ,",
    "we have seen from fig .",
    "[ ssll2 ] , which spans a large interval of positron energy , that the enhancement peaks are distributed in a nonuniform way .",
    "this is confirmed by plotting the dependence of @xmath182 , given by eq .",
    ", on the positron energy . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ kappa2 ] we plot this dependence for the parameters corresponding to fig .  [ bwc11 ] .",
    "we see that for the considered range of positron energies , @xmath182 passes through three integer values .",
    "this happens for the exact same positron energies for which we observe comb maxima in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ bwc11 ] .",
    "increasing the range of positron energies such that it corresponds to fig .",
    "[ bwcomb20130322par ] , @xmath182 still shows the same linear dependence on @xmath193 .",
    "however , in general , @xmath182 depends on the positron energy in a nonlinear way , which can be observed when looking at a large enough energy interval .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ kappa2 ] , which corresponds to the data collected in fig .",
    "[ ssll2 ] .",
    "we observe that with increasing the positron energy the @xmath182-curve becomes steeper , resulting in a denser distribution of enhancement peaks . because the same @xmath182 relates to modulated driving pulses with @xmath154 and @xmath194 , we observe the enhancement peaks at the same positron energies , independent of @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , the same curve corresponds to an unmodulated driving pulse as well ( @xmath153 ) , since @xmath195 however , for the reason we have already explained , we do not observe the comb maxima for @xmath153 .",
    "we have demonstrated , how by means of the nonlinear breit - wheeler process , one can produce coherent energy comb structures of positrons ( electrons ) .",
    "this requires the use of modulated laser pulses , with at least two repetitions . as shown by our numerical results , and confirmed analytically , these energy combs are coherent .",
    "this allows for a very intuitive interpretation of the observed comb structures .",
    "namely , the probability amplitudes from each subpulse interfere constructively leading to enhancements at certain positron ( electron ) energies .",
    "thus , one could say that each subpulse acts as a slit in the young - type experiment of matter waves , performed by davisson and germer @xcite .",
    "we remark also that similar comb structures were observed in both photon and matter domains , using nonlinear compton scattering  @xcite .",
    "however , the comb generation of anti - matter has been demonstrated in this paper for the first time . as we have shown here ,",
    "the comb structures extend toward gev energies , which makes it promising for synthesis of ultra - short bunches of anti - matter .    in closing",
    ", we note that pair production induced by a high energy nonlaser photon takes place in a very narrow cone around the propagation direction of the photon . in other words ,",
    "the positron beam is very well collimated around the direction of the incident nonlaser photon .",
    "a similar situation is met in nonlinear compton scattering , when well - collimated radiation is produced in the direction of energetic electron - target - beam  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "i.e. , for compton scattering and breit - wheeler pair production , calculations of angular distributions of product particles are very time - consuming .",
    "for this reason , in ref .",
    "@xcite we performed calculations using the classical theory of compton scattering , that relates to thomson scattering .",
    "a similar simplification can not be used in the case of the breit - wheeler process as it has no classical equivalent .",
    "the corresponding quantum calculations for the breit - wheeler process are currently being performed and their results will be published in due course .",
    "however , based on our recent experience regarding compton and thomson scattering  @xcite , we expect that even after integrating the differential positron distributions over a small solid angle , the structure of positron energy combs will still be preserved .",
    "thus , we anticipate that well - resolved combs in the anti - matter domain should be detectable experimentally .",
    "this is expected to happen due to a high collimation of positrons produced by highly energetic nonlaser photons .",
