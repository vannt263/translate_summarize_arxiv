    "since its discovery as a conventional bcs superconductor with an unexpectedly high superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath8 ) of 39 k , @xcite mgb@xmath4  has been studied intensely over the last four years , and many of its properties are now well understood . as such",
    ", it was established very early that mgb@xmath4  has four separate sheets at the fermi surface , two of them being degenerate and corresponding to a 2-dimensional @xmath6  band and two comprising 3-dimensional @xmath7  bands .",
    "@xcite the different electron - phonon coupling strengths of these bands lead to two distinct superconducting gaps , with the @xmath6  band gap having the higher electron - phonon coupling and thus being the main contributor to the unusually high @xmath8 .",
    "it was further shown that @xmath8 could be decreased significantly by replacing mg with al or b with c , @xcite which was explained by many different mechanisms ranging from band - filling,@xcite to a merging of the superconducting gaps,@xcite to increased interband scattering and a decrease in the electron - phonon coupling strength.@xcite while many different mechanisms are now being discussed in the literature , there has not yet been any consistent explanation for the loss of @xmath8 for al- or c doped mgb@xmath4 .",
    "it was previously shown that adding electrons to mgb@xmath4 , by doping with al or c , reduces the bond length ( i.e. the unit - cell volume decreases as a function of doping concentration ) , which lowers the density of states ( dos ) and simultaneously stiffens the available phonon modes.@xcite however , the effect of decreased lattice parameters , as evidenced by measurements of @xmath8 vs pressure does not by itself explain the full @xmath8 decrease measured for al- or c - doped mgb@xmath4.@xcite alternative mechanisms for the decrease of @xmath8 , such as increased interband scattering due to the doping atoms or band filling , have been proposed but no experimental evidence has been reported . indeed , initial band structure calculations for al- and c doped mgb@xmath4  suggested that the decrease in @xmath8 can be understood by simple band - filling , caused by the extra electrons provided to the system.@xcite although the effects of al- and c doping on @xmath8 and the superconducting gaps seem to be remarkably similar , other superconducting properties , such as the upper critical field ( @xmath10 ) show completely different behavior .",
    "in particular , it was shown that @xmath10  is dramatically increased in both poly - crystalline mg(b@xmath2c@xmath3)@xmath4 and especially in thin - film samples.@xcite on the other hand , mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath4  shows only a weak increase in @xmath10  for small concentrations of al , and otherwise a significant decrease.@xcite    kortus et al.@xcite pointed out that the experimental data on both doped and `` pure '' mgb@xmath4  show a large spread of properties , e.g. @xmath8 of 10% c - doped mgb@xmath4  ranges between 12k and 34k depending on the synthesis and annealing conditions . moreover",
    ", the exact doping concentration of the mgb@xmath4  grains is not measured directly in most studies , but rather measurements that average over many grains are performed .",
    "therefore , a systematic study of the effects of c- and al doping on the electronic structure and the superconducting properties , with doping concentrations measured inside the mg@xmath0al@xmath1(b@xmath2c@xmath3)@xmath4  grains , is needed to fully understand its complex structure - property relationships .",
    "also , most conventional electronic - structure measurements , such as x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) , can not study individual grains or distinguish between different crystallographic orientations , since no * large * single crystals of al- or c doped mgb@xmath4  have been available to date .",
    "thus , we need to use electronic structure probes that are significantly smaller than the grain size of mg@xmath0al@xmath1(b@xmath2c@xmath3)@xmath4  in order to accurately measure the effects of doping on the local dos and its anisotropy .    in this paper , we explore the electronic structure of al- and c doped mgb@xmath4  by combined high - resolution z - contrast imaging and electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) in a scanning transmission electron microscope ( stem ) .",
    "our previous work @xcite showed how these two techniques can be used to study the electronic structure of individual grains of mgb@xmath4 ; here we apply them to quantify the changes as a function of either al- or c doping .",
    "in particular , orientation resolved eels will allow us to distinguish the behavior of the @xmath7  and @xmath6  band for the different doping concentrations .",
    "the samples of mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath4  and mg(b@xmath2c@xmath3)@xmath4  were previously characterized for their superconducting properties;@xcite we will correlate the changes in the measured electronic structure with these properties .",
    "moreover , we use first - principles calculations to compare the changes in the eels spectra to those in density of unoccupied b @xmath11 states for the different doping concentrations , and explore the filling of the @xmath6  band close to the fermi - level .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained using a jeol3000f transmission electron microscope ( tem ) , equipped with an ultra high resolution ( uhr ) objective lens pole piece , a fischione high - angle annular dark - field ( haadf ) detector , a post column gatan imaging filter ( gif ) , and a noran x - ray detector .",
    "the instrument is capable of being operated in either the conventional tem or scanning tem ( stem ) mode . for the atomic resolution imaging and analysis results shown here ,",
    "the incoherent haadf imaging mode ( or z - contrast imaging ) in the stem was used exclusively .",
    "the key to atomic resolution in stem microscopy@xcite is the formation of the smallest possible electron probe with sufficient probe current ( 40 pa ) to obtain statistically significant images and spectra .",
    "the electron probe is optimized using the electron `` ronchigram , '' or `` shadow image '' ( for a more detailed description see refs .  , ) , to obtain a probe - size of @xmath12 1.5   for these experiments .",
    "the experimental setup of this microscope allows the low - angle scattered electrons to be used , which do not contribute to the z - contrast image , for electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels).@xcite as the two techniques do not interfere , this means that z - contrast images can be used to position the electron probe at the desired spot on the sample while acquiring spectra.@xcite the lens conditions in the microscope and spectrometer were set up for the smallest probe size , with a convergence angle ( @xmath13 ) of 11 mrad , a detector inner angle of 30 mrad , and an eels spectrometer collection angle ( @xmath14 ) of 25 mrad .",
    "the physical principle behind eels relates the interaction of fast electrons with the sample to cause either collective excitations of electrons in the conduction bands ( plasmons ) or discrete transitions between atomic energy levels.@xcite in this study we will focus on the the latter class , using boron ( b ) @xmath5 edge core - loss spectra , which is comprised of transitions from the b @xmath15-states into the unoccupied b @xmath16-states above the fermi - energy ( @xmath17 ) . in the experiment performed here , eel spectra of the b @xmath5 edge are acquired directly from grains in the [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] orientations with an acquisition time of 3 s per spectrum .",
    "the experimental spectra shown here are a sum of 15 individual spectra , added to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of the near - edge fine structure . further , unless stated otherwise the background is subtracted from each spectrum and the resulting data are further deconvoluted with the zero - loss peak to remove the effects of plural scattering from the core - loss spectra,@xcite .",
    "the simulated eels spectra shown in this paper are calculated using first - principles methods based on density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite we used the newly updated ` telnes.2 ` package included in the ` wien2k ` code,@xcite a full - potential linear augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) plus local - orbitals method within dft .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) proposed by perdew , burke and ernzerhof @xcite was used for the exchange correlation .",
    "muffin - tin radii ( @xmath18 ) were 2.00 bohr for mg , and 1.65 bohr for b , and @xmath19 was taken to be 7.0 .",
    "the angular momentum ( @xmath20 ) expansion up to @xmath21 for the potential and charge density representations was used in the calculations . at convergence ,",
    "the integrated difference between input and output charge densities was less than @xmath22 .",
    "for all structures , 252 @xmath23-points in the irreducible brillouin zone were used in the calculations .",
    "we used the experimental lattice parameters , as given in table [ tab : samples ] , in our calculations of the eels fine - structure for the different doping concentrations .",
    "the mg@xmath0al@xmath1(b@xmath2c@xmath3)@xmath4  samples for this study where prepared using various reaction and sintering conditions to create material with a homogeneous distribution of the doping element , minimize secondary phases such as mgb@xmath24 , mgo , alb@xmath25 or mgc@xmath25 , and to maximize the grain size . here",
    ", we will only briefly describe the different sintering conditions for the various samples , while more detailed descriptions can be found elsewhere.@xcite undoped mgb@xmath4  and mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath4  samples were prepared in a high - temperature process that lasted for nearly 96 hrs , with thorough annealing to obtain homogeneity .",
    "initially , the appropriate mixture of mg , b , and al powders were heated to 1200@xmath26c and kept at this temperature for 1 h. the temperature was then decreased to 700@xmath26c at a rate of @xmath27 and kept at 700@xmath26c for 5 hrs . finally , the sample was brought to room temperature at a rate of @xmath28.@xcite the resulting materials have an average grain - size of @xmath29 and do not show show a significant number of impurity or secondary phases .    the mg(b@xmath30c@xmath31)@xmath4  sample was prepared from a carbon - doped b fiber by ames laboratory.@xcite the mg(b@xmath32c@xmath33)@xmath4  sample was made by mixing the appropriate ratio of mg and b@xmath24c powders and subsequently heating it to 950@xmath26c for 1 h followed by slow cooling .",
    "x - ray diffraction analysis of this material showed the presence of a small concentration of mg@xmath4c@xmath34 impurity phases .",
    "for all the samples studied here , we found that the doping concentration within the grains that were studied appears to be homogeneous , and no ordering of the dopants was found in any sample .",
    "we found that the precise doping concentration varies slightly from grain to grain , in particular , in those samples with shorter sintering time .",
    "we used edx and eels analyses to determine the doping concentration of the individual grains probed , and the respective doping concentration given for each sample in this paper applies only to the individual grains that were studied .",
    "figure [ fig : z - contrast ] shows an example of a typical high - resolution z - contrast image of a grain in the [ 001 ] projection found in mg@xmath35al@xmath36b@xmath4 .",
    "similar images can be obtained for all other doping concentrations .",
    "the bright spots in this image show the mg / al - columns in this projection of the mgb@xmath4  structure .",
    "due to the small scattering amplitude at large scattering angles , the b - columns are not visible in this image .",
    "since the image intensity is proportional to @xmath37 , and al ( @xmath38=13 ) is slightly heavier than mg ( @xmath38=12 ) , while c ( @xmath38=6 ) is slightly heavier than b ( z=5 ) , ordering or clustering of of the al- or c atoms would be visible in such z - contrast images as variations of the atomic column contrast .",
    "for instance , oxygen ordering in grains of mgb@xmath4  on the b sublattice was previously observed by similar z - contrast imaging.@xcite this makes it likely that ordering or clustering of dopants should also be visible here . from figure [ fig : z - contrast ] , which is shown here as a representation of all other doping concentrations , it can be clearly seen that no superstructure due to dopant ordering can be found .",
    "a summary of the properties of the different sample materials used in this study is given in table [ tab : samples ] .",
    "figures [ fig : al001-exp ] and [ fig : al110-ext ] shows the b @xmath5 edge core - loss eels spectra for the different al - doping concentrations .",
    "the spectra are aligned at the edge onset for undoped mgb@xmath4 , which is located at 186.0 ev and are further offset in the vertical direction to clearly show the differences in the near - edge fine - structure for the different doping concentrations . in this projection",
    "the experimental b @xmath5 edge spectrum contains three major features , or peaks within the first 20 ev above the edge onset . the small shoulder , or pre - peak intensity is labeled throughout this paper as peak _ a _ ;",
    "the pre - peak is followed by a shoulder of higher intensity at @xmath12 193 ev in pristine mgb@xmath4  and is labeled peak _",
    "b_. the main feature of the b @xmath5 edge , which is located at 202 ev , represents a broad peak without any further fine - structure and is labeled peak _",
    "c_. we have added three vertical lines to all the figures containing eels spectra , at the edge onset ( 186 ev ) , the position of peak _ b _ ( 193 ev ) and the broader peak _ c _ at 202 ev in pristine mgb@xmath4 . figure",
    "[ fig : al001-exp ] shows the spectra taken from mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath4  grains in the [ 001 ] projection .",
    "with increasing al concentration , it can be clearly seen from figure [ fig : al001-exp ] that peaks _ b _ and _ c _ are shifting towards lower energies .",
    "in addition , the peak intensities change for the different doping concentrations : the pre - edge peak intensity ( _ a _ ) decreases significantly for mg@xmath39al@xmath40b@xmath4  and is nearly completely vanished for mg@xmath35al@xmath36b@xmath4 .",
    "further , the intensity of peak _ c _ seems to be increased for both mg@xmath39al@xmath40b@xmath4  and mg@xmath35al@xmath36b@xmath4 .",
    "the spectra from grains in the [ 110 ] orientation ( figure [ fig : al110-ext ] ) are very different from those of the [ 001 ] orientation .",
    "the most obvious difference is the higher pre - peak intensity ( peak _ a _ ) in the [ 110 ] orientation compared to the the [ 001 ] orientation , and we have previously discussed these differences in the context of the two bands of the boron @xmath11 states in mgb@xmath4.@xcite however , the spectra in the [ 110 ] orientation show similar trends as seen in the [ 001 ] orientation , in particular the energy shifts of peaks _ b _ and _ c _ as well as the decrease in the intensity of the pre - edge peak _ a_. while this pre - edge peak intensity decreases as a function of al doping , it is still clearly visible for mg@xmath35al@xmath36b@xmath4 . in undoped",
    "mgb@xmath4 , peak _ b _ is clearly visible , while for mg@xmath35al@xmath36b@xmath4  it is barely noticeable as a shoulder at @xmath12 191.8 ev .    figure [ fig : al001-dft ] and [ fig : al110-ext ] show the calculated eels spectra for mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath4  in the [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] orientation using the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) . unlike previously published spectra",
    ", these calculations take into consideration the experimental unit - cell volume which might be considerably different from the calculated ones , and this results in significant changes of the near - edge fine structure of the calculated spectra . the theoretical spectra shown here",
    "are smoothed by a gaussian function with 0.8 ev width at half - maximum to simulate the instrument resolution .",
    "the simulated eels spectrum for undoped mgb@xmath4  shows good agreement with the experimental results , in that the positions of peaks _ a _ and _ b _ are reproduced accurately , as well as decrease in intensity of peak _ a _ for increasing al concentration .",
    "for the [ 001 ] orientation ( figure [ fig : al001-dft ] ) , the energy - position of peak _ c _ is slightly higher in the calculated spectra , and the energy shift of peaks _ b _ and _ c _ appears to be slightly smaller than in the experimental spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : al110-dft ] shows more structure of the pre - peak _ a _ than seen in the experimental spectra , and peak _ b _ is not distinguishable from the broader shoulder that appears at 198.5 ev in the calculated spectrum of pristine mgb@xmath4 .",
    "this peak is not visible in the experimental spectra , and the intensity of peak _ c _ at 201.5 ev is underestimated by the theoretical spectra .",
    "however , the peak at 198.5 ev becomes stronger and more distinct with increasing al concentration , while no changes can be seen for the peak at 201.5 ev .",
    "the b @xmath5 edge eels spectra for c doped mgb@xmath4  are shown in figure [ fig : c001-exp ] and [ fig : c110-ext ] , where undoped mgb@xmath4  is compared to mg(b@xmath30c@xmath31)@xmath4  and mg(b@xmath32c@xmath33)@xmath4  in the two crystal orientations , [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] . similar to the al doped samples , the b @xmath5 edge in c - doped mgb@xmath4  shows a measurable decrease in the peak intensity of the pre - peak _ a _ in both crystal orientations , and a small shift of peak _ b _ in the spectra from mg(b@xmath2c@xmath3)@xmath4  grains as the c concentration is increased .",
    "while peak _ c _ shifts downwards in energy for mg(b@xmath32c@xmath33)@xmath4 there is no noticeable shift of peak _ c _ in mg(b@xmath30c@xmath31)@xmath4 .",
    "however , with increasing c doping concentration one can observe an increase in the intensity of peak _ c _ , which is located at 202 ev in pristine mgb@xmath4 .",
    "the spectra from grains in the [ 110 ] orientation ( figure [ fig : c110-ext ] ) show a shift in energy of peak _ b _ , but no measurable shift of peak _ c _ as a function of c doping . in addition to this shift ,",
    "peak _ b _ ( at 193.5 ev in mgb@xmath4 ) becomes more distinguishable for higher c concentrations , a similar trend can be seen for the broader peak _",
    "c_.    the results of the dft calculations for c doped mgb@xmath4  in the [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] orientation , shown in figure [ fig : c001-dft ] and [ fig : c110-dft ] , are in general agreement with the experimental spectra . in calculation",
    "these spectra , the vca was used and the resulting spectra were broadened by 0.8 ev to match the experimental energy resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : c001-dft ] shows the decrease in the pre - peak intensity ( peak _ a _ ) with increasing c concentration and a small shift of peak _ c _ towards lower energy for mg(b@xmath32c@xmath33)@xmath4 .",
    "however , the calculated spectra show an intensity of peak _ b _ that is significantly lower than measured experimentally .",
    "the calculations for the [ 110 ] orientations ( figure [ fig : c110-dft ] ) show a decrease in the pre - peak intensity , and reflect the positions of peak _ b _ adequately .",
    "however , the neither the position of peaks _ c _ nor the shape and intensity of peak _ b _ are not reproduced in the calculated spectra .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : al110-dft ] , the calculated spectra show an additional intensity at 198.5 ev , while underestimating the intensity of peak _",
    "c_. further , the peak at 198.5 ev increases in intensity as the c doping concentration is increased .",
    "while many of the general changes in the first 15 - 20 ev of the b @xmath5 edge fine structure are well reproduced by the dft calculations , the intensity of peak _ b _ at @xmath12 193 ev and peak _ c _ in teh [ 110 ] orientation are only poorly reflected in the theoretical spectra .",
    "we have previously shown that the peak at193 ev is correlated to oxygen rich areas in mgb@xmath4 or even amorphous @xmath41 principates or surfaces layers.@xcite since we could not observe any superlattice structure in the mgb@xmath4  grains that would indicate o inside the mgb@xmath4  grain , it is reasonable to assume that the exposure of the samples to air has caused the formation of an amorphous boron - oxide layer at the top and bottom surfaces .",
    "the shift of this peak at @xmath12 193.0 ev is an artifact of the post - acquisition energy - scale alignment , and further indicates a shift in the fermi - level upon doping mgb@xmath4  with electron .",
    "in order to interpret the changes in the b @xmath5 edge fine - structure as a function of al and c doping , a complete understanding of the orientation dependance of the b @xmath5 edge is needed .",
    "it has been shown previously that the b @xmath5 edge near - edge fine - structure of mgb@xmath4  will change significantly as a function of grain orientation with respect to the incoming electron probe ( as shown in figure [ fig : al001-exp ] , [ fig : al110-ext ] or figures [ fig : c001-exp ] and [ fig : c110-ext ] ) due to the fact that mgb@xmath4  is an anisotropic material.@xcite since mgb@xmath4  is a layered compound with graphite - like layer of b atoms and intercalated mg layers , the orientation of the electron probe with respect to these layer can excite different transitions as the angle between the electron probe and the 2-dimensional b layer changes .",
    "we have previously shown that two crystal orientations , [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] ( i.e.  perpendicular and parallel to the hexagonal b - layers ) are sufficient to separate the contributions of the boron @xmath6  and the @xmath7  bands.@xcite for eels core - loss spectra that have been acquired from mgb@xmath4  grains in the [ 001 ] projection , we have shown the majority of the spectral contribution ( @xmath42 ) stems from the transitions perpendicular to the incoming beam direction , i.e. promoting the b 1s - electron into the unoccupied @xmath6  band . for grains in the [ 110 ] orientation ,",
    "only half the observed intensity comes from those @xmath6  band transitions , the other half is made up by transitions into the @xmath7-band .",
    "this can be understood by considering the fact that we use a highly convergent electron probe and a large spectrometer acceptance angle , which means that there is significant momentum transfer into transition perpendicular to the incoming beam direction.@xcite    figure [ fig : dft ] shows the density of states ( dos ) in the vicinity of @xmath17 as computed by dft for undoped mgb@xmath4 .",
    "the unoccupied @xmath6  states have high intensity at @xmath17 that drops to zero within 0.8 ev above @xmath17 .",
    "the dos of the @xmath6-band then remains low up to @xmath125 ev above @xmath17 and finally increases to form the @xmath43-peak at 192.0 ev .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath7  states have a nearly flat distribution of the dos as the energy increases from 186 ev to 193 ev , with the exception of the small peak at 189 ev .",
    "as described above , any experimental eels spectrum will contain contribution from both of those bands,@xcite which means that the pre - peak in the experimental spectra contains transitions from the b @xmath15 states into the sum of the high density of unoccupied @xmath6  and the flat @xmath7  states at @xmath17 , while peak _ b _ contains transitions into the @xmath43  at @xmath12 192 ev .",
    "the changes in the b @xmath5 edge fine - structure for the different crystal orientations can be best understood by a varying mixture of the @xmath6  and the @xmath7  states to the total b @xmath5 edge spectrum .",
    "the superconducting properties of mgb@xmath4 , in particular @xmath8 , are strongly correlated to the high density of @xmath6-states close to the fermi - level , and the the dominance of these transitions in the spectra from the [ 001 ] orientation gives us a unique experimental window , through which the electronic structure important for superconductivity can be accessed .",
    "it is widely believed that filling of these @xmath6-states by electron doping will decrease the density of superconducting carriers ( which are holes ) , and thus @xmath8 should decrease .",
    "the filling of the empty @xmath11 states will results in an increase in the fermi level , and one would expect that @xmath44 once all the @xmath6-states are filled ( i.e. the fermi - level shifted by more than 0.8 ev ) this shift in the fermi level should result in a chemical shift of the b @xmath5 edge as well as a decrease in the pre - edge peak intensity . indeed , this is exactly what is seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : al001-exp ] and [ fig : c001-exp ] .    to quantify the changes in the b @xmath5 edge , we will use the spectra from the [ 001 ] orientation only , since they provide us with the majority of @xmath6-states transitions , and either the chemical shift or the pre - peak intensity can be used to correlate the hole - state density to the superconducting properties .",
    "however , since the energy - resolution of the experimental eels",
    "spectra is only @xmath121.0 ev and a chemical shift of 0.8 ev is sufficient to fill most of the available @xmath6-states , we will use the pre - peak intensity as a more reliable measure .",
    "a gaussian function was used to fit the pre - edge peak at 0 - 1 ev above @xmath17 , three more gaussian functions were then used to fit the remaining peaks of the b @xmath5 edge .",
    "figure [ fig : fit ] shows the spectrum for undoped mgb@xmath4  and a fit of the experimental data using four gaussians of varying width and intensity .",
    "the pre - peak intensity of the experimental spectrum consists of a gaussian located at 186 ev , while the @xmath43  peak is formed by one gaussian at 192 ev and a broader gaussian at 195 ev .",
    "similarly , we have fitted all the experimental spectra of the different al- and c doping concentrations shown in figures [ fig : al001-exp ] and [ fig : c001-exp ] .",
    "figure [ fig : prepeak vs doping ] shows the relative pre - peak intensity as calculated from the gaussian fits for the different al- and c - doping concentrations .",
    "the pre - peak intensity is normalized to the fitted @xmath43-peak intensity to account for variations in sample thickness or acquisition times .",
    "similarly , we have fitted four gaussian functions to all the calculated spectra shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : al001-dft ] and [ fig : c001-dft ] .",
    "we can clearly see that within the experimental uncertainty the pre - peak intensities for both al and c - doped decrease linearly with increasing doping concentration , and the least square fit is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : prepeak vs doping ] .",
    "thus , for the first time there is direct spectroscopic evidence that band filling occurs as mgb@xmath4  is doped with electrons . extrapolating the linear fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : prepeak vs doping ] , one will find that relative pre - peak intensity will vanish completely at @xmath45 40% al - doping or @xmath4620% c .",
    "this means that all the empty @xmath6-states close to @xmath17 will be filled completely at @xmath47 40% al - doping , thus resulting in a collapse of the high - temperature 2-band superconductivity in mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath4.@xcite it has been previously reported that @xmath48 ( the al - composition at which @xmath49)is at @xmath12 33 - 40% .",
    "however , @xmath50 ( the c - composition at which @xmath49 ) has been measured to be @xmath12 12 - 15 % .@xcite this means that within the experimental uncertainties @xmath51 , but @xmath52 .",
    "this means that , although the changes in the b @xmath5 edge spectra for al and c - doped mgb@xmath4  appear to be very similar , there seems to be a fundamental difference in the mechanism that governs the measured loss of superconductivity in doped mgb@xmath4  for these dopants .",
    "the drop in @xmath8 with increasing al concentration can be successfully explained in terms of band filling , while the simple band - filling picture appears to underestimate the decrease in @xmath8 in c - doped mgb@xmath4 .",
    "similarly , kortus et al.@xcite reported that the larger decrease of @xmath8 in c - doped mgb@xmath4  can be explained by an increased interband scattering rate , while the effect of al - doping on @xmath8 is simply due to band - filling .",
    "further , the authors ague that the two superconducting gaps in mg(b@xmath2c@xmath3)@xmath4  merge , resulting in an additional lowering of @xmath8 of about 6 k in mgb@xmath4  with 10%-15% c - doping .    for a more in - depth",

    "the band structure ( fig .  [ fig : bandstructure - al ] ) reveals some further details related to the changes in the electronic structure upon al - doping . here",
    ", the high intensity at @xmath17 in the @xmath6-band corresponds to the flat band close to the fermi - level between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , while the @xmath43-peak corresponds to the flat band @xmath12 6 ev above @xmath17 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that with increasing al - concentration the @xmath6-band close to @xmath17 shifts lower in energy and at 25% the band at @xmath53 is nearly completely submerged under the fermi - level .",
    "the density of states at the @xmath53 point is particularly important , since it is these states at the brillouin zone ( bz ) center that couple to the @xmath55 phonons and create the high @xmath8 .",
    "further , the @xmath43-band appears to be shifting faster in energy than the bands close to @xmath17 as the al - concentration increases , thus indicating a non - rigid shift of the @xmath6  bands applies . on the other hand , there appears to hardly any shift of the @xmath7-bands , which are located at @xmath5 in the bz .",
    "interestingly , this means that the extra electrons provided by the al substituting for mg fill only the @xmath6  hole - states rather than the @xmath7  band .",
    "therefore , this filling of the @xmath6  states , albeit non - rigid , can account for the decrease in @xmath8 that was previously reported .",
    "@xcite    the dos for the @xmath7  and the @xmath6-states of c - doped mgb@xmath4  are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos - c ] .",
    "similarly to dos of mg@xmath0al@xmath1b@xmath4 the high intensity in the @xmath6-states close to the fermi - level is decreasing significantly upon c - doping . while the hole - states at @xmath17 shift below the fermi - level with increasing c - concentration , the @xmath43-peak at @xmath126 ev above @xmath17 does not seem to shift at all .",
    "however , the large peak in the @xmath6-dos at 17.5 ev shows several changes with increasing c concentration . the high intensity at 17.5 ev is decreasing in energy to 16.5 ev in mg@xmath35al@xmath36b@xmath4 , while the less intense peak 18.2 ev in mgb@xmath4  increases significantly in intensity to form the largest peak in the @xmath6-dos in mg@xmath35al@xmath36b@xmath4 .",
    "these changes can explain the apparent shift of peak _ c _ fig .",
    "[ fig : c001-exp ] . the band structure for mgb@xmath4 , mg@xmath39al@xmath40b@xmath4 , and mg@xmath35al@xmath36b@xmath4  ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandstructure - c ] ) further highlights the changes seen in the experiments and in the dos .",
    "firstly , the flat @xmath6-band close to @xmath17 is slowly shifting below the fermi - level with increasing c - concentration , resulting in the @xmath6-band nearly reaching @xmath17 at the @xmath53-point for mg@xmath35al@xmath36b@xmath4 .",
    "however , the @xmath43-band does not seem to shift at all in energy for higher c - doping .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath7-band can be seen to shift downward by @xmath56 ev at @xmath5 for mg@xmath35al@xmath36b@xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to the band - filling picture for al - doping , the shifts of both the @xmath6- and the @xmath7-bands close to @xmath17 in c - doped mgb@xmath4  indicate that the additional electrons provided by the c atoms replacing b fill both the @xmath7  and the @xmath6-states at the fermi - level .",
    "this filling of both bands in the case of c - doping can explain why the relative pre - peak intensity of the b @xmath5 edge overestimates the amount of c needed for @xmath8 to reach 0 k.",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the combination of high - resolution z - contrast imaging and eels can be used to study the effects of electron doping on the @xmath6- and the @xmath7  band of the 2-band superconductor mgb@xmath4 .",
    "we have further shown that substituting either c for b , or al for mg does not results in any long - range ordered superstructures visible by tem , in contrast to previously reports for high concentration of al - doping concentrations.@xcite additionally , eels - spectroscopy revealed that the effect of electron doping on the electronic structure of mgb@xmath4  is very similar for either dopant , while the superconducting transport properties of both sample are significantly different .",
    "we have presented both theoretical and experimental evidence that doping mgb@xmath4  with electrons on the mg and on the b - sites results filling the @xmath6  hole - states close to the fermi - level , and thus a increase in the fermi - level energy .",
    "this filling of the superconducting hole - state in the @xmath6  band with increasing doping concentration has been shown to be closely linked to the disappearance of the @xmath6  band superconductivity once all these states are filled .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the band - filling for al and c - doping does not occur in a rigid band fashion ; the @xmath43-bands in al - doped mgb@xmath4  shift faster than than @xmath6-bands close to @xmath17 , while in c - doped mgb@xmath4  the @xmath43-bands remain constant and the @xmath6-bands close the the fermi - level shift significantly .",
    "in addition , our results clearly show that selective doping on either the mg or the b - site affects both bands of the b @xmath11-states .",
    "more specifically , it was previously shown that there is a significant charge - transfer of electrons from the b - planes towards the mg - planes@xcite and adding extra electrons on either lattice site should result in filling of both the @xmath6- and the @xmath7  band .",
    "interestingly , we could show that only c - doping results in a measurable filling of the @xmath7-band , while al - doping does not influence the @xmath7-band dos at all .",
    "finally , we have presented experimental and theoretical evidence that the reduction of @xmath8 for both al and c - doped mgb@xmath4  can be explained in large parts by the band - filling mechanism alone .",
    "although an increase in inter - band scattering is not needed to explain the drop in @xmath8 of our mg@xmath0al@xmath1(b@xmath2c@xmath3)@xmath4  samples , we can not affirmatively exclude effects such as increased inter - band scattering , local clustering of c atoms or the buckling of c - doped boron planes to occur in mg(b@xmath2c@xmath3)@xmath4  and cause a further decrease @xmath8 .",
    "however , in contrast to al - doped mgb@xmath4 , the addition of c to mgb@xmath4  has been shown to increase the upper critical field ( @xmath10 ) significantly , which can be explained by the increase electron - hole scattering in the b - planes and also results in a decrease in @xmath8 .",
    "our results presented in this paper suggest that adding additional hole on the mg - sites by doping for example with na to off - set the negative effects of c - doping on the @xmath6-band , while keeping the c on the b - site to increase @xmath10  but without the loss of @xmath8 , thus resulting in a new high - field , high-@xmath8 superconductor",
