    "a canonical quantum theory for the gravitational field is performed starting from an hamiltonian formulation , hence from the definition of a space - time splitting .",
    "a criticism to this approach is that it is based on the identification of a time - like vector field ; but it is expected that , once the geometry has been quantized , only a probabilistic response can be given for a vector to be time - like or space - like . a physical way to introduce a space - time splitting of the space - time is to include in the dynamics a real fluid . by virtue of the matter - time dualism @xcite , the introduction of matter provides a solution to the time - problem in quantum gravity @xcite . here",
    "the link between the identification of a reference and the appearance of a matter term is investigated from the point of view of lagrangian symmetries .",
    "in particular , we are going to discuss the dynamical implications of the covariance principle when it is restricted to a synchronous frame of reference .",
    "the hamiltonian constraints will be inferred , showing how fixing the reference leads to the materialization of a dust - like contribution .",
    "finally , the description of a generic cosmological model will be given , together with the picture of a quantum to classical transition for the adopted evolutionary approach .",
    "a synchronous ( gaussian ) reference frame is characterized by a metric tensor having the following fixed components @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , as soon as a 3 + 1 splitting @xmath3 of the full space - time manifold is performed .",
    "this feature implies @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the lapse function and for the shift vector , respectively , in the adm formalism .",
    "it can be shown that the synchronous character is preserved by the following set of restricted coordinate transformations @xcite ,    @xmath6    @xmath7 and @xmath8 being three generic space functions .    by restricting the invariance requirement for the lagrangian ,",
    "one finds the following set of constraints , replacing the super - hamiltonian and the super - momentum ones ,    @xmath9    @xmath10 being a scalar density of weight @xmath11 , hence it can be written as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 a scalar function .",
    "these expressions outline that , while the super - momentum constraint is not modified , in fact the invariance under 3-difeomorphisms still stands , the super - hamiltonian is non - vanishing , in order to preserve the synchronous character of the reference .    the modification induced on the form of constraints",
    "can be interpreted as the emergence of a dust fluid co - moving with the slicing , whose energy density is given by the function @xmath13 .",
    "einstein equations underlying such a picture read @xmath14 @xmath15 being orthogonal to the space - like slicing .",
    "one can think at this contribution as the physical realization of the synchronous reference .",
    "however , it is clear that we are not dealing with an external matter field since the energy density @xmath13 is not always positive and @xmath16 is fixed , once initial conditions are assigned on a non - singular hypersurface .",
    "we perform the quantization of the synchronous gravitational field by promoting the 3-geometry @xmath17 and its conjugated momentum @xmath18 to operators acting on the state function @xmath19 in a canonical way , _",
    "@xmath20    the constraints are implemented according with the dirac prescription , hence they read as follows    @xmath21    the condition ( [ 2 ] ) implies that the wave functional depends on the 3-geometries @xmath22 , not on 3-metrics .",
    "but a relevant achievement is the relation ( [ 1 ] ) : @xmath23 being the generators of time displacements , it fixes an evolutionary character for wave functional , which can be described by the schrdinger equation    @xmath24    therefore , the quantum features of the dust contribution outline its behavior as a clock - like matter .",
    "the next task is to find out a negative portion of the super - hamiltonian spectrum , which allows to interpret the additional contribution as a physical matter field .    in this respect ,",
    "a change of variables is performed on the 3-metric and it is written as    @xmath25    with @xmath26 and @xmath27 . + this way the hamiltonian density takes the form    @xmath28    @xmath29 and @xmath30 being the conjugate momenta to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .    here , the potential term @xmath33 comes from the 3-ricci scalar and @xmath34 refers to first and second order spatial gradients .",
    "in this scheme , equations ( [ 1 ] ) can be written as    @xmath35    @xmath36    this equation has a klein - gordon - like structure , hence there exist solutions with negative values of @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth noting that in a synchronous reference the metric determinant always vanishes monotonically at a time @xmath37 where all the geodesics lines cross each other , i.e @xmath38 , with @xmath39 ( as a consequence of the landau - raichoudhuri theorem ) .",
    "this property supports i)@xmath40 as an internal time , ii ) to take the limit @xmath41 , where the system ( [ newhaux ] ) admits an asymptotic solution .",
    "in fact , in this limit , the potential term turns out to be drastically suppressed with respect to the term @xmath42 , thus the dynamics of different spatial points decouples and the quantization can be performed in a local minisuperspace . + an approximated solution",
    "is provided in this scheme , point by point in space , by the following expression    @xmath43    @xmath44 and @xmath45 satisfying the two equations respectively    @xmath46    the potential results to be negligible , also on a quantum level , when the condition below holds @xmath47 a wider set of wave packets are in agreement with this condition , approaching @xmath48 .",
    "for instance , one of them is characterized by a deviation @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a small uncertainty around the picked value @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "indeed , this approach works only if @xmath51 is greater than a fiducial one @xmath53 and this is consistent with the prescription that a quantum - classical correspondence stands for high quantum numbers .    by writing @xmath54 ,",
    "the function @xmath55 obeys the following equation for the negative part of the spectrum @xmath56",
    "@xmath57    a solution is given for @xmath58 by    @xmath59    @xmath60 being the corresponding bessel functions , while @xmath61 and @xmath62 are two integration constants .",
    "therefore , a quantum range of positive energies exists for the dust contribution near enough to the `` singular '' point @xmath63 .",
    "however , there remain some open points : i ) the existence of a stable ground level of negative @xmath10 .",
    "ii ) the inclusion of spatial gradients of the dynamical variables .",
    "iii ) the physical meaning of the limit @xmath64 .",
    "iv ) the behavior of @xmath10 in the classical limit .",
    "most of these issues can be solved in a generic inhomogeneous cosmological setting , where the 3-metric is given by    @xmath65    with @xmath66 and @xmath67 six scalar functions and @xmath68 a @xmath69 matrix .",
    "the dynamics of different points decouples near the singularity and the schrdinger functional equation splits to the sum of @xmath70 independent point - like contributions as follows @xcite ( we denote by the subscript @xmath71 any minisuperspace quantity )    @xmath72\\psi _ x   - \\frac{3\\hbar ^2}{8\\pi } e^{-3\\alpha } \\partial ^2_{\\varphi } \\psi _ x - \\nonumber\\\\   - \\left ( \\frac{1}{2k\\mid j\\mid ^2}e^{\\alpha } v(\\beta _ { \\pm } ) - \\frac{\\lambda } { k}e^{3\\alpha } \\right )   \\psi _",
    "\\psi _ x = \\psi _ x ( t , \\ ; \\alpha , \\ ; \\beta _ { \\pm } , \\ ; \\varphi ) \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where a cosmological constant @xmath73 and a scalar field @xmath74 have been added to the dynamical description .",
    "if an integral representation is taken for the wave function @xmath75    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is fixed by the initial conditions at @xmath78 , the dynamics is given by    @xmath79 \\xi _ x = \\mathcal{e}_x\\xi _ x \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the expression above , it has been neglected any dependence of @xmath80 on @xmath81 because , asymptotically to the singularity ( @xmath82 ) , it has to be of higher order ( adiabatic approximation ) .",
    "let us now consider wave packets which are flat over the width @xmath83 ( @xmath84 being the standard deviation in the momenta space ) .    in the new variable @xmath85 ,",
    "the equation ( [ eigenvp2 ] ) reads    @xmath86    a solution to equation ( [ ph9 ] ) is provided by    @xmath87    @xmath88 being the characteristic length associated to the universe `` energy '' , while @xmath89 denotes the planck scale length .",
    "however , the validity of the solution above requires the condition @xmath90 .",
    "+ hence , the quantum dynamics in a fixed space point ( _ i.e. _ over a causal portion of the universe ) is described , in the considered approximation ( @xmath91 ) , by a free wave - packet for the variables @xmath92 and @xmath74 and by a profile in @xmath93 which has a maximum in @xmath94 .",
    "if a lattice structure for the space - time is assumed on the planckian scale @xcite , we can take @xmath95 and , noting that @xmath96 , we obtain    @xmath97    furthermore , to preserve the reality of @xmath10 , we have to impose that the square root above is real , hence we get @xmath98 . finally , from the request @xmath99 , then the inequality ( [ fininequa ] ) can be written as    @xmath100    @xmath101 being the planck mass .",
    "therefore , the existence of a cut - off implies that a ground state exists for the evolutionary approach .",
    "hence it is a natural request to assume the universe to approach this state during its evolution .    in order to infer the influence of the dust contribution on the cosmological evolution , we evaluate the associated critical parameter .",
    "being the super - hamiltonian a constant of motion and assuming the universe to be in the ground state , we find @xmath102 , with @xmath103 the present universe radius of curvature . since the actual critical density can be expressed as @xmath104)$ ] ( being @xmath105 the total universe critical parameter ) , then we have    @xmath106    therefore , the dust contribution can not play the role of dark matter .",
    "this conclusion can be modified by the introduction of matter from the thermal bath , which could have a relevant interaction with the universe in the trans - planckian region ( see the model addressed in @xcite , where ultrarelativistic matter and a perfect gas were included ) .",
    "we are going to discuss if a scenario can be defined where the transition to a classical regime happens , before the spatial curvature contribution becomes relevant .",
    "this way , the obtained spectrum of @xmath10 would result to be a good approximation during the whole cosmological evolution .",
    "where in the last equation it has been used the identification @xmath112 , coming out from the first one ( which is the hamilton - jacobi equation for the considered system ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the evolution of the wave function @xmath113 is described by a schrdinger equation .",
    "the dynamics for @xmath113 is that of a 3-dimensional non - relativistic free particle with the time variable given by @xmath116 .",
    "hence , if at the initial time @xmath113 is in the form of a sufficiently narrow packet , then it will remain peaked over the whole regime where our approximations hold .",
    "therefore , within the adopted evolutionary approach , _ it can be inferred a quasi - classical description for the universe volume , together with a quantum - like schrdinger dynamics for the anisotropies and the scalar field_. this feature demonstrate that a quantum - classical transition can be defined , where the dust contribution although being relevant during the planckian regime , nevertheless it becomes negligible in the classical phase .",
    "an open point remains the transition to a classical description for anisotropies and the scalar field . in this respect",
    "it could be significant the scalar curvature , which here has been neglected by the approximation scheme .",
    "in fact , such potential terms must approach a quadratic dependence on these variables , which allows to construct stable coherent states ."
