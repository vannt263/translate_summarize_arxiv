    "the ashkin - teller model , as a simple spin model exhibiting a critical line in its phase diagram , has been studied for many years .",
    "this model was introduced by ashkin and teller @xcite , and can be seen as two coupled ising models .",
    "some physical realisations of the ashkin - teller model are layers of molecules adsorbed on surfaces , such as selenium on nichel , molecular oxygen on graphite , and atomic oxygen on tungsten @xcite .",
    "the model can be mapped , on the square lattice , to the staggered @xmath0-vertex model , and the phase diagram and some of the critical exponents were found by mapping the model to the solid - on - solid ( sos ) model @xcite .",
    "although the phase diagram is qualitatively quite well known , the model has not been solved exactly for the generic coupling constants as the staggered @xmath0-vertex model has not been solved so far .",
    "the staggering of the model disappears on the critical line , where one can completely solve the model @xcite . the quantum version of the ashkin - teller model was also studied by considering the highly anisotropic model on the square lattice and has a different phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the continuum version of the model is as much complicated as the discrete version .",
    "it is related to the sine - gordon model @xcite on the critical line , see @xcite for more recent developments . on the critical line one can also write the action with respect to fermionic variables ( it is the massless thirring model @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding conformal field theory of the model on the critical line , called orbifold conformal field theory , was discussed in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the four - point correlation functions of the spin operators were also calculated exactly by conformal field theory methods @xcite .",
    "although in the physics community it is widely accepted that the above continuum models describe the critical line of the ashkin - teller model , there is no rigorous proof for the validity of the results .",
    "there was no systematic way to study the continuum limit , even for simpler systems such as percolation or ising models , before the invention of schramm - loewner evolution by schramm @xcite , for review see @xcite .",
    "this opened the way to investigate the continuum versions of the critical lines in statistical models .",
    "recently chelkak and smirnov showed that this method is also useful to investigate the universality of statistical models .",
    "they proved that the ising model on different iso - radial graphs , which will be discussed in section [ sec : ising_model_on_the_iso - radial_graphs ] , have the same continuum limit at criticality @xcite .",
    "the iso - radial graphs are important because they are the most generic graphs preserving some properties of complex analysis and have a well - defined continuum limit .",
    "they are also the most general graphs where one can expect conformal invariance , in the thermodynamic limit , for critical statistical models .",
    "these reasons are enough to stimulate theoretical physicists to investigate statistical models on iso - radial graphs .",
    "the study of statistical models on planar graphs was initiated by baxter @xcite .",
    "he introduced the most generic planar graphs such that the star - triangle relations ( or yang - baxter equations ) are well - defined for the eight vertex model .",
    "these graphs , now called baxter lattices , are those made of the union of simple non self - intersecting curves crossing the plane , with the property that a given curve can intersect any of the others at most once .",
    "iso - radial graphs are a special embedding of the baxter lattices .",
    "baxter solved the eight - vertex model @xcite and the potts model @xcite on these graphs . with the above motivations about the importance of iso - radial graphs",
    ", we will study the critical line of the ashkin - teller model on them .",
    "most of the studies on the ashkin - teller model are performed on the square lattice . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the formula for the critical line of the ashkin - teller model on the generic iso - radial graph is not written anywhere .    in this paper , by using the formula for the critical line of the anisotropic ashkin - teller model on the square lattice , we will find the critical surface on iso - radial graphs .",
    "the central claim is , the formula for the critical point of the model on the anisotropic square lattice is sufficient to find the critical point on the most generic iso - radial graph .",
    "this was already checked for the ising model in @xcite and for the fateev - zamolodchikov point of @xmath1 models @xcite in @xcite . here",
    "we will investigate its validity for the critical line of the ashkin - teller model .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : definition ] we define the ashkin - teller model and recall its different phases on the square lattice ; in section [ sec : ising_model_on_the_iso - radial_graphs ] we first review the general method for the ising model with arbitrary couplings on iso - radial graphs ; in section [ sec : anisotropic_ashkin - teller ] , by employing the method of section [ sec : ising_model_on_the_iso - radial_graphs ] , we introduce our conjecture for the critical line on iso - radial graphs , then , in section [ sec : montecarlo_triangular ] , we provide numerical calculations for the anisotropic triangular lattice in support of it .",
    "finally , in the last section we will conclude our findings and also discuss possible future investigations .",
    "the partition function of the ashkin - teller model is given by : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are ising variables , @xmath5 and @xmath6 run over all pairs of neighbouring sites , and the summation is over all possible configurations .",
    "one can write the above partition function with respect to complex variables as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 in this notation the @xmath10 symmetry of the ashkin - teller model is evident . since some of the forthcoming formulas have a simpler form in one or the other of the above notations , we will mostly provide them in both notations . the duality transformation in the @xmath11 , @xmath12 notation",

    "thick black lines are the boundary of the physical region and the red line is the self - dual line : it is critical between points p and t. @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are ising points . ]",
    "in this section we review the method employed in @xcite to extract the critical point of the ising model on iso - radial graphs starting from the critical point of the anisotropic square - lattice ising model . here",
    "we generalize the situation to the off - critical region as well .",
    "then , in the next section , by using the solution for the anisotropic square - lattice ashkin - teller model , we will derive the critical surface of this model on the generic iso - radial graph .    to see the importance of the anisotropy angle in the ising model ,",
    "consider a square lattice with different couplings in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions . to fix the notation",
    "write the partition function as : @xmath41 where the primed coordinates denote nearest - neighbours of @xmath42 in this case , in order to maintain invariance under lattice translations and reflection symmetry about the @xmath39 and @xmath40 axes , the only allowed transformations are relative scalings of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite . in our case",
    "each elementary square of the covering lattice is deformed into a rectangle . to proceed , we define disorder variables @xmath43 on the sites of the dual lattice , which is another rectangular lattice with vertices at the centers @xmath44 of the faces of the original lattice .",
    "the insertion of a disorder variable corresponds to modifying the weights so that the order variable @xmath45 has monodromy @xmath46 on taking the point @xmath47 in a closed circuit around @xmath44 .",

    "thus the disorder operator has the following form for the ising model : @xmath51 it is easy to see that the following equation is valid for two adjacent disorder variables : @xmath52 now consider the quadrilateral whose vertices are the two neighbouring spin variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 and the two neighbouring disorder variables @xmath55 and @xmath56 : this quadrilateral is living on the covering lattice . using eq .",

    "( [ equation_of_motion_2 ] ) and ( [ antiholomorphic_summation ] ) one obtains the following equation : @xmath67 the above relation is clearly similar to the equations of motion for a field theory of a free majorana fermion , i.  e.  : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the chiral components of the free majorana fermion .",
    "the comparison then yields : @xmath71 it is easy to see that @xmath72 for @xmath73 , and that @xmath58 is the discrete holomorphic operator .",

    "this gives a complete geometrical meaning to eq .",

    "nevertheless , duality must be respected even though , apparently , the boltzmann weights are not always positive numbers .",
    "indeed , a careful investigation reveals that the link - specific boltzmann weights combine in such a way that , due to the geometric shape of the lattice and some constraints on the allowed spin configurations , the total weight for a given configuration is always a real number , and the resulting partition function is a well - defined , real and positive object ( apart from a trivial overall prefactor ) .",
    "this situation can also be considered from a somewhat reversed point of view : starting from a statistical model on the honeycomb lattice with complex couplings and therefore ill - defined boltzmann weights , by making use of duality one can re - express all of the observables in a triangular - lattice version of the model , with well - defined , real and positive boltzmann weights ; moreover , the latter version of the original problem would now be open to numerical investigation .",
    "that would be the case , for instance , if one wanted to study the point with @xmath170 , i.  e.  the one corresponding to the twisted @xmath171 supersymmetric cft ; the triangular lattice is , moreover , the only way to perform numerical investigation in the vicinity of the @xmath172 point , which is accessible exclusively on this regularisation .",
    "this appendix provides some more formulas specific for the anisotropic triangular lattice with two equal sides ( section [ sec : montecarlo_triangular ] ) . from the parametrisation for the critical manifold , eqs .",
    "[ eq : happytree_expl_1 ] and [ eq : happytree_expl_2 ] , two linearly independent vectors tangent to the surface in a given point @xmath173 can be evaluated as : @xmath174 where the vectors are written as .",
    "the segments used to probe the susceptibility are then constructed along two orthogonal solutions @xmath175 to the system : @xmath176 the above tangent vectors are explicitly given by : @xmath177      \\big)\\;;\\nonumber \\\\",

    "this can be easily understood by considering that the two limits implement the removing of two or one of the sides of the triangle , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the first limit gives a system that is just a bundle of disconnected one - dimensional systems ( never getting a nonzero magnetisation ) , and the second results in a square lattice with isotropic couplings .",
    "we now provide three explicit `` iso-@xmath94 '' lines within the critical manifold ; the four - state potts model is given by : @xmath183 the f - z line is expressed as : @xmath184 and finally the ising sub - manifold is : @xmath185 these are found by imposing @xmath186 in eqs .",
