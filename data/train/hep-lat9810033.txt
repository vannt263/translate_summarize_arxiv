    "to illustrate the relationship between instantons and the zero modes of the dirac operator we show in figures 2 and 3 , the topological charge density @xmath4 , on a configuration obtained after 150 sweeps of improved cooling .",
    "the timeslice shown happens to contain part of an instanton and anti - instanton , and we plot isosurfaces of positive and negative values of @xmath4 .",
    "_ on this cooled configuration _ , we identify the lowest eigenmode of the dirac operator ; an isosurface of the magnitude of the eigenvector is plotted along with @xmath4 , and is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we see that on this smooth configuration in which the uv fluctuations have been removed , @xmath5 follows @xmath4 exactly , showing that on continuum like configurations , the zero mode `` tracks '' the topology , as expected from continuum arguments .",
    "next , figure 3b compares the _ uncooled _ zero mode to the _ cooled _ topological charge ; we see surprisingly good correlation , even after many ( 150 ) cooling sweeps .",
    "cooling identifies the dominant instanton  anti - instanton ( i - a ) pairs and the ensemble correlation between the _ uncooled _ dirac mode and cooled topological charge density is about 70% , after 150 sweeps of improved cooling , on configurations containing one or more i - a pairs .",
    "this validates a posteriori the improved cooling process ; the topology seen by the dirac zero mode is largely the same as that seen by the cooled topological charge . in figure 3a",
    ", we show isosurfaces of @xmath6 , which takes value @xmath7 for a right- or left - handed eigenmode respectively .",
    "yellow and blue surfaces indicate right and left - handedness .",
    "we see what amounts to the chirality flip as quarks `` tunnel '' from an instanton to an anti - instanton .",
    "at @xmath8 , all configurations have q=0 , as @xmath9 sharply .",
    "it is very difficult to say that there are instantons and anti - instantons . after a minimal degree of smoothing ( @xmath220 cooling sweeps ) a fit to non - interacting ( anti)instantons or calorons",
    "does not converge . before that , the configurations are too rough to attempt any topological identification , and we can not really say for sure that there are instantons at all .    we can however try to characterize the fluctuations of @xmath4 . in instanton",
    "liquid models@xcite , instanton  anti - instanton dipoles are thought to orient in the timelike direction .",
    "inspired by this theoretical picture we examined our data in the following way@xcite .",
    "we slice the lattice up into smaller sublattices , taking slabs of a given thickness @xmath10 .",
    "while the slabs have a given thickness in direction @xmath11 , they span the lattice in the other three directions .",
    "@xmath11 is chosen either along the time axis or one of the spatial axes , so that our slabs span either space or time . within the slab",
    "we compute @xmath12 ^ 2 d^4x = q^2_{\\rm slab}$ ] , then average over all possible slabs of thickness @xmath10 which are of the same orientation w.r.t .",
    "space or time .",
    "if instantons and anti - instantons are randomly placed in an isotropic lattice , we expect that , up to a volume normalization factor , spatial and temporally oriented slabs of the same thickness @xmath10 should have the same value of @xmath13 .",
    "this is what we see on the lattices below @xmath3 .",
    "if dipole pairs have formed in the timelike direction , we would expect @xmath13 to plateau for large @xmath10 for slabs which span the time - like direction ( @xmath11 in the spatial direction ) .",
    "this is because we are always adding a @xmath14 pair to the slab as we increase its thickness , and this does not increase @xmath15 in the slab . for spatially spanning slabs on the other hand ,",
    "the addition of charge is more or less random .    what we see above @xmath3 , after a small amount of cooling ( less than 20 sweeps ) , is the behavior just described : a plateau in @xmath13 for @xmath10=spacelike oriented slabs ( time - spanning ) , and no such plateau in the corresponding @xmath10=timelike ( space - spanning ) slabs .",
    "although it is quickly washed out by cooling , the asymmetry is quite clear and unmistakable .",
    "what is less clear is its interpretation .",
    "@xmath1 with _ randomly oriented dipoles _ having point charges , we see a trivial asymmetry of geometric origin .",
    "there is a plateau in both space and time slices , and the ratio of the plateau values is equal to the ratio of the slab sections ( i.e. 2 ) .",
    "@xmath1 for randomly placed _",
    "calorons _ , we see a * reverse * asymmetry which shows dependence on the radius of the caloron . by reverse asymmetry ,",
    "we mean that it is the space - spanning ( @xmath10 timelike ) slabs which plateau at a lower value , the reverse of what is seen in figure 1 . -1.9 cm        9 ph",
