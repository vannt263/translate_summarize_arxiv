    "contrast gratings ( hcg ) are diffractive structures made of a material with a high optical index for the grating slabs surrounded by a low index material . with a high optical index contrast ( @xmath1 ) and a near - wavelength grating period",
    ", the structure diffracts only into the 0@xmath2 order of diffraction and can be seen as a 1d photonic crystal supporting only a few propagative bloch modes . however , contrary to photonic crystal slabs , the modes propagate perpendicularly to the slab plane@xcite .",
    "the resonance of these modes between the two grating interfaces and their coupling at the interfaces can be adjusted to obtain different and very promising properties in a large range of applications@xcite such as broadband mirrors@xcite , high - q resonators@xcite , planar lenses@xcite , wavefront control @xcite , optical isolators@xcite , waveplates@xcite , circular polarizers@xcite or electromechanical mirrors@xcite .",
    "the mirror effect is particularly interesting since it can exhibit not only a polarization independence@xcite with good angular insensitivity@xcite but also a good reflectivity selectivity between te and tm modes@xcite . with only one high contrast grating layer ,",
    "it is thus possible to obtain a very large bandwidth of @xmath3 30% for more than 99% reflectivity and even @xmath3 17% for 99.9%@xcite .",
    "the development of vcsel devices emitting in the 23  m wavelength range remains a challenging task today .",
    "the realization of vcsel devices which are single - mode , low cost and tunable light sources @xcite is of great interest for gas detection in the mid - infrared wavelength range where gas species such as carbon monoxide exhibit strong absorption lines@xcite .",
    "vcsel structures based on inp system have demonstrated mid infrared laser emission in continuous wave ( cw ) at room temperature for @xmath4 2.3 m @xcite",
    ". however this wavelength seems to be the maximum limit for this material system @xcite .",
    "thus several vcsel structures based on algainassb material system have been developed .",
    "a vcsel structure using a buried tunnel junction for current confinement have shown cw emission at @xmath4  2.36  m up to 363  k@xcite while another structure based on selective lateral etching of the tunnel junction in order to realize a current aperture have shown cw emission at @xmath5  2.31  m up to 343  k@xcite .",
    "more recently , a gasb - based vcsel using a lateral wet oxidation of alas for current confinement has been demonstrated and exhibits cw laser emission at @xmath6  2.38  m for a temperature of 253  k@xcite .",
    "the development of vcsel based on algainassb is thus a very promising solution for the mid infrared wavelength range .",
    "however , laser emission is still limited today at @xmath4  2.6  m at room temperature @xcite .",
    "one of the main problem at such large wavelengths is the increase of the device thickness which reaches about 12 m since more than 20 pairs of quarter - wavelength alsb / gasb layers are required for the vcsel bragg mirrors@xcite .",
    "the large and high reflectivity bandwidth , low mirror thickness and high polarization selectivity of hcg structures make them good candidates for replacement of bragg mirrors in vcsel diodes .",
    "vcsel designs which use a grating as a polarizing mirror in order to enhance the laser properties have thus been proposed  @xcite .",
    "several vcsel structures based on hcg have then been developed and have demonstrated laser emission with gaas - based material around 850 nm@xcite and 980 nm@xcite or with inp - based material at 1320 nm@xcite and 1550 nm @xcite .",
    "the short amplification length of vcsel structures imposes the use of a high quality mirror with reflectivity larger than 99.5  % for large bandwidths which are typically about 150  nm in mid - infrared@xcite . the mirror efficiency required for vcsel application is thus demanding and imposes a precise adjustment of hcg geometrical parameters during the design process .",
    "even if the physic of hcg is well understood  @xcite , numerical simulations by rcwa  @xcite of the reflectivity of hcg structures allow the use of an optimization algorithm  @xcite to design the mirror properties for a specific application .",
    "since vcsel devices require high quality mirrors and hcg have sub - micrometric square - shaped patterns , the fabrication of hcg structures needs to control masking and etching process with a high accuracy in the nanometric range@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "hcg mirrors can be designed to have a good robustness of several percent on the geometrical dimensions .",
    "so , to achieve a robust and efficient mirror , the tolerance with respect to the errors of fabrication has to be taken into account during the design of the structure@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the design of a gaas hcg combined with an alo@xmath0 sublayer as low index material to replace the top dbr of mid infrared gasb - based vcsel . in a first part",
    ", an optimization algorithm is used to find the best dimensions of the hcg structure .",
    "then , the tolerance of the geometrical parameters of the optimum design with respect to the errors of fabrication are numerically investigated . in a second part",
    ", an anti - optimization algorithm is combined to the optimization process to develop a robust optimization algorithm .",
    "this original design approach of high contrast gratings takes into account the tolerances required by the manufacturers on the different parameters directly during the design process .",
    "the gratings mirrors are thus optimized to exhibit not only high efficiency but also large tolerance values .",
    "the grating period @xmath7 , fill factor @xmath8 , grating thickness @xmath9 , gaas layer thickness @xmath10 and alo@xmath0 layer thickness @xmath11 are optimized by an optimization algorithm to exhibit reflectivities higher than 99.5  % for a vcsel application at 2.3 m.,width=192 ]    the mirror structure presented in figure [ scheme ] is made of a gaas grating ( @xmath12 ) with a period @xmath7 , a thickness @xmath9 and a fill factor @xmath8 .",
    "the high contrast of optical index required for large bandwidth mirror is obtained thanks to the use of a low index alo@xmath0 sublayer ( @xmath13 ) with a thickness @xmath11 .",
    "the choice of the gaas / alo@xmath0 material system has been made in order to allow a monolithic epitaxial process during the integration of the hcg mirror in a vcsel structure@xcite .",
    "the alo@xmath0 layer can be obtained from a wet oxidation process of alas similar to the one used for current confinement by oxide aperture in vcsel structures@xcite .",
    "the gaas top layer is not completely etched during the grating fabrication resulting in a gaas intermediate layer of thickness @xmath10 .",
    "the presence of an intermediate gaas layer should enhance the mechanical stability of the grating above the alo@xmath0 layer since the oxidation process decreases the alas layer thickness of about 10  % @xcite .",
    "hcg mirrors presented in this work are designed to be used as vcsel top mirrors , thus in the hcg structure presented in figure  [ scheme ] , the gaas substrate corresponds to the vcsel cavity with light propagating from substrate to the air . in order to obtain a laser cavity ,",
    "a minimum reflectivity value of 99.5  % is required for vcsel mirrors for the largest possible bandwidth . to solve the problem of polarization instability and mode hoping of vcsel devices , the mirror is chosen to be polarization dependent by reflecting light only for the transverse magnetic mode ( tm ) while keeping the transverse electric ( te ) reflection coefficient @xmath14 below a 90  % threshold .      in order to satisfy all the previously defined vcsel requirements",
    ", the structure dimensions @xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath15 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 have to be carefully designed .",
    "an optimization algorithm has been used to automate the search of the most efficient mirror design .",
    "the efficiency of the hcg structure has been defined through the use of a figure of merit @xmath16@xcite which represents quantitatively the mirror quality from a vcsel application point of view :    @xmath17    the figure of merit @xmath16 mainly represents the normalized bandwidth of the mirror , defined as the wavelength range @xmath18 around @xmath19 where the reflectivity is larger than 99.5  % for tm mode and below 90  % for the te mode .",
    "the normalized bandwidth is also multiplied by a gaussian weighted average of the transverse magnetic reflection coefficients @xmath20 of the bandwidth to ensure a centering around @xmath19 .",
    "reflection spectra of the mirror are computed by rigorous coupled wave analysis ( rcwa)@xcite for transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations .",
    "several optimization algorithms can be used to design hcg structures such as simulated annealing@xcite , genetic algorithm@xcite or particle swarm@xcite . due to the presence of many local maxima , a global optimization approach",
    "is required . in this work ,",
    "we have implemented a particle swarm optimization ( pso ) algorithm@xcite to maximize the figure of merit @xmath16 .",
    "the particle swarm algorithm is based on a population of particles which are candidate solutions sharing their knowledge of optimum positions when exploring the search space .",
    "the particles of the swarm , of which positions correspond to a set of the design parameters @xmath21 , @xmath9 , @xmath15 , @xmath11 , @xmath22 , are moved at each algorithm iteration with a velocity @xmath23 :    @xmath24    the velocity @xmath23 at the iteration @xmath25 of the particle @xmath26 of the swarm is composed of 3 terms .",
    "firstly , the inertia of the particle is taken into account by keeping the velocity of the previous iteration @xmath27 .",
    "secondly , a local velocity term moves the particle toward the local best position @xmath28 known by the particle @xmath26 .",
    "finally , the swarm concept is created by sharing the best position of all particles thanks to the global best position @xmath29 which creates a global velocity term .",
    "the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two weights for the local and global velocities which are randomly chosen from a uniform law in the range @xmath32 $ ] at each particle move@xcite .",
    "the dimensions of the mirror structure have been optimized within bounds that take technological constraints into account .",
    "the alo@xmath0 layer thickness @xmath11 has been shown to maximize the reflectivity for values of @xmath33@xcite , but has been bounded between 300  nm and 400  nm to limit the optical losses within the oxide .",
    "the fill factor limitations are chosen with respect to the e - beam lithography and etching process and have been bounded between 35  % and 55  % .",
    "the other parameter constraints are only given to define a search space for the optimization algorithm but can also be chosen with respect to other technological limitations : 500  nm @xmath34 1100  nm , 900  nm @xmath35 1300  nm and 50  nm @xmath36 1000  nm .      .optimum",

    "a robust optimization algorithm has been developed to design high contrast grating mirrors for a vcsel application at 2.3  m. an anti - optimization process based on particle swarm optimization is used to adjust the geometrical parameters of the hcg structure by taking into account technological constraints .",
    "the fabrication accuracy of our equipments is also taken into account within the optimization process by defining tolerance requirements that the hcg parameters have to meet .",
    "the execution of the robust optimization algorithm thus results not only in an efficient mirror with a 99.5  % high reflectivity for a 425  nm large bandwidth but also in a robust design with more than @xmath3710  % of tolerance on the grating thickness , which is one of the most critical parameter of the grating fabrication process .",
    "the mirror also exhibits a strong polarization selectivity by keeping the reflection coefficient of the te mode lower than 70  % .",
    "this polarization selectivity combined with high mirror efficiency and large fabrication tolerance should make the gaas / alo@xmath0 hcg design presented in this work a very good vcsel mirror to allow emission above 2.3  m.",
