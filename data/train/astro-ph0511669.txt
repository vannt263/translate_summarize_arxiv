    "it has been widely accepted that gamma - ray burst ( grb ) emission is produced in a shocked optically thin plasma via the synchrotron process ( synchrotron shock model ; ssm ) .",
    "the resultant emission spectra is a convolution of synchrotron emission from electrons with distributed energies , and can be described as a broken power - law function with a broad @xmath1 peak . while the overall spectral shape , particularly at energies around the peak of the spectral energy density and above , depends critically on the energy spectrum of the source electrons , the shape of the low - energy spectrum",
    "is bound to converge to a power - law function , @xmath2 , with index @xmath3 , regardless of the source electron spectrum .",
    "this is because each of the individual source electron produces emission with the same low - energy asymptotic spectral form , namely a power - law function with an index of @xmath3 .",
    "most of the observed spectra of grbs are known to be well described by the `` band function '' ( band et al . 1993 ) , which is essentially an empirical functional form consisting of two smoothly connected power - law continua , where the spectral index is more negative at higher energies ( preece et al .",
    "the band function has three parameters to characterize the spectral shape : the low - energy photon spectral index , @xmath4 , the high - energy photon spectral index , @xmath5 , and the break energy , @xmath6 . here",
    ", we use the convention that indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 are positive in the power - law function , @xmath7 , following preece et al .",
    "if a photon spectrum produced by the optically thin synchrotron shock is fitted to the band function , the low - energy photon spectral index , @xmath4 , can not be larger than @xmath8 , because at any part of the ssm spectrum the photon slope is more negative than @xmath8 ( e.g. , tavani 1996 ) .",
    "preece et al .",
    "( 1998 ) examined the time - resolved energy spectra of over 100 bright grbs observed by the batse experiment on cgro , and found 23 bursts in which the spectral index limit of the ssm was violated . since the spectral measurement of grbs at energies below 30 kev was difficult for batse , preece et al .",

    "we present the spectral observation of grb 020813 with the hete-2 satellite .",
    "the fregate and wxm detectors on hete-2 cover a wide energy range of 2400 kev , and are well suited to study the spectral shape in the x - ray regions .",

    "we found that part of its time - resolved spectra exhibits a flat low - energy slope that violates the `` death line '' of the ssm . with its long duration , high fluences and characteristic spectra ,",
    "grb 020813 presents an ideal case to study the low - energy part of a hard grb . because of its unusual hardness ( see figure 4 ) , it is also interesting to study the spectral shape at high energies .",
    "that aspect will be presented in a separate paper using the data from another spacecraft , which covers energy ranges higher than those available with hete-2 . in section 2 ,",
    "the properties of grb 020813 observed by hete-2 are presented , including a detailed analysis of the time - resolved spectra . in section 3 , we discuss the possible process that causes the violation of the ssm limit on the low - energy power - law index . in particular , synchrotron self - absorption and compton - scattering processes are critically examined .",
    "the trigger for this event came from the fregate instrument , at 02:44:19.17 utc ( 9859.17 s ut ) on 2000 august 13 .",
    "the trigger occurred in the 30@xmath0400 kev band , on the 1.3 s time scale .",
    "the wxm flight software localized the burst , and its position was ra = @xmath10 , dec = @xmath11 ( j2000.0 ) , with a 90@xmath12 error radius of 14@xmath13 which includes statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the flight location was reported in a grb coordinate network ( gcn ) position notice at 10:50:48 ut , 4 minutes 14 s after the burst .",
    "ground analysis of the wxm data for the burst produced a refined location , which was reported in a gcn position notice 117 min after the burst .",

    "the sxc location can be expressed as a 90@xmath12 confidence circle that is 60@xmath16 in radius and is centered at ra = @xmath17 , dec = @xmath18 .",
    "grb 020813 was also observed by interplanetary network ( ulysses , konus - wind , and mars odyssey ) and the resulting ipn localization was fully consistent with the wxm error circle ( hurley et al .",

    "the burst data are only available when fregate triggered on the grb , whereas continuous , monitoring data are always recorded whenever hete-2 is operating . in a spectral analysis of fregate data , we usually use burst data , since it provides time- and energy - tagged photons with a much finer time resolution ( 6.4 @xmath44s ) than the continuous data , which is accumulated every 5 s. however , due to the long duration of grb 020813 , the memory was full and burst data were only available at 0@xmath4570 s. therefore , we constructed the energy spectrum for the remaining part of the grb by using continuous data over the full energy range of fregate ( 7@xmath0400 kev ) , which was also discrete data and only available during three separate intervals : @xmath46 s , 40@xmath45120 s , and 220@xmath45300 s ( figure 3 , left ) .",

    "@xmath52 background of the @xmath43 data with a linear function.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    to analyze the wxm data , we used the `` tag data '' generated at the burst trigger time in the full 2@xmath025 kev energy range .",
    "the background was integrated over 110 s , which was extracted from 118 s to 8 s before a burst . in the wxm spectral analysis",
    ", we considered only those events that registered on wires in the x- and the y - detectors illuminated by the burst .",
    "furthermore , since the variation in the gain is not uniform at the ends of the wires in the wxm detectors ( shirasaki et al .",
    "2003 ) , we used only the photon counts that registered in the central @xmath53 mm region of the wires to construct reliable spectra of the burst .",
    "as one can see in figure 2 , the light curve of grb 020813 shows a very complex structure , such that four distinct peaks , at least , are visible in the light curve . considering the fast time variability , we analyzed the spectrum of grb 020813 every 5 s , which is also the limit imposed by the time resolution of the fregate continuous data .    before",
    "going into the detailed spectral analysis , we first review the spectral evolution during a burst , by comparing the photon counting rates in the low energy ( wxm ) band with those in the high energy ( fregate ) bands .",
    "the hardness ratio of the fluxes , @xmath54(30@xmath0400 kev ) to @xmath55(2@xmath030 kev ) , is shown in figure 4 ( third panel ) .",
    "one can see that grb 020813 possibly consists of two distinct bursts that may have different physical origins .",
    "the border between the first and second bursts is approximately given by @xmath56 s. note that this corresponds to the epoch when the first gradual burst decayed to the initial ( background ) level , and succeeding flares started to appear in the light curve ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we therefore denote the former part as `` p1 '' and the latter part of the flare as `` p2 '' , just for convenience .",
    "the time intervals for p1 and p2 correspond to 17@xmath052 s and 67@xmath0109 s from the burst trigger time , respectively .",
    "note that the peak of p1 shows larger values of @xmath54(30@xmath0400 kev)/ @xmath55(2@xmath030 kev ) than that of p2 , meaning that energy spectra in the peak of p1 are harder than those of p2 .    in a more detailed analysis",
    ", we considered three different models to reproduce the observed spectra : ( 1 ) a power - law function , ( 2 ) a cutoff power - law function and ( 3 ) a band function ( band et al .",
    "we first fitted the data with a single power - law function , but this model did not represent the spectra well , except in low photon statistics regions .",
    "this is because the spectrum of grb 020813 is not a simple power - law , but bends sharply at high energies , as is often reported in other grbs ( e.g. , band et al .",
    "1993 ) . on the other hand , both the cutoff power - law and the band function provide improved fits for all regions . due to the limited photon statistics , it is hard to say which model is a better representation of the grb 020813 spectra for each 5 s segment .",
    "we thus fit the time - averaged spectrum with a cutoff power - law and the band function , and compared their results .",
    "when the photon statistics are sufficiently high , the band function gives a better fit with a reduced @xmath57 of 1.18 for 140 dof , compared to 1.33 for 141 dof for the cutoff power - law model . in the following analysis",
    ", we therefore use the band function to discuss the evolution of the spectra for all time intervals .",
    "table 2 presents the results of a time - resolved spectral analysis of grb 020813 .",
    "we used the xspec version 11.2.0 software package to do the spectral fits .",
    "the photoelectric absorption in the direction of grb 020813 is 7.0 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60",
    "( vanderspek et al . 2002 ) , which is negligible even in the wxm energy range above 2 kev .",
    "therefore , we do not consider @xmath61 as a parameter in the spectral analysis .",
    "figure 4 summarizes the time evolution of spectral parameters together with the wxm and the fregate light curves measured at 2@xmath025 kev and 7@xmath0400 kev , respectively ( the first and the second panels ) .",
    "the time variations of the low and high - energy photon indices , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are plotted in the fourth and fifth panels .",
    "the break energy in the spectrum @xmath62 is given in the sixth panel , and the fluxes measured in the 2@xmath0400 , 2@xmath025 and 30@xmath0400 kev energy bands are plotted in the remaining panels .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , grb 020813 spectra have a clear break around 100 kev , meaning that most of the power is emitted in the hard x - ray and the soft gamma - ray energy bands . for the time - averaged spectrum of p1",
    ", we found that @xmath63 ergs @xmath60 and @xmath64 ergs @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the logarithmic fluence ratio , defined as log@xmath65 , is @xmath00.96 .",
    "similarly , we obtain log@xmath66 for p2 , with @xmath67 ergs @xmath60 and @xmath68 ergs @xmath60 .",
    "these results confirm that grb 020813 belongs to the class of long classical grbs according to the hete classification method ( sakamoto et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , we note that log@xmath69 is quite large compared to other grb populations ( sakamoto et al . 2005 ) and would be at the extreme end of the classical grb population .",
    "this is also indicated by the unusually @xmath70 of low - energy ( below @xmath62 ) photons observed in p1 .",
    "in fact , the low - energy power - law indices , @xmath4 , range from @xmath71 to 0.0 , some of which are much larger than expected from the `` death line '' ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we will thus consider the origin of this low - energy depletion in the next section .",

    "the crossing point of the three expressions indicates the allowed parameters for the ssc model.,width=302 ]    thus , it is difficult to explain the p1 spectrum of grb 020813 by either the ssa or ssc model .",
    "therefore , we consider other radiation processes , such as `` jitter '' radiation and compton drag effects .",
    "medvedev ( 2000 ) pointed out that the radiation emitted by ultra - relativistic electrons in highly nonuniform , small - scale magnetic fields is different from synchrotron radiation if the electron s transverse deflections in these fields are much smaller than the beaming angle .",
    "he showed that the spectral power distribution of the radiation produced by the power - law distributed electrons is well described by a sharply broken power - law , @xmath173 for @xmath174 and @xmath175 for @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the electron power - law index and @xmath178 is the jitter break frequency ( medvedev 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , the low - energy depletion ( @xmath4 is larger than the death - line ) with a spectral break may be naturally explained by jitter radiation . in this model ,",
    "the spectral break due to jitter will be observed at    @xmath179    where @xmath180 is the relative lorentz factor of two colliding shells , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 is the initial effective thermal lorentz factor , @xmath183 ( medvedev 2000 ) . if @xmath116 is close to 1000 , @xmath112 can be observed in the x - ray band . in the realistic case ,",
    "the emergent spectrum is determined by the statistical properties of the magnetic field in the emission region .",
    "if the magnetic field is highly inhomogeneous , jitter radiation may overcome the synchrotron radiation , whereas the reverse applies for the uniform magnetic field cases .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the x - ray spectrum of grb 020813 ( p1 region ) may be a mixture of jitter radiation with the usual synchrotron radiation component , but detailed modeling of the spectrum is beyond the scope of this paper .    as an alternative idea , lazzati et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) proposed that the gamma - ray photons that characterize the prompt emission of grbs are produced through the compton drag process , caused by the interaction of a relativistic fireball with a very dense soft photon bath .",
    "this is an interesting assumption , because some of the grbs are indeed associated with supernovae , where the expanding star can provide enough soft photons to make the radiative drag effective .",
    "this model accounts for the basic properties of grbs , i.e. , the overall energetics and the peak frequency of the spectrum , with a radiative efficiency of more than 50@xmath12 .",
    "also note that the grb should have a very hard spectrum @xmath184 , as expected from the rayleigh - jeans law below the peak frequency of the emission .",
    "in fact , our spectral shape is in good agreement with the spectra produced by compton drag for @xmath185 ( ghisellini et al .",
    "the major weakness of this model is that the predicted spectrum is basically thermal , and a typical power - law spectrum is not always produced .",
    "thus , we find that both the jitter radiation and the compton drag may reproduce the low - energy depletion observed in grb 020813 .    however , we note that a complete theoretical interpretation of the data is beyond the scope of this paper",
    ". there are other theoretical models that can explain the spectra with low - energy depletion .",
    "the average p2 spectrum is well described by the band function with @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "in contrast to p1 , @xmath4 falls in the range allowed by the standard synchrotron shock model ( ssm ) .",
    "as shown by sakamoto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , integration of the batse and the hete-2 data revealed that the `` typical '' grb spectrum is well represented by a broken power - law ( band ) function with @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , the observed break energy corresponds to the peak energy ( @xmath190 ) in @xmath191 space , which is where most of the grb power is emitted . for the case of p2 in grb 020813 , however , the spectrum is still @xmath192 up to @xmath193 400 kev . in the standard picture of ssm",
    ", such a break could be explained only when @xmath112 is well above the hete bandpass , which again seems to be quite different from the p1 spectrum .",
    "we stress , however , that it does not seem to be strange even if p1 and p2 show quite different spectral features , since they constitute distinct `` peaks '' both in the light curve and in the hardness ratio ( figure 4 ) .",
    "according to the internal shock scenario ( e.g. , piran 1999 ) , grb light curves are thought to be produced by the collisions of shells that are moving with different lorentz factors .",
    "a fraction of the bulk kinetic energy is converted to the random energy of electrons , which emit the @xmath194 radiation as prompt grb emission . since the radiation from each two - shell collision",
    "would be observed as a single pulse , p1 and p2 may be attributed to the collisions of different pairs of shells , which are possibly taking place in different physical conditions ( e.g. , magnetic field , density of material ) .",
    "a detailed simulation of a collisionless shock plasma predicts that the magnetic field produced in grb shocks randomly fluctuates on a very small scale of the relativistic skin depth , which is @xmath195 cm in internal shocks ( medvedev , loeb 1999 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the emitting ultrarelativisitic electrons have much larger larmor radii . in such situations ,",
    "jitter radiation may overcome the usual synchrotron radiation , but it is also likely that the large scale fields are also present in the grb ejecta .",
    "therefore , the dominance of the `` synchrotron '' and the `` jitter '' radiation would be determined by a combination of large - scale fields ( @xmath196 ) and non - uniform , small - scale magnetic fields ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "we mention in this context that the different observed properties in p1 and p2 may reflect the different balance of large / small - scale magnetic fields , where @xmath198 for p1 and @xmath198 for p1 and @xmath199 for p2 , but further study using more data is necessary to confirm this .",
    "in this paper we reported hete-2 wxm / fregate observations of bright and long grb 020813 .",
    "our observational results demonstrate that the peak p1 ( 17@xmath052 s ) of the burst shows a depletion of low - energy photons below about 50 kev .",
    "therefore , we examined various scenarios to understand the origin of such a low - energy depletion . we conclude that it is difficult to explain the depletion by either the ssa or ssc model .",
    "one possibility is that the low - energy depletion may be understood as a mixture of `` jitter '' radiation with the usual synchrotron radiation component . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum of p2 ( 67@xmath0109 s ) can be explained by the standard ssm .",
    "we believe that the magnetic field is uniform and that synchrotron radiation may overcome the jitter radiation in this region .",
