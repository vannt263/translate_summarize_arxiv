    "some years later , this subject was re - investigated in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "several aspects of oscillatons were studied , like their structure , dynamics , stability and more . in particular it was found that oscillatons reached a maximum mass around an oscillation frequency of @xmath2 .",
    "it is expected that solutions would become unstable below this frequency , therefore the frequency range of oscillatons is expected to be @xmath3 .",
    "the possible existence of a secular change of the frequency of oscillatons induced by ( scalar ) radiation has not been discussed , however , in those papers , as a matter of fact it has been simply assumed that the solutions are truly periodic .",
    "the physically motivated , important question concerning the possible radiation loss of oscillatons , has been first considered by don n.  page @xcite , who has pointed out that due to scalar radiation oscillatons are bound to lose mass .",
    "page has estimated the amplitude of the outgoing scalar wave and derived a formula for their mass - loss , which turns out to be rather small even on cosmological time - scales .",
    "the subject of longevity of oscillatons has been taken up again in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "this study has also been performed in the limit where the amplitude of the scalar field is small , when a perturbative analytic approach is feasible , and the structure of oscillatons was investigated in detail . in the limit of small amplitudes ,",

    "the situation of the scalar field is more complicated and one has to study in some detail the wave - equation ( [ e : divt ] ) . if one keeps only the dominating terms ( i.e. if one sets @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , eq .",
    "( [ e : divt ] ) reduces to : @xmath28 @xmath7 being a sum of odd cosines , the equation for the harmonic @xmath29 is : ( r_n)_,rr + (n^2 ^ 2 - 1 ) r _ n = 0  .",
    "given that @xmath30 , one has two different cases :    * for @xmath31 , the solution that vanishes at infinity is [ e : shphi1 ] _",
