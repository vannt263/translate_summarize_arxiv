    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) predicts five physical states in the higgs sector : three neutral scalars @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and a charge conjugated pair @xmath0  @xcite . at the tree - level",
    "just two free parameters are enough to fix masses of all these states  @xcite .",
    "the conventional choice is to use the mass of cp - odd neutral higgs , @xmath7 , and the ratio of the vacuum expectations values of higgs doublets , @xmath8 . for the values of @xmath8 considered here ,",
    "the mass of @xmath0 does not differ considerably from that of @xmath6 .",
    "only few decay channels seem to be useful for the search of the charged higgs boson at lhc .",
    "the most promising one is the @xmath9 decay mode , in particular in the @xmath10 associated production with a top quark decaying to a fully hadronic final state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 decay channel has also been proposed as a possible discovery channel for charged higgs at lhc in phenomenological studies @xcite .",
    "a further motivation for using the channel @xmath1 in the search of the charged higgs boson is shown in figures  [ fig : beta30br],[fig : beta5br],[fig : beta30mubr ] and  [ fig : beta30atbr ] .",
    "the @xmath11 decay becomes abruptly the dominant mode when the mass of the @xmath0 exceeds the sum of masses of top and bottom quarks , and is still not so heavy that the supersymmetric decay channels become significant .",
    "it represents more than @xmath12 to the branching ratio for @xmath13 gev @xmath14 gev , independently of the value of @xmath15 as shown in figures  [ fig : beta30br ] and  [ fig : beta5br ] . in the present study",
    "the susy parameters are taken to be @xmath16 = 0 ( no - mixing ) , @xmath17 = 200 gev , @xmath18 = -200 gev and @xmath19 = 800 gev , @xmath20 = 1 tev  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath1 decay mode is not sensitive to the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters , at least to the sign of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath18 neither to stop mixing seem as is visible from figures  [ fig : beta30mubr ] and  [ fig : beta30atbr ] .",
    "the charged higgs boson in association of a top quark is produced through the reactions @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the cross section for the production with 3 tagged b - jets is the sum of the cross sections for these two processes subsracting the common terms to avoid double counting @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath0 is required to decay to top and bottom quarks .",
    "the top quarks decay further to a bottom quark and a @xmath23 boson . in order to trigger the event one of @xmath23 s has to decay to a lepton and its antineutrino whilst the other one is assumed to decay hadronically to light quarks .",
    "the main backgrounds are from @xmath24 jets with two real b - jets and a mistagged non - b - jet , and the irreducible background due to @xmath25 . potentially , there are also backgrounds from other processes , but these are much smaller .",
    "for example the process @xmath26 may cause some background events , but is unlikely to generate five jets which would fulfil the selection criteria .",
    "these other backgrounds are assumed to be negligible and are not included in this study .",
    "we assume an integrated luminosity of 30 fb@xmath27 and superimpose a pile - up of 3 minimum bias events on the physics events . for the signal this leads to the production ( including branching ratios , without any selection cuts ) of approximately 43  000 events for @xmath28 gev and @xmath29 , but only slightly over 11  000 events for @xmath30 gev and @xmath29 .",
    "the expected number of background events with this luminosity is about  @xmath31 .",
    "the event generation is carried out with spythia  @xcite for both signal events using the process @xmath21 ( pythia subprocess 161 ) and the @xmath32 background ( processes 81 and 82 ) where additional jets come from parton showering .",
    "detector performance is simulated using cmsjet  @xcite with parametrized track reconstruction performance based on geant simulations  @xcite for b - tagging .    as a first selection criterion for an event ,",
    "we require an isolated lepton with transverse momentum @xmath33 gev and at least five jets with @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore three of those jets have to be identified as b - jets ( b - tagging is discussed in more detail in the following ) .",
    "if these conditions are not fulfilled , the event is rejected .",
    "then the event reconstruction is performed as follows . a combination of two non - b - jets with the mass closest to the nominal @xmath23 mass is chosen to be assigned to the hadronically decayed @xmath23 boson .",
    "if the reconstructed mass differs more than @xmath36 gev form the nominal value , the event is rejected .",
    "then a b - jets is chosen to reconstruct the mass of the top quark together with the hadronically decayed @xmath23 , selecting the combination with the invariant mass closest to the nominal top mass .",
    "the reconstructed hadronic top mass distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : amtop_rec ] .",
    "the other top is reconstructed from the leptonically decayed @xmath23 and a b - jet .",
    "the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum is fixed using @xmath23 mass constraint .",
    "that procedure leads to two possible solutions , the smaller of which is taken .",
    "the missing transverse momentum is assumed to be due to the neutrino .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath23 is paired with another potential b - jet chosen to give the mass closest to the nominal top mass to reconstruct the leptonic top . the mass distribution for the leptonic top is shown in figure  [ fig : am_top2 ] .",
    "if the mass of either of the reconstructed top quarks deviates more than @xmath37 gev from @xmath38 gev , the event is rejected .",
    "finally the most probable b - jet among the remaining b - jet candidates is chosen to be paired with either the hadronic or leptonic top to reconstruct the @xmath0 .",
    "the hadronically and leptonically reconstructed higgs mass distributions are shown in figures  [ fig : hplus1 ] and  [ fig : hplus2 ] , respectively .",
    "as it is not possible to know which of the two top quarks originates from the higgs decay this procedure leads to a large combinatorial background from signal events .",
    "the following results shown are for @xmath39 gev and @xmath40 with b - likeness @xmath41 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the background events are found to be kinematically very similar to the signal events .",
    "one might expect that extra jets accompanying @xmath32 would be considerably softer compared to signal events , and hard kinematical cuts on transverse momenta of jets would improve considerably the background rejection .",
    "we argue that this is not the case , as the events fulfilling the selection criteria for at least five jets are in the rather energetic tail .",
    "they seem to be even harder on the average when compared to signal events in case of the relatively light higgs ( @xmath42 gev ) . for heavier higgs ( @xmath43 gev ) the jets from signal events are more energetic than those coming from the background , but not significantly .",
    "since the total number of events in this case is rather small ( the cross - section diminishes with increasing @xmath7 ) , kinematical cuts , which inevitable reduce the signal as well , do not lead to any higher value of the formal significance .",
    "for these reasons we do not introduce any kinematical cuts in addition to those mentioned earlier and coming from the basic detector performance . in conclusion ,",
    "the severe complication in background rejection is due to the fact that the background very much mimics the shape of the signal .",
    "a possible improvement in the background rejection could be expected from from the application of neural network methods , but this approach is not justified at this stage .",
    "the kinematical difference between the signal and the background being marginal , the fact that signal events contain one b - jet more than the background is of crucial importance . actually , there is also an associated fourth b - jet in the signal event from the @xmath10 final state and a requirement for four tagged b - jets would reduce the number of background events drastically .",
    "unfortunately , this fourth b - jet is on the average rather soft and its detection is very problematic and can not therefore be used for background reduction . on the other hand",
    ", there is an irreducible @xmath25 background , so that even conceptually signal and background events may be indistinguishable by the number of b - jets ( see also figure  [ fig : atlas ] ) .",
    "thus even perfect b - tagging may be insufficient to ensure observation if the number of signal events is too low .",
    "the b - tagging procedure that we have used in this study has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "at least two tracks in a jet cone ( @xmath44 ) are required , each having transverse momentum @xmath45 gev . for these tracks",
    "we define the impact parameter significance @xmath46 as the ratio of the reconstructed transverse impact parameter to its error .",
    "the b - likeness of a jet is the significance @xmath46 of the second best track . practically , b - jets tend to have b - likeness bigger than 2 while other jets seldom have b - likeness that exceeds 2 .",
    "the optimal choice for a cut in b - likeness is found to be 3 and all the following results are obtained using this cut , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the distribution of the invariant higgs boson mass from hadronically and leptonically reconstructed signal events are shown separately superimposed on the corresponding backgrounds in figures  [ fig : sign_hadr ] and  [ fig : sign_lep ] .",
    "the total signal containing both hadronically and leptonically reconstructed top quarks together with the background is shown in figure  [ fig : sign_had_lep ] .",
    "figures  [ fig : ma250 ] and  [ fig : ma400 ] show the signal superimposed on the background for @xmath28  gev and @xmath30  gev with @xmath40 .",
    "the number of events decreases with increasing @xmath7 making the signal visibility difficult for @xmath30  gev .",
    "the effect of the b - likeness cut is shown for @xmath28  gev and @xmath47 in figures  [ fig : b3ma250tanb40 ] ,  [ fig : b4ma250tanb40 ] and  [ fig : b5ma250tanb40 ] .",
    "a harder cut reduces considerably the number of background events leading to a visible signal peak for b - likeness @xmath48 as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : b5ma250tanb40 ] .",
    "the signal to background ratio is significantly improved , but the significance @xmath49 is lower due to reduced signal statistics . the @xmath50-significance contour curve shown in figure  [ fig:5sigma_100fb ] is obtained using the cut b - likeness @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath50-discovery regions for the channels @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xcite , @xmath53 @xcite and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath52 @xcite are also shown in the figure .",
    "the @xmath51 , @xmath52 channel seems to be more profitable for the detection than the one studied in this work for any possible value of @xmath7 although the difference around @xmath28 gev is not very large .",
    "the @xmath55 , @xmath52 channel where the light @xmath0 is produced in top decays covers the low mass ( @xmath56 140 gev ) part of the ( @xmath57 ) -parameter space almost independent on @xmath58 .",
    "we have tried to compare our results to the corresponding predictions of the atlas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the final results for the discovery reach are similar .",
    "@xmath50-contour curves share the same peculiar shape , having a minimum at @xmath59 gev when the mass of higgs is already significantly larger then that of top quark so that the jets coming from the decay process are energetic enough to be efficiently detected and the cross - section is still relatively large , guaranteeing plenty of events .",
    "however , the background invariant mass distribution in  @xcite is very different , with a monotonically decreasing behaviour , in contrast to our result with background peaking in the signal region .",
    "the monotonically decreasing background shape greatly favours the visibility of the signal peak and makes the determination of the background contribution under the signal peak easier .",
    "the kinematical cuts used in  @xcite are similar to ours , thus the only possible explanation may come from the b - tagging procedure .",
    "we tried to repeat the analysis using the idealised procedure for b - tagging .",
    "namely , we accept a b - jet with a fixed probability independent of its momentum and `` mistag '' a non - b - jet as a b - jet also with fixed probability .",
    "an example of the standard model ( sm ) background obtained this way is shown in figure  [ fig : atlas ] where , naturally after necessary kinematical cuts , all the b - jets are identified correctly ( b - tagging efficiency = 1 ) and no other jets are mistagged as a b - jet ( impurity = 0 ) . despite this",
    ", we were not able to reproduce the desirable monotonically decreasing background shape .",
    "in summary , we have studied the possibility to detect a massive charged higgs boson in the cms experiment at lhc when the @xmath0 decays to top and bottom quarks in the process @xmath2 .",
    "this channel is found to be a potential higgs discovery channel at lhc for a significant part of the mssm parameter space , although the large background from @xmath60 and @xmath61 events and from signal combinatorics makes the extraction of the signal difficult . because the decay @xmath1 does not lead to a well visible peak superimposed on the background ,",
    "a precise theoretical estimate of the number of the sm background events is needed for the observation .",
    "extraction of higgs signal in this channel requires excellent b - tagging ; both true b - jets have to be identified with high efficiency and the probability to mistag a non - b - jet must be very low ; the @xmath62 threshold for b - jets must be low ( @xmath63 20 gev ) to be able to improve the separation of the signal from the expected number of events .",
    "a significant improvement can be expected at high higgs masses ( @xmath64 400 gev ) from the optimization of the kinematical cuts to take into account the much harder spectrum of b - jets from @xmath0 decay in this domain .",
    "a further improvement could be expected eventually with the implementation of neural network techniques ."
