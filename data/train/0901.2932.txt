    "currently we have two extremely successful fundamental theories at hand in physics : general relativity , describing space , time and gravitation ; and quantum theory , describing electroweak and strong interactions by means of quantum field theories .",
    "the interface of both theories was not explored for a long time , because there have been no experiments that could probe regimes in which both quantum and gravitational effects become important .",
    "still , not only from a philosophical point of view , physicists aspire a unified theory of both , which is usually called quantum gravity ( qg ) . in standard relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) , space - time is considered a fixed arena in which physical processes take place .",
    "quite in contrast , qg theories require drastic modifications of space - time when structures approach the qg mass scale @xcite , often identified with the planck mass @xmath0 .",
    "however , the energies at which qg effects lead to deviations from conventional quantum mechanics might lie well below the qg energy scale . as a non - renormalizable interaction gravity may leave distinctive imprints also at energies much below the preferred qg scale , if violating any fundamental symmetry .",
    "thus , we might spot qg effects not only on extreme energy scales , but use gev / tev photons as `` low - energy '' probes .",
    "an energy dependence of the speed of light in vacuum may arise from photon propagation through a gravitational medium containing quantum fluctuations on distance scales on the order of the planck length @xmath1 and on timescales @xmath2 . while being smooth at large distances , space - time at short distances of the order of @xmath3 might show a complex , foamy , structure due to quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "such planck - size topological defects , viz .",
    "black holes with microscopic event horizons , appearing and evaporating spontaneously , might lead to quantum decoherence and lorentz invariance ( li ) violation .",
    "there are numerous formal mathematical approaches to qg . among the most popular ones are loop qg @xcite , which is the canonical non - perturbative quantization of general relativity , and superstring theory , which originally has been developed to describe the behavior of hadrons .",
    "( see @xcite for a review on qg theories ) . in liouville",
    "string theory @xcite , modified dispersion relations ( mdr ) are enabled by higher - order derivatives in effective maxwell and dirac equations .",
    "it has been pointed out by amelino - camelia et  al.@xcite that different approaches to qg lead to a similar description of first - order effects of such a time dispersion : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the time delay relative to the standard speed of light , @xmath6 is a model - dependent factor of the order 1 , @xmath7 is the energy of the observed radiation , and @xmath8 is the distance traversed by the radiation .",
    "thus , li violation ( liv ) is expected as a generic signature of approaches to qg .",
    "a rather general review on the status of liv tests is given by mattingly  @xcite .",
    "a number of predicted new phenomena lead to testable astrophysical effects .",
    "dispersion @xcite and vacuum birefringence @xcite ( leading to polarization - dependent liv ) are purely kinematical effects and require only an mdr and a standard definition of the group velocity .",
    "below , we will particularly elaborate on astrophysical time - of - flight tests of the dispersion relation of photons .",
    "other effects , like anomalous threshold reactions , threshold shifts in standard reactions , or reactions affected by `` speed limits '' ( e.g. synchrotron radiation ) , need additional assumptions on energy / momentum conservation and dynamics , or on effective qft , and will not be discussed here .",
    "note that a non - constant speed of light may also occur with maintained lorentz invariance , e.g. , in doubly - special relativity @xcite ; this underlines the necessity for astrophysical tests of liv ( liv tests on earth would yield negative results ! ) .    in the remaining sections , we will review astrophysical probes of qg with high energy @xmath9-rays",
    "when looking for qg phenomena , we expect deviations from qft , presumably suppressed by some power of the planck mass ( or the qg mass scale ) . from a purely phenomenological point of view @xcite",
    ", such effects can be treated using a perturbative expansion , assuming the involved energies @xmath10 : @xmath11 note that an explicit breaking of li is expected at the planck mass scale .",
    "a linearly - deformed dispersion relation arises , e.g. , in noncritical liouville string theory , while in critical string theory , only quadratic deviations are expected @xcite .",
    "an mdr implies an energy - dependent speed of light , @xmath12 or , in other words , the vacuum acquires non - trivial optical properties , namely a refractive index @xmath13 .",
    "this translates into a delay , including cosmological effects , @xmath14 to measure any such time delay , very fast transient astrophysical phenomena are required , which provide a time stamp for the simultaneous emission of photons of different energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : morselli ] ) . the corresponding figure of merit for qg tests is given by the sensitivity to a given qg mass scale , @xmath15 the photon energy @xmath7 acts as lever arm , implying that both an instrument for measuring @xmath9-ray energies as high as possible , but also astrophysical sources that deliver these energies are advantageous .",
    "but also the time resolution of the instrument and the fineness of the structures in the @xmath9-ray signal , described by @xmath5 , are decisive , and the source has to provide enough photon statistics per time as to allow for a binning as small as possible .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the luminosity distance of the source .",
    "in the x - ray to vhe @xmath9-ray domain , photon data are characterized by arrival directions , energies , and arrival times of x - rays , gamma rays , or gamma - ray candidates .",
    "a very basic method of assessing any time delay of very high energy photons , motivated also by the sparse statistics at these energies , relies on finding peaks in the cross - correlation function of light curves of different photon energy bandpasses @xcite .",
    "note , however , that such analyses do not take into account the full available information each individual photon carries @xcite .",
    "therefore , more appropriate methods have been developed , as summarized in the following .",
    "* in the energy - cost - function method @xcite , it is assumed that traveling through any dispersive medium will increase the spread of the photon arrival time distribution .- ray source can be modeled using the ecf approach . ]",
    "thus , by minimizing the spread of an observed , dispersive - broadened pulse by an `` energy cost function '' , the original pulse and the dispersion can be reconstructed @xcite . * a log - likelihood fit , describing the flare peak form @xmath16 ( which might be assumed , e.g. , as gaussian pulse ) , the instrumental energy smearing @xmath17 , the energy spectrum @xmath18 of the flare , and the observed photon arrival times @xmath19 can be applied to the unbinned data @xcite , e.g. , @xmath20 * cross - correlation of oversampled light curves @xcite . this `` modified cross - correlation function '' ( mccf ) method allows for resolving features ( as time delays ) in the light curves well below the duration of the flux bins .",
    "* a wavelet analysis suppresses noise in the data and identifies `` genuine variation points '' @xcite , which can be attributed to flares and can be used as time stamps in different energy bandpasses .",
    "this method is particularly useful if the observational data are noisy and the ( multiple or complex ) flare structure is not very significant .",
    "pulsars have very distinct periodic light - curve forms , and due to the periodicity , these light curves can be sampled very accurately . in observations of photons up to @xmath21 from the crab pulsar , at a distance of @xmath22  kpc @xcite , using the sub - millisecond timing of egret , @xmath23 was achieved . with these numbers ,",
    "a sensitivity to @xmath24 can be achieved . for active galactic nuclei ( agn ; typical distances : in excess of 100 mpc @xmath25 @xmath26 ) , imaging air cerenkov telescopes ( iact @xcite ) currently may observe bright @xmath9-ray flares with energies up to around @xmath27 with sufficient statistics and a time resolution ( given by the agn flare timescales ) of @xmath28 .",
    "this enables a sensitivity up to the planck energy scale , @xmath29 . in the absence of a linear term in the mdr",
    ", the quadratic reach would be around @xmath30 .",
    "gamma - ray bursts , at distances beyond 7000 mpc , will be routinely observed by _",
    "@xcite at energies up to @xmath31 , which will yield a sensitivity of @xmath29 .",
    "note , however , that current grb studies are restricted to @xmath32 , as until recently only @xmath33kev was available ( @xmath34 in the quadratic case ) .",
    "the crab pulsar has a pulsation period of 33.18 ms . as its pulsations",
    "are well aligned in time from radio through x - ray wavelengths , it seems likely that photons of different energies are produced nearly simultaneously . using the sub - ms timing of the egret experiment ,",
    "it could be shown @xcite that @xmath35 gev photons trail those at @xmath36 mev by no more than 0.35  ms ( 95% c.l . ) , implying @xmath37 . recently ,",
    "pulsed emission from the crab was also detected at energies up to 60 gev @xcite : about 8,500 @xmath9-ray events form a signal at the 6.4-@xmath38 significance level .",
    "this observation might yield a lower limit for quantum gravity effects of @xmath39 @xcite , exceeding the limit given by the egret - crab analysis .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; @xcite ) have rather complex individual time profiles .",
    "once a relativistic fireball is created in the gigantic explosions thought to be the origin of grbs , the physics ought to be insensitive to the nature of the progenitor object .",
    "grbs have been found at redshifts exceeding @xmath40 ( 7% of the presently known grbs ; the average redshift is @xmath41 ) .",
    "thus grbs seem to be a natural proxy to test qg predictions .",
    "the key issue is to distinguish possible qg signatures from intrinsic delays , particularly as delays in grbs have been observed .",
    "qg effects should increase predictably with the distance of the individual grb .",
    "the accessible energies , however , have been smaller than or at most some gev ; iact , which are sensitive in the above 30  gev region , are still awaiting the first grb detection @xcite .",
    "an additional complication arises from the fact that establishing the distance of grbs is not trivial and works only for a fraction of the observed grbs .",
    "the strongest qg constraint from an individual grb is that from grb 930229 @xcite , where during a rise time of @xmath42 the dispersion of photons was measured to be @xmath43ms at energies @xmath44 , yielding @xmath45 .",
    "the caveat of this observation is that grb 930229 has no measured redshift ( ! ) , thus with an assumed peak flux of @xmath46 photons s@xmath47 and the peak width ",
    "redshift relation @xcite a distance @xmath48mpc was inferred . for grb 051221a , which occurred in a galaxy at @xmath49 , no time delay of photons between 15 and 350 kev",
    "was observed @xcite , leading to a limit of @xmath50 .",
    "a more robust method is to study large samples of grb . in @xcite , a total of 36 grbs observed by batse ( 9 bursts ) , _ hete-2 _",
    "( 15 bursts ) , and _ swift _ ( 11 bursts ) up to @xmath51 was used .",
    "the energy difference of photons in that sample is around 200 kev , and to account for possible source effects , a `` universal source uncertainty '' of 54 ms was accounted for .",
    "a limit of @xmath52 was deduced .",

    "lat itself should detect around 15 bursts without gamma - ray burst monitor triggers .",
    "kuehn et  al .",
    "@xcite simulated the lat response to grb photons , focusing on the prompt grb emission . due to the wide field of view",
    ", lat in contrast to the tev instruments is quite unique in detecting prompt grb emission .",
    "for the simulations , spectral indices have been taken from batse and extrapolated to lat energies .",
    "even with a binned analysis , a simultaneous fit to multiple grbs ( at @xmath54 ) was shown to have a sensitivity at @xmath55  gev .",
    "an alternative method @xcite also has this sensitivity .",
    "recently , the lat collaboration reported the first detection of high - energy photons from three grbs @xcite , and used the strongest burst , grb 080916c , to derive a lower qg energy scale limit of @xmath56 .",
    "the study of high energy ( @xmath57 mev ) @xmath9-ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is one of the major goals of space - borne and ground - based @xmath9-ray astronomy .",
    "the vast majority of the currently known vhe @xmath9-ray emitting agns @xcite are blazars @xcite , rwagner / sources/ for an up - to - date source list . ] a subclass characterized by high variability over the whole electromagnetic spectrum , a characteristic peak in their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from nonthermal synchrotron emission , and a second peak at @xmath9-ray energies . in synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) models it is assumed that the observed @xmath9-ray peak is due to the inverse - compton ( ic ) emission from the accelerated electrons up - scattering previously produced synchrotron photons to high energies @xcite . in hadronic models , instead ,",
    "interactions of a highly relativistic jet outflow with ambient matter , proton - induced cascades , or synchrotron radiation off protons , are responsible for the high - energy photons .",
    "the duty cycle of _ fermi _ enables a quasi - continuous monitoring of blazar flaring activity ( also monitoring programs by iacts are in place , @xcite ) , while the high sensitivity of current iact is advantageous for understanding the particle acceleration mechanisms in flares , the origin of the high - energy @xmath9-rays , as well as the relations between photons of different energies ( from radio to vhe ; particularly between the two emission populations @xcite ) .      the first rapid flare from a tev blazar",
    "was observed by the whipple telescope from markarian ( mkn ) 421 ( @xmath58 ) on 1996 may 15 @xcite .",
    "the peak of the flare is concentrated in one 280  second bin , and as there were no @xmath35  tev @xmath9-rays observed outside this bin , it was concluded that the @xmath9-rays @xmath59  tev and @xmath35  tev are in step with @xmath6095% probability @xcite .",
    "this observation translates in a lower limit @xmath61 .",
    "magic @xcite recorded fluxes exceeding four times the crab - nebula flux from mkn 501 ( @xmath62 ) in 2005 , and revealed rapid flux changes with doubling times as short as 3 minutes or less @xcite . for the first time , short ( @xmath63  20 minute ) vhe @xmath9-ray flares with a resolved time structure could be used for detailed studies of particle acceleration and cooling timescales .",
    "the two flares behaved differently ( fig .",
    "[ fig : magic ] ) : while the 2005 june 30 flare is only visible in 250gev1.2tev , the 2005 july 9 flare is apparent in all energy bands ( 120  gev to beyond 1.2  tev )",
    ". additionally , at a zero - delay probability of @xmath64 , a marginal time delay @xmath65 with @xmath66 towards higher energies was found using two independent analyses , both exploiting the full statistical power of the dataset ( see @xcite for details ) . for a quadratic effect ( vanishing first - order term in eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] ) , @xmath67 with @xmath68 is obtained correspondingly .",
    "several explanations for this delay have been considered up to now :    1 .",
    "electrons inside the emission region moving with constant doppler factor are gradually accelerated to energies that enable them to produce corresponding @xmath9 rays @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-ray emission has been captured in the initial acceleration phase of the relativistic blob in the jet , which at any point in time radiates up to highest @xmath9-ray energies possible @xcite .",
    "3 .   an one - zone ssc model , which invokes a brief episode of increased particle injection at low energies @xcite .",
    "when assuming a simultaneous emission of the @xmath9-rays ( of different energies ) at the source at @xmath62 , an observed time delay can be converted in qg mass scales @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "as the measured time delay is marginal , they translate in a lower limit of @xmath71  gev ( 95% c.l . ) for the linear case and @xmath72  gev ( 95% c.l . ) for a quadratic dependence on energy @xcite .",
    "results for the 2005 june 30 exhibit a similar sensitivity , but this flare is not very significant . both limits increase further if any delay towards higher energies in the source itself is present .      in the night of 2006",
    "july 28 , the h.e.s.s .",
    "array @xcite observed a giant ( @xmath73 crab ) outburst of the blazar pks 2155304 , almost four times as distant as mkn 421 and mkn 501 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "also in this case , fast variability on the order of 3 minutes and an energy coverage up to a few tev is given @xcite .",
    "for searching for time delays , a mccf method @xcite and a wavelet method were employed , both yielding a zero time delay within errors , and thus @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "this translates into lower limits of @xmath77  gev and @xmath78  gev .",
    "most acceleration and cooling mechanisms scale in energy , although there is no definite need for a strong energy dependence . in x - ray observations , however , soft and hard lags have been observed ( most recently , e.g. , by @xcite ) , and lead to characteristic loops in flux ",
    "spectral hardness plots @xcite .",
    "those diagnostic plots may also be used in the vhe regime @xcite .",
    "intrinsic lags may strongly depend on the individual blazar and even on the individual flare , as the three agn outburts used for qg searches have proven . with our current understanding of blazar physics",
    ", intrinsic delays can not be corrected for individually .",
    "they will , however , not scale with the source distance , so robust conclusions on qg effects ultimately require the study of samples of very fast flaring objects at different redshifts .",
    "these are expected to be observed by the current and next - generation @xcite iacts and _ fermi _ thanks to the high sensitivity of these instruments .",
    "note that multi - wavelength observations of flares are complementary to qg searches and essential , as they will allow to study possible source - intrinsic mechanism and effects and enhance the understanding of agn source physics .",
    "any such understanding will enhance qg limits .",
    "note further that obviously source - instrinsic and qg effects may cancel out , leading to an observation of a null effect .",
    "this scenario has been dubbed `` conspiracy of nature '' @xcite and while it is still conceivable that both effects do exhibit the same timescale , but the opposite sign , also here a sample of blazar flares from blazars at different redshifts will help to separate an eventual qg effect from blazar physics .",
    "[ fig : qg ] shows the current blazar flare ensemble observed in vhe @xmath9-rays .",
    "high energy observations of fast pulses enable measurements of the energy dependence of the speed of light .",
    "such a possible liv is predicted by many qg models .",
    "an energy - dependent lag of tev @xmath9-rays on the 2.5-@xmath38 level has been observed in a flare of the blazar mkn 501 .",
    "the constraints derived from the @xmath79 times more distant blazar pks 2155304 , however , are consistent with a null result , as are robust ensemble analyses from grbs at a lower @xmath80 sensitivity . all in all",
    ", vhe observations of blazars constitute the most stringent limits on a linear ( pks 2155304 ) and quadratic ( mkn 501 ) energy dependence in the speed of light .",
    "future improvements in vhe searches may be expected from :    * even the high time - resolution iacts have not yet explored the shortest blazar variability timescales , although high photon statistics are available ; e.g. , more than 10,000 photons in the pks 2155304 flare .",
    "thus , only `` brighter flares '' or even more sensitive instruments will help to improve on @xmath81 .",
    "observing faster variations , or flares / subflares with shorter timescales ( say 30 seconds instead of currently 3 minutes ) , might increase the qg sensitivity by about * @xmath82*. grbs with their fine time structures are interesting to observe , particularly with _ fermi_. * gaining access to higher energy @xmath9-rays enlarges the lever arm in the qg sensitivity .",
    "however , the bright vhe blazars usually exhibit rather steep spectra , @xmath83 @xcite , thus it is rather unlikely to gain an order of magnitude more sensitivity , perhaps a factor * @xmath84 * is feasible . *",
    "it it difficult to improve much using the known bright , close - by blazars , as we have not yet seen flares exceeding the 15-crab level , even not during the giant 1997 flare of mkn 501 @xcite ; more distant blazars , however , seem to exhibit steep spectra ( e.g. 3c  279 @xcite ) , which are expected due to @xmath9-ray attenuation by the extragalactic background light @xcite . a major flare in ,",
    "e.g. , 3c  279 , extending the distance from @xmath85 to 0.54 , corresponds to a gain by * @xmath82 * in sensitivity .",
    "as discussed above , for robust ensemble studies , we need to find flares at various redshifts ; thus , improved iact facilities @xcite to reach lower energies than the currently reachable ( @xmath86  gev by magic ; @xmath87  gev by veritas / h.e.s.s . ) .",
    "_ fermi _ will regularly detect distant ( @xmath89 ) grbs , thus collecting statistics and be able to build a robust grb sample .",
    "this will increase the sensitivity for such a robust grb study by about * @xmath90*.    my thanks go to a. s. sakharov and the referee for helpful comments regarding this manuscript , as well as to the magic group at mpi for physics for its excellent support .",

    "<S> some models for quantum gravity ( qg ) violate lorentz invariance and predict an energy dependence of the speed of light , leading to a dispersion of high - energy gamma - ray signals that travel over cosmological distances . </S>",
    "<S> limits on the dispersion from short - duration substructures observed in gamma - rays emitted by gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) at cosmological distances have provided interesting bounds on lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) . </S>",
    "<S> recent observations of unprecedentedly fast flares in the very - high energy gamma - ray emission of the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) mkn 501 in 2005 and pks 2155304 in 2006 resulted in the most constraining limits on liv from light - travel observations , approaching the planck mass scale , at which qg effects are assumed to become important . </S>",
    "<S> i review the current status of liv searches using grbs and agn flare events , and discuss limitations of light - travel time analyses and prospects for future instruments in the gamma - ray domain .     </S>",
