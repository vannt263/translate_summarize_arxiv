    "we believe that the relativistic quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is a uniquely correct universal theory giving an exhaustive description of all interactions between electrons and photons including possible bound states like positronium . only our inability to calculate something out of perturbation method does not permit us to obtain all the desired details .",
    "earlier , some scientists considered that qed should have its own applicability region .",
    "a short review of the history and the development of quantum field theory is done in @xcite . supporting these doubts we will show in this paper that the sequential use of the standard qed does not give a correct description of the positronium spectra , namely , the ortho- para- positronium mass difference .",
    "first of all let us realize what is the status of bound states in non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( qm ) and relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) . in what follows , we restrict ourselves to the discussion of positronium in qed .",
    "the difference between qm and qft is shown in table i. let us give some comments .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath2 can be constructed in qm and qft . however , in qm @xmath3 is a well defined operator , so that the non - relativistic schrdinger equation is mathematically correct and time development of a quantum system can be described .",
    "solutions of the schrdinger equation contain both free and bound states .",
    "one can remark that in qm a bound state ( positronium ) is created by real particles ( electron - positron ) , i.e. constituent particles are on mass shell but are no virtual particles .    in qft",
    "the fock space @xmath4 is defined by the noninteracting free hamiltonian @xmath5 and contains the free particles only .",
    "however , @xmath6 is not defined on @xmath4 . as a result , the bound state as an eigenvalue problem of the relativistic schrdinger equation on the fock space",
    "can not be formulated mathematically in a correct way ( see @xcite ) . besides , the time development of quantum field system can not be obtained .",
    "the only way to overcome these problems is to construct the @xmath7-matrix which contains all elastic and inelastic scattering amplitudes of free particles from the time @xmath8 to the time @xmath9 .",
    "it is important that the @xmath7-matrix is a unitary operator on the fock space .",
    "it means that the bound states like positronium , which is a unstable particle , can not belong to any fock space in principle .",
    "in addition , our computing abilities are restricted to the perturbation theory .    nevertheless , we believe that the @xmath7-matrix amplitudes should contain some correct information on possible bound states . the simplest way to realize this idea is to postulate that a bound state is a simple pole of an elastic scattering amplitude of constituent particles with appropriate quantum numbers .",
    "it means , that the amplitudes out of mass shell and out of perturbation approach should be calculated .",
    "standard methods to go out of perturbation calculations are reduced to sum appropriate classes of feynman diagrams and this summation can be formulated in a form of integral equations .",
    "the best known approaches are the bethe - salpeter and schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "there is numerous literature devoted these equations ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the important difference comparable with the nonrelativistic case is that bound states in these equations are created by particles which are out of mass shell so that the role of time becomes important .",
    "one remark on these equations .",
    "we know that the perturbation series are asymptotic series so that the problem is how to sum them ?",
    "the exact amplitudes should have some singularity at the point @xmath10 in qed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "what is a precise character of this singularity is not known up to now .",
    "standard perturbation expansions are connected with feynman diagrams .",
    "usual methods are reduced to summation of an appropriate class of feynman diagrams .",
    "result of a summation of any definite class of feynman diagrams is a kind of geometrical progression , i.e. it is an analytic function at the point @xmath10 .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the generally accepted point of view - non - perturbed behavior is a sum of a definite class of feynman diagrams - is not true .",
    "one of probably successful proposals to calculate the relativistic corrections to bound state problem is the so - called non - relativistic qed ( nrqed ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea is that the qm is correct , only non - relativistic momenta are responsible for bound state properties . in other words ,",
    "the hamiltonian should not depend on time and the problem is to find somehow relativistically small corrections to the non - relativistic coulomb potential .",
    "the basic idea is that for small coupling constants the born approximation is a good approximation which is directly defined by the fourier transform of the potential . the aim is to extract from the relativistic @xmath7-matrix some relativistic corrections to non - relativistic hamiltonian .",
    "the hypothesis is that the scattering amplitudes in the non - relativistic schrdinger theory and the relativistic @xmath7-matrix theory should coincide in the low energy limit .",
    "the procedure is to write down the non - relativistic lagrangian with a set of all possible terms , and coefficients in front of them are calculated by identification with appropriate amplitudes of relativistic @xmath7-matrix .",
    "this prescription allows one to remove effectively time out of the relativistic equations , in other words , to place all intermediate particles on their mass shell .",
    "it seems nrqed is supported by experimental data .",
    "another quantum field idea is that a bound state is defined by an asymptotic behavior of the vacuum mean value of the corresponding relativistic currents ( see , for example , @xcite ) with desired quantum numbers : @xmath11 this formula gives a possibility to calculate the mass of the lowest bound state @xmath12 if @xmath13 .",
    "essentially , the space of states @xmath14 is supposed to contain possible bound states although we saw that the fock space can not contain unstable bound states . these vacuum mean values ( [ current ] ) can be represented in closed forms by functional methods .",
    "the functional methods permit one to get formally the exact representations for green functions which are not connected directly with feynman diagrams , so that it is possible to go out of standard perturbation expansions using asymptotic methods .",
    "development of functional methods permits one to get the exact character of non - analyticity at the point @xmath10 and to clarify the role of `` time '' in bound state formation .",
    "exactly this approach will be used in this paper .    the practically unique experimental object",
    "to investigate the bound state problems is the positronium which is the result of pure qed interaction . on the one hand ,",
    "the positronium is not a stable state .",
    "it can not belong to the asymptotic fock space .",
    "nevertheless , it exists .",
    "the binding energy of positronium itself is not measured with great accuracy but the mass difference of two possible states , ortho - positronium @xmath15 and para - positronium @xmath16 , is known with very large accuracy @xmath17 the main contribution can be explained by the non - relativistic breit potential approach ( see , for example , @xcite ) taking into account scattering and annihilation channels @xmath18    if we apply the relativistic current formula ( [ current ] ) to the positronium problem , we can write @xmath19 and annihilation channel looks like @xmath20 it means that the annihilation channel does not take part in the bound state formation in contradiction with the non - relativistic potential approach .    another point",
    ": we want to understand what is the role of time in formation of bound states .    in this paper",
    "we apply functional methods to calculate the asymptotic behavior of vacuum mean value ( [ current ] ) of relativistic currents for positronium and clarify the role of time in the formation of bound states .",
    "all our calculations will be performed in the euclidean space .",
