    "seismological calibration of stellar models against observed frequencies of low - degree modes was first discussed more than two decades ago @xcite , and can be regarded as a means of determining the main - sequence age of the sun @xcite .",
    "the procedure is to match certain appropriate seismic signatures of theoretical frequencies determined on a grid of stellar models with corresponding signatures obtained from the observations .",
    "the signatures are chosen to reflect principally the properties of the energy - generating core , where nuclear transmutation leaves behind an augmenting concentration of helium , lowering the sound speed relative to the environs and thereby providing a diagnostic of age .",
    "but the signatures are also susceptible to other properties of the stellar interior , which must be eliminated before a robust outcome can be achieved .",
    "for example , although the so - called small frequency separation is sensitive predominantly to the evolving stratification of the core , its dependence on the zero - age chemical abundances plays a significant contaminating role .",
    "therefore it behoves us to seek an additional diagnostic to attempt to measure abundance separately . for given relative abundances of the heavy elements , the total absolute heavy - element abundance @xmath3 and the @xmath4 abundance @xmath5",
    "are related by the requirement that the model has the observed luminosity and radius , principally the former .",
    "therefore we need to aim at detecting only one of them . here",
    "we use a signature indicative of the abrupt variation of the first adiabatic exponent @xmath6 induced by the ionization of helium .    , of low - degree solar frequencies from bison .",
    "top right : the symbols are second differences @xmath7 of adiabatic pulsation eigenfrequencies of solar model s. the solid curve in both panels is the diagnostic ( [ eq : delnu ] )  ( [ eq : secdiff ] ) , whose eleven parameters have been adjusted to fit the data optimally .",
    "bottom : the symbols denote contributions @xmath8 to the frequencies produced by the acoustic glitches of the sun ( left panel ) and model s ( right panel ) . ]",
    "any abrupt variation in the stratification of a star ( relative to the scale of the inverse radial wavenumber of a seismic mode of oscillation ) , which here we call an acoustic glitch , induces an oscillatory component in the spacing of the cyclic eigenfrequencies @xmath9 of seismic modes , of order @xmath10 and degree @xmath11 .",
    "our interest is principally in the glitch caused by the depression in the first adiabatic exponent @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are pressure , density and specific entropy ) caused by helium ionization .",
    "the deviation @xmath16 ( from now on we omit the subscripts @xmath17 ) of the eigenfrequency from the corresponding frequency @xmath18 of a similar smoothly stratified star is the indicator of @xmath5 that we use in conjunction with the indicators of core structure to determine the main - sequence age .",
    "approximate expressions for the frequency contributions @xmath8 arising from acoustic glitches in solar - type stars were recently presented by @xcite .",
    "here we improve them by adopting the appropriate airy functions ai@xmath19 that are used as comparison functions in the jwkb approximations to the oscillation eigenfunctions .",
    "the complete expression for @xmath8 is then given by @xmath20 where @xmath21\\cr & & \\hspace{-8pt } \\times\\bigl[\\mu\\beta\\int_0^t\\kappa^{-1}_{\\rm i } { \\rm e}^{-(\\tau-\\eta\\tau_{\\rm ii})^2/2\\mu^2\\delta^2_{\\rm ii}}|x|^{1/2 }    & & \\;\\;+\\;\\int_0^t\\kappa^{-1}_{\\rm ii } { \\rm e}^{-(\\tau-\\tau_{\\rm ii})^2/2\\delta^2_{\\rm ii}}|x|^{1/2 }    \\label{eq : delgamnu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] arises from the variation in @xmath6 induced by helium ionization , and @xmath22        \\!-\\!(16\\pi^2\\tilde{\\tau}_{\\rm c}^2\\nu^2\\!+\\!1)^{1/2 } \\right\\}\\ ,   \\label{eq : delcnu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] results from the acoustic glitch at the base of the convection zone .",
    "here , @xmath23 is a constant , being a representative polytropic index in the expression for the approximate effective phase @xmath24 appearing in the argument of the airy function , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants of order unity which account for the relation between the acoustic glitches caused by the first and second stages of ionization of helium @xcite ; @xmath28 is acoustic depth beneath the seismic surface of the star , and @xmath29 is the total acoustic radius of the star ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the centre and the width of the  acoustic glitch .",
    "the argument of the airy function is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 $ ] if @xmath34 , and @xmath35 $ ] if @xmath36 , in which @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the location of the upper turning point ; @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "also @xmath43+\\pi/4 $ ] , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the seven coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath31 , @xmath30 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 are found by fitting the second difference @xmath51 to the corresponding observations under the assumption that the errors in the frequency data are independent ( see top panels of figure1 ) .",
    "the last term in equation([eq : secdiff ] ) approximates smooth contributions arising , in part , from wave refraction in the stellar core , from hydrogen ionization and from the superadiabaticity of the upper boundary layer of the convection zone , introducing four more fitting coefficients @xmath52 ( @xmath530, ... ,3 ) .",
    "the outcome of the fitting to the bison data @xcite and to the adiabatically computed eigenfrequencies of solar model s @xcite is displayed in figure1 : the upper panels display the second differences , together with the fitted formula ( [ eq : secdiff ] ) , the lower panels display the corresponding contributions @xmath8 to the frequencies of oscillation from the acoustic glitches .    to the resulting smooth ( glitch free ) frequencies @xmath18 , derived from equation ( 1 ) , of both the solar observations @xcite and the eigenfrequencies of the reference solar model ( model s )",
    "was fitted the asymptotic expression @xmath54 where @xmath55 , from which we obtain the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 , each of which is an integral of a function of the equilibrium stratification , some of which are displayed in figure2 .",
    "the differences between the actual smoothed frequencies @xmath18 and the asymptotic expression ( [ eq : asymp ] ) are plotted in figure3 .",
    "we have carried out age calibrations using combinations of the parameters @xmath58 presuming , as is normal , that model s is parametrically close to the sun , we consider the solar value @xmath59 to be approximated by a two - term taylor expansion of @xmath60 about the value @xmath61 for models s : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the deviations of age @xmath0 and initial heavy - element abundance @xmath3 from models , and @xmath65 are the formal errors in the calibration parameters . a ( parametrically local ) maximum - likelihood fit ( again ,",
    "assuming that the errors in the observed frequencies are independent ) then leads to the following set of linear equations : @xmath66 in which @xmath67 , @xmath68  is the solution vector subject to ( correlated ) errors @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the covariance matrix of the errors @xmath65 , and @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 .     of the sun ( left ) and",
    "model s ( right ) , and the fitted asymptotic expression ( [ eq : asymp ] ) .",
    "modes of like degree @xmath11 are connected by solid lines . ]",
    "a similar set of equations is obtained for the formal errors @xmath69 : @xmath74 from which the error covariance matrix @xmath75 can be computed with a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the partial derivatives @xmath76 are obtained from two sets of five calibrated evolutionary models for the sun , computed with the evolutionary programme by @xcite , and adopting the livermoore equation of state and the opal92 opacities .",
    "one set of models has a constant value for the heavy - element abundance @xmath77 but varying age ; the other has constant age but varying @xmath3 .",
    "the values of the partial derivatives @xmath76 are listed in table2 .",
    "cccccc @xmath78&@xmath79 & @xmath80&@xmath81 & @xmath82_z$ ] & @xmath83_{t_\\odot}$ ] + -0.0469&-0.584&0.677&36.8&-0.00656&0.442 +",
    "age calibrations using the different combinations of the parameters @xmath60 are summarized in table3 ; error contours associated with the first entry are plotted in figure4 . in all cases the age found is greater than currently accepted values .",
    "the values of @xmath3 should not be regarded strictly as statements about the initial heavy - element abundance , but rather as measures of the opacity in the radiative interior .",
    "@xcite have argued that the photospheric abundances of c , n and o had previously been overestimated , suggesting that the actual total heavy - element abundance is rather lower than previously believed .",
    "however , that can not imply that the opacity in the solar interior is necessarily comparably lower because it has been implicitly calibrated here ( by accepting the tenets of solar - evolution theory , and the opal opacity calculations upon which the models are based ) , and indeed the opacity has already been determined seismologically from a broader spectrum of modes than has been adopted here @xcite .",
    "the matter raised by asplund etal . therefore challenges either the opacity calculations , the nuclear reaction rates , or the basic physics of stellar evolution , not helioseismology , as some spectators have surmised .",
    "as we know already from seismological structure inversions , the solar models are not accurate by helioseismological standards",
    ". therefore the properties inferred from these calibrations could be more contaminated by systematic error than by errors in the observed frequencies .",
