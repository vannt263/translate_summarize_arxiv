    "to date , more than 110 egps ( extrasolar giant planets ) have been discovered by the radial - velocity technique around stars with spectral types from m4 to f7 .",

    "given our all - too - narrow experience within the solar system , such variety and breadth was wholly unanticipated .",
    "importantly , two egps ( hd 209458b and ogle - tr-56b ) have been found to transit their primaries ( henry 2000 ; charbonneau 2000,2001 ; brown 2001 ; konacki 2003 ; torres et al .",

    "it is necessary to measure the planet s light from under the glare of the primary star at very high star - to - planet contrast ratios . to achieve this from the ground , telescopes such as the vlt interferometer ( paresce 2001 ) , the keck interferometer ( van belle and vasisht 1998 ; akeson and swain 2000 ; akeson , swain , and colavita 2001 ) , and the lbt nulling interferometer ( hinz 2001 ) will be enlisted . from space ,",

    ", our group has embarked upon a series of papers of egp spectra , evolution , chemistry , transits , orbital phase functions , and light curves .",
    "the most recent paper in this series ( sbh ) explored generic features of irradiated egp spectra as a function of orbital distance , cloud properties , and composition class ( sudarsky , burrows , and pinto 2000 ) .",
    "our technical approach vis  vis radiative transfer , molecular abundance determinations , and cloud modeling is described in detail in that paper , to which the interested reader is referred .",
    "however , sbh did not explore the diagnostics of planetary mass and age .",
    "in addition , in their study of the orbital distance dependence of egp spectra sbh did not incorporate the effects of water or ammonia clouds in a fully consistent fashion .",
    "in the current paper , we allow our atmosphere code to determine cloud placement in a fully iterative , converged fashion .",
    "the result is a consistent determination of the dependence on distance of the spectra of egps irradiated by a g2v star , including the effects of the water and ammonia clouds that should form in their atmospheres . in ",
    "[ numerical ] , we summarize our numerical approach .",
    "then in  [ distance_sequence ] we present and describe our results for the dependence of the spectra of irradiated egps on orbital distance . in this paper",
    ", we emphasize the results for egps at wider separations ( @xmath5 au ) and defer discussion of the corresponding theory for close - in egps to a later paper .",
    "this section treats the entire expected range of egp emission / reflection spectra and behavior . in ",
    "[ age_sequence ] , we provide a representative sequence of models that portray the dependence of irradiated egp spectra on age , at a given mass and orbital distance . in  [ mass_sequence ] , we present a representative sequence with egp mass , at a given age and orbital distance .",
    "section [ browndwarfs ] is a digression into the effect of stellar irradiation on companion brown dwarfs , characterized by much larger masses and more slowly decaying heat content .",
    "we study the signature in the optical of the reflection of stellar light from a companion brown dwarf .",
    "in fact , much of this paper is concerned with the signatures and diagnostics of the physical parameters of irradiated substellar - mass companions .",
    "however , it is not feasible in one paper to explore all the possible combinations of planetary mass , age , composition , orbital semi - major axis , eccentricity , and orbital phase with all stellar types .",
    "hence , to maintain a reasonable focus , we restrict our discussions to g2v primaries , zero eccentricity orbits , and solar metallicity .",
    "we narrow our scope further by plotting only phase - averaged spectra ( as in sbh ) at zero orbital inclination .",
    "papers on egp orbital phase functions , albedos , and light curves are to follow this one ( e.g. , sudarsky , burrows , and hubeny 2004 ) .",
    "these papers address the dependence on phase and keplerian parameters .",
    "finally , in  [ specific_egps ] we present predicted phase - averaged planet / star flux ratios for several known egps at wide separations and  [ conclusion ] reprises the essential conclusions of the paper .",
    "to calculate radiative / convective equilibrium atmospheres and spectra we use a specific variant of the computer program tlusty ( hubeny 1988 ; hubeny & lanz 1995 ) .",
    "this variant involves the hybrid complete linearization / accelerated lambda iteration ( cl / ali ) method , although in the present runs we use a full ali mode which leads to an essential saving of computer time without slowing down the iteration process significantly .",
    "in addition , we employ tlusty s discontinuous finite element ( dfe ) version ( castor , dykema , & klein 1992 ) . the dfe technique , being first order , is optimal for handling irradiated atmospheres ( sbh ) .",
    "all models are converged to one part in @xmath6 .",
    "stellar spectra from kurucz ( 1994 ) are used for the incoming fluxes at the outer boundaries .",
    "the inner boundary condition is the interior flux and this ( indexed by ) is taken from the evolutionary models of burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the given mass and age , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "this approximate procedure works well for wider - separation egps , but not as well for the closer - in egps ( @xmath7 au ) .",
    "we use a standard mixing - length prescription to handle convection and a mixing length of one pressure scale height .",
    "since the atmosphere code is planar , we use the redistribution technique descibed in sbh , i.e. we weight the incident flux by 1/2 to account for the average inclination of the planetary surface to the line of sight to the primary . as described in sbh , the planetary spectra we present here are phase / time - averaged over the orbit .",
    "care is taken with this procedure to ensure that energy is conserved and that energy @xmath8 ( from the star and the planetary interior ) equals energy @xmath9 . to account for the anisotropy of single scattering off of cloud particles ,",
    "we calculate using mie theory the average of the cosine of the scattering angle , and reduce the mie - theory - derived total scattering cross section by one minus this average . with this procedure , we are substituting the  transport cross section \" for the total scattering cross section .",
    "this approach has been shown to mimic the effect of asymmetric scattering quite well ( sudarsky , burrows , and pinto 2000 ) .    for molecular and atomic compositions , we use an updated version of the chemical code of burrows and sharp ( 1999 ) , which includes a prescription to account for the rainout of condensed species in a gravitational field and new thermochemical data .",
    "the derived molecular abundances are very similar to those obtained by lodders ( 1999 ) and lodders and fegley ( 2002 ) .",
    "our solar metallicity is defined as the elemental abundance pattern found in anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) . for molecular and atomic opacities , we have developed an extensive database , described in part in burrows et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and sbh .",
    "the treatment of h@xmath10o and nh@xmath11 clouds is done in a manner consistent with their respective condensation curves and the cloud base is put at the intersection of the corresponding condensation curve at solar metallicity with the object s temperature / pressure ( @xmath12 ) profile . in each iteration of the global ali scheme , we find a position of the cloud base as the intersection of the corresponding condensation curve with the current @xmath12 profile .",
    "the scale height of a cloud is assumed to be equal to one pressure scale height .",
    "we use mie theory for the absorptive and scattering opacities of particles whose model size is determined by the theory of cooper et al .",
    "in the subsequent iteration of the ali scheme , we employ this cloud opacity and scattering self - consistently in the radiative transfer equation and the energy balance equation . in the next ali iteration",
    "we again recalculate the position of the cloud base , and the whole process is repeated until the cloud position is fully stabilized .",
    "we note that in the initial stages of the global iteration process the cloud position may vary significantly ; in some case clouds appear ( disappear ) after several iterations of the cloudless ( cloudy ) atmosphere .",
    "this procedure ensures that the cloud position is self - consistent with the overall model atmosphere .",
    "this also means that the predicted cloud properties , in particular optical depths and base pressures , vary in a physical and consistent way with the orbital distance , mass , and age .",
    "figure [ auseq.c ] shows the @xmath12 profiles for the distance sequence from 0.2 to 15 au for a 1-egp irradiated by a g2v star . for specificity",
    ", we have assumed a radius of 1 and an internal flux  of 100 k for the entire family . according to the models of burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , this corresponds roughly to an age of 5 gyr , but after @xmath20.1 gyr , the radius and gravity of the egp vary little .",
    "the orbits are taken to be circular , so there is no assumed orbital phase dependence .",
    "the intercepts with the dashed lines identified by either \\{nh@xmath11 } or \\{h@xmath10o } denote the positions where the corresponding clouds form . due to the cold trap effect and depletion due to rainout ( burrows and sharp 1999 ) ,",
    "the higher - pressure intercept is taken to be at the base of the cloud .",
    "the spectral / atmospheric models include the effects of these clouds in a consistent way .",
    "table [ data.dist ] gives the modal particle sizes in microns that we derive using the theory of cooper et al .",
    "( 2003 ) when a cloud of either water or ammonia ( or both ) appears . for the ammonia clouds that form in this orbital distance sequence ( at @xmath13 au ) , the modal particle sizes we find hover near 50 - 60 .",
    "the corresponding particle sizes in the water clouds are near 110 .",
    "these particles are larger than for more massive smos .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the particle size does not vary with altitude and that the particle size distribution ( given a modal radius ) is that of deirmendjian ( 1964,1969 ) . clearly , a major ambiguity in egp modeling is cloud physics ( sbh ) .",
    "we have settled on the cooper et al .",
    "( 2003 ) theory to provide a consistent framework .",
    "when the chemistry indicates that both cloud types are present , we include them both in the atmospheric / spectral calculation . as fig .",
    "[ auseq.c ] shows , the ammonia cloud is always above the water cloud .",
    "water clouds form around a g2v star exterior to a distance near 1.5 au , whereas ammonia clouds form around such a star exterior to a distance near 4.5 au .",
    "note that jupiter itself is at the distance from the sun of @xmath25.2 au .",
    "for the closer - in objects , the @xmath12 profile manifests an inflection .",
    "this inflection is a consequence of the dominance of external radiation over the internal heat flux . for longer ages and low masses , the orbital distance at which one must place the smo / egp to erase",
    "this inflection is large .",
    "for this model set , that distance is @xmath22 au . for larger masses , dimmer primaries , and shorter ages ,",
    "that distance decreases .",
    "in addition , the strong irradiation that produces the inflection in the @xmath12 profile also forces the radiative / convective boundary to recede to higher pressures . for a 1-egp at an orbital distance of 0.05 au ( not shown ) around a g2v star , this pressure can be greater than 1000 bars ! such is the case for hd 209458b and ogle - tr56b ( burrows , sudarsky , and hubbard 2003 ; fortney et al .",

    "2003 ) for the ice particles of the water clouds that appear in this evolutionary sequence , as well as the inner flux , gravity , and planet radius as this 1-egp evolves according to the theory of burrows et al .",
    "the modal particle size is very roughly constant with age .",
    "the radius of the 1-egp decreases by @xmath215% from 0.1 to 5 gyr . not surprisingly , at a distance of 4 au",
    "no inflection in the @xmath12 profile is produced .",
    "note that at this orbital distance and as early as @xmath250 myr ( not shown ) , water clouds form in jovian - mass objects .",
    "note also that at 4 au , even after 5 gyr ammonia clouds have not yet formed in the atmosphere of an irradiated 1-egp .",
    "this is not true for a similar object in isolation ( burrows , sudarsky , and lunine 2003 ) .",
    "figure [ contrastd ] depicts the planet - to - star flux ratios from 0.5 to 30 for the orbital distance study associated with the @xmath12 profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ auseq.c ] . in the optical ,",
    "the flux ratios vary between 10@xmath14 and 10@xmath15 . in the near infrared",
    ", this ratio varies widely from @xmath210@xmath16 to 10@xmath17 .",
    "however , in the mid - infrared beyond 10 , the flux ratio varies more narrowly from 10@xmath16 to 10@xmath18 .",
    "hence , it makes a difference in what wavelength region one conducts a search for direct planetary light .",
    "gaseous water absorption features ( for all orbits ) and methane absorption features ( for the outer orbits ) sculpt the spectra .",
    "the reflected component due to rayleigh scattering and clouds ( when present ) is most manifest in the optical and the emission component ( similar to the spectrum of an isolated low - gravity brown dwarf ) takes over at longer wavelengths . for the egps interior to @xmath21.0 au ,",
    "the fluxes longward of @xmath20.8 are primarily due to thermal emission , not reflection .",
    "these atmospheres do not contain condensates and are heated efficiently by stellar irradiation . as a result , the @xmath19 ( @xmath21.0 ) , @xmath20 ( @xmath21.2 ) , @xmath21 ( @xmath21.6 ) , and @xmath22 ( @xmath22.2 ) band fluxes are larger by up to several orders of magnitude than those of the more distant egps . generally , clouds increase a planet s flux in the optical , while decreasing it in the @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( @xmath23.5 ) , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25.0 ) bands .",
    "the transition between the reflection and emission components moves to longer wavelengths with increasing distance , and is around 0.8 - 1.0 at 0.2 au and @xmath23.0 at 15 au .",
    "however , since the irradiation and atmospheric structure and spectra are being calculated self - consistently , emission and reflection components are in fact inextricibly intertwined and it is not conceptually correct to separate them .    at large distances exterior to @xmath23.5 au ,",
    "the flux longward of @xmath215 manifests undulations due to pressure - induced absorption by h@xmath10 .",
    "importantly , there is always a significant bump around the @xmath24 band at 4 - 5 .",
    "the peak of this bump shifts from @xmath24 to @xmath25 with increasing orbital distance .",
    "though muted by the presence of clouds , it is always a prominent feature of irradiated egps , as it is in t dwarfs and the jovian planets of our solar system .",
    "curiously , but not unexpectedly , as fig . [ contrastd ] indicates , the planet / star flux ratio is most favorable in the mid - infrared .",
    "this fact should be of some interest to those planning tpf or successor missions to the spitzer space telescope .",
    "though the major trend is a monotonic decrease in a planet s flux with increasing orbital distance , the 0.2-au model atmosphere is hot enough that the sodium and potassium resonance absorption lines appear and surpress the flux around na - d ( 0.589 ) and the related k i doublet at 0.77 .",
    "the result is a lower integrated visible flux that is comparable to that of the otherwise dimmer 0.5-au model .",
    "figures [ contrastd.2 ] and [ contrastd.2b ] focus in on the 0.5 to 2.0 region and allow one to distinguish one model from another at shorter wavelengths more easily than is possible in the panoramic fig . [ contrastd ] .",
    "these figures allow us to see that for greater orbital distances , the atmospheric temperatures are too low for the alkali metals to appear , but the methane features near 0.62 , 0.74 , 0.81 , and 0.89 come into their own .",
    "broad water bands around 0.94 , 1.15 , 1.5 and 1.85 that help to define the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 bands are always in evidence , particularly for the 0.2 and 1.0 au models that do nt contain water clouds .",
    "for greater distances , the presence of water clouds slightly mutes the variation with wavelength in the planetary spectra .",
    "hence , smoothed water features and methane bands predominate beyond @xmath21.5 au .",
    "figure [ contrasta ] presents the planet - to - star flux ratios from 0.5 to 6.0 for a 1-egp orbiting a g2v star at 4 au as a function of age .",

    "the depicted ages are 0.1 , 0.3 , 1 , 3 , and 5 gyr .",
    "these planet parameters are chosen merely to represent the systematics with age ; different egp masses and orbital distances will yield quantitatively different spectra .",
    "table [ data.age ] shows that for this suite of models the internal flux varies from 290 k to 103 k , the surface gravity varies from 1695 cm s@xmath25 to 2325 cm s@xmath25 , and the planet radius varies from 1.17 to 1.0 .    as is clear from fig .",
    "[ contrasta ] , younger egps with higher inner boundary ( table [ data.age ] ) have much higher fluxes in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath24 bands",
    ". however , the older objects , having cooled more , have lower internal luminosities .",
    "this results in lower fluxes in those same bands by as much as two orders of magnitude . as figure [ ageseq.c ] shows ,",
    "the older egps have progressively deeper water clouds .",
    "what is not obvious from figure [ ageseq.c ] is that these clouds are also thicker .",
    "this results in a very slightly increasing reflected optical flux with increasing age that accompanies the reverse trend in the near infrared .",
    "hence , the fluxes in the optical shortward of @xmath21.0 are only weak functions of age , while the fluxes in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath24 bands at early ages are strong functions of age . at later ages , the formation of water clouds moderates the age dependence of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 band fluxes .",
    "in fact , there can be slight increases in flux in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 bands with increasing age .",
    "however , the @xmath24 band flux continues to be diagnostic of age , monotonically decreasing by almost two orders of magnitude from 0.1 to 5 gyr .",
    "hence , the best diagnostics of age are in the near infrared , not the optical .",

    "due to the 5-gyr age assumed , all these models have water clouds and the derived modal particle sizes decrease monotonically with increasing mass from 146 at 0.5 to 39 at 8 . in general , the larger the egp mass , the higher in the atmosphere the clouds form , but cloud position is not fully monotonic at the low - mass end of the sequence .    for higher mass , at a given age an egp s inner  and internal luminosity are higher .",
    "this results in higher fluxes in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath24 bands for higher masses and is similar to the trend seen in  [ age_sequence ] with decreasing age .",
    "however , larger - mass egps also have higher surface gravities , which result in water clouds with lower column depths , and , hence , lower optical depths , despite the contrary trend of modal particle size ( table [ data.mass ] ) .",
    "the upshot is that higher - mass egps have slightly smaller planet / star flux ratios in the optical .",
    "this optical component is due to reflection off of cloudy atmospheres with roughly similar compositions .",

    ", a stellar spectrum from kurucz ( 1994 ) for the primary stellar type given for each egp in table [ data.specific ] is used for the outer irradiation boundary condition in the self - consistent atmosphere / spectrum calculation . as a comparison of figs .",
    "[ contrastd ] , [ contrastd.2 ] , and [ contrastd.2b ] with figs .",
    "[ c39 ] , [ c77 ] , and [ c47 ] demonstrates , the major dependence of the planet - to - star flux ratio is with orbital distance .",
    "note that for all of the egps listed in table [ data.specific ] , the assumption that the planet - star distance is fixed at the measured semi - major axis does not result in the formation of ammonia clouds .",
    "however , such clouds should form near apastron for the known egps with large semi - major axes and high eccentricities , such as @xmath29 eri b and 55 cnc d. the appearance and disappearance of such clouds with orbital phase would be exciting signatures to detect .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated theoretical phase - averaged planet / star flux ratios in the optical , near - infrared , and mid - infrared for wide - separation irradiated egps as a function of orbital distance , mass , and age . we have also predicted the corresponding quantities for 12 specific known egps , given their corresponding primary spectra , average orbital distances , approximate masses , and approximate ages .",
    "hence , we have explored various physical diagnostics that can inform the direct egp detection programs now being planned or proposed . in the optical , the flux ratios for distances from 0.2 au to 15 au and masses from 0.5 to 8 can vary from slightly above 10@xmath14 to @xmath210@xmath15 . in the near infrared around 2 - 4 , the flux ratio ranges more widely , spanning values from 10@xmath16 to as low as 10@xmath17 . at @xmath2 5 ,",
    "the planet / star flux ratio ranges approximately four orders of magnitude and can be as high as 10@xmath16 . the @xmath24 band should be a useful region to explore and @xmath24-band fluxes are sensitive to the presence of clouds .",
    "for all models , the mid - infrared from 10 to 30 is always encouragingly high .",
    "in fact , for closer separations ( 0.05 au-0.1 au ) , not the subject of this paper , the flux ratio at @xmath220 can be @xmath2@xmath30 .    depending upon orbital distance , age , and mass , spectral features due to methane , water , and the alkali metals are prominent .",
    "furthermore , there is a slight anti - correlation in the effects of clouds in the optical and infrared , with the optical fluxes increasing and the infrared fluxes decreasing with increasing cloud depth . for young and massive irradiated egps",
    ", there are prominent peaks in the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath24 bands .",
    "though the optical flux is not a very sensitive function of age , there is a useful age dependence of the fluxes in these bands .",
    "furthermore , there is an anti - correlation with increasing mass at a given age and orbital distance between the change in flux in the optical and in the near - ir bands , with the optical fluxes decreasing and the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath24 band fluxes increasing with increasing mass .",
    "the spectra of more massive smos ( brown dwarfs ) longward of @xmath20.9 are not significantly affected by stellar irradiation .",
    "their internal heat content and interior fluxes are too large .",
    "however , brown dwarf fluxes from 0.4 to 0.65 , can be enhanced by rayleigh reflection by as much as a factor of 10 .",
    "this is particularly true of old or low - mass brown dwarfs and is a predictable function of distance .",
    "moreover , irradiation can alter the profile shape of the na - d feature significantly .",
    "we are not able to calculate egp spectra for all possible combinations of mass , age , composition , orbital distance , eccentricity , orbital phase , keplerian element , and primary spectral type .",
    "this fact is what motivates the more modest synoptic view we have provided in this paper .",
    "however , in the process of developing the tools for this study , we have established the capability to calculate egp spectra for any combination of these parameters . in particular , sudarsky , burrows , and hubeny ( 2004 ) address the orbital phase and eccentricity dependences of irradiated egps spectra",
    ".    the remote sensing of the atmospheres of egps will be challenging , but the detection and characterization of the direct light from a planet outside our solar system will be an important milestone in both astronomy and planetary science .",
    "one instrument proposed to meet this challenge is the space - based coronagraphic imager _ eclipse _",
    "( trauger et al .",
    "2000,2001 ) .",
    "the _ eclipse _ instrument team is predicting a contrast capability of @xmath210@xmath31 for an inner working angle of 0.3@xmath32 or 0.46@xmath32 in the @xmath26/@xmath33 or @xmath19 bands , respectively . as figs .",
    "[ contrastd ] through [ contrastm ] indicate , with such a capability irradiated egps could be detected and analyzed .",
    "many could even be discovered .",
    "however , whether such sensitivity is achievable remains to be demonstrated .",
    "be that as it may , further advancement in our understanding of extrasolar planets is contingent upon technical advances that would enable the direct measurement of the dynamically dominant and brighter components of extrasolar planetary systems , the egps .",
