    "one of the most inspiring aspects of quantum physics is the possibility of generation a quantum superpositions of two more macroscopic , classically distinguishable , interfering states .",
    "this idea is closely related to the famous schrdinger cat paradox @xcite , where the cat is set to be alive and dead with equal probabilities until the measurement is made .",
    "this state is entangled to the device that can kill the cat . in recent literature",
    "just the superposition of two coherent states with a @xmath1 phase difference and a large amplitude inherited the name , and is referred as a cat state .",
    "a superposition of more than two coherent states is called a kitten state .",
    "the cat and kitten states have brought a lot of interest of physicists due to many possible applications in quantum information processing @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum nonlocality tests @xcite , generation and purification of entangled coherent states @xcite , and quantum computation and communication @xcite .",
    "those states are also very useful for investigation of the decoherence process @xcite .",
    "so far , a superposition of two coherent states has been successfully generated for phonon modes of a single trapped ion @xcite and superconducting cavity @xcite .",
    "a lot of effort has been made to investigate the possibility of photon coherent state superposition generation using kerr nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "however , the nonlinearity is far too small to ensure the effective method of the state preparation .",
    "the aim of this article is to focus on the possibilities of the coherent state superposition generation , which are offered by the trapped ions in a paul trap .",
    "the ion traps have generated a lot of interest due to their possible applications in quantum information theory  @xcite and quantum computation  @xcite . in different experiments , fock number states  @xcite , coherent states",
    "@xcite , vacuum squeezed states  @xcite , and schrdinger cat states  @xcite has been realized .",
    "according to our knowledge , neither non - gaussian states ( other than cat state ) nor a superposition of more than two coherent states have been observed so far .",
    "the presented method allows for the generation of two and more , eg .",
    "six , coherent states superposition .",
    "it is closely related to the kerr nonlinear interaction .",
    "it is experimentally feasible for coherent states with the amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "let us begin the discussion with a brief summary of a kerr state and a kerr medium .",
    "the one - mode kerr state results from an interaction of a coherent state of light @xmath2 with a third - order @xmath3 nonlinear medium , the kerr medium @xcite .",
    "the optical fibers are the best known example of the kerr medium .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interaction in the ideal medium , without damping and thermal noise , is of the following form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are annihilation and creation operators of the light mode .",
    "the strength of the medium is given by the nonlinear constant @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the frequency of the injected light beam , @xmath9 is the linear refractive index and @xmath10 is the volume of quantization .",
    "the one - mode kerr state is an infinite superposition of different photon number states ( fock states ) @xmath11 its properties are characterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a time that the light has spent in the fiber .",
    "although the statistics of the kerr state is poissonian , @xmath14 , this is a squeezed state .",
    "this fact can be easily observed from the evolution of its electric field quadrature uncertainties @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are amplitude and phase quadratures .",
    "depending on @xmath18 , the quadratures are squeezed alternately : the quantum fluctuations in one quadrature are reduced below the vacuum level , @xmath19 , at the expense of increased fluctuations in the other one , see fig.[quadratures ] .",
    "if none of them is squeezed for a given value of @xmath18 , the squeezing will not be seen in the principal axes directions but for quadratures at a certain angle .",
    "this fact corresponds to the rotation of the error contour in the phase space .",
    "the kerr state is a non - gaussian quantum state .",
    "this information can be obtained from its wigner phase space function : it takes the negative values and it is not rotational symmetric . the wigner function can be computed and expressed in two equivalent ways @xmath20 }      \\left(\\partial_{\\gamma}\\right)^n      \\left(\\partial_{\\gamma^*}\\right)^m      e^{-4|\\gamma|^2}.\\nonumber\\\\ { } \\label{derivatives}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the examples of the wigner function evaluated for @xmath21 and two values of evolution parameter @xmath22 and @xmath23 are depicted on fig .",
    "[ wigner_a_5 ] .",
    "the distribution starting with a circular shape genuine to a coherent state turns into an ellipse and the state becomes squeezed - the left figure .",
    "it also shows that the kerr state approximates a one - mode gaussian squeezed state for @xmath24 very well .",
    "then , the ellipse is stretched into a banana shape - the right figure .",
    "this plot reveals the nonclassicality of the state : the negative values of the wigner function form a tail of interference fringes following the `` main '' part of the `` banana '' distribution .",
    "the evolution of a coherent state in a kerr medium is periodic : the phase factor in the kerr state ( [ kerr ] ) is a periodic function of the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "therefor , we achieve the same state for @xmath18 and @xmath25 . moreover , if @xmath18 is taken as a fraction of the period of the evolution , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a rational number , the infinite sum of fock states breaks into a finite sum of coherent states , all of the same amplitude but different phases @xcite .",
    "this effect is also known as a fractional revival  @xcite .    below we present the cat and kitten states - the superpositions of 2 - 6 coherent states - and their wigner functions obtained from the kerr state ( [ kerr ] ) for some specific values of @xmath18 and @xmath28 , fig .",
    "[ wigner_1]-[wigner_3 ] .    to    to    setting @xmath29",
    "the kerr state becomes a superposition of six coherent states @xmath30 with the following coefficients : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "we have five coherent states for @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .    for @xmath40 we have superposition of four states @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 .    if @xmath44 the kerr state becomes superposition of three states @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "we achieve the usual cat state , the superposition of two coherent states , for @xmath47 @xmath48 approximated cat and kitten state generation using ion traps ------------------------------------------------------------    all the presented kitten states ( [ cat_6 ] ) - ( [ cat_2 ] ) can be generated using current technology available for the ion traps and already existing theoretical schemes for an ion arbitrary pure state preparation , if the amplitude of the coherent state is not too large .",
    "we show that the small kitten states can be very well approximated by a superposition of only few fock states with appropriate chosen coefficients .",
    "it means that only a small number of fock states in eq .",
    "( [ kerr ] ) is of real significance and the sum can be cut off at some @xmath49 .",
    "we analyze the dependence of this number @xmath50 on the initial coherent state amplitude @xmath51 .    a method of preparing an ion in a paul trap  @xcite in a finite superposition of fock states with arbitrary coefficients @xmath52 has been proposed in @xcite . in the above formula",
    "@xmath53 is an ion motional fock state , defined according to a harmonic oscillator potential in the trap , @xmath54 .",
    "the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the ion electronic ground and excited states .",
    "the method is based on applying a series of laser pulses tuned to the carrier frequency and the red sideband of the ion trap alternately .",
    "it works both in and beyond the lamb - dicke regime .    adjusting the time of laser pulses or their rabi frequency we can obtain @xmath57 in that case we generate the approximated cat state applying @xmath58 laser pulses @xmath59    to    the choice of the value @xmath50 of the cut off in the sum ( [ kerr ] )",

    "[ comparision_2 ] .",
    "to    therefor , we assume that @xmath64 approximates the cat state for @xmath28 good enough , which means that @xmath65 laser pulses are required for its preparation .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath50 is approximately equal to the number of significant number of coefficients in the sum ( [ kerr ] ) .",
    "below we present the plots of absolute values of @xmath66 , eq .",
    "( [ coefficients ] ) , as a function of @xmath67 for @xmath68 , @xmath28 and @xmath21 .",

    "to    the value of the amplitude eg .",
    "@xmath21 requires about @xmath69 pulses and the decoherence effects would have to be compensated for during the preparation .",
    "such an amplitude also requires higher number states in eq .",

    "in this paper we have presented a method of an effective approximated coherent superposition state generation for a single trapped ion in a paul trap .    at first , the ion is prepared in its ground state , both in motional and electronic state .",
    "then , step by step , the state is built up applying a series of laser pulses tuned to the carrier resonance and red sideband interaction alternately .    fixing the amplitude of the coherent state , we can approximate the cat state arbitrary well , increasing the number of applied pulses .    the cat and kitten states with their amplitude @xmath0",
    "are very well approximated by a state which is available applying @xmath65 laser pulses .",
