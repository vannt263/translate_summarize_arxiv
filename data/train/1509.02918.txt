    "the equivalence of the gravitational and the inertial mass of macroscopic test masses of ordinary matter has been tested to very high precision , e.g. with a differential measurement of be and ti masses using a highly sophisticated torsion balance  @xcite .",
    "gravitational acceleration of ordinary matter atoms in the earth gravitational field has also been measured to high precision , e.g. using atom interferometry methods  @xcite .",
    "neutral kaon oscillations have been used to set very tight constraints on differences in the gravitational interaction of their constituents , see e.g.  @xcite and arguments have been extended using all neutral meson oscillations  @xcite . while it may therefore be very improbable to find some general antigravity , similar arguments as put forward already in  @xcite can still be applied and the gravitational interaction may perhaps be much more complex and allow for cancellations in some systems .",
    "a first crude limit has been set on the antihydrogen gravitational acceleration  @xcite , however , neither decisive yet in its magnitude nor in its sign .",
    "the precise measurement of antimatter gravity in various systems may serve as an important input for constructing theories of quantum gravity and it could potentially provide insights to dark matter and dark energy which remain mysterious until today .",
    "muonium ( mu ) is the hydrogen like bound state of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it has been studied extensively since the 1960s to test bound state qed , to determine fundamental parameters and to search for exotic physics  @xcite .",
    "it can be reliably calculated within qed because it is purely leptonic and essentially free of hadronic effect .",
    "it can live relatively long , limited by the muon life time ( @xmath2  @xmath3s ) .",
    "its 1s-2s transition frequency  @xcite and the hyperfine splitting of the ground state  @xcite have been measured to high precision ( 4 ppb and 12 ppb ) .    in recent years",
    ", there is a renewed interest in physics with mu atoms , triggered by new ideas for much improved slow muon and muonium beams and by progress in laser technology .",
    "measuring mu s gravitational interaction with ordinary matter would be complementary to such measurements with antihydrogen and positronium and would be the first test for this second generation leptonic system where the mass is dominated by the heavy @xmath4 .",
    "two very different approaches for a mu gravity experiment are being considered :    * search for an annual modulation of the mu(1s-2s ) transition frequency  @xcite * use a high quality mu beam passing through a mach zehnder atom interferometer  @xcite    our group is pursuing research into both directions and developing the necessary experimental prerequisites . some technical challenges and the current situation of research and development will be sketched in the following sections .",
    "first proposed for positronium 1s-2s spectroscopy  @xcite , the main idea of this method is to utilize the gravitational redshift , where the frequency of a photon is changed depending on the gravitational potential .",
    "when the earth is orbiting the sun , their distance varies by about 5.0 x 10@xmath5  km during the year , corresponding to 3.2 x 10@xmath6 in terms of relative frequency shift  @xcite .",
    "hence , a precision level of about 0.1  ppb is needed to be sensitive to an effect which could shift the mu transition frequency with respect to a frequency reference based on an ordinary matter system .",
    "the required sensitivity implies a 40-fold improvement in the measurement of mu 1s-2s transition frequency .",
    "this improvement requires : a ) highest possible slow @xmath0 rate ( e.g. , 4000@xmath0/s at lem  @xcite facility at psi ) , b ) highest possible @xmath7 slow mu conversion rate ( e.g. , mesoporous silica  @xcite ) , c ) high power continuous wave laser ( based on the development of , e.g. , ps 1s-2s at ethz  @xcite ) and d ) a better known reference frequency ( e.g. , i@xmath8 calibration via frequency comb  @xcite ) .      ,",
