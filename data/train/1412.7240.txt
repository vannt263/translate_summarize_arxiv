    "since 1980 s , supernova neutrinos have been a focus of our attention for a long time @xcite-@xcite . in recent years",
    ", the issues about neutrino detection experiments and simulations of supernova explosion have always been hotspots in scientific research fields @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thanks to the results of simulations and development of theories on supernovae , the whole process of supernova explosion has been understood much better now @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the post bounce period , one stage in the process of supernova explosion , can be divided generally into the accretion phase and the cooling phase . during the supernova explosion ,",
    "both the collective effects and the shock wave effects play important roles in neutrino oscillations @xcite@xcite . as we know , in the post bounce period , a large number of supernova neutrinos go through the supernova matter , carrying an enormous amount of energy , and emit from the supernova @xcite@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the spreading outward energy makes significant changes to the supernova matter and arouses the shock wave , which has an impact on neutrino oscillations in the supernova @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the essence of the shock wave effect is the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect , caused by the interactions of neutrinos with matter and dominated by the density profile of the supernova as well as neutrino mixing angles @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the neutrino crossing probability in the high resonance , @xmath0 , will experience complex changes resulting from the high - density and unstable matter in the supernova @xcite-@xcite . in the past",
    ", the simplified model of supernova density profile , which only contains the forward shock wave , was used to study the behavior of @xmath0 @xcite . with this method",
    ", we could roughly figure out the impact of the shock wave effects on neutrino oscillations in the supernova @xcite-@xcite .",
    "afterwards , it was found that besides the forward shock wave there would be a reverse shock wave and some turbulence existing in the supernova during the process of explosion , all of which have influences on neutrino oscillations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "presently , from the results of simulations aiming at different supernova models , it is known that the actual density profiles in supernova are distinctly different from one to another due to the difference of their masses @xcite@xcite .",
    "for this reason , the original simplified model of the density profile can not provide the images of time - varying densities in different supernova models comprehensively .",
    "therefore , one has to find out the images in other ways .",
    "one possible way is to get new simplified density profiles according to the simulation results of different supernova models , respectively . in this way",
    ", it is necessary to do data analysis and fitting for densities , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "therefore , we decide to use the simulation results of supernova density profiles to discuss the variations of @xmath1 ( the survival probability of @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( the conversion probability of @xmath4 , @xmath6 represents @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) instead of applying the simplified model of density profiles to study the behavior of @xmath0 .    this paper is divided into five parts . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review about neutrino oscillations in matter . in section 3 ,",
    "we use the simulation results of three supernova models to give the images of time - varying density profiles in order to find the similarities and differences among them . in section 4 , based on the theory in section 2 and using the density data in section 3 , we calculate @xmath1 , @xmath3 and the ratio of @xmath5 remained after neutrinos go through the matter in three supernova models .",
    "in addition , we compare the diverse appearances of shock waves among these supernova models and extract how the time - dependent matter affects neutrino oscillations in supernovae .",
    "the last section consists of a summery and some discussions of this paper .",
    "neutrinos might be regarded as either a dirac or a majorana particle .",
    "no matter which kind of particle it is , eliminating the spin structure from its propagation equation yields the klein - gordon equation @xcite . in the flavor basis ,",
    "different from the case in vacuum , the propagation equation of neutrino in matter has a potential energy item , which stems from the interactions between neutrinos and matter , @xmath9u^{\\dagger}+\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}a&0\\\\0&0\\\\\\end{array}\\right]\\right]\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in eq .",

    ", the new data about @xmath34 have been provided by some neutrino experiments @xcite@xcite-@xcite@xcite@xcite . in the following",
    ", we will use @xmath37 provided by the daya bay collaboration @xcite .    by solving eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we can get how @xmath5 and @xmath6 evolute with distance , then the survival probability and conversion probability are given as follows : @xmath38",
    "in the previous study , we used the simplified density profile to represent the real state of density without considering the mass of the supernova @xcite-@xcite . in this section , based on simulation data we can provide the density profiles at different times in three supernova models .",
    "these three supernova models are 8.8 , 10.8 and 18 times the mass of the sun , respectively , so they will be called as the 8.8@xmath39 model , the 10.8@xmath39 model and the 18@xmath39 model respectively for simplicity in the following .      in fig .",
    "1 it is shown how the density changes with the radius within 6 seconds after the supernova explosion in the 8.8@xmath39 model .",
    "it can be seen that on each density curve there is an obvious decrease at about @xmath40 km of radius , and this decline gets more and more notable with the increase of time .",
    "for example , at the time of 0.2 s , the density declines about @xmath41 g/@xmath42 from 10 km to @xmath43 km , while when @xmath44 = 6 s , the density declines about @xmath45 g/@xmath42 from 10 km to @xmath40 km . after the sharp decrease",
    ", the density continues to decline , but relatively slowly . in this slow - decline stage , from @xmath43 km - @xmath46 km , the density goes down about @xmath47 g/@xmath42 .",
    "except for the curve of 1 s , at the end of other curves , there is an abnormal increase of density .",
    "compared with the rise with some twists and turns on the curves of 2 s @xmath48 6 s , at the end of 0.2 s and 0.5 s curves , the densities ascend slight increases . yet on the curve of 1 s , there is no obvious increase at all .",
    "overall , in the 8.8@xmath39 model , no matter what time it is , the density decreases with the increase of radius if we do not take the ends of the curves into account .",
    "it is worth noting that the so - called shock wave caused by the changing density does not appear in the 8.8@xmath39 model at all .",
    "this is remarkably different from the simplified density profile we used previously @xcite .      in fig .",
    "2 , there are 11 curves to demonstrate how the density varies with the radius at different times in the 10.8@xmath39 model .    similar to fig .",
    "1 , there is an abrupt density decrease at about @xmath40 km of radius on each curve in fig .",
    "2 . then the density continues to decline slowly in comparison with the previous sharp decrease . during this phase",
    ", it can be observed that there is a density `` bulge '' on each curve , which is the forward shock wave we studied before . at 0.5 s",
    ", it seems that this shock wave is a bit fuzzy , but after 1 s it becomes more and more evident and moves forward with time . on the curves of @xmath49 3",
    "s , it can be seen that there is a density `` concave '' located behind the forward shock wave .",
    "that is the reverse shock wave , resulting from the supernova matter squeezing with the end of the shock wave . just like the forward shock wave",
    ", the reverse shock wave also moves forward with time . on the curves of @xmath49 6",
    "s , a small density `` bump '' appears on the forward shock wave , indicating that the changes of matter within the forward shock wave are very complicated .",
    "this phenomenon has never be mentioned before @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is found that all the curves in fig . 2 converge to a line at the end of themselves . through the curve fitting method , it is found that this converging line can be represented by @xmath50 approximately , in close proximity to @xmath51 , which is known as the expression of density distribution in a stable supernova as mentioned in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite .",
    "same as fig .",
    "2 , fig . 3 shows the density profiles at 11 different points of time in the 18@xmath39 model . just like the two former models",
    ", the density in the 18@xmath39 model also decreases rapidly at about @xmath40 km judged from the appearance of each curve and then the density declines gradually .",
    "on the curve of @xmath44 = 0.5 s , it seems that the forward shock wave is forming but not complete yet . while on other curves",
    ", it can be seen clearly that there is a forward shock wave moving with time . also at the end of all curves ,",
    "the density profiles of different times converge into a line . compared with fig .",
    "2 , in which there is a density `` concave '' on the curves of @xmath49 3 s , it is found that the reverse shock wave is not formed throughout in the 18@xmath39 model .    the above three figures of density profiles have something in common",
    "that is , at about @xmath40 km of radius , there is an obvious density decline which gets more and more abrupt with time .",
    "it might be assumed that the core of the supernova , which is incredibly dense , is collapsing more and more quickly with time .",
    "what is more , these three figures indicate that the mass of the supernova is very closely related to the shape of shock wave .",
    "if the mass is not big enough , taking the 8.8@xmath39 model as an example , there would be no shock wave ( neither the forward shock wave nor the reverse shock wave ) appearing in the supernova .",
    "however , if the supernova mass is too massive , for instance , the 18@xmath39 model , the reverse shock wave would not arise in it .",
    "in other words , only when the mass of the supernova is neither too small nor too big , and within a certain range ( from the three models , this range should be @xmath52 the mass of sn @xmath53 ) , both the forward shock wave and the reverse shock wave will be generated in it .",
    "moreover , the forward shock wave and the reverse shock wave do not appear at the same time .",
    "the forward shock wave is formed within one second after the supernova explosion , while the reverse shock wave can been seen clearly after about 3 second of explosion .",
    "in the previous section , the density profiles in three supernova models are displayed graphically and we have already known that in the 8.8@xmath39 model shock wave never exist and in the 18@xmath39 model only the forward shock wave can be generated , while both the forward and the reverse shock wave are formed in the 10.8@xmath39 model during the explosion . no matter whether the shock wave exist and no matter how its appearance is , as long as we know the data of density profiles in supernova models , with the theory of neutrino oscillations in matter as formulated in section 2 , we can calculate the survival probability of @xmath2 , as well as the conversion probability of @xmath4 . given the discrete density values at some points of radius , by substituting the density values into eq .",
    "( 4 ) and through neutrinos point - by - point evolution , then we can obtain the needed results .      in this subsection , based on the theory about the neutrino propagation in matter and applying the density profiles in section 3",
    ", we will show in detail how @xmath1 and @xmath3 change in the 8.8@xmath39 supernova models , respectively .    in fig .",
    "4 , it is shown how the survival probability of @xmath5 , @xmath1 , changes over time when the neutrino energy takes four different values .",
    "because of the time interval between the density profiles at different time points , @xmath1 changes in a broken - line manner . as we can see from fig .",
    "4 , for @xmath54 = 11 , 16 and 25 mev , the value of @xmath1 has a significant reduction from 0.2 s to 0.5 s. after 1 second , @xmath1 is changing all the time , but its changes are very small , and the value of @xmath1 is basically no more than 0.05 .",
    "while for the line of @xmath54 = 40 mev , @xmath1 has small changes before 1 s without dramatic decline , then with the increase of time its value twists and turns up to 0.2 at 6 s.    fig . 5 details",
    "how @xmath1 varies with time and the neutrino energy in a three - dimensional graph .",
    "it looks that @xmath1 changes continuously because the curves were processed by `` ployfit '' under the assumption that there is no sudden change between different time points .",
    "this method is also used in other three - dimensional graphs in the following passage .",
    "it is found that at the early stage of explosion ( @xmath55 1 s ) and when the neutrino energy is relatively small ( @xmath56 10 mev ) , the value of @xmath1 is relatively large but declines abruptly in a short time .",
    "these obvious changes form some sharp protuberances at the corner of the figure . then with the increase of time and the neutrino energy",
    ", @xmath1 goes into the next stage , in which the variations of @xmath1 are smoother compared with before .",
    "although there are many small fluctuations , the value of @xmath1 always keeps below 0.1 basically in this stage .",
    "but as the time is later than 4 s and at high neutrino energy ( @xmath57 40 mev ) , some large fluctuations appear , which means @xmath1 is greatly affected by time and the neutrino energy during this period . in parallel with the increase of time and the neutrino energy , @xmath1 is rising with fluctuations in the area of @xmath49 5 s and @xmath57 60 mev , and its value is even close to 0.5 ultimately .    at the same time",
    ", we also calculate the conversion probability of @xmath58 , @xmath3 , in the 8.8@xmath39 model . fig .",
    "6 shows the time - dependent changes of @xmath3 , where the neutrino energy is taken the same values as in fig .",
    "4 . different from @xmath1 ,",
    "the value of @xmath3 is relatively large . when @xmath44 = 0.2 s , for @xmath54 = 11 , 25 and 40 mev , @xmath3 is greater than 0.9 ; for @xmath54 = 16 mev , @xmath3 is greater than 0.75 . with time increasing from 0.2 s to 0.5 s ,",
    "the value of @xmath3 rises up to about 0.97 for all the lines of different neutrino energy . in generally , for @xmath54 = 11 , 16 , 25 mev , @xmath3 always keeps above 0.95 in spite of some small changes after 0.5 s. while for @xmath54 = 40 mev , the value of @xmath3 shows a downward trend roughly over the same time period , and decreases to about 0.82 at 6 s.    in fig .",
    "7 , it can be seen how the @xmath3 varies with time and the neutrino energy . at the beginning of explosion ( @xmath55 1 s ) and at low neutrino energy ( @xmath56 20 mev )",
    ", @xmath3 has abrupt changes so there are some `` upside - down peaks '' in the corner of this figure .",
    "then the value of @xmath3 goes up and down , and maintains between 0.8 and 1 basically .",
    "as time goes on and the neutrino energy gets bigger , in the area of @xmath59 4 s and @xmath60 50 mev , the extent of variations become more and more remarkable .    by comparing fig . 7 with fig .",
    "5 , it seems that if @xmath1 can be rotated 180 degrees with respect to the xy plane , we would obtain the figure of @xmath3 .",
    "if so , the sum of @xmath1 and @xmath3 would equal 1 , then it means the number of @xmath61 is unchangeable even neutrino oscillations exist in the supernova .",
    "if the result of @xmath1 added to @xmath3 is greater than 1 , it means the number of @xmath5 is more than that when they are emitted .",
    "otherwise , the result of less than 1 implies that the number of @xmath5 is less than the original number . in order to find whether the number of @xmath5 loses or increases",
    ", the results of @xmath1 added to @xmath3 as the function of the neutrino energy are shown in fig .",
    "8 .    because the result of 0.2 s is quite a bit different from those of other points of time ,",
    "the results are shown in two figures . in the left figure , it is found that when @xmath44 = 0.2 s , the number of @xmath5 is severely changeable with the neutrino energy , which means at the beginning of explosion , the conversion between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is very drastic . in the right figure",
    ", we can see the results are always changing but trend toward stability compared with the case of 0.2 s and keep within the range of 0.93 - 1.07 .",
    "that is , the losing and increasing ratio of @xmath5 are both no more than 7@xmath62 during 0.5 s - 6 s of explosion .      in fig .",
    "9 , there are four typical examples of @xmath1 at different neutrino energies changing with time in the 10.8@xmath39 model . it is found that the value of @xmath1 is less than 0.2 at 0.5 s for @xmath54 = 11 , 16 , 25 , 40 mev . when @xmath44 = 1 s , @xmath1 of four different neutrino energies all drop to about 0.02 and keep the value till @xmath63 . as for @xmath54 = 11 , 16",
    ", 25 mev , @xmath1 maintains its value until 10 s ; but for @xmath54 = 40 mev , at 9 s @xmath1 increases to about 0.08 and then falls back to approach the previous value before 8 s. compared with fig .",
    "4 , it seems that the time - varying fluctuations of @xmath1 in the 10.8@xmath39 model are much less than those in the 8.8@xmath39 model .",
    "the variations of @xmath1 with time and the neutrino energy in the 10.8@xmath39 model is shown by a three - dimensional graph in fig . 10 . at 0.5",
    "s , the value of @xmath1 changes significantly with the increase of the neutrino energy , so there are many fluctuations along the axis of the neutrino energy . from @xmath44",
    "= 0.5 s to @xmath44 = 1 s , @xmath1 has an abrupt decrease , which is in accord with the case shown in fig .",
    "9 . with time",
    "going on , despite the neutrino energy is different , @xmath1 goes into a relatively stable state and its value is always around zero .",
    "but in the region of @xmath49 8 s and @xmath57 40 mev , some obvious fluctuations of @xmath1 revive again , however , its value never exceeds 0.2 .",
    "overall , there is an obvious difference between the 10.8@xmath39 model and the 8.8@xmath39 model about @xmath1 .",
    "that is , @xmath1 is more stable in the 10.8@xmath39 model than in the 8.8@xmath39 model . at the same time , two models also have some similarities : at the beginning of explosion ( @xmath55 1 s ) , @xmath1 has abrupt changes in a short time and fluctuates significantly with the neutrino energy ; in the area of large neutrino energy and during the later time of explosion , fluctuations of @xmath1 become obvious and frequent .    in fig .",
    "11 , it can be seen how @xmath3 changes with time when the neutrino energy takes four different values in the 10.8@xmath39 model .",
    "obviously , for all the lines the value of @xmath3 increases from more than 0.82 of 0.5 s to about 0.98 of 1 s. afterwards , for @xmath54 = 11 , 16 mev , @xmath3 keeps invariable basically from 2 s to 9 s and decreases slightly at 10 s. on the lines of @xmath54 = 25 , 40 mev , there are relatively small drops at 3 s and relatively large drops at 9 s respectively , yet without significant changes at other points of time .",
    "the variations of @xmath3 with time and the neutrino energy in the 10.8@xmath39 model is shown in fig .",
    "similar to @xmath1 in fig .",
    "10 , at 0.5 s , @xmath3 has many fluctuations along the axis of the neutrino energy and a sudden change from 0.5 s to 1 s. when @xmath49 8 s and @xmath57 40 mev , the fluctuations of @xmath3 exist again , and its value varies between 0.8 and 1 approximately .",
    "while in other areas , @xmath3 maintains the basic stability .",
    "generally , the figure of @xmath3 in the 10.8@xmath39 model is smoother by comparison with @xmath3 of the 8.8@xmath39 model shown in fig .",
    "likewise , we also plot the results of @xmath1 added to @xmath3 to find how the number of @xmath5 changes in the 10.8@xmath39 model .",
    "same as fig .",
    "8 , there are two figures in fig",
    ". 13 . in the left figure",
    ", it can be seen that at 0.5 s , the results hover drastically around 1 with the increase of the neutrino energy , which means at this point of time , the conversion of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is very dramatic and greatly affected by the neutrino energy . by contrast , the results of other points of time are relatively stable . the right figure indicate that from 1 s to 10 s of the explosion , the sum of @xmath1 and @xmath3 fluctuates in the range of 0.96 and 1.01 . at 1",
    "s , the results exceed 1 occasionally , while from 2 s to 10 s , the results are almost under the lever of 1 , which illustrates that the number of @xmath5 is more likely to lose during this period .",
    "the losing rate and the increasing rate of @xmath5 is less than 4@xmath62 and 1@xmath62 , respectively .      in fig .",
    "14 , it is illustrated how @xmath1 changes as the function of time at four different neutrino energies in the 18@xmath39 model . in this figure",
    ", we can see that at 1 s , for the four neutrino energies , @xmath1 drops below 0.05 from its original value , and then it remains so until the end of time .    in fig .",
    "15 , it is found that @xmath1 has many prominent fluctuations at 0.5 s with the change of the neutrino energy .",
    "after 1 s , no change can be observed so the value of @xmath1 almost becomes a plane in the three - dimensional graph .",
    "this phenomenon corresponds to the straight lines from 1 s to 10 s in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is very close to 0 , meaning that @xmath5 almost completely convert into @xmath6 during this period .    in fig .",
    "16 , for the four lines of different neutrino energies , the value of @xmath3 in the 18@xmath39 model has an obvious rise at 1 s and then basically remains constant although the time is changing .",
    "the only noticeable one is a slight decline at 1 s for @xmath54 = 11 and 16 mev .    in fig .",
    "17 , it can be seen that @xmath3 changes with the neutrino energy very significantly at 0.5 s. just like fig .",
    "7 and fig .",
    "12 , there are many fluctuations on the edge of the figure . from 0.5 s to 1 s , the value of @xmath3 goes up obviously , which can be seen more clearly in fig . 16 .",
    "after the marked change , @xmath3 is nearly invariable and remains broadly flat over the rest of the region consisting of time and the neutrino energy .",
    "and the value of @xmath3 always near 1 suggests that almost all @xmath6 convert into @xmath5 after 1 second of explosion .    in the left picture of fig . 18 ,",
    "the line of 0.5 s varies with the neutrino energy remarkably .",
    "but on other lines , it is difficult to observe significant changes . in the right figure",
    ", it is shown that the variations of results at low energies ( @xmath56 30 mev ) are a little remarkable than those at high energies during the time of 1 s - 10 s. but the change interval is always between 0.975 and 1.01 .",
    "in other words , the permissible losing rate of @xmath5 is no more than 2.5@xmath62 and the increasing rate is no more that 1@xmath62 during this time .",
    "by comparing the variations of @xmath1 in three models , it is observed that at the start of explosion ( @xmath64 1 s ) , @xmath1 changes abruptly in a short time and changes significantly with the neutrino energy .",
    "later on , it remains relatively stable .",
    "but with the increase of time and the neutrino energy , fluctuations of @xmath1 start to get more and more prominent in the 8.8@xmath39 model and the 10.8@xmath39 model",
    ". meanwhile , the intensity and the scale of fluctuations in the 10.8@xmath39 model are lower and smaller than those in the 8.8@xmath39 model .",
    "nevertheless , this `` restart - fluctuating '' phenomenon does not appear in the 18@xmath39 model , in consequence the previous stable state is maintained until the end . in brief , @xmath1 is getting more stable with the increase of supernova masses in the models .",
    "similar to the variations of @xmath1 , @xmath3 in three models also have an abrupt change before 1 s and can be affected obviously by the neutrino energy at the initial stage of explosion .",
    "followed by a relatively stable phase , @xmath3 restarts to fluctuate over time and with the increase of the neutrino energy .",
    "same as the case of @xmath1 , with the increase of supernova mass in the model , the relative stable area of @xmath3 is getting bigger and bigger .    by plotting the results of @xmath1 added to @xmath3 in three models , we can analyze how the number of @xmath5 changes with the neutrino energy at different times .",
    "it turns out that the number of @xmath5 is extremely unstable at the beginning of explosion ( @xmath64 1 s ) , reflecting the dramatic conversions between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . during the next period of explosion ( 1 s",
    "- 6 s for the 8.8@xmath39 model ; 1 s - 10 s for the 10.8@xmath39 and the 18@xmath39 model ) , the number of @xmath5 has some small changes with time and the neutrino energy . generally ,",
    "if we could detect @xmath5 after one second of explosion outside the supernova , compared with the moment when @xmath5 is just emitted , the number of @xmath5 might be increasing or reduced . its change rate is no more than 7@xmath62 , 4@xmath62 and 2.5@xmath62 in the 8.8@xmath39 , 10.8@xmath39 and 18@xmath39 models , respectively .",
    "it seems that the number of @xmath5 is more stable in the more massive supernova , although the conversions between @xmath5 and @xmath6 are very drastic .    in summary ,",
    "the supernova mass in the model determines the density profiles in the supernova .",
    "consequently , it can affect the interactions between neutrinos and matter , and then make changes to @xmath1 , @xmath3 and the number of neutrinos that can be detected .",
    "so it needs to be stressed that the supernova mass is an important factor when properties of supernova neutrinos are studied .",
    "there is no doubt that if we want to obtain the number of neutrinos that can be detected on the earth , discussing the shock effects is merely not enough . in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite , we have already studied on the earth effects comprehensively and the relevant researches on the collective effects are ongoing currently @xcite-@xcite .",
    "so far , we have already known that the collective effects are very important on the conversions between different neutrinos and affect other aspects about neutrinos , such as the mass hierarchy and luminosity @xcite@xcite . with the progress of study on the impacts of shock wave effects and collective effects ,",
    "it is possible to obtain the results in good agreement with experiments .",
    "we are very grateful to tobias fisher for providing the simulation data about the density profiles of supernovae .",
