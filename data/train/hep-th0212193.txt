    "the most remarkable discovery of the last few years in theoretical particle physics is the realization that certain string theories are identical to certain field theories .",
    "more generally , a large class of gravitational theories are precisely equivalent to non - gravitational theories ; we will be interested here in the special case which is the equivalence between string theories and gauge theories .",
    "an equivalence of this type was previously suspected on general grounds from both directions :    * gauge theory to string theory * : historically , string theory originated from an attempt to describe the strong nuclear interactions , motivated by the linear confining force between quarks and anti - quarks ( as if there is a string connecting them ) and by the appearance of regge trajectories in the meson and hadron spectra .",
    "now , we know that these interactions can be described by a gauge theory ( qcd ) , but this gauge theory seems to behave ( at least qualitatively ) like a string theory at low energies , where the running gauge coupling constant is large . a more quantitative reason to expect gauge theories to be related to string theories comes from t hooft s analysis of the large @xmath2 limit of @xmath3 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "t hooft showed that if one takes @xmath4 with fixed @xmath5 , then ( in a double - line notation ) the feynman diagram expansion arranges itself according to the minimal genus @xmath6 of the surface which the diagrams can be drawn on , and every amplitude can be written in the form @xmath7 with some functions @xmath8 arising from genus @xmath6 diagrams .",
    "this is the same expansion as in a string theory whose string coupling constant is @xmath9 .",
    "the leading contribution in the large @xmath2 limit comes from `` planar diagrams '' with @xmath10 .",
    "t hooft conjectured that for large @xmath11 the feynman diagrams become dense and form smooth two dimensional surfaces which may be identified with string worldsheets .    *",
    "gravity to field theory * : string theory is a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "it was argued by t hooft and susskind ( see bousso s lectures at this school ) that the number of degrees of freedom in a theory of quantum gravity on some manifold scales as the area of the boundary of the manifold rather than as the volume of the manifold .",
    "this suggests that theories of quantum gravity may be described as non - gravitational theories living on the boundary of space - time ; in some cases this description could involve local field theories .",
    "the first explicit realization of these general expectations was the ads / cft correspondence , and we will start by briefly reviewing this correspondence .",
    "the correspondence allows us to use string theory and gravity to learn about the strong coupling limits of specific field theories , such as the @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory .",
    "the standard model includes in it qcd , which is an @xmath12 gauge theory which becomes strongly coupled at low energies , and it would be very interesting to find a good description of this theory in the regime where the original variables of qcd ( the quarks and gluons ) become strongly coupled . as discussed above , one expects such a description to involve string theory ( at least for large @xmath2 , but the stringy description could perhaps be useful even for @xmath13 ) . in these lectures",
    "we will discuss how we may be able to get such a description from generalizations of the ads / cft correspondence , in several different ways .",
    "all these ways will lead to a description of the large @xmath2 limit of a pure yang - mills theory ( sometimes with @xmath14 supersymmetry ) , but this is presumably a necessary first step towards constructing a string theory for qcd , and the theories we will discuss have the same qualitative features as qcd ( exhibiting phenomena like confinement and chiral symmetry breaking ) .",
    "we will encounter some obstacles on all the different paths towards a string theory of qcd , but the obstacles seem to be technical rather than problems of principle , so hopefully it will be possible to overcome them in the future .",
    "the first concrete example ( above two dimensions ) to be found of the general relation between large @xmath2 gauge theories and string theories is the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in general",
    "this relates a theory of quantum gravity on @xmath15 dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space ( times some compact manifold ) to a @xmath16-dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) . in the case of type iib string theory compactified on 5-dimensional ads space @xmath17 ( times a compact 5-dimensional manifold )",
    "the dual theory is usually a gauge theory .",
    "the simplest example of the ads / cft correspondence is the duality between type iib string theory compactified on @xmath18 and the @xmath0 supersymmetric four dimensional yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath3 .",
    "the parameters of string theory in this background are the string coupling constant @xmath19 and the radius of curvature @xmath20 of the @xmath17 and of the @xmath21 , measured in units of the string tension @xmath22 ; from these two parameters one can determine ( using the equations of motion ) the ( quantized ) flux of the 5-form field of type iib string theory on the @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters of the yang - mills theory are the yang - mills coupling constant @xmath23 ( which does not depend on the scale in this theory ) and the number of colors @xmath2 .",
    "the two sets of parameters are related by @xmath24 and @xmath25 these two relations imply that the flux of the 5-form field on the @xmath21 is equal to @xmath2 ( in the units in which it is quantized to be an integer ) .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence is believed to be an exact equivalence , in the sense that all observables are supposed to be equal on both sides ( when the parameters are identified according to equations ( [ relone ] ) , ( [ reltwo ] ) ) .",
    "some of the evidence for this equivalence is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "it is often said that the ads / cft correspondence is a strong / weak coupling duality ( like s - duality ) , but this is not precise since each side of the correspondence is really labeled by two parameters .",
    "as described above , at the leading order in @xmath26 we keep only planar diagrams in the field theory , and these can be described by a perturbation theory in the parameter @xmath27 ; on the other hand at leading order in @xmath19 in the string theory , we have in the string worldsheet sigma model an expansion in the space - time curvature @xmath28 . equation ( [ reltwo ] ) tells us that these two expansions are indeed related by a strong / weak coupling duality . on the other hand ,",
    "the large @xmath2 genus expansion in the field theory is governed by @xmath26 , and the string theory genus expansion is governed by @xmath19 , and equation ( [ relone ] ) tells us that for fixed @xmath11 these two expansions are actually the same .",
    "thus , if we could somehow perform exact computations in @xmath11 in the field theory , or in @xmath29 in the string theory , then the ads / cft correspondence would turn into a perturbative duality where we could compare results from both sides order by order in @xmath19 ( or in @xmath26 ) .",
    "an example of this was recently found in the plane - wave limit of @xmath18 @xcite , where the string theory worldsheet sigma model is exactly solvable @xcite .",
    "the matching of all observables related to local operators can be formulated via the equivalence of the partition function of the conformal field theory with the partition function of string theory .",
    "we use the metric @xmath30 for ads space coordinates , or a poincar patch of the lorentzian ads space if we choose a lorentzian signature for the @xmath31 coordinates . ] , in which the boundary of the space , spanned by the @xmath31 coordinates , is at @xmath32 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath33 the gauge - invariant local operators in the cft , with scaling dimension @xmath34 , and by @xmath35 the corresponding string theory fields in ads space , whose mass is related to the operator dimensions by @xmath36 then we can write the equivalence as @xmath37 \\equiv \\langle e^{i \\int d^4x \\lambda_i(x ) { \\cal",
    "o}_i(x ) } \\rangle_{cft } = z_{iib}[\\lim_{z \\to 0}(\\chi_i(x , z ) z^{\\delta_i-4 } ) =   \\lambda_i(x)].\\ ] ] here we introduced arbitrary sources @xmath38 for every operator , and on the right - hand side we have the string theory partition function with particular boundary conditions on the boundary of ads space .",
    "the correlation functions of local operators in the theory are given by derivatives of this expression with respect to @xmath38 ( at @xmath39 ) .",
    "in fact , the relation ( [ equivalence ] ) only holds for a particular class of operators called `` single - trace operators '' , which in the gauge theory may be written as a trace of a product of adjoint representation fields ; the generalization of this formula to include also `` multiple - trace operators '' which can not be written in this way is discussed in @xcite and is less well - understood on the string theory side .",
    "a particular interesting class of operators in the @xmath0 sym theory includes the chiral primary operators , which are in short representations of the @xmath0 superconformal algebra such that their dimensions can not receive any quantum corrections .",
    "some of these are mapped to type iib supergravity fields , and for large field theory coupling @xmath11 we can compute their correlation functions on the right - hand side of ( [ equivalence ] ) in the supergravity approximation ( since @xmath40 is small ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the boundary conditions corresponding to putting in delta - function sources for the fields ( as we usually do in computing correlation functions ) are imposed by bulk - to - boundary propagators in the supergravity computation . more generally , we have in the string theory ( at least at weak string coupling ) a vertex operator @xmath41 for each single - trace operator @xmath33 ( where @xmath42 is a coordinate on the string worldsheet ) , and we can identify @xmath33 with @xmath43 in the sense that inserting the former into the field theory path integral is the same as inserting the latter into the string theory path integral . in this way we can map all single - trace local observables between the two sides of the correspondence .",
    "this mapping of operators is precisely known only for the chiral primary operators ( and for some related states with large r - charges , as described in minwalla s lectures ) . denoting the field content of the @xmath0 sym theory by @xmath44 for the gauge field , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) for the fermions and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) for the scalar fields ( all these fields are in the adjoint representation of @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the chiral primary operators of the @xmath0 superconformal algebra are given by @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) where the @xmath51 indices @xmath52 are contracted in a symmetric traceless manner .",
    "all other single - trace chiral operators in the theory are descendants of these ( they can be obtained from the operators above by acting on them with the supercharges of the theory ) , and their spectrum agrees precisely ( for @xmath53 ) with that of the single - particle states of type iib supergravity compactified on @xmath18 .",
    "this precise matching means that all other operators in the sym theory must be matched to other fields of type iib string theory which are not type iib supergravity fields .",
    "all these fields have a mass at least of the order of the string scale . using ( [ massdim ] ) and ( [ reltwo ] ) this means that the dimension of the corresponding operators grows at least as fast as @xmath54 in the limit of large @xmath2 and large @xmath55 .",
    "many tests and generalizations of the correspondence have been made in the last five years , which i will not go into here  some of them are described in @xcite ( where more details of the correspondence may also be found ) .",
    "as described above , the ads / cft correspondence allows us ( among other things ) to learn about the strong coupling behavior of the @xmath56 sym theory ( for instance , to compute the anomalous dimensions of certain operators in the strong coupling limit ) from type iib string theory ( or supergravity ) .",
    "this field theory is quite different from qcd  in particular it is scale - invariant ( both classically and quantum mechanically ) , while qcd is weakly coupled at high energies but strongly coupled at low energies . for describing nature it would be more interesting to understand various strong coupling properties of qcd , such as confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , the formation of a mass gap , the spectrum of bound states like mesons and baryons , and so on .",
    "all these properties are strong coupling effects that can not be computed in qcd perturbation theory .",
    "however , as described in the introduction above , there is no reason why it should nt be possible to learn about these properties by using a dual string theory ( with weak string coupling in the large @xmath2 limit ) , analogous to the one appearing in the ads / cft correspondence reviewed in the previous section .    in the previous section",
    "we saw that the string theory dual of the @xmath0 sym theory had a limit where it was well approximated by supergravity . on the other hand , a string theory background describing qcd ( or pure yang - mills theory )",
    "must be strongly curved .",
    "one argument for this is that asymptotically free theories like qcd are weakly coupled at high energy scales ( compared to some characteristic scale @xmath57 ) , and we saw above that weak coupling tends to be related to large curvatures ; in particular it is hard to imagine how we could reproduce perturbative qcd amplitudes at high energies from a supergravity theory .",
    "a more general argument is that the spectrum of qcd - like theories , including gauge - invariant particles like mesons and glueballs , comes ( approximately ) in regge trajectories ( recall that this was one of the original reasons to suspect that they are related to string theories ) .",
    "the regge trajectory including particles of spin @xmath58 starts at a mass of order @xmath59 . on the other hand ,",
    "a weakly curved superstring theory background has a supergravity approximation at low energies , and supergravity theories include only particles of spin less than or equal to 2 , so in such theories there is a large mass gap between the spectrum of particles with @xmath60 and with @xmath61 ( the low - energy theory is generally a ten dimensional supergravity theory , which gives rise via a kaluza - klein reduction to many particles of spin 2 or lower in four dimensions ) .",
    "thus , it seems that to approach qcd we will eventually need to understand string theory in highly curved backgrounds  this has been one of the main obstacles to formulating a string theory of qcd . as described above , the coupling between strings is not an obstacle , since in the large @xmath2 limit we expect to find a dual string theory with a string coupling constant of order @xmath9 ( but this could also become a problem when we eventually take @xmath13 ) .",
    "unfortunately , progress in studying strongly curved backgrounds in string theory has been rather slow ( except for some special cases , like wzw models , which are well understood ) .",
    "thus , so far almost all computations in string theory duals to qcd - like theories have been done in supergravity approximations . as described above",
    ", such approximations will never be quantitatively similar to qcd .",
    "however , they can be qualitatively similar to qcd , and can exhibit similar properties like confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "as we will see , they could even be continuously related to theories like pure yang - mills theory by changing parameters  for some range of parameters of the theory we could have a good supergravity approximation ( and have a large ratio between @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) while in a different range of parameters the same theory could go over to pure yang - mills theory ( with a small ratio between @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study such `` toy models of qcd '' even if we do not currently know how to control their behavior in the regime where they approach qcd , and this will be the main subject of these lecture notes .    above we described the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence for the case of the @xmath0 sym theory . in order to approach qcd",
    "we want to find string theory duals for non - conformal theories which have less ( or no ) supersymmetry .",
    "there are three general ways that have been used so far to obtain such theories from the ads / cft correspondence :    * \\(i ) we can start from a conformal theory ( with a known string theory dual ) and deform it by a relevant or marginal operator which breaks conformal invariance and supersymmetry . *",
    "\\(ii ) we can start from a higher dimensional theory ( again with a known string theory dual ) and compactify it to four dimensions in a way which ( partially ) breaks supersymmetry . *",
    "\\(iii ) we can try to directly find the dual of non - conformal four dimensional field theories .",
    "the last method leads to `` duality cascades '' , and it is described in klebanov s talks in this school . in these talks",
    "i will focus on the first two methods in sections ( [ deform ] ) and ( [ compactification ] ) , respectively , and briefly discuss the third method in section ( [ klestrass ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath0 sym theory provides the simplest example of the ads / cft correspondence , the simplest way to use the first method is to study deformations of this theory .",
    "the @xmath0 theory includes four massless adjoint fermions @xmath45 and six massless adjoint scalars @xmath47 , and we would like to get rid of them in order to remain with the pure yang - mills theory . as mentioned above",
    ", this theory is already quite similar to qcd . adding a small number of quark flavors is not expected to significantly change the large @xmath2 limit of the theory , but it adds some complications , so we will be content here with finding a dual for pure yang - mills theory .",
    "so , we would like to deform the @xmath0 theory by mass terms for the `` extra '' fields , doing something like @xmath64 the problem with this deformation is that the first term we wrote down , @xmath65 , is not a chiral operator ( it is the `` trace '' part of @xmath66 , and it sits in the so - called konishi multiplet ) .",
    "this not only means that we can not study it using supergravity ( since it is not in the supergravity spectrum , which includes only chiral operators ) , but also that for large @xmath55 this operator acquires a large anomalous dimension ( as described above ) , and the deformation by this operator becomes irrelevant ( so it does not make sense as a quantum field theory ) .",
    "we can write down chiral scalar mass operators of the form @xmath67 with traceless @xmath68 , but then the sum of the eigenvalues of @xmath68 must vanish , so some of the eigenvalues must be negative , leading to instabilities and to a breaking of the gauge symmetry ( which we do not desire ) .",
    "thus , the only mass deformation which makes sense as a leading deformation is of the form @xmath69 .",
    "the mass matrix can always be diagonalized so we can generally write this as @xmath70 this involves chiral operators @xmath71 ( arising from the action of two supercharges on the chiral primary operator @xmath72 ) , of ( protected ) scaling dimension @xmath73 , so we can study this deformation ( at least in principle ) in the supergravity approximation .",
    "we expect that when we perform such a deformation scalar masses will be induced quantum mechanically ( by loop corrections , by operator mixings or by rg flow ) at order @xmath74 , and we could also turn on tree - level scalar masses of order @xmath74 proportional to the chiral scalar mass operator .",
    "but , we should still require that the masses squared of all the scalars are positive so that we have a theory which does not spontaneously break the gauge symmetry .    one way to ensure this stability property is to retain some of the supersymmetry of the original theory .",
    "this requires that one of the fermions must remain massless , @xmath75 , so that it can be in the same supersymmetry multiplet as the gauge field . if @xmath75 we can always choose the second order scalar masses such that the theory preserves supersymmetry , and then we can describe the deformation by a superpotential ( in @xmath14 superspace notation ) . in @xmath14 language",
    "the @xmath0 theory includes one vector multiplet and three chiral multiplets @xmath76 in the adjoint representation , and we can describe the theory after the mass deformation by the superpotential @xmath77 + m_1 \\phi_1 ^ 2 + m_2 \\phi_2 ^ 2 + m_3 \\phi_3 ^ 2).\\ ] ] at leading order in the deformation this is exactly the fermion mass term we wrote above ( with @xmath75 , where we normalize the kinetic terms of all the fields to be proportional to @xmath78 ) , and at second order the theory with the superpotential ( [ massdeform ] ) includes particular scalar mass terms which ensure that an @xmath79 subgroup of the original @xmath0 supersymmetry remains unbroken .",
    "this ensures that even after we take quantum corrections into account , the scalar masses squared will always be non - negative .",
    "if we do not preserve supersymmetry this may or may not happen .",
    "one simple possibility is to give a supersymmetry - preserving mass only to a single chiral multiplet by taking only @xmath80 to be non - zero . in this case",
    "the mass deformation is believed to lead at low energies to a strongly coupled superconformal field theory @xcite with a superpotential of the form @xmath81 ^ 2)$ ] ( obtained by integrating out @xmath82 in ( [ massdeform ] ) ) .",
    "the supergravity dual of this theory is known ( though the solution describing the full mass deformation has only been computed numerically and not explicitly @xcite ) , and @xmath83 is an exactly marginal operator in the low - energy conformal theory which maps to the dilaton in its string theory dual in the string theory does not lead to a weakly coupled theory on the field theory side of the duality . ] .",
    "if we turn on only two fermion masses ( one way to do this is to choose @xmath84 , in which case the deformation actually preserves @xmath85 supersymmetry ) we find at low energies a theory with a coulomb branch along which a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for @xmath86 breaks the gauge symmetry to @xmath87 .",
    "the supergravity dual of this deformation is known at some special points in its moduli space ( called `` enhanon points '' ) @xcite . both for one non - zero mass and for two",
    "non - zero masses the low - energy behavior is very different from that of qcd so we will not discuss it here .",
    "the interesting case for us will be the case where all three of the supersymmetry - preserving masses are non - zero .",
    "naively this gives a mass to all the fields except for the @xmath14 vector multiplet , so for energies @xmath88 we expect to remain with the pure @xmath79 sym theory .",
    "this theory is quite similar to qcd  it also confines , exhibits a mass gap of the order of a strong coupling scale @xmath89 and chiral symmetry breaking , and so on .",
    "unfortunately , this naive expectation is not always realized .",
    "we can easily compute the characteristic scale @xmath89 of this `` low - energy '' sym theory , defined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the renormalization scale and @xmath92 is the one - loop beta function , by matching the running coupling constant at the mass scales of the chiral multiplets .",
    "we find @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the gauge coupling constant of the high - energy @xmath0 sym theory .",
    "this means that for large @xmath55 , where we might expect to have a dual supergravity description ( at least we know that we have one for energies above the mass scales ) , @xmath89 is of the same order as the @xmath95 , so there is no separation of scales between the fields @xmath76 that we are trying to get rid of and the states of the `` low - energy '' @xmath14 sym theory , since the lowest mass states of this theory are expected to have masses of order @xmath89 . in order to get such a separation",
    "we must take @xmath96 .",
    "this leads to @xmath97 , but then we do not have a good supergravity approximation and we must deal with a strongly curved string theory background .",
    "this is in agreement with our general discussion in the previous section .",
    "when all three masses are non - zero it turns out that the theory has many discrete supersymmetric vacua .",
    "classically the vacua are given , as in any other supersymmetric gauge theory , by solving the f - term equations @xmath98 and dividing the space of solutions by the complexified gauge group , which in our case is @xmath99 ( this ensures that the d - term equations are also satisfied ) . taking all the masses to be equal for simplicity (",
    "the generalization to arbitrary masses is straightforward ) , the f - term equations are @xmath100 = -{m\\over \\sqrt{2 } } \\epsilon_{ijk } \\phi_k.\\ ] ] since this is the defining equation for a representation of the @xmath101 lie algebra ( up to a rescaling of the @xmath76 s ) , this is solved by any three matrices which are an @xmath2-dimensional representation of @xmath101 .",
    "any such representation is a sum of irreducible representations of dimensions @xmath102 , and we can write the classical solutions for the matrices @xmath76 in a block - diagonal form involving blocks of size @xmath103 ( with @xmath104 )",
    ". only three of the six real matrices @xmath47 are non - zero in these vacua , and the choice of which three is determined by the phase of the mass @xmath105 .",
    "in most of these vacua the gauge group is not completely broken , so classically there is no mass gap .",
    "the only vacuum where the gauge group is completely broken classically is the one corresponding to the @xmath2-dimensional representation of @xmath101 , which is called the `` higgs vacuum '' .",
    "the opposite case is when we have @xmath2 copies of the @xmath106-dimensional representation of @xmath101 , and then @xmath107 .",
    "classically this leaves the full @xmath3 group unbroken .",
    "quantum mechanically we expect in this vacuum to get at low energies a behavior like that of the pure @xmath14 sym theory ( as described above , this expectation is valid for small @xmath55 ) , which confines ( so this is called the `` confining vacuum '' ) and has @xmath2 different vacua ( differentiated by the `` gluino condensate '' @xmath108 ) .",
    "an intermediate case is the vacuum corresponding to @xmath109 copies of the @xmath110-dimensional representation of @xmath101 ( with @xmath111 ) .",
    "classically in such a vacuum the gauge group is broken to @xmath112 , and the low - energy gauge theory is the @xmath14 sym theory with gauge group @xmath112 , so quantum mechanically we expect this vacuum to have a mass gap and split into @xmath109 discrete vacua @xcite .",
    "all other vacua , involving irreducible representations of different dimensions , have classically unbroken @xmath113 gauge groups , so we expect that they will not have a mass gap even in the quantum theory ( since the @xmath113 vector multiplets , which are free at low energies , are expected to remain massless ) .    in field theory , much is known about the behavior of this theory in its different vacua .",
    "for example , one can exactly compute the vacuum expectation values of various chiral operators like @xmath114 and @xmath115 @xcite . in the non - supersymmetric case",
    "we expect to get a similar qualitative behavior of the theory ( if the deformation is stable ) , except that the degeneracy between the different vacua is expected to be lifted ( it is not clear whether the `` confining vacua '' , which are related to the pure yang - mills theory , are the ones with the lowest vacuum energy ) .      what is the string theory dual of the mass - deformed field theory in all the different vacua described above ? in order to compute the correlation functions of the @xmath0 sym theory one uses the relation ( [ equivalence ] ) only for infinitesimal @xmath38 . however , this relation is valid also for finite @xmath38 .",
    "thus , deformations of the @xmath0 sym theory by @xmath116 correspond to solutions of string theory with an asymptotically ads background in which @xmath117 , or equivalently by adding to the worldsheet action a term of the form @xmath118 ( instead of just inserting this combination into correlation functions ) .",
    "we are interested in lorentz - invariant deformations for which @xmath38 is independent of @xmath119 .    in the supergravity approximation , in order to describe a particular deformation we need to find a solution to type iib supergravity with the appropriate boundary conditions . for supersymmetric solutions ( which we are mainly interested in here ) this can actually be done by solving only first order equations ( second order equations are generally needed for non - supersymmetric solutions ) . when we decompose the ten dimensional type iib supergravity multiplet on @xmath120 into multiplets of five dimensional @xmath121 supergravity , the field @xmath122 appearing in the mass deformation belongs to the lowest multiplet , which is the five dimensional graviton multiplet ( containing also the massless graviton ) .",
    "it is believed that in order to find solutions involving the fields in this multiplet one can first solve the five dimensional supergravity equations of motion and then lift the solution to ten dimensions ( this is called `` consistent truncation '' ) , and solving these equations is not very difficult .",
    "however , it turns out @xcite that doing this leads to a family of singular solutions ( which become singular at the interior of ads space ) , parameterized by different ( continuous ) values for @xmath123 ( where @xmath83 is the adjoint fermion which classically remains massless ) , while from the field theory discussion above we expect to find a discrete family of solutions , with particular known values for @xmath108 in each discrete vacuum .",
    "how can we resolve this mismatch ?",
    "since we find singular solutions it is clear that the supergravity approximation breaks down , so we have to go beyond this approximation .",
    "some hints for how we should go beyond supergravity are provided by the following facts :    * \\(i ) the supergravity field @xmath122 corresponding to the mass operator @xmath124 , which gets a vacuum expectation value when we perform the mass deformation , is a particular linear combination of the components of the ns - ns and r - r 2-form fields with indices in the @xmath21 . for small values of @xmath125 ( near the boundary ) this expectation value grows as @xmath126 as we move into the interior of ads space , suggesting that in order to desingularize the solution we may need to insert a source for these 2-form fields ( though the total charge of the 3-form field strengths vanishes , so there is no necessity for doing this ) .",
    "such a source would be a d5-brane or an ns5-brane wrapped on an @xmath1 inside the @xmath21 , filling the four dimensional space @xmath127 which the gauge theory lives on , and localized in the radial coordinate @xmath125 .",
    "* \\(ii ) in the `` higgs vacuum '' the gauge group is completely broken classically , and ( at weak coupling ) we can choose this breaking to occur at a scale much larger than the strong coupling scale @xmath89 of the theory , so we expect quantum corrections in this vacuum to be small .",
    "this vacuum corresponds to the vevs of the @xmath76 being given by the @xmath2-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath101 . in this representation",
    "we have @xmath128 ( as a matrix equation , with the identity matrix implied on the right - hand side ) , so it looks like the eigenvalues of the vevs of the @xmath76 sit on a sphere in the moduli space with radius @xmath129 ( recall that only three of the six real fields @xmath47 are non - vanishing , so this is an @xmath1 and not an @xmath21 ) . for large @xmath2",
    "the eigenvalues almost completely cover this sphere , though it should be noted that since the @xmath76 do not commute this geometrical description is slightly naive ( the vacuum expectation values really sit on a `` fuzzy sphere '' and not on a sphere ) .",
    "now , if we think of the @xmath76 s as corresponding to the positions of d3-branes ( which is how they started life in the `` derivation '' of the ads / cft correspondence before we took the near - horizon limit ) , then such vacuum expectation values correspond to a configuration where the @xmath2 d3-branes are blown up into a spherical d5-brane ( this is often called `` myers dielectric effect '' @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests again that ( at least ) the `` higgs vacuum '' could be related to a spherical d5-brane wrapped on an @xmath1 inside the @xmath21 .",
    "the arguments above motivate looking for solutions which are not just described by supergravity but which involve also 5-branes wrapped on 2-spheres inside the @xmath21 .",
    "polchinski and strassler @xcite found that non - singular solutions of this type indeed exist with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the solutions are not known explicitly , but their form is known asymptotically near the boundary of ads and near the 5-branes , and the 5-branes are stable in these backgrounds ( and even exhibit a classical mass gap if there is only a single 5-brane ) even though topologically they could collapse to a point since they carry no total 5-brane charge .",
    "it is believed that these asymptotic solutions can be pieced together into non - singular backgrounds of supergravity including 5-branes ( which may be viewed as specific sources for the supergravity fields ) .",
    "i will not describe here the details of these solutions .",
    "a special case of the polchinski - strassler solutions involves a single d5-brane , so it is natural to identify it with the `` higgs vacuum '' of the gauge theory following the discussion above .",
    "this d5-brane carries @xmath2 units of gauge field flux on the @xmath1 , @xmath130 , which implies ( using the @xmath131 coupling in the wess - zumino term of the d5-brane action ) that it carries @xmath2 units of d3-brane charge .",
    "thus , one might say ( motivated by the discussion above ) that the original @xmath2 d3-branes have blown up into a d5-brane in this configuration , though this is somewhat misleading since the d3-branes were not there in @xmath18 before we did the deformation .",
    "the d5-brane sits at some particular value of @xmath132 where it is stable ( @xmath132 is proportional to @xmath133 ) , and since it carries @xmath2 units of charge of the r - r 5-form field @xmath134 , this means that the total 3-brane charge @xmath135 , which equals @xmath2 near the boundary of ads , decreases as we increase @xmath125 . for @xmath136",
    "there is no longer any 5-form flux , and the solution in fact goes over to flat space there .",
    "so , this solution interpolates between @xmath18 for small @xmath125 and @xmath137 for large @xmath125 ( with a 5-brane in the middle ) .",
    "similar solutions were found to exist also with @xmath109 d5-branes , each of which carries @xmath110 units of d3-brane charge ( with @xmath111 ) and sitting at @xmath138 .",
    "it is natural to identify these with the vacua of the gauge theory in which the gauge symmetry is classically broken to @xmath112  in fact we can explicitly see this @xmath112 as the classical gauge symmetry on the ( overlapping ) d5-branes .",
    "both in the field theory and in the string theory this @xmath112 gauge group is expected to confine , and each such vacuum is expected to split into @xmath109 distinct vacua , but this is not visible in the classical string theory .",
    "the solutions described above are weakly coupled everywhere if we have @xmath139 , and they are weakly curved far away from the d5-branes for @xmath140 ( the regions near the d5-branes can be described well by open+closed string theory as usual ) .",
    "if we continue the logic of the previous paragraph , we would find that the @xmath141 `` confining '' vacuum should be described by @xmath2 coincident d5-branes .",
    "however , such a collection of d5-branes would have a large back - reaction on the background ( since @xmath142 is assumed to be large ) and lead to large curvatures , so we can not use supergravity to analyze it or even to check if such a solution exists or not .",
    "luckily , by using s - duality we can find a different description of the same vacuum ( more precisely , of one of the @xmath2 vacua coming from the classical @xmath143 vacuum ) . from a direct field theory analysis",
    "one can argue that the @xmath144 s - duality symmetry of the @xmath0 sym theory permutes the different vacua , and in particular the s - duality transformation @xmath145 ( for zero theta angle ) exchanges the `` higgs vacuum '' ( where the @xmath76 which are electrically charged degrees of freedom condense , so we expect magnetically charged degrees of freedom to confine as in the meissner effect in superconductors ) with one of the `` confining '' @xmath146 vacua ( where we expect the electrically charged particles to be confined , and magnetically charged particles to condense ) @xcite .",
    "so , we can try to describe the @xmath146 vacuum by performing an s - duality transformation on the solution that we found for the `` higgs vacuum '' .",
    "recall that the ads / cft correspondence maps the electric - magnetic s - duality of the @xmath0 sym theory to the s - duality of the type iib string theory .",
    "the s - duality transformation of the `` higgs vacuum '' gives a background with a single ns5-brane and no d5-branes , and it turns out that such a solution indeed exists and gives a good description for the `` confining vacuum '' , in which ( for large @xmath2 and @xmath142 ) supergravity and string perturbation theory are good approximations except in the vicinity of the ns5-brane .",
    "similarly , other 5-brane configurations can be found to describe all the other vacua of the mass - deformed theory . whenever we find more than one possible description for a vacuum ( as we found above for the `` confining vacuum '' )",
    ", they do not have an overlapping range of validity , so at most one solution can be trusted for describing a particular vacuum at a particular value of the coupling constant .",
    "the description of the various vacua in terms of branes wrapping @xmath1 s was recently confirmed directly in the field theory by dorey and sinkovics in @xcite .",
    "they computed the vacuum expectation values of the chiral operators @xmath114 in the various vacua at large @xmath55 ( this is possible since exact expressions are known for the vevs of chiral operators in the mass - deformed sym theory ) , extracted from them the distributions of the eigenvalues of the @xmath76 matrices , and showed that indeed they lie on spheres in the range of parameters where we have solutions in which the 5-form charge is carried by 5-branes wrapping spheres .",
    "while the field theory analysis we made relied strongly on supersymmetry , the construction of the solutions described above does not depend on supersymmetry , and one can find qualitatively similar solutions also in some non - supersymmetric cases , when all four fermion masses are non - zero .",
    "at least when the supersymmetry - breaking mass is small , one can argue that these solutions are still stable , since the original supersymmetric solutions had a mass gap ( see below ) , and adding a small additional mass deformation can not destabilize the background when the new mass is much smaller than the mass gap .",
    "of course , supersymmetry breaking generically removes the degeneracy between the different vacua , so we expect that most of the solutions of @xcite should be meta - stable ( classically stable but quantum mechanically unstable ) after a small supersymmetry breaking deformation , and one of them should be stable .",
    "as we discussed above , the regime where the solution of @xcite is well - described by supergravity is quite different from the regime where it is equivalent ( at low energies ) to a pure @xmath14 sym theory .",
    "however , the two regimes are continuously related ( by changing @xmath19 ) so one expects to find the same qualitative properties in this background as one has in sym , and this is indeed the case .",
    "first , it is believed that the sym theory dynamically generates a mass gap of the order of the qcd scale @xmath89 .",
    "one can show that the background of @xcite also has a mass gap .",
    "for the bulk fields this requires solving their equations of motion ( in the presence of the 5-branes ) , looking for non - singular solutions whose dependence on the @xmath127 directions is of the form @xmath147 , and showing that the spectrum of the @xmath148 dimensional @xmath149 is strictly positive ",
    "one can argue that this is indeed the case in the solution of @xcite even without knowing the explicit solution .",
    "similarly , one has to solve the equations of motion for the fields living on the branes and show that they also have a mass gap . in the background with @xmath109",
    "overlapping 5-branes we classically have a @xmath150 gauge theory in @xmath151 dimensions living on the 5-branes , compactified on @xmath152 .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath113 factor is actually unphysical ( it can be gauged away ; when there is more than one group of overlapping 5-branes only the sum of their @xmath113 fields may be gauged away ) , so one is left with an @xmath112 gauge theory , and one can show that the classical massless spectrum on the 5-branes is that of a @xmath148 dimensional @xmath14 super yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath112 . in particular , for the `` confining vacuum '' and the `` higgs vacuum '' where @xmath153 there are already classically no massless fields on the 5-branes , so the full background has a mass gap . for the vacua with @xmath154",
    "we expect that quantum effects on the 5-branes will generate a mass gap for the @xmath112 gauge theory just like they do on the gauge theory side of the correspondence , so we will have a mass gap also in this case but it is not directly visible in the supergravity ( plus 5-branes ) approximation . in vacua with more than one group of overlapping 5-branes",
    "some @xmath113 gauge multiplets remain massless , and these configurations correspond to the vacua without a mass gap in the field theory .",
    "another qualitative property of the quantum sym theory is confinement of fields charged ( electrically ) under the gauge group , which is expected to be related to condensation and screening of magnetically charged particles .",
    "as discussed above , we expect to see this property in the `` confining vacua '' , while we expect to see screening of electrically charged particles in the `` higgs vacuum '' .",
    "this property is usually tested by putting in an external quark - anti - quark pair and computing the force between them ( or , equivalently , the wilson loop operator ) .",
    "it is easy to see that in the `` higgs vacuum '' one indeed gets screening .",
    "external electrically charged particles are described by fundamental strings ending on the boundary of ( asymptotically ) ads space @xcite , and these strings can end on the d5-brane , so the force between charges at different positions in @xmath127 decays at least like the force between charged particles in a @xmath148 dimensional @xmath113 gauge theory . on the other hand , in the `` confining vacuum ''",
    "whose description involves an ns5-brane , the string can not end anywhere , but must stretch between the external particles , so the potential energy turns out to be proportional to the distance between the external particles as expected for confinement . for magnetically charged sources , which are described by d - strings ending on the boundary , the situation is the opposite , as expected from general considerations .",
    "the behavior in other vacua is also as expected @xcite .",
    "other qcd - like properties of the solution of @xcite were also analyzed , such as the existence of a baryon vertex , instantons , condensates analogous to the gluino condensate of the pure sym theory , etc .",
    "let us end this section by summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of this solution as a string theory for qcd . in the limit @xmath155 the solution provides ( at energies much smaller than @xmath105 ) a string theory for pure sym theory ( or , when we turn on supersymmetry - breaking masses , for pure ym theory ) , as desired . as expected from general considerations ,",
    "this limit involves large curvatures . in the case of",
    "@xcite it also involves a rather complicated sigma model , including rr fields , whose form is not known exactly even in the supergravity approximation .",
    "moreover , in the case of the `` confining vacuum '' ( which is most closely related to the pure sym theory ) the solution involves ns5-branes , which are not under control in perturbative string theory .",
    "so , while these solutions provide implicit string theories for pure sym theory , it seems very difficult to analyze them in the limit which is interesting for qcd .",
    "on the plus side , the construction of @xcite easily generalizes to the non - supersymmetric case , so if one understands the supersymmetric case ( and uses it to construct a string theory for pure sym theory ) it should be possible to easily find also a string theory for the ( phenomenologically more interesting ) pure yang - mills theory .",
    "two main compactification scenarios have been extensively discussed in the literature ( though many others are also possible ) .",
    "both of them start from maximally supersymmetric configurations , such that only the compactification breaks supersymmetry to four dimensional @xmath14 or @xmath156 supersymmetry .",
    "the first scenario @xcite involves the six dimensional conformal field theory , arising as the low - energy limit on m5-branes , compactified on @xmath157 , such that the fermions have anti - periodic boundary conditions around one of the circles . in an appropriate decoupling limit",
    "this gives the pure non - supersymmetric @xmath148 dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "the second scenario @xcite involves the `` little string theory '' , coming from the decoupling limit of type iib ns5-branes , compactified on an @xmath1 inside a calabi - yau manifold . in an appropriate decoupling limit",
    "this gives the @xmath148 dimensional @xmath14 sym theory .",
    "we will focus on the second scenario here , because it has the advantage ( which we did not have in the previous section ) of having a limit where it is weakly coupled and weakly curved everywhere ( with no branes ) , and it does not involve any ramond - ramond fields , so in this limit this scenario is amenable to standard string theory computations .",
    "however , a disadvantage of this scenario is that the high - energy theory is much more complicated than in the previous section ( where it was just the @xmath0 sym theory ) .",
    "let us begin by reviewing the decoupling limit of ns5-branes in general , before they are compactified .",
    "since in type iib string theory ns5-branes are s - dual to d5-branes , their decoupling limit should be the same .",
    "in general , to obtain a decoupled theory on d - branes we need to take the planck length @xmath158 to zero so as to remove the gravitational interactions with the bulk modes , but we want to keep the brane yang - mills coupling constant @xmath23 fixed so as to remain with a non - trivial theory on the brane . recall that @xmath159 , and that for dp - branes @xmath160 .",
    "thus , for @xmath161 the decoupling limit takes @xmath162 and keeps @xmath19 constant , for @xmath163 we need to take both @xmath19 and @xmath29 to zero while keeping @xmath23 constant , while for @xmath164 we need to take @xmath19 to infinity and @xmath29 to zero , again keeping @xmath23 constant ( there is no decoupling limit for @xmath165 ) .",
    "since we are taking @xmath19 to be very large we can not trust the original string theory description , but in the type iib case we can use an s - dual description ; note that s - duality does not change @xmath158 and @xmath23 ( which are physically measurable by low - energy interactions ) . after the s - duality we find for @xmath166 that the same decoupling limit can be described by starting with @xmath2 ns5-branes in type iib string theory and taking @xmath167 while keeping @xmath29 constant ( in this s - dual description ; note that on ns5-branes @xmath168 ) .",
    "this limit @xcite is called a `` little string theory '' ( lst ) since it involves a string tension parameter @xmath29 which is kept constant in the decoupling limit but it does not involve a massless graviton ; see @xcite for a review of these theories .",
    "the resulting decoupled theories are not local field theories . for instance",
    ", they have ( at high energies ) a hagedorn - like density of states , @xmath169 , as in free string theories , they have a continuous spectrum of single - particle states ( above a mass gap @xmath170 ) , and when compactified on circles they have a t - duality symmetry .",
    "all these properties are most easily seen from the holographic dual of the `` little string theories '' @xcite .",
    "this is just the near - horizon limit of the string theory background of @xmath2 ns5-branes @xcite .",
    "the metric of this near - horizon limit in the string frame is simply @xmath171 and there is also a linear dilaton in the @xmath172 direction , @xmath173 , and @xmath2 units of ns - ns 3-form flux on the @xmath174 ( such that the sigma model on the @xmath174 is simply the @xmath101 wess - zumino - witten model at level @xmath2 ) .    from the s - duality to d5-branes",
    "it is clear that at low energies the `` little string theory '' reduces to a @xmath151 dimensional sym theory ( with @xmath175 supersymmetry ) with gauge group @xmath3 and with coupling constant @xmath176 .",
    "this theory is not renormalizable so it requires some high - energy completion , which is provided by the lst .",
    "the holographic description is problematic because the string coupling diverges as we take @xmath177 .",
    "it is not surprising that the holographic description is not under full control , since the low - energy theory ( at energies below @xmath178 ) is weakly coupled , and it is hard to imagine how weakly coupled sym computations could emerge from a simple string theory background .",
    "this problem will be less severe after we compactify ( there are also ways to get around it in six dimensions ) .",
    "next , we want to reduce the `` little string theory '' to a @xmath148 dimensional field theory . compactifying on a torus @xmath179 would give at low energies an @xmath0 theory in @xmath148 dimensions , so in order to reduce the amount of supersymmetry we need to compactify on an @xmath1 ; when we compactify ns5-branes on a 2-cycle with this topology which is embedded inside a calabi - yau manifold the configuration preserves precisely @xmath148 dimensional @xmath14 supersymmetry . at low energies",
    "we find the @xmath151 dimensional sym theory compactified on an @xmath1 , with a particular embedding of the spin connection of the @xmath1 inside the @xmath180 r - symmetry of the @xmath151 dimensional sym theory ( which follows from the way that the @xmath1 is embedded in the calabi - yau manifold ) .",
    "this turns out to give a mass of the order of the inverse radius of the @xmath1 to the four scalar fields in the @xmath151 dimensional vector multiplets , and to most of the fermionic fields as well .",
    "classically , the only remaining massless degrees of freedom are those of a @xmath148 dimensional @xmath14 sym theory ( namely , @xmath3 gauge fields and a fermion field in the adjoint representation ) .",
    "there are two scales where additional degrees of freedom appear .",
    "one is the scale @xmath181 which comes from the kaluza - klein reduction on the @xmath1 , and the other is the scale @xmath182 where additional degrees of freedom of the lst become important ( beyond its massless modes discussed above ) .    by the usual matching of coupling constants ,",
    "the four dimensional coupling constant at the scale @xmath183 is @xmath184 . below this scale",
    "we can use the running coupling of the @xmath14 sym theory , and we find that the strong coupling scale of the theory is given by @xmath185 in order to get a decoupling of the sym theory from all the other degrees of freedom we need @xmath186 and @xmath187 , and we see that this requires @xmath188 , so the radius of the sphere should obey @xmath189 . in this limit",
    "we obtain at low energies ( of order @xmath89 ) the pure sym theory .",
    "however , from the general considerations we described in section ( [ toqcd ] ) we expect that this limit will not correspond to a weakly coupled and weakly curved string theory dual .",
    "we will see that this is indeed the case .",
    "the discussion above suggests that the compactified theory has one dimensionless parameter , @xmath190 , in addition to @xmath2 and to the string scale @xmath29 ( which were parameters already in the six dimensional theory ) .",
    "the holographic dual of this compactification was found ( as a solution to supergravity , which should correspond to a solution to type iib string theory as well ) by maldacena and nuez in @xcite , by modifying and reinterpreting a solution from @xcite .    to write the solution ,",
    "let us parameterize the @xmath174 of ( [ nsmetric ] ) by @xmath191 and @xmath192 , and define a basis of 1-forms by @xmath193 , @xmath194 such that the volume form on @xmath174 is @xmath195 .",
    "let us parameterize the @xmath1 by @xmath196 ; note that these coordinates parameterize the @xmath1 which the dual `` little string theory '' is compactified on , but in our ten dimensional solution it is not necessarily the minimal 2-cycle at every value of the radial coordinate . and ,",
    "let us define the three components of an @xmath101 gauge field on @xmath1 by @xmath197 where @xmath198 , and denote the corresponding @xmath101 field strength by @xmath199 .",

    "so , the region near @xmath207 looks like @xmath208 , and the full solution ( [ mnmetric ] ) interpolates between @xmath209 near @xmath207 and @xmath210 for large @xmath172 .",
    "the dilaton , which decreases linearly as @xmath211 , goes to a constant value @xmath212 at the minimal radial position @xmath207 , which is the maximal value of the string coupling in this solution .",
    "this maximal string coupling is the additional dimensionless parameter of this solution ( compared to the six dimensional solution ( [ nsmetric ] ) ) . by examining the asymptotic value of the volume of the @xmath1",
    ", one can show that @xmath213 .",
    "thus , as expected , when this ratio is large ( as required for the sym limit ) we have strong coupling at small values of @xmath172 , and we do not have a good string theory description of the limit where we get the sym theory and there is an intermediate regime where the string coupling is of order one so neither description is valid .",
    "for large enough @xmath214 the supergravity approximation also breaks down and large curvatures arise for small @xmath172 . ] .",
    "however , for small @xmath214 the solution has weak coupling , weak curvatures and no ramond - ramond fields , so it is an `` ideal '' holographic background in which computations can easily be performed in string theory ( or in a supergravity approximation ) , and it is continuously related to the pure sym theory .      even in the regime of small",
    "@xmath214 , where we can trust supergravity ( and weakly coupled string theory ) , we can see that the theory has many properties similar to the ones we expect in the pure sym theory :    * mass gap  we can analyze the low - energy spectrum using supergravity and see that the theory has a mass gap . of course",
    ", in the regime where we can trust supergravity the qcd scale @xmath89 is of the same order as the kaluza - klein scale , and the mass gap is also of this order , so it does not make sense to compare the quantitative results to the sym theory .",
    "* confinement  we can compute the quark - anti - quark force at large distances and see that the potential it is linear . in this case , since we are talking about a gauge theory originating from ns5-branes , the external charged particles are the ends of d - strings , so the tension of the confining string ( the `` qcd string '' ) is that of a d - string sitting at @xmath207 and stretching in the @xmath215 directions . for large @xmath214 we can use the s - dual description for small @xmath172 , and in that regime",
    "the confining string tension is that of a fundamental string sitting at @xmath207 in the s - dual background . * chiral symmetry breaking",
    " one can show that the asymptotic metric at large @xmath172 has a @xmath216 symmetry which can be identified with the @xmath216 symmetry rotating the gluino in the pure sym theory @xcite . in field theory this symmetry is broken by the chiral anomaly to @xmath217 , and it is then spontaneously broken further to @xmath218 by the gluino condensate @xmath108 . in supergravity , this symmetry breaking turns out to be visible already at the classical level @xcite . in the asymptotic region of large @xmath172 the @xmath216 symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken to @xmath217 by the 3-form field ( [ mnthreeform ] ) , and in the region of small @xmath172 this symmetry is broken further to @xmath218 . *",
    "many other qcd - like properties are also visible in this background , like instantons , baryons , domain walls , the gluino condensate , and so on @xcite , but we will not discuss them in detail here .",
    "a third type of background which leads in an appropriate limit to the pure sym theory was presented in @xcite .",
    "i will not discuss it in detail here , since it is discussed in detail in klebanov s talks at this school .",
    "i will focus here only on the similarities and differences between this approach to qcd and the other approaches which were described in detail above .    like the maldacena - nuez background described in the previous section",
    ", the solution of @xcite also gives a smooth supergravity background , it has a parameter which can be continuously varied to give ( in some limit ) the pure @xmath14 sym theory ( though of course the supergravity approximation breaks down in this limit ) , and it has the same nice qcd - like properties discussed in the previous subsection ( including chiral symmetry breaking ) .",
    "an advantage of the solution of @xcite is that one does not encounter strong string coupling in the decoupling limit , but only large curvatures ( unlike the previous case , and like the polchinski - strassler case if we ignore the presence of the ns5-brane there ) .",
    "an important difference between the solutions it that the solution of @xcite involves ramond - ramond fields , so it is more difficult to analyze on the worldsheet ; however , note that as discussed above , if we want to use the solution of @xcite in the regime where it approaches qcd then we need to use s - duality and then this solution also has rr fields .",
    "another difference is that the high - energy properties of the klebanov - strassler solution are not completely clear ",
    "it appears to correspond to a new type of high - energy behavior which had not previously been encountered , called a `` duality cascade '' in @xcite .",
    "unlike the previous case that we discussed , here the theory remains @xmath148 dimensional at high energies , but the number of degrees of freedom appears to grow logarithmically with the energy scale .",
    "at this point ( summer 2002 ) we have several holographic duals to theories which at low energies include @xmath148 dimensional @xmath3 yang - mills theory ( or the @xmath14 sym theory ) , and involve also various additional massive fields .",
    "all of these dual theories have a parameter which interpolates between a regime where we can control the string theory side of the duality ( we have weak coupling and weak curvatures ) and another regime where the ( s)ym fields decouple from the massive degrees of freedom . however , the qualitative properties of the theory do not depend on this parameter  in the supersymmetric case one can argue that no phase transitions occur as this parameter is changed , and it is likely that this is true also in some non - supersymmetric cases .",
    "so , one can verify various qualitative properties of yang - mills theory using these holographic duals , such as confinement , the formation of a mass gap , chiral symmetry breaking , etc . on the other hand , quantitative properties of the theory , like the ratio between the confining string tension and the square of the mass gap , depend non - trivially on the interpolating parameter , so they can not be computed without obtaining some control over string theory in the strongly curved ( and sometimes also strongly coupled ) regime .",
    "these constructions give us a proof in principle that ( super ) yang - mills theory has a dual string theory description , involving the usual type iib string theory ( rather than exotic new string theories ) , and formally we can define this dual string theory by a limiting procedure .",
    "however , currently we do not know how to control this limit , or how to directly define the limiting string theory without all the extra degrees of freedom .",
    "of course , we expect that the three different paths described above should all lead to the same string theory in the appropriate decoupling limit , but it is not clear how this actually happens ( perhaps there are several dual descriptions of the limiting string theory ) .",
    "in these talks i focussed on the supersymmetric case .",
    "going to non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory seems to be straightforward in the first scenario i described ( the polchinski - strassler background ) , but it is more difficult in the other two scenarios . in the scenario of @xcite one can perhaps do this by supersymmetry - breaking deformations along the lines of @xcite ; in the scenario of @xcite this may also be possible but the rules for performing deformations there are not completely clear since we do not fully understand the high - energy theory .",
    "i discussed here only the case of @xmath3 gauge theories , but it is not difficult to generalize all the solutions found above also to the case of @xmath219 and @xmath220 gauge groups @xcite .",
    "i also focussed in these talks exclusively on the pure ( super)yang - mills case , although for qcd we obviously want to add quark flavors as well .",
    "a recent general discussion on some possible ways to do this may be found in @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank all the people i collaborated with on related topics , and all the people with which i discussed large @xmath2 field theories and string theory , which are too numerous to be listed here .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the cargse 2002 advanced summer institute for an enjoyable and stimulating school , and the students at the school for asking many good questions during these lectures .",

    "<S> in these lecture notes from the 2002 cargese summer school we review the progress that has been made towards finding a string theory for qcd ( or for pure ( super)yang - mills theory ) following the discovery of the ads / cft correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> we start with a brief review of the ads / cft correspondence and a general discussion of its application to the construction of a string theory for qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we then discuss in detail two possible paths towards a qcd string theory , one which uses a mass deformation of the @xmath0 super yang - mills theory ( the polchinski - strassler background ) and the other using a compactification of `` little string theory '' on @xmath1 ( the maldacena - nuez solution ) . a third approach ( the klebanov - strassler solution ) </S>",
    "<S> is described in other lectures of this school . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly assess the advantages and disadvantages of all three approaches . </S>"
