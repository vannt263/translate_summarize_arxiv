    "in the phenomenological approach to decoherence , one defines a markov map for the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the system .",
    "this map is expected to be an approximation of the true dynamics of a system interacting with an environment .",
    "indeed , it can often be derived via some simplifying assumptions : typically in fact , like _",
    "e.g. _ in the caldeira  legget model ,",
    "the environment consists of a system with infinitely many degrees of freedom , whose exact dynamics is too complicate to be dealt with exactly .",
    "this approach has proven to be very effective : one can list among its most important successes the explanation of the puzzling behavior of quantum schrdinger cats @xcite and the emergence of classical properties in quantum mechanics @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "a few years ago , the idea was proposed that decoherence might also explain the problem of quantum chaos , that is , it could restore dynamical chaos in the quantum evolution , that was missing in pure systems evolving via the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "actually , this approach has a longer history : as early as 1984 guarneri @xcite had shown that allowing a random perturbation in the dynamics of a kicked rotor washed away the phenomenon of quantum localization of classical chaos and ott _ et al . _",
    "@xcite had worked out the parameter dependence of the ensuing diffusion coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "dittrich and graham @xcite , kolovsky @xcite and later sundaram et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the classical and quantum dynamics of a system , whose coupling to the environment leads to diffusion with coefficient @xmath0 , are similar whenever @xmath1 ( here , @xmath2 is the lyapunov exponent ) is larger than @xmath3 times a dimensional constant .",
    "indeed , in the presence of diffusion , the finest resolution discernable in phase space , @xmath4 scales as @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the conventional explanation goes by saying that when the latter quantity is larger than the discreteness of quantum phase space , of size @xmath3 , quantum effects do not have room to show up . in the quoted references",
    "the similarity between the two dynamics has been exhibited by comparing classical phase ",
    "space distributions and wigner functions , first visually and then by using a suitable distance function .",
    "the system that has been most frequently analized in these investigations is the celebrated arnold cat map @xcite , on which the failure of the correspondence principle ( properly defined @xcite ) has been exhibited .",
    "therefore , the following is a tale of two cats , schrdinger versus arnold : are the properties of decoherence exhibited by the former enough to assure the strong chaotic signatures of the second ?",
    "the fate of the decoherence approach to quantum chaos lies in the answer to this question .",
    "it must be remarked from the start that it is generally believed that the question above must be answered in the positive .",
    "in fact , the theory relying upon effective equations for the density matrix mentioned above is certainly fruitful and physically motivated  as testified by an ever increasing list of works  and seems to support this point . yet , in our view , two points need to be investigated more deeply before the final word be said .",
    "firstly , the master equation approach can not provide a complete answer to the problem of quantum  classical correspondence , no more than a phenomenological theory of fundamental interactions can be a complete field theory . rather , one would like to have a fully dynamical , fully quantal calculation exhibiting the same phenomena of which the phenomenological approach is an approximation @xcite .",
    "this theory should also render evident the scaling relations in the physical parameters by which the limiting approximations are validated .",
    "secondly , we believe that this theory should address a very specific kind of questions . indicators of some sort of irregularity abound in the field if quantum chaos @xcite , each possessing its relevance and limitations . yet",
    ", we claim that since the essence of chaos is deterministic randomness ( see @xcite for a readable argumentation of this point ) , its foremost indicators must be information  theoretical .",
    "moreover , if the classical limit is concerned , they must necessarily refer to the dynamical structure of phase space @xcite .    in previous works",
    "@xcite we have used algorithmic complexity to gauge chaos in dynamical systems . in this paper , we rely on an equivalent quantity , the alicki fannes quantum dynamical entropy , hereby referred to as a - f @xcite that offers the advantages of being computable to a certain extent , of arising from the consistent histories formalism @xcite and of translating in the quantum domain the same construction procedure of the classical kolmogorov sinai entropy .    while the a - f entropy of systems with finite  dimensional hilbert spaces is null , the scaling of the finite time shannon entropies required for its construction is nonetheless informative .",
    "we shall compute this quantity for a quantum arnold cat that encounters multi  particle scattering .",
    "indeed , that scattering by small particles can provide a fully dynamical model of decoherence has been already shown by joos and zeh @xcite : we shall only render this model explicit and computable in a form that well ties with the classical model for the arnold cat map , that can be seen as the floquet evolution of a kicked particle on a torus .",
    "as noted above , many works have already appeared linking decoherence and chaoticity , so that any list of references , including ours @xcite is forced to be utterly partial . nonetheless , we believe that the two theoretical points raised above have never been studied together so far .",
    "we therefore present in this paper the first results of our analysis , via information  theoretical dynamical entropies , of a fully dynamical model of a decohering system .",
    "further study , both from the theoretical and the numerical point of view , will follow .    in the next section we review the classical arnold cat and its quantization . then , in sect .",
    "[ sec - mpac ] we introduce the multi  particle arnold cat , in its classical and quantum versions .",
    "the problems involved in deriving a scattering matrix for quantum particles on a torus are solved in sect .",
    "[ sec - scat ] .",
    "next , in sect .",
    "[ sec - af ] we review the essential ingredients of a - f entropy , particularly the finite time shannon alicki fannes entropy , that is then computed numerically in sect . [ sec - resu ] for the multi ",
    "particle arnold cat .",
    "its scaling with the system parameters is examined and it is discussed in the conclusions .",
    "consider a point particle of mass @xmath5 subject to move on a ring .",
    "mathematically , this ring is a torus , of length @xmath6 , labelled by the variable @xmath7 . in the absence of any interaction",
    ", this particle rotates with constant velocity around the ring . to the contrary",
    ", it is also subject to the action of a periodic impulsive force , of period @xmath8 , that has the effect of changing instantaneously its momentum : the relative hamiltonian is therefore @xmath9 @xmath10 being the conjugate momentum to @xmath11 and @xmath12 a coupling constant .",
    "this is the hamiltonian for the arnold cat mapping .",
    "in fact , it entails a classical period evolution operator that acts as follows on the dynamical variables observed at the time immediately following the action of the impulsive force : @xmath13 it is now convenient to rescale momentum @xmath10 by multiplying it by @xmath14 . the new momentum",
    ", @xmath15 has the dimensions of a length . in the new variables ,",
    "the action of the period evolution operator becomes : @xmath16    in addition , we stipulate that the rescaled momentum variable @xmath17 is also periodic , of the same period @xmath6 as of @xmath11 , so that classical dynamics evolve in a two  dimensional torus . it is easy to see that the hamiltonian map ( [ eq - ham3 ] ) can be made consistent with this geometry by choosing @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be an integer .",
    "indeed , letting @xmath20 exactly yields the renown classical arnold cat on the two  dimensional torus .",
    "we shall always assume this condition in the following .",
    "the quantization of the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham1 ] ) have been performed in @xcite with semiclassical means and canonically in @xcite to which we refer for additional comments .",
    "rigorous mathematical work has clarified the generality of the kinematical procedure @xcite , while physics stands as in the original work of schwinger @xcite and is indeed quite elementary .",
    "in fact , periodicity in the @xmath11 variable implies that that wave  functions can be written in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the momentum eigenfunctions and @xmath23 are the expansion coefficients , with integer @xmath24 .",
    "we need next to impose periodicity in @xmath10 with period @xmath25 .",
    "recall that the momentum operator is @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 and the eigenmomentum is @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , going to the momentum representation we must have that @xmath29 for any @xmath24 , where @xmath30 is an integer number satisfying @xmath31 and obviously @xmath32 is planck s constant .",
    "we may certainly set @xmath18 here and in the following , with no loss of generality , since one parameter can be freely chosen .",
    "( [ eq - ham6 ] ) has a physical origin : in order to realize quantum dynamics on a two dimensional torus of unit periodicity in the @xmath11 direction , the periodicity in @xmath10 must be an integer multiple of the planck constant . as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq - ham6v ] ) , letting @xmath23 = @xmath33 in the expansion ( [ eq - ham5 ] ) factors out a periodic train of delta functions at the spatial locations @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , and @xmath36 a fixed shift .",
    "functions can therefore be represented as vectors in a finite  dimensional hilbert space of dimension @xmath30 , that can be formally expressed in a convenient normalization as @xmath37 the dual momentum representation is easily obtained by a discrete fourier transform of the former : letting @xmath38 , this is @xmath39    observe finally that the dimension of the hilbert space is directly proportional to the mass @xmath5 of the particle .",
    "this is in line with our approach of performing the classical limit in its more transparent physical form , by keeping @xmath3 to its real physical value and by considering a particle of larger and larger mass @xmath5 .    by standard quantization procedures",
    "one therefore compute the matrix representations of the evolution operator .",
    "this has been effected in @xcite .",
    "we reproduce here the formulae holding in the position representation , where the state vector has components @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the action of the free evolution @xmath42 induced by the free rotation @xmath43 has matrix elements @xmath44 the quantum arnold cat evolution operator is the product @xmath45 , where @xmath42 has been defined just above and @xmath46 is the operator with matrix elements @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the kronecker delta , that corresponds to the impulsive part of the hamiltonian .",
    "we now consider a more complex system consisting of a single large particle of mass @xmath5 and of a number @xmath49 of smaller particles of mass @xmath50 , that are also bound to move on the same ring .",
    "let @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 the coordinates and momenta of these particles , respectively .",
    "we require that also the phase space of the small particles is a two dimensional torus , of @xmath18 periodicity in the variables @xmath51 and of periodicity @xmath54 in the momenta @xmath52 .",
    "we must therefore have @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an integer .",
    "the wave  functions of the small particles also take on the form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - ham5b],[eq - ham5c ] ) , with @xmath56 in place of @xmath30 .",
    "particles wave  functions can be written on the basis of momentum eigen  functions as @xmath57    notice that the coordinates @xmath51 are restricted to a lattice of spacing @xmath58 , containing @xmath56 points .",
    "similarly , the momenta @xmath52 live on the lattice @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .    in this paper",
    ", we choose @xmath30 to be an integer multiple of @xmath56 ( that is , @xmath61 , that also means that the large mass @xmath5 is a multiple of the small mass @xmath50 , _ i.e. _ @xmath62 ) .",
    "we also impose that the position  momentum lattice of a small particle is a subset of that of the large one : to achieve this , we write the position lattice of the @xmath63-th particle in the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 an integer measuring the shift of the position lattice of the @xmath63-th particle with respect to that of the large particle .",
    "the allowed values of the constants @xmath65 range from zero to @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , in the position representation the state of the system is represented by the values of @xmath67 at @xmath68 , that we label as @xmath69 using the index zero for the large particle .",
    "mapping to and from the two representations is easily effected via the multi - dimensional discrete fourier transformation .",
    "having taken care of kinematics , let s focus on dynamics : the hamiltonian of the multi ",
    "particle arnold cat is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a coupling constant and the function @xmath72 will be described momentarily .",
    "small particles also rotate freely on the torus , except for an interaction potential @xmath72 with the large particle .",
    "the form of the interaction translates elastic scattering between the large particle and each of the smaller ones . in turn",
    ", these latter do not interact among themselves .",
    "it is easy , although not necessary at this stage , to introduce also an interaction among the small particles .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham10 ] ) follows the decoherence program of joos and zeh @xcite : the large particle encounters frequent collisions with the small ones , that should ultimately result into decoherence and classicality .",
    "we must now make precise the interaction potential @xmath72 appearing in the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham10 ] ) . our goal would be to have a hard core potential equal to a dirac delta function , representing a perfectly elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "yet , we have to cope with the fact that kinematics takes place in the tensor product of quantized two  dimensional tori . on the one hand , this makes the problem easily solvable , as we now show . on the other hand ,",
    "it yields significant new features in the scattering process which will be described elsewhere .    since we are considering only the interaction between the large particle and each small one independently",
    ", we can write the interaction potential @xmath72 in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the interaction matrix in the @xmath75 subspace ( for convenience of notation , we shall also let the index @xmath76 label the position ",
    "momentum of the large particle : @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 is the identity in the orthogonal complement of the @xmath75 subspace .",
    "the interaction between the large ( zeroth ) particle and the @xmath63-th small one is effective only when they sit on the same lattice point : it is therefore convenient to specify the scattering potential directly in the position representation , where @xmath67 is defined by its values at the lattice positions @xmath68 . in this basis",
    "we have @xmath80 where @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 range from @xmath76 to @xmath84 , while @xmath85 and @xmath86 range from @xmath76 to @xmath87 .",
    "as anticipated , the last kronecker delta requires that the particle @xmath76 and @xmath63 sit at the same lattice point . according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq - scat1 ] ) and ( [ eq - scat2 ] ) , the full matrix elements of @xmath72 are therefore @xmath88 it is therefore apparent that @xmath72 is diagonal in the coordinate representation .",
    "finally , the form of the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham10 ] ) suggests a numerical technique for the quantum evolution .",
    "write symbolically @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the free motion hamiltonian , @xmath91 is the scattering contribution , and @xmath46 is the impulsive force ( acting only on the @xmath11 coordinate ) . then",
    ", the full period evolution operator @xmath92 can again be written as the product of @xmath93 and of @xmath94 . in turn , the former can be evaluated as a trotter product form @xmath95 whose accuracy increases by increasing the integer number of partitions @xmath96 of the interval @xmath97 .",
    "numerical convenience demands finally that each exponential be evaluated in the basis where the corresponding operator is diagonal .",
    "this is swiftly accomplished by tangling the products above with fast fourier multidimensional transformations .",
    "the full code has been programmed in stone  age fortran 77 language , of which the author is a proud cultivator .",
    "the essential ingredient of defining a dynamical entropy is coarse  graining , that leads to symbolic dynamics .",
    "suppose that the hilbert space of the system is partitioned into cells , corresponding to projection operators @xmath98 , so that their sum is the identity operator : @xmath99 . given any initial state @xmath100 , quantum evolution yields the vector @xmath101 at any future ( or past ) time @xmath102 , with @xmath103 and @xmath104 an observation delay .",
    "clearly , the probability that the quantum system is found in macro  state @xmath24 at time @xmath105 is given by the square modulus of @xmath106 .",
    "the `` quantum history '' of a vector @xmath100 is the result of repeated projections on macro  states , followed by unitary evolution . if the choice of the macrostate at time @xmath105 is indicated by @xmath107 , and if the string of choices at successive times is entered in the vector @xmath108 of length @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( this is called a `` word '' in symbolic dynamics ) the quantum history of the vector @xmath100 is @xmath111 for convenience of notation we shall put @xmath112 the `` amplitude '' @xmath113 , when averaged over initial conditions @xmath100 , as we shall do momentarily , is the analogue of the measure of the classical phase space cylinder associated with the symbolic dynamics @xmath114 .",
    "the formal analogy is completed by noting the equivalence of @xmath92 with the inverse of the classical map . in both classical and quantum dynamics these probabilities add up to one : @xmath115 in quantum mechanics , though , interference reigns and the products @xmath116 are non - null also when @xmath117 .",

    "it is null .",
    "nonetheless we ascribe particular importance to the s - a - f entropies @xmath124 even before the limit is taken and the required supremum over partitions is effected .",
    "in fact , these finite - partition , finite - time entropies , _ and their scaling behavior _ with respect to the system parameters are in our view the most significant physical quantities .",
    "the numerical problem of computing the quantity @xmath124 for systems with a finite dimensional hilbert space has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "one consider a different matrix , also introduced by a - f , with the same spectral properties as @xmath0 , but with a size that is independent of the word length @xmath109 .",
    "relying on the properties of this latter matrix , derived in @xcite , a general purpose parallel code has been designed and will be employed in this paper .",
    "let us now consider a partition of classical phase  space in four equal cells of rectangular shape , defined by letting the position of the large particle , @xmath11 , belong to the sets @xmath128 . in these cells the momentum @xmath10 of the large particle and the coordinates ( positions and momenta ) of the small ones take on all the allowed values .",
    "this partition can be easily generalized , but there is no need to do that in the present context . given this partition , when",

    "we observe that as @xmath30 increases , the linear behavior ( and the numerical values ) of the classical cat is approached , for a region in @xmath109 of increasing size .",
    "this region terminates as soon as the linear increase of @xmath124 is hampered by the finiteness of hilbert space , via the bound @xmath135 . here , @xmath136 .",

    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    ", one must notice that the variables involved have an exponential role .",
    "the number of particles , @xmath49 , appears in the exponent of the hilbert space dimension @xmath120 , and numerical computation of the shannon entropies @xmath124 has a computational cost that scales as a power of @xmath120 , depending on implementation @xcite .",
    "the runs for this paper have required thousands of cpu hours on large clusters of processors . far from being a limitation of the technique ,",
    "this computational complexity reveals the physical depth of the alicki fannes entropies , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "it also explains why these quantum entropies have not ( yet ) received the attention they deserve , because they are so difficult to compute .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a multi  particle version of the celebrated arnold cat mapping .",
    "it was devised with the aim to study dynamically the validity of the decoherence approach to quantum chaos .",
    "we have reported preliminary data showing the path to be taken to decide the case .",
    "in fact , the following course of investigation lies now clear in front of us : one should first compute the classical shannon entropies @xmath124 for a generating partition of phase space and compare them with the a - f shannon entropies for the same partition . given a fixed precision @xmath152 and a fixed mass of the small particles @xmath50 , find pairs of parameters @xmath5 ( mass of the large particle ) and @xmath49 ( number of small particles ) so that the classical and quantum @xmath124 coincide within precision @xmath152 for all @xmath109 smaller than a maximal value @xmath153 . at this point one",
    "should verify whether there exists sequences of @xmath154 that grow at most polynomially in @xmath153 .",
    "if this were to be the case , one could conclude that indeed the decoherence approach can justify on physical grounds the correspondence principle for chaotic systems , at least as far as the total information production is concerned .",
    "it is altogether clear that this endeavor is highly challenging , given the computational complexity described at the end of the previous section . yet , our data ( that although preliminary have required extensive computation and coding development @xcite ) seem to indicate that the effort might be successful .    in sequence",
    ", one should then consider the specific ( as opposed to global ) information production : one should investigate , under the same conditions just specified , whether individual histories become consistent , thereby reproducing the classical measures of dynamical cylinders .",
    "this remarkable fact has been shown so far only for under markovian equations @xcite and it seems to appear also in qsd models @xcite , but to our knowledge it has never been derived under `` controlled '' dynamical conditions such as those advocated in our approach .",
    "all these investigations will be the matter of our future efforts .",
    "it is finally worth to remark a related endeavor that points in the same direction : the similarity of a quantum system with a classical system on a lattice @xcite has been confirmed by studying algorithmic information content and classical kolmogorov sinai shannon entropies @xcite @xcite .",
    "if in addition a random noise is introduced , a regime in parameter space has been shown to exist so that the discrete system with randomness outputs information at the same rate as the classical continuous system @xcite .",
