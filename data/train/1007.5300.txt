    "the origin of solar and stellar flares is thought to be the impulsive release of energy from a non - potential magnetic field due to an instability arising from magnetic loop foot - point motions in the photosphere , resulting in plasma heating , particle acceleration , shocks and mass motions , involving the entire outer atmosphere , and producing emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "flares of all sizes are useful probes of coronal structures , under the assumption that there is no difference in the flaring and non - flaring coronal structures during the impulsive and transitory energy input .",
    "extreme flare events are useful for revealing the extent to which solar flare physics can be extrapolated ( and thus the applicability of the solar model in a variety of stellar environments ) , and for enabling stellar flare diagnostic techniques which require high signal - to - noise .",
    "it has long been known that the largest observed stellar flares on `` normal '' stars ( i.e. non - degenerate , non - accreting stars ) represent energetic releases which are orders of magnitude more than typical solar flares  up to a factor of 10@xmath12 more energetic ( compared to a typical solar flare energy of @xmath13 erg ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. @xmath7 10@xmath14 erg @xcite .",
    "yet the energy radiated as a result of plasma heating usually represents only a small fraction of the total energy involved in a solar flare : @xcite estimate that the energy contribution of nonthermal particles in solar flares is @xmath15 a factor of 10 higher than the amount of thermal plasma heating as expressed in their soft x - ray emission , and @xcite showed that the total solar flare energy can be up to 110 times that seen in the goes soft x - ray band from 1.212 kev .",
    "white light solar flares are difficult to detect in total solar irradiance measurements due to the contrast between the flaring emission and total solar disk emission , whereas the red nature of the underlying m dwarf spectrum makes the blue flare continuum emission easier to detect . in solar white light flares",
    "there is a timing and spatial correlation between the white light flare emission and signatures of nonthermal emission such as hard x - ray emission @xcite , and radiative hydrodynamical simulations of the impact of electron beams in the lower atmosphere can reproduce the observed solar continuum enhancements @xcite , but extension of the same models to flares on m dwarfs has not to date been able to reproduce the observed continuum enhancements @xcite .",
    "large flares from m dwarf stars have been known at optical wavelengths for several decades ; the uv / optical / infrared spectral energy distribution typically peaks at short wavelengths , with a roughly blackbody shape @xcite having a blackbody temperature @xmath16 of @xmath710@xmath17k .",
    "enhancements of greater than a few magnitudes are large amplitude events which occur rarely ; @xcite found 7 out of 52 flares in the galex data archives to have @xmath18 4.4 .",
    "the most extreme stellar flare ever observed at ground - based near - uv / optical wavelengths may be that of v374 peg @xcite , at @xmath19u=11.0 .",
    "soft x - ray flares result from the transient plasma heating that occurs as a result of energy deposition lower in the atmosphere . in the corona ,",
    "magnetic field pressure exceeds the gas pressure and therefore dominates the dynamics .",
    "the non - flaring coronal emission is easy to understand in terms of an optically thin , multi - temperature , and possibly multi - density , plasma in coronal equilibrium",
    ". the x - ray spectral region also contains diagnostics which have been used recently in large stellar flares to diagnose the presence of nonthermal electrons operating during a large stellar flare @xcite as well as probe the interaction between the corona and the lower atmosphere @xcite .",
    "changes in the characteristics of the flaring plasma with time lead to deductions about heating time - scales , place constraints on spatial scales , and provide evidence for temporary enrichment of coronal material with plasma from the lower layers of the atmosphere .",
    "`` superflares '' , in which the soft x - ray luminosity increases by @xmath20 a factor of 100 compared to its normal value , are rare but have been seen on several different active stars @xcite .",
    "as the quiescent x - ray luminosity of active stars is already at a high level relative to the underlying bolometric luminosity ( l@xmath0/l@xmath6 @xmath15 10@xmath21 ) , such an increase during a flare produces a temporary but significant increase in the total luminosity of the star .",
    "the nearby ( d=5.06 pc ) flare star ev  lac has a record of frequent and large outbursts across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "@xcite reported a long - lasting ( @xmath22 hrs ) flare with a peak enhancement of @xmath19u= 5.9 , while @xcite observed a flare from ev  lac with @xmath19u= 6.4 at peak which lasted @xmath7 911 hours .",
    "@xcite noted frequent soft x - ray flares from ev  lac .",
    "its bolometric luminosity l@xmath6 has been estimated by @xcite as 5.25@xmath110@xmath23 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields covering a substantial fraction of the surface ( @xmath24 @xmath7 4 kg , @xmath25 @xmath750% ) have been measured @xcite .",
    "the extreme magnetic activity as revealed by the flare observations is mirrored in complementary measures of changes in the large - scale magnetic field configuration on relatively short time - scales of less than an hour @xcite .",
    "here we describe the properties of a flare serendipitously observed on ev  lac by the swift gamma - ray burst satellite , the konus grb experiment on the wind satellite , and observed in a fast follow - up by the liverpool telescope .",
    "the flare is remarkable in the magnitude of the peak enhancement at optical and soft and hard x - ray energies .",
    "the current paper provides an overview of the datasets involved and their reduction (  2 ) , determinations of variations in plasma parameters during the flare , accompanying analysis of x - ray spectral features , and derivation of parameters from optical data (  3 ) .",
    "section 4 discusses flare energy estimates , compares the current flare with other large - scale flares , and the use of the fe k@xmath10 6.4 kev line to diagnose conditions in the flaring plasma , while section 5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "an overview of the telescopes and observatories which obtained data for this ev  lac flare is given in figure  [ fig : flarelc ] , which delineates the timing and relative intensity of the several x - ray and @xmath26-ray observations made by swift and konus , and also the timing of the uv and optical observations made by swift and on the ground from the liverpool telescope .",
    "all timing is referenced to the burst alert telescope ( bat ) trigger time , 2008 - 04 - 25 05:13:57 ut ; we refer to this as t0 .",
    "konus @xcite is an instrument on the wind spacecraft which provides omni - directional and continuous coverage of cosmic gamma - ray transients .",
    "the flare was detected in waiting mode by the s2 detector which observes the north ecliptic hemisphere .",
    "the background is very stable in the s2 detector .",
    "there is a statistically significant bump in count rate in the lowest energy range ( 18 - 70 kev ) from @xmath7t0 - 100:t0 + 140 s of 5875@xmath9692 counts , which likely indicates the beginning of the superflare .",
    "there is also a possible tail until @xmath7t0 + 1000 s. in addition , there may be a precursor event from @xmath7t0 - 700:t0 - 400 s with 2117@xmath9791 counts .",
    "timing analysis shows that the propagation time from the wind spacecraft to the swift spacecraft is 2.125 s , so the bat trigger time ( ut 05:13:57 ) corrected for time - of - flight is ut 05:13:54.875 at konus .",
    "the peak in the konus light curve shown in figure  [ fig : flarelc ] indicates that the flare peaked @xmath760 seconds before the bat trigger .",
    "the konus data can be used to estimate the onset and rise time of the hard x - ray emission from the flare , and indicate a relatively fast rise time of less than 2 minutes .      swift s burst alert telescope @xcite triggered on the flare from ev  lac during a pre - planned spacecraft slew ; the trigger occurred at 2008 - 04 - 25 ut 05:13:57 = t0 .",
    "there was a short pointing during which the discovery image was made with bat , a second slew to place the star in the apertures of the narrow - field instruments ( x - ray telescope [ xrt ] and uv optical telescope [ uvot ] ) , and a second longer pointing which overlaps the xrt data .",
    "the hard x - ray source was already declining in flux as it entered the bat field of view during the pre - planned slew , with a peak intensity in the bat 15 - 50 kev band of about 0.15 photons @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "comparison of the bat and konus / wind light curves in figure  [ fig : flarelc ] shows that the bat triggered on the flare near its maximum in the hard x - ray band .",
    "light curves were extracted in the most sensitive 1430.1 kev range where the spectral distribution peaks , and were cleaned of the contaminating sources cyg - x1 , cyg - x2 , and 3a  0114 + 650 which were in the partially coded field of view .",
    "spectra from 14 - 100 kev were extracted for four time intervals , indicated in figure  [ fig : flarelc ] , for which there was enough signal .",
    "the x - ray telescope @xcite started to observe the source at 05:16:48ut ( 166s after the _",
    "swift_-bat trigger , t0 ) .",
    "the xrt observes from 0.3 - 10 kev using ccd detectors , with energy resolution in the iron k region ( 6 kev ) of @xmath15 140 ev as measured at launch time . to produce the cleaned and calibrated event files ,",
    "all the data were reduced using the _ swift _ xrtpipeline task ( version 11.5 ) and calibration files from the caldb 2.8 release .",
    "a cleaned event list was generated using the default pipeline , which removes the effects of hot pixels and the bright earth .",
    "the initial data recording was in windowed timing ( wt ) mode , due to the large count rate ( initially @xmath151000 count s@xmath4 ) ; from approximately 6160 s after the trigger to the end of the observation ( roughly 40ks after the bat trigger ) data were taken in photon counting ( pc ) mode .",
    "the x - ray light curve was produced using the _ swift_-xrt light curve generator @xcite . note that this tool takes into account the pile - up correction which is applied to the data when necessary . from the cleaned event list , the source and background spectra were extracted using xselect .",
    "we only use grade 0 - 2 events in wt mode and grade 0 - 12 events in pc mode , which optimize the effective area and hence the number of collected counts .",
    "the ancillary response files ( arf ) for the pc and wt modes were produced using xrtmkarf , taking into account the point - spread function correction @xcite as well as the exposure map correction .",
    "the exposure maps were produced using the xrtexpomap task ( version 2.4 ) .",
    "the v010 response matrix files ( rmfs ) ( swxwt0to2s6@xmath2720010101v010.rmf in wt mode and swxpc0to12s6@xmath2720010101v010.rmf in pc mode ) were used to perform the spectral analysis @xcite .    during the process of creation of the spectra and the light curve , we took great care to correct the data for the effect of pile - up in both pc and wt modes .",
    "indeed , the effects of pile - up result in an apparent loss of flux , particularly from the center of the point spread function ( psf ) , and a migration of 012 grades ( considered as grades resulting from x - ray events ) to higher grades and energies at high count rates .",
    "the high observed count rates in wt mode ( several hundred counts s@xmath4 ) and pc mode ( above 2 counts s@xmath4 ) indicate that the data are piled - up . in wt mode",
    ", we produced a sample of grade ratio distribution using background - subtracted source event lists created by increasing the size of the inner radius of an annular extraction region with an outer radius of 30 pixels ( 1 pixel = 2.36 \" ) .",
    "the grade ratio distribution for grade 0 , 1 & 2 events is defined as the ratio of grade 0 , 1 & 2 events over the sum of grade 0 - 2 events per energy bin in the 0.3 - 10 kev energy range .",
    "we then compared this sample of grade ratio distribution with that obtained using non piled - up wt data in order to estimate the number of pixels to exclude , finding that an exclusion of the innermost 6 pixels was necessary when all the wt data are used . in pc mode , we used the same methodology as described in @xcite to estimate the number of pixels which needs to be excluded .",
    "we fit the wings of the source radial psf profile with the xrt psf model ( a king function ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a background component ( here assumed to be a constant ) .",
    "the exclusion of the innermost 5 pixels enables us to mitigate the effects of pile - up .",
    "the ultra - violet / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) began observing ev lac , at ut 05:16:35 ( 157s after the _",
    "swift_-bat trigger , t0 ) , and performed a sequence of automatic observations .",
    "the first observation was an 8.08s settling exposure , which is usually taken in event / image mode with the @xmath28 filter while the uvot stabilizes and prepares for settled observations .",
    "the second observation , a 200s @xmath29 finding chart exposure , was not completed , because the safety circuit tripped .",
    "the trip occurred at ut 05:16:51.3 , 1.4s after the uvot had finished moving the filter wheel to @xmath29 .",
    "the safety circuit tripped due to a rate of @xmath30300 000 count s@xmath4 being observed over 31 frames ( each of 11ms ) , implying that ev lac must have been brighter than 7th magnitude in @xmath29 for a minimum of 1.4s .",
    "the uvot resumed observations at @xmath31  ks , taking multiple exposures using the 7 filters of the uvot ( @xmath29 , @xmath28 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "table  [ tbl : mag ] lists the observed magnitudes measured with uvot at various times during the flare .",
    "the errors are purely statistical and do not reflect any systematic or calibration uncertainties .",
    "a description of the effective wavelengths and bandwidths of the swift / uvot filters can be found at ` http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/about_swift/uvot_desc.html ` .",
    "emission in the @xmath28 band from ev lac was saturated during the settling exposure , providing a limit for the brightness in @xmath28 of @xmath3711.48 magnitude .",
    "however , during this exposure , ev lac was sufficiently bright that it was accompanied by an out - of - focus halo of light that has undergone multiple reflections within the instrument .",
    "because the count rate of the halo and the flux of the source are related linearly , we are able to use the halo to determine the brightness of ev lac during the settling exposure .    in order to provide a calibration for the halo of ev lac",
    ", we searched the _ swift _ archive for stars of known brightness , which are bright enough to produce a halo .",
    "we identified 9 stars with uvot observations in the @xmath28 filter , with @xmath28 magnitudes in the gsc-2 database ranging from 6.07 to 10.51 , and with suitable halos .    to determine the count rates of the halos in the uvot images , source regions and background regions were created for ev lac and for each of the 9 stars",
    "for each object , the source region was chosen to cover the entire halo , but excluding the central object itself and its diffraction spikes , any visible background sources , and the diffraction troughs in the halo .",
    "the corresponding background region was taken as a set of circular apertures , placed on source - free areas of the sky , with a total area of at least twice that of the source region .    for each",
    "of the 9 stars , the count rate of the halo was determined and then scaled to the source area of ev lac .",
    "these values were then plotted against the count rates that would be predicted in the absence of coincidence loss in 5 radius apertures using the @xmath28 zero point given in @xcite .",
    "a linear function was fitted to obtain the ratio between the halo count rates and predicted count rates of the stars .",
    "we multiplied the halo count rate of ev lac by this ratio to obtain the corresponding coincidence - loss - free count rate of ev lac in an aperture of 5 radius , and converted this into a @xmath28 magnitude using the zero point of @xcite . in order to determine the calibration uncertainty on the @xmath28 magnitude",
    ", we divided the count rates of the halo calibration stars by the corresponding values of the best - fit linear model and then took the standard deviation of the resulting numbers to be the 1@xmath38 fractional error .",
    "this leads to an estimate of @xmath397.2@xmath90.2 , compared to a v of 10.1 during quiescence .    for the rest of the images , in order to be compatible with the uvot calibration @xcite , source counts were obtained using an aperture of radius of 5 and background counts were obtained from a region of radius 20 , positioned on a source - free area of the sky .",
    "ev lac was found to be saturated in the @xmath29 , @xmath28 and @xmath32 filters .",
    "the software used to determine the source count rates can be found in the software release headas 6.5 and version 20071106 of the uvot calibration files .",
    "count rates were corrected for coincidence loss and converted into magnitudes following the prescription in @xcite .",
    "we used the swift uvot tool to estimate the count rate and therefore magnitude of the star during quiescence ( for an m5 spectral type ) in the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath33 filters , in order to determine the flare enhancements of the star .",
    "we obtained additional too observations of ev  lac nearly a year later to determine its quiescent magnitude in the @xmath34 , @xmath36 , and @xmath35 filters .",
    "these quiescent magnitudes are listed in table[tbl : mag ] and were subtracted from the flare magnitudes to investigate the photometric variations at late times in the flare , as illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : flarelc ] .",
    "the liverpool telescope took a series of 3x10 s images in the sdss - r filter @xmath7 15 minutes after the trigger as part of the standard grb follow - up .",
    "no further observations were taken once the trigger was identified as a non - grb .",
    "photometry was done with gaia calibrating sdss - r images against the usnob1-r2 magnitudes of the few stars in the field .",
    "the night was not photometric so systematic errors of 0.2 mag ( 1 @xmath38 ) are added to all measurements , which also accounts for the difference between the r2 magnitude of the usnob1 catalog @xcite and the r band .",
    "photometry was performed on each of the 3 frames and a co - added 30 s frame using an aperture with a radius of 8 arcsec .",
    "the differences between magnitudes in the three 10 s frames were @xmath370.05 mag so we decided to estimate the final magnitudes on the co - added frame .",
    "this results in the r2 magnitude of ev  lac being 7.4@xmath90.2 .",
    "there is a nearby star , gl  873b , which at the time of the observations was @xmath150.5 arcminutes from ev  lac , which was used to check the photometry .",
    "its magnitude in the r2 band is measured to be 10.9@xmath90.2 , and its catalogued magnitude is r2@xmath710.6 , consistent within the errors with the value obtained here .",
    "the estimated magnitude for ev  lac during this observation is @xmath7 2 magnitudes brighter than the catalogued one ( r2@xmath79.5 ) .",
    "we have performed a spectral analysis using xspec v12.4.0 @xcite of the bat data for several time intervals during which the hard x - ray spectra were the only data collected : viz .",
    ", during the first slew , first pointing , second slew .",
    "during the second pointing , ( from @xmath15 t0 + 166:t0 + 961 s ) xrt data were also collected .",
    "the time intervals during which bat spectra were accumulated are indicated in figure  [ fig : flarelc ] ( b ) with blue horizontal lines .",
    "spectral fitting of the 14 - 100 kev band used a single temperature apec model @xcite with abundances fixed to a multiple of the solar values of @xcite .",
    "the @xcite abundance table was used here for better comparison of our results to other x - ray spectroscopic observations of ev lac , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because the standard apec model included in the xspec distribution only considers emission up to photon energies of 50 kev and the bat energy range extends to 200 kev , we made use of a custom apec model calculated out to a maximum energy bin of 100 kev in order to model correctly the bremsstrahlung contribution at high energies .",
    "based on the results from xrt fitting described below , we fixed the abundance in the apec model used to fit the bat data to @xmath40 in order to facilitate comparison between bat - only and xrt - only spectral fits , the bat data only being able to constrain the product of metallicity and volume emission measure .",
    "figure  [ fig : specpar ] illustrates the variation in plasma temperature , flux , and volume emission measure ( vem ) derived from the bat spectra , and table  [ tbl : batspec ] lists the plasma parameters and errors derived from fitting bat spectra .",
    "the inferred plasma temperature during the first @xmath7100 seconds of bat observations is @xmath712 kev . to estimate the amount of soft x - ray flux during the times",
    "when bat data were collected , we took the best - fit apec model from fits to the bat data and extrapolated to determine the 0.3 - 10 kev flux .",
    "these are indicated in open red circles in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : specpar ] .",
    "the errors shown are 90% confidence intervals , equivalent to @xmath91.6@xmath38 .        in order to investigate spectral evolution during the x - ray flare",
    ", we performed a detailed time - resolved analysis in wt mode .",
    "the statistics in pc mode after pile - up correction are not good enough to allow us to perform a meaningful time - resolved analysis .",
    "we divided the wt data into ten time bins so that we generated in each of the time bins a high statistical quality source spectrum with @xmath41 counts after correcting for pile - up .",
    "the length of the time bins is variable , ranging from 136521 seconds .",
    "note that the inner radius of the annular extraction region used to create the spectra decreases with time since the count rate also decreases and the effects of pile - up become less and less dominant .",
    "all xrt spectra were binned to contain more than 20 counts bin@xmath4 , and were fit from 0.3 to 10 kev within xspec v12.4.0 .",
    "we performed a single temperature fitting of the data using the apec scaled solar abundance model , as well as spectral fits using two discrete temperature ( @xmath42 ) apec components .",
    "the abundances of @xcite are used here as well .",
    "we neglected the absorption column , since the real column towards this very nearby star is probably too low to be very well constrained in the 0.3 - 10 kev band .",
    "the time variations of the derived parameters ( plasma temperature , x - ray flux , volume emission measure , and global metal abundance ) for the @xmath42 fits are shown in figure  [ fig : specpar ] . table  [ tbl : xrtspec ] lists the plasma parameters and their errors derived from fitting the xrt spectra .",
    "although the errors on the derived abundances during the time slices are large , there is no evidence for a significant change in the global metallicity during the flare decay ; for the present purposes we take the abundance @xmath43 to be @xmath7 0.4 .",
    "the quiescent x - ray flux ( 0.57 kev ) from chandra observations is @xmath15 5.8@xmath110@xmath44 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 @xcite , and so the peak measured xrt flux is @xmath7 4200 times this , and even when the flare has declined in flux during the last time bin obtained in pc mode , the flux inferred is still a factor of 10 larger than the chandra value .",
    "the @xmath42 apec spectral fits to the wt mode xrt spectrum obtained from t0 + 171:t0 + 2798 s revealed positive residuals around 6 - 7 kev which look like a line feature not included in the apec line list . to investigate that",
    ", we added a gaussian component to the 2-t apec model .",
    "the resolution of the xrt at 6 kev was @xmath15 140 ev at launch @xcite , but the ccd has experienced degraded resolution since then due mainly to radiation damage .",
    "the rmfs for wt mode data do not contain proper account of this line broadening at high energy due to lack of calibration information .",
    "the width of the gaussian was fixed to a value of @xmath45 kev based on evolution in pc mode data of the line width from the onboard calibration @xmath46fe 5.9 kev line source ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the addition of the gaussian results in a fit improvement of @xmath47 for two parameters and does not change the other fitting parameters .",
    "the line centroid ( @xmath48 kev ) may be consistent with a fluorescence fe k@xmath10 line . note that the fe k@xmath10 fluorescence line is really a doublet with energy separation @xmath712 ev , but this energy difference is small compared with the energy resolution at the time of the observations , and",
    "so our use of a single gaussian with a width of 75 ev , broadened by the instrumental resolution of @xmath7 140 ev is sufficient .",
    "the use of an f - test gives a probability of @xmath49 suggesting that the line is real .",
    "however , @xcite have opined that the f - test should not be used to assess the significance of a line .    to correctly work out the line significance , we used instead monte - carlo simulations based on codes provided by c. hurkett using the posterior predictive @xmath50-value method .",
    "a detailed description of this method can be found in section 3.2 in @xcite . here",
    ", we describe briefly how the codes work .",
    "the steps are : i ) compute the spectral parameters of the model used to fit the data ; ii ) use these parameters with their errors to generate @xmath51 sets of random parameter values and each of these is used to generate a simulated spectrum ; iii ) fit the @xmath51 simulated spectra with the model without a gaussian line and create a table of the @xmath52/d.o.f .",
    "values ; iv ) re - do the same as in iii ) but including a gaussian line , the energy centroid varying around 6.4 kev ( assuming that the feature is due to a fluorescence fe k@xmath10 line ) and the width being fixed at the spectral resolution at the time of the observation ( @xmath53 kev ) . a new table of the @xmath52/d.o.f .",
    "values is created ; v ) compute the @xmath54 distribution from the @xmath51 simulations and compare it with the @xmath54 value obtained from the observed spectrum .",
    "the line significance is then given by the number of times that the simulations produced a @xmath54 value larger than the observed one . in order to work , this method needs to run a large number of simulations ( here , we used @xmath55 ) .",
    "we used the f - test probability to identify which time intervals should be explored further using this method . when the f - test probability is low , the above method will not return a high probability , but is needed in situations where the f - test gives a high probability ; then the posterior predictive @xmath50-value method can determine whether the line is real .",
    "table  [ tbl : fek ] lists the equivalent widths and fluxes of the 6.4 kev feature , along with the results of the f - test and monte carlo simulations .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations for the first six time intervals ; the f - test probability for time bins 7,8 , and 10 were low",
    "so we did not do the additional monte carlo simulations for these intervals .",
    "time bin 9 ( t0 + 2215:t0 + 2517 s ) shows the presence of a line with an f - test probability of 98.5% , so we performed monte carlo simulations for this time interval .",
    "the probability from monte carlo simulations is only 97.3% , which we do not consider significant ( we only considered probabilities @xmath56 99% to be statistically significant ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : kaspec ] shows the k@xmath10 region of the xrt spectrum for the first five time intervals of the flare decay .",
    "the fit of the pc spectrum from @xmath7 t0 + 6.2@xmath57:@xmath7 t0 + 4.3@xmath58s using a two temperature apec model gives a relatively good fit ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the addition of a gaussian line as in the wt spectrum does not improve the fit , not surprising given the much lower flux in this dataset .",
    "this indicates that the k@xmath10 line is not present during this late stage of the flare decay .",
    "the variability of the k@xmath10 line strength is discussed further in  3.6 .",
    "the iron k@xmath10 line is detected in a variety of x - ray emitting stars , from the solar corona to compact stellar objects to actively accreting pre - main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "the formation is generally attributed to a fluorescent process , in which an x - ray continuum source shines on a source of neutral or low ionization states of iron (  ) , photoionizing an inner k shell electron and causing the de - excitation of an electron from a higher level at this energy .",
    "the utility of this line stems from the dependence of the line strength on the solid angle subtended by the source of neutral or near - neutral iron . in the stellar context where the x - ray continuum emission arises from a loop - top source , and the fluorescing material",

    "however , that energy can be released suddenly through explosive magnetic reconnection .",
    "the largest energy flares which can be produced relate to the largest active region size which can exist @xcite .",
    "this flare was an extreme example of instantaneous magnetic energy release , but the radiated energy in the x - ray band is typical of longer duration flares .      while there have been stellar flares detected above 10 kev in the past ( mostly with the bepposax satellite ) , these swift / bat flares ( the one on ev  lac reported here and the superflare on ii peg reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are different in that they were observed using autonomous triggers based on their hard x - ray flux rather than in pointed observations which serendipitously detected large stellar flares .",
    "the two triggered flares differ in several important respects : the maximum plasma temperature achieved was very large in the early stages of the flare on ii  peg ( peaking at @xmath7180 mk ) , and the temperatures measured with both xrt and bat spectra at about 3 minutes past the triggers indicate hotter temperatures for the case of ii  peg versus ev  lac ( 120 mk and 100 mk , respectively ) .",
    "the ii  peg flare had a longer rise time ( 10002000 s ) compared with @xmath37120 s for ev  lac , and while neither flare was observed in its entirety , the decay of the flare on ii  peg had a slower decline than the flare on ev  lac .",
    "some of these differences are likely due to the different stellar environments : ii  peg is a tidally locked binary system consisting of a k subgiant and m dwarf companion with a likely age of a few gyr , while ev  lac is a younger single m dwarf flare star , with a much higher gravity .    at its peak ,",
    "the ev lac flare is @xmath72.5 times ii peg s maximum 14 - 40 kev hard x - ray count rate , and the xrt flux is @xmath7 factor of 4 larger . due to the different distances ( 42 pc for ii  peg vs. 5.06 pc for ev  lac ) , the x - ray luminosity for ii  peg during the peak of that flare was larger , at 1.3@xmath110@xmath131 erg s@xmath4 ( 0.810 kev ) , compared with 6.5@xmath110@xmath23 erg s@xmath4 for ev  lac in the same energy band .",
    "expressed as a fraction of the star s bolometric luminosity , though , the ev  lac flare is larger , with @xmath141/l@xmath6 @xmath15 1.2 , compared to l@xmath142/l@xmath6 = 0.24 for ii  peg . as discussed in  4.1 , up to several times ev  lac s normal bolometric luminosity",
    "may have been radiated at x - ray energies when estimating the soft x - ray flux in the early stages of the flare .",
    "another crucial difference is the existence of additional emission in the hard x - ray band in ii peg , which @xcite interpreted as nonthermal emission ; in the ev  lac flare there is no such evidence .",
    "both flares revealed evidence for fe k@xmath10 6.4 kev emission , but the ev  lac flare sports a larger maximum equivalent width and photon flux . while @xcite described the formation of the k@xmath10 line flux seen in ii  peg as originating entirely from collisional ionization , @xcite showed that a fluorescence interpretation is more likely .",
    "the k@xmath10 line flux shows temporal variations in both flares , and here we interpret the excess k@xmath10 emission as suggestive of the action of nonthermal electrons .    besides the two flares discussed above , two other flares have detections in the 1050 kev band made with bepposax  a flare on the rs  cvn binary ux  ari @xcite , and a flare on algol @xcite .",
    "the common characteristics of these flares were a super - hot temperature ( peak temperatures in excess of 100 mk ) , large x - ray luminosity ( generally @xmath710@xmath140 erg s@xmath4 , in different energy bands ) , and long duration , as measured by the time to decay from peak count rate to half that value ( @xmath7 8 and 12 hours for the algol and ux ari flare , respectively ) .",
    "the flare on ux  ari showed no abundance variations , while the one on algol did show factor of @xmath73 abundance enhancements in the early stages of the flare .",
    "observations of stellar flares with the ginga satellite have detected x - ray emission out to 20 kev in a few large flares .",
    "@xcite found peak temperatures near 100 mk and and emission measures near 10@xmath143 cm@xmath21 from a large flare identified with the m dwarf star eq1839.6 + 8002 , and flare peak temperatures from 6080 mk were determined for flares on the active binaries algol , ux  ari , and ii peg @xcite .",
    "atel # 1689 and # 1718 describe an x - ray transient detected by xmm - newton which may be an m star . with a distance of 400 pc , its peak x - ray luminosity in the 0.210 kev range was 5.5@xmath110@xmath140 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the authors determine the spectral type of the star to be m2/3 , and thus this x - ray flare , if associated with this star , would likely have exceeded its bolometric luminosity ( @xmath710@xmath140 erg s@xmath4 ) .      prior to the large flare discussed in this paper , swift / bat detected lower amplitude hard x - ray transient emission from ev  lac on three occasions which were not strong enough to trigger an autonomous slew .",
    "atel # 1499 describes these .",
    "the peak signal - to - noise ratio in the bat data of the autonomously triggered stellar flare was 19.47 , while two possible events on 6 june 2006 and 20 may 2007 had snr of 3.5 and 3.1 sigma , respectively .",
    "an event on 22 april 2008 was a 4.0 sigma detection over 64 seconds , and is a likely flare detection .",
    "ev  lac earlier underwent a large flare which was detected by the asca satellite , discussed by @xcite .",
    "the maximum plasma temperature diagnosed was 6.3 kev ( @xmath15 70 mk ) with a peak x - ray luminosity ( 0.110 kev ) of @xmath710@xmath23 erg s@xmath4 ( 25% of l@xmath6 ) , and radiated energy at x - ray wavelengths ( 0.110 kev ) of 1.5@xmath110@xmath138 erg ( @xmath15 300 times the quiescent level ) . like this flare ,",
    "the one observed by asca was relatively short , with an exponential decay of 1800s , and came from a relatively compact flaring loop ( @xmath1450.5r@xmath66 ) .",
    "visual inspection of the konus - wind data for the time of the flare caught by the asca satellite shows no significant emission , suggesting the flare detected by swift was harder and more luminous in the hard x - ray range .",
    "another key difference between the flares was the presence of significant abundance variations in the asca flare ( factor of @xmath156 between maximum and minimum @xmath43 )",
    ". a moderate flare on ev  lac seen with the suzaku x - ray telescope lasting 1500s was discussed by @xcite . in comparison with the spectrum extracted outside of flaring intervals , the abundance during",
    "the flare appears to have increased by factors of several .",
    "this behavior is similar to what was observed in the large asca flare .",
    "@xcite discussed a flare seen on ev  lac in the rosat all - sky survey which lasted 24 hours , with a peak temperature near 25 mk .",
    "numerous small flares have also been observed with chandra  @xcite described nine small flares , with highest temperatures near 30 mk , and @xcite discussed another chandra observation exhibiting numerous low - level flares .",
    "the determination of coronal length scales provides an important constraint on the energetics and dynamics of coronal processes .",
    "the use of hydrodynamic modelling to describe the variation of plasma temperature and volume emission measure through the flare decay phase allows an estimate of the coronal loop length to be made , assuming that a single flaring loop dominates the emission . likewise",
    ", the detection of the fe k@xmath10 line allows a constraint to be made on the height above the surface of a coronal loop illuminating the cold iron which fluoresces to form the k@xmath10 line .",
    "while the hydrodynamic modelling explicitly assumes that a single loop is involved in the flare , the k@xmath10 emission line strength depends mainly on the height .",
    "the fact that the two are consistent to within a factor of a few suggests that the former assumption is roughly consistent with the data .",
    "loop lengths derived from an analysis of the time variation of flare light curves in conjunction with variation of temperature and emission measure using hydrodynamical modelling of decaying flaring loops indicates relatively short loops for two large flares observed on ev  lac : @xcite derive a loop semi - length @xmath96 of @xmath70.5r@xmath66 during a large flare seen with the asca satellite , while in the present case a comparable loop length is derived , @xmath146 0.37r@xmath66 .",
    "another method to estimate length scales involves resonance scattering in emission lines , where the expected flux of density - insensitive resonance lines in emission departs from that expected under optically thin conditions .",
    "then the scattering length can be deduced if the electron density in the medium is known .",
    "@xcite determined from time - averaged coronal spectra obtained with chandra s hetgs of ev  lac that the ratio of lyman-@xmath10 to lyman-@xmath147 lines of was more than 3@xmath38 below the theoretical value assuming optically thin emission . using an escape probability formalism they estimated a path length of 1.6@xmath110@xmath115 cm ( 0.06r@xmath66 ) for ev  lac s o  vii - emitting material .",
    "such techniques rely upon the measurement of individual lines , which is not possible with the xrt on swift .",
    "these length scales are smaller than those determined for the flaring loop in this case , but are within an order of magnitude .",
    "if we use the flare area determined from the white light flare and assume that this is the area of the foot - point of a single coronal loop , then we can estimate the radius of the coronal loop at the base under the assumption of simple cylindrical loop . from ",
    "3.4 , a @xmath202@xmath110@xmath85 @xmath3 , so dividing by two for a contribution from each foot - point , we arrive at a foot - point radius of @xmath14810@xmath115 cm .",
    "the loop length estimates from  3.5 give a semi - length of @xmath1499.3@xmath110@xmath115 cm , and combining the two gives an aspect ratio @xmath150 of 0.1 .",
    "this is the value commonly assumed in solar flares @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : kalpha ] illustrates the relationship between the x - ray photons , coronal loop , white - light flare emission , and region of k@xmath10 emission .",
    "the plasma volume emission measure ( vem ) contains spatial information through the total volume , which can be used to constrain loop length given an electron density , or used to estimate electron density if a loop length is assumed . with",
    "@xmath10 set equal to 0.1 , the volume can be written as + @xmath151 and the vem as + @xmath152 the peak 0.310 kev vem during this flare was @xmath15 10@xmath143 cm@xmath21 .",
    "if we use the loop length derived from the hydrodynamic modelling to estimate an electron density , and assume that there was only one flaring loop , then an upper limit on n@xmath103 is around 6@xmath110@xmath153 cm , which is quite high .",
    "it is an upper limit on n@xmath103 because the loop length might be more than 9.3@xmath110@xmath115 cm and inclined on the surface , so the loop volume might be larger , and hence the density smaller .",
    "we have no constraint from x - rays on the loop number or cross - section area .",
    "if the number of loops was larger than one , this would not change the observed plasma evolution .      due to their lower luminosity ,",
    "m dwarfs have a habitable zone which is 510 times closer than for a solar - like star .",
    "this decreased distance renders an exoplanet more susceptible to influences by the parent star .",
    "it has already been recognized that flares from dme stars affect the atmospheres of any terrestrial exoplanets through frequent stochastic ionizing radiation @xcite .",
    "we can quantify the effect that the flare being discussed in this paper would have on an exoplanet in the ev lac s habitable zone by comparing it to solar flares using the solar x - ray flare classification . using the spectral model during the trigger observation ( t0 - 39:t0 s )",
    ", we calculate the flux in the 18   ( 1.5412.4 kev ) range , and scale from a distance of 5.06 pc to 0.1 au .",
    "the solar flare classification is @xmath154 w m@xmath121 , and for this flare the scaled flux is 3600 w m@xmath121 , or an x3.6@xmath110@xmath155 . for comparison , the largest solar flare is about x28 .",
    "@xcite also determined that roughly 4% of the ionizing x - ray radiation can penetrate a terrestrial atmosphere , through redistribution into biologically damaging uv radiation . in the flare considered here on ev  lac ,",
    "the x - ray emission was approximately 7000 times the quiescent level during the peak of the flare , suggesting that the uv radiation which a putative terrestrial planet around ev  lac would have experienced was increased by about a factor of 280 due only to the x - rays . since the x - ray flare was accompanied by white light flare , which was a factor of 76 brighter in the uv than the quiescent uv emission , the total increase in the incident radiation on a terrestrial planet would have been @xmath7350 times larger",
    ".    the uv flux from a parent star can affect the evolution of a terrestrial planetary atmsophere , and can be both damaging and necessary for biogenic processes on a terrestrial planet .",
    "@xcite defined a uv habitable zone which balances these two competing pressures , and found that for inactive m stars the uv habitable zone was closer to the parent star than the traditional liquid water habitable zone . during moderate flares",
    ", however , the temporary increase in uv radiation made the two habitable zones overlap , suggesting that there may be a beneficial role for frequent , moderate sized flares in supporting habitability on exoplanets around m stars .",
    "the computation of habitable zone distance is partly determined by the star s bolometric flux .",
    "the extreme flare here represents a case of a transient increase in the star s bolometric flux , with an energy distribution significantly blue - ward of the quiescent spectral energy distribution .",
    "although this magnitude of flare is likely rare , it likely represents the `` tip of the iceberg '' of a whole ensemble of more frequent but less energetic flares whose integrated emission may change the time - averaged bolometric luminosity over the value estimated from the luminosity in the visual band using the standard bolometric correction .",
    "this is an additional factor which may influence habitable zone distances for m stars .",
    "future attempts to characterize the habitability of exoplanets around m stars should take into account the influence of such extreme events .",
    "the flare studied in this paper is unique in two main aspects : the level of x - ray radiation marks it as one of the most extreme flares yet observed in terms of the enhancement of @xmath77000 compared to the usual emission levels , and it is one of only a handful of stellar flares from normal stars without disks to exhibit the fe k@xmath10 line , with a maximum equivalent width of @xmath56200 ev .",
    "it is somewhat ironic that although early explanations for the source of grbs considered gamma ray emission from flare stars @xcite , they were quickly swept aside due to the extreme nature of the events needed and the apparent discontinuity with the population of observed stellar flares .",
    "now that gamma - ray burst detectors have become more sensitive , we are indeed finding a small population of very energetic stellar flares which produce transient hard x - ray flux at levels consistent with those seen from extragalactic grbs .",
    "these highly luminous events do appear to share characteristics with lower amplitude flares , and are likely an extension of the same underlying energy release processes .",
    "thus , the fact that these flares exhibit fe k@xmath10 line emission and evidence ( both direct and indirect ) for the existence of nonthermal hard x - ray emission does not imply that there is something special about these flares ; stated in the solar physics literature as the `` big flare syndrome '' @xcite , the larger the energy release , the more likely one is to see different flare energy manifestations .",
    "perhaps , the most interesting finding is the detection of fe k@xmath10 line emission , as its presence in the x - ray spectra of normal stars without disks gives an independent constraint on the height of flaring coronal loops , and provides a consistency check with results from flare hydrodynamic models . as previous attempts to characterize the length of flaring loops using different theoretical methods has led to different values @xcite , the use of independent methods is an extremely useful ` sanity check ' on these models .",
    "the detection of fe k@xmath10 line emission in flares from normal stars is even more interesting in light of its utility in understanding the formation of this line in young stellar objects , where the possible presence of a disk complicates the interpretation . in young stellar objects ,",
    "the fe k@xmath10 line is somewhat more commonly detected , but due to the often unknown nature of disk geometry around these stars , the interpretation of the strength of the emission is more ambiguous .",
    "indeed , @xcite determined that the observed fe k@xmath10 line strength in one young stellar object exceeded that allowed either by fluorescence or disk emission , and suggested the presence of nonthermal electrons in the star - disk interaction .",
    "the advantage of the swift - triggered stellar flares is not only their high intensity which allows for the detection of this line , but the ability to study the line flux variability at high time resolution , along with simultaneous constraints on the hard x - ray flux level .",
    "the size of the flare , in terms of its peak x - ray luminosity exceeding the non - flaring stellar bolometric luminosity , is impressive .",
    "the existence of such flares can provide important constraints on the time - scales for energy storage and release in a stellar context .",
    "the multi - wavelength observations which comprise this flare study have enabled the determination of both the rise time of the flare ( konus / wind and swift / bat constraints ) as well as the photospheric contribution to the flare at early times ( swift / uvot @xmath28 and @xmath29 filter constraints ) .",
    "while more extreme stellar white - light flares have been observed from other m dwarf stars , the combination of the uv , optical , soft and hard x - ray measurements were key for determining the possible contribution of nonthermal electron beams to the fe k@xmath10 line flux , and confirming the self - consistency of this explanation by estimation of nonthermal beam fluxes .",
    "while we find only indirect evidence for the role of nonthermal electrons in affecting the x - ray spectrum during stellar flares , this work bolsters conclusions from other authors that additional processes affect stellar x - ray spectra beyond the usual contributions of optically thin thermal emission in collisional ionization equilibrium . the x - ray to optical flux ratios seen in the early stages of the flare will hopefully be useful in constraining the contribution of flaring m stars to the population of unidentified transient hard x - ray sources .",
    "the frequency of occurrence of flares of this magnitude is unknown , but they may be an important factor in determining the habitability of planets around m dwarfs , as even a single occurrence of such a large radiative release can have disastrous consequences for terrestrial - like atmospheres on exoplanets orbiting m stars . as progress is made on identifying nearby stars hosting exoplanets , and because of the renewed emphasis on m dwarfs as host stars , such studies must be done in parallel with those attempting to understand the detailed nature and distribution as a function of luminosity of the stellar flares themselves .",
    "this work made use of data supplied by the uk swift science data centre at the university of leicester .",
    "the konus - wind experiment is supported by a russian space agency contract and rfbr grant 09 - 02 - 00166a .",
