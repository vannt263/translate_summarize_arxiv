    "the situation is complicated by the fact that , due to overlapping soft and collinear divergences , each order in perturbation theory can give rise to two logarithms , yielding @xmath10 . in this case , resummation is necessary already for @xmath11 . because these logarithms are all generated by the singularities in the amplitude , which always exponentiate , higher powers of the logarithms at any order in the coupling can be predicted based on the singular terms in the first few orders in the loop expansion .",

    "@xcite , where it was shown that if dependence on the kinematic variables is assumed to be single ",
    "logarithmic , there is no possible structure that could appear at three - loops beyond the sum - over - dipoles formula .",
    "this argument is based on eliminating all possible structures using the factorization constraints discussed above , together with bose symmetry , and an additional constraint on the singularity structure in the limit where two hard partons become collinear based on the properties of the splitting amplitude .",

    "logarithmic kinematic dependence is crucial for this argument , and this assumption may well be violated .",

    "we have reviewed recent exciting progress in determining the infrared singularities of on - shell scattering amplitudes in massless non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "it is now firmly established  @xcite that the cusp anomalous dimension has a central role in governing soft singularities of multi - leg amplitudes with an arbitrary number of legs and for a general  @xmath166 .",
    "this role is summarized by a set of differential equations ( [ constraints ] ) constraining the kinematic dependence of the soft anomalous dimension matrix of any amplitude , to any loop order , in an arbitrary colour basis .",

    "<S> we review recent progress in determining the infrared singularity structure of on - shell scattering amplitudes in massless gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple ansatz where soft singularities of any scattering amplitude of massless partons , to any loop order , are written as a sum over colour dipoles , governed by the cusp anomalous dimension . </S>",
    "<S> we explain how this formula was obtained , as the simplest solution to a newly - derived set of equations constraining the singularity structure to all orders . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the physical ideas underlying this derivation : the factorization of soft and collinear modes , the special properties of soft gluon interactions , and the notion of the cusp anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly discuss potential multi - loop contributions going beyond the sum - over - dipoles formula , which can not be excluded at present .    </S>",
