    "information theoretical methods have in recent years played an important role in the study of quantum mechanical systems in two cases : first in the clarification of fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and second in the synthesis of probability densities in position and momentum space .",
    "an important step was the discovery of an entropic uncertainty relation @xcite which for a three - dimensional system has the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the shannon s information entropies in position- and momentum - space and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the density distribution ( dd ) and momentum distribution ( md ) , respectively , normalized to unity .",
    "inequality ( [ s1 ] ) is an information - theoretical uncertainty relation stronger than heisenberg s @xcite and does not depend on the unit of length in measuring @xmath16 and @xmath15 , i.e. the sum @xmath17 is invariant to uniform scaling of coordinates , while the individual entropies @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath0 is that it is a measure of quantum - mechanical uncertainty and represents the information content of a probability distribution , in our case of the nuclear density and momentum distributions",
    ". inequality ( [ s1 ] ) provides a lower bound for @xmath0 which is attained for gaussian wave functions .",
    "information entropies were employed in the past to study quantum - mechanical systems @xcite . recently @xcite we studied the position- and momentum - space information entropies @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , for the densities of various systems : the nucleon dd of nuclei , the valence electron dd of atomic clusters and the dd of trapped bose alkali atoms .",
    "we found that the same functional form @xmath20 for the entropy sum as function of the number of particles @xmath21 holds approximately for the above systems in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite for atomic systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found a link of @xmath0 with the kinetic energy of the system @xmath22 and a relationship of shannon s information entropies in position - space with an experimental quantity i.e. the root mean square ( rms ) radius of nuclei and atomic clusters . in ref .",
    "@xcite we used another definition of information entropy according to phase - space considerations @xcite and we derived an information - theoretic criterion for the quality of a nuclear dd , i.e. the larger @xmath0 the better the quality of nuclear model . in ref .",
    "@xcite the dd , the md and the shannon s information entropies have been calculated for nuclei using three different cluster expansions .",
    "the parameters of the various expressions have been determined by least - squares fit of the theoretical charge form factor to the experimental one .",
    "it was found that the larger the entropy sum the smaller the value of @xmath23 , indicating that the maximal @xmath0 is a criterion of the quality of a given nuclear model according to the maximum entropy principle .",
    "only two exceptions to that rule were found out of many cases examined . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered the single particle states of a nucleon in nuclei , a @xmath24 in hypernuclei and a valence electron in atomic clusters .",
    "we proposed a connection of @xmath0 with the energy @xmath25 of the single particle states . before proceeding ,",
    "it is appropriate to mention that additional applications of entropy have attracted interest in recent years @xcite , but in a different spirit , in nuclear physics problems , such as in analysis of shell model eigenvectors .",
    "however , it is noted that in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors define a correlational entropy .",
    "this is a von neumann entropy , which they apply in the framework of the nuclear shell model . in our case",
    "we use the definition of information entropy according to shannon applied to the density distribution in coordinate , and in momentum space of a nuclear system .    in the present work we focus on the entropy sum @xmath0 of a nucleus using the analytical expressions of the dd and md of refs .",
    "the expressions of those distributions have been found for @xmath1-@xmath2 and @xmath1-@xmath3 shell nuclei using the factor cluster expansion of clark and co - workers @xcite and jastrow correlation function which introduces short range correlations ( src ) .",
    "those expressions depend on the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) parameter and the correlation parameter .",
    "we studied the dependence of @xmath0 on those parameters and we found how this quantity is connected with a fundamental quantity , the rms radius of the nucleus .",
    "finally , we propose a way to determine the correlation parameter of the model using the dependence of @xmath0 on that parameter as well as the linear dependence on the logarithm of the number of nucleons .",
    "the ho parameter is determined equating the theoretical charge rms radius of the nucleus with the experimental one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the general definitions related to the correlated dd , md as well as the dependence of the entropy sum on the correlation parameter are given . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the dependence of the rms radius on the correlation parameter and we give an approximate expression connecting the information entropy sum with the rms radius of the nucleus . in sec .",
    "iv , we present a method for the determination of the correlation parameter from the information entropy sum . finally , in sec .",
    "v , the summary of the present work is given .",
    "a general expression for the one - body density matrix of @xmath26 , @xmath1-@xmath2 and @xmath1-@xmath3 shell nuclei was derived in refs .",
    "@xcite using the factor cluster expansion of ristig , ter low and clark @xcite .",
    "that expression depends on the ho parameter @xmath4 ( @xmath27 ) , the occupation probabilities of the various states and the correlation parameter @xmath5 that comes from the jastrow type correlation function @xmath28 , \\quad r_b = r / b_0 ,   \\label{jastrow}\\ ] ] which introduces short range correlations .",
    "the correlation function @xmath29 for large values of @xmath30 goes to 1 and goes to 0 for @xmath31 .",

    "the values of @xmath4 , @xmath23 and @xmath0 when src are not included ( ho case ) are also shown . from table",
    "ii we can see that there is a systematic behavior of the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the values of @xmath5 are always smaller ( that is large correlations ) in the closed shell nuclei , @xmath101he , @xmath52o , @xmath56ar and @xmath57ca , than in the neighboring open shell ones . it is mentioned that @xmath56ar is treated as 1d closed shell nucleus .",
    "the above behavior indicates that there should be a shell effect in the case of closed shell nuclei for the values of the correlation parameter @xmath5 .",
    "similar behavior was found in ref .",
    "@xcite where the determination of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 were made by individual fit of the theoretical @xmath92 to the experimental one . from the same table we can see that @xmath5 is a monotonically increasing function of the number of nucleons of the closed shell nuclei .",
    "the theoretical @xmath92 with and without src , as well as the experimental ones for various nuclei have been plotted versus the momentum transfer @xmath102 in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "it is remarkable that without fit to the experimental charge form factors , the present method gives good form factors , reproducing the diffraction minima and maxima in the correct place . in nearly all cases ,",
    "the @xmath23 values found with src are better than the corresponding values in the ho case .",
    "however , the assessment of the quality of the calculated form factors should not be based solely on the values of the least - squares errors but also on the fulfillment of the requirement that all the diffraction minima are reproduced in the correct place .",
    "thus , comparing the quality of the form factors calculated in the present method with the ones calculated with the harmonic oscillator model , we can say that the quality of the form factors are considerably better in the former case .",
    "all the diffraction minima ( even the third one which seems to exist in the experimental data of @xmath53 mg , @xmath54si and @xmath55s ) are reproduced in the present method while in the harmonic oscillator model they are not .",
    "we note also that , in the case of the nucleus @xmath56ar there are not experimental data for the form factor .",
    "the exception which appears in @xmath52o , where the value of @xmath23 with src is worse compared with the value of @xmath23 without src , should not be taken as a drawback of the present method .",
    "the reason is that there exist many experimental points at low momentum transfer where the ho model gives good form factor , while there are a few experimental points at high momentum transfers where the present method reproduces these points very well , as well as all the diffraction minima and maxima .",
    "that can be seen in fig .",
    "if the experimental points were distributed uniformly , then the values of @xmath23 calculated within the present method would be smaller than the ones calculated within the ho model .",
    "thus , we should conclude that even in @xmath52o the theoretical @xmath92 calculated within the present method is better than that calculated within the ho model .",
    "it should be noted that in the above analysis , the open shell nuclei , except @xmath51c , have been treated as @xmath59 shell nuclei .",
    "however , the same analysis could be made if they were considered as @xmath59-@xmath76 shell nuclei , provided that the corresponding occupation probabilities of the various states are known .",
    "that analysis was made , as an example , for @xmath56ar , assuming that the occupation probabilities of the various states are : @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 which were found are : @xmath105fm and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the value of the parameter @xmath5 now becomes larger ( less correlations ) than that of the closed shell nucleus @xmath57ca and closer to the values of the open shell nuclei @xmath53 mg and @xmath54si ( see table ii ) .",
    "finally , comparing the values of the information entropy sum , which were calculated with and without src and are displayed in table ii , it is seen that the introduction of src increases the information entropy sum by @xmath107 to @xmath108 in agreement with the simple model of src used in ref . @xcite .",
    "in the present work a systematic study of shannon s information entropy sum @xmath0 has been made for various @xmath26 , @xmath1-@xmath2 and @xmath1-@xmath3 shell nuclei using correlated one - body density matrix which depends on the ho size @xmath4 and the correlation parameter @xmath5 .    it is found that , for all the nuclei we have examined , @xmath0 depends only on @xmath5 through a simple two - parameter relation .",
    "a similar approximate expression holds for the rms radius of the nucleus @xmath70 , measured in units of @xmath4 .",
    "it is found also that a simple relation connects @xmath0 with @xmath70 .    from the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath5 and its linear dependence on the logarithm of the number of nucleons of the nucleus",
    ", the correlation parameter @xmath5 for a nucleus can be determined , provided that there are enough experimental data for two neighboring nuclei .",
    "it is mentioned that , usually , the two parameters of the correlated one - body density matrix are determined for each nucleus by least - squares fit of the theoretical @xmath92 to the experimental . within the present method ,",
    "those parameters are determined even in those cases where there are not any experimental data for the charge form factor as this has been made for the nucleus @xmath56ar .",
    "the only experimental data which are used are the experimental charge rms radius of the nucleus , as well as the experimental charge form factors and rms radii of only two nuclei , those of @xmath50he and @xmath57ca .",
    "the procedure which is followed to determine the parameters of the model is the following : first we determine the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 of eq .",
    "( [ sa-2 ] ) from the experimental data of @xmath101he and @xmath57ca .",
    "thus , the values of @xmath83 for each nucleus are known . from the value of @xmath83 for a particular nucleus and from eq .",
    "( [ sa-1 ] ) we determine the correlation parameter @xmath5 corresponding to each nucleus . from that value of @xmath5 and from eq .",
    "( [ ms-1 ] ) the parameter @xmath4 is determined so that the theoretical rms charge radius to be the experimental one .",
    "it is noted also that , using the sum of the information entropies @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the short range correlation parameter has been determined indirectly , from the density distribution , as well as from the momentum distribution .",
    "this appears to be an interesting feature of the present method , since that parameter is usually determined only from the density distribution .",
    "we would like to mention that `` experimental data '' for the momentum distribution are not directly measured but are obtained by means of y - scaling analysis @xcite and are only known for @xmath50he and @xmath51c .",
    "it would be interesting if the dependence of the information entropy sum on the various parameters could be examined with more sophisticated models , such as the density dependent interactions , and if the present method could be applied for the determination of a parameter of those models .",
