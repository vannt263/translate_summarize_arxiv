    "to find out how the galaxies in the local universe have evolved and formed , more distant galaxies have been sought and studied in detail . as the yellow light of older stars , responsible for most of the stellar mass , shifts out of the optical and nir bands , only the younger , short - lived component of the stellar population can be measured with earth - based telescopes and it becomes difficult to estimate how much mass is contained within the stars of such distant galaxies . to find distant galaxies ,",
    "techniques have been applied which use rest - frame uv light to separate distant from nearby systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are therefore biased towards the strongly star forming galaxies , while it has become clear recently that the more massive galaxies ( m @xmath4 m@xmath5 ) have probably undergone a main period of star formation in the very distant past ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and exhibit low star formation activity already since many gyrs ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mid- and far - ir capabilities of spitzer come to the rescue as they allow us to select distant galaxies independent of their star formation rate and to estimate the stellar mass content more reliably .",
    "still , to determine the redshift and physical properties of these mir selected galaxies , knowledge of rest - frame uv / optical absorption ( and emission ) lines is necessary . especially for galaxies at @xmath6 this is not an easy task as the strongest lines move out of the observed - frame optical wavelength regime , where spectroscopic capabilities are still the most powerful , resulting in a _",
    "redshift desert _ where few spectroscopically confirmed galaxies are known ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "the redshift range of @xmath0 , however , seems to be just the range over which most of the mass in galaxies was built @xcite , as evidenced by the substantial population of old , massive and passive e / s0 galaxies at @xmath7 with minimum formation redshifts of @xmath8 @xcite . in particular , @xcite identified spectroscopically a few galaxies at @xmath9 with redder colours and larger stellar masses ( m @xmath10 10@xmath11 m@xmath5 ) than lyman break galaxies ( m @xmath12 m@xmath5 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the sfrs , morphologies and clustering of these galaxies suggest that they may be the progenitors of the massive @xmath13 ellipticals , but the small sample prevents a full understanding of the global picture . for these reasons ,",
    "we have carried out an eso vlt large program ( p.i .",
    "a.  cimatti ) , called gmass ( the galaxy mass ultra - deep spectroscopic survey ) , to obtain spectra of a sample of massive and/or dusty galaxies in the redshift desert .",
    "the integration times per mask reach up to 32 hours and for some individual galaxies more than 60 hours .",
    "the instrument of choice for this survey was fors2 @xcite , which provides excellent sensitivity around 8000  and is stable enough to combine observations carried out over several months .",
    "fors2 has a field of view of @xmath14 .",
    "the sample was selected within one @xmath14 region ( see fig .",
    "1 ) in the _ chandra deep field south _ @xcite , partly overlapping with the _ k20 field _ @xcite and the _ hubble ultra deep field _ @xcite .",
    "a wealth of multi - wavelength data is available for this field as part of the goods legacy @xcite , from radio to x - ray wavelengths , including deep spitzer observations .",
    "the gmass sample catalog contains all the objects detected in the irac 4.5@xmath3 m image with magnitude @xmath15 .",
    "selection in the 4.5@xmath3 m band provides the best compromise between sensitivity , point spread function , image quality and blending among the four irac bands , takes advantage of the negative k - correction due to the shift of the 1.6@xmath3 m bump into this band ( for @xmath16 objects ) , and provides better sensitivity to stellar masses ( for @xmath17 objects ) and less to dust extinction than the @xmath18 band .",
    "the magnitude limit was driven by the compromise between photometric completeness and sample size .",
    "all of these 1278 @xmath15 objects are also detected in @xmath19 band , with m(@xmath20 ( vega ) , except for two . using the @xmath19 image as detection image , matched photometric catalogs in all available optical bands ( from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) were created and used for the determination of photometric redshifts with hyperz @xcite .",
    "the subsample selected for spectroscopic observations was limited to those objects with @xmath23 and no known ( or planned ) spectroscopic redshift from the other surveys in the cdfs ( amongst others : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the total available time of 145 hours ( including overheads ) was distributed among six masks : three using the blue 300v grism ( exposure times of 12 , 14 , and 15 hours ) and three using the red 300i grism ( exposure times of 11 , 32 , and 30 hours ) with resolutions of 440 and 660 , respectively .",
    "targets had to have magnitudes of @xmath24 to be included in a blue mask or @xmath25 to be included in a red mask .",
    "a total of 205 objects fulfill all requirements , 169 of these were included in the masks . as the objects included in the mask",
    "are selected by geometrical requirements , the observed sample is ( relatively ) unbiased .",
    "remaining slit positions were set to include possibly interesting _ filler _ objects .",
    "the observations were carried out in service mode from august 2004 until december 2005 .",
    "five of the six masks have been reduced and preliminary redshifts have been determined .",
    "the spectra are of excellent quality ; the brighter targets show plenty of absorption lines ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "as a first analysis after extracting the spectra , we have attempted to determine redshifts of the galaxies , currently for the first four masks ( all blue masks and the 11 hour red mask ) .",
    "absorption and , if present , emission lines were fit to the observed features . in all masks",
    "at least a few objects do not show features strong enough to be fitted . for these , a redshift has been determined by cross - correlating with an averaged spectrum of the objects with known redshifts in the same kind of mask ( blue or red ) .",
    "the cross - correlation has also been tested on objects for which features could be identified and the results are consistent . the total number of redshifts determined ( in the first four masks ) is 168 , but some of these are for fillers .",
    "the number of redshifts for the sample of gmass objects with @xmath23 is 102 ( a few of these had reliable spectroscopic redshifts from other surveys ) .",
    "a redshift histogram for the gmass sample is shown in fig .",
    "are the photometric redshifts for all objects ( including those too faint for optical spectroscopy ) , the spectroscopic redshifts for those objects for which it is known ( from the literature and from the gmass project ) and the spectroscopic redshifts determined from gmass spectra only .",
    "the gmass project already contributes 78% to the number of spectroscopically determined redshifts greater than 1.4 in this field .",
    "with the @xmath26 new redshifts @xmath27 and over 200 galaxy spectra expected to be delivered by the gmass project , great progress in the understanding of galaxy formation at @xmath6 is expected to be made .",
    "we will derive the evolution of the rest - frame near - ir luminosity function and density to @xmath28 to a depth one magnitude deeper than previous studies @xcite .",
    "using the wide wavelength coverage of the cdfs field , we are fitting spectral energy distributions ( seds ) up to 8@xmath3 m , which will provide estimates of the stellar masses . using the whole sample",
    ", we will trace the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and thereby @xmath29 to @xmath17 . a detailed morphological analysis ( e.g. , merger fraction , cas parameters , surface brightness profiles ) of the deep acs / hst images of the targets",
    "is currently being carried out .",
    "after identification of different galaxy types from spectroscopy , photometry and morphology , we will study the evolution of their three - dimensional clustering .",
    "finally , we will compare all the obtained results with predictions from current galaxy evolution models .",
    "targets which are too faint in the optical but have a red sed may be followed up with nir spectroscopy .",
