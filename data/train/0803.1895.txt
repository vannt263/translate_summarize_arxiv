    "the fermi surface of a metal is a surface of constant energy in momentum space ( @xmath0-space ) that , at absolute zero , separates occupied and unoccupied electron states .",
    "determination of the fermi surface topology of any new metallic compound is an important step toward understanding the physics of the material , since electronic properties depend sensitively on the fermi surface shape .",
    "a powerful experimental fermi surface probe is measurement of the quantum oscillatory magnetization , known as the de haas ",

    "the free electrons of a metal undergo cyclotron motion in real space .",
    "this constrains the @xmath0-space electron states to lie on concentric tubes , called `` landau tubes '' , aligned along the magnetic field direction .",
    "only the segments of tube within the fermi surface contain occupied states ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : landautubes ] ) .",
    "the radius of each tube depends on the strength of the magnetic field , such that as the field is increased , the tubes get larger and successively exit the fermi surface .",
    "as each tube leaves the surface , it rapidly depopulates , causing quantum oscillations in magnetization and other properties .",
    "the quantum oscillations are periodic in @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnetic field strength , with an oscillation frequency proportional to the extremal fermi surface cross - sectional area perpendicular to the magnetic field direction  @xcite : @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the dhva frequency , and @xmath7 is the extremal area . furthermore , as temperature is increased , the fermi surface increasingly blurs , damping out the quantum oscillations .",
    "the damping strength depends on the effective mass of the electrons averaged around the extremal orbit being measured .",
    "thus , dhva measurements performed as a function of temperature and magnetic field direction directly reveal both the topology of the fermi surface and the effective electron masses on the extremal orbits of each fermi surface sheet  @xcite .          for readers new to fermi surface measurements ,",
    "a few definitions are required . since , at zero temperature , the fermi surface separates occupied from unoccupied @xmath0-space states , an _ orbit _ refers to a path along this surface that an electron may trace out under the influence of a magnetic field ; in our case , we are dealing with orbits that not only lie on the constant - energy fermi surface , but on a plane perpendicular to the applied magnetic field as well .",
    "a _ closed orbit _ is one that forms a closed loop around some part of the fermi surface .",
    "an _ extremal orbit _ is a particular closed orbit whose cross - sectional area is either locally maximum or locally minimum , compared to adjacent orbits on the same fermi surface sheet at the same magnetic field angle .",

[ fig : upt3band2 ] , sometimes a fermi surface links up with copies of itself in neighbouring brillouin zones , forming one infinitely large , complicated shape . on such a surface ,",

    "while open orbits can not be detected in quantum oscillation measurements , their presence can be inferred from other experiments , such as angle - resolved magnetoresistance .",

    "an orbit centre and plane would be manually specified , then the algorithm would perform a series of `` stepping '' and `` return - to - surface '' operations as a function of rotation angle around the orbit centre to determine the cross - sectional area via simpsons - rule integration  @xcite .",
    "this approach was later expanded to included trapezoidal - rule integration for orbits which are multivalued at certain angles around the orbit centre  @xcite .",
    "while such an approach works well for when one knows which orbits are extremal ( and the location of the associated orbit centres ) , topologically - complicated fermi surfaces can have extremal orbits that are not obvious from visual examination of the surfaces .",

    "<S> a new algorithm for extracting de haas  van alphen frequencies , effective masses , and electronic density of states contributions from calculated band energies is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm creates an interpolated @xmath0-space `` super cell '' , which is broken into slices perpendicular to the desired magnetic field direction . </S>",
    "<S> fermi surface orbits are located within each slice , and de haas  van alphen frequencies , effective masses and density of states contributions are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> orbits are then matched across slices , and extremal orbits determined . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has been successful in locating extremal orbits not previously noticed in the complicated topology of existing upt@xmath1 band - structure data ; these new orbits agree with experimental de haas  van alphen measurements on this material , and solidify the case for a fully - itinerant model of upt@xmath2 .    </S>",
