    "the present paper extends such a measurement to the case of a 1.3-ghz srf accelerating cavity and also investigates , via numerical simulation , the impact of the the auxiliary couplers on the transfer matrix of the cavity .",
    "these simulations and measurements generally indicate that higher spatial harmonics do not play a significant role for the case of the tesla cavity .",
