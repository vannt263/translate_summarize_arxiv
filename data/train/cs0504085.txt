    "consider communication over a stationary gaussian channel with rayleigh flat fading .",
    "the channel operates in discrete - time , and there is no side information about the channel at either the transmitter or the receiver .",
    "the broad goal is to find or bound the capacity of such a channel .",
    "the approach taken is to consider the capacity per unit energy .",
    "computation of capacity per unit energy is relatively tractable , due to the simple formula of verd @xcite ( also see gallager @xcite ) .",
    "the study of capacity per unit energy naturally leads one in the direction of low snr , since capacity per unit energy is typically achieved at low snr .",
    "however , it is known that to achieve capacity or capacity per unit energy at low snr , the optimal input signal becomes increasingly bursty @xcite . moreover",
    ", such capacity per unit energy becomes the same as for the additive gaussian noise channel , and the correlation function of the fading process does not enter into the capacity .",
    "this is not wholly satisfactory , both because very large burstiness is often not practical , and because one suspects that the correlation function of the fading process is relevant .    to model the practical infeasibility of using large peak powers",
    ", this paper investigates the effect of hard - limiting the energy of each input symbol by some value @xmath0 .",
    "a simple expression is given for the capacity per unit energy under such a peak constraint .",
    "the correlation of the fading process enters into the capacity expression found .",
    "when channel state information is available at the receiver ( coherent channel ) , the capacity per unit energy under a peak constraint evaluates to one nat per joule .",
    "continuous time channels are also considered .",
    "an analogous peak power constraint is imposed on the input signal .",
    "the capacity per unit energy expression is similar to that for the discrete - time channel .",
    "an alternative approach to constraining input signal burstiness is to constrain the fourth moments , or kurtosis , of input signals @xcite .",
    "this suggests evaluating the capacity per unit energy subject to a fourth moment constraint on the input .",
    "we did not pursue the approach because it is not clear how to capture the constraint in the capacity per unit cost framework , whereas a peak constraint simply restricts the input alphabet .",
    "also , a peak constraint is easy to understand , and matches well with popular modulation schemes such as phase modulation . since a peak constraint @xmath1 on a random variable @xmath2 implies @xmath3 \\leq p e[x^2]$ ] , the bound of mdard and gallager @xcite involving fourth moments yields a bound for a peak constraint , as detailed in appendix [ app : fourthegyboundderivation ] .",
    "the results offer some insight into the effect that correlation in the fading process has on the channel capacity .",
    "there has been considerable progress on computation of capacity for fading channels ( see for example telatar @xcite , and marzetta and hochwald @xcite ) .",
    "this paper examines a channel with stationary temporally correlated gaussian fading .",
    "the notion of capacity per unit energy is especially relevant for channels with low signal to noise ratio .",
    "fading channel capacity for high snr has recently been of interest ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the material presented in this paper is related to some of the material in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similarities of this paper to @xcite are that both consider the low snr regime , both have correlated fading , and the correlation of the fading is relevant in the limiting analysis .",
    "an important difference is that @xcite assumes the receiver knows the channel .",
    "other differences are that , here , a peak constraint is imposed , the wideband spectral efficiency is not considered , and the correlation is in time rather than across antennas .",
    "similarities of this paper with @xcite are that both impose a peak constraint , but in @xcite only the limit of vanishingly small peak constraints is considered , and correlated fading random processes are not considered . the papers @xcite and @xcite are also related .",
    "they are more general in that doubly - selective fading is considered , but they do not consider a peak constraint .",

    ", verd @xcite showed that , in the presence of a unique zero - cost symbol in the input alphabet , the capacity per unit cost is given by maximizing a ratio of a divergence expression to the cost function .",
    "the implications of a unique zero - cost input symbol were studied by gallager @xcite in the context of reliability functions per unit cost . in this section , the theory of capacity per unit cost is adapted to fading channels with memory with the cost metric being transmitted energy .",
    "additionally , a peak constraint is imposed on the input alphabet .",
    "consider a single - user discrete - time channel without channel state information at either transmitter or receiver .",
