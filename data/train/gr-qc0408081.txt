    "by providing an analogy between the propagation of light in a curved geometry and the acoustic propagation in a steady , inviscid , transonic barotropic fluid , it has been demonstrated @xcite that the representative fluid posses the signature of an acoustic black hole ( bh hereafter ) embedded by an acoustic horizon at its transonic point ( where the fluid mach number becomes unity ) .",
    "this acoustic horizon emits thermal radiation known as analogue hawking radiation .",
    "the temperature of such radiation is called analogue hawking temperature , or acoustic hawking temperature ( unruh @xcite was the first to propose and compute such a temperature ) . throughout our work",

    "we use the words ` analogue ' , ` acoustic ' and ` sonic ' synonymously in describing the horizons or black holes .",
    "the theory of opens up the possibility to experimentally verify some basic features of bh physics by creating the sonic horizons in the laboratory .",
    "a number of works have been carried out to formulate the condensed matter or optical analogs of event horizons @xcite .",
    "it is also expected that may find important uses in the fields of inflationary models , quantum gravity and sub - planckian models of string theory @xcite .",
    "+ since the publication of the seminal paper by bondi in 1952 @xcite , the transonic behaviour of accreting fluid onto compact astrophysical objects has been extensively studied in the astrophysics community ( including the fast ever paper on curved acoustic geometry by moncrief @xcite ) , and the pioneering work by unruh in 1981 @xcite initiated a substantial number of works in the theory of with diverse fields of application stated above .",
    "no attempt has yet been made to bridge these two categories of research , astrophysical bh accretion and the theory of , by providing a self - consistent study of for real astrophysical fluid flows , i.e. , by establishing the fact that accreting black holes can be considered as a natural example of analogue system . since both the theory of transonic astrophysical accretion and the theory of stem from almost exactly the same physics , the propagation of a transonic fluid with acoustic disturbances embedded into it , it is important to study for transonic accretion onto astrophysical black holes and to compute @xmath0 for such accretion .",
    "+ in this paper we show that a spherically accreting black hole naturally provides a concrete example of analogue system found in nature .",
    "we consider general relativistic ( gr ) spherically symmetric accretion of inviscid polytropic fluid onto a schwarzschild bh of mass @xmath3 .",
    "we first formulate and solve the conservation equations for such accretion and then demonstrate that such flows may become transonic depending on initial boundary conditions .",
    "we then , for the first time , @xcite assumes the positional constancy of sound speed , which may not always be a real physical situation .",
    "this was modified to include the position dependent sound speed by visser @xcite for flat space and by bili@xmath4 @xcite for curved space .",
    "however , none of these papers provides the exact calculation of @xmath5 and related quantities from first principles , and hence the numerical value of @xmath0 in _ any _ existing literature ( even for flat space , let alone curved space ) is obtained using approximate , order of magnitude , calculations only . ] _ completely analytically _ calculate the _ exact _ location of the acoustic horizon @xmath5 @xcite and calculate the quantities on the which are required to compute the surface gravity and @xmath0 for our model .",
    "we then analytically calculate the exact value of @xmath0 in _ curved space time _ for _ all possible _ real physical spherical accretion solutions .",
    "+ it is important to note that the accreting astrophysical bhs are the _ only _ real physical candidates for which both the horizons , actual ( electromagnetic ) and analogue ( sonic ) , may exist together _ simultaneously_. hence our application of to the theory of transonic astrophysical accretion may be useful to compare some properties of these two kind of horizons , by theoretically studying and comparing the behaviour of the _ same _ flow close to these horizons . as an illustrative example of such a procedure",
    ", we also calculate and compare @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the same bh and for the same set of initial boundary conditions , and show that for astrophysically interesting regions of parameter space , @xmath0 may well exceed @xmath1 .",
    "one should , however , note that both @xmath1 and @xmath6 comes out to be quite less compared to the macroscopic classical fluid temperature of accreting matter .",
    "hence bh accretion system may not be a good candidate to allow any observational test for detecting the analogue radiation .",
    "our work rather introduces the most relevant classical system to manifest such analogues in curved space - time .",
    "also we find the possibility that an actual bh event horizon may be embedded by an acoustic white hole .",
    "we take the schwarzschild radius @xmath7 , and scale the radial coordinate @xmath8 in units of @xmath9 , any velocity in units of @xmath10 , and all other physical quantities are scaled accordingly .",
    "we set @xmath11 .",
    "the mass of the accreting fluid is assumed to be much less compared to @xmath3 ( which is usually reality for astrophysical bh accretion ) , so that the gravity field is controlled essentially by @xmath3 only .",

    "we solve eq .",
    "( 6 ) completely analytically by employing the cardano - tartaglia - del ferro technique .",
    "we define : @xmath42 @xmath43{\\sigma_2+\\sqrt{\\sigma_2 ^ 2+\\sigma_1 ^ 3}},~\\ ] ] @xmath44{\\sigma_2-\\sqrt{\\sigma_2 ^ 2+\\sigma_1 ^ 3}},~ \\omega_{\\pm}=\\left(\\omega_1\\pm\\omega_2\\right ) \\eqno{(8)}\\ ] ] so that the three roots for @xmath5 come out to be : @xmath45 @xmath46 however , note that not all @xmath47 would be real for all @xmath41 .",
    "it is easy to show that if @xmath48 , only one root is real ; if @xmath49 , all roots are real and at least two of them are identical ; and if @xmath50 , all roots are real and distinct .",
    "selection of the real physical ( @xmath5 has to be greater than unity ) roots requires the following discussion .",
    "+ although we analytically calculate @xmath5 and other variables at @xmath5 , there is no way that one can analytically calculate the flow variables at any arbitrary @xmath8 .",
    "one needs to integrate eq .",
    "( 6 ) numerically to obtain the transonic profile of the flow for all range of @xmath8 , starting from infinity and ending on to the actual event horizon .",
    "to do so , one must set the appropriate limits on @xmath41 to model the realistic situations encountered in astrophysics . as @xmath14 is scaled in terms of the rest mass energy and",
    "includes the rest mass energy ( @xmath51 corresponds to rest mass energy ) , @xmath52 corresponds to the negative energy accretion state where radiative extraction of rest mass energy from the fluid is required . for such extraction to be made possible , the accreting fluid has to posses viscosity or other dissipative mechanisms , which may violate the lorenzian invariance . on the other hand , although almost any @xmath53 is mathematically allowed , large values of @xmath14 represents flows starting from infinity with extremely high thermal energy , and @xmath54 accretion represents enormously hot ( thermal energy greater than the rest mass energy ) initial ( @xmath55 ) flow configurations , which are not properly conceivable in realistic astrophysical situations .",
    "hence we set @xmath56 .",
    "now , @xmath57 corresponds to isothermal accretion where accreting fluid remains optically thin .",
    "this is the physical lower limit for @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is not realistic in accretion astrophysics .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath60 is possible only for superdense matter with substantially large magnetic field ( which requires the accreting material to be governed by gr magneto - hydrodynamic equations , dealing with which is beyond the scope of this paper ) and direction dependent anisotropic pressure .",
    "we thus set @xmath61 as well , so @xmath41 has the boundaries @xmath62 .",
    "however , one should note that the most preferred values of @xmath58 for realistic bh accretion ranges from @xmath63 to @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "+ coming back to our solution for @xmath5 , we find that for our preferred range of @xmath41 , one _ always _ obtains @xmath50 . hence the roots are always real and three real unequal roots can be computed as : @xmath65 @xmath66 we find that for _ all _ @xmath67 , @xmath68 becomes negative .",
    "we then find that @xmath69 for most values of our astrophysically tuned @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is also found that @xmath70 does not allow steady physical flows to pass through it ; either @xmath18 , or @xmath19 , or both , becomes superluminal before the flow reaches the actual event horizon , or the mach number profile shows intrinsic fluctuations for @xmath71 .",
    "we obtain this information by numerically integrating the complete flow profile passing through @xmath70 .",
    "hence it turns out that we need to concentrate _ only _ on @xmath72 for realistic astrophysical bh accretion .",
    "both large @xmath14 and large @xmath58 enhance the thermal energy of the flow so that the accreting fluid acquires the large radial velocity to overcome @xmath19 only in the close vicinity of the bh . hence @xmath5 anti - correlates with @xmath41 . to obtain @xmath73 and @xmath74 on the",
    ", we apply l hospital s rule to eq .",
    "( 4 ) and we have : @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 @xmath78\\ ] ] @xmath79 @xmath80,~ \\phi_4=\\frac{2\\left(2r_h-1\\right)-\\gamma\\left(4r_h-3\\right ) }         { 4\\left(r_h-1\\right ) } \\eqno{(12)}\\ ] ] the gr description of the sonic geometry for a generalized acoustic metric is provided by bili@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "keeping in the mind that the surface gravity can be obtained by computing the norm of the gradient of the norm of the killing fields evaluated at @xmath5 , we use the methodology developed in bili@xmath4 @xcite to calculate the general relativistic expression for surface gravity , and @xmath0 for our flow geometry is obtained as : @xmath81      \\left|\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(a - u\\right)\\right|_{r = r_h } , \\eqno{(13)}\\ ] ] where the values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are obtained using the system of units and scaling used in our paper .",
    "the stationarity approximation allows us not to discriminate between the acoustic apparent and event horizon .",
    "note again , that , since @xmath5 and other quantities appearing in eq .",
    "( 13 ) are _ analytically _ calculated as a function of @xmath41 , we provide an _ exact analytical value _ of the general relativistic analogue hawking temperature for _ all possible solutions _ of an spherically accreting astrophysical black hole system , something which has never been done in the literature . if @xmath84 , one _ always _ obtains @xmath85 , which indicates the presence of the acoustic white holes at @xmath5 .",
    "this inequality holds good for certain astrophysically relevant range of @xmath41 ; see following discussions .",
    "+ for a particular value of @xmath41 , we now define the quantity @xmath86 to be the ratio of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "this ratio @xmath86 comes out to be independent of the mass of the black hole , which enables us to compare the properties of two kind of horizons ( actual and acoustic ) for an spherically accreting bh with any mass , starting from the primordial holes to the super massive black holes at galactic centers .",
    "note , however , that we applied the analogue to describe the classical perturbation of the fluid in terms of a field satisfying the wave equation on a curved effective geometry .",
    "our main motivation in this paper is not to rigorously demonstrate how the phonon field generated in this system could be made quantized . to accomplish that task",
    ", one can show that the effective action for the acoustic perturbation is equivalent to the field theoretical action in curved space , and the corresponding commutation and dispersion relations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) may directly follow from there .",
    "however , such calculations are beyond the scope of this paper and would be presented elsewhere .",

    "* fig . 2 :",
    "* parameter space classification for @xmath41 for four different sets of values of @xmath0 .",
    "figure 1 shows the dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath41 .",
    "the dependence is highly nonlinear .",
    "we plot @xmath86 corresponding to the black hole solutions only ( solutions for which @xmath88 ) . note that @xmath89 for some @xmath41 . in figure 2 ,",
    "we scan the complete @xmath41 space by depicting its four important non - overlapping regions . for accretion with @xmath41 taken from the lightly shaded regions marked by @xmath90 , the hawking temperature dominates over its analogue counterpart . for high @xmath58 , high @xmath14 flow ( ` hot ' accretion ) ,",
    "becomes the dominant process compared to the actual hawking radiation ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "for low @xmath14 and intermediate / high @xmath58 , acoustic white holes appear ( white region marked by * wh * , where @xmath91 at @xmath5 ) .",
    "for @xmath41 belonging to this region , one obtains outflow ( outgoing solutions with mach number increasing with increase of @xmath8 ) only .",
    "this has also been verified by obtaining the complete flow profile by integrating eq .",
    "the dark shaded region ( lower right corner of the figure ) represents @xmath41 for which @xmath5 comes out to be physical ( @xmath92 ) but @xmath93 becomes negative , hence @xmath94 and @xmath83 are not real and @xmath0 becomes imaginary .",
    "note that both @xmath89 and white hole regions are obtained even for @xmath95 , which is the range of values of @xmath58 for most realistic flows of matter around astrophysical black holes .",
    "_ hence we have shown that the domination of the analogue hawking temperature over the actual hawking temperature and the emergence of analogue white holes are real astrophysical phenomena_. we did not perform formal stability analysis on white hole solutions .",
    "it may be possible that the white hole solutions are unstable , according to the recent proposal that the sonic white holes posses intrinsic instability @xcite . however , such detailed investigations are beyond the scope of this paper and we would like to defer it for our future work .",
    "in this paper we have studied spherically symmetric accretion onto astrophysical black holes as a natural example of analogue system .",
    "if accreting matter contains non - zero intrinsic angular momentum density , accretion becomes axisymmetric and forms disc like structure surrounding the black hole .",
    "calculations presented in this paper may be extended for astrophysical bh accretion discs as well .",
    "bili@xmath4 @xcite studied the relativistic acoustic geometry for 2d axisymmetric space time and one can use such formalism to study for gr and post - newtonian multi - transonic , rotating , advective bh accretion discs in the similar way as is done in this letter .",
    "viscosity , however , is quite a subtle issue in studying the analogue effects for disc accretion . from the astrophysical point of view , even thirty years after the discovery of standard accretion disc theory , exact modeling of viscous transonic bh accretion , including proper heating and cooling mechanisms is still quite an arduous task , even for newtonian flow , let alone for general relativistic accretion . and from analogue model point of view , viscosity is likely to destroy the lorenzian invariance , and hence the assumptions behind building up an analogue model may not remain that much consistent .",
    "however , there are two possibilities through which the calculations presented in the paper may be translated onto the idea of disc accretion .",
    "firstly , one can study the disc system in its weak viscosity limit . secondly ,",
    "if viscosity is present , one can calculate the ratio of the in - fall to viscous time scale to see at which length scale the ratio comes out to be less than one . at that length scale",
    ", accretion acquires such a high radial in - fall velocity ( measured on the equatorial plane of the disc ) that the residence time of matter at a particular annulus of the disc becomes quite low and hence the angular momentum transport may become inefficient . so the flow may practically be taken as inviscid in that length scale .",
    "now if it is found that the length scale at which the sonic horizon is formed , is more or less comparable or less than the length scale where viscosity becomes insignificant , then it should not be any problem in studying the analogue model even for disc accretion .",
    "the whole parameter space for which one can model the analogue process using accretion disc , will then depend on the accretion parameters for which the acoustic horizon forms at a distance equal to or less than the radial distance where the in - fall time scale is smaller compared to the viscous time scale .",
    "our preliminary calculations show that _ indeed _ there are situations for which the above condition is self - consistently satisfied .",
    "such calculations are in progress and will be presented elsewhere .",
