    "most relevant in the context of this paper are gems observations of the spatially unresolved continuum emission from blazar jets , because blazars are very bright x - ray sources .",
    "two classes of objects are of particular interest .",
    "flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and low frequency and intermediate frequency peaked bl lac objects ( lbls and ibls ) with energy spectra with a @xmath256-peak in the ir / optical / uv band and one in the mev to gev band , and high frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) with one @xmath256-peak in the uv / x - ray band and one in the gev / tev band ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for compilations of spectral energy distributions ) .",
    "in the case of hbls ( e.g.  the x - ray bright sources mrk 421 , mrk 501 , 1es1959 + 650 , pks 2155 - 314 , and pks 1218 + 304 ) , gems will sample the low - energy emission component , presumably of synchrotron origin .",
    "optical blazar observations exhibit rather high polarization degrees , often close to the theoretical maximum @xmath213 for synchrotron emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if x - ray emission from hbls is also synchrotron emission , a commonly made assumption , gems observations should reveal x - ray polarization degrees and directions similar to those observed in the optical band .",
    "indeed , the polarization degrees could be even higher , as x - ray emitting electrons radiatively loose their energy on shorter time scales than optically emitting electrons .",
    "as the x - ray emitting electrons have thus less time to travel away from the acceleration sites , the x - ray bright regions are expected to be smaller than the optically bright regions .",
    "the more uniform magnetic field in the smaller x - ray bright regions should lead to a higher polarization degree of the synchrotron emission .",
    "the same reasoning suggests the possibility that continuous swings of the polarization direction as occasionally observed in the optical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , might be observed more often in the x - ray band .",
    "the polarization swings have been interpreted to arise from the movement of a helical magnetic field which threads the jet through stationary shocks @xcite .",
    "thus , gems has the potential to deliver observational evidence for a helical magnetic field at the bases of jets , a prediction of magnetic models of jet formation , acceleration , and collimation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    for fsrqs (",
    "e.g.  the bright sources 3c  279 , s  52116 + 81 , and 1es  0836 + 710 ) , lbls ( e.g.  the bright sources bl lac , on 231 , and oj 287 ) , and some ibls , gems will sample the high - energy @xmath256-component , presumably of inverse compton origin , and can be used to constrain the origin of this component . if the emission is of ssc origin , the inverse compton emission should track the polarization degree and polarization direction of the synchrotron emission .",
    "figures [ f : tp07 - 1 ] and [ f : tp07 - 2 ] show that the ssc emission can be highly polarized . in external - compton ( ec ) models ,",
    "the dominant target photons come from the accretion disk , from the corona , from the broad line region clouds ( blr ) , or the cmb . as discussed in section  [ s",
    ": thomson ] , unpolarized target photons would result in very low ( @xmath275 ) polarization degrees .",
    "although reflection off the blr clouds would polarize the target photons coming from a particular direction , averaging over an axisymmetric cloud configuration would lead to a low net - polarization of the target photons and thus to a rather low polarization degree of the ec emission .",
    "the detection of high polarization degrees would thus strongly favor a ssc origin of the x - ray emission .",
    "however , the detection of vanishing or low polarization degrees would not exclude the ssc scenario , as the ssc process can produce small polarization degrees if the magnetic field is aligned with the line of sight .",
    "the ssc hypothesis would even be consistent with low polarization degrees observed for many sources , as it can not be excluded that the blazar - zone magnetic field is preferentially aligned with the line of sight .",
    "if the polarization degree is low but non - zero , simultaneous optical / x - ray measurements of the polarization degree and direction should be able to decide between an ssc and an ec origin , as the former predicts a good correlation while the latter does not . in the discussion",
    "so far , we have assumed that the magnetic field , and the target photon and electron distributions do not change over the emission region .",
    "if information about the spatial ( and/or temporal ) distributions of these quantities is available , the polarization degree can be calculated with a calculation similar to equation  ( [ e : sc3 ] ) . in this case",
    ", one needs to integrate the expression in the nominator ( inside the absolute - value brackets ) and in the denominator over the emission volume . inside the integrals , the magnetic field as well as the target photon and electron densities",
    "should be evaluated at the retarded times . as equation  ( [ e : sc3 ] ) gives only @xmath276 , one has to calculate also @xmath277 by replacing @xmath278 in the nominator by @xmath279 .",
    "the polarization direction and degree can then be computed with equations  ( [ e : direction ] ) and ( [ e : degree ] ) , respectively . in most cases ,",
    "a spatial variation of the source properties will lead to a large number of free model parameters , and will render the unambiguous interpretation of observational data more difficult . some of the most interesting gems results may come from observations of polarization degrees close to the maximum theoretically possible polarization degrees , which indicate a uniform emission region and make it possible to constrain models effectively .",
    "the reader interested in non - uniform emission regions should refer to the related discussions of the polarization of synchrotron emission from non - uniform emission regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    the monte carlo approach presented in section [ s : calculations ] can also be used to explore the polarization properties of inverse compton emission in the case that the electron phase space distribution is not isotropic in any frame of reference .",
    "future research could combine the results of general relativistic or newtonian magnetohydrodynamical simulations concerning the structure of blazar jets ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) with the results from particle - in - cell simulations of relativistic shocks ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "monte carlo simulations as described in this paper can then be used to derive observational signatures which can be compared to experimental data .",

    "<S> nasa s small explorer mission gems ( gravity and extreme magnetism smex ) , scheduled for launch in 2014 , will have the sensitivity to detect and measure the linear polarization properties of the 0.5 kev and 2 - 10 kev x - ray emission of a considerable number of galactic and extragalactic sources . </S>",
    "<S> the prospect of sensitive x - ray polarimetry justifies a closer look at the polarization properties of the basic emission mechanisms . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present analytical and numerical calculations of the linear polarization properties of inverse compton scattered radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a generally applicable formalism that can be used to numerically compute the polarization properties in the thomson and klein - nishina regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we use the code to perform for the first time a detailed comparison of numerical results and the earlier analytical results derived by bonometto et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1970 ) for scatterings in the thomson regime . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we use the numerical formalism to scrutinize the polarization properties of synchrotron self - compton emission , and of inverse compton radiation emitted in the klein - nishina regime . we conclude with a discussion of the scientific potential of future gems observations of blazars </S>",
    "<S> . the gems mission will be able to confirm the synchrotron origin of the low - energy emission component from high frequency peaked bl lac objects . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the observations have the potential to decide between a synchrotron self - compton and external - compton origin of the high - energy emission component from flat spectrum radio quasars and low frequency peaked bl lac objects . </S>"
