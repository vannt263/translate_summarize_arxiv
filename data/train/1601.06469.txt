    "<S> we study the coulomb excitation of pygmy dipole resonances ( pdr ) in heavy ion reactions at 100 mev / nucleon and above . </S>",
    "<S> the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are taken as a practical examples . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to address the question of the influence of giant resonances on the pdr as the dynamics of the collision evolves . we show that the coupling to the giant resonances affects considerably the excitation probabilities of the pdr , a result that indicates the need of an improved theoretical treatment of the reaction dynamics at these bombarding energies .    the existence of collective vibrations in neutron - rich nuclei at low energies was suggested by kubono , nomura , and collaborators in a 1987 proposal for the japanese hadron project which eventually became the j - parc facility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this proposal was later given theoretical support by ikeda @xcite and collaborators . </S>",
    "<S> it took nearly two decades for experimental evidences of the existence of a collective low energy response to be found in neutron - rich nuclei , far from the valley of stability . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile mentioning that direct breakup of light and loosely - bound projectiles , such as @xmath2be and @xmath2li were initially thought to be indicative of a collective nuclear response but it was shown to be a direct coulomb dissociation of the weakly - bound valence nucleons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays it is known as the pygmy dipole resonances ( pdr ) , which is the strength at low - lying energies due to the fragmentation of the nuclear response @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum is typically obtained with the experimental probe of choice , i.e. , relativistic coulomb excitation of projectiles produced and accelerated in radioactive beam facilities ( for related reviews , see refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in such a process </S>",
    "<S> , the identification of pygmy resonances is done via their decay modes , usually via gamma or neutron emission , and the energy spectrum is obtained by invariant mass reconstruction from the energy of the fragments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pdrs are typically interpreted as due to the oscillation of the excess neutrons against a more tightly bound core .    </S>",
    "<S> theories for giant resonances date back to when a simple hydrodynamical interpretation of protons oscillating against the neutrons was used @xcite . later on microscopic calculations were developed based on the linear response theory @xcite . nowadays </S>",
    "<S> , an effort is being undertaken to describe nuclear collective motion with more elaborated models such as the time - dependent superfluid local density approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , theoretical studies of the pygmy resonances have been developed based on the improvements of the hydrodynamical model @xcite , and with microscopic theories such as the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and its variants @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when reactions with radioactive beams became the focus of nuclear research in the last decades , it was soon realized that slight modifications of the linear response theory predict a considerable concentration at low energies of the excitation strength in neutron - rich nuclei @xcite . as a word of caution , </S>",
    "<S> the amount of the sum rule exhausted by the nuclear response at low energies strongly depends on how the nuclear interaction , pairing , and other physical phenomena are incorporated in the theory @xcite . as an example , the public code of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has been used to calculate the e1 strength function , defined as @xmath3 defined for an rpa configuration space in terms of delta - function states @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an electromagnetic operator . </S>",
    "<S> a 1 mev smearing of the fragmented strength function is introduced to yield a continuous distribution , shown in figure [ figrpa ] for the e1 response in @xmath6ni . in this case </S>",

    "<S> , the strength function has dimensions of mev@xmath10 and in the long - wavelength approximation , @xmath11 , it is proportional to the usual response for electric multipole operators . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite show a larger response in the pdr energy region due to adaptations in the model space and interactions . as of now </S>",
    "<S> , there is not a clear prediction of the precise location of the pygmy strength . </S>",
    "<S> it could be in the range of @xmath12 mev for medium mass nuclei such as ni isotopes . </S>",

    "<S> one of the effects overseen in the experimental analysis of coulomb excitation of pygmy resonances is the large excitation probability in coulomb excitation at small impact parameters , leading to a strong coupling of pygmy and giant resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling is manifested in dynamical effects such as the modification of transition probabilities and cross sections for the excitation of the pdr . </S>",
    "<S> this has been observed in the past in the context of the excitation of double giant dipole resonances ( dgdr ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of the dgdr in experiments is a consequence of higher - order effects in relativistic coulomb excitation and arises because the large excitation probabilities of giant resonances in heavy ion collisions at small impact parameters . </S>",

    "<S> the pdr centroid energy was found to be at 9.55 mev , with a 2.8% fraction of the trk sum rule , a width of 0.5 mev , and the pdr identification was done by measuring the neutron decay channel of the pdr . in this work our objective is to study the effects of the coupling between the several giant resonances with the pdr , and therefore we will only calculate the excitation function d@xmath43/de without concern for the decay channels .    one needs a model for bound and continuum discretized wavefunctions entering the matrix elements @xmath44 in eq . . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunctions can also be used to calculate the response functions , @xmath45 , with an appropriate sum over angular momentum coefficients . instead of considering numerous nuclear structure models for the wavefunctions and to dwell with the microscopic properties of the pygmy and giant resonances , we assumed lorentzian forms for the response functions </S>",

    "<S> for the ( isovector ) 1@xmath57 giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) we assume @xmath58 mev and @xmath59 mev and for the ( isoscalar ) 2@xmath60 giant quadrupole resonance ( gqr ) we take @xmath61 mev and @xmath62 mev . </S>",

    "<S> the number of channels can also be reduced by a factor of 2 by means of a coarser binning of the pdr and gqr states with a loss of accuracy at the level of 10% . with the number of channels mentioned earlier our calculations converge to within 1% .    in figure [ cc1 ] </S>",

    "<S> the filled circles represent the calculations using first - order perturbation theory , while the filled squares are the results of coupled - channel calculations . as shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , first - order coulomb excitation cross sections can be obtained by means of the relation @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the multipolarity , @xmath67 are the virtual photon numbers , and @xmath68 are the cross sections for real photons with multipolarity @xmath66 . </S>",

    "<S> are shown separately . </S>",
    "<S> because the @xmath69 states in the gdr region are very weakly affected by the coupling to the other states , we left them out of the figure as we want to concentrate on the pdr excitation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the gdr excitation dominates in the high energy region by a factor of @xmath74 times that of the 2@xmath60 states . </S>",
    "<S> the main modifications in the excitation spectrum comes from the couplings @xmath75 by e1 fields , while the couplings @xmath76 by e2 fields contribute very little to the 1@xmath57 states in the pdr energy region . </S>",
    "<S> we also see in figure [ cc1 ] that the tails of the pdr , and to a minor extent those of the gqr , are appreciably modified </S>",
    "<S> . a small shift of the peaks also occurs , although barely visible for the pdr , it is evident for the gqr . </S>",
    "<S> one has to keep in mind that the low energy tail of the gdr will modify the strength and shape of the pdr . </S>",
    "<S> for the case we consider here , a gdr strength of the order of 3.8% lies in the region of the pdr and the pdr shape with only slightly be influenced by this low energy tail . </S>",
    "<S> however , these effects have been considered in the experimental analyses @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the higher - order effects which have been so far ignored .    </S>",
    "<S> in figure [ cc2 ] we singled out the energy region of the pygmy resonance and we plot the results of our calculations for two different bombarding energies : 100 mev / nucleon and 2 gev / nucleon , with the same notation as in figure [ cc1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling effects change dramatically . at the lower energy </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the giant resonances is to increase appreciably the response in the energy region of the pdr , while at the higher energy the effect of coupling is much smaller and the tendency is to slightly decrease the pdr excitation cross section . </S>",
    "<S> this result is expected because at energies around 100 mev / nucleon the e2 field is dominant , with an appreciable increase of the excitation of the gqr and a consequently strong feedback to the pdr via subsequent e1 transitions .    </S>",

    "<S> the filled circles represent the calculations using first - order perturbation theory , while the filled squares are the results of coupled - channel calculations . ]    in figure [ cs ] we show the coulomb excitation cross sections of the pdr as a function of the bombarding energy of @xmath6ni projectiles incident on @xmath13au targets . </S>",
    "<S> the filled circles represent the calculations using first - order perturbation theory , while the filled squares are the results of coupled - channel calculations . at lower energies </S>",
    "<S> the deviation is clearly more pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> at 600 mev / nucleon the cross section for excitation of the pdr changes from 80.9 mb obtained with the virtual photon method to 92.2 mb with the coupled - channels calculation . </S>",
    "<S> if this is reflected in the extracted pdr strength from the experimental data , it amounts to an appreciable change of 14% . </S>",
    "<S> it implies a reduction by approximately the same amount of the strength needed to reproduce the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed calculations for @xmath1 at 503 mev / nucleon , corresponding to the experiment of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb excitation cross section for the pdr in @xmath6ni to first - order is found to be 58.3 mb , while when couplings to the giant resonances are included , the cross section increases to 71.2 mb , i.e. , an important 18.1% correction . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole polarizability is defined by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the photo - absorption cross section . the value of @xmath79 extracted from the experiment in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is @xmath80 @xmath81 while to reproduce the experimental cross section with our dynamical calculations we have @xmath82 @xmath81 , a small but non - negligible correction . if a linear relationship between the dipole polarizability and the neutron skin is assumed @xcite , a reduction of the neutron skin from 0.17 fm , as reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , to 0.16 fm is to be expected . </S>",
    "<S> such a correction still lies within the experimental uncertainty of 7% for @xmath79 and 0.02 fm for the neutron skin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , coupling effects should be taken into consideration in the future when more precise data will become available , in particular , if the measurement is performed at lower bombarding energies .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that due to the large coulomb excitation probabilities of giant resonances in heavy ion collisions at energies around and above 100 mev / nucleon , the excitation of the pdr is also appreciably modified due to the coupling between the @xmath69 and @xmath70 states . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are simplified with the use of a lorentz - like distribution of the electromagnetic response and sum - rules , without a detailed nuclear structure model . in the future it might be possible to carry out nearly  ab - initio \" calculations based on a microscopic theory , coupled with a proper reaction mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> a known alternative , already used in previous studies of multiphonon resonances @xcite , is to use individual states calculated with the rpa or other microscopic models together with higher order perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> finally , one might also use advanced mean - field time - dependent method such as that developed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance to derive rather accurate dipole strength distributions from electromagnetic excitation of the pdr is mainly due to the extraction of the dipole polarizability @xcite , which is an important observable to constrain the symmetry energy , and is thus also important for the understanding of neutron - star properties . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy response is particularly important for the polarizability due to the inverse weighting with energy . </S>",
    "<S> this opens really exciting possibilities for the studies of the pygmy resonance in nuclei and use it as a tool for applications in nuclear astrophysics . </S>"
