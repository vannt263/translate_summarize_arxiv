    "although the structure of the proof parallels that of speyer for the octahedron recurrence , the combinatorial objects which we produce are quite different .",
    "it is worth noticing that the cube recurrence can be written in a slightly more symmetric fashion : the families of functions @xmath14 satisfying the cube recurrence can be made to correspond to the families @xmath15 satisfying the recurrence @xmath16 by taking @xmath17 when @xmath18 , @xmath19 otherwise . this latter equation has the esthetic advantage of being invariant not only under translation and permutation of coordinates but also under reflections ( e.g. the substitution @xmath20 ) . however , we will not make further use of it here .",

    ", we need only observe that no two distinct long edges can be represented by the same edge variable .",
    "for example , if @xmath122 represented both @xmath85 and @xmath123 with @xmath124 , then @xmath125 , so @xmath126 and @xmath127 , but also @xmath128 , a contradiction .    at this point we are prepared to state our main theorem .",

    "because each monomial @xmath121 in turn determines @xmath92 uniquely , we see that we obtain the same set of radius-@xmath73 groves regardless of the choice of cutoff @xmath73 . consequently , in all subsequent discussion ( except the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] itself )",
    ", we may drop the @xmath73 and simply use the term `` grove , '' or `` @xmath55-grove '' if the choice of @xmath55 is ambiguous .    before proceeding ,",
    "we make one basic observation about the structure of groves that is not necessarily apparent from the definition .",
    "[ acyclic ] every grove is acyclic .",
    "the proof will require one preliminary result . let @xmath132 .",
    "we then have    [ rhombcount ] the set @xmath133 consists of @xmath134 points and contains exactly @xmath135 rhombi .",
    "the proof is deferred , as it will use the same technique as the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] .",
    "let @xmath92 be a grove on the initial conditions @xmath55 ; we begin by proving that @xmath136 , the induced subgraph on @xmath133 , is acyclic .",
    "we claim that if any two vertices of @xmath133 lie in the same component of @xmath92 , they are connected by a path contained in @xmath133 . for suppose not ; choose two vertices connected by a path ( which we may assume to have no repeated vertices ) not contained in @xmath133 .",
    "choose a vertex @xmath9 of this path with @xmath137 minimal ; in particular , @xmath138 , and @xmath9 is not an endpoint of the path . because @xmath73 is a cutoff , @xmath77 ;",
    "assume without loss of generality @xmath139 .",
    "then @xmath140 belongs only to the rhombi @xmath141 , each of which ( by compactness ) contributes to @xmath92 the edge not incident to @xmath140 ; @xmath142 , which contributes the edge @xmath143 , which can not be used in the path ( by minimality ) ; and @xmath144 , which contributes the edge @xmath145 .",
    "hence , only one edge incident to @xmath140 may be used in the path , contradicting the assumption of no repeated vertices .",
    "the claim follows .",
    "hence , every component of @xmath92 that contains any vertex of @xmath133 induces a single component of @xmath136 .    now consider the following classes of vertices in @xmath133 :    * @xmath94 , and @xmath95 for all @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 ; * @xmath99 for @xmath100 ; * @xmath101 , and @xmath102 for @xmath146 .    by the foregoing and connectivity for @xmath92 ,",
    "each class is contained in a single component of @xmath136 , and certainly no component may contain vertices of more than one class ( otherwise the corresponding component of @xmath92 would , which is impossible ) .",
    "we also claim that every component of @xmath136 contains one of the above classes of vertices ; it suffices to show that the corresponding component of @xmath92 contains some vertex @xmath9 with @xmath147 . if not ,",
    "then by the connectivity condition , this component of @xmath92 must contain some vertex @xmath9 with @xmath148 .",
    "but it is impossible for such a vertex to be connected to a vertex of @xmath133 by a path not going through any point @xmath9 with @xmath147 , since the sum of coordinates changes by at most two at each step along the path .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "we therefore conclude that the components of @xmath136 are in bijection with our classes of vertices , of which there are @xmath149 . on the other hand , by lemma [ rhombcount ] ( and the complementarity condition ) , @xmath136 has @xmath150 vertices and @xmath151 edges , for a minimum of @xmath152 components , with equality only if @xmath136 is acyclic .",
    "equality does hold , so @xmath136 is acyclic , as claimed .    now",
    ", suppose @xmath92 contains some cycle . since the definition of a grove is independent of the choice of cutoff @xmath73 , we may choose @xmath73 large enough so that all the vertices of the cycle belong to @xmath133 .",
    "then the induced subgraph @xmath136 contains a cycle , and this is a contradiction .",
    "hence , @xmath92 is acyclic .",
    "the definition of a grove we have presented is somewhat cumbersome . for purposes of empirical investigation , infinite graphs are inconvenient to work with ; groves as defined above also contain , in a certain sense , redundant information .",
    "we therefore will present  in slightly less detail  a simplification which we have at times found intuitively more useful , in the hope that it will also prove more practical for later investigations .    by projecting onto the plane @xmath153 ,",
    "we can reinterpret groves as graphs on the infinite triangular lattice .",
    "it is not hard to check that the interiors of distinct rhombi can not overlap in this projection ; this fact , in conjunction with the complementarity requirement , ensures that the resulting graphs are planar .",
    "we can define a point @xmath2 to be _ even _ or _ odd _ depending on the parity of @xmath154 .",
    "every rhombus then has two even vertices and two odd vertices , and the edge used in @xmath92 connects two vertices of the same parity ( and so can also be called _ even _ or _ odd _ ) .",
    "it follows that , given `` half '' of a grove , we can uniquely reconstruct the other half : if we know which even edges are used in @xmath92 , the remaining edges must be precisely the odd edges of those rhombi whose even edges are not used .",
    "finally , we can restrict our attention to a finite piece of @xmath55 , since , whenever a vertex @xmath9 satisfies @xmath109 , we know precisely which edges are incident to it , by the compactness condition . putting all these observations together",
    ", we define a _ simplified grove within radius @xmath73 _ , where @xmath73 is a cutoff for @xmath55 and furthermore is odd , to be a subgraph @xmath155 of @xmath88 satisfying :    * ( vertex set ) the vertex set of @xmath155 is @xmath156 ; * ( acyclicity ) @xmath155 is acyclic ; * ( connectivity ) the _ even boundary vertices _",
    "@xmath157 @xmath158 can be partitioned into the following sets so that each component of @xmath155 contains exactly one set , and conversely , each set is contained in some component : * * @xmath159 , and @xmath160 for @xmath97 , @xmath161 ; * * @xmath162 , * * @xmath163 , and @xmath164 .    for any grove @xmath92 ,",
    "the induced subgraph on @xmath165 is then a simplified grove .",
    "( an example of a grove and the corresponding simplified grove , with @xmath105 , is shown in figure [ simpgrov ] ; the vertices circled on the left side of the figure are those belonging to the vertex set of the simplified grove . ) the only condition that is not entirely evident is connectivity , which follows from the connectivity condition on @xmath92 , with a slight bit of subtlety : we must check that , in the grove @xmath92 , a path connecting any two even boundary vertices as specified by connectivity is in fact contained in the vertex set of @xmath155 .",
    "however , the requirement that all vertices on the path be even poses no difficulty , as even vertices are connected only to even vertices ; and the verification that all vertices @xmath9 on the path satisfy @xmath166 is precisely as described in the proof of theorem [ acyclic ] .",
    "[ simpgrov ]    we next show the converse of the above  every simplified grove is induced by a unique grove .",
    "given a simplified grove @xmath155 , we again let @xmath132 .",
    "we extend @xmath155 to a graph @xmath92 on all of @xmath55 as follows : for every rhombus contained in @xmath133 whose even edge does not appear in @xmath155 , we include the odd edge instead ; we then include the short edges of all other rhombi in @xmath55 . in view of the complementarity and compactness conditions , the resulting graph is the only possible grove on @xmath55 that induces the simplified grove @xmath155 .",
    "we claim that this @xmath92 is indeed a grove .",
    "all the conditions except connectivity are immediate ; this last is a bit more involved .",
    "we first show that our graph @xmath136 on the vertex set @xmath133 , obtained by including the appropriate odd edges , is acyclic .",
    "it can not have any cycles on even vertices , as such a cycle would already have existed in @xmath155 . if there is a cycle on the odd vertices , then it is not hard to see that its planar projection must enclose some even vertices of @xmath133 but can not enclose any even boundary vertices . by planarity ,",
    "then , @xmath155 has some vertices that can not be connected to any even boundary vertices , violating its connectivity requirement .",
    "thus , no cycles have been introduced in @xmath133 .",
    "now we again apply the component - counting technique . from connectivity for a simplified grove",
    ", we can check that there are always @xmath167 components .",
    "if we consider the graph @xmath136 , lemma [ rhombcount ] tells us that we have @xmath135 edges and @xmath168 vertices ; since the graph is acyclic , it has @xmath169 components . in particular",
    ", there are @xmath170 components on the odd vertices .",
    "now divide the _ odd boundary vertices _ @xmath171 into classes according to connectivity for a grove : we have the classes @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath160 for @xmath174 , as well as @xmath175 .",
    "we thus get @xmath170 classes .",
    "moreover , we claim that , in our graph on @xmath55 , no two odd boundary vertices from different classes can lie in the same component . to see this , we consider the paths of @xmath155 connecting the even boundary vertices , together with the extra short edges emanating from them ( given by the compactness condition ) , and project into the plane .",
    "these paths divide the plane into sectors , each of which contains the odd boundary vertices of ( at most ) one class . if any two odd boundary vertices from different classes lie in the same component of @xmath92 , the path connecting them must intersect one of the paths on even vertices . however , the two paths can not intersect at an actual vertex , since one path uses only even vertices and the other uses only odd vertices .",
    "this violates planarity .",
    "this argument is shown in figure [ esectors ] .",
    "the solid wavy lines represent paths between even boundary vertices , as specified by simplified - grove connectivity ; the odd boundary vertices are circled , and the dashed wavy lines show all possible connectivities that can occur between them without violating planarity .",
    "these are precisely the connectivities required for a grove .        at this point",
    "we have shown that , for any component of @xmath92  and so for any component of @xmath136  the odd boundary vertices it contains all belong to the same class . since we have @xmath170 classes , we get at least @xmath170 components of @xmath136 on odd vertices .",
    "but we have already shown that equality occurs .",
    "this is only possible if , for each class , all its vertices belong to the same component , and every component contains one such class of vertices .",
    "we may now conclude that each class of vertices required for a grove is contained in some component of @xmath92 : either the class consists of odd boundary vertices , and we have just proven that they are connected ; it consists of even boundary vertices , and the conclusion follows from connectivity for @xmath155 ; or it consists of a single vertex outside of @xmath133 , and the conclusion is trivial .",
    "conversely , consider any component of @xmath92 .",
    "if it contains any vertex of @xmath133 , it either contains odd vertices , and then ( as we have just seen ) it contains an entire class of odd boundary vertices , or it contains an even vertex , and then ( by connectivity for @xmath155 ) it contains an entire class of even boundary vertices .",
    "moreover , no two boundary vertices from different classes may be connected within @xmath133 , and the extra short edges can not introduce any new such connectivities ( by the argument in the proof of theorem [ acyclic ] ) ; thus , no component of @xmath92 contains more than one class of boundary vertices . on the other hand ,",
    "if our component of @xmath92 does not contain any vertex of @xmath133 , then it is a chain of short edges and contains exactly one vertex of the form @xmath176 , @xmath177 , or @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "every such vertex lies in a component of @xmath92 consisting entirely of short edges , which can not intersect @xmath133 and therefore contains none of the classes of boundary vertices .",
    "thus , each component of @xmath92 contains exactly one class of vertices .",
    "we now have verified that the grove connectivity condition is met in its entirety .",
    "this completes the proof that every simplified grove is induced by a unique grove .",
    "we now have established a bijection between groves and simplified groves ( within radius @xmath73 ) , so the latter may be used as a sort of shorthand to represent the former .",
    "before proceeding to the proof of the main theorem , let us continue to assume that it holds and note some consequences . as usual ,",
    "the hypotheses of section [ recursec ] hold , including the assumptions that @xmath58 and @xmath180 , except where stated otherwise .",
    "it is clear that , as a laurent polynomial in @xmath181 , @xmath54 has every coefficient equal to @xmath12  that is , a grove @xmath92 is uniquely determined by the monomial @xmath121 , as already discussed . in @xcite , propp conjectured that , for the initial conditions @xmath182 , every coefficient is still @xmath12 if we set all edge variables equal to 1 and simply view each @xmath1 as a laurent polynomial in the variables @xmath183 .",

    "one proof examines a laurent polynomial with fixed indices under varying initial conditions , as we have done ; the second proof uses fixed initial conditions and evaluates successive polynomials , making use the method of graphical condensation introduced by eric kuo ( e.g. in @xcite ) . briefly stated , the method operates as follows : suppose that we wish to determine the number of matchings of some graph @xmath92 .",
    "we choose some induced subgraph @xmath136 , and we also find several pairs of subgraphs of @xmath92 such that , in each pair , the intersection of the two subgraphs is @xmath136 .",
    "when a perfect matching of @xmath92 and a perfect matching of @xmath136 are superimposed , the result is a multiset of edges of @xmath92 . under suitable conditions , this multiset",
    "can then be decomposed again as a union of matchings of one of our pairs of subgraphs , with possibly some fixed set of additional edges associated with the pair ( independent of the particular matchings ) .",
    "if we can show that , for any such multiset , the number of decompositions into a matching of @xmath92 and a matching of @xmath136 equals the number of decompositions into matchings of one of the other pairs of subgraphs , then we obtain an expression for the number of matchings of @xmath92 in terms of the numbers of matchings of the subgraphs . by associating an appropriate laurent monomial to each matching",
    ", we can obtain a similar statement for matching - counting polynomials .",
    "one would expect an analogous statement to hold true for groves : loosely speaking , by combining the edges of a grove @xmath92 with those of another grove on a different set of initial conditions ( allowing for some translation ) , we obtain a multiset of edges ; this multiset should roughly decompose again as the union of the edge sets of two groves on some other sets of initial conditions , plus some extra edges .",
    "indeed , because _ every _ @xmath1 counts groves on the initial conditions induced by a translation of @xmath358 , the cube recurrence ( [ recur ] ) implies that the grove - condensation statement must be true .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ kuogrov ] , here for the initial conditions given by @xmath359 . for visual simplicity",
    ", the short edges are omitted ; the figure shows a multiset of long edges , together with two decompositions into groves on one pair of sets of initial conditions ( left ) and two decompositions into groves on another pair ( right ) .",
    "notice that the decompositions on the right side of the figure lack the upper - right edge and the bottom edge ; these are the fixed extra edges for this pair of initials .",
    "however , we have not found a proof of theorem [ mainthm ] along these lines .",
    "the difficulty seems to lie in characterizing the objects obtained by combining two groves on different initial conditions .",
    "a union of matchings of a graph and a subgraph is a relatively nice object  it is a multiset of edges such that certain vertices each belong to exactly two edges and all other vertices belong to exactly one ; consequently , it can be characterized as a vertex - disjoint union of cycles , doubled edges , paths , and isolated edges .",
    "in contrast , no simple description of the objects obtained by combining two groves seems readily available , nor is it apparent what the procedure should be for decomposing these superimpositions back into groves . it would be interesting to have an understanding of these gadgets , so that theorem [ mainthm ] could be proven by condensation .",
    "it appears , however , that the machinery of kuo condensation for groves would have to be substantially different from that known for matchings of graphs . in the usual form of kuo condensation",
    ", each multiset of edges can be decomposed into matchings of only one pair of subgraphs ( aside from the pair @xmath360 itself ) .",
    "we originally conjectured , by analogy , that each superimposition of two groves can only be decomposed back onto one of the three relevant other pairs of initial conditions .",
    "preliminary investigations have found this conjecture to be false .",
    "this makes the prospect of kuo condensation for groves all the more interesting , but deeper explorations of the topic are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "another open area of research concerning groves relates to the connection between the cube and octahedron recurrences discussed above .",
    "does the correspondence between perfect matchings and groves tell us anything about matchings  or about groves ?",
    "in particular , the known kuo condensation algorithm for matchings may shed light on the analogue for groves .",
    "one more interesting question relates to the form of the cube recurrence originally proposed by propp .",
    "the polynomials generated by the octahedron recurrence , with standard initial conditions @xmath361 , can be seen not only as enumerating matchings of graphs but also as enumerating compatible pairs of alternating - sign matrices : in each monomial , the exponents with which the variables @xmath7 appear correspond to the entries of the matrices .",
    "( see @xcite for details . ) in particular , if we set @xmath362 whenever @xmath363 , then the terms of the resulting polynomial ( in the variables @xmath364 ) correspond precisely to single alternating - sign matrices .",
    "as propp observed in @xcite , something analogous seems to be taking place with the cube recurrence for initial conditions @xmath182 . specifically , fix @xmath362 for @xmath365 , and also set each edge variable equal to @xmath12 .",

    "the exponents of these @xmath183 , which must be @xmath367 , or @xmath12 ( this is easy to check , since , after translation and intersection , each such point only belongs to three rhombi ) , form a sort of `` alternating - sign triangle . ''",
    "an example is shown in figure [ astri ] : at left is the grove for a particular monomial ; at right is the alternating - sign triangle for the same monomial , formed by the exponents of the @xmath183 corresponding to the circled vertices .     and",
    "the corresponding alternating - sign triangle , width=576 ]    the question therefore arises as to whether there exists some nice description for the set of alternating - sign triangles of a given size , analogous to that for alternating - sign matrices .",
    "the prospect of developing a theory of alternating - sign triangles is a tantalizing one .",
    "the analogy with matchings of graphs thus provides a wellspring of inspiration for further questions about groves .",

    "<S> we construct a combinatorial model that is described by the cube recurrence , a nonlinear recurrence relation introduced by propp , which generates families of laurent polynomials indexed by points in @xmath0 . in the process </S>",
    "<S> , we prove several conjectures of propp and of fomin and zelevinsky , and we obtain a combinatorial interpretation for the terms of gale - robinson sequences . we also indicate how the model might be used to obtain some interesting results about perfect matchings of certain bipartite planar graphs . </S>"
