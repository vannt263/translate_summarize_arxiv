    "the last decade has seen the first instances of statistical studies with quasars using purely photometric samples .",
    "examples of these include the measurement of the integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect @xcite and cosmic magnification bias @xcite , and studies of the clustering of quasars on large @xcite and small @xcite scales .",
    "the importance of photometrically classified quasar samples will only increase during the next decade as large new imaging surveys will uncover large samples of quasars at fainter magnitudes , with minimal spectroscopy for the faintest objects .",
    "while efficient photometric classification is one requirement to facilitate studies of quasars without extensive spectroscopy , it has also been crucial to develop accurate methods for quasar redshift estimation based on broadband photometry .",
    "techniques for photometric redshift estimation have long been successful for galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and became feasible for quasars with the advent of precise multi - filter photometry @xcite .",
    "closely related to the quasar photometric - redshift problem  traditionally seen as a _ regression _ problem  is the question as to how best to perform photometric _ classification _ of quasars .",
    "it has become clear that the best classifiers are probabilistic in nature in that they calculate probabilities for objects to be quasars based on accurately calibrated models for stellar and quasar photometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these probabilities are often calculated for quasars in certain broad redshift ranges , and they therefore also act as low - resolution photometric redshifts for the objects they classify as quasars . the object classification technique of @xcite uses bins of width @xmath1 and , thus , achieves classification with a finer photometric - redshift estimate . however , detailed photometric redshift estimates for photometrically classified quasars utilize heterogeneous techniques , such that the resulting redshift probability distributions are inconsistent with the broad probabilities used for the initial quasar classification . for instance , this is the case for the photometric quasar catalogs of @xcite . for these catalogs , a non - parametric kernel - density - estimation ( kde ) technique that ignores photometric uncertainties",
    "was used to classify quasars , while a parametric model that convolves the quasar color locus with the photometric uncertainties  a single gaussian distribution in bins of redshift @xmath2was applied to estimate redshift @xcite .    for many purposes",
    ", one would like to target quasars in arbitrary redshift ranges that differ from those predetermined and imposed by a broad classification method .",
    "for example , the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( _ boss _ ; @xcite ) of _ the sloan digital sky survey iii _ ( _ sdss - iii _ ) aims to measure the baryon acoustic feature in the ly@xmath3 forest of medium - redshift ( @xmath4 ) quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spectral range accessible to the _ boss _  spectrographs is @xmath5   ( barkhouser et al . , 2011 , in preparation ) , thus _ boss _  can only study the ly@xmath3 forest as traced by redshift @xmath6 quasars .",
    "therefore , _ boss",
    "_  requires quasars to be targeted based on their probability to be at redshift @xmath7 , and the _ boss _  quasar classifiers were trained with this constraint ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , other ground - based instruments can observe at shorter wavelengths , e.g. , the multi - object double spectrograph for the large binocular telescope , which can observe the spectral range @xmath8   @xcite .",
    "this instrument could study the ly@xmath3 forest starting at redshift @xmath9 .",
    "an ly@xmath3 forest experiment designed for the large binocular telescope might therefore target quasars in the redshift range @xmath10 in addition to those at higher redshift .",
    "another example of a project that requires accurate photometric characterization of quasars is the search for binary quasars @xcite , where the key metric is the probability that two objects are both quasars _ and _ proximate in redshift , i.e. , the joint ( or `` overlapping '' ) probability that both components of a pair of objects are quasars of a particular redshift .",
    "similarly , the search for projected quasar pairs for absorption line studies @xcite requires the joint probability that both objects in a projected pair are quasars .",
    "such calculations require a full model of quasar probabilities and redshifts .",
    "ideally , therefore , photometric redshift estimation and quasar classification ought to be performed together .    in the specific case of objects observed using the @xmath0  filter system @xcite , quasar photometric redshifts are plagued by a host of degeneracies at redshifts where various quasar emission lines are mistaken for the ly@xmath3 line @xcite",
    "; this results in `` catastrophic '' redshift failures , although consideration of the full redshift posterior distribution function ( pdf ) shows that most of these failures have a significant integrated probability around the correct redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ; see below ) .",
    "the addition of non-@xmath0  data , e.g. , ultraviolet ( uv ) and near - infrared ( nir ) measurements , can both alleviate these redshift degeneracies _ and _ improve quasar  star separation .",
    "quasar classification and characterization in the infrared has been considered for simulated objects and for quasar samples with a range of depths and areas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the technique we introduce in this article , which we denote _ xdqsoz _ , is the first that deals with the simultaneous classification of quasars and assignation of quasar redshifts .",
    "this technique extends the _ xdqso _  quasar classification technique of @xcite to model the density of quasars in color  redshift space with a flexible semi - parametric model consisting of a large set of gaussian component distributions .",
    "this model can be integrated analytically over any redshift range to calculate probabilities from flux measurements for individual objects .",
    "this , in turn , allows quasar probabilities to be calculated over any redshift range .",
    "thus , a probability distribution in redshift space ( a `` pdf '' ) is a natural component of the model . because we use the _ extreme deconvolution _ ( xd )",
    "technique @xcite as our density estimation tool , the method can be trained on and applied to low signal - to - noise ratio data , even with missing values , e.g. , to objects missing measurements in any arbitrary collection of filters .",
    "this feature allows us to naturally include uv  and nir  broadband fluxes , where sky coverages differ , as part of our model space and to distinguish sources that are missing data in a particular band from objects that are dropping out of that band .",
    "we show that the addition of uv  and nir  broadband fluxes improves quasar  star separation significantly and that it essentially breaks all of the redshift degeneracies inherent to the @xmath0  filter set .",

    "a technique for photometric redshift estimation of quasars should have the following properties .",
    "* it should provide full probability distributions for the redshift of the quasar based on its observed photometry , because this information has particular utility for quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) as near - degeneracies in redshift estimation from broadband photometry are ubiquitous for quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the photometric uncertainties should be treated properly to allow photometric redshift estimation for faint objects . *",
    "if based on an empirical training set , the technique should be able to be trained on low signal - to - noise ratio data with potentially missing data .",
    "the training set and the evaluation set should also be allowed to have different noise properties , e.g. , different distributions of signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "for example , while the optical fluxes are mostly well measured for a spectroscopic training sample , the addition of uv  and nir  data can help break redshift degeneracies ( see below ) , but these measurements often have low signal - to - noise ratio , even for the training set .",
    "* the technique should allow an explicit redshift prior to be specified .",
    "the key to photometric classification and redshift estimation for quasars based on broadband fluxes is the joint probability of an object s fluxes , its redshift , and the proposition that it is a quasar @xmath12",
    ". this joint probability can be re - written in several ways that correspond to different ways of approaching the problem @xmath13 photometric redshift estimation corresponds to the probability of an object s redshift conditioned on its fluxes and assuming that it is a quasar : @xmath14 quasar classification is the probability that an object is a quasar based on its fluxes . to classify quasars in a certain redshift range @xmath15",

    "the discussion above suggests that a unified approach to classification and photometric redshift estimation is possible . because the method described in this article  is the first technique in this class , we briefly discuss previous attempts at photometric redshift estimation and how they fit in the framework outlined in this section .",
    "the @xmath21-nearest neighbors approach of @xcite is an instance - based machine - learning technique that compares the colors of test objects to the @xmath21 nearest objects in color - space in a training set , and assigns a weighted combination of the redshifts of those nearest neighbors to the test object .",
    "its generalization to take observational flux - uncertainties into account involves perturbing both the test and the training data within their gaussian noise ellipsoids @xcite . in its noiseless implementation",
    "the method does not return a full probability distribution for the redshift . when taking the photometric uncertainties into account the technique essentially returns samples from @xmath22 as in equation  ( [ eq : jointprob3 ] ) , which can be binned to obtain the full posterior distribution function .",
    "while the photometric uncertainties of the test objects are handled correctly , the approach for dealing with the uncertainties of the training data effectively convolves with the uncertainties twice , as it adds scatter to the training data that are already scattered from the intrinsic distribution due to photometric noise .",
    "because the technique directly uses the training set , it also implicitly applies a redshift prior that approaches the _ observed _ redshift distribution .",
    "this choice of prior does not reflect the _ intrinsic _ redshift distribution , as the _ observed _ distribution is shaped by various selection effects @xcite .    the approach taken by @xcite consists of fitting the relative - flux  redshift distribution and its scatter to produce the likelihood of the quasar redshift as in equation  ( [ eq : jointprob1 ] ) .",
    "this fit is conducted without taking the flux uncertainties into account , but upon evaluation of test objects the flux uncertainties are fully handled .",
    "closest to the approach taken in this article  is the technique of @xcite .",
    "the distribution of colors in a set of narrow bins in redshift is fit as a single multi - variate gaussian distribution .",
    "this approach is similar to quasar classification approaches where the color or relative - flux distributions of quasars are fit in much broader redshift ranges using more general density models ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite do not use the photometric uncertainties of the data they use for training .",
    "but , as in @xcite , photometric uncertainties for test objects are fully taken into account .    all of the techniques described above could be extended to allow quasar classification by specifying the necessary factors of @xmath23 or @xmath24 in equations  ( [ eq : jointprob1])([eq : jointprob3 ] ) .",
    "the latter could be taken from a quasar classification scheme such as nbc - kde @xcite or _ xdqso _",
    "@xcite , although care should be taken that the classification method uses the same redshift prior as the photometric redshift technique for consistency .",

    "we have previously discussed other photometric redshift estimation techniques for quasars in section  [ sec : general ] . comparing  [ fig : zspeczphotdr7qso ] to similar diagrams in @xcite we see , at least qualitatively , that the _ xdqsoz _  technique performs similarly when applied to the @xmath0  fluxes of bright , high signal - to - noise ratio objects .",
    "we did not expect to perform better as the near - degeneracies in the @xmath0  color  redshift plane are real and the quasar locus is broad .",
    "the advantage of the _ xdqsoz _  technique over these other techniques is that it can be applied to faint objects and that it can incorporate uv  and nir  observations , even at low signal - to - noise ratio , to improve photometric redshift estimation and quasar classification .",
    "no other method exists to calculate photometric quasar probabilities over arbitrary redshift ranges . by comparing with state - of - the - art photometric quasar classification using kernel - density estimation or gaussian mixture density deconvolution @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the photometric quasar probabilities obtained by integrating the photometric redshift pdf over redshift are as good as those trained on the redshift range in question .",
    "two additional sources of information relevant to photometric quasar classification and redshift estimation stand out as the next steps toward a full quasar model , although neither of these is currently available over the large areas of the sky surveyed by projects such as the _ sdss _ : photometric variability and differential - chromatic - refraction - induced astrometric offsets for quasars . of these",
    ", photometric variability is the easiest to include in the quasar classification technique discussed here , as we can ignore the redshift information contained in the variability , because this information seems to be limited @xcite . as such , a photometric variability likelihood for quasars and stars",
    "could be multiplied with the flux ",
    "redshift likelihood employed and modeled here to perform simultaneous color and variability selection .",
    "the combination of photometric variability and color information will lead to accurate photometric quasar classification and redshift estimation in the _ lsst _  era .",
    "the strong spectral features of quasars induce positional offsets to standard differential - chromatic - refraction corrections @xcite .",
    "these positional offsets are redshift dependent much as quasar colors are redshift dependent because of spectral features moving through individual filters ( see , e.g. ,  [ fig : allzexfit ] ) .",
    "thus , these offsets could be used to break redshift degeneracies . accomplishing this in the _ xdqsoz _  flux ",
    "redshift density context necessitates adding the astrometric offsets into the density model . because the astrometric offsets are zenith angle dependent",
    ", these models would have to be constructed for a range of airmasses , or airmass could be added as an additional dimension .",
    "as astrometric redshifts are a subtle and difficult - to - measure effect , the deconvolution aspect of the xd  density - estimation technique could be useful .",
    "the technique described in this article  is a step toward a generalized method for object classification and characterization from broadband photometric data , which will become increasingly relevant in this era of major wide - field imaging surveys .",
    "while our quasar model includes redshift in addition to the broadband fluxes of an object , our star model does not because stars do not possess a cosmological redshift .",
    "stars are characterized by other properties  e.g . ,",
    "distance and metallicity  that are often estimated photometrically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we are interested here in quasar classification and characterization , our model implicitly marginalized over stellar properties .",
    "however , as part of a general object classification pipeline , these properties should be included  and the technique developed in this paper could be applied .",
    "more importantly , the general framework outlined in section  [ sec : general ] and the specific implementation in sections  [ sec : xdqsoz ] and [ sec : targeting ] show that we can perform classification when different models are characterized by different parameters  even different _ numbers _ of parameters .",
    "this aspect is especially relevant in the context of quasar selection based on variability .",
    "quasar variability is commonly modeled as a stochastic gaussian process @xcite characterized by a small number of parameters .",
    "recently it has been shown that this framework allows for a clean selection of quasars because most stars  the main contaminants for",
    "quasar targeting currently  in general do not vary over long time baselines . in this type of selection , however , quasars and stars are often modeled ( or fit ) using the same stochastic model , which is inappropriate for the stars ( @xcite ; however , see @xcite ) .",
    "the use of a stochastic model for variability - based star ",
    "quasar separation is particularly problematic for rr lyrae stars  a common contaminant in color - based classification of quasars in some redshift ranges .",
    "rr lyraes are known to vary periodically rather than stochastically . in the framework we use in this article  all classes of objects",
    "can be described using models appropriate for the class  e.g .",
    ", stochastically varying objects with a cosmological redshift for the quasars and non - variable sources for most stars ",
    "because object classification only uses _ marginalized _ probabilities , that is , probabilities marginalized over the internal properties of each class ( cf .  equation  [ [ eq : quasardeltazprob ] ] ) . describing each class with a model appropriate for",
    "that class should lead to better classification and simultaneous object classification of sources into _ all _ classes .",
    "as photometric quasar classification moves to ever fainter flux levels , contamination from point - like galaxies becomes increasingly important . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "unresolved galaxies are implicitly taken into account in our model because our training set of `` stars '' is actually a set of non - variable point - like objects that therefore includes faint galaxies .",
    "this model of galaxies again implicitly marginalizes over galaxy properties , most notably the redshift of the galaxy .",
    "photometric redshift estimation for galaxies is closely related to obtaining photometric redshifts for quasars , but the galaxy photometric redshift techniques tend to rely more on templates in their model building , while quasars are modeled in a more empirical manner ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . however , this distinction is not fundamental and the general framework discussed here still applies .",
    "template - based models are just another way of obtaining the probability @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "the _ xdqsoz _  model of section  [ sec : xdqsoz ] also contains the distribution of broadband fluxes as a function of redshift @xmath122 such as is used to compute mean quasar color tracks .",
    "this probability density is obtained from the full _ xdqsoz _  model flux ",
    "redshift density by conditioning on redshift . for the relative flux",
    "this leads to a mixture of gaussians with means , variances , and amplitudes given by expressions similar to those in equations  ( [ eq : means ] ) and ( [ eq : alphazk])essentially , relative flux and redshift need to be interchanged in those equations",
    ". properties of this distribution can be calculated from the mixture of gaussians .",
    "for example , the mean quasar relative flux ( or color ) as a function of redshift is obtained by weighting the means of the gaussian components using the redshift - dependent amplitudes .",
    "code to calculate the mean quasar color track is included in the package described in the .",
    "in this article  we have introduced a new approach to photometric quasar classification that can simultaneously classify quasars and characterize their redshifts based on broadband photometry .",
    "this technique , _ xdqsoz _ , is an extension of the _ xdqso _  technique of @xcite that adds the unknown redshift as an extra parameter to the quasar model to obtain the likelihood @xmath123 that is central to both quasar classification and photometric redshift estimation .",
    "we have shown that this combined approach is both the best current quasar classification technique ",
    "it has similar performance as the _ xdqso _  method  and a competitive photometric redshift method .",
    "compared to other approaches to photometric redshift estimation for quasars it has the advantage that it can incorporate additional uv  and nir  data , even at low signal - to - noise ratio , and can be extended to fainter flux levels where photometric uncertainties are significant . using samples of quasars drawn from the _ sdss",
    "_ , _ 2slaq _ , and _ boss _  spectroscopic catalogs we have demonstrated this increased performance down to @xmath124 mag .",
    "the addition of uv  and nir  data to the photometric redshift estimation problem essentially breaks all of the redshift degeneracies inherent to the @xmath0  filter set .",
