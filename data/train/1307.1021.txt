    "models of spontaneous wave function collapse  @xcite explicitly modify the schrdinger equation . new terms are added to the usual quantum hamiltonian which describe the nonlinear interaction between any system and a classical noise field .",
    "the effect of the new terms is to collapse the wave function in space .",
    "they are engineered in such way to give only small deviations from the schrdinger dynamics for microscopic systems",
    ". however , their effect grows with the size of the system such that for macroscopic objects the collapse of the wave function is dominant . in this way",
    "the possibility of having superpositions of different macroscopic states , like those described in the schrdinger s cat gedanken experiment , is avoided , and the quantum measurement problem vanishes .",
    "the deviation from the standard schrdinger dynamics implies that collapse models make predictions which differ from quantum mechanical ones .",
    "therefore , they can be tested experimentally  @xcite .",
    "so far the process of spontaneous emission of electromagnetic radiation from charged particles sets the strongest upper bound on the collapse parameters  @xcite among all possible tests .",
    "the idea is very simple .",
    "charged particles are always subject to a random motion due to the interaction with the noise causing the collapse .",
    "therefore they emit radiation even when according to standard quantum mechanics there should not be any .",
    "this problem has been considered several times in the literature  @xcite because of a discrepancy in the theoretical formulas , which have been derived using different techniques which are summarized in the introductory section of  @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "the situation is the following . when the emission rate is computed by using standard perturbation theory , two terms are present at the first perturbative order : the first one , as expected , is proportional to the fourier component of the correlation function of the noise field computed at the same frequency as that of the emitted photon .",
    "the second term is instead proportional to the zero fourier component of the noise field s correlation .",
    "this latter term is unexpected and seems unphysical .",
    "the analysis carried out in  @xcite shows that a way to avoid such an unphysical term is to use wave packets instead of plane waves and to confine the noise field to a bounded region .",
    "this means that standard perturbation theory can not be naively applied to collapse models but leaves open the question of the precise ( mathematical ) origin of the unphysical term .    in",
    "@xcite the same problem was considered within the mathematically simpler qmupl ( quantum mechanics with universal position localizations ) model  @xcite , which allows for an analytical treatment of the radiation process .",
    "it was shown that the undesired term is associated to an exponentially vanishing function of time . at first perturbative order",
    "it survives simply because the exponential is approximated by 1 .",
    "this result is true if the particle is bounded  no matter how weakly . in this paper",
    "we apply the same methodology used for the qmupl model to the structurally different csl model .",
    "we consider the csl model of a charged particle bounded by a harmonic potential .",
    "apart from the dipole approximation , we solve the equation of motion for the particle s electrodynamic part of the hamiltonian _ exactly _ while we treat the interaction with the noise field perturbatively .",
    "we show that the unphysical term does not appear  even when considering plane waves and without bounding the noise to a finite region .",
    "our analysis implies that the unphysical term , which is present in the standard first perturbative order , is canceled when higher order terms are included in the perturbative series .",
    "it appears fictitiously in the first perturbative analysis .",
    "we will comment on the picture which emerges from this analysis and on the relation between with the result of  @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the csl model , introduce the problem of radiation emission and summarize the results discussed in the literature .      for a given hamiltonian @xmath0",
    "the csl modified schrdinger equation  @xcite reads : @xmath1dw_{t}(\\mathbf{x})-\\frac{\\gamma}{2m_{0}^{2}}\\int d\\mathbf{x}\\,[m(\\mathbf{x})-\\langle m(\\mathbf{x})\\rangle_{t}]^{2}dt\\right]|\\psi_{t}\\rangle.\\label{eq : csl - massa}\\ ] ] matter is treated non - relativistically , which for our analysis is completely justified . the second and third term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "induce the collapse of the wave function in the position basis .",
    "they contain the parameter @xmath2 , a positive coupling constant which sets the strength of the collapse , and the reference mass @xmath3 , which is taken to be equal to that of a nucleon .",
    "the operator @xmath4 is given by the mass density of the second quantized matter field . in this article",
    "we however focus on the behavior of a single non - relativistic particle only , and hence , limit our analysis to the one - particle sector of the fock space of the matter field . in consequence ,",
    "the operator @xmath4 takes the form : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 denotes the mass of the particle , @xmath7 the position operator , and @xmath8 the second new phenomenological constant of the model does not contain photon operators since we are assuming that the spontaneous collapse process occurs only for massive particles .",
    "this is the standard choice for the csl model . ] .",
    "@xmath9 is an ensemble of independent wiener processes , one for each point in space , which are responsible for the random character of the evolution ; the quantum average @xmath10 is responsible for its nonlinear character .    the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "describes the unitary part of the evolution which is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "as anticipated , we study a system of a single non - relativistic charge coupled to a harmonic potential and a second - quantized electrodynamic field so that @xmath11.\\label{eq : h}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "the first term represents the dispersion relation of the particle minimally - coupled to the electromagnetic field , where @xmath12 denotes the electromagnetic vector potential .",
    "the second term models an external harmonic potential with angular frequency @xmath13 .",
    "this potential can later be removed by @xmath14 . finally , the last term is the dispersion relation of the electromagnetic field ( in coulomb gauge ) , where @xmath15 denotes the transverse part of the electric component and @xmath16 the magnetic one .",
    "the details of how to compute the photon emission rate to first perturbative order with the csl model can be found in  @xcite .",
    "here we however wish to recapitulate some important steps . in order to simplify the whole computation ,",
    "the starting point is to note that the master equation associated to eq .",
    "can also be derived from a standard schrdinger equation with a random hamiltonian : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a white noise field with correlation @xmath19=\\delta(t - s)\\delta({\\bf x - y})$ ] .",
    "the evolution is hence linear , thought stochastic . in consequence",
    ", it does not lead to state vector reduction .",
    "nevertheless , since it reproduces the same master equation as that associated to eq .  , and since any physical quantity that can be computed via the density matrix , it makes no practical difference whether to use eq .   or the standard schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath20 in order to computed the average value of observables .",
    "the second possibility however allows for the use of the tools of standard perturbation theory .",
    "one then identifies the unperturbed hamiltonian as that of the particle ( interaction with the noise field excluded ) plus the kinetic term of the electromagnetic field : @xmath21,\\ ] ] whose eigenstates and eigenvalues are known .",
    "the perturbed part of the hamiltonian contains both the matter - radiation interaction and the noise interaction : @xmath22 the feynman rules for this dynamics are reported in  @xcite . since one carries out the computation to the lowest order for both interactions one can neglect the second term in eq .  .",
    "to this perturbative order , the six feynman diagrams shown in fig",
    ". 1 have to be considered .     while each noise vertex gives a factor proportional to @xmath23.,title=\"fig:\",width=623 ]    when computing the square modulus of the transition amplitude the lowest order contributions are those proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "these are obtained by taking the square modulus of the sum of the contributions due to the first two diagrams 1a and 1b , plus the product between the complex conjugate of the contribution due to the single - vertex diagram 2 with each one of the contributions corresponding to the three - vertex diagrams 3a , 3b , 3c plus the complex conjugate of this last contribution .",
    "the first two diagrams are expected from a naive application of the feynman rules .",
    "they are the only ones which have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that , for a free particle ( @xmath25 ) , one can always choose an initial state of zero momentum . in this case ,",
    "diagram 2 vanishes .",
    "moreover , in such a situation also diagram 1b vanishes .",
    "this implies that the only non - zero contribution comes from diagram 1a , as computed in  @xcite .    in order to determine the probability for the particle to emit one photon with wave vector @xmath26 and polarization @xmath27 ,",
    "one has to take the square modulus of the transition amplitude @xmath28 , average over the noise , and , since one is not interested in the final state of the particle , sum over all its possible final states @xmath29 .",
    "since one is also not interested in the direction and the polarization of the emitted photon , also a sum over these degrees of freedom has to be taken . this second sum contributes with a factor equal to @xmath30 .",
    "finally , in order to infer the emission rate one has to take the time derivative . putting all pieces together",
    ", one has : @xmath31    it is now instructive to consider the more general case of non - white noises , since it helps in clarifying the issue at stake .",
    "for this one encodes the noise field time correlation by a generic function @xmath32 instead of a dirac delta function .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that , as far as one keeps the computation at the lowest order in @xmath2 , there are no problems involved in naively extending collapse models to non - white noises simply by generalizing the correlation function of the noise",
    ".    as it was shown in detail in  @xcite and the final result for the emission rate is given by : @xmath33 , \\label{eq : rate non white}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 equal to the collapse rate first introduced in the grw model  @xcite , and : @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the noise field time correlation .",
    "in the white noise case @xmath37 , which implies @xmath38 .    the second term of eq .   is the expected one : the probability of emitting a photon with momentum @xmath39 is proportional to the weight of the fourier component of the noise correlation corresponding to the frequency @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "the first term is independent of the photon s momentum .",
    "it is related to the zero energy component of the field only .",
    "this is unexpected as the typical picture is that the noise gives energy to the particle , and such energy is converted into that of the emitted photon .",
    "therefore , it should not be the case that the zero energy component of the field allows to emit a photon with an arbitrarily high energy .",
    "one can object that this is a peculiar feature of the csl model which differs from the standard quantum picture .",
    "this criticism can be easily rejected by remembering that , in order to perform the computation in an easier way , one has effectively considered a standard quantum hamiltonian with a random term .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , in  @xcite a first way out to the problem was found . by repeating the calculation with using a wave packet to represent the final state of the particle and with the noise being confined to a bounded region",
    ", the undesired term disappears .",
    "this means that this term comes from a naive use of perturbation theory .",
    "the origin of the unphysical term was investigated in  @xcite for the simple qmupl model , showing that it arises when higher order terms in the electromagnetic interaction are neglected . here",
    "we prove this result for the csl model , which is structurally different from the qmupl model .",
    "technical details are reproduced in the next section . in this section",
    "we discuss the main result and conclusions .",
    "we define the unperturbed and perturbed hamiltonian as follows : @xmath41 -\\frac{e}{m}\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}+\\frac{e^{2}}{2m}\\mathbf{a}^{2 }   \\label{eq : one } \\\\",

    "\\label{eq : two}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means that , differently from  @xcite , we will solve the heisenberg equations of motion exactly ( except for the dipole approximation ) for the free kinetic term of the particle and the _ full _ electromagnetic term . in this way",
    "we automatically include higher order terms in the electromagnetic field in our analysis , which will prove to be crucial .",
    "the noise terms will be analyzed only to first perturbative order .",
    "differently from  @xcite , we will not confine the noise to a bounded region , and our result will be independent of the initial and final state of the particle .",
    "most integrals can be solved exactly .",
    "we identify those terms , which at lowest order in @xmath42 give a finite contribution to the asymptotic emission rate , while they decay exponentially in time when higher order corrections are included , as in our case .",
    "such terms are precisely those responsible for the appearance of the term @xmath43 in eq .  .",
    "when such terms are appropriately taken into account the formula for the emission rate becomes : @xmath44 where only terms proportional to @xmath45 survive .",
    "this formula , in the free particle limit @xmath46 , reduces to : @xmath47 which is the expected result .",
    "this result shows that , as anticipated in the work of  @xcite with the qmupl model , the suspicious term in eq .   arises because calculations were limited to the lowest perturbative order .",
    "the picture which emerges is the following .",
    "the noise acts always in time , not just for a short period as in standard two body interactions .",
    "therefore , even if it is weak its effect builds up constantly , and in the large time limit ( the one always considered in the literature ) it makes the perturbative analysis untenable .",
    "the analysis of  @xcite proved that by taking final wave packets in place of plane waves , and by confining the noise to a bounded region , is a way to constraint the effect of the noise  so to say , to make it formally equivalent to a standard scattering process  so that perturbative techniques can be safely applied .",
    "our analysis shows clearly that the true behavior can be understood only by taking higher order terms into account .",
    "these terms are dominant in the large time limit and force all undesired terms to vanish exponentially .",
    "we point out that , in order to derive the correct result , it is necessary to bound the particle with a ( harmonic ) potential , no matter how weakly . only at the end of all calculations",
    ", the free particle limit can be taken .",
    "this procedure is perfectly consistent with physical reality , where free particles which are perfectly free forever do not exist . on the mathematical level",
    "however it shows that for a perfectly free particle , even when higher order terms are included in the perturbative analysis , the undesired term remains .",
    "hence , in the large time limit , the zero component of the noise has all the time to induce photon emission at any frequency .",
    "this result is consistent with the analysis of  @xcite for the qmupl model .",
    "but again this is only a mathematical truth , which does not apply to the physical world .",
    "this section is mainly technical .",
    "we show how to derive the emission rate formula given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalharmonic ] ) .",
    "the relevant steps are the following .    * in subsection iv.a we consider the master equation for the density matrix @xmath48 , and we use it to compute the expectation value of a generic observable , to first perturbative order in @xmath2 , while the electromagnetic term is treated exactly ( modulo the dipole approximation ) .",
