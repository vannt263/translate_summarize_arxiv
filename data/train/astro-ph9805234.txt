    "vega ( @xmath1 lyr = hd 172167 = hr 7001 ) is a population i star of spectral type a0 v , with a projected rotational velocity @xmath2 km@xmath3s@xmath4 .",
    "it has been extensively studied both for its role of primary spectrophotometric standard in the visual and in the uv , respectively , and for its role of comparison star in abundance studies of a - type stars .",
    "vega has a distinctly non  solar composition . since baschek & slettebak ( 1988 ) drew attention to the similarity between the abundance pattern of @xmath0 boo stars and that of vega , there has been a long debate whether vega should be listed among the chemically peculiar stars of @xmath0",
    "boo type .",
    "moreover , baschek & slettebak suggested that the @xmath0 boo stars may be regarded as _ rotating vegas _ , or conversely vega may be regarded as a _ mild non  rotating @xmath0 boo star_.",
    "high dispersion spectrum ( 4 @xmath3mm@xmath4 ) of vega was obtained with the coud spectrograph of the ondejov observatory 2m telescope on 19 august 1992 .",

    "the abundances of individual elements are derived by the curve - of - growth method . altogether , 245 lines of 16 elements have been identified and their equivalent widths were measured .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of the abundance analysis are given in table 1 along with the results of a previous study by adelman & gulliver ( 1990 ) .",
    "for reference we also give the solar composition from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "abundances are expressed as @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0 boo stars are a class of metal - poor population i a - type stars . since the prototype was recognized by w.w .",

    "the most detailed abundance study of @xmath0 boo stars was performed by strenburg ( 1993 ) who analyzed 13 stars . the abundance pattern known from previous studies",
    "was confirmed : ( i ) the light elements ( c , n , o and s ) have a solar abundance , and ( ii ) the heavier elements ( mg , al , ca , fe , ... ) are underabundant by up to a factor of 100 .",
    "vega is not included in the recent ` consolidated catalogue of @xmath0 bootis stars ' by paunzen et al .",

    "however , its abundance pattern clearly resembles those of @xmath0 boo stars as inferred from comparison with strenburg s results for his sample of @xmath0 boo stars ( fig .",

    "holweger & rentsch  holm ( 1995 ) have found that if vega was observed at a more typical inclination , it would follow the correlation between ca deficiency and rotation shown by other stars of the @xmath0 boo class . in that sense",

    "evidence for rapid rotation of vega came from luminosity excess ( gray 1988 ) and detailed line profile calculations ( gulliver et al .",
