    "the study of an elastic rods @xcite is a subject to increased interest @xcite especially in connection with the biomathematical models of proteins and of dna @xcite .",
    "the main feature of a thin rod is a space curve ( rod s axis ) and the corresponding orthonormal frame with a tangent vector @xmath0 to the axial curve .",
    "the static energy of the elastic rod is related to the bending and twisting energies .",
    "it is tempting to map the elastic rod problem to a classical spin chain @xcite ( in the continuum limit , where the normalized spin @xmath1 is mapped onto the tangent vector @xmath2 ) .",
    "we will show however that the full mapping of the elastic rod onto a spin - chain model requires a system of two orthogonal spins .",
    "the spin hamiltonian for a heisenberg spin chain is given by the following expression : @xmath3 in the continuum limit this hamiltonian goes over to @xmath4 in the case of xy spin chain the spin is given by the rotation angle @xmath5 : @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian now reads @xmath7    this letter is organized as follows : in section 2 are discussed the static properties of the kirchhof equations for a thin elastic rod .",
    "it is shown that if a curvature is present the twist angle satisfies the static sine - gordon equation .",
    "the mapping of the kirchhoff model onto a xy spin chain is done in section 3 . in section 4 the soliton - like solutions for the static sine - gordon equations",
    "are briefly discussed .",
    "the model introduced by kirchhoff ( 1859 ) describes the shape and the dynamics of a thin elastic rod in equilibrium and is based on the analogy with the dynamics of a heavy spinning top ( the lagrange case ) .",
    "the shape is described by the _",
    "static kirchhoff model _ while the time evolution  by the _ dynamical kirchhoff model_. here we will concentrate on the statics of thin elastic rods ( here and below we shall call them kirchhoff rods ) .",
    "we consider a static space curve @xmath8 as a smooth function mapping the arc - length interval @xmath9 into the physical space @xmath10 .",
    "for every @xmath11 we define the frenet basis @xmath12 to be the normal , binormal and the tangent vectors to the curve(s ) .",
    "the tangent vector is a unit vector given by @xmath13 and the curvature @xmath14 of the curve at the point @xmath11 is then given by : @xmath15 the triad @xmath12 evolves along @xmath11 according to the frenet ",
    "serret equations : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the torsion of the curve @xmath18 .",
    "if the curvature @xmath19 and the torsion @xmath17 are known for all @xmath11 then the frenet ",
    "serret triad can be obtained as unique solution of ( [ eq : fren - ser ] ) .",
    "next the space curve @xmath18 can be reconstructed by integrating the tangent vector @xmath20 .",
    "a thin rod can be modelled by a space curve @xmath18 joining the loci of the centroids of the cross sections together with the local basis @xmath21 attached to the rod material .",
    "this local basis can be expressed through the frenet ",
    "seret triad as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the twist angle of the rod .",
    "the components of the derivatives of the local basis @xmath24 with respect to @xmath11 can be expressed by using the twist vector @xmath25 as follows : @xmath26 the static kirchhoff equations describe the shape of the rod under the effects of internal elastic stresses and boundary constraints , in the absence of external force fields .",
    "let @xmath27 is the tension and @xmath28 is the torque of the rod .",
    "in the approximation of a linear theory ( the hook s law applies ) the torque @xmath29 is related to the twist vector @xmath30 by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "the constant @xmath33 measures the asymmetry of the cross section and @xmath34 is the scaled torsional stiffness . in particular for symmetric ( @xmath35 ) hyperelastic ( @xmath36 ) rods we have @xmath37 . in the generic case",
    "the torque is @xmath38 and the elastic energy of the kirchhoff rod is given by : @xmath39 the conservation of the linear and angular momenta is provided by the static kirchhoff equations : @xmath40 here @xmath27 is the tension of the rod and the torque @xmath41 is given by ( [ eq : torque ] ) and the twist vector reads @xmath42 where the twist angle @xmath23 is a function of the arc length parameter @xmath11 : @xmath43 . the expression for the tension @xmath44 in the local basis @xmath45 : @xmath46 reduces the kirchhoff equations ( [ eq : kirchhoff - f ] ) and ( [ eq : kirchhoff - m ] ) to the following system of ode s : @xmath47 using the parameterization of the twist vector ( [ eq : kappa_0 ] ) from ( [ eq : krichhoff - helix - f3 ] ) for the case of constant curvature @xmath48 we get the famous static ( scalar ) sine  gordon equation : @xmath49 this second order differential equation is a completely integrable hamiltonian system and allows so - called `` soliton''-like solutions .",
    "it appears in a wide variety of physical problems for e.g. charge - density - wave materials , splay waves in membranes , magnetic flux in josephson lines , torsion coupled pendula , propagation of crystal dislocations , bloch wall motion in magnetic crystals , two - dimensional elementary particle models in the quantum field theory , etc .    for a symmetric rod ,",
    "i.e. @xmath35 the equation ( [ eq : krichhoff - helix - sg ] ) simplifies to @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "this is the usual case widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the cross - section of the symmetric rod ( @xmath35 ) has a continuous rotational symmetry around the central axis .",
    "therefore the elastic energy density @xmath52 does not depend on @xmath53 and from the variational principle it follows that @xmath52 could be only a function of the derivatives @xmath54 .",
    "therefore the only solution for a constant twist is @xmath51 .",
    "there have been even attempts to generalize this result to the asymmetric case ( @xmath55 ) @xcite , i.e. to show that @xmath51 holds true for any kirchhoff rod .",
    "the asymmetric case has been overlooked for a long time . for a constant curvature and torsion along the centre - line it represents another integrable case of the kirchhoff equations for a thin elastic rod .",
    "this opens new possibilities for a more adequate modelling of bio - polymers and gives the phenomenological bases for the widely used dna models .",
    "here there is no more continuous rotational symmetry of the cross - section around the centre axis and obviously @xmath52 depends on @xmath23 as well .",
    "so the constant twist is no more a solution .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : krichhoff - helix - sg ] ) is compatible with the full system of kirchhoff equations ( [ eq : krichhoff - helix - f1s])([eq : krichhoff - helix - f3 ] ) for constant curvature and torsion .",
    "let us consider the following spin chain model with two perpendicular spins per site : the spin vectors @xmath56 and @xmath57 have different lengths and are given by @xmath58 here also both spin vectors are orthogonal:@xmath59 for every @xmath11 .",
    "this is an integrable system with hamiltonian given by @xmath60 which in the continuum limit leads to : @xmath61   \\,ds= j_1\\int_{s_1}^{s_2}\\left ( b(\\tau + \\phi_s)^2 + \\kappa^2(a-1)\\sin ^2 \\phi\\right ) \\,ds , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the renormalized coupling constant , @xmath63 $ ] and the subscript @xmath11 means a derivative with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "this hamiltonian coincides with that one in ( [ eq : helast ] ) where @xmath64 has been replaced from ( [ eq : kappa_0 ] ) .",
    "thus the asymmetric kirchhoff rod is mapped onto a two - spin chain . if the curvature is constant @xmath65 , then the euler  lagrange equation gives the ( scalar ) static sine ",
    "gordon equation : @xmath66     that corresponds to the kirchhoff rod model.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    when @xmath67 the hamiltonian ( [ eq : helix - hamilt ] ) simplifies to @xmath68 , so the euler - lagrange equation leads to @xmath69 , or @xmath51 .",
    "note that the case @xmath35 corresponds to a symmetrical kirchhoff rod .",
    "such a rod - model is mapped onto a symmetrical spin chain system @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "note that the mapping of the kirchhoff symmetric rod needs a two - spin xy chain rather than a simple one - spin xy chain . from ( [ eq : helix - sg ] )",
    "one can easily get that @xmath72 which may be used for the calculation of the corresponding static energy .",
    "for the asymmetric thin elastic rod the model hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath73 here we shall discuss in brief the static soliton solutions of the model ( [ eq : helix - model - hamilt ] ) : the kink type solution of the static sine - gordon equation ( [ eq : krichhoff - helix - sg ] ) , ( [ eq : helix - sg ] ) is given by @xmath74 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the corresponding static energy is @xmath75 the periodic ( soliton lattice ) solution of ( [ eq : krichhoff - helix - sg ] ) , ( [ eq : helix - sg ] ) is @xmath76\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the periodicity @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the modulus of the jacobian elliptic function sn ( sine amplitude ) , and @xmath79 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . in the limit @xmath80",
    "we have @xmath81 and the half - period tends to infinity as well , so we recover the single kink soliton solution ( [ eq : kink ] ) .",
    "the corresponding static energy per soliton of the soliton lattice is given by : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the complete elliptic integral of second kind .",
    "in the single soliton limit ( @xmath80 ) the lattice energy per soliton ( [ eq : e - periodic ] ) reduces to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : energy - kink ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the single asymmetric elastic kirchhoff rod model can be mapped onto a 2-spin xy heisenberg chain and the spin vectors must have different lengths . in this case",
    "the euler - lagrange equation for the spin chain hamiltonian gives the static sine - gordon equation .",
    "for the case of symmetric rods ( @xmath35 ) both spins have the same length .",
    "the symmetric ( @xmath35 ) and the asymmetric ( @xmath55 ) kirchhoff rods have very different static properties . in general the family of thin elastic kirchhoff rods",
    "falls into two groups : i ) the group of symmetric rods ( @xmath35 ) . here",
    "the twist is constant along the rod and if the torsion is constant as well , the kirchhoff equations are integrable and the curvature satisfies the non - linear schrdinger equation ; ii ) the group of asymmetric rods ( @xmath84 ) . here in general the twist and the curvature",
    "satisfy a coupled differential equations ( for a constant torsion ) . in the special case where the curvature is constant",
    "the system of kirchhoff equations is integrable again and the twist satisfies the sine - gordon equation .",
    "the dynamics of such models , which is of interest for realistic biopolymers , should be investigated . due to the galilean invariance of the sine - gordon equation ( [ eq : krichhoff - helix - sg ] ) a special class of dynamical travelling wave type solutions",
    "can be obtained from the static ones by galilean boost .",
    "the general assumption that all thin rods exhibit constant twist should now be restricted to the class of symmetric thin rods only and to all straight rods as well .",
    "the class of asymmetric thin rods does not belong to this category . here",
    "the twist is not constant and `` interacts '' with the curvature . in the case of constant curvature , the problem has exact solution . for non - constant curvature",
    "the case is more complex and should be of considerable interest e.g. for the problem of dna supercoiling @xcite .",
