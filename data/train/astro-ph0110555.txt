    "1986 , demers & irwin 1987 , buonanno et al . 1985 ,",
    "stetson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however they all suffered from some limitations .",
    "for instance @xcite cover a large area with deep photometry but they do nt have enough epochs to determine periods for their candidate variables .",
    "@xcite did have a lot of data but they covered a very small area ; they have light curves for only two variable stars .",
    "@xcite covered the whole galaxy and had @xmath3 epochs but their photometry did nt go deep enough to detect rr lyrae . for these reasons , there are few variable stars known in fornax with published periods and light curves .",
    "we thus thought that it would be worthwhile to survey a fair fraction of this galaxy and look for variable stars , in particular rr lyrae stars .",
    "imaging observations of fornax were made with the 1 m telescope at siding spring observatory and with the 1.3 m telescope at mount stromlo observatory .",
    "roughly half the epochs of observation came from each telescope .",
    "table  [ tbl_dates ] lists the dates of observation for each field .",
    "the two sets of observations are described separately below .",
    "the part of the data obtained with the 1 m telescope at siding spring observatory was taken during two runs of a few consecutive nights .",
    "we used a site @xmath4 ccd that gives a field of view of @xmath5 ( 0.602 arcsecond per pixel ) .",
    "four fields have been observed in @xmath6 and @xmath7 filters , covering a square on the sky .",
    "the four fields were centered approximately on @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( thus field 1 is north - east , field 2 is north - west , field 3 is south - east and field 4 is south - west ) .",
    "the total area observed is almost half a square degree , covering the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "each field has been observed between one and four times per night , with a typical exposure time of 10 minutes , resulting in about 12 to 15 exposures per field .",
    "our average seeing is 2  , with the best value being 1.5  . during two nights",
    "we also observed standard stars taken from the list of @xcite .",
    "the data have been processed in a standard way using iraf procedures .",
    "we performed aperture photometry for the standard stars and solved the transformation equations between the instrumental and standard systems .",
    "we obtained @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the magnitude of the standard star , @xmath14 is the actually observed magnitude , @xmath15 is the airmass and @xmath16 is the color of the star .",
    "the residuals were 0.010 @xmath17 in @xmath6 and 0.011 @xmath17 in @xmath18 .",
    "the extinction coefficients are close to the average values found for sso @xcite and the color terms are virtually identical to those found by @xcite for the particular camera and filter set that we used .",
    "the photometry for each fornax frame was extracted using dophot @xcite in fixed position mode .",
    "we first created a `` template '' frame for each field .",
    "each template is the average of 4 - 6 good seeing images .",
    "photometry was done on this deep template and the star list of the template was used as input for the photometry of each program frame .",
    "then all images were put on the same zero - point ( still in the instrumental system ) .",
    "we applied an aperture correction to these magnitudes and eqs  ( [ eq_mv ] ) and ( [ eq_mi ] ) were inverted to provide calibrated photometry for each frame .",
    "we estimate that our absolute zero point is accurate to @xmath19 .",
    "we obtained 20 images with the wide - field camera mounted on the mount stromlo observatory 50  telescope ( mso ) .",
    "this camera was used by the macho project and is a mosaic of four 2k@xmath202k ccd with a pixel scale of 0.628/pixel , covering approximately @xmath21 .",
    "a feature of this camera is a dichroic mirror that allows to obtain simultaneous measurements in two passbands , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , corresponding ( very roughly ) to @xmath6 and @xmath24 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for descriptions of the camera system and filters .",
    "the exposure time was 10 minutes for each image .",
    "the typical seeing was 2.2  .",
    "photometry was also performed in fixed - position mode and the frames were then put on a common zero point .",
    "since the passbands are non - standard , we needed to calibrate @xmath22 and @xmath23 to @xmath6 and @xmath18 .",
    "for this we could use our already calibrated photometry from the 1 m sso telescope .",
    "the passbands @xmath22 and @xmath23 are quite broad but they have been calibrated to @xmath6 and @xmath24 ( bessell & germany 1999 , alcock et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the areas covered with each telescope / instrument combination are virtually identical , thus we have @xmath1 and @xmath25 photometry for most stars .",
    "figure  [ fig_vrmvi ] illustrates the procedure we used to calibrate the color @xmath26 to @xmath27 . for each chip , we constructed plots like fig .",
    "[ fig_vrmvi ] and plots of @xmath28 vs @xmath26 .",
    "the `` knee '' at @xmath29 can already be found in @xcite in a @xmath30 vs @xmath31 diagram ( their fig .",
    "this knee also happens when we use @xmath27 since there is an almost linear relation between @xmath27 and @xmath32 .",
    "we then made separate fits for stars bluer and redder than @xmath33 .",
    "for blue stars ( @xmath34 ) a typical calibration would be    @xmath35    and for red stars",
    "( @xmath36 )    @xmath37    from chip to chip there were slight differences in the coefficients , amounting to a few percents at most .",
    "our separate chip - by - chip calibration might not have been warranted ( the approach followed by bessell & germany 1999 ) .",
    "however , we certainly do not lose accuracy in the process , it is only a little more cumbersome .",
    "after the calibration of the whole data set an astrometric calibration was done , using the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite giving residuals between 0.3 and 0.5 arcseconds .    with calibrated photometry in hand , the last step is to apply a reddening correction .",
    "given the high galactic latitude of fornax ( @xmath38 ) , the average reddening should be very low .",
    "we thus used the maps of @xcite to determine the reddening to every star in our data set . the average @xmath39 is around 0.025 mag .",
    "we used the method proposed by @xcite .",
    "it makes use of the fact that when a star is brighter ( or fainter ) than average in one passband it is also brighter ( fainter ) than average in another passband .",
    "the variability index @xmath40 has been computed for each star , and fig  [ fig_iws ] presents the results .",
    "fig  [ fig_cmdvar ] shows the color - magnitude diagram with the variables we have identified .",
    "fornax has five globular clusters @xcite , two of which are in our field ( cluster 2 and cluster 4 ) .",
    "however it was impossible to find variables in these clusters , because of the exceedingly high density of stars .",
    "while it is possible to resolve some stars in cluster 2 ( no star could be resolved in cluster 4 ) , the effect of a varying seeing made the photometry extremely unreliable , although we found one candidate long period variable in cluster 2 .",
    "detection of rr lyrae in fornax s globular clusters can only be done with a much better spatial resolution than we have .",
    "the probability of detecting a variable star depends on a number of things , an important one being the actual time distribution of the observations , since this can affect the detection of some periods more than others .",
    "we carried out numerical simulations ( much in the spirit of saha & hoessel , 1990 ) to estimate the impact that our sampling may have on the discovery of variable stars .",
    "for a star of period @xmath41 and initial phase @xmath42 ( phase at the time of the first observation ) , we can compute the phase at each of our observations .",
    "we then determine which of the following criteria are fulfilled :    1 .",
    "at least 3 observations between phases 0 and 0.2 ( @xmath43 corresponds to maximum light ) 2 .",
    "at least 2 phases between 0.2 and 0.5 ( descending light ) 3 .",
    "at least 3 phases between 0.5 and 0.8 ( around minimum light ) 4 .   at least 15 measurements in total    for all periods between 0.1 and 50 days , and for all initial phases ,",
    "we simply count the number of observations satisfying each criterion , after having attributed a weight to each observation : we estimate that the _ photometric _ detection efficiency of the sso 40 ",
    "data is 0.8 , and 0.4 for the mso 50  data .",
    "this means that , for instance , four actual sso 40 ",
    "observations are nedded to satisfy criterion 1 . for each period",
    "we then count the number of phases that fulfill these criteria .",
    "after appropriate normalization , we obtain a period spectrum which is simply the probability of detecting a star as a function of period ( see fig  [ fig_effic ] ) .",
    "we selected all stars in a broad region around the horizontal branch in order to look for rr lyrae variables .",
    "specifically the criteria were @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "our data are somewhat inhomogeneous in the sense that that sso 40  data are of better quality than the mso 50  data . in the search for rr lyrae",
    "we thus used only sso data when computing the @xmath40 index .",
    "the value @xmath47 has been chosen as a compromise between finding the largest number of genuine variables while minimizing the number of false detections .",
    "it can be seen from fig  [ fig_iws ] that the bulk of the stars are below @xmath47 . applying the criteria given above yielded 851 objects .",
    "we used the phase - dispersion minimization algorithm ( stellingwerf , 1978 ) to look for periodicity in @xmath6-band data .",
    "a rapid inspection of some light curves revealed that for a fairly large number of candidates no period could give a reasonable light curve .",
    "this is because the magnitude of a rr lyrae variable is close to the detection limit of our photometry .",
    "we thus decided to apply a conservative approach and to select the best period by examining each light curve .",
    "this led to rejecting a fairly large number of candidates .",
    "our goal was to produce a reasonably clean sample of rr lyrae , not a complete one . among the stars rejected",
    ", a significant number may be genuine rr lyrae .",
    "the main reason to reject a candidate variable was the total number of measurements per star . among the rejected candidates , 48% had less than 25 measurements whereas 75% of the confirmed rr lyrae have more than 25 data points .",
    "there is no obvious correlation between the value of the variability index @xmath40 and the probability of finding a period .",
    "this is because we used @xmath48 epochs to construct the index @xmath40 ( only sso 40  data ) .",
    "some stars may show a large @xmath40 but may have only 15 measurements , making it difficult to find a reliable period .",
    "the second reason for rejecting a variable is aliasing .",
    "for some stars it was impossible to decide between two periods .",
    "in particular , for a given frequency @xmath49 , the light curves for @xmath50 or @xmath51 would be almost as convincing as @xmath49 . in the end",
    ", this selection yielded 515 rr lyrae stars for which one single frequency could be clearly identified , hence 60% of our candidates turned out to be `` good '' rr lyrae variables .",
    "they are listed in table  [ tbl_rrl ] where we give the phase - weighted average magnitudes and associated uncertainties .",
    "some light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_lcrr ] .",
    "when considering the @xmath18-band light curves in this figure , it is quite remarkable that the welch - stetson method still works , even though the variability signal is extremely weak in the @xmath18 band .",
    "this shows that the method is very powerful even at faint magnitudes .",
    "one has to bear in mind that the number of variables is likely to be a lower limit to the total number of rr lyrae stars in fornax . in particular ,",
    "a consequence of the quality of our data ( the average measurement error for a typical rr lyrae variable is @xmath52 ) is that our survey is probably biased against rrc variables , which have a low amplitude",
    ". this will affect the relative number of rrab and rrc variables but the incompleteness should not depend on period . with better photometric data it will be possible to obtain good light curves for many more rr lyrae .",
    "the period histogram is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_rrhistop ] .",
    "there are two peaks , one at @xmath53 days and one at @xmath54 days .",
    "there seems to be a gap between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the probability of detecting variables with periods around @xmath57 is very low but for periods @xmath58 our detection probability is always larger than 66% of the maximum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_rrhistop ] ) so we should be able to discover variables with periods between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , if they exist .",
    "we thus interpret this gap as the transition period from rrab to rrc .",
    "the shortest period for rrab type is thus @xmath56 . given that our data are not good enough to determine the type of variable on the basis of the light curve , we _ defined _ rrab type variables as the stars having periods larger than 0.47 days , and rrc as having periods shorter than 0.47 days .",
    "the number of stars in each category is @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we then determined the average periods @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the longest period for rrab variables is 0.737@xmath63 .    in galactic globular clusters ,",
    "the average period of ab type rr lyrae variables @xmath64 is either near @xmath65 or near @xmath66 ( oosterhoff class i and ii respectively ) .",
    "the surprising fact is that dwarf spheroidal galaxies do not fall in either of these categories . from table  7 in @xcite",
    ", one sees that all dwarf spheroidal galaxies are intermediate between oo i and oo ii categories . adding the result of @xcite for leo ii ( @xmath67 ) and the present value of @xmath68 for fornax only reinforces this statement .",
    "the average properties of rr lyrae variables are related to their metallicity .",
    "there are relations between several characteristic periods ( longest , shortest , average ) and the metal content @xcite . for the shortest period one",

    "all these values of [ fe / h ] are on the butler - blanco metallicity scale ( used by sandage ) which is more metal - rich than the widely used scale of @xcite by 0.2 dex .",
    "when considering in particular the average period @xmath64 , there is some scatter in this relation , about 0.2 dex ( see siegel & majewski 2000 , their figure 6 , which also displays the other eight dwarf spheroidal galaxies ) .",
    "our estimates of the metal abundance cluster around @xmath73 , we will then take as a final value @xmath2 } = -1.6 \\pm 0.2 $ ] .",
    "in contrast with this small dispersion in [ fe / h ] is the fairly large dispersion in average magnitudes for rr lyrae stars ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this is significantly larger than what is observed in other dwarf spheroidal galaxies [ e.g. @xmath75 in leo ii ",
    "@xcite , @xmath76 in sculptor  @xcite ] .",
    "it seems likely that photometric scatter is reponsible for the dispersion in @xmath77 .",
    "we found a number of variables slightly or significantly brighter than the horizontal branch , most of which are anomalous cepheids ( acs ) or population ii cepheids .",
    "their magnitudes and periods are given in table  [ tab_acs ] .",
    "we found 6 pop ii cepheids ( one unsure ) , 17 anomalous cepheids ( one unsure ) and one blue variable",
    "whose nature is unclear .",
    "the position of a variable in the period - luminosity diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pl ] ) is determined by its metallicity and pulsation mode ( e.g. nemec et al 1994 ) .",
    "fornax has a large range in [ fe / h ] and it has had a complex star formation history @xcite .",
    "this means that cepheids in this galaxy can have a range of ages and/or metallicities .",
    "unfortunately , in the absence of any information on [ fe / h ] it is impossible to assign a pulsation mode to these variables . by looking at fig  [ fig_pl ]",
    "it is clear however that there must be a range of metallicity among these stars .",
    "some of the extreme stars in fig .",
    "[ fig_pl ] could be metal - poor and overtone pulsators while others are metal - rich and fundamental pulsators .",
    "there is a surprising correlation between the specific frequency of anomalous cepheids and the luminosity of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "according to this relation , about a dozen anomalous cepheids should have been found .",
    "we found 17 , fairly close to the prediction and not large ( nor small ) enough to destroy the correlation found by @xcite .",
    "the nature of anomalous cepheids is unclear .",
    "they are found in systems where the most massive stars still burning nuclear fuel are @xmath78 , however the masses of anomalous cepheids are around @xmath79 ( e.g. wallerstein & cox 1984 , bono et al .",
    "1997 ) the two explanations usually put forward to explain their large masses are that they are intermediate - age stars or that they are the product of a binary star merging ( the two component having the mass of a turn - off star ) .",
    "fornax has an important intermediate - age population so the first hypothesis is perfectly plausible , however it is not easy to rule out the second possibility .",
    "a remarkable fact is that , among the nine dwarf galaxies satellites of the milky way , fornax is the only one containing pop .",
    "ii cepheids .",
    "these stars are in a short - lived evolutionary stage and fornax is probably the only dwarf galaxy that is massive enough to have a few of these stars .",
    "there has already been a wide - field survey for long period variables ( lpvs ) in fornax @xcite .",
    "they covered the whole galaxy and found 30 variables .",
    "it was based on photographic plates obtained at the uk schmidt telescope and they acknowledge the fact that `` a certain number of bright variables must have been missed ... because of blended images '' .",
    "it thus seemed worthwhile to look specifically for bright red variables showing a long - term trend , even though our sampling is far from ideal for these stars .",
    "@xcite presented a list of very red stars in fornax .",
    "based on two @xmath6 measurements separated by 132 days , they could flag some of these stars as candidate variables .",
    "we also tried to recover objects from that paper .",
    "eighty five stars turn out to be reasonably good candidates .",
    "they are given in table  [ tbl_lpv ] . in this table",
    ", a question mark means that the variability is not certain ; this happens particularly for crowded stars .",
    "given that our data do not allow to obtain periods for such objects , the classification as lpvs is only tentative .",
    "however , given their magnitudes and colors , most objects in table  [ tbl_lpv ] are good candidates . in this table",
    "we also indicate the numbers given by @xcite in their table  1 for red stars .",
    "we have data for 19 variables listed by @xcite , 3 of which appear non variable in our data simply because we do nt have enough measurements .",
    "the remaining 11 stars in the list of demers & irwin are not in our survey area . in addition",
    "we find 38 good candidate lpvs and 28 possible variables ( indicated with a ? in table  [ tbl_lpv ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_lpv ] we show two examples of lpvs .",
    "there are a few dozens of red giants ( @xmath80 ) showing some variability ( i.e. with @xmath81 ) , most with small amplitude ( less than 0.1 @xmath17 ) .",
    "variability along the red giant branch has been detected in a number of cases in galactic field and globular clusters giants ( e.g. smith & dupree 1988 and references therein ) , however it is not clear whether this is related to pulsation , spots , or any other mechanism .",
    "the typical periods of these objects are likely to be in the range of days to weeks , where our ability to find a period is seriously affected by the sampling ( see fig  [ fig_effic ] ) .",
    "we have presented a survey of @xmath82 square degree covering the central region of the fornax dwarf galaxy . we found and determined periods for 17 anomalous cepheids , 6 population ii cepheids and more than 500 rr lyrae .",
    "in addition , 85 lpv candidates were identified .",
    "it is almost certain that there are more rr lyrae in this galaxy : the accuracy of our data do not allow us to produce a complete catalog of rr lyrae .",

    "we can use the known distance to fornax ( @xmath83 with the tip of the red giant branch , bersier 2000 ) to estimate the brightness of rr lyrae . with an average magnitude of @xmath84 , one obtains @xmath85 .",
    "this is intermediate between other estimates of the magnitude of rr lyrae stars .",
