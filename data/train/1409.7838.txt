    "according to contemporary cosmology , the universe is made of about @xmath5 dark energy , @xmath6 dark matter , and @xmath7 baryonic ( visible ) matter @xcite .",
    "thus , the overwhelming preponderance of matter and energy in the universe is believed to be dark , i.e. unobservable by telescopes .",
    "the dark energy is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "its origin is mysterious and presumably related to the cosmological constant or to some form of exotic fluid with negative pressure such as the chaplygin gas @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "dark matter is necessary to account for the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies @xcite .",
    "its nature is one of the most important puzzles in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "many candidates for dark matter have been proposed , the most popular ones being the axions and the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite .",
    "dark matter is usually modeled as a cold classical collisionless gas with vanishing pressure . in the cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "model , primordial density fluctuations are generated during the inflation and become the seeds of the bottom - up structure formation model . the cdm model with a cosmological constant ( @xmath8cdm )",
    "successfully describes the accelerated expansion of the universe , the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and the large - scale structures of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , it seems to encounter many problems at the scale of galactic or sub - galactic structures . indeed , cdm simulations @xcite lead to @xmath9 cuspy density profiles at galactic centers ( in the scales of the order of @xmath10 kpc and smaller ) while most rotation curves indicate a smooth core density @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted number of satellite galaxies around each galactic halo is far beyond what we see around the milky way @xcite .",
    "these problems might be solved , without altering the virtues of the cdm model , if the dark matter is composed of quantum particles such as fermions ( e.g. massive neutrinos ) or bosons ( e.g. axions ) .",
    "the wave properties of the dark matter may stabilize the system against gravitational collapse providing halo cores instead of cuspy profiles .",
    "in these models , the formation of dark matter structures at small scales is suppressed by quantum mechanics . therefore",
    ", quantum mechanics could be a way to solve the problems of the cdm model such as the cusp problem and the missing satellite problem .",
    "some authors have proposed that dark matter is a gas of bosons at @xmath11 forming bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . in this scenario ,",
    "dark matter halos may be understood as the ground state of some gigantic bosonic atom where the boson particles are condensed in a single macroscopic quantum state @xmath12 . at the scale of galaxies ,",
    "gravity can be treated with the newtonian framework so the evolution of the wave function @xmath13 is governed by the gross - pitaevskii - poisson ( gpp ) system . using the madelung @xcite transformation , the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite turns out to be equivalent to hydrodynamic ( euler ) equations involving an isotropic pressure due to short - range interactions ( scattering ) and an anisotropic quantum pressure arising from the heisenberg uncertainty principle . at large scales ,",
    "quantum effects are negligible and one recovers the classical hydrodynamic equations of the cdm model which are remarkably successful in explaining the large - scale structures of the universe . at small scales , gravitational collapse is prevented by the repulsive scattering of the bosons or by the uncertainty principle .",
    "this model could solve the cusp problem and the missing satellites problem .",
    "the possibility that dark matter could be in the form of becs has a long history @xcite . in some works @xcite , it is assumed that the bosons have no self - interaction . in that case , gravitational collapse is prevented by the heisenberg uncertainty principle which is equivalent to a quantum pressure .",
    "this leads to dark matter halos with a mass - radius relation @xmath14 @xcite . in order to account for the mass and size of dark matter halos ( typically @xmath15 and @xmath16 )",
    ", the mass of the bosons must be extremely small , of the order of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "ultralight scalar fields like axions may have such small masses ( multidimensional string theories predict the existence of bosonic particles down to masses of the order of @xmath18 ) .",
    "this corresponds to `` fuzzy cold dark matter '' @xcite . in other works @xcite",
    ", it is assumed that the bosons have a repulsive self - interaction measured by a scattering length @xmath19 . in that case",
    ", gravitational collapse is prevented by the pressure arising from the scattering . in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , which amounts to neglecting the quantum pressure , the resulting structure is equivalent to a polytrope of index @xmath20 .",
    "the radius of the halo is given by @xmath21 , independent on its mass @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath23 , corresponding to the values of the scattering length observed in terrestrial bec experiments @xcite , the mass and size of dark matter halos are reproduced if the bosons have a mass @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this mass is much larger than the mass @xmath17 required in the absence of self - interaction .",
    "this may be more realistic from a particle physics point of view .",
    "the general mass - radius relation of self - gravitating becs at @xmath11 with an arbitrary scattering length @xmath25 , connecting the non - interacting limit ( @xmath26 ) to the tf limit ( @xmath27 ) , has been determined analytically and numerically in @xcite .",
    "these papers also provide the general density profile of dark matter halos interpreted as self - gravitating becs at @xmath11 .",
    "however , the bec scenario encounters serious problems . in the non - interacting case",
    ", the mass of the bosons must be extremely small , of the order of @xmath17 , in order to reproduce the properties of dark matter halos .",
    "the existence of particles with such small masses remains dubious ( although not impossible a priori ) .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the halo decreases with the radius which is in contradiction with the observations that reveal that the mass increases with the radius . on the other hand , for self - interacting becs in the tf approximation ,",
    "the radius of the halos turns out to be independent on their mass , and fixed by the properties of the bosons ( their mass and scattering length ) .",
    "this is a major drawback of the bec model because it implies that all the halos should have the same radius ( unless the characteristics of the bosons change from halo to halo ) , which is clearly not the case .",
    "it is possible that the bec model at @xmath11 describes only dwarf dark matter halos . in order to describe large halos ,",
    "finite temperature effects should be taken into account ( see also footnote 4 ) .",
    "finite temperature effects in the self - gravitating bose gas have been studied in @xcite using different approaches . when temperature effects are included in the model",
    ", the system takes a core - halo structure with a small condensed core ( equivalent to a bec at @xmath11 ) surrounded by an extended isothermal atmosphere of non - condensed bosons .",
    "these structures may be more realistic to describe dark matter halos .",
    "another possible scenario is that dark matter is made of fermions ( such as massive neutrinos ) instead of bosons .",
    "this model also solves the cusp problem and the missing satellite problem . in that case",
    ", gravitational collapse is prevented by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the distribution function satisfies @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the spin multiplicity of the quantum states ( in the numerical applications , we shall take @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "the fact that the distribution function is bounded implies that the density can not diverge . at @xmath11 ,",
    "the halos are completely degenerate and , except for a matter of scales , they are similar to classical white dwarf stars where gravitational collapse is prevented by the quantum pressure of the electrons @xcite .",
    "their mass - radius relation is @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this model could describe dwarf dark matter halos .",
    "however , in order to describe large halos , like in the case of the bosonic scenario , it may be necessary to consider the fermi gas at finite temperature .",
    "indeed , the mass of a self - gravitating fermi gas at @xmath11 decreases with its size which is not consistent with observations .",
    "a detailed study of phase transitions in the self - gravitating fermi gas at finite temperature has been performed by chavanis @xcite .",
    "this study shows how a degenerate compact object forms as the energy and the temperature are reduced .",
    "originally , the self - gravitating fermi gas at finite temperature with neutrino masses in the @xmath33 range was proposed as a model for dark matter halos ( e.g. @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "then , it was suggested that degenerate superstars composed of weakly interacting fermions in the @xmath36 range could be an alternative to the supermassive black holes that are reported to exist at the center of galaxies ( e.g. @xmath37 and @xmath38 in our galaxy ) @xcite .",
    "finally , it was argued that a weakly interacting fermionic gas at finite temperature could provide a self - consistent model of dark matter that describes both the center and the halo of the galaxies @xcite . in that model",
    ", the system has a core - halo structure with a small condensed core ( equivalent to a fermion ball at @xmath11 ) surrounded by an extended isothermal atmosphere .",
    "since the density of a self - gravitating isothermal gas decreases as @xmath39 at large distances @xcite , this model is consistent with the flat rotation curves of the galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "since the core is degenerate in the sense of quantum mechanics ( pauli exclusion principle ) , it leads to flat density profiles at the center and avoids the cusp problem of cdm models .",
    "in addition , the gravitational collapse of fermionic matter leads to a compact object ( fermion ball ) at the center of galaxies that could be an alternative to a central black hole @xcite .",
    "one difficulty with the finite temperature self - gravitating bose and fermi gases is to explain how the particles have thermalized and how they have reached a statistical equilibrium state .",
    "indeed , the collisional relaxation time of a self - gravitating halo is usually very large and exceeds the age of the universe by many orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "to solve this timescale problem , we propose that dark matter halos can be treated as a collisionless gas having experienced a form of violent relaxation .",
    "this process , introduced by lynden - bell @xcite in stellar dynamics , and worked out in @xcite , leads to a distribution function similar to the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the coarse - grained distribution function satisfies @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the initial value of the distribution function before mixing . in that case ,",
    "the origin of `` degeneracy '' is due to dynamical constraints ( liouville s theorem ) instead of quantum mechanics ( pauli s principle ) .",
    "this theory was initially developed to describe collisionless stellar systems such as elliptical galaxies for which the non - degenerate limit may be the most relevant @xcite .",
    "however , this approach with dynamical degeneracy retained could also apply to dark matter halos @xcite . in that case ,",
    "gravitational collapse is prevented by lynden - bell s type of exclusion principle .",
    "furthermore , this scenario provides a much more efficient relaxation mechanism than the fermionic scenario .",
    "indeed , the violent relaxation of collisionless systems ( leading to the lynden - bell statistics ) takes place on a few dynamical times while the collisional relaxation of fermions ( leading to the fermi - dirac statistics ) is very long and possibly exceeds the age of the universe by many orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , it is not clear how the fermions have thermalized in the whole cluster .",
    "in addition , in the fermionic scenario , the thermodynamical temperature @xmath42 is expected to be very low so that the halos would be completely degenerate and would appear very different from what is observed ( except in the case of dwarf halos ) .",
    "by contrast , in lynden - bell s theory , the temperature is an effective out - of - equilibrium temperature @xmath43 that can be much larger than the thermodynamical temperature .",
    "this could account for the value of the temperature inferred from the rotation curves of the galaxies by using the virial theorem .",
    "therefore , the lynden - bell theory predicts a large effective temperature ( even if @xmath11 initially ) , a density profile decreasing as @xmath39 at large distances consistent with the flat rotation curves of galaxies , and an effective exclusion principle at short distances that could avoid the cusp problem and lead to fermion balls mimicking black holes , just like in the fermionic scenario @xcite . as a result",
    ", the lynden - bell theory has the same properties as the fermionic theory while solving the timescale problem and the temperature problem @xcite .",
    "this makes this scenario very attractive .",
    "described by the schrdinger - poisson equation undergoes gravitational collapse ( jeans instability ) , oscillates , and settles into a compact bosonic object through the radiation of a complex scalar field . as a result ,",
    "the system reaches a qss made of a solitonic core surrounded by a halo made of scalar radiation .",
    "the halo is similar to a thermal halo so this process may explain how self - gravitating bosons can `` thermalize '' and acquire a large effective temperature @xmath43 even if @xmath11 formally . the presence of the radiative halo may also explain why the mass of the halos increase with their radius .",
    "in the analogy between bosons and fermions , the soliton corresponds to the fermion ball and the halo made of scalar radiation corresponds to the isothermal halo predicted by lynden - bell s theory . ]",
    "the dark matter halos formed by jeans instability and violent relaxation can merge and create bigger structures .",
    "this is called hierarchical clustering .",
    "this is also a process of violent relaxation .",
    "if dark matter is collisionless , a large halo should not evolve anymore after having reached a virialized state . as a result , it can not have very high densities . in order to be more general , and because very little is known concerning the nature of dark matter , we consider the possibility that the core of dark matter halos can be collisional @xcite .",
    "this seems to be necessary to explain the presence of black holes at the center of large dark matter halos as proposed by balberg _",
    "when collisional effects are taken into account , dark matter halos behave similarly to globular clusters . however , the collisions between particles do not correspond to two - body encounters as in globular clusters but rather to collisions similar to those in a gas . on the other hand , in fermionic dark matter halos ,",
    "the pauli exclusion principle must be taken into account . as a result",
    ", collisions tend to establish a fermi - dirac distribution at finite temperature .",
    "this distribution is not very different from lynden - bell s distribution but collisions allow the central concentration of the system to evolve in time towards large values .    in a recent series of papers , de vega and sanchez",
    "@xcite compared the predictions of the finite temperature self - gravitating fermi gas with observations of dark matter halos .",
    "they argued that small halos are degenerate quantum objects while large halos are non degenerate classical objects . assuming that the smallest known halos are completely degenerate , they found that the mass of the fermions must be of the order of @xmath44 corresponding possibly to sterile neutrinos . concerning the rotation curves , they obtained encouraging results showing that the description of dark matter halos in terms of the fermi - dirac distribution may be a good starting point .",
    "@xcite at large distances while the density profile of dark matter halos decreases as @xmath4 @xcite . ]",
    "de vega and sanchez justify the fermi - dirac distribution by quantum mechanics ( for a system of fermions at statistical equilibrium ) although , as explained above , it may be due to lynden - bell s form of relaxation .",
    "we shall consider the two possibilities since they lead to similar distribution functions @xcite .",
    "actually , quantum degeneracy and lynden - bell s type of degeneracy compete with each other @xcite .",
    "is fundamentally fixed by quantum mechanics ( pauli ) .",
    "indeed , the maximum distribution function of the spatially homogeneous collisionless gas prior to violent relaxation is @xmath45 since the gas has a relativistic fermi distribution @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lynden - bell bound is equal to half the pauli bound : @xmath47 . ] in their study , de vega and sanchez use the usual fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "however , when coupled to gravity , this distribution has infinite mass so that it can not constitute a physical model .",
    "furthermore , this infinite mass problem precludes the possibility of studying the stability of the cluster ( except if we enclose the cluster within an artificial `` box '' ) . for these reasons ,",
    "we propose , as a next step , to describe dark matter halos by the fermionic king model which is a truncated fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "this model was introduced independently by ruffini and stella @xcite and chavanis @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as a generalization of the classical king model to the case of fermions .",
    "this model has a finite mass so it is more realistic than the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the fermionic king model can be derived @xcite from a kinetic equation ( the fermionic landau equation ) assuming that the particles leave the system when their energy overcomes a critical escape energy @xmath48 .",
    "this derivation is valid both for quantum particles ( fermions ) and for collisionless self - gravitating systems undergoing lynden - bell s form of violent relaxation . in the non - degenerate limit",
    ", the fermionic king model reduces to the classical king model .    the classical king model @xcite was introduced in the context of stellar systems in order to describe globular clusters made of classical point mass stars . on the basis of thermodynamics",
    ", we would expect that a system of classical point mass stars in gravitational interaction reaches a statistical equilibrium state described by the boltzmann distribution .",
    "however , it is well - known that no statistical equilibrium state exist for self - gravitating systems because the boltzmann entropy has no maximum in an unbounded domain ( the isothermal sphere , corresponding to the boltzmann distribution coupled to the poisson equation , has infinite mass ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems is essentially an out - of - equilibrium problem @xcite .",
    "the absence of statistical equilibrium state is related to the fact that self - gravitating systems such as globular clusters have the tendency to evaporate . however , evaporation is a slow process and a globular cluster can be found , for intermediate times , in a quasi stationary state close to the michie - king distribution @xcite which is a truncated boltzmann distribution with parameters slowly changing with time .",
    "the caloric curve of the king model was determined by katz @xcite . like in the case of",
    "box - confined isothermal spheres @xcite , equilibrium states exist only above a critical energy @xmath0 .",
    "these configurations are metastable but their lifetime is considerable since it scales as @xmath49 ( except close to the critical point ) @xcite . for globular clusters , for which @xmath50 , this lifetime is so large that metastable states can be considered as stable states . in this sense",
    ", we can say that self - gravitating systems with @xmath51 do reach a statistical equilibrium state described by a truncated boltzmann distribution ( even if there is no statistical equilibrium state in a strict sense ) .",
    "however , because of evaporation , the energy of a self - gravitating system slowly decreases . for @xmath2 ,",
    "there is no equilibrium state anymore .",
    "therefore , when the energy passes below this threshold , the system undergoes a gravothermal catastrophe @xcite and experiences core collapse @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a saddle - node bifurcation . for classical self - gravitating systems , such as globular clusters",
    ", core collapse leads to the formation of a binary star surrounded by a hot halo ( at the collapse time , the singular density profile has infinite central density but zero central mass ) @xcite .",
    "the binary can release sufficient energy to stop the collapse and even drive a re - expansion of the cluster in a post - collapse regime @xcite .",
    "this is followed by a series of gravothermal oscillations @xcite .",
    "it is estimated that about @xmath52 of globular clusters are described by the king model while @xmath53 have undergone core collapse @xcite . for self - gravitating systems made of fermions ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , dark matter halos ) ,",
    "the collapse stops when the core of the system becomes degenerate in virtue of the pauli exclusion principle . in that case",
    ", we have to take quantum mechanics into account .",
    "to treat dark matter , we propose to use the fermionic king model @xcite .",
    "the fermionic king model was studied by ruffini and stella @xcite who determined the density profiles of dark matter halos for various values of the central potential .",
    "our series of papers is intended to complete their study in the following directions .",
    "we determine the caloric curves of the fermionic king model for arbitrary values of the degeneracy parameter and study in detail the phase transitions that may occur between a gaseous phase unaffected by quantum mechanics and a condensed phase dominated by quantum mechanics . in this way",
    ", we generalize the study of phase transitions in the self - gravitating fermi gas at finite temperature confined within a box performed by chavanis @xcite .",
    "this generalization is important since the fermionic king model provides a more relevant description of dark matter halos than box models .",
    "therefore , we obtain realistic caloric curves of dark matter halos .",
    "we also determine the density profile , the velocity dispersion profile , and the circular velocity profile of the different configurations in order to compare the predictions of the fermionic king model to the observations of dark matter halos . in the present paper ( paper i ) , we consider the non - degenerate limit corresponding to the classical king model .",
    "the non - degenerate limit is expected to be valid for large dark matter halos so that it is a good starting point . in our companion paper @xcite ( paper ii )",
    ", we consider the fermionic king model for arbitrary values of the degeneracy parameter .",
    "degeneracy effects are expected to be important for dwarf and intermediate - size dark matter halos .",
    "a short account of our results is given in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_sm ] , we discuss models of dark matter halos based on statistical mechanics and we introduce the classical and fermionic king models . in sec .",
    "[ sec_gen ] , we formulate the general problem of determining the structure of a spherically symmetric self - gravitating system described by a distribution function of the form @xmath54 with @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the individual energy of the particles .",
    "we introduce the `` generalized entropy '' associated to this distribution and discuss its physical interpretation . in secs .",
    "[ sec_kingclass]-[sec_improper ] , we apply this general formalism to the classical king model and compute several quantities of interest .",
    "we show that the king model leads to configurations with an isothermal core , an isothermal halo , and a polytropic envelope of index @xmath57 . in sec .",
    "[ sec_comp ] , we compare the predictions of the classical king model to the observations of dark matter halos . because of collisions and evaporation , the central density increases while the slope of the halo profile decreases until an instability takes place .",
    "we show that dark matter halos are relatively well - described by a king model at , or close to , the point of marginal microcanonical stability . at that point ,",
    "the king model generates a density profile that can be approximated by the modified hubble profile @xcite .",
    "this profile has a flat core and decreases as @xmath4 at large distances , like the observational burkert @xcite profile .",
    "less steep halos are unstable .",
    "the flat core is due to finite temperature effects , not to quantum mechanics . on the other hand ,",
    "the large distance behavior of the density profile is due to the polytropic nature of the king distribution at high energies that departs from the isothermal boltzmann distribution .",
    "we conclude that statistical mechanics provides a good description of dark matter halos when evaporation is taken into account .",
    "the agreement is very good in the core of the system that is well - relaxed .",
    "the discrepancies that remain in the halo may be interpreted as a result of an incomplete relaxation , like in the case of stellar systems .",
    "although our results are exposed in the context of dark matter halos , our study of the classical king model presented in this paper also applies to globular clusters .",

    "this is the subject of paper ii .",
    "it is shown that gravitational collapse leads to the formation of a degenerate compact object ( fermion ball ) with a much smaller mass and radius than the original halo , accompanied by the expulsion of a hot and massive envelope .",
    "indeed , by collapsing , the fermion ball releases an enormous energy that heats the envelope . as a result , the envelope is ejected , and dispersed , at very large distances so that , at the end , only the degenerate nucleus remains .",
    "this process is reminiscent of the formation of red - giants and to the supernova explosion phenomenon , but it occurs on a cosmological scale and is considerably much slower ( of the order of the hubble time ) .",
    "this could be a mechanism of formation of dwarf dark matter halos that are completely degenerate .",
    "one important result of our study in paper ii is that large dark matter halos can not harbor a fermion ball , unlike the proposition that has been made in the past @xcite , because the `` nucleus - halo '' structures that have been considered by these authors are unreachable : they correspond to saddle points of entropy at fixed mass and energy .",
