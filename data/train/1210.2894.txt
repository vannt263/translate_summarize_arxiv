    "the dirac equation unified special relativity with quantum mechanics for fermions .",
    "it was a step further beyond the schrdinger equation due to its invariance with respect to lorentz boosts .",
    "several early experimental successes of it were the accurate prediction of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron , the prediction of antiparticles and the correct description for the fine - structure of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom .",
    "these were based on a form of the dirac equation which describes relativistic electrons .",
    "there exists a similar form of it , which offers a phenomenological description of some compound particles like the neutron and the proton in the relativistic domain .    despite its successes regarding the relativistic behavior of",
    "the electron , certain solutions of the dirac equation predict some unusual effects , which have not been experimentally measured so far for neither the electron , the neutron or any other particle  @xcite . the best known of them are ( i ) klein s paradox  @xcite  the tunneling of a relativistic electron into an infinite potential barrier , and ( ii ) zitterbewegung ( zb ) @xcite  helicoidal motion of the expectation value of the position @xmath0 and oscillatory behavior of the expectation values of the momentum @xmath1 , the spin @xmath2 and the orbital angular momentum of a free electron .",
    "recently these two effects have gathered renewed attention by the scientific community , thanks to several proposals for their experimental emulation in physical systems like solid - state quantum wells  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , graphene  @xcite and optical waveguides  @xcite .",
    "most of the recent work on  is focused on electrons .",
    "in contrast here we consider the dirac equation for neutral particles propagating relativistically in external magnetic and/or electric fields  @xcite along the direction of the applied field .",
    "the dirac equation  @xcite for these particles deviates from the dirac equation for the electron in three aspects : ( i ) the term coupling the electrostatic potential to the charge of the particle dissapears ; ( ii ) the terms coupling the vector potential to the charge and momentum are not present ; ( iii ) a term coupling the anomalous magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) to the magnetic field and a term coupling the eventual electric dipole moment ( edm ) to the electrostatic field appear .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian for a neutral particle in the absence of external fields reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the speed of light , @xmath5 is the rest mass of the particle , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the dirac matrices",
    ". the spectrum of the hamiltonian is doubly degenerate and its eigenvalues are @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that if the initial state is a superposition of both positive and negative energy eigenstates , in the process of evolution the expectation values of velocity , position and spin will oscillate with the same frequency @xmath10 this is the free - particle .",
    "there exists a lower bound @xmath11 for the free - particle  of the three quantities @xmath2 , @xmath12 and @xmath0 . in the literature",
    "@xcite it is usually accepted that the frequency of the free - particle  is approximately @xmath11 . however , for relativistic speed of propagation , @xmath13 becomes comparable to @xmath14 .",
    "then there will be considerable contribution of @xmath13 to the  frequency @xmath15 , eq .  .",
    "the difference @xmath16 between the rest frame ( @xmath17 ) and the observer frame of reference amounts to a _ blue shift _ of the  frequency : it is demonstrated in fig .  [ fig : wzb ] .",
    "therefore , the free - particle  frequency has the opposite behavior of the earlier reported  @xcite relativistic red shift effect for the frequency of larmor precession .",
    "it is a consequence of the relativistic energy - momentum - mass relationship @xmath18 , and the fact that  is observed due to an interference between positive and negative energy solutions .    , eq .",
    ". the  frequency @xmath15 increases with the particle velocity @xmath19 , and respectively , its momentum @xmath20 , @xmath21 . ]",
    "both larmor precession of spin along an external field and spin-  manifest themselves as spin precession .",
    "however , despite their similarity there are important differencies between them .",
    "spin-  is a consequence of interference between positive and negative energy components of the dirac equation , while larmor precession is a consequence of lifting of spin - degeneracy by external fields .",
    "it is natural then to expect some modifications of at least spin- , and eventually position- , when spin degeneracy is lifted by external fields in the dirac equation .",
    "we address these problems by examining a relativistic model of a neutral particle possessing mdm , and eventually edm , placed in an external field , in which the static magnetic and/or electric fields are applied along the propagation direction . working with the @xmath22-direction in si units",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath22-component of the spin vector operator in relativistic theory , @xmath25 is the electric field , @xmath26 is the magnetic field , @xmath27 is the size of the edm and @xmath28 is the size of the mdm of the relativistic particle .",
    "the four distinct eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are    [ eq : eigene ] @xmath29    where .",
    "the four distinct eigenvalues of the hamiltonian correspond to four different frequencies in the matrix elements between the eigenstates ,    @xmath30      the expectation value @xmath33 of the component of the spin vector operator along the propagation direction does not contain an oscillating component .",
    "its value @xmath34 is a constant of motion , determined by the initial conditions .",
    "this is natural since in this geometry @xmath24 is the helicity of the particle .",
    "the expectation value of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 components of the spin operator read ( @xmath37 ) @xmath38 they contain two oscillating terms with different frequencies : a relativistic larmor precession frequency , @xmath39 and a modified spin-  frequency , @xmath40 the presence of two different frequencies for every plane wave component leads to a beating pattern with an angular frequency @xmath41    earlier  @xcite we have reported the existence of an upper bound @xmath42 for the larmor precession frequency of a relativistic neutral particle . on the other hand , the lower bound for the free - particle spin - zitterbwegung is not modified by the coupling of edm and mdm to external fields and therefore it is still @xmath42 .",
    "however , in a realistic situation the two limits can not be achieved by @xmath43 and @xmath44 due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "thus the frequency @xmath45 is a forbidden frequency for spin - precession within the considered model .",
    "below it , spin precession is due to larmor precession , whereas above it , it is because of . for the hamiltonian   the transverse spin components precess with the two frequencies at the same time leading to the beating pattern with beating frequency @xmath46 .    , red shift for larmor precession frequency @xmath43 and blue shift effect for their difference - the spin beating frequency @xmath46 .",
    "the figure is plotted assuming @xmath47    the modified  frequency @xmath44 exhibits a relativistic blue - shift effect similar to the one discussed for free-  frequency and contrary to the larmor precession frequency@xcite , which is subjected to red - shift effect .",
    "the beating frequency @xmath46 also exhibits blue shift effect  it is larger for particles with larger velocity and respectively momentum .",
    "the behavior of the three frequencies versus the velocity is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : sb ] .",
    "while modification of spin - zitterbwegung by mdm - b or edm - e coupling is expected , the modification of orbital dynamics by the coupling of an external magnetostatic / electrostatic field to the spin - degree of freedom is more surprising .",
    "we investigate these by computing the expectation values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) with respect to the superposition  .",
    "we first calculate the modified velocity-  in the schrdinger representation and then the position-  from the expression @xmath51 and integration  @xcite of the expectation value of velocity with respect to time and multiplication by @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that eq",
    ".   leads to two different types of velocity and position : ( a ) _ longitudinal _ for the @xmath22 component of the velocity and position operators here , and ( b ) _ transverse _ for the @xmath35- and @xmath36- components of the velocity and position operators .",
    "they are characterized by different precession frequencies .",
    "the expectation value @xmath52 for the longitudinal velocity-  reads @xmath53 + \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\;\\;\\sumint\\;\\ ; n_2(p_x ) 2\\text{re}\\left[c^*_{+,p,\\downarrow}c_{-,p,\\downarrow}e^{i\\omega_3^{\\text{zb}}t}\\right]\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 . the first term of eq",
    "describes the group velocity of the wavepacket , obtained as the weighted sum of the averaged velocities of the components of the wavepacket  .",
    "the other two terms describe the velocity-  for the hamiltonian  . excluding the initial position , the expectation value of the transverse velocity-  reads @xmath58 + \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\;\\;\\sumint\\;\\ ; n_2(p_x )",
    "2\\text{re}\\left[\\frac{c^*_{+,p,\\downarrow}c_{-,p,\\downarrow}}{i\\omega_3^{\\text{zb}}}e^{i\\omega_3^{\\text{zb}}t}\\right]\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again the first term describes classical motion while the other two describe position- .     and @xmath59 , and red shift effect for their difference - the orbital beating frequency @xmath60 .",
    "plotted assuming @xmath61 .",
    "clearly the longitudinal  frequency @xmath62 can take values below @xmath42 , as well as the  beating frequency @xmath60 . ]    in contrast to the free particle case  @xcite where there is just one frequency for velocity- and position- , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vzsdl ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : pzsdl ] ) there are two different frequencies of longitudinal velocity-  @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ". both of them are different from the free particle  frequency @xmath65 , by a term determined by the size of the spin - splitting @xmath66 . in the rest frame of the particle",
    "they become    @xmath67    obviously , @xmath62 is always greater than the lower limiting frequency of free - particle  @xmath68 , while @xmath69 can take values which are smaller ; this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lz ] . in principle , by application of strong enough magnetic field the longitudinal velocity / position-  frequency can be lowered to the observable range for current technology .",
    "thus when the spin degeneracy of the particle is lifted by an external field , @xmath68 is not a lower limit for velocity / position- , while it is still a lower limit for spin- , as shown above .",
    "furthermore , the presence of two different frequencies in the expressions for longitudinal velocity / position-  leads to the appearance of a beating pattern with an orbital beating frequency @xmath70 the beating frequency is just twice the larmor precession frequency of spin - splitting @xmath71 , which makes the predicted effect readily observable with current technology .",
    "with respect to lorentz transformations of the coordinate systems the two longitudinal velocity / position  frequencies exhibit _ blue shift effect _ similar to the one for the spin-  frequency .",
    "in contrast , the beating frequency , as their difference , manifests relativistic _ red shift effect_. this is the opposite behavior of the beating frequency @xmath46 of spin- .",
    "these dependences of the  frequencies on velocity are plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : lz ] .",
    "the expectation values of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 components of velocity / position have similar structures as the expectation values of spin- .",
    "they have terms with two frequencies @xmath43 and @xmath69 , which are different from the free - particle  and from the longitudinal velocity / position-  frequencies @xmath62 and @xmath59 . the position expectation values reads @xmath72 + \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\;\\;\\sumint\\ \\ \\sum_{s\\neq s ' } 2\\text{re}\\left[\\frac{c^*_{p,+,s'}c_{p,-,s}}{\\text{i}\\omega_2^{\\text{zb}}}\\langle s',+|\\hat{\\alpha}_j|-,s\\rangle e^{i\\omega^{\\text{zb}}_2 t }   \\right]\\label{eq : trexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term in eq .  , with the angular frequency @xmath44 , is easily identified as position- .",
    "it is the result of an overlap between the components of positive and negative energies and of opposite spin / helicity clearly visible in the expectation value of @xmath48 , @xmath37 .",
    "the transverse position-  frequency @xmath73 has the same properties , as the one discussed in the context of spin-  and , in particular , it is subjected to the blue - shift effect .    the first term in eq .   with the angular frequency equal to the larmor frequency @xmath43",
    "is harder to be identified as traditional . while it describes a phenomenon similar to traditional",
    " oscillation in the expectation values of velocity and position , it does not stem from interference between solutions with positive and negative energy . as it is clear from the structure of the matrix element @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) of the velocity operator @xmath48 ( @xmath37 ) , it stems from matrix elements with the same sign of energy but with opposite spin orientations .",
    "explicitly , the matrix elements @xmath74 are given by    @xmath76    where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath79 the amplitude of the oscillations will be dominated by the matrix elements @xmath80 ( @xmath37 ) between the solutions with negative energy .",
    "furthermore , the matrix elements depend on the size of the relativistic larmor frequency @xmath43 , the interaction energy @xmath66 and the momentum of the particle . in the rest frame of the particle ( @xmath17 ) the oscillations disappear .",
    "they also disappear when the interaction energy @xmath66 between the particle mdm / edm and external static field is zero .",
    "this is a feature of relativistic spin splitting .",
    "the lifting of spin degeneracy leads to precessionary motion in the plane transverse to the direction of spin splitting .",
    "this shows that by lifting the spin degeneracy and by the orbital effect of spin splitting it might be possible to observe  with a frequency smaller than the limiting frequency @xmath68 of a free particle .",
    "the combination of two frequencies in the expectation values of @xmath81 leads to the appearance of a beating pattern with a beating frequency @xmath82 .",
    "it has the same properties as the beating frequency of the modified spin- .",
    "the lowering of the  frequency @xmath69 below the free particle limit @xmath68 , as well as the beating frequencies , lay down a route for eventual detection of  phenomena in conventional experiments .",
    "this is further helped by the red - shift effect for the longitudinal beating frequency @xmath83 .",
    "an alternative route for experimental studies of the above effects is quantum simulations . in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have proposed the emulation of the dirac equation with edm in trapped ions .",
    "the same scheme of simulation can be applied to the emulation of the effects considered here .",
    "after the preparation of an appropriate initial state the dynamics can be simulated in the proposed way  @xcite .",
    "the different  frequencies can then be measured using the technique of mapping spatial variables onto the internal states and subsequent measurements of them @xcite .",
    "in this work we pointed out the existence of a _ motional blue - shift effect _ for the  frequency of a free particle .",
    "we predicted the existence of a `` forbidden frequency '' of spin precession in 1d and showed that it is not modified by the presence of external fields .",
    "we also predicted a modification of the frequency of spin- .",
    "we showed that the beating frequency stemming from the combination of spin-  and larmor precession exhibits a _",
    "motional blue - shift effect_. furthermore , we predicted the existence of two different position  phenomena : transverse and longitudinal .",
    "the longitudinal position-  is characterized by two frequencies different from the free particle one @xmath68 and leading to a beating pattern .",
    "we showed that the two  frequencies exhibit a _",
