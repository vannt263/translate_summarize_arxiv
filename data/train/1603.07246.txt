    "is positive and the the sign of atmospheric mass squared difference ( @xmath12 ) is unspecified , we encounter two divisions of qdn patterns : they are ,    * `` quasi - degenerate normal hierarchy ( qdnh ) type '' : @xmath13 , * `` quasi - degenerate inverted hierarchy type '' ( qdih ) : @xmath14 .    besides , the remaining possibilities are strict `` normal hierarchy '' ( nh ) : @xmath15 and `` inverted hierarchy '' ( ih ) : @xmath16 .",
    "the two majorana phases ( @xmath17 ) are admitted to the diagonalized neutrino mass matrix @xmath18 , where , @xmath19 @xcite . on adopting the cp conserving cases , three subclasses corresponding to each model",
    "is generated .",
    "the cp parity patterns of the sub classes are :    * type ia : @xmath20 , * type ib : @xmath21 and , * type ic : @xmath22 .",
    "the qdn model were very often forsaken @xcite in view of the neutrino - less double @xmath6 decay experiments and cosmological data .",
    "the range of absolute neutrino mass scale , @xmath4 was chosen as , @xmath23 @xcite in earlier qdn models .",
    "but , the cosmological data in concern with the sum of the three absolute neutrino masses , @xmath24 @xcite , strongly abandons any possibility of quasi - degenerate neutrinos to exist with absolute mass scale more than @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 corresponding to strict nh and ih scenarios are approximately @xmath27 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "hence the validity of both the models are beyond dispute . in the context of cosmological observation on @xmath28 and the future experiments , we shall try to look into the possibilities related to the reanimation of the qdn models , with comparatively lower mass scale , @xmath29 .    regarding the three unknown absolute masses , only two relations involving @xmath30",
    "are known so far . in nh and ih models ,",
    "this problem can be easily overcome as the lowest mass ( either @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) is set to zero . in case of qdn model",
    ", we consider the largest mass @xmath4 as a input .",
    "besides , there are also three mixing angles : reactor ( @xmath33 ) , solar ( @xmath34 ) and atmospheric ( @xmath35 ) . a general neutrino mass matrix @xmath36 carries the information of all these six quantities .",
    "for a phenomenological analysis of the qdn model , a suitable parametrization of @xmath36 is an essential part .",

    ", @xmath36 is assumed to follow @xmath0 symmetry @xcite .",

    "the expected deviations to @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are controlled from charged lepton sector@xcite .",
    "we hope , this investigation on qdn mass models will serve as a platform for our future study of baryogenesis and leptogenesis @xcite . this investigation will require the knowledge of the texture of left handed neutrino mass matrices , @xmath1 .",
    "the present neutrino oscillation data reports the lepton mixing angles , @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite which are undoubtedly deviated from what tbm mixing and bm mixing says : @xmath41 and @xmath42 . a neutrino mass matrix which satisfies these properties ( of bm / tbm mixing)@xcite , in the basis where charged lepton mass matrix",
    ", @xmath43 is diagonal , @xmath44 , exhibits a @xmath0 interchange symmetry . with a permutation matrix , @xmath45 which conducts a flavor interchange @xmath46",
    ", we express the texture of a @xmath0 symmetric mass matrix as in the following @xcite ,    @xmath47    where,@xmath48 we experience another form @xmath49 @xcite , different from that in eq.([chap2mutau1 ] ) , @xmath50 the matrix element is invariant under the flavor interchange of @xmath51 .",

    "different discrete symmetry groups are very often combined with @xmath0 interchange symmetry in order to obtain a predictive neutrino mass matrix @xcite .",
    "for example , in the original altarelli - feruglio model @xcite , the neutrino mass matrix takes the form ( see eq.([chap2mutau1 ] ) ) ,    @xmath59    the mass eigenvalues are @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 which gives , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . since it is known that @xmath65 , which implies @xmath66 .",

    "this model advocates for normal hierarchy of the absolute neutrino masses .",
    "in addition , it supports for tbm mixing : @xmath70 similarly , a neutrino mass matrix of following kind ( see eq.([chap2mutau1 ] ) ) , @xmath71 can be related with an interesting mixing scheme called golden ratio @xcite and dictates the mass pattern to be of normal hierarchy type .",
    "one of the most interesting property of the @xmath0 ( interchange ) symmetry which is very often neglected is the arbitrariness of the solar angle @xmath34 . with a proper choice of the parameters , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ,",

    "in fact , the recent result @xmath77 @xcite deviated a little from tbm prediction ( @xmath78 ) , can be accommodated within the @xmath0 symmetry regime @xcite . neglecting the small deviations ( though significant ) for @xmath35 and @xmath33 , we first approximate , @xmath79 and the charged lepton diagonalizing matrix , @xmath80 .",
    "this is an undeniable fact that the predictions of a suitable order of absolute neutrino masses are not unique and differs with the choice of models . keeping aside all the models , which associate @xmath49 with different discrete flavour symmetries , here we concentrate on a general parametrization of @xmath49",
    "the idea behind this decoupling is not to overlook the necessity of different symmetry groups , but to look into the subtle aspects of @xmath0 symmetry , starting from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "here we emphasize on the facts that @xmath0 interchange symmetry is not partial to any hierarchy of absolute neutrino masses and has a good control over the solar angle . in the refs.@xcite , we put forward another possible way to parametrize the neutrino mass matrix based on @xmath81-@xmath82 symmetry .    in the present article , concerning the parametrization of the @xmath0 symmetric mass matrices for different hierarchical cases",
