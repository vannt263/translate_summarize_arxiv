    "in addition to issues involved in spontaneous fission , the description of thermal fission in excited nuclei is a more demanding task . from low to high temperatures",
    ", the fission process is gradually evolved from the quantum tunneling to the statistical escape mechanism . for applications ,",
    "the thermal fission has a wide range of interests such as the neutron induced fission in reactors and in astrophysical environments , and fusion reactions for superheavy nuclei .",
    "conventionally , the thermal fission is described by the bohr - wheeler transition - state - theory and later the dynamical kramers theory  @xcite . the imaginary free energy approach ( im__f _ _ ) is a general thermodynamic method to calculate thermal quantum decay rates at all temperatures  @xcite , which has been widely applied to decays of metastable states such as nuclear fissions  @xcite and chemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "these methods rely on inputs of barriers or level densities , which are dependent on temperatures , deformations and shell structures . as a consequence ,",
    "many corrections and associated parameters have been introduced to interpret experimental results .",
    "therefore , a consistent description of thermal fission with microscopic inputs that are free of parameters , from low to high temperatures , is very desirable .    in a microscopic view",

    "this can also be microscopically described but has rarely been discussed .",

    ", we will see that the thermal fission from low to high temperatures can be described in a consistent picture .",
    "presently our studies are restricted to one - dimensional fission although both quadrupole and octupole deformations are included .",
    "indeed , the multi - dimensional fission descriptions are more realistic and computationally more costly . in the semiclassical approximation",
    ", a multi - dimensional tunneling problem can be transformed into an effective one - dimensional problem  @xcite .",

    "<S> background : :    the fission processes of thermal excited nuclei are conventionally    studied by statistical models which rely on inputs of phenomenological    level densities and potential barriers . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the microscopic    descriptions of spontaneous fission and induced fission are very    desirable for a unified understanding of various fission processes . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    we propose to study the fission rates , at both low and high    temperatures , with microscopically calculated temperature - dependent    fission barriers and collective mass parameters . </S>",
    "<S> methods : :    the fission barriers are calculated by the finite - temperature    skyrme - hartree - fock+bcs method . </S>",
    "<S> the mass parameters are calculated by    the temperature - dependent cranking approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal fission    rates can be obtained by the imaginary free energy approach at all    temperatures , in which fission barriers are naturally temperature    dependent . </S>",
    "<S> the fission at low temperatures can be described mainly as    a barrier - tunneling process . while the fission at high temperatures    has to incorporate the reflection above barriers . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    our results of spontaneous fission rates reasonably agree with other    studies and experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependencies of fission    barrier heights and curvatures have been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature    dependent behaviors of mass parameters have also been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the    thermal fission rates from low to high temperatures with a smooth    connection have been given by different approaches . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    since the temperature dependencies of fission barrier heights and    curvatures , and the mass parameters can vary rapidly for different    nuclei , the microscopic descriptions of thermal fission rates are very    valuable . our studies without free parameters provide a consistent    picture to study various fissions such as that in fast - neutron    reactors , astrophysical environments and fusion reactions for    superheavy nuclei .    </S>"
