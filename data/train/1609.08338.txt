    "the tongue then grows steadily until it pinches off and then re - establishes a new stable tongue length ( _ supplemental movie 2 _ ) .",

    "this observation suggests that there are limited particle rearrangements during the course of the droplet deformation , and that the buckling morphology is determined by structural defects in the particle packing .",
    "we have seen that particle - laden droplets fail under suction in two steps : first , a capillary instability , where encapsulated fluid escapes the droplet , and second , an elastic instability , where the shell buckles . to reveal the underlying physics",
    ", we measure the onset of these two instabilities as a function of the droplet radius , @xmath9 , and pipette radius , @xmath4 .",
    "we vary @xmath9 from 10 - 100 @xmath2 m and @xmath4 from 3 - 12 @xmath2 m .",

    ", the marker size in the left panel scales with the droplet radius and the marker size in the right panel scales with the pipette radius .",
    "while the capillary instability always precedes buckling , @xmath14 , both instabilities occur at a similar magnitude of suction , @xmath15 .",
    "the magnitude of the critical pressures decreases strongly with the pipette radius ; however , they do not show strong dependence on the droplet size .    to understand how this size dependence reflects the mechanical properties of the interface ,",
    "let us first review the case of a bare droplet .",
    "the interface of a bare fluid droplet has a simple state of stress : its tension is independent of shape or deformation , @xmath16 .",
    "mechanical equilibrium of fluid interfaces is well - captured by the young- laplace equation , which states that @xmath17 , where @xmath0 is the surface stress and @xmath18 is the total interfacial curvature , @xmath19 for a sphere of radius @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , as the pressure in the pipette is reduced , the curvature of the tongue must increase .",
    "however , the curvature of the tongue is limited by the radius of the pipette .",
    "thus , at the limit of mechanical stability @xcite , @xmath21.\\ ] ]    or in terms of the tension , @xmath22    we measured the onset of the capillary instability for a range of bare hexadecane droplets in water .",
    "the critical pressure for these droplets shows a clear dependence on the droplet and pipette size ( figure [ fig4 ] , green ) .",
    "however , when we use equation [ tension ] and the droplet radius @xmath9 at the onset of capillary instability to calculate the tension , we find that it is independent of @xmath9 or @xmath4 and is @xmath23 mn / m ( figure [ fig5 ] , green ) .",
    "this is very close to the surface tension of hexadecane - water interface reported in the literature , @xmath24 mn / m @xcite .",
    "therefore , the marginal mechanical stability of a bare liquid interface is well described by equations [ laplace ] and [ tension ] with a constant tension .",
    "for comparison , we prepared hexadecane droplets stabilized in a solution of 1% ( by weight ) sds ( american bioanalytical abo1920 - 00100 ) , a common molecular surfactant .",
    "upon aspiration , these droplets respond similarly to bare droplets .",
    "they undergo a single catastrophic capillary instability without any visible buckling ( figure [ fig4 ] , magenta ) . like the bare droplet case",
    ", we find that the mechanical stability of the droplets is determined by equations [ laplace ] and [ tension ] with a size - independent tension @xmath25 mn / m ( figure [ fig5 ] , magenta ) .",
    "the tension here is much lower than the bare interface case , and is consistent with literature values of the water / sds / hexadecane surface tension @xcite .",
    "so although sds stabilizes the interface , it makes the droplets mechanically weaker and hence , easier to deform .",
    "given its success in describing the bare and sds - laden droplets , we apply equation [ tension ] to calculate the critical tension for the capillary instability of the particle - laden droplets and plot these results in figure [ fig5 ] ; blue . while the largest droplets appear to have a tension similar to the bare droplets , the apparent tension of the smaller droplets is more variable , and greater than or equal to the tension of the bare droplets .",
    "this size dependence and the scatter suggests that equation [ laplace ] is not appropriate to describe the marginal equilibrium of particle - stabilized droplets , and that the tension values that equation [ tension ] returns are incorrect .",
    "why do equations [ laplace ] and [ tension ] succeed for bare and sds - laden droplets while failing for particle - laden droplets ?",
    "the essential difference lies in the rheology of the interface .",
    "while the bare and sds - laden interfaces are fluid @xcite , the particle - laden interface is solid .",
    "this is a generic feature of particle - laden interfaces at sufficiently high density @xcite @xcite and is made apparent in this system by the lack of particle rearrangements at the interface , as described above . for a solid interface ,",
    "the tension is no longer uniform across the interface , and the state of stress is more complex than assumed in the arguments leading up to equation [ laplace ] .",
    "we make progress by noting that while aspiration compresses the interface outside the pipette , it dilates the interface inside the pipette .",
    "the interface of the tongue should therefore have liquid - like rheology with a tension nearly equal to that of the bare interface .",
    "hence , we can determine the pressure inside the droplet at the point of instability using the young - laplace equation , @xmath26 .",
    "the size dependence of the pressure inside the droplet at the onset of capillary instability , @xmath27 , is plotted in figure [ fig6 ] ( top ) . for bare droplets , shown in green ,",
    "this pressure increases as the droplet becomes smaller , as predicted by the young - laplace equation .",
    "however , the pressure inside the particle - laden droplets at the point of capillary instability shows no apparent size dependence and is near zero .",
    "the results are very similar if we consider the pressure inside the droplet at the point of buckling , @xmath28 , as shown in figure [ fig6 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "again , we see very little dependence of the pressure on the droplet size , and the values clustered around zero .",
    "the buckling of the particle - laden droplets at zero pressure is consistent with classic observations of surface instabilities of compressed monolayers @xcite .",
    "there , it is found that the surface goes unstable when the net tension on the interface approaches zero .",
    "the young - laplace equation demands that the pressure drop across an interface goes to zero as its tension goes to zero . by that argument",
    ", the surface of particle - laden droplets should become unstable when the pressure drop across the interface vanishes .",
    "this is consistent with the observed onset of buckling shown in figure [ fig6 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "generally , the vanishing of the tension is insufficient to drive the surface instability since a surface can also have some bending rigidity .",
    "the finite rigidity case is captured by the classic linear theory of thin shells @xcite@xcite . here",
    ", a thin homogeneous linear elastic shell becomes unstable when @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the shell thickness and @xmath31 is a modified young s modulus , @xmath32{3 ( 1- \\nu^2 ) } } $ ] . while the particle shells are inhomogeneous , we use equation [ bucp ] to put an upper bound on the apparent value of @xmath33 .",
    "we find @xmath33 to be @xmath34   kpa@xmath35m@xmath36 based on the fit shown by the red curve in figure [ fig6 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the mechanics of particle - stabilized droplets was found to be qualitatively different than the mechanics of bare or sds - stabilized droplets .",
    "particle - stabilized droplets undergo a two - step failure under suction .",
    "first , a capillary instability , where fluid is withdrawn from the shell with minimal change to the droplet shape .",
    "second , an elastic instability , where the shell buckles .",
    "both instabilities occur as the interfacial tension vanishes .",
    "the gap in suction pressure between the two instabilities may arise from a finite , but small , bending rigidity of the particle - laden interface .",
