    "for @xmath1-metal compounds with localized magnetic moments , basic guidelines to soothsay the sign of the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) magnetic exchange interactions , i.  e. , the anderson - goodenough - kanamori rules  @xcite , were laid down back in the 1950 s . with one single bridging anion and half - filled @xmath1 states",
    "these rules safely predict antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange interactions , as is indeed encountered in numerous magnetic mott insulators .",
    "it is however much harder to anticipate the sign of the couplings for geometries with two bridging ligands and bond angles close to @xmath6 .",
    "illustrative recent examples are the @xmath7 honeycomb systems na@xmath3iro@xmath4 and li@xmath3iro@xmath4 .",
    "the signs of the nn heisenberg @xmath8 and of the additional symmetric kitaev anisotropy @xmath9 are intensely debated in these iridates , with both @xmath10 , @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xcite sets of parameters being used to explain the available experimental data .",
    "the sizable kitaev interactions , that is , uniaxial symmetric terms @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) that cyclically permute on the bonds of a particular hexagonal ring @xcite , are associated to strong frustration effects and unconventional magnetic ground states displaying , for example , noncollinear order , incommensurability , or spin - liquid behavior @xcite . obviously , in the context of electronic - structure computational methods , such features can not be thoroughly addressed by periodic total - energy calculations for a given set of predetermined spin configurations .",
    "a much more effective strategy is to first focus on individual pairs of nn @xmath1-metal sites and obtain reliable values for the associated effective magnetic couplings by using _",
    "ab initio _ many - body quantum chemistry ( qc ) machinery ( for a recent review , see ref .  ) .",
    "the computed exchange parameters can be subsequently fed to effective spin hamiltonians to be solved for larger sets of magnetically active lattice sites .",
    "such an approach , earlier , allowed us to establish the signs plus the relative strengths of the heisenberg and kitaev interactions in both na@xmath3iro@xmath4 and li@xmath3iro@xmath4 and to additionally rationalize the qualitatively different types of af orders in these two @xmath2 honeycomb iridates @xcite .",
    "the related @xmath5 honeycomb compound li@xmath3rho@xmath4 is even more puzzling because it features no sign of long - range magnetic order .",
    "instead , an experimental study suggests the presence of a spin - glass ground state @xcite . while the spin - orbit couplings ( soc s ) are still sizable for the @xmath16 shell and may in principle give rise on the honeycomb lattice to compelling kitaev physics , to date no conclusive evidence is in this respect available for li@xmath3rho@xmath4 . to shed light on the nature of the essential exchange interactions in li@xmath3rho@xmath4 we here carry out detailed _ ab initio _ qc calculations .",
    "we show that large trigonal splittings within the rh @xmath17 shell , comparable with the strength of the soc , dismiss a simple picture based on @xmath18 and @xmath19 effective states @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of the system can still be described , however , in terms of @xmath20 pseudospins .",
    "the calculations earmark li@xmath3rho@xmath4 as a 4@xmath1-electron system with remarkably large anisotropic magnetic couplings , in particular , fm kitaev interactions of up to 1015 mev .",
    "the isotropic heisenberg exchange , on the other hand , features opposite signs on the two sets of structurally distinct links of rh nn s .",
    "this sign modulation of the nn heisenberg interactions , with strong ferromagnetic ( fm ) @xmath8 s for one type of rh - rh bonds and weaker af couplings for the other pairs of adjacent rh sites , enables the initial @xmath20 hexagonal network to be mapped onto an effective model of spin-1 dimers on a frustrated triangular lattice .",
    "we further address the issue of rh - li anti - site disorder in samples of li@xmath3rho@xmath4 . by exact - diagonalization ( ed ) calculations for an extended spin model that also includes second and third neighbor couplings , we show that the experimentally observed spin - glass behavior can be rationalized as a superposition of different nearly - degenerate symmetry - broken states arising at finite concentration of in - plane spin vacancies .",
    "the tetravalent rhodium ions in li@xmath3rho@xmath4 display a 4@xmath22 valence electron configuration , octahedral ligand coordination and bonding through two bridging ligands . in the simplest picture , i.e. , for sufficiently large rh @xmath17@xmath23 splittings and degenerate @xmath17 levels , the ground - state electron configuration at each site is a @xmath0 effective @xmath18 spin - orbit doublet @xcite . for @xmath2 ions in a variety of three - dimensional , layered , and chain - like oxides , _ ab initio _ qc electronic - structure calculations yield excitation energies of 0.60.9 ev for the transitions between the @xmath24 and split @xmath25 levels @xcite and indicate values of 0.450.5 ev for the strength of the soc @xmath26 , in agreement with earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "sharp features in the range of 0.60.9 ev are indeed found in the resonant x - ray scattering spectra @xcite .",
    "the validity of the @xmath18 approximation for the ground state of li@xmath3rho@xmath4 is however questionable since the soc is substantially weaker for @xmath16 elements .",
    "indeed our qc calculations ( see table  [ rh213_dd ] ) indicate rh @xmath17 splittings @xmath27 ev , close to values of 0.140.16 ev estimated for @xmath26 in various rh@xmath21 oxides @xcite . for the _ ab initio _ qc investigation we employed multiconfiguration complete - active - space self - consistent - field ( casscf ) and multireference configuration - interaction ( mrci ) calculations",
    "@xcite , see supplemental material ( sm ) and refs .  .",
    "with @xmath28 and @xmath26 parameters of similar size , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 states are strongly admixed , as discussed in earlier work @xcite and illustrated in table  [ rh213_dd ] . in particular , for the relativistic ground - state wave function",
    "the @xmath17 hole is not equally distributed among the three rh @xmath17 levels as for the `` true '' @xmath18 ground state @xcite but displays predominant @xmath29 character , close to 60% .",
    "interestingly , while the results for the on - site @xmath5 excitations are quite different as compared to the @xmath2 excitation energies @xcite , the computed intersite effective interactions are qualitatively similar to those obtained for the @xmath2 honeycomb iridate li@xmath3iro@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the intersite exchange couplings were estimated by mrci+soc calculations for embedded fragments having two edge - sharing iro@xmath30 octahedra in the active region .",
    "as described in earlier work @xcite and in sm , the _ ab initio _ qc data for the lowest four spin - orbit states describing the magnetic spectrum of two nn octahedra is mapped in our scheme onto an effective spin hamiltonian including both isotropic heisenberg exchange and symmetric anisotropy . yet",
    "the spin - orbit calculations , casscf or mrci , incorporate all nine triplet and nine singlet states that arise from the two - site @xmath0@xmath0 configuration . for on - site kramers - doublet configurations , the most general symmetry - allowed form of the effective spin hamiltonian , for a pair of nn ions , is @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 are 1/2 pseudospin operators , @xmath8 is the isotropic heisenberg interaction , @xmath9 the kitaev coupling , and the @xmath34 coeeficients are offdiagonal elements of the symmetric anisotropic exchange matrix with @xmath35 .",
    "the antisymmetric anisotropic term vanishes since the crystallographic data reported in ref .   indicate overall @xmath36 point - group symmetry for one block of nn rho@xmath30 ocathedra , green ( b1 ) bonds in fig.[213_structure ] , and only slight deviations from @xmath36 for the other type of nn s , blue ( b2 and b3 ) bonds in fig.[213_structure ] . for @xmath36 symmetry of the rh - rh link , @xmath37 .",
    "we note that in ( [ eqn : eqn1 ] ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 stand for components in the _ local _ , kitaev bond reference frame .",
    "the @xmath40 axis is here perpendicular to the rh@xmath3o@xmath3 plaquette ( see si and refs .  ) .",
    "relative energies for the four low - lying states describing the magnetic spectrum of two nn octahedra and the resulting effective coupling constants are listed in table  [ rh213_mgn_coupl ] . for the effective picture of @xmath41 pseudospins assumed in eq.([eqn : eqn1 ] ) , the set of four eigenfunctions contains the singlet @xmath42 and the triplet components @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . in @xmath36 symmetry , the  full \" spin - orbit wave functions associated to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 transform according to the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 irreducible representations , respectively . since two of the triplet terms",
    "may interact , the most compact way to express the eigenstates of ( [ eqn : eqn1 ] ) is then @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the angle @xmath38 parametrizes the amount of @xmath47@xmath48 mixing , related to finite off - diagonal @xmath57 couplings .",
    "this degree of admixture is determined by analysis of the full qc spin - orbit wave functions .",
    "the effective parameters provided in table[rh213_mgn_coupl ] are obtained for each type of rh - rh link by using the @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 mrci relative energies and the @xmath47@xmath48 mixing coefficients ( see sm ) .    for b1 links , we find that both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are fm . while by mrci calculations @xmath9 always comes fm in spin - orbit coupled honeycomb systems @xcite , the fm @xmath8 for the b1 bonds has much to do with the peculiar kind of dependence on the amount of trigonal squashing of the oxygen octahedra and consequently on the variation of the rh - o - rh angles of the rh@xmath3o@xmath3 plaquette",
    ". the latter increase to values larger than 90@xmath62 for finite trigonal compression .",
    "this dependence of the nn @xmath8 on the rh - o - rh bond angles is illustrated in fig.2 for a simplified structural model of li@xmath3rho@xmath4 where the rh - o bond lengths are all the same , set to the average bond length in the experimental crystal structure @xcite .",
    "it is seen that @xmath8 displays a parabolic behavior , with a minimum of about 5 mev in the interval 9293@xmath62 and a change of sign to af couplings around 96@xmath62 . for the b1 rh - rh links ,",
    "the rh - o - rh bond angle is 93.4@xmath62 , close to the value that defines the minimum in fig.2 .",
    "the difference between the @xmath635 mev minimum of fig.2 and the @xmath6310 mev result listed in table[rh213_mgn_coupl ] comes from additional distortions of the o octahedra in the actual structure ( see the footnotes in table[rh213_mgn_coupl ] and ref . ) , not included in the idealized model considered for the plot in fig.2 .",
    "an even stronger fm @xmath8 was computed for the b1 type bonds in the related compound li@xmath3iro@xmath4 @xcite . in na@xmath3iro@xmath4 ,",
    "on the other hand , the ir - o - ir bond angles are @xmath6497@xmath62 and the nn @xmath8 turns af on all short ir - ir links @xcite .    for the b2 and b3 links ,",
    "we derive a fm kitaev term and an af heisenberg interaction , again qualitatively similar to the qc data for li@xmath3iro@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we assign the af value of the nn @xmath8 on the b2/b3 units to the slightly larger rh - o - rh bond angle , which as shown in fig.2 pulls the @xmath8 towards a positive value , and most importantly to additional distortions that shift the bridging ligands on the rh - o@xmath3-rh b2/b3 plaquettes in opposite senses parallel to the rh - rh axis @xcite .",
    "the role of these additional distortions on the b2/b3 units was analyzed in detail in ref . and shown to enhance as well the af component to the intersite exchange .",
    "for further insights into the magnetic properties of li@xmath3rho@xmath4 , we carried out ed calculations for an extended spin hamiltonian that in addition to the nn terms of eq.(1 ) incorporates longer - range second- and third - neighbor heisenberg interactions @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we used clusters of 24 sites with periodic boundary conditions @xcite and the quantum chemically derived nn coupling constants listed in table[rh213_mgn_coupl ] .",
    "the static spin - structure factor @xmath67 $ ] was calculated as function of variable @xmath65 and @xmath66 parameters . for a given set of @xmath65 and @xmath66 values ,",
    "the dominant order is determined according to the wave number * q * = @xmath68 providing a maximum value of @xmath69 .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig.3(a ) . given the similar structure of the nn magnetic interactions , it is somewhat similar to that obtained in our previous study on li@xmath3iro@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "six different regions can be identified for @xmath70 mev : fm , nel , kitaev spin liquid , stripy , diagonal zigzag and incommensurate @xmath71 ( icx ) phases . the kitaev spin liquid",
    ", stripy and incommensurate phases in strongly spin - orbit coupled honeycomb @xmath2 systems were analyzed in a number of earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the detailed nature of the diagonal zigzag and incommensurate icx ground states for large fm @xmath8 on one set of nn links was described in ref .. remarkably , for @xmath72 much larger than @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the initial hexagonal @xmath75 lattice can be mapped onto an effective triangular model of _ triplet _ dimers on the b1 bonds @xcite .",
    "since @xmath65 and @xmath66 are expected to be af in honeycomb @xmath22 oxides @xcite , the most likely candidate for the magnetic ground state of `` clean '' crystals of li@xmath3rho@xmath4 , according to our results , is the diagonal zigzag state ( see fig.3 ) and is found to be stable in a wide region of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "experimentally , however , a spin - glass ground state was determined , with a spin freezing temperature of @xmath78k @xcite . as possible cause of the observed spin - glass behavior in li@xmath3rho@xmath4 we here investigate the role of li - rh site intercalation .",
    "significant disorder on the cation sublattice is a well known feature in li@xmath3_m_o@xmath4 compounds .",
    "a typical value for the degree of li@xmath79_m_@xmath21 site inversion in these materials is 1015@xmath80 @xcite .",
    "partial substitution of the `` in - plane '' rh@xmath21 ions by nonmagnetic li@xmath79 species introduces spin deffects in the @xmath75 honeycomb layer . on the 24-site cluster employed for our ed calculations",
    ", 1015@xmath80 site inversion translates in replacing two @xmath75 centers by vacancies .",
    "hereafter , we denote the two spin defects as @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    the effect of spin vacancies on the static spin - structure factor in the diagonal zigzag phase ( @xmath83 ) is shown in fig.3(d),(e ) .",
    "for comparison , the static spin - structure factor is also plotted in fig.3(c ) for the ideal case without spin defects . in the absence of `` defects ''",
    ", the ground state is characterized in the bulk limit by symmetry - broken long - range order with either @xmath84 or @xmath85 wave vectors .",
    "since the two symmetry - breaking states are degenerate , the structure factor displays four peaks , at @xmath86 and @xmath87 [ see fig.3(c ) ] .",
    "however , by introducing spin vacancies , the degeneracy may be lifted via impurity pinning effects .",
    "for example , when the two defects occupy positions 17 and 20 [ @xmath88 , see fig.3(b ) ] the spin structure defines one of the symmetry - breaking states with @xmath86 [ fig.3(d ) ] ; likewise , defects at @xmath89 yield a state with @xmath87 [ fig.3(e ) ] . in other words , two different kinds of dominant short - range order can be obtained with anti - site disorder .",
    "the `` locally '' favored symmetry - breaking direction depends on the relative positions of the spin vacancies . in a macroscopic system ,",
    "such `` local '' domains displaying different symmetry - breaking ordering directions are randomly distributed . additional _",
    "frustration _ is expected to arise because it is not possible to match two differently ordered domains without an emerging `` string '' .",
    "it is therefore likely that by creating some amount of spin defects the long - range zigzag order disappears and the resulting state is perceived as a spin glass at low temperature .",
    "a similar mechanism was proposed for the isotropic heisenberg - kitaev and @xmath90-@xmath65-@xmath66 models @xcite .",
    "an early well known example of frustration induced through the competition between two different , degenerate spin configurations is the two - dimensional ising model on a square lattice with randomly distributed , competing fm and af bonds  @xcite . to investigate how the diagonal zigzag state is destroyed by increasing the concentration of spin defects",
    ", we also studied a simplified ising model with @xmath91 for the b1 bonds , @xmath92 and all other interactions set to zero .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for the honeycomb layers of li@xmath3rho@xmath4 since the diagonal zigzag phase essentially consists of alternating spin - up and spin - down chains [ see sketch in fig.3(a ) ] .",
    "spin structures obtained this way for various spin - defect concentrations @xmath93 are shown in fig.3(f)-(i ) .",
    "for @xmath94 the symmetry - breaking diagonal zigzag state is realized , with degenerate @xmath86 and @xmath87 spin structures . at finite , low concentration @xmath95 those two configurations",
    "are no longer degenerate since one of them features slightly lower ground - state energy .",
    "we still have in this case a `` macroscopically stable '' ground state . at intermediate defect concentration",
    "@xmath96 the long - range order is in a strict sense destroyed .",
    "however , the large domain walls with either @xmath86 or @xmath87 seem to survive . at higher concentration @xmath97",
    "the long - range order disappears completely .",
    "moreover , we can now identify a mixture of local structures with different symmetry - breaking directions [ see fig.3(i ) ] .",
    "in sum , we have calculated the microscopic neareast - neighbor magnetic interactions between effective 1/2 spins in li@xmath3rho@xmath4 and uncovered a substantial difference between the two types of bonds that are present : one is dominated by heisenberg and the other by kitaev types of couplings .",
    "the latter give rise to strong frustration , even if the interactions are predominantly ferromagnetic . in this",
    "setting we have additionally considered the effect of the presence of anti - site disorder . experimentally the in - plane spin - defect concentration in li@xmath3rho@xmath4 has been estimated as @xmath981015@xmath80 @xcite . based on our theoretical findings",
    "it is likely that the observed spin - glass behavior arises from the combination of such anti - site disorder and strongly frustrating magnetic interactions , in particular , the different kitaev / heisenberg dominated magnetic bonds and the ising - like physics associated with the triplet dimer formation that results from there .    our combined _ ab initio _ and effective - model calculations on both li@xmath3rho@xmath4 and related @xmath22 honeycomb iridates @xcite indicate that a description in terms of on - site 1/2 pseudospins can well account for the diverse magnetic properties of these systems . while alternative models rely on the formation of delocalized , quasimolecular orbitals @xcite and for li@xmath3rho@xmath4 downplay the role of spin - orbit interactions @xcite , here we show that the latter give rise in li@xmath3rho@xmath4 to anisotropic kitaev interactions the same magnitude as in @xmath7 iridates @xcite .",
    "that happens in spite of having a rh @xmath17 splitting @xmath28 and a spin - orbit coupling @xmath26 of similar magnitude , the same way similar sets of ir @xmath28 and @xmath26 parameters in cairo@xmath4 @xcite still generate symmetric anisotropic exchange terms in the range of 10 mev ( work is in progress ) .",
    "the molpro qc package was employed for all _ ab initio _ calculations  @xcite . to analyze the electronic ground state and the nature of the @xmath1-@xmath1 excitations , a cluster consisting of one reference rho@xmath30 octahedron plus three nn rho@xmath30 octahedra and 15 nearby li ions was used .",
    "the magnetic spectrum for two rh@xmath21 ions was obtained from calculations on a cluster containing two reference and four nn rho@xmath30 octahedra plus the surrounding 22 li ions , see si for details .",
    "the farther solid - state environment was in both cases modeled as a finite array of point charges fitted to reproduce the crystal madelung field in the cluster region .",
    "the spin - orbit treatment was carried out according to the procedure described in ref .  , using spin - orbit pseudopotentials for ir .",
