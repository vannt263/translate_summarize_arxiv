    "<S> purcell s scallop theorem defines the type of motions of a solid body - reciprocal motions - which can not propel the body in a viscous fluid with zero reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the flapping of a wing is reciprocal and , as was recently shown , can lead to directed motion only if its frequency reynolds number , @xmath0 , is above a critical value of order one . using elementary examples </S>",
    "<S> , we show the existence of oscillatory reciprocal motions which are effective for all arbitrarily small values of the frequency reynolds number and induce net velocities scaling as @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates a continuous breakdown of the scallop theorem with inertia .    </S>",
    "<S> a large variety of biological movements occur in a fluid environment , from swimming bacteria to whales . in many cases , </S>",
    "<S> the study of fluid forces is crucial to the understanding of animal locomotion @xcite . because of the large range of relevant length scales in biological motility - eight orders of magnitude in size , from less than a hundred nanometers to tens of meters - fluid mechanics occurs in distinct regimes with important mechanical consequences . on small length scales , </S>",
    "<S> the relevant reynolds number is usually very small ( @xmath3 for swimming _ e. coli _ ) and viscous forces are dominant . </S>",
    "<S> this is the stokesian realm of swimming microorganisms such as bacteria , spermatozoa , and ciliated cells . at the opposite end of the range of length scales , </S>",
    "<S> the reynolds numbers are typically very large ( @xmath4 for a swimming tuna ) and inertial forces are dominant . </S>",
    "<S> this is the eulerian realm of flying birds and swimming fishes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we address the transition from the stokesian to the eulerian realm , and show that , in some situations , this transition can take place continuously with an increase of the relevant reynolds number .    in his 1977 lecture _ life at low reynolds numbers _ </S>",
    "<S> , edward purcell introduced the  scallop theorem \" @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he observed that the stokes equations , which govern fluid flows at zero reynolds numbers and are both linear and independent of time , are identical under time reversal . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , there exists a certain geometrical class of motion ( or , more generally , actuation of a solid body ) , termed `` reciprocal motion '' , which can not lead to any locomotion in this limit . a reciprocal motion ( or actuation ) is a motion in which the geometrical paths followed by various material points on the body are identical when viewed under time reversal . by symmetry , such motion can only lead to a net movement equal to minus itself , and therefore , no net movement at all ( see also refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest example of a reciprocal motion is a periodic motion composed of two distinct parts . in the first part </S>",
    "<S> , the body moves in a certain prescribed way , and in the second part , the body moves in a manner which is identical to the first - part as seen under time reversal . </S>",
    "<S> a scallop opening and closing belongs to this subclass of reciprocal motion and , independently of the rate of opening and closing , the scallop can not move .    </S>",
    "<S> another example of reciprocal motion - or , in this case , reciprocal actuation - is a flapping body . </S>",
    "<S> consider a solid body oscillated up and down in translation in a prescribed manner by an external means . </S>",
    "<S> since the motion going up is the time - reversal symmetry of the motion going down , the flapping body does not move on average in the limit of zero reynolds numbers . however , large animals such as birds use flapping wings for locomotion , and so clearly a thin flapping body must be effective in the eulerian realm . </S>",
    "<S> the question then arises : when does a flapping body - or more generally a reciprocal motion - become effective ? </S>",
    "<S> how much inertial force is necessary to break the constraints of the scallop theorem ?    </S>",
    "<S> this question was first formulated and studied by childress and dudley @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mollusc _ </S>",
    "<S> clione antarctica _ was observed to possess two modes of locomotion . </S>",
    "<S> the first is non - reciprocal and uses cilia distributed along the body of the mollusc . </S>",
    "<S> the second is reciprocal and consists of two flapping wings . </S>",
    "<S> the flapping - wing mode was observed to be predominant for the large swimming velocities . using both experimental observations and fluid mechanics models </S>",
    "<S> , the authors postulated that reciprocal motions are ineffective in producing any net motion unless the relevant frequency - or `` flapping '' - reynolds number , @xmath0 , is sufficiently large ( order unity ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the transition from no - motion to motion occurs at a finite value of @xmath0 and the breakdown of the scallop theorem is discontinuous . </S>",
    "<S> this idea was subsequently studied in laboratory experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite of flapping symmetric bodies , both of which confirmed the transition to directed motion as a symmetry - breaking instability occurring at a finite value of the frequency reynolds number , as well as the robustness of this transition to a change in a variety of geometrical and mechanical parameters .    in this paper , we consider a series of elementary oscillatory reciprocal motions of a solid body with broken spatial symmetries and show that they become effective in producing a net translation of the body for arbitrarily small values of the frequency reynolds number , with induced velocities scaling as @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , _ inertial creep _ @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates a continuous breakdown of the scallop theorem with inertia .    </S>",
    "<S> the examples we propose rely on classical results of lift forces for the motion of spherical particles at small reynolds number @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a solid spherical particle ( density @xmath5 , radius @xmath6 ) oscillating with frequency @xmath7 and amplitude @xmath8 in a fluid of density @xmath9 and shear viscosity @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the three different setups we propose are described below , and we start by some general remarks . in the case of purely translational motion , including the effect of inertia on the particle motion can be done in a number of limits , as there are in general three relevant reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the unsteady term in the navier - stokes equations scales as @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the typical speed of translation ) , and is smaller than the typical viscous term , of order @xmath13 , by a factor of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the kinematic viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the nonlinear advective term in the navier - stokes equations scales with @xmath16 , and is smaller than the viscous term by a factor of @xmath17 , which is the flapping ( or `` frequency '' ) reynolds number @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , the particle inertia is quantified by a particle reynolds number , @xmath18 , the ratio of the typical rate of change of the particle momentum , @xmath19 , to the typical viscous forces on the particle , @xmath20 . in this paper , we will consider the asymptotic limit where @xmath21 so that the motion of the flapper is quasi - static and the leading - order departure of the fluid forces from the stokes laws is due to the nonlinear advective term in the navier - stokes equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the limit described by eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is equivalent to that of small frequency reynolds number ( @xmath22 ) and large flapping amplitude ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is a different limit from the work in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where body inertia likely played an important role . </S>",
    "<S> we consider below three examples of such large - amplitude low-@xmath0 reciprocal flapping which lead to directed motion for arbitrarily small values of @xmath25 .    ) for arbitrarily small values of the frequency reynolds number . in each example , the reciprocal motion is composed of the periodic repetition of two distinct parts , with the second part ( bottom ) being identical to the first part ( top ) as seen under time reversal : ( a ) oscillation in vertical position of a sphere parallel to a solid surface leads to motion perpendicular to the surface ; ( b ) in - phase oscillations in translation and rotation of a sphere leads to motion perpendicular to both the directions of translation and rotation ; ( c ) oscillation in vertical position of a sphere in an oscillating shear flow ( in phase ) leads to motion perpendicular to the direction of translation ; in all cases , @xmath26 denotes the ( small ) sphere velocity induced by inertial forces . in case ( a ) , the distance to the solid surface is denoted @xmath27 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the first example is that of a flapper near a wall . specifically , we consider the reciprocal oscillation in vertical position of the solid sphere with velocity @xmath28 parallel to a stationary solid surface and free to move in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions ( see notations in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mainfig]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the stokes flow limit ( @xmath31 ) , the sphere experiences no lift force , and remains at a constant distance , @xmath27 , to the solid surface . </S>",
    "<S> the first effect of inertia on this problem , in the limit set by eq .  , is the appearance of a lift force , directed away from the solid surface , and independent of the sign of @xmath32 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a limit is captured when the oseen length scale @xmath33 , the distance away from the sphere where inertial forces become important , is much larger than all relevant length scales of the problem , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the sphere radius , @xmath6 , and its distance to the surface , @xmath27 . in the simple case where @xmath34 , the lift force leads to a low - reynolds number lift velocity for </S>",
    "<S> the particle @xcite @xmath35 always directed away from the surface . for an oscillatory motion , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 , the lift velocity away from the surface averages over one period to @xmath37 a flapper near a wall performing a reciprocal translational motion is therefore able to move forward ( away from the wall ) for arbitrarily small values of the frequency reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> this inertial migration decreases to zero with the first power of the reynolds number ( @xmath38 ) , and the stokes limit is recovered when we formally set @xmath31 in eq .  .    </S>",
    "<S> our second example is that of a rotating flapper . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case where the solid sphere is oscillating both in translation and rotation , with velocity and rotation rates given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and is free to move in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 direction ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mainfig]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the two oscillations are in phase , the actuation of the sphere is reciprocal , which we will assume here , and no average motion is obtained in the stokes limit . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath41 is the typical magnitude of @xmath42 , the rotation reynolds number @xmath43 measures the importance of inertial forces due to the rotational motion . in the asymptotic limit set by eq .  , and for @xmath44 , the first effect of inertia is the appearance of a lift force perpendicular to both the directions of translation and rotation @xcite and given by @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a low - reynolds number lift velocity @xmath46 when @xmath47 , we obtain an average translational velocity , along the @xmath29 direction , given by @xmath48 here again , the reciprocal translational and rotational motion of the solid sphere leads to a directed motion for arbitrarily small values of the reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of this directed motion also decreases to zero with the first power of @xmath0 ( @xmath49 ) .    as a final example , we show that these results are also valid when the fluid in the far - field is not quiescent by considering a flapper in a shear flow . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mainfig]c , we consider the case when the solid sphere is oscillating in vertical position with a prescribed velocity , @xmath50 , in a shear flow described by the far - field undisturbed flow field @xmath51 ( the center of the sphere is located at @xmath52 ) and is free to move in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions . </S>",
    "<S> if the two oscillations are in phase , the motion of the sphere is reciprocal , which we assume here , and no average motion is obtained in the limit of zero reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that the sphere is far away from the surfaces responsible for the creation of the shear flow and therefore ignore wall effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath53 denotes the typical magnitude of @xmath54 , an additional reynolds number , @xmath55 , needs to be introduced . here , the first effect of inertia is the appearance of a lift force directed across the undisturbed streamlines @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the original study , due to saffman @xcite , calculated this lift force in the limit where @xmath56 , and in this case the lift force is moving the sphere in the direction opposite to its translational velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we consider here the same asymptotic limit , together with the limit assumed in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , and if @xmath57 , the sphere experiences a low - reynolds number lift velocity given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a numerical coefficient . for an oscillatory motion @xmath60 , and with @xmath61 to satisfy saffman s asymptotic limit , we get an average velocity , along the @xmath29 direction , given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 . as in the previous cases , the actuation of the sphere is reciprocal and yet it leads to a directed motion for arbitrarily small values of the frequency reynolds number @xmath0 . here , however , the magnitude of the induced velocity decreases to zero with the square - root of the reynolds number ( @xmath64 ) . also , in this case , the motion will continue until the point along the @xmath29 axis where the local velocity from the shear flow cancels out the translational velocity of the sphere .    as a summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented elementary examples of oscillatory reciprocal forcing of a solid body leading to net translational motion of the body for arbitrarily small values of the frequency reynolds number , @xmath0 . when the frequency reynolds number is formally set to zero </S>",
    "<S> , the effect disappears as dictated by the scallop theorem , but it remains non - zero for all non - zero values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the induced average velocities scale as @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , corresponding to the limit of asymptotically large strouhal number , @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the breakdown of purcell s scallop theorem with inertia can take place in a continuous way without a finite onset of translational motion .    as our examples show , a directed motion on the order of the flapping velocity will take place when @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the mechanical efficiencies of the examples above - ratio of the useful work to the total work done by the flapper - scale as @xmath67 so that order one efficiencies should also be expected for order one reynolds numbers . from a biological perspective , both these observations suggest that reciprocal gaits are very inefficient for small reynolds number and become advantageous only when @xmath66 . consequently , and even in the absence of a mathematical bifurcation , the onset of an appropriately defined `` efficient flapping flight '' is expected occur at a finite value of @xmath0 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is important to note that all of our examples display some spatial broken symmetries which govern the direction of the net motion of the solid body : ( a ) the location of the wall , ( b ) the direction of the rotation rate , and ( c ) the direction of the shear flow . </S>",
    "<S> this is somewhat different from the `` flapping wing '' setup studied experimentally in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and numerically in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where both the shape and the actuation of the wing are symmetric and where locomotion is a result of a hydrodynamic instability @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have considered examples leading to net translational motion , but similar examples exploiting lift forces and torques on asymmetric particles @xcite could be devised leading to a net rotation , or combined translation and rotation , of the solid body @xcite . </S>"
