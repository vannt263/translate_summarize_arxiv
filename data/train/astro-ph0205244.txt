    "c99 suggest that the changes in the optical light curve are due to the variability in the emission measure of an optically thin circumstellar envelope emitting via free - free and bound - free emission mechanisms . as there was no evidence for optical modulation at the orbital period ,",
    "c99 concluded that it is unlikely that the periastron passage of the neutron star effects the mass - loss rate from the optical companion .",
    "we note however that hutchings ( 1984 ) found that the h@xmath4 emission from a0535 + 26 was modulated on the 111  d period .",
    "we find little evidence for any periodicities in the light curves of  and .",
    "the orbital periods of be / xrts are usually determined from the recurrence period of outbursts , particularly in x - rays .",
    "we found a stable period of 421  d for a053866 ( see alcock et al.2001 ) which we suggest is related to the formation and depletion of the equatorial disc around the be star , and is certainly _ not _ orbital in origin .",
    "however , the long - term modulations we observe in the optical light curves of  and  are most likely due to non - periodic variations characteristic of be stars .",
    "if stable long - term variations are present in the light curves of  and , they are occurring on much longer timescales than presented here .    if it is assumed that the orbital plane of the neutron star and the equatorial plane of the be star are coincident , then when the neutron star passes through the dense material close to the be star at periastron , an x - ray flare should be observed .",
    "c99 tested this model using their simultaneous optical and x - ray data of a0535 + 26 .",
    "if the neutron star is accreting directly from the outflowing circumstellar disc material , the optical and x - ray light curves should be strongly correlated .",
    "c99 did not find any positive correlation between the optical and x - ray data , and concluded that this indicates that the neutron star is not accreting directly from the stellar wind .",
    "c99 found that the x - ray outbursts seemed to occur after a period in which the optical light curve was seen to fade .",
    "this anti - correlation could represent a discrete episode of disc - loss which occurs radially , the interaction of the neutron star with this material then triggers the x - ray emission .",
    "they also observed a case in which an optical outburst was observed with no accompaning x - ray outburst .",

    "1995 , burderi et al.1998 ) .",
    "the lack of a strong correlation between the optical and x - ray data could be related to the low optical to x - ray luminosities observed for the sources .",
    "janot - pacheco et al .  ( 1987 ) showed that changes in the emission from the circumstellar disc lead to a correlation between _ v _ and _ ( b  v ) _ for a0535 + 26 .",
    "c99 confirmed that a correlation exists where the system becomes redder as it brightens , owing to a greater contribution from the cooler disc .",

    "however , another lmc be / xrt we have studied , , becomes redder as it fades ( see alcock et al .",
    "2001 ) . as the _ v_/_(b ",
    "v ) _ correlation is dependent on the inclination of the system , this suggests that we are viewing a0535 + 26 ,  and  at lower inclinations than  ( see mcgowan & charles 2002 ) .",

    "( 1998 ) investigated the long - term variability of optical spectroscopy of a0535 + 26 .",
    "the profile and equivalent width of the h@xmath0 emission line were found to vary considerably over the 7 year period of study .",
    "it varied between a single - peaked and double - peaked or asymmetric structure , and the relative intensities of the symmetric and asymmetric profiles varied over time .",
    "the asymmetries were characterised by an additional feature in the blue or red shoulder , which was sometimes displaced far enough from the rest wavelength to appear as a separate peak .",
    "clark et al .  ( 1998 ) conclude that the variability in the h@xmath0 line reflects the changes occurring in the circumstellar envelope , and suggest that the asymmetries observed in the profile are due to the envelope being asymmetric in geometry or density .",
    "we can confirm the optical identification of  with the northern component of the close double from the variability in the light curve , and the h@xmath0 emission that is observed in the spectra .",
    "the variability in the emission may be due to changes occurring in the circumstellar envelope as for a0535 + 26 ( clark et al .",

    "the colour changes for a0535 + 26 ,  and  are consistent with the systems becoming redder as they brighten owing to the greater contribution from the cooler equatorial disc ( janot - pacheco et al.1987 ) .",

    "<S> long - term variations are well - known in be x - ray binaries , and are attributed to non - orbital changes in the structure of the be circumstellar ( equatorial ) disc . however , the timescales involved are so long ( tens of days , to years ) that systematic studies have been very restricted . </S>",
    "<S> the 8 year macho monitoring of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) therefore presents an ideal opportunity to undertake such studies of be x - ray systems that lie within the monitored fields . </S>",
    "<S> here we present macho observations of two lmc be x - ray transients ,  and , the light curves of which show substantial ( 0.5 mag ) long - term variations . </S>",
    "<S> however , our analysis shows little evidence for any periodic phenomena in the light curves of either source . </S>",
    "<S> we find an upper limit for detection of a short ( 1100  d ) periodicity in the _ v_- and _ r_-band light curves of  of 0.041  mag and 0.047  mag semi - amplitude , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limits for the _ v_- and _ r_-band data of  are 0.054  mag and 0.075  mag semi - amplitude , respectively . both  and  become redder as they brighten , possibly due to variations in the structure of the equatorial disc around the be star . </S>",
    "<S> spectra of both sources show h@xmath0 emission ; for  we find the emission varies over time , thereby confirming its optical identification .    </S>",
