    "numerous methods have been proposed for measuring planetary obliquities . @xcite and @xcite demonstrated constraints on oblateness and obliquity using ingress / egress differences in transit light curves ; @xcite extended and applied these techniques to observations of hd 189733b .",

    "light curves of planets encode the viewing geometry and hence a planet s obliquity because different latitudes are impinged by starlight at different orbital phases ( this  kernel \" is described in section [ sec : kern ] ) . to see this , consider a planet with no obliquity in an edge - on , circular orbit .",
    "the star always illuminates the northern and southern hemispheres equally , and we never view some latitudes more than others . if instead this planet were tilted , the northern hemisphere would be lit first , then the southern hemisphere half an orbit later . if the planet is not north - south uniform , its apparent albedo @xcite would change during its orbit , shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : ex_lcs_edge_0q45q ] .",

    "zero - obliquity planets in edge - on orbits are similar , since more longitudes are lit near superior conjunction , or fullest phase .",

    "a complete development of this viewing geometry is provided in appendix [ sec : v_geo ] , which we summarize here .",
    "we neglect axial precession and consider planets on circular orbits . assuming a static albedo map , the reflected light seen by an observer is determined by the colatitude and longitude of the sub - stellar and sub - observer points , explicitly @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the intrinsic parameters of the system are the orbital and rotational angular frequencies , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( where positive @xmath5 is prograde ) , and the planetary obliquity , @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "extrinsic parameters differ from one observer to the next ; we denote the orbital inclination , @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is edge - on ) , and solstice phase , @xmath9 ( the orbital phase of summer solstice for the northern hemisphere ) .",
    "we also define initial conditions for orbital phase , @xmath10 , and the sub - observer longitude , @xmath11 .",
    "reflected light is then completely specified by these seven parameters and the planet s albedo map .",
    "we consider only diffuse ( lambertian ) reflection in our analysis .",
    "specular reflection , or glint , can be useful for detecting oceans @xcite , but is a localized feature and a minor fraction of the reflected light at gibbous phases .",

    "the kernel combines illumination and visibility , defined for diffuse reflection in @xcite as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the visibility and @xmath24 is the illumination .",

    "we return to rotational frequency in section [ sec : pro_ret ] .",
    "the non - zero portion of the kernel is a lune : the illuminated region of the planet that is visible to a given observer .",
    "the size of this lune depends on orbital phase , or the angle between the sub - observer and sub - stellar points .",
    "a sample kernel is shown at the top of figure [ fig : ex_kern_0xis_2panel ] , where the purple and yellow contours are visibility and illumination , respectively .",
    "the peak of the kernel is marked with an orange diamond .",
    "we begin by calculating time - dependent sines and cosines of the sub - observer and sub - stellar angles for a viewing geometry of interest ( appendix [ sec : v_geo ] ) .",
    "these are substituted into to determine visibility and illumination at any orbital phase .",
    "the two - dimensional kernel is then calculated on a @xmath28 grid in colatitude and longitude .",
    "the two - dimensional kernel , @xmath29 , is a function of latitude and longitude that varies with time and viewing geometry . for observations with minimal orbital coverage or planets that are north - south uniform , different latitudes are hard to distinguish @xcite and we use the longitudinal form of the given by @xmath30 we can approximately describe @xmath31 by a longitudinal mean , @xmath32 , and width , @xmath33 .",
    "these are defined in appendix [ sec : charact ] ; examples are shown as vertical red lines in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : ex_kern_0xis_2panel ] .",
    "for any geometry , we can calculate the two - dimensional kernel and the corresponding longitudinal width .",
    "the mean longitude is unimportant by itself because , for now , we are only concerned with the size of the kernel . we compute a four - dimensional grid of kernel widths with @xmath34 resolution in orbital phase ( time ) , inclination , obliquity , and solstice phase .",
    "the result is @xmath35 , and our numerical grid has size @xmath36 in the respective parameters .",
    "example contours from this array at first quarter phase , or @xmath37 , are shown in the left panels of figure [ fig : ex_kphith_contour_oct ] . in these plots",
    "obliquity is radial : the center is @xmath38 and the edge is @xmath39 .",
    "the azimuthal angle gives the orientation ( solstice phase ) of the planet s obliquity .",
    "for a given planet and observer , the sub - observer colatitude is fixed but the sub - stellar point moves north and south throughout the orbit if the planet has non - zero obliquity .",
    "this means different orbital phases will probe different latitudes , as dictated by the kernel .",
    "to analyze these variations we use the latitudinal form of the kernel , @xmath40 , explicitly : @xmath41 we may describe @xmath40 by its dominant colatitude @xcite , @xmath42 , also defined in appendix [ sec : charact ] and shown as a horizontal blue line at the bottom of figure [ fig : ex_kern_0xis_2panel ] . we produce a four - dimensional dominant colatitude array , @xmath43 , similarly to @xmath44 from section [ sec : lw ] . sample contours from this array at first quarter phase are shown in the right panels of figure [ fig : ex_kphith_contour_oct ] .",
    "we now consider how the longitudinal width and dominant colatitude of the kernel depend on a planet s obliquity . as a case study",
    ", we will define the inclination and spin axis of a hypothetical planet , @xmath45 : @xmath46          considering a single orbital phase defines a three - dimensional slice through @xmath44 and @xmath47 that describes the kernel at that specific time .",
    "we show the longitudinal form of the kernel for planet @xmath45 at different phases in the left panel of figure [ fig : ex_kphith_55_260_phases30 ] .",
    "lighter colors are fuller phases , indicating the kernel narrows as this planet orbits towards inferior conjunction , or @xmath48",
    ". the kernel width influences the rotational light curve at a given phase : narrower kernels can have larger amplitude variability in apparent albedo on a shorter timescale ( e.g. right of figure [ fig : ex_lcs_edge_0q45q ] ) .",
    "the latitudinal kernel for planet @xmath45 is shown similarly in the right panel of figure [ fig : ex_kphith_55_260_phases30 ] .",
    "we see that the kernel preferentially probes low and mid - latitudes during the first half - orbit .",
    "the dominant colatitude of planet @xmath45 , indicated by circles , also fluctuates during this portion of the orbit  and eventually shifts well into the northern hemisphere after inferior conjunction ( not shown ) .",
    "note that the dominant colatitude is _ not _ always at the peak of the latitudinal kernel ( see also figure [ fig : ex_kphith_225sol_obq ] ) .",
    "since one needs measurements at multiple phases to be sensitive to latitudinal variations in albedo , we will consider _ changes _ in dominant colatitude from one phase to the next , @xmath49 , for planets with north - south albedo markings .",
    "larger changes in dominant colatitude can make the apparent albedo vary more between orbital phases ( e.g. left of figure [ fig : ex_lcs_edge_0q45q ] ) .      kernel width and dominant colatitude both vary throughout a planet s orbit .",
    "we investigate this by slicing @xmath44 and @xmath47 along obliquity and/or solstice phase .",
    "to start , we vary planet @xmath45 s obliquity and track kernel width as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : ex_qtrace_wl260ph ] .",
    "the actual planet @xmath45 is denoted by a dashed green line : this planet has a narrow kernel width during the first half - orbit that widens sharply after inferior conjunction .",
    "the largest variations between the traces occur near @xmath50 .",
    "we also show tracks of dominant colatitude in the right panel of figure [ fig : ex_qtrace_wl260ph ] .",
    "what matters is the change in this characteristic between two epochs ; diverse changes in the traces occur between @xmath51 .",
    "planet @xmath45 is again the dashed green line , and near the middle of all the tracks more often than for kernel width .",
    "if one has some prior knowledge of the viewing geometry , then implies at which phases one could observe to best distinguish obliquities for planet @xmath45for example , @xmath52 .",
    "we can instead vary the solstice phase of planet @xmath45 while keeping its obliquity fixed ( not shown ) . in most cases , solstice phase impacts the kernel width and dominant colatitude as much as the axial tilt .",
    "this is expected , since obliquity is a vector quantity with both magnitude and orientation .",
    "by analyzing the kernel , we can learn how observed flux may depend on a planet s obliquity independent from its albedo map . for real observations",
    ", one would fit the light curve to directly infer the planet s albedo map @xcite and spin axis @xcite .",
    "we will use the kernel to _ predict _ how single- and dual - epoch observations constrain planetary obliquity .",
    "we address our assumptions below .",
    "the planetary inclination and orbital phase of observation must be known to model the light curve accurately .",
    "both angles might be obtained with a mixture of astrometry on the host star ( e.g. _ sim planetquest _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , direct - imaging astrometry @xcite , and/or radial velocity .",
    "we will assume that inclination and orbital phase have each been measured with @xmath53 uncertainty .",
    "extracting the albedo map and spin axis from a light curve could also be difficult in practice .",
    "planets with completely uniform albedo are not amenable to these methods .",
    "moreover , one can not distinguish latitudes for planets that are north - south uniform , nor longitudes for those that are east - west uniform . even if a planet has albedo contrast , photometric uncertainty adds noise to the reflected light measurements .",
    "contrast ratios @xmath54 are needed to resolve rotational light curves of an earth - like exoplanet @xcite , which should be achievable by a",
    "_ tpf_-type mission with high - contrast coronagraph or starshade @xcite .",
    "we will implicitly assume that planet @xmath45 has both east - west and north - south albedo markings , and thus that the kernel geometry impacts the reflected light .",
    "in particular , we will assume two scenarios : perfect knowledge of the kernel , or kernel widths and changes in dominant colatitude that are constrained to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , explained in appendix [ sec : albvar ] .",
    "note that these uncertainties will depend on the planet s albedo contrast , and the photometric precision , in a non - linear way .",
    "we envision a triage approach for direct - imaging missions : planets that vary in brightness the most , and thus have the easiest albedo maps and spin axes to infer , will be the first for follow - up observations .    of course , planetary radii are necessary to convert fluxes into apparent albedos @xcite .",
    "radii will likely be unknown , but could be approximated using mass - radius relations and mass estimates from astrometry or radial velocity , or inferred from bolometric flux using thermal infrared direct - imaging ( e.g. _ tpf - i _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "real planets may also have variable albedo maps , e.g. short - term variations from changing clouds and smaller variations from long - term seasonal changes @xcite , that could influence the apparent albedo on orbital timescales .",
    "these are difficulties that will be mitigated with each iteration of photometric detectors and theoretical models .",
    "a fit to the rotational light curve can be used to constrain the spin axis ( and longitudinal map ) of a planet with east - west albedo contrast .",
    "we can demonstrate these constraints using kernel widths in two ways , described in section [ sec : observing ] and shown in the upper panels of figure [ fig : ex_obq_mega1020_1sigsprfct ] .",
    "the dark dashed lines and square are idealized constraints when assuming perfect knowledge of the orbital geometry and two kernel widths : @xmath57 at @xmath58 , and .",
    "alternatively , the red regions have @xmath53 uncertainty on each width ( appendix [ sec : albvar ] ) , where we use a normalized gaussian probability density and include gaussian weights for uncertainties on inclination and orbital phase .",
    "the green circles represent the true planet @xmath45 spin axis , which always lies on the idealized constraints .",
    "only two spin axes are consistent with the ideal kernel widths from both orbital phases .",
    "we run more numerical experiments for a variety of system geometries ( not shown ) and find that perfect knowledge of the kernel width at three orbital phases uniquely determines the planetary spin axis .",
    "however , we find a degeneracy for planets with edge - on orbits , where two different spin configurations will produce the same kernel widths at all phases .",
    "as anticipated , we also find planet @xmath45 s spin axis ( green circle ) consistent with the uncertain kernel widths ( dark red regions ) .",
    "imperfect kernel widths at two phases allow all obliquities above @xmath59 at @xmath60 , but exclude nearly one - fifth of spin axes at @xmath61 .",
    "we find similar predictions for other orbital phases and planet parameters .",
    "these examples also suggest that obliquity could be constrained for planets with variable albedo maps . as long as albedo only changes on timescales longer than the rotational period",
    ", light curves will constrain both the instantaneous map and the planet s spin axis . a given spin orientation and",
    "orbital inclination dictates a specific kernel width as a function of orbital phase ( left panel of figure [ fig : ex_qtrace_wl260ph ] ) , so we predict that light curves at three phases will be sufficient to pin down the planetary obliquity , even if the planet s map varies between phases .",
    "a fit to light curves from different orbital phases can be used to constrain the spin axis ( and latitudinal map ) of a planet with north - south albedo contrast . as described in section [ sec : observing ] , we can demonstrate this constraint using both perfect and uncertain knowledge of the change in dominant colatitude .",
    "our predictions are shown in the lower left panel of figure [ fig : ex_obq_mega1020_1sigsprfct ] .",
    "the idealized constraint here is @xmath62 between @xmath63 .",
    "since the change in dominant colatitude is constrained between pairs of epochs , four orbital phases are needed to produce three independent constraints and uniquely determine planet @xmath45 s spin axis .",
    "we find the same two - fold degeneracy as before for planets in edge - on orbits , even if one knows the change in dominant colatitude between all pairs of phases .    for the blue regions ,",
    "we reapply our probability density from above and assume @xmath64 uncertainty on the change in dominant colatitude ( appendix [ sec : albvar ] ) .",
    "the distribution is bimodal because only the _ magnitude _ of the change can be constrained , not its direction .",
    "this means an observer would not know whether more northern or southern latitudes are probed at the later phase , affecting which spin axes are inferred .      for a planet with both east - west and north - south albedo contrast",
    ", one may combine longitudinal and latitudinal information to better constrain the planet s spin axis ( and two - dimensional map ) .",
    "we show this for planet @xmath45 in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : ex_obq_mega1020_1sigsprfct ] .",
    "the idealized constraint shows that only the true spin configuration is allowed .",
    "we find this result for other system geometries  except using orbital phases @xmath65 apart , which creates a two - way degeneracy in the spin axis .",
    "the confidence regions in purple assume our notional uncertainties on both kernel width and change in dominant colatitude ( appendix [ sec : albvar ] ) .",
    "this prediction is not unimodal , but the @xmath60 region excludes obliquities below @xmath66 .",
    "a distant observer would know that this planet s obliquity has probably not been eroded by tides @xcite , and that the planet likely experiences obliquity seasons .",
    "the sign of rotational angular frequency ( positive = prograde ) can affect the mean longitude of the kernel , but not its size and shape .",
    "there is a formal degeneracy for edge - on , zero - obliquity cases : prograde planets with east - oriented maps have identical light curves to retrograde planets with west - oriented maps .",
    "the motion of the kernel peak is the same over either version of the planet , implying the retrograde rotation in an inertial frame is _ slower _ ( ) .",
    "we show this scenario in the left panel of figure  [ fig : ex_acurveb_edge_7525165_q ] , where the dashed brown line is the difference in prograde and retrograde apparent albedo .",
    "the orange and black planets are always equally bright because the same map features , in the upper panels , are seen at the same times .",
    "however , the spin direction of oblique planets and/or those on inclined orbits may be deduced .",
    "inclinations that are not edge - on most strongly alter a planet s light curve near inferior conjunction , seen in the center panel of figure [ fig : ex_acurveb_edge_7525165_q ] : this planet s properties are intermediate between the edge - on , zero - obliquity planet and . while a typical observatory s inner working angle would hide some of the signal , differences on the order of 0.1 in the apparent albedo would be detectable at extreme crescent phases",
    ". alternatively , higher obliquity causes deviations that  depending on solstice phase  can arise around one or both quarter phases .",
    "this happens for planet @xmath45 in the right panel of figure [ fig : ex_acurveb_edge_7525165_q ] , where both effects combine to distinguish the spin direction at most phases .",
    "inclination and obliquity influence apparent albedo because the longitudinal motion of the kernel peak is _ not _ the same at all latitudes .",
    "one can break this spin degeneracy in principle , but we have not fully explored the pro / retrograde parameter space . in general , the less inclined and/or oblique a planet is , the more favorable crescent phases are for determining its spin direction .",
    "we have performed numerical experiments to study the problem of inferring a planet s obliquity from time - resolved photometry , for arbitrary albedo maps and viewing geometries .",
    "we have demonstrated that a planet s obliquity will influence its light curve in two distinct ways : one involving east - west albedo markings and another involving north - south markings .",
    "provided this planet is not completely uniform , one could constrain both its albedo map and spin axis using reflected light .",
    "the kernel  the product of visibility and illumination  has a peak , a longitudinal width , and a mean latitude that vary in time and are functions of viewing geometry .",
    "analyzing the kernel enables us to predict constraints on a planet s spin axis from reflected light , including for maps that are east - west uniform ( e.g. jupiter - like ) or north - south uniform ( e.g. beach ball - like ) .",
    "curiously , we find that kernel width offers better constraints on obliquity than dominant colatitude , suggesting that east - west albedo contrast is generally more useful than north - south contrast .",
    "this is partly because kernel width can be constrained even for variable albedo maps .",
    "furthermore , monitoring a planet at only a few epochs could determine its spin direction and significantly constrain its obliquity .",
    "in our case study of planet @xmath45 , we find crescent phases are favorable for telling prograde from retrograde rotation .",
    "similarly , perfect knowledge of the kernel width at two orbital phases narrows the possible spin axes for planet @xmath45 to two distinct configurations , while kernel width uncertainties of @xmath53 still exclude about three - quarters of spin axes at @xmath60 . adding the constraint on change in dominant colatitude between the same two phases completely specifies the true spin configuration of planet @xmath45 .",
    "a change in dominant colatitude with @xmath64 uncertainty excludes five - sixths of spin orientations at @xmath60 .",
    "most importantly , we also find that perfect knowledge of the kernel width at just three phases , or its change in dominant colatitude between four phases , is generally sufficient to uniquely determine a planet s obliquity .",
    "this suggests that  in principle  rotational light curves at 24 distinct orbital phases uniquely constrain the spin axis of any planet with non - uniform albedo .",
    "this is good news for inferring the obliquity of planets with future direct - imaging missions .",

    "the time - dependence of the kernel is contained in the sub - observer and sub - stellar angles : @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "since they do not depend on planetary latitude or longitude , these four angles may be factored out of the kernel integrals .",
    "however , the light curves are still functions of time , so we derive the relevant dependencies here .    in particular , we compute the sub - stellar and sub - observer locations for planets on circular orbits using seven parameters .",
