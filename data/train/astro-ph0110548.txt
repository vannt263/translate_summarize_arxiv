    "hydrogen deuteride ( hd ) is the simplest and most abundant deuterated molecule .",
    "its detection permits in principle a determination of the cosmic deuterium abundance , and thereby places constraints on the physical conditions during cosmic nucleosynthesis .",
    "two pure rotational lines of hd have been detected by the short ( sws ) and long ( lws ) wavelength spectrometers on the infrared space observatory ( iso ) .",
    "wright et al . ( 1999 ) detected the 0 - 0 r(0 ) transition ( i.e. , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) line at 112  @xmath0 m toward the orion bar photodissociation region , and from an estimate of the h@xmath6 column density and by assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) for hd , they determined a deuterium abundance ratio , [ d]/[h ] @xmath11 .",
    "bertoldi et al .",
    "( 1999 ; hereafter b1999 ) reported a detection of the 0 - 0 r(5 ) line at 19.43  @xmath0 m toward orion peak  1 , the brightest position of shocked h@xmath6 line emission in the orion omc-1 outflow ( beckwith et al . 1978 ) .",
    "they also derive upper limits to the fluxes of sixteen pure rotational and vibration - rotation lines toward the same position . combining their hd detection with observations of h@xmath6 lines by rosenthal , bertoldi & drapatz ( 2000 ; hereafter r2000 ) , they estimate [ d]/[h]@xmath12 .",
    "their estimate takes into account the depletion of hd relative to h@xmath6 that occurs in warm and partially dissociated gas , from which much of the line emission is thought to arise .",
    "there are two major sources of uncertainty in the deuterium abundance estimates derived from the mid - ir hd and h@xmath6 emission lines .",
    "one is the possibility of variations of [ hd]/[h@xmath6 ] in warm , partially dissociated gas , where the exothermic chemical reaction @xmath14 depletes hd relative to h@xmath6 ( timmermann 1996 , 1998 ; b1999 ) .",
    "if the dissociation fractions of hd and h@xmath6 differ and vary along the line of sight , the observations yield convolved averages over abundance and excitation gradients , from which a deuterium abundance can not be derived directly .",
    "the second major uncertainty is the derivation of an hd column density from the measurement of but a single excited level . in the absence of any constraint on the hd excitation , b1999",
    "initially assume that the hd giving rise to the observed emission has the same excitation as the observed post - shock h@xmath6 .",
    "using this assumption , which essentially presumes that both h@xmath6 and hd are populated according to a lte , they derive an hd column density @xmath15 .",
    "b1999 then note that , unlike h@xmath6 levels at comparable energy , hd(0,6 ) would not be expected to be populated according to lte , mainly because hd has a faster radiative deexcitation than h@xmath6 , and the `` critical density '' for hd(0,6 ) exceeds that which is expected to exist in the emitting gas , @xmath16 . from extensive modelling of the hd level populations ,",
    "b1999 derive a a factor of 1.5 ( see section 3.4 of b1999 ) to account approximately for the sub - lte excitation of hd(0,6 ) and adjust the total hd column upward .    this uncertainty in whether or not the hd level populations are in lte , and hence whether the column density should be corrected for non - lte ,",
    "can only be resolved by measuring transitions from different hd levels . here",
    "we report the detection at peak 1 of the hd 1 - 0 r(5 ) line at 2.46  @xmath0 m .",
    "the upper level of this line is 7,747  k above ground ( calculated from the vibrational constants of herzberg 1950 and the rotational constants of essenwanger & gush 1984 ) , compared to 2,636  k for the 0 - 0 r(5 ) line ( b1999 ) .",
    "measurement of a second emission line of hd at peak  1 allows a first determination of the hd excitation in shock - excited gas .",
    "the observations were made at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on the night of 1999 january 20 ut , using the facility infrared spectrometer , cgs4 ( mountain et al .",
    "the instrument contains a 256@xmath17256 element insb array .",
    "the echelle in cgs4 was used in twenty - second order with a 2-pixel wide ( 0.82@xmath18 ) slit to provide a spectral resolving power of @xmath1918,500 and wavelength coverage of 0.017  @xmath0 m near 2.46  @xmath0 m .",
    "the length of a pixel along the slit was 0.91@xmath18 .",
    "the hd 1 - 0 r(5 ) line ( 2.458775  @xmath0 m , rich , jones & mckellar 1982 ) is located at the long wavelength end of the k window where the atmospheric transparency is generally poor ; however , on mauna kea this hd line is well isolated from nearby strong telluric lines .",
    "the atmospheric model spectrum generator , atran ( lord 1992 ) was used to determine this and it was confirmed by the observations .",
    "the h@xmath6 1 - 0 q(5 ) line at 2.45476  @xmath0 m also falls in the observed wavelength range , and is valuable for calibrating these observations with those done using iso .",
    "the observations towards peak  1 were made with the slit of cgs4 oriented east - west and with row 84 of the array centered at @xmath20(2000)@xmath21 5@xmath22 35@xmath23 13.7@xmath24 , @xmath25(2000)@xmath265@xmath2722  8.5 .",
    "the position was achieved by offsetting from near - by visible stars and is accurate to better than 1arcsecond .",
    "this is the position for peak 1 first identified by beckwith et al ( 1978 ) and the iso beam was centred on this position ( b1999 ) . following each on - source exposure of 120 seconds",
    "the telescope was offset to a sky position 5 arcmin east of peak  1 .",
    "sky and source frames were repeated until the total on - source exposure time was 40 minutes .",
    "flat - field frames were also obtained .",
    "individual exposures were flat - fielded and sky - subtracted , and the sky - subtracted pairs were despiked before being coadded .",
    "wavelength calibration utilized telluric lines in the observed spectrum of the standard star ( wavelengths are given in vacuo throughout this paper ) .",
    "the rms accuracy of this calibration is estimated to be @xmath28 . the g4v star hr  2007 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30  k assumed ) was observed before and after the observations of peak  1 ; its spectrum was used to correct for telluric features in the atmosphere and to provide flux calibration .",
    "weak stellar features were removed from the spectrum of hr  2007 before ratioing , using the solar spectrum ( livingston & wallace 1991 ) as a template .",
    "no stellar features are closely coincident with the hd line wavelength .",
    "the seeing was poor during the observations and from the intensity profile of the calibration star along the slit it is estimated that @xmath31% of the flux from the star passed through the cgs4 slit .",
    "this 20% uncertainty is included in the uncertainties in the line fluxes reported below .",
    "the statistical uncertainties associated with the hd line are less than this .",
    "the spectrum of peak  1 is shown in fig .",
    "the h@xmath6 1 - 0 q(5 ) line , which dominates the spectrum , has a flux of @xmath32 , a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.00041  @xmath0 m ( @xmath33 ) and a full width at 10 percent of 0.0018  @xmath0 m ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the broad line widths are due to the fact that the h@xmath6 in this region is predominantly excited by shocks , as has long been established ( e.g. , nadeau , geballe , & neugebauer 1982 ) .",
    "the resolution of the spectrum is @xmath35 , and thus the deconvolved widths are only marginally less than the above values .",
    "the fwhm is in close agreement with that previously observed for the h@xmath6 1 - 0 s(1 ) line ( nadeau & geballe 1979 ; chrysostomou et al .",
    "1997 ; stolovy et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the much fainter hd 1 - 0 r(5 ) line is clearly detected ; its centroid is @xmath36 m ( in vacuo ) .",
    "it is almost 1000 times fainter than the h@xmath6 q - branch line .",
    "the flux in the line is @xmath37 where about half of the uncertainties are due to the systematic uncertainty in the flux calibration . even in this small bright region ,",
    "the surface brightness is a factor of 5 lower than the limits measured by iso for other 1 - 0 band hd lines ( b1999 ) .",
    "the fwhm of the hd line , estimated from the locations of the line shoulders , is @xmath38 ( the uncertainty is 1  @xmath39 ) , in bare agreement with the h@xmath6 1 - 0 q(5 ) line width .",
    "no clear central peak is seen , unlike for the h@xmath6 line , but this could be due to noise fluctuations .    to confirm the identification of the weak line as due to hd , we have checked the wavelength in two ways .",
    "first , from the laboratory wavelength of the hd line , the lsr velocity of peak  1 ( @xmath40 , chrysostomou et al .",
    "1997 ) and the doppler shift ( + 16 km s@xmath41 ) due to the earth s orbital motion on the date of the observation , the peak of the hd line is calculated to occur at a laboratory vacuum wavelength of @xmath42  @xmath0 m .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the measured line centroid , which we expect should be shifted only marginally ( @xmath43 m ) from the peak , as in the case of the h@xmath44 line .",
    "second , the shift of the hd line between the laboratory and observed wavelengths , 0.00044  @xmath0 m , is the same sign and nearly the same magnitude as the shift of the h@xmath44 line ( 0.00031  @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the difference of these shifts is less than the resolution of the spectrum .",
    "moreover , while extensive line lists reveal a few atomic and ionic lines ( ca i , cu iii , piv , sc i ) with wavelengths within 0.0001  @xmath0 m of the hd laboratory wavelength , none would be expected to have a spatial distribution roughly mimicking that of h@xmath44 . to test this , we examined the eight rows adjacent to the central eight brightest rows , both to the east and west along the cgs4 slit .",
    "the ratio of the hd line to the h@xmath6 line is the same to within the estimated uncertainty of 30% .",
    "these tests demonstrate that the newly detected line indeed is the hd 1 - 0 r(5 ) transition .",
    "the h@xmath6 1 - 0 q(5 ) and hd 1 - 0 r(5 ) lines observed at ukirt can be compared with previous iso observations centred on the same region ( r2000 ) .",
    "the cgs4 and iso surface brightnesses and beam sizes are summarised in table 1 .",
    "the ground - based observation yields a surface brightness which is ( 2.1@xmath450.4 ) times larger than the value measured with iso .",
    "the difference between the ukirt and iso measurements can be attributed to the greatly different apertures of the two measurements .",
    "whereas the iso observation averaged the emission over a large aperture centered on peak  1 , the cgs4 flux was determined from the brightest eight adjacent rows in the peak 1 spectrum , a solid angle of just 6  arcsec@xmath3 . to compare the observed flux from the hd 0 - 0 r(5 ) line observed by iso and the hd 1 - 0 r(5 ) line ,",
    "we compensate for the different beam sizes using the difference in the h@xmath6 line fluxes as a beam dilution factor . in using the difference in the h@xmath6 fluxes to correct the hd line",
    ", we are assuming that the h@xmath6 and hd emissions have the same spatial distributions and that the portions of peak  1 sampled by cgs4 and by iso have the same excitation . the rough similarity the spatial distribution of hd and h@xmath6 line emissions along the slit was already pointed out in section  3.1 .",
    "rosenthal et al .",
    "( 2000 ) attribute only @xmath195% of the emission in the iso beam to the pdr bordering the foreground orion nebula hii region and it is unlikely that the percentage has large variations within the iso beam .",
    "therefore one can safely assume cgs4 slit samples h@xmath6 with the same excitation as the iso beam .",
    "the hd 0 - 0 r(5 ) flux measured with iso was averaged over an even larger aperture of 380 arcsec@xmath3 , so that there could be a modest difference in beam dilution factors between the aperture in which the h@xmath6 1 - 0 q(5 ) line flux was derived and the hd 0 - 0 r(5 ) .",
    "we ignore this possibility , and for a comparison of the hd 0 - 0 r(5 ) and 1 - 0 r(5 ) line fluxes , we adopt a beam dilution factor of 2.1 , with a 20% uncertainty . in other words , we decrease the ukirt hd line surface brightness by a factor of 2.1 for comparison with the iso hd line .",
    "the hd 1 - 0 r(5 ) average brightness observed in the 6 arcsec@xmath3 aperture can be converted to an average hd column density for the level from which this transition arises , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , through @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the einstein-@xmath49 coefficient ( table  [ tab-2 ] ) , and @xmath50 is the line of sight extinction at the line wavelength , @xmath51 . adopting the values in table  1 and an extinction of 0.78 mag at 2.455  @xmath0 m , which was derived by b1999 and r2000 ( their table  3 ) from the relative h@xmath6 line intensities , the observed line flux yields    @xmath52    to compare this with the hd @xmath53 column density derived by b1999",
    ", we correct the ukirt column by @xmath54 as justified above , obtaining @xmath55 , compared with @xmath56 found by b1999 .",
    "figure 2 is an amended version of fig .  6 from b1999 , now including our new measurement .",
    "the figure includes a line which the hd level column densities follow _ if they have the same excitation as h@xmath6_. there is a good agreement of our new measurement with the prediction made by this line , which indicates that the relative excitation of the hd(0,6 ) and hd(1,6 ) levels is the same as that we find for h@xmath6 levels at similar energies .",
    "this is rather surprising , since one might have expected that the population of these high hd levels would drop below those of equivalent h@xmath6 levels , due to the faster radiative deexcitation rates of hd compared to h@xmath6 .",
    "the radiative transition probabilities of hd are much larger than those of h@xmath44 because , unlike h@xmath44 , ro - vibrationally excited hd can decay through the emission of electromagnetic dipole radiation .",
    "the total radiative decay rate of the hd(1,6 ) level , e.g. , is @xmath57 , whereas that of h@xmath44(1,4 ) , which is at comparable excitation energy , is about 60 times smaller . with comparable collisional excitation rates ,",
    "the level populations of h@xmath44 and hd are expected to be quite different , unless the gas density is very high , @xmath58 @xmath59 , which seems unlikely .",
    "why does the hd excitation shown by the levels ( 0,6 ) and ( 1,6 ) appear to mimic the excitation of h@xmath6 at similar level energies ?",
    "we suggest that the cause may be excitation coupling between hd and h@xmath6 . in shock - heated ,",
    "partially dissociated gas the exchange reaction @xmath60 occurs . if the reaction time for this is faster than the time for collisional and radiative equilibrium of hd energy levels to be established , the hd level populations will be coupled to that of h@xmath6 through the reactive collisions . because the abundance of hd is much smaller than that of h@xmath6 , the average h@xmath6 level population would not be significantly affected .    the hd radiative decay time is roughly @xmath61 seconds for the @xmath46 levels .",
    "vibrational relaxation of hd(@xmath46)@xmath62 through non - reactive collisions ( @xmath63 sec and @xmath64 sec at 1000  k and 2000  k , respectively ) is slower than this at typical post - shock temperatures and densities .",
    "thus it is just the radiative time that must be compared with the reaction times .",
    "there are two of the latter : the time that @xmath65 is converted by the above forward reaction to h@xmath6 and the time that hd@xmath66 is formed from h@xmath6 ( through the reverse reaction ) .",
    "if these times are shorter , then the hd@xmath66 abundance is driven by reactive collisions and both molecules show nearly the same vibrational excitation , with hd effectively becoming part of the h@xmath6 level system .    the important reaction rates in eqn .",
    "( 3 ) are those that form hd@xmath66 .",
    "because only a small fraction of the h@xmath6 is vibrationally excited , h@xmath67v=0@xmath68+d @xmath69 hd@xmath66+h is the fastest production channel of hd@xmath66 , even though per molecule h@xmath6(@xmath46 ) is more effective ( timmermann 1996 ; rozenshtein et al .",
    "1985 ) . after employing the results of gray & balint - kurti ( 1998 ) and zhang & miller ( 1989 )",
    ", we find a rate coefficient @xmath70 for @xmath71 at 2000  k. per unit volume , the `` chemical excitation '' rate of h@xmath72hd@xmath66 is then @xmath73 , compared with the hd@xmath74hd radiative decay rate of @xmath75 .",
    "the formation of hd@xmath66 is faster than its decay when    @xmath76    for gas entering a partially dissociative c - type shock , the atomic hydrogen abundance grows as the gas heats .",
    "the deuterium fraction [ d]/[hd ] can be computed from detailed balance of the hd - h@xmath6 exchange reaction .",
    "equation  ( 48 ) of timmermann ( 1996 ) should read @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 is the total partition function .",
    "the h@xmath81+d system lies @xmath82=418  k above that of hd(@xmath9)+h , and the h@xmath6(@xmath46)+d system lies 1183 k above that of hd(@xmath46)+h . for the hd(@xmath9)@xmath69h@xmath6(@xmath9 ) exchange reaction , detailed balance yields @xmath83 / [ { \\rm hd}]}~=~2.3~ ( [ { \\rm h } ] / [ { \\rm h_2}])~~e^{-418{\\rm k}/t}.\\ ] ] then eq .",
    "( 4 ) becomes @xmath84    in the portion of the post - shock region where the bulk of the observed @xmath1 line emission occurs , the temperature is likely to be @xmath192000  k. there the fraction of h@xmath6 in the @xmath46 state is @xmath190.05 and that of hd would be similar if it were coupled to h@xmath6 . however , the temperature profile of the shocked gas is not well known .",
    "we therefore also estimate the excited fraction from the data of b1999 and r2000 , who observed the h@xmath6 level populations over the line of sight of shock - heated and cooling gas , which includes the entire range of temperatures .",
    "we obtain @xmath85 .",
    "the relevant abundance fraction should lie between these two extremes .",
    "we adopt @xmath86 = 0.01 in the region where much of the observed hd emission arises .",
    "the atomic hydrogen density above which the hd@xmath66 abundance is dominated by h@xmath6-hd reactive collisions is then @xmath87 . for comparison , at 2000  k",
    "the critical h density for lte excitation of hd@xmath66 is @xmath88 .    in orion the density of atomic hydrogen in c",
    "- shocks is believed to be well in excess of @xmath89 in the front ( timmermann 1996 ; timmermann 1998 ; b1999 ) .",
    "thus partially dissociative shocks appear to be able to couple hd strongly to h@xmath6 over much of the warm shock layers . in regions with lower temperatures",
    "the exchange reactions are slower , but the hd@xmath66 fraction is also lower , so that the critical density ( eq.[eq : nhcrit ] ) should not change much between 1000 k and 2000 k.",
    "we have found that the excitation of hd that is apparent through the hd(0,6 ) and hd(1,6 ) levels is very similar to the excitation observed ( although averaged over a larger region ) for h@xmath6 at these level energies . because of the lack of more information on the hd level distribution , especially for the lower energy states @xmath9 , @xmath90 , we assume that the hd and h@xmath6 excitations are indeed similar . under this assumption",
    "we can compute the hd partition sum to derive the total hd column density .",
    "since hd is somewhat depleted relative to h@xmath6 in the warmest shock layers , the average excitation conditions of hd might be somewhat different from those of h@xmath6 .",
    "the lower hd levels are predominantly populated by cooler gas that does not couple to h@xmath6 , but in this gas the low level populations may well follow lte , so that hd and h@xmath6 would show a similar excitation .",
    "our assumption of identical excitation for hd and h@xmath6 is therefore a reasonable one . ideally , one would like to measure the level populations of the lower hd levels , but the corresponding infrared lines are only accessible from space with sufficient sensitivity .",
    "upper limits derived from iso measurments ( see fig .",
    "2 ) yield constraints only within a factor ten from the adopted level populations .    adopting the h@xmath6 excitation measured by iso , the total ( warm ) hd column density",
    "is that given by b1999 as @xmath91 , compared with @xmath92 .",
    "accounting for a 40% depletion of hd relative to h@xmath6 in warm , partially dissociated gas ( see b1999 for a detailed justification of this factor ) , we derive a deuterium abundance [ d]/[h]@xmath93 . this value is lower than the @xmath94 found by b1999 , because they expected a lower excitation of hd relative to that seen for h@xmath6 .",
    "the deuterium abundance we derive is the lowest value yet measured .",
    "its typical range derived through deuterium absorption measurments in the local ism is @xmath95 .",
    "recent measurments by jenkins et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and sonneborn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) however show that the abundance of atomic deuterium does vary signifianctly along different lines of sight .",
    "our low value is comparable to the low value derived from absorption measurments toward @xmath25 ori a ( jenkins et al .",
    "1999 ) , which yielded @xmath96 .",
    "we have detected an emission line of vibrationally excited hd toward orion peak 1 .",
    "the two hd lines now detected from this region arise from widely different energy levels and their relative strengths surprisingly indicate a similar excitation as h@xmath6 , in spite of the considerably different spontaneous deexcitation rates of these isotopic molecular species .",
    "we propose that the similarity in excitation is due to the strong coupling of the hd and h@xmath6 systems through reactive collisions and we have revised the deuterium abundance at peak  1 in view of the higher than expected excitation of hd .",
