    "heavy - metallic oxide ( hmo ) glasses have attracted much attention due to their unique non - linear optical properties.@xcite their rapid dielectric - response times , on the order of femtoseconds , are much sought after for use in high - speed optical devices , an application for which homogeneous amorphous materials are ideal candidates .",
    "the antimony oxides , sb@xmath3o@xmath4 , have been known as glass formers since the 1930s.@xcite there have been experimental studies of glassy antimony oxides using both glass stabilizers@xcite and vitrifying matrices.@xcite several problems are yet to be solved , however , in particular the issue that the non - linear optical properties of antimony - oxide glasses tend to degrade rapidly as the proportion of the vitrifying matrix increases,@xcite and anionic glass stabilizers ( e.g. halides@xcite or phosphates@xcite ) tend to result in the formation of microcrystallites and/or to lead to local variation in chemical composition.@xcite in order to overcome the present challenges , it is desirable to investigate high - purity amorphous phases of antimony oxides . in this study , we provide theoretical predictions of the properties of a series of single - component amorphous antimony oxides at different oxidation levels .    in order to understand the local and long - range structure of glassy materials , it is useful to use the crystalline phases with equivalent composition as a reference . whereas glass materials do not possess a regular atomic geometry , the local atomic arrangements tend to resemble those found in the crystalline counterparts.@xcite in accordance with the stoichiometries of known crystalline antimony oxides , we examine three different compositions of amorphous antimony oxide .",

    "covalently - bonded sb@xmath7o@xmath9 units are closely packed in a face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice .",
    "the building block of these units is the pyramidal sbo@xmath1 motif , in which sb occupies the center of an elongated tetrahedron with o at three vertex points and the lone - pair electrons of sb(iii ) occupying the fourth .",
    "the sb@xmath7o@xmath9 motif consists of four of these pyramids forming a closed cage - like structure .",
    "valentinite is also composed of sbo@xmath1 pyramids , but instead of forming a caged structure , they form a more highly - connected double - chain structure , which transforms to a double - wire structure under pressure .",
    "a notable difference between @xmath8- and @xmath2sb@xmath0o@xmath1 is also evident in the bond - angle distribution function , i.e. a histogram of the three - atom bond angles in the structure .",
    "the sbo@xmath1 pyramidal unit in senarmontite gives rise to a characteristic o ",
    "sb  o bonding angle of 95.7@xmath10 , whereas the arrangement in valentinite leads to three different o  sb  o angles .",
    "a third phase , @xmath11 , with regular three - dimensional connectivity , also exists , and it is of interest to see how this structural variation is reflected in the glass network in _ a_sb@xmath0o@xmath1 .    with elevated oxygen partial pressure and high temperature , antimony pentoxide ( sb@xmath0o@xmath6 ) becomes stable up to about 1250k.@xcite the lone - pair electrons are not present in sb@xmath0o@xmath6 , and instead six - coordinate oxygen atoms form a slightly distorted octahedral arrangement around sb(v ) ions ( o  sb  o bonding angle : 169.2@xmath10 ) . at an intermediate oxidation level , @xmath8sb@xmath0o@xmath7 and @xmath2sb@xmath0o@xmath7",

    "this method is advantageous over a simple randomization , since it captures the physical interactions between atoms at elevated temperature .",
    "the resulting liquid structures were then quenched to 300k over 20 ps , giving a cooling rate of 35kps@xmath18 .",
    "a uniform time step of 2fs was used , for a total simulation time of 50ps , with each trajectory therefore consisting of 25,000 timesteps .",
    "the md simulations were carried out at constant volume , with the density set to the average density of the crystalline phases reduced by 5% , as suggested in ref .. the canonical ( _ nvt _ ) ensemble , in which the volume of the cell is fixed , avoids some complexities associated with the _ npt _ ensemble , in particular the slow equilibration of the various barostats commonly used in such simulations .",
    "amorphous materials are typically , although not always , less dense than their crystalline counterparts , and , as noted by vanderbilt and coworkers , constraining the density to too high a value can prohibit amorphization . therefore , we ran the melt - quench aimd simluations at a lower density than the crystalline phases , and then subsequently volume - relaxed the quenched structures .",
    "after the simulated melt - and - quenching process followed by volume relaxation , the calculated density of the amorphous models were 5.59g/@xmath19 for _ a_sb@xmath0o@xmath1 , 6.05g/@xmath19 for _ a_sb@xmath0o@xmath7 , and 6.01g/@xmath19 for _ a_sb@xmath0o@xmath6 .",

    "however , these defects are absent after quenching , and do not reform upon relaxation of the forces .",
    "the fact that these defects can form at high oxidation level suggests that sb(v ) can be reduced to sb(iv / iii ) in the amorphous material , which in turn suggests that in a suitable form the material could catalyse redox processes ( e.g. as nanoparticles or through surface sites ) .",

    "however , this discussion is potentially interesting in light of the fact that amorphous catalysts are an active area of research in the community.@xcite    it is worth noting that in real systems peroxide defects may be oxidised and leave the material as molecular oxygen , for example during quenching or after vitrification , which is not possible in our periodic simulations .",
