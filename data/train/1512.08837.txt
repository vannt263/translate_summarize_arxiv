    "turbulence can come from deterministic chaos @xcite . for dynamical systems",
    "the _ exponential _ power spectra is strong indication of chaotic dynamics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the exponential spectra were also observed for the transitional and turbulent fluid motions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these motions were strongly anisotropic , but what can one say about isotropic turbulence ? is the isotropic turbulence related to the deterministic chaos ?",
    "the exponential spectra were not observed in this turbulence even for small values of reynolds number . in order to approach to this problem",
    "let us start from the nature of the exponential spectra in chaotic dynamical systems .",
    "recently certain progress was made in this direction in relation to deterministic chaos in plasmas dynamics @xcite .",
    "it was suggested there that the observed exponential spectra are provided by pulses having a lorentzian functional form @xcite .",
    "namely , for an individual lorentzian pulse centred at time @xmath3 and having width @xmath4 the temporal shape in the complex time plain is @xmath5   \\eqno{(1)}\\ ] ] then , for @xmath6 lorentzian pulses the power spectrum is a sum over the residues of the complex time poles @xmath7 for a narrow distribution of the pulse widths the eq .",
    "( 2 ) gives an exponential spectrum @xmath8 that is usually observed in the chaotic dynamical systems .",
    "but what if we have a broad ( continuous ) distribution of the pulse widths ( as one can expect for isotropic turbulence ) ?",
    "in this case the sum eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be approximated by a weighted superposition of the exponential functions eq .",
    "( 3 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a probability distribution of @xmath11 . if the distribution is narrow and can be approximated by a delta - function then we have the exponential spectrum .",
    "one can look at this problem as a kind of relaxation problem in a disordered medium ( see for instance ref .",
    "namely , if one consider a global relaxation in a medium with a large number of independently relaxing species ( each of which decays exponentially ) and the rates of the individual exponential relaxations are different ( statistically independent ) , then one can describe the global relaxation as a weighted linear superposition of the individual exponential functions in an integral form like eq .",
    "it is well known ( but still not understood ) that for such problems the weighted superposition of the type eq ( 4 ) is commonly converged to a _ stretched _ exponential @xcite .",
    "let us make use of a dimensionless variable : @xmath12 ( where the @xmath13 is a dimensional constant ) : @xmath14 then the universal stretched exponential can be written as @xmath15 where the constant @xmath16 .",
    "one can solve an inverse problem and find the @xmath17 resulting in eq .",
    "( 6 ) . except the case of @xmath18",
    "the expression for @xmath19 is rather cumbersome ( see ref .",
    "it can be useful to mention that @xmath19 are asymmetric levy stable distributions .",
    "due to the levy - gnedenko generalization of the central limit theorem the levy distributions are ubiquitous in nature @xcite . for isotropic turbulence the frequency spectrum eq .",
    "( 6 ) can be transformed into wave number spectrum @xmath20 and just this spectrum should be considered as a manifestation of the distributed chaos .",
    "an example of the distributed chaos one can find in ref . @xcite .",
    "asymptotic behaviour of @xmath17 at @xmath21 @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant , can be used for an estimation of @xmath1 for the isotropic turbulence . in order to make use of this asymptotic",
    "let us consider an asymptotic of the group velocity @xmath24 of the waves ( pulses ) driving the distributed chaos at @xmath25 ( do not confuse the @xmath26 with the velocity field and the wave number @xmath27 with the wave number @xmath28 ) . if at this asymptotic the group velocity has a scaling dependence on @xmath27 @xmath29 then in order to find the exponent @xmath30 one needs to know a dimensional parameter dominating this process .",
    "it is well known that for the isotropic turbulence not only viscosity ( molecular diffusion ) determines the processes at @xmath25 . due to nonlinearity of the navier - stokes equations the nonlocal ( long - range ) interactions penetrate even into the deep dissipation range .",
    "the interplay of the nonlocality and viscosity is rather complex in this asymptotic .",
    "the opposite asymptotic @xmath31 for the velocity field is also a subject for an interplay of the long - range interactions and viscosity .",
    "three fundamental conservation laws : energy , momentum and angular momentum , are the main source for dimensional parameters governing scaling relations in the isotropic turbulence and determining corresponding scaling exponents @xcite .",
    "the energy conservation law was reserved by a. kolmogorov for the inertial range of scales where the viscosity effects are negligible @xcite ( see also next section ) .",
    "therefore , we remain with the conservation of momentum and angular momentum for the two asymptotic cases mentioned above .",
    "both of the conservation laws were already tried in the literature for the second one from these two asymptotic .",
    "namely , birkhoff - saffman and loitsyanskii integrals ( invariants ) are associated with the conservation laws of momentum and angular momentum , correspondingly @xcite-@xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the longitudinal correlation function of the velocity field . for @xmath34 eq .",
    "( 10 ) corresponds to the birkhoff - saffman invariant and for @xmath35 to the loitsyanskii invariant .",
    "since conservation of the loitsyansky integral @xmath36 depends on the type of large - scale correlations in the initial turbulent flow and , therefore , is non universal , we remain with the birkhoff - saffman invariant for determining the scaling exponent in the eq .",
    "( 9 ) from the dimensional consideration :    @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a dimensionless constant .    if @xmath39 has a gaussian distribution at this asymptotic : @xmath40 , then @xmath27 has asymptotic distribution @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath43 and substituting eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 12 ) into equation @xmath44 we obtain @xmath45 .",
    "figure 1 shows the three - dimensional energy spectrum from a high - resolution direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of homogeneous steady three - dimensional turbulence @xcite for the taylor - scale reynolds number @xmath46 .",
    "the scales in this figure are chosen in order to represent the eq .",

    "the straight line is drawn in this figure in order to indicate the eq .",

    "the @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 is the kinematic viscosity , and @xmath49 is is the mean rate of the energy dissipation @xcite ) is the dissipation ( kolmogorov s ) wavenumber .",
    "the stretched exponential covers about entire available data range and penetrates into the dissipation range @xmath50 without any problem .",
    "but the kolmogorov s scale @xmath51 is still relevant to the situation because the scale @xmath52 turned out to be practically independent on the reynolds number @xmath53 being represented in the terms of @xmath51 : @xmath54 ( using the theory of equilibrium between chaotic and stochastic components of turbulence suggested in ref . @xcite one can obtain a theoretical estimate @xmath55 ) .",

    ".    in order to show emergence of the inertial ( kolmogorov ) range adjacent to the range of the distributed chaos with the increase of @xmath53 we show in figure 3 the same data as in fig . 2 but in the log - log scales ( where the power - law spectrum corresponds to a straight line )",
    "actually the range of the distributed chaos represents the range of the nonlocal interactions for this value of the reynolds number and it is responsible here for the so - called bottleneck effect ( cf .",
    ", for instance , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting that using the viscosity only ( as a rough approximation for the governing dimensional parameter ) in the asymptotic eq .",
    "( 9 ) one obtains an asymptotic estimate for @xmath57 .",
    "this value is only by @xmath58 smaller than the value @xmath59 obtained above with taking into account the nonlocal interactions at the asymptotic @xmath60 .",
    "+    naturally , one can expect that the same spectrum should be also valid for a passive scalar field in the isotropic homogeneous turbulence .",
