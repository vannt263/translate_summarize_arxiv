    "weak gravitational lensing is one of the most promising observational tools available to cosmologists for studying the recent accelerated expansion of the universe",
    ". images of distant galaxies appear distorted due to the bending of light as it passes through the gravitational potential of the intervening matter .",
    "the image distortion can be described as a shearing of the original galaxy shape .",
    "this `` cosmic shear '' can be exploited to study the matter distribution in the universe and the growth of structure .",
    "cosmic shear has the potential to be one of the most powerful probes both of dark matter and of dark energy  @xcite which together are thought to make up about @xmath1 of the energy budget of the universe  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for any individual galaxy",
    "it is impossible to separate the small cosmic shear distortion from the intrinsic ellipticity of the galaxy shape .",
    "however , the light from physically close galaxies will follow a similar trajectory to the observer , passing through spacetime curved by the same gravitational fields .",
    "therefore these galaxies will acquire the same cosmic shear distortion .",
    "if it is assumed that galaxy shape and orientation are randomly assigned across the sky then the cosmic shear signal can be retrieved by averaging the ellipticities of a number of galaxies close on the sky .    in practice",
    "this assumption of randomly distributed galaxy shapes is unrealistic .",
    "spatially localised galaxies are expected to have formed within the same large - scale gravitational field , which is likely to cause an alignment in their intrinsic ellipticities @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review . this intrinsic alignment ( ia )",
    "effect will appear as a systematic error in estimates of cosmological parameters extracted from cosmic shear data , unless accurately taken into account .",
    "two types of ia affect the measured cosmic shear signal . physically close",
    "galaxies form in the same large - scale gravitational potential so share a preferred ellipticity orientation .",
    "this is the intrinsic - intrinsic ( ii ) correlation .",
    "background galaxies will be lensed by foreground gravitational potentials which govern the orientation of foreground galaxies .",
    "this causes an anti - correlation between the foreground / background galaxies known as the gravitational - intrinsic ( gi ) correlation .    broadly , there are two approaches to dealing with ias .",
    "the first , known as `` nulling '' , places steps in the weak lensing pipeline which remove the ia signal . the effect of ii correlations can be removed by downweighting physically close galaxy pairs @xcite .",
    "the gi term is more problematic as it affects all pairs of galaxies which are not physically close . in principle",
    "a particular linear combination of tomographic shear power spectra can be used to remove the gi signal if the redshifts of the galaxies are known  @xcite .",
    "the other approach tries to model the ia signal we would expect for a particular survey .",
    "these ia contributions can then be incorporated into the predictions for the measured shear signal and any free parameters in the ia model can be varied and marginalised over @xcite .",
    "this is the approach we investigate . to carry this out",
    "it is necessary to make physically motivated models for ias . ignoring ias",
    "completely will bias estimates of cosmological parameters  @xcite .",
    "in addition , other cosmological data sets , such as galaxy surveys , can be used to gain empirical knowledge about the ia effect , as well as its variation with luminosity , colour and any other variables .",
    "some of the modelling approaches make simultaneous use of the galaxy shear - galaxy shear correlation function and the galaxy position - galaxy shear correlation function , as measured from the same imaging survey  @xcite . where `` shear '' has contributions from both gravitational and intrinsic shear .",
    "this was first identified as an important additional statistic for learning about galaxy formation by @xcite and was recently suggested as a powerful tool for removing ias by  @xcite , which was demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "cosmic shear was first detected observationally a decade ago  @xcite and the strength of the signal as a function of galaxy separation has since been measured by many teams , most recently by @xcite and  @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "a compilation of recent cosmic shear results including a homogeneous additional treatment of systematics was made public by  @xcite .",
    "the use of photometric redshift information is now starting to allow the signal to be evaluated as a function of galaxy redshift  @xcite . the cosmological constraints in these recent papers",
    "are calculated assuming there are no ias .",
    "however , if ias are non - negligible then ignoring them will lead to a bias on cosmological parameters . the bias in @xmath0 was estimated to be between 1 and 20 per cent for a cfhtls - like survey by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite obtained a similar result in an approximate fisher matrix prediction .",
    "@xcite showed that for future surveys the equation of state parameter @xmath2 may be biased by order unity if ias are significant and ignored .",
    "@xcite used combo-17 measurements of the ii signal from shear - shear correlations between galaxies close in redshift jointly with cosmic shear rcs and virmos - descart shear - shear correlation data to constrain a simple intrinsic alignment model amplitude simultaneously with cosmological parameters .",
    "they marginalised over possible amplitudes of the ii signal and found the fitted value of @xmath0 was reduced by 0.03 relative to the value found when intrinsic alignments were ignored .",
    "@xcite estimated the amplitude of the gi signal marginalised over a range of @xmath0 , @xmath3 values allowed by the cosmic shear data .",
    "they found it to be consistent with zero , and this conclusion held when various different scale ranges were used for each of the fits for cosmology or for the ia amplitude parameter .",
    "they concluded that they found no evidence for a non - zero gi signal .",
    "@xcite took significant steps to reduce the contamination of their cosmic shear constraints by ias by excluding the auto - correlations for the 5 narrowest redshift bins and excluding luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) from their analysis .",
    "they also showed results using only the autocorrelations , which were similar to those excluding the autocorrelations results , leading them to conclude that intrinsic alignments are not a significant contaminant .",
    "many current and future surveys are planned with cosmic shear as a major design driver , in particular from the ground the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) , the kilo - degree survey ( kids ) , the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) surveys , the dark energy survey ( des ) , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , and space missions euclid and the joint dark energy mission ( jdem ) .",
    "the majority of observational constraints on galaxy ias have been carried out at low redshift  @xcite but these have recently been extended towards the redshifts relevant to cosmic shear surveys  @xcite .",
    "these studies have used spectroscopic galaxy surveys to calculate the galaxy position - galaxy shear correlation function and/or the galaxy shear - galaxy shear correlation function .",
    "constraints calculated from these correlation functions have been fitted with simple models for ias using a fixed cosmological model .    in this paper",
    "we calculate constraints on cosmological parameters from cosmic shear data , taking into account the likely contamination from ias for a range of ia models .",
    "we simultaneously fit an ia model and cosmological parameters to ia correlation functions .",
    "we then perform a joint analysis of cosmic shear and ia data , varying both cosmology and parameters within the ia model .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section [ sec : csandia ] reviews the cosmic shear formalism and some basic models of ias ; section [ sec : shear_shear ] presents constraints from the shear - shear correlation data ; section [ sec : iaspluswgl ] introduces an ia parameterisation and constraints from shear - position data ; section [ sec : joint ] uses shear - shear and shear - position data to produce joint constraints on ia and cosmological parameters and we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .    throughout",
    "we assume a flat , @xmath4 cosmology .",
    "when we refer to fiducial values for cosmological parameters we set the present day amplitude of linear mass fluctuations @xmath5= 0.751 , the baryon density @xmath6= 0.05 , the matter density @xmath7= 0.3 , and the hubble parameter defined by @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 as @xmath10= 0.7 .",
    "we assume a harrison - zeldovich primordial power spectrum slope @xmath11 .",
    "in this section we review the cosmic shear formalism before describing the origin of ias and their effect on the measured cosmic shear signal .",
    "we then summarise three basic approaches to modelling ias , beginning with the linear alignment model , then its non - linear extension and finally the halo model of @xcite .",
    "cosmic shear probes the expansion history and the growth of structure in the universe using weak gravitational lensing .",
    "the effect is rather small @xmath12 for most galaxies especially when compared to the intrinsic ellipticity of a single galaxy @xmath13 .",
    "therefore it is necessary to average over many galaxies to detect a coherent signal .",
    "a convenient statistic is the fourier transform of the two - point shear correlation function ( @xmath14 ) between pairs of galaxies , the cosmic shear power spectrum @xmath15 .",
    "it is well approximated by projecting the three - dimensional matter power spectrum @xmath16 at a redshift corresponding to a line - of - sight comoving distance @xmath17 , weighted by the lensing kernel , @xmath18 @xmath19 where in a flat universe @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the scale factor , @xmath22 is the comoving distance to the hubble horizon , and the function @xmath23 is the selection function of source galaxies per unit comoving distance , normalized as @xmath24 .",
    "the two - point shear correlation function is determined by the cosmic shear power spectrum via @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the zeroth order bessel function of the first kind .",
    "if galaxies were randomly oriented on the sky then the cosmic shear signal would be relatively easy to observe because the random intrinsic contributions to the observed ellipticities would average away to zero .",
    "however this is not expected to be the case .",
    "galaxies form within large - scale gravitational potentials , producing some  intrinsic alignment \" between galaxy shear .",
    "there are two ways in which ias contribute to the observed shear power spectrum :    the ii correlation : intrinsic - intrinsic galaxy alignments occur because physically close galaxies form in the same tidal field , causing an alignment of their halos or angular momentum vectors . as a result the galaxies point in the same direction .",
    "this alignment produces an increase in the measured shear power spectrum .",
    "the gi correlation : gravitational - intrinsic alignments are a cross term between intrinsic ellipticity and cosmic shear . the intrinsic ellipticity of a galaxy is aligned with the density field in which it forms and this field in turn contributes to the lensing distortion of more distant galaxies . this double role causes an anti - correlation between galaxy ellipticities , because the closer galaxy may be expected to point towards the local overdensity while the distant galaxy is stretched tangentially around the overdensity .",
    "this leads to a suppression of the measured power spectrum .",
    "the measured shear power spectrum @xmath27 therefore arises from genuine cosmic shear , combined with ia terms produced by the ii and gi correlations @xmath28    the strength of the ii term depends strongly on the depth of the survey",
    ". a deep survey may contain galaxies at many different distances from the observer , so two galaxies which appear close on the sky are most likely to be far apart along the line of sight and therefore not physically close .",
    "since the opposite is true for a shallower survey then the ia is stronger .",
    "in addition the lensing strength is smaller when all distances are reduced , so the cosmic shear contribution is small for a shallow survey .",
    "the ii and gi lensing power spectra are calculated analogously to @xmath15 @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the intrinsic - intrinsic and gravitational - intrinsic power spectra respectively .    in this paper",
    "we illustrate the effect of ias on cosmological constraints using data from the 100 square degree weak lensing survey  @xcite .",
    "we compare constraints from four different approaches to ias :    1 .   ignoring ia effects 2 .   the linear alignment model of ias 3 .",
    "the non - linear alignment ( nla ) model of ias 4 .",
    "the halo model of ias .",
    "ias can be studied with probes other than the usual cosmic shear measurement of shear - shear correlation functions .",
    "section [ sec : iaspluswgl ] below we use data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) galaxy redshift survey shear - position correlation functions @xcite to constrain the amplitude , scale and luminosity dependence of ias .",
    "these results can be combined with models of ia in cosmic shear predictions to produce less biased constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "details of the ia parameterisations are given below .",
    "a popular simple method for modelling ias is known as the linear alignment ( la ) model because it assumes that the intrinsic ellipticity of galaxies is proportional to the curvature of the primordial large scale potential @xcite .",
    "this is thought to be most relevant for elliptical galaxies . in the linear alignment model the ii and gi power spectra",
    "are found to first order to be @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the linear theory matter power spectrum , @xmath37 is a normalization constant , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the growth factor normalized to unity at the present day , and @xmath40 is the mean matter density of the universe as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "this linear alignment model is likely to hold on large scales but it takes no account of non - linear growth of structure .",
    "one somewhat ad - hoc method that has been employed  @xcite to rectify this deficiency is to substitute the non - linear matter power spectrum @xmath41 , instead of the linear theory matter power spectrum @xmath36 , into eq .",
    "[ eq : p_ii ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : p_gi ] . in this work",
    "we use the @xcite prescription for the non - linear matter power spectrum .",
    "we call this approach the non - linear alignment ( nla ) model",
    ".      the halo model of galaxy clustering @xcite is a simple but effective predictor for galaxy clustering statistics .",
    "to first order in this model the universe consists of dark matter halos , distributed according to linear theory .",
    "each halo is described by a mass , drawn from a mass function , and a density profile .",
    "the forms of these functions are generally taken from averages of n - body simulations ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .    applying the halo model to ias",
    "provides a physically motivated way to model small - scale features of the ia signal .",
    "a simple example was provided in  @xcite which we describe and use here .",
    "each dark matter halo is taken to have a single central galaxy , positioned exactly at the centre of the spherical halo mass distribution .",
    "these central galaxies are assumed to have ellipticities determined by the large - scale density perturbations according to the linear alignment model .",
    "the satellite galaxy number density follows the density profile of the halo and their ellipticities are defined according to a distribution in the angle between the satellite major axis and the three - dimensional radius vector of the parent halo .",
    "shear two - point correlation functions then consist of two components : a  one - halo term \" arising from pairs of galaxies within the same halo , and a  two - halo term \" due to pairs in different halos .    for ias",
    "the one - halo term comes from the radial alignment of the satellite galaxies and the two - halo term is dominated by the correlation of the central galaxies in each halo . within this model one- and",
    "two - halo terms appear in both the ii and gi ia power spectra @xmath42 @xmath43    in the case of the ii power spectrum , the two - halo term can be further broken up into terms due to the correlation of satellites with satellites , satellites with centrals and centrals with centrals , and , in the gi case , the two - halo power spectrum can be separated into a central and a satellite term .",
    "however , it was found  @xcite that the two halo terms are dominated by the central with central ( ii ) and central ( gi ) terms , allowing us to ignore two - halo terms involving satellites .",
    "this greatly simplifies the equations , allowing us to write down the two - halo terms @xmath44 @xmath45 i.e. the ii and gi two - halo terms are just the same as the full linear alignment model of ias .",
    "@xcite provide fitting formulae for the one - halo power spectra @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the degree of alignment and determines the amplitude of the 1h power spectra , that could be set by comparison with simulations , and for the functions @xmath49 ( for @xmath50 = 1,2,3 ) we use the fitting formulae provided in  @xcite , that are based on a halo model with redshift dependence determined by the sheth - tormen  @xcite model for the halo mass function and bias as well as the linear growth function in their fiducial cosmology .",
    "the ia power spectra @xmath51 and @xmath52 enter both the shear - shear and shear - position calculations . in principle",
    "they depend on cosmology through the contents of the one- and two - halo terms , given in equations [ eq : pee2h ] to [ eq : pdgi1h ] .",
    "the two - halo term contains the linear theory matter power spectrum and the growth rate , both of which depend on the values of cosmological parameters .",
    "the one - halo term is derived from a consideration of the number halos as a function of halo mass , and a match to the redshift distribution of the survey in question .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the dependence on the survey redshift distribution is weak and thus we neglect it here .",
    "the dependence of both terms on cosmology could be included , and this would make sense if we had complete faith in the models .",
    "we have the alternative of considering the ia power spectra for our fiducial model as a template representing a reasonable but poorly understood guess at the contribution from ias . for",
    "this work we use the one - halo term as given in  @xcite and ignore any cosmology dependence within it .",
    "we choose to fix @xmath0 within the two - halo calculation to the fiducial value .",
    "therefore the relative amplitude of the one- and two - halo terms stay roughly constant and the overall amplitude of the sum is varied ( see below ) . in this paper",
    "we choose to vary the matter density inside the linear theory matter power spectra used in the two - halo terms in equations [ eq : pee2h ] and [ eq : pdgi2h ] and in the @xmath7 contribution to the normalised growth in the denominator of these equations .    to include the colour and luminosity dependence we generalise our halo model equations  [ eq : p_ii_halo ] and  [ eq : p_gi_halo ] @xmath53 ^ 2 \\label{eq : p_ii_halo_general } \\\\",

    "the factor in square brackets is squared in the first equation and not in the second equation , to mimic a simultaneous modulation of the one - halo scaling parameter @xmath54 and the two - halo amplitude parameter @xmath37 . throughout",
    "we retain the fiducial values of @xmath55 following  @xcite and @xmath56 following  @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 is the normalised luminosity of the data bin and @xmath58 is the fraction of red galaxies in the data bin .",
    "this power law in luminosity is equivalent to that used in the power law fits of  @xcite .",
    "the motivation for multiplication by the red fraction @xmath58 is that we assume only red galaxies have ias .",
    "these equations could be generalised to have different ia amplitudes for red and blue galaxies by adding a term proportional to the blue fraction @xmath59 with a different variable amplitude parameter",
    ". however , we defer such modelling to future work . a and @xmath60 are free parameters .",
    "note that the above equations reduce to the basic halo model for @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "in this section we summarise the cosmic shear data we use and compare it with predicted correlation functions with the various ia models .",
    "we then make a first calculation of the impact of the models on constraints on the amplitude of matter clustering and the matter density of the universe .      the dataset used to constrain models in this paper",
    "is the 100 square degree weak lensing survey @xcite .",
    "this combines data from the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls)-wide , the garching - bonn deep survey ( gabods ) , the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ) and the virmos - descart surveys .",
    "the cfhtls - wide data included in this compilation covers an area of 22 deg@xmath63 , reaching a depth of i = 24.5 @xcite .",
    "there is 13 deg@xmath63 of data from the gabods survey which uses objects which lie in the interval r @xmath64 [ 21.5,24.5 ] @xcite .",
    "the rcs data covers 53 deg@xmath63 with a limiting magnitude of 25.2 in the @xmath65 band @xcite .",
    "the virmos - descart data has an effective area of 8.5 deg@xmath63 and a limiting magnitude of @xmath66 @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the redshift distributions for each data set as given by eq .",
    "9 of  @xcite using the parameters given in the upper section of their table 2 for the high confidence regime ( fitted to photometric redshifts in the range @xmath67 from * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite took into account uncertainties in the photometric redshift distributions by sampling from tuples of these parameter values and selecting the best fit values for each of the three parameters . for computational practicality",
    "we here ignore uncertainties in the photometric redshift distributions .",
    "we therefore next describe in more detail the relative differences between the redshift distributions of the different surveys , ignoring the uncertainties .",
    "since the impact of ias on each dataset hinges so much on the redshift distribution we show the redshift distributions and the difference in distribution , with respect to cfhtls , for each dataset in fig .",
    "[ fig : n(z ) ] .",
    "we see that virmos - descart and gabods have the greatest number of low redshift galaxies and virmos - descart shows a signifigant excess at @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig : corrfns_100sqdeg ] shows the correlation functions of the four constituent surveys of the 100 deg@xmath63 dataset .",
    "we overlay the predicted correlation functions for each of the ia models we consider .",
    "the correlation functions are calculated for the fiducial cosmology , with no attempt to find the best fit to each survey .",
    "note that fig .",
    "1 in @xcite plots similar calculated correlation functions but uses a different , best - fit , @xmath5 for each survey .",
    "overall the gi contribution dominates the ia signal and has the effect of reducing the shear - shear correlation signal ; hence all the correlation functions which include an ia component are mostly lower than the equivalent correlation function without ias ( solid line ) .",
    "as expected , the halo model ( dashed line ) agrees with the la ( dotted line ) and nla ( dot - dashed line ) models at large angular separation where the two - halo term and linear theory dominate .",
    "the halo and la models diverge at small angular separation when the additional one - halo term becomes important and the shear - shear correlation amplitude is reduced due to the negative contributions from the gi term .",
    "the nla model is intermediate between the la and halo model at small angular separations .",
    "the increase in the halo model correlation function at intermediate scales is caused by an increased ii contribution on these scales . in the halo model of ias",
    "the galaxies align towards the center of dark matter halos , and as a result are also aligned with each other .",
    "therefore the one - halo term for the gi signal dominates on a scale corresponding to the typical distance of galaxies from the halo center , whereas the one - halo term for the ii signal occurs at the typical halo diameter .",
    "this explains why the gi term dominates at small scales and the ii term has a bigger impact at intermediate scales .",
    "we now compare the predicted correlation functions for the different surveys .",
    "the only difference between the predictions comes from the different redshift distributions used .",
    "the ia signals dominate over the cosmic shear signal at low redshift . a large number of physically close galaxies produces a large ii effect . surveys with a large number of low redshift galaxies will have a large proportion of these physically close strongly aligned galaxies .",
    "[ fig : n(z ) ] shows that virmos - descart ( dashed line ) and gabods ( dot - dashed line ) have the largest proportion of low redshift galaxies , so we expect the strong increase at intermediate scales in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrfns_100sqdeg ] .",
    "conversely cfhtls has the lowest proportion of low - z galaxies and we see little increase in its correlation function due to an ii contribution .",
    "we are interested in the biasing of cosmological constraints when ias are erroneously ignored .",
    "we compare predicted and observed correlation functions and produce @xmath69 values at a range of amplitudes of matter clustering , parameterised by @xmath0 .",
    "these are used to calculate a best fit @xmath0 and corresponding 68@xmath70 confidence limits .",
    "this was done for each of the four cosmic shear datasets separately and the analysis was repeated using the four different ia approaches . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma8 ] .",
    "the right - hand panel shows the 68@xmath70 confidence limits using the combined 100 deg@xmath63 data , obtained by multiplying together the probabilities @xmath71 from each survey . in this analysis ,",
    "all other cosmological parameters are held at their fiducial values and we fix @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in all analysis quoted in this paper , we kept @xmath0 constant , at its fiducial value , within the ia models themselves which can be scaled by an overall amplitude parameter @xmath75 .",
    "as usual , the cosmic shear correlation function has a strong dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the results show a dependence of the measured @xmath5 on the ia model . ignoring ias ( horizontal / vertical crosses )",
    "produces results which are consistently below the results when ias are taken into account , irrespective of the ia model used .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the correlation functions seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrfns_100sqdeg ] .",
    "the dominance of the gi term has the effect of lowering the overall shear - shear correlation function prediction meaning that constraints using an ia model favour a larger value of @xmath5 to compensate for the reduced amplitude .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for the nla model ( diagonal crosses ) than for the linear alignment model ( circles ) because suppression of the correlation function due to the gi term is stronger in the nla . when the halo model is used ( triangles )",
    "the best fit @xmath5 is larger than that when ias are ignored , but the difference can be smaller than for the nla or la models due to the contribution from the ii correlations at intermediate separations which partially cancel the gi terms .",
    "we note that the difference between the halo model constraint and that when ias are ignored is least for gabods and virmos - descart .",
    "this is consistent with their relatively large number of low - redshift galaxies .",
    "this produces an increased ii contribution at intermediate scales , lowering constrained @xmath5 values .",
    "the effect is biggest for virmos - descart because it has the greatest constraining power at these intermediate scales .",
    "although ias are an important cosmic shear systematic and a clear biasing is apparent , it is encouraging to note that the effect is not catastrophic : the best - fit values for almost all surveys and ia models lie within the 68@xmath70 confidence limits of the results in which ias are ignored . because the uncertainties on @xmath5 are smaller for the joint constraints ( right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma8 ] ) , the total biases are now similar to the 68 per cent confidence limits .",
    "we use a more sophisticated model for how ias affect cosmic shear constraints in section  [ sec : joint ] .",
    "we next calculate constraints from the cosmic shear data allowing both the fluctuation amplitude @xmath5 and the matter density @xmath7 to vary .",
    "other cosmological parameters are held at their fiducial values .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cls_s8odm ] as 68@xmath70 confidence contours in @xmath5-@xmath7 parameter space .",
    "all results for the various ia models show the usual cosmic shear degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath7 . as expected , at a fixed @xmath76 we can read off the @xmath0 constraints shown in the previous figure .",
    "however the relative pattern between models depends on the assumed value of @xmath7 and furthermore different @xmath7 ranges are preferred by different models .",
    "the most interesting result is that from the halo model of ias ( light solid ( green ) contour ) , which favours the high @xmath5 and low @xmath7 end of the degeneracy . very roughly speaking",
    "the shear - shear correlation function data provide two pieces of information : an amplitude and a slope .",
    "the amplitude constrains a degenerate combination of @xmath0 and @xmath7 but the slope of the correlation function partly breaks this degeneracy and determines the preferred range range of @xmath7 along the degeneracy line .",
    "the most constraining data set is cfhtls , that has tightest constraints on large scales .",
    "the effect of the halo model of ias is to steepen the correlation function on these scales due to the contribution from the ii one - halo term at intermediate scales ( note that this one - halo ii term does not vary with cosmological parameters in our implementation so this conclusion stands at all positions in cosmological parameter space . )",
    "an increase in @xmath7 flattens the matter power spectrum on the scales of interest , thereby increasing the amount of power on small scales relative to large scales .",
    "this means that an increase in @xmath7 leads to a more steeply decreasing correlation function .",
    "thus to reproduce the observed data in the presence of ia halo model contributions @xmath7 must decrease , leading to the position of the halo model contours .",
    "in this section we introduce a new data set which was produced with the aim of measuring the ia signal .",
    "we use the galaxy shear - galaxy position two - point function that quantifies whether the shape of one galaxy points at the position of another galaxy .",
    "if we have a good understanding of how the galaxy positions are related to the mass distribution then this effectively constrains the ia power spectrum @xmath77 .",
    "we compute predictions for the two point function using the halo model for ias , then compare it to the data to measure ia model parameters .",
    "we use data measured from the sdss galaxy survey , a 5-band ( ugriz ) photometric survey over  @xmath78 steradians of the sky , with spectroscopic follow - up of @xmath79 objects @xcite .",

    "in this paper we use three physically motivated ia models , of increasing complexity , to demonstrate how constraints on the amplitude of fluctuations @xmath0 and matter density @xmath7 are changed depending on the assumptions about ias .",
    "the size of the change in @xmath0 depends on the redshift distribution of galaxies in the shear - shear survey and on the range of scales probed . in particular",
    "this affects the interplay between the two different types of ia ( ii and gi ) which have competing effects on cosmological constraints . a simple examination of ias which assumes all galaxies are like the sdss main red l4 sample suggests that @xmath0 has previously been underestimated by about one standard deviation .",
    "the underestimate appears to be larger using the non - linear matter power spectrum in the linear alignment model for ias than when using the linear matter power spectrum . on using the halo model for ias",
    "the bias depends significantly on the range of scales probed by the survey due to the larger effect of ii at intermediate scales which biases the measured @xmath0 downwards when taken into account .",
    "we have performed the first constraints on multiple ia model parameters from observed shear - position correlation functions using a physically motivated model for ias .",
    "we also show the first simultaneous constraints on ia and cosmological parameters from either shear - position or shear - shear correlation functions .",
    "as expected , the majority of the constraint on cosmology comes from the shear - shear correlation functions , and the majority of the constraint on ias comes from the shear - position correlation functions .",
    "we have used a motivated model for luminosity and colour evolution of shear - shear galaxy samples as a function of redshift to improve our constraints on cosmology from shear - shear correlation data in the presence of the halo model for ias . in general",
    "this reduces the overall effect of ias on cosmology , which we attribute to the decreased contribution from ia at low redshifts .",
    "we consider constraints on the amplitude of fluctutions @xmath0 from shear - shear data alone with fixed ia amplitude and luminosity dependence parameters , and compare this with constraints after marginalising over these parameters .",
    "as expected the constraints are weaker after marginalisation , but are not biased significantly .",
    "this is due to the relatively flat degeneracy between @xmath0 and the ia amplitude arising from the competing effects of gi and ii terms , and the ability of shear - shear information alone to place some constraint on the ia amplitude if other cosmological parameters are held fixed .",
    "the model we used for the luminosity and colour evolution of the shear - shear galaxy sample could be improved in its complexity , for example by allowing a population of faint blue galaxies at high redshift .",
    "furthermore we assumed the shear - shear galaxy sample had a single luminosity and colour at each redshift , whereas a more sophisticated analysis would integrate over ranges in each .",
    "a joint analysis of shear - shear and shear - position correlation functions has been discussed as a promising tool for removing ias from future cosmic shear datasets  @xcite .",
    "we perform the first joint analysis of these correlation functions on observational data . the uncertainties on the amplitude of fluctuations @xmath0 are now reduced to the size found when",
    "ias are ignored .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath0 is either decreased or increased relative to the case where ias are ignored .",
    "however , for the combined constraints from the  @xcite shear - shear data compliation the overall @xmath0 value is barely changed on performing the full joint analysis of shear - shear and shear - position correlation functions with ias , relative to the conventional analysis in which ias are ignored and only shear - shear information is used .    the constraints in the two - dimensional parameter space of @xmath0 and @xmath7 show a bigger change , that we have attributed to the slope of the shear - position correlation function preferring higher @xmath7 values .",
    "this raises the question of how to incorporate cosmological parameters into ia predictions .",
    "for example we could have considered the ia power spectra from our fiducial cosmological model as template functions which are allowed to vary only in amplitude .",
    "it also places a new burden of accuracy on measurements of the shear - position correlation function , that in turn depend on measurements of galaxy biasing for their interpretation .",
    "we have not repeated the full analysis of @xcite , who consider several other potential sources of systematic uncertainty including photometric redshift and shear calibration errors .",
    "we defer this to future investigations that could incorporate the very latest cosmic shear data .",
    "the recent re - analysis of the cosmos cosmic shear data  @xcite by @xcite investigates a number of potential cosmic shear systematics including ias .",
    "the photometric redshifts are used to produce the first cosmic shear tomographic cross - correlation functions which allow a much better control of ias .",
    "furthermore they investigate the effect of removing red galaxies from the cosmic shear sample which should help to reduce the effect of ias further .",
    "this would have to be carefully modelled in the predictions of the ia contribution to the shear - shear correlation functions .",
    "we believe that future cosmic shear analyses should include a model for ias and use the existing galaxy survey data to help constrain this simultaneously with cosmology , as set out in this paper .",
    "the modelling in this paper could be improved by extending the flexibility in the ia model , for example by allowing the one- and two - halo terms to vary independently in amplitude , and allowing an unknown amplitude for the ias for blue galaxies .",
    "furthermore the amplitude parameters could be free functions of redshift and even scale .",
    "the ia models we have used specify simultaneously the two types of ia , ii and gi . however , a more general model of ias can lead to independent uncertainties in each of the source terms of these effects  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the bias and correlation terms of the intrinsic convergence with the lensing potential in ) .",
    "however , if such a large degree of flexibility were allowed with current shear - position information then the constraining power of current cosmic shear data would be significantly reduced .",
    "therefore it is important to obtain better measurements of the shear - position correlation functions , and/or improve models of ias to reduce the number of free parameters . in this analysis",
    "we have used measurements of the galaxy shear - position correlation function made from a spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey .",
    "it should be possible to make these measurements from the same data used for the cosmic shear survey itself , however this has not yet been done .",
    "this will require a careful understanding of the survey mask as well as a measurement of the galaxy biasing to allow the shear - position correlation function to be related to the shear - density correlation function .",
    "in addition there are constraints in the literature from the shear - shear correlation functions of low redshift galaxy samples as well as for higher redshift spectroscopic galaxy samples which can be used to provide further constraints on the ia contributions .",
