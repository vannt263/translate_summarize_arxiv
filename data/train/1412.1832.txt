    "recent studies of stellar populations in globular clusters ( gcs ) are facing a new paradigm as more and more gcs are observed to have multiple populations .",
    "photometric observations discovered , for many gcs , splits from main sequence ( ms ) to red giant branch ( rgb ) on the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these observations are generally interpreted to be due to the differences in light / heavy elements and/or helium abundances between the subpopulations in these gcs @xcite .",
    "high and medium resolution spectroscopic observations have also established that abundance variations in light elements ( c , n , o , na , mg and al ) are common in most gcs ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . furthermore , star - to - star variations in heavy elements abundance are discovered in some massive gcs , such as @xmath2  centauri , m2 , m22 , m54 , ngc 1851 , and ngc 2419 @xcite .",
    "abundance variations in light elements are suggested to be due to the chemical pollutions and/or enrichments by intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( imagb ) stars @xcite , rotating agb stars @xcite , and fast - rotating massive stars ( frmss ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , heavy element abundance variations would imply that a later generation of stars was enriched by type ii supernovae ( sne ; @xcite ) .",
    "this in turn indicates that the gcs were once massive enough to retain sne ejecta , and may even be the remnant cores of dwarf galaxies .",
    "therefore , searches for these gcs are important as they can provide additional evidence for the galaxy building blocks predicted in the @xmath3cdm hierarchical merging paradigm .    in this respect ,",
    "the narrow - band ca photometry , which measures the strength of calcium ii h & k lines @xcite , can be a powerful probe as it can detect even a small spread in calcium abundance .",
    "indeed , recent ca photometry performed at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) has successfully detected splits on the rgb in several gcs , including m22 , ngc 1851 , and ngc 288 @xcite .",
    "the caveat in such a narrow - band study , however , is that the adjacent cn lines at 3883  can contaminate the measurement if the filter transmission function intrudes into the cn band .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite reported that this is the case in the ca filter used by previous investigators at ctio .",
    "therefore , new photometry employing a new ca filter , which is carefully designed to avoid this cn contamination , together with follow - up multi - object spectroscopy , are needed to confirm the origin of the split discovered from previous photometric studies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to confirm the presence and origin of multiple rgbs in m22 , ngc 1851 , and ngc 288 from the new ca photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy . as a comparison ,",
    "we have also observed ngc 6397 , which shows only a single narrow rgb @xcite .",
    "the original ca filter , as defined by @xcite , was centered at 3995  to include calcium ii h & k lines with a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of approximately 90  .",
    "its lower limit was designed to avoid contamination by the cn band at 3883  . in practice , however , the response function of ca filter might be deteriorated as a result of ageing .",
    "recently , upon our request , new measurement for the response function of the `` old '' ca filter available at ctio was made by c. johnson , d. hlck , & a. kunder ( 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "as briefly reported in @xcite and @xcite , it shows that the response function is shifted to short wavelength by @xmath475  compared to that known to the community .",
    "the origin of this deterioration is not clear , but this underscores the importance of routine inspection of the response function when narrow - band filters are used .",
    "therefore , we have carefully designed and manufactured a `` new '' ca filter to avoid the cn contamination .",
    "the blue end of the new filter is shifted to the longer wavelength and has a narrower fwhm ( 84  ) with steeper blue and red wings than those of the old ca filter ( see figure  [ fig_cafilters ] ) . therefore , while the old ca filter ( hereafter ca+cn filter ) available at ctio was measuring not only calcium ii h & k lines but also cn band , the new ca filter ( hereafter ca filter ) is practically measuring only calcium lines .",
    "our photometry with the new ca filter on the du pont 2.5 m telescope at las campanas observatory ( lco ) was made during the nights from 2011 to 2013 .",
    "the direct ccd equipped on this telescope provides a field of view ( fov ) of 8.85 @xmath5 8.85 and a pixel scale of 0.259 . in order to compare with the data obtained from new ca filter",
    ", we have also reduced the ca+cn filter data from the ctio 4 m telescope .",
    "this photometry employed the same ca+cn filter originally used by @xcite in their pioneering study .",

    "all data were then reduced using daophot ii / allstar and allframe @xcite .",
    "standard stars in m22 , ngc 3680 , and ngc 5822 @xcite were observed to calibrate instrumental magnitudes to the standard system .",
    "the astrometric solutions were derived from the reference stars in the usno - b1 and 2mass all - sky point source catalogs by running tasks in the iraf finder package .",

    "this result , based on a lager sample , therefore confirms the presence of cn bimodality reported earlier in this cluster @xcite .              since the early detection of cn - strong stars in ngc 1851 @xcite , recent spectroscopic observations found abundance variations in many light elements from ms to rgb stars in this gc @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite detected the spread in [ fe / h ] among rgb stars .",
    "several photometric observations , including our ca photometry reported in section  [ sec_photometry ] , also show a clear split in rgb @xcite . in order to understand the origin of this split",
    ", we have again compared spectral indices between the two subpopulations .",
    "figure  [ fig_n1851spec ] shows distributions of measured spectral indices for stars on the two rgbs in ngc 1851 . similar to the case of m22 , these stars are separated in both @xmath26hk@xmath1 and @xmath26cn indices .",
    "the difference between the two subpopulations in @xmath26hk@xmath1 index is 0.035 and that in @xmath26cn index is 0.42 , which are significant at 4.6@xmath0 and 12.8@xmath0 levels , respectively .",
    "we also estimated the difference in [ fe / h ] , @xmath40.14 dex , from the difference in @xmath26hk@xmath1 index , which is somewhat larger than the difference obtained from high - resolution spectroscopy ( 0.06 @xmath4 0.08 dex ; @xcite ) .",
    "our results for this gc suggest that stars on the two distinct rgbs , divided in both the @xmath17 color and the @xmath8 index , indeed have different calcium abundances .",
    "the rgb split in the @xmath17 color is most likely affected by the difference in cn band strength as the wide passband of the @xmath16 filter includes this molecular band , while the split in the @xmath8 index is originated from the difference in calcium abundance .",
    "in addition , figure  [ fig_n1851hist ] shows the histogram for @xmath26cn index , which suggests that rgb stars in ngc 1851 would be divided into three subpopulations .",
    "this is mainly because the bluer rgb stars in our ca photometry are further divided into two subpopulations .",
    "this trimodal distribution is comparable with the result by @xcite .",
    "the presence of three subpopulations , instead of two , in massive gcs is also suggested from the recent population models @xcite , and the observed na - o anti - correlation @xcite .",
    "as described in section  [ sec_photometry ] , the rgb split in ngc 288 , discovered from the old ca photometry @xcite , is not confirmed from the new ca photometry reported in this study .",
    "figure  [ fig_n288spec ] shows a very clear separation in @xmath26cn index among rgb stars in this gc , while this is not shown in the @xmath26hk@xmath1 index .",
    "the difference in @xmath26cn index between the two subpopulations is 0.31 , which is significant at 16.6@xmath0 level .",
    "this result is comparable to the spread in @xmath26cn reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mean @xmath26hk@xmath1 indices of the two subpopulations , however , are almost identical well within the standard error , suggesting that the difference in @xmath26hk@xmath1 index is negligible .",
    "this is consistent with the recent result from high - resolution spectroscopy report by @xcite .",
    "therefore , unlike m22 and ngc 1851 , it appears that there is no evidence for the difference in calcium abundance in this gc .",
    "this result , together with our new ca photometry , indicates that the origin of the rgb split reported in old photometry was solely due to the effect of cn band . at the same time , in other respects ,",
    "this also verifies that our new photometry is not contaminated by cn band .    for ngc 6397 , which has only single rgb , and therefore stellar population",
    "is expected to be more homogeneous , our sample stars indeed show single and narrow distributions in all spectral indices ( see figure  [ fig_n6397spec ] ) .",
    "the standard deviation of the distribution in @xmath26hk@xmath1 is 0.023 , which is similar to that for ngc 288 but smaller than those for m22 and ngc 1851 ( @xmath40.04 ) . in the case of @xmath26cn index ,",
    "standard deviation for this gc ( @xmath40.062 ) is also much smaller than those for other gcs ( @xmath40.18 ) .",
    "the cn - ch anti - correlation is one of the most well - known features in gc spectroscopic studies .",
    "this feature was reported for many gcs , including m2 , m3 , m5 , m13 , m71 , ngc 5927 , ngc 6352 , ngc 6752 , pal 12 , and 47 tuc ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since cn band strength is mostly affected by nitrogen abundance while ch band is a measure of carbon abundance , the cn - ch anti - correlation would indicate that nitrogen abundance is inversely correlated with carbon abundance @xcite .",
    "this chemical disproportion is generally interpreted as a result of evolution mixing @xcite or self - enrichment @xcite .",
    "while the evolution mixing contributes to the presence of cn - ch anti - correltaion in rgb stars , recent studies favored the self - enrichment scenario over evolution mixing , because this feature is observed even from the un - evolved stage , ms and sgb @xcite , which suggests a primordial difference in chemical composition .",
    "also , the presence of distinct separation between the two groups would be hardly reproduced by the evolution scenario , as this mechanism is more likely to produce just the spread rather than the discrete distribution .    in order to investigate the correlation between cn and ch band strengths in our sample gcs , in figure  [ fig_cn_ch ] , we plot @xmath26cn versus @xmath26ch of rgb stars in ngc 288 , ngc 1851 , and m22 , respectively . in the case of ngc 288",
    ", we can see the anti - correlation between cn and ch ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is consistent with the general trend reported in previous studies .",
    "ngc 1851 , however , shows no apparent relation between cn and ch indices , mostly because the difference in @xmath26ch index is negligible between the two subpopulations .",
    "this result is consistent with earlier findings from ms and sgb stars in this gc @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", m22 apparently shows a positive correlation between cn and ch .",
    "the correlation similar to this was reported by @xcite and @xcite from their sample of rgb stars .",
    "this was not detected , however , by @xcite and @xcite from their sample of ms and sgb stars , although the insufficient s / n ratio and the effect of differential reddening have prevented them to reach a firm conclusion .",
    "careful examination of the redder rgb subpopulation ( red circle ) in figure  [ fig_cn_ch ] indicates , however , a sign of anti - correlation between cn and ch .",
    "this suggests that the apparent correlation has probably arisen because of the mixture of the two distinct subpopulations having different metal abundance ( see below ) , each of which has cn - ch anti - correlation .",
    "note also that gcs without cn - ch anti - correlation ( ngc 1851 and m22 ) are those with calcium abundance variations .",
    "this also suggests that the absence of cn - ch anti - correlation is probably due to the effect of sne enrichment , because only this mechanism can increase overall metallicity , including c , n , and heavy elements .",
    "we have shown that rgb stars in m22 and ngc 1851 are clearly split into two subpopulations in the narrow - band photometry employing the new ca filter , while this is not observed in ngc 288 . from the low - resolution spectroscopy , we have confirmed that these splits in m22 and ngc 1851 are indeed originated from the difference in calcium abundance .",
    "this confirms that a part of the rgb split reported by @xcite was due to the difference in calcium abundance . in the case of cn band strength ,",
    "the strong differences between the two subpopulations are found in all three gcs from our spectroscopy .",
    "in addition , we found a systematic difference in the cn - ch correlation among these gcs .",
    "while the well - known cn - ch anti - correlation is confirmed in ngc 288 , rgb stars in ngc 1851 show no correlation between cn and ch . for m22 ,",
    "the trend becomes reversed and we found a positive correlation between the two bands .",
    "this systematic difference among three gcs is mainly due to the difference in the strength of ch band .",
    "the origin of the presence of the two distinct subpopulations with different heavy element abundance in some gcs is not yet fully understood .",
    "two scenarios are suggested in the literature , all of which are apparently possible only in dwarf galaxy environment .",
    "one is that the later generation stars in these gcs were formed in the metal enriched gas from the earlier generations ( hereafter self - enrichment scenario ; @xcite , see also @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the other is that these gcs formed through the merging of two proto - galactic gcs with slightly different metallicity ( hereafter merger scenario ; @xcite ) .",
    "the redder rgb stars in m22 and ngc 1851 are enhanced both in heavy and light elements . in the self - enrichment scenario",
    ", this would suggest that the redder rgb stars were affected by sne enrichment , together with the contamination from imagb stars , frmss , or rotating agb stars @xcite .",
    "the positive cn - ch correlation observed in m22 is also naturally explained in this scenario as the sne enrichment would have increased both nitrogen and carbon abundances . in the case of ngc 1851 ,",
    "the absence of cn - ch correlation is most likely because the enhancement in carbon abundance by sne was not enough to overcome the depletion of the same element by imagb stars or frmss . in this scenario ,",
    "ngc 288 was not affected by sne , but carbon was only depleted by imagb or frms .",
    "this suggests that the systematic difference in cn and ch correlation among three gcs is caused by how strongly sne enrichment has contributed to the chemical enrichment in gcs .",
    "the origin of this difference probably has something to do with the difference in the initial mass of the system as more enriched gas from sne would be retained in more massive gcs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the case of the merger scenario ,",
    "the presence of two subpopulations differing in both heavy and light elements abundances can be intuitively explained by simple merging of two gcs in the proto - dwarf galaxy environment @xcite .",
    "more metal - rich gcs are , in general , also observed to be enriched in light elements ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this would also explain the cn - ch correlation in m22 .",
    "the multimodal cn distribution in ngc 1851 was interpreted as an evidence of merger scenario as well @xcite .    the na - o anti - correlation among rgb stars , which is well established in most gcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , can provide a further constraint on these scenarios . according to these observations ,",
    "the regime occupied by stars on the na - o plane varies with the metallicity of gc .",
    "therefore , stars in the gcs having similar metallicity are distributed in the similar regime on the na - o plane . in the merger scenario , since the difference in metallicity between the two subpopulations is small in m22 and ngc 1851 , we would expect almost the same distribution on the na - o plane . in the self - enrichment scenario , on the other hand",
    ", the metal rich subpopulation would be placed in the na rich regime on the na - o plane , because the metal enriched gas used in the formation of the metal rich later generation stars would have also contaminated by agb and/or frms .",
    "figure  [ fig_nao ] shows the na - o anti - correlations for the rgb stars in two subpopulations in m22 and ngc 1851 , where the spectroscopic data were adopted from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "the case of `` normal '' gcs enriched by agb / frms , but not by sne , is illustrated by ngc 288 ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig_nao ] ; data from @xcite ) , where the second generation stars are clearly different from the first generation stars in that they are enhanced in [ na / fe ] but depleted in [ o / fe ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig_nao ] , the metal rich rgb stars in ngc 1851",
    "are preferentially placed in the na rich regime ( see * ? ? ? * for a similar result ) .",
    "the na abundance of the metal rich group ( red triangles ) is enhanced by 0.27 dex in [ na / fe ] compared to the metal poor group , which is significant at 13.0@xmath0 level . for m22 ( top panel )",
    ", however , the metal poor ( blue squares ) and the metal rich ( red triangles ) rgb stars show similar distributions on the na - o plane ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the difference in [ na / fe ] between the two groups is 0.19 dex , which is significant only at 1.6@xmath0 level .",
    "the significant difference in [ na / fe ] between the two subpopulations in ngc 1851 would prefer the self - enrichment scenario over the merger origin .",
    "however , for m22 , the sample size is too small to reach a firm conclusion from this data set , and therefore , further observations for a larger sample of rgb stars are required .",
    "we will continue our search for gcs originated from dwarf galaxies like @xmath2  cen , m22 and ngc 1851 .",
    "most of these galaxy building block candidates are expected to be present near the galactic bulge like ngc 6388 and terzan 5 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , where the reddening and field star contaminations are severe . in order to overcome these obstacles",
    ", we are currently performing both narrow - band ca photometry and low - resolution multi - object spectroscopy for these gcs . as will be demonstrated in our forthcoming paper , combining these two modes of observation",
    "makes it possible to effectively disentangle the effects from differential reddening and metallicity .",

    "<S> the calcium abundances of rgb stars in this gc are identical to within the errors . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the conclusion from our new ca photometry , where the rgb splits are confirmed in m22 and ngc 1851 , but not in ngc 288 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find interesting differences in cn - ch correlations among these gcs . </S>",
    "<S> while cn and ch are anti - correlated in ngc 288 , they show positive correlation in m22 . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 1851 , however , shows no difference in ch between the two groups of stars with different cn strengths . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that all of these systematic differences would be best explained by how strongly type ii supernovae enrichment has contributed to the chemical evolution of these gcs . </S>"
