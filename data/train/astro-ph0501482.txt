    "beginning february 1999 we used the arecibo telescope to begin a series of zeeman - splitting measurements of the 21-cm line in absorption against continuum radio sources .",
    "heiles & troland ( 2004 ; paper iii and references therein ) discussed technical details of the observing technique and data reduction and presented observational results , including magnetic field measurements .",
    "as described in paper iii , our analysis of the data identified gaussian components in the hi absorption spectra .",
    "we assume that each component samples a single , isothermal , sheet - like region of cnm . for 69 such components , we are able to estimate ( 1 ) the line - of - sight magnetic field strength @xmath7 , often subject to significant error , ( 2 ) the line - of - sight column density @xmath8 , and ( 3 ) the contribution of turbulence @xmath9 to the line - of - sight velocity dispersion .",
    "systematic instrumental errors are small and the uncertainties are gaussian distributed . therefore ,",
    "our survey has yielded a statistically well - defined ensemble of observed values for each of these three cnm quantities .    from these data ,",
    "we seek to answer several astrophysically significant questions .",
    "for example , what are the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of magnetic field strengths , column densities and turbulent energies in the cnm ?",
    "are any of these quantities statistically related to each other ?",
    "if so , can we determine if the magnetic field lies preferentially in the planes of cnm sheets or perpendicular to them ?",
    "what is the ratio of magnetic to turbulent energy in the cnm ?",
    "as we will see below , the data provide answers to some , but not all , of these questions .",
    "we observe quantities that are only indirectly related to the intrinsic astronomical ones .",
    "for the magnetic field , we observe the line of sight component @xmath7 , not the total field @xmath10 . for the column density @xmath11 ,",
    "we must account for the fact that the cold neutral medium is in sheets , not spheres ; our observed column densities @xmath12 are always larger than the intrinsic column density normal to the sheet @xmath13 .",
    "to properly interpret our results and to address the questions listed above , we must consider how the intrinsic and observed quantities are related in a statistical sample .",
    "these statistical transformations , and the results of applying them to our data , are the focus of the current paper .",
    "we treat both univariate distributions and bivariate distributions .",
    "the univariate distributions are most interesting because we obtain definitive results ; in contrast , the possible correlations that could be revealed by bivariate distributions are obscured by noise and inadequate numbers of data .",
    "accordingly , the reader who is interested in astrophysical results can concentrate on the sections dealing with univariate distributions of magnetic field , column density , and turbulent velocity .",
    "we recommend beginning with  [ important ] , which introduces the notation and concepts of intrinsic and observed quantities .",
    "we develop the theoretical relationships between observed and intrinsic univariate distributions in ",
    "[ thconv0 ] , and use these to obtain the actual intrinsic univariate distributions in  [ thconvuni ] .",
    "finally , we discuss astrophysical implications in  [ magdiscussion ] ,  [ ndiscussion ] ,  [ vdiscussion ] , and  [ finalcomments ] .",
    "we need to introduce important distinguishing nomenclature because of the anisotropic nature of magnetic - field - related quantities .",
    "first , we make the crucial distinction between _ line - of - sight _ ( @xmath14 ) quantities , such as @xmath7 , and the _ intrinsic astronomical _ ones such as @xmath0 .",
    "we will often refer to the latter with one the shorter terms `` intrinsic '' or `` astronomical '' .",
    "the important point is to distinguish between observed and intrinsic quantities .",
    "the line - of - sight component is the quantity to which the telescope responds , and we designate these with the subscript @xmath14 .",
    "there is an additional complication for the magnetic field , which is the presence of significant instrumental noise .",
    "thus , we must distinguish between the line - of - sight component of the field , designated by @xmath15 , and the actual measured value , designated by @xmath16 .",
    "we define    @xmath17    @xmath18    the essential difference between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the uncertainty contributed by random measurement noise .",
    "noise is small enough to neglect for column density and velocity , so the observed quantities are essentially identical to the @xmath14 ones ; we will use the subscript @xmath14 for the observed quantities , with the implicit assumption that their uncertainties from noise are negligible . for column density",
    ", we always refer to hi so we often write @xmath21 instead of @xmath11 .",
    "we usually consider sheets , for which the column density perpendicular to the face is @xmath22 and for which the apparent column density along the line of sight is    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the angle between the sheet s normal vector and the line of sight .",
    "similarly , for velocity linewidths , we use the symbol @xmath9 to indicate the line - of - sight component of the turbulent velocity .    finally , the probability density functions ( pdf ) of intrinsic quantities , such as @xmath0 , differ from those of the line - of - sight quantities",
    ". we will always use the symbol @xmath25 for the pdfs of intrinsic quantities , and the symbol @xmath26 for line - of - sight ( @xmath14 ) or the observed ones . unless otherwise specified , units are always as follows : magnetic field @xmath27 in @xmath2gauss ; column density @xmath21 in hi atoms @xmath28 @xmath6 ; velocity @xmath29 in km s@xmath30 .",
    "we begin with some light theory by considering elementary transformations of magnetic field and column density in statistical distributions .",
    "first , we consider how the intrinsic probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath10 , defined as @xmath31 , converts to the observed histogram or pdf of observed @xmath7 , defined as @xmath32 , under the assumption that fields are randomly oriented with respect to the observer .",
    "note the important distinction : @xmath10 is the total field strength ; @xmath7 is the observed line - of - sight component , which is always smaller .",
    "next we incorporate one of the fundamental results of heiles & troland ( 2003 ; paper ii ) , namely that the cnm components are thin sheets .",
    "we define @xmath33 as the hi column density perpendicular to the sheet ; the observed quantity is @xmath34 , which is always larger . as with the magnetic field , we consider how the pdf @xmath35 converts to the observed histogram or pdf @xmath36 , again under the assumption that the sheets are randomly oriented with respect to the observer .",
    "we also consider the statistical transformation of the distribution of the actual nonthermal velocity dispersion @xmath37 to that of the observed one @xmath38 under the assumption that turbulence is perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "we then tackle the bivariate distributions .",
    "first we consider how the bivariate distribution @xmath39 converts to the observed one @xmath40 .",
    "we then assume two extreme models , one with the fields always perpendicular to the sheets and one with fields parallel to the sheets , and assuming random orientations derive the observed bivariate distributions @xmath40 for the two cases .",
    "we illustrate and discuss the result by considering delta - function distributions of @xmath10 and @xmath13 , and we also apply the transformation of the observed @xmath40 to its intrinsic counterpart @xmath41 .",
    "finally , we examine the bivariate distributions involving the pairs @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which produces little in the way of useful results .",
    "we first consider the simple case in which all clouds have the same @xmath10 , which is randomly oriented with respect to the observer .",
    "the line of sight component @xmath7 is    @xmath44    where @xmath24 is the angle between the field direction and the line of sight .",
    "@xmath24 can run from 0 to @xmath45 , but the intervals from 0 to @xmath46 and @xmath46 to @xmath45 are identical except for a change of sign in @xmath7 .",
    "it s simpler and no less general to consider the smaller interval @xmath24 from 0 to @xmath46 so that we can ignore the slight complications of the sign change . in this case",
    ", the pdf of @xmath24 is the familiar    @xmath47    and we wish to know the pdf of @xmath7 , which is given by ( see trumpler and weaver 1953 for a discussion of these conversions )    @xmath48 \\left|       { d[\\theta({b_{los } } ) ] \\over d{b_{los } } } \\right|   \\ , \\ ] ]    which gives    @xmath49    in other words , @xmath7 is uniformly distributed between the maximum possible extremes 0 and @xmath10 ( actually @xmath50 ) .",
    "this leads to the well - known results that in a large statistical sample for which a constant @xmath0 is viewed at random angles , both the median and the mean observed field strengths are half the total field strength and that @xmath51 .",
    "more generally , observed fields are always smaller than the actual total fields , and with significant probability they range all the way down to zero .",
    "now suppose @xmath10 has an arbitrary pdf @xmath31 .",
    "the univariate pdf @xmath52 becomes the bivariate pdf @xmath53 , and we assume @xmath10 is independent of the observer s location so that @xmath54",
    ". note that we introduce subscripts on the different @xmath25 s to distinguish them , instead of designating them with different greek letters . to obtain @xmath32",
    "we again follow the standard techniques ; it s easy to integrate over @xmath24 and obtain    @xmath55}^\\infty { \\phi({b_{tot } } )       \\over { b_{tot } } } d{b_{tot}}\\ , \\ ] ]    where the symbol @xmath56 $ ] means the larger of the two quantities .",
    "the presence of @xmath10 in the denominator means that smaller ranges of @xmath7 are emphasized .",
    "this is commensurate with the equation [ bobs ] s uniform pdf for a single field value .",
    "we note that this can be regarded as an integral equation for @xmath31 and it is straightforward to invert .     for four representative functional forms .",

    "the vertical scales are arbitrary .",
    "[ pdf_fig0 ] , width=288 ]    figure [ pdf_fig0 ] illustrates the solution of equation [ bpsiphi ] for four functional forms of @xmath58 plotted against @xmath59 , where the subscript @xmath60 denotes the median value .",
    "these forms include the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath25 a kronecker delta function ( delta fcn ) , @xmath61 , yielding @xmath26 a flat function ( as discussed immediately above , equation [ bobs ] ) ; 2 .",
    "@xmath25 a flat distribution ( flat fcn ) between @xmath62 , yielding @xmath63 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath25 a weighted gaussian ( exp fcn ) , + @xmath64 + yielding @xmath26 a gaussian with dispersion @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath25 a gaussian ( gauss fcn ) with dispersion @xmath65 , yielding @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the exponential integral of order 1 .",
    "all four @xmath58 are plotted with respect to @xmath68 , so the medians of all lie at unity on the @xmath69-axis .",
    "however , the means differ .",
    "similarly , the medians and means of the associated @xmath57 differ from each other .",
    "these relationships between median and mean are summarized in table [ medianmean ] .",
    "the medians and means for @xmath57 are all about half those for @xmath70 , which is a direct result of the weighting by @xmath71 in equation [ bpsiphi ] .",
    "figure [ pdf_fig0 ] is disappointing from the observer s standpoint , because the observed distributions @xmath57 do not differ very much .",
    "these differences become smaller  inconsequential , in fact  when one includes measurement noise , as we shall discuss in detail for our data in  [ btotderivation ] . unfortunately , given the inevitable errors in _ any _ observation that is sensitive to @xmath15 , it seems practically impossible to distinguish among different functional forms for @xmath58 .",
    "nevertheless , the average value of @xmath15 is close to half the average value of @xmath0 for a wide range of intrinsic pdfs of the latter ; this also applies to the medians , but less accurately .",
    "therefore , this rule of thumb may be used to estimate the median or average @xmath0 from an ensemble of measurements of @xmath15 .",

    "if the normal vector to the sheet is oriented at angle @xmath24 with respect to the line of sight , we have    @xmath72    to find @xmath36 we follow the same procedures as above in  [ univar_b ] . for a single value of @xmath13",

    "the median value of @xmath12 is @xmath74 , reflecting the increased observed column for tilted sheets .",
    "the mean value of @xmath12 ( @xmath75 ) is not defined because the integral diverges logarithmically ; of course , this does nt occur in the real world , where sheets do nt extend to infinity .",
    "for example , if all sheets have aspect ratio @xmath76 , then @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "the observed velocity width comes from two sources , thermal and nonthermal .",
    "we can separate these because we have independent measurements of the kinetic temperature .",
    "thus , we can derive the line - of - sight ( los ) nonthermal ( `` turbulent '' ) line width and its associated energy density .",
    "how this relates to the total turbulent energy density depends on whether the turbulence is @xmath80 , @xmath81 , or @xmath82 .    here",
    "we assume that this turbulence is @xmath81 , i.e.  we assume that it is restricted to motions perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "we make this assumption because we show below that the typical turbulent mach number is equal to 3.7 . for velocities that are parallel to the magnetic field",
    ", such turbulence would produce strong shocks that would damp very rapidly .",
    "however , velocities that are perpendicular to the magnetic field can be as high as the alfvn velocity without producing shocks ; this is the basis for considering turbulent motions perpendicular to the mean field .",
    "we caution , however , that numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence find that magnetic fields do not ameliorate turbulent dissipation ( maclow et al .",
    "1998 ) , so our assumption might not have any basis in physical reality ; in this case the turbulence is isotropic ( @xmath82 ) and the observed distribution @xmath83 is equal to the intrinsic one @xmath84 .",
    "suppose that the magnetic field is oriented at angle @xmath24 with respect to the line of sight , as in  [ univar_b ] .",
    "suppose that turbulent motions are perpendicular to the fieldlines and isotropic in the azimuthal directions around the fieldlines , and along one direction perpendicular to @xmath27 have width @xmath37 ; this makes the full turbulent width @xmath85 .",
    "then line - of - sight width is    @xmath86",
    "to find @xmath83 we again follow the same procedures as in  [ univar_b ] and obtain    @xmath87^{-1/2 } &    { \\rm if } \\   { v_{turb , los } } < { v_{turb}}\\\\           0        & { \\rm otherwise } \\end{array } \\right . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    given a value for @xmath37 , @xmath88 as @xmath89 , but the cumulative distribution is well - defined with    @xmath90^{1/2}\\ ] ]    which gives the median @xmath91 median and mean @xmath92 .",

    "magnetic field strength should increase with volume density .",
    "if this increase would actually occur , then we would expect higher field strengths in the cnm than in other diffuse gas phases because the ism should exhibit approximate thermal pressure equality among the phases .",
    "this evidently does nt happen .",
    "in fact , this absence of field strength increase for small @xmath261 is well known from past studies ( e.g.  crutcher , heiles , & troland 2003 , section 3.4 ) , so this is hardly news .",
    "the field is strong enough to dominate the gas pressure , and therefore the dynamics . with a cnm median field @xmath262 @xmath2 g , which also applies elsewhere in the interstellar volume ,",
    "the magnetic pressure is @xmath263 @xmath264 k. this dominates the cnm pressure @xmath265 @xmath264 ( jenkins & tripp , 2001 ; wolfire et al , 2003 ) .",
    "when the field dominates the pressure , it is much less affected by the gas pressure or thermodynamic state .",
    "cnm structures are magnetically subcritical .",
    "when gravitation is important , the distinction between magnetically sub- and supercritical clouds occurs at @xmath266 ( nakano & nakamura 1978 ) . in subcritical clouds",
    ", the magnetic field dominates gravity and prevents collapse .",
    "our cnm sheets have @xmath267 and the median @xmath268 @xmath2 g , yielding a minimum ratio @xmath269 , far above the supercritical upper limit .",
    "gravity is far from important in these clouds , but if several clouds were to coalesce into a gravitationally - important one then magnetic forces would prevent gravitational collapse  unless the field were destroyed in the process , e.g.  by the annihilation of oppositely - directed fields during coalescence of individual clouds . in this sense ,",
    "the field is strong and must dominate the act of star formation in denser clouds that form from less dense interstellar gas .",
    "it is well accepted that interstellar hi often lies in sheets .",
    "paper ii showed this convincingly for the cnm structures . in the present paper",
    ", we noted that the observed histogram of observed column density @xmath12 falls monotonically with behavior close to @xmath270 .",
    "we then derived the pdf of the intrinsic column density for the sheets @xmath13 and found that it follows equation [ nobsobs ] between two limits , which are rather well defined .",
    "equation [ nobsobs ] behaves much like a @xmath271 distribution .",
    "figure [ nhstat ] convincingly shows that this is a good description of the observations .",
    "suppose , first , that the cnm results from shocks .",
    "we have in mind the mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) model , in which a supernova shock adiabatically compresses and heats the ambient gas ; as the gas cools , it does so under roughly constant pressure so its density increases , it cools faster , and soon becomes the cnm .",
    "as the shocked gas cools it slows . for low - velocity cnm , which is primarily what we observe",
    ", the swept - up column density depends on the energy injected and the ambient density .",
    "this dependence is complicated ( cioffi , mckee , & bertschinger 1988 ) , so we do nt attempt a detailed discussion .",
    "however , the swept - up column densities are not incomparable with our upper limit @xmath272 @xmath6 in equations [ nobsobs ] and [ nobsobsnumbers ] .",
    "thus , the @xmath273 dependence in equation [ nobsobs ] could be a reflection of the statistical distribution of the relevant function of injected energy and ambient density .",
    "another possibility is that the cnm arises from kinematical and thermal processes in the turbulent interstellar medium .",
    "we have in mind structures like those seen in numerical simulations of interstellar turbulence such as vzquez - semadeni , gazol , & scalo ( 2000 ; see references in paper ii ) .",
    "consider the `` triad region '' discussed in extensively in  8.2 of paper ii and heiles & crutcher ( 2005 ) .",
    "it has line - of - sight extent @xmath274 pc and plane - of - sky extent @xmath275 pc , for an aspect ratio @xmath276 .",
    "it also has typical turbulent velocity @xmath277 km s@xmath30 , which makes the line - of - sight crossing time @xmath278 yr .",
    "this is very short  interstellar kinematical evolution over human history !",
    "if this sheet were the result of a slowed shock , it seems remarkable that , in the presence of ism density fluctuations , the distance over which the swept - up column density is accumulated would allow the sheet to appear so coherent , and further that it would retain its coherence to be observable .",
    "the alternative is , we suppose , that cnm structures are transient , and that we can map as extensive only those that currently appear to be coherent .",
    "this @xmath271 behavior does not seem to be a capricious result .",
    "rather , it is a challenge to the theorists to reproduce it . deciding between the above two possibilities , or others , is a matter of the explanation reproducing the @xmath271 behavior .",
    "in  [ vaderivation ] we modeled the turbulent velocities as being anisotropic , i.e.  perpendicular to the magnetic field , and derived the intrinsic pdf @xmath84 from the observed one @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the the @xmath80 component of turbulent velocity ; for the @xmath81 case we modeled , the full component is @xmath279 . in  [ bivarvbobs ] we discussed the bivariate distribution @xmath280 .",
    "the data fit the model with anisotropic turbulence quite well , but the data also fit no correlation quite well , so the results are inconclusive . the observations can not distinguish between anisotropic and isotropic turbulent velocities .    we can , however , discuss topics such as the relative energy densities in turbulent motions and magnetism , that is , whether turbulent velocities are superalfvnic .",
    "doing this requires some care in definitions of parameters : we measure line - of - sight turbulent velocity dispersions and these must be converted to their 2- or 3-dimensional counterparts ; and we must include he as a component of the ism mass density . finally , we can discuss results in terms of the conventional plasma parameter @xmath281 , in terms of energy densities , or in terms of supersonic and superalfvnic .",
    "first we define velocities and the mach number .",
    "let @xmath282 be the @xmath80 turbulent velocity dispersion and @xmath283 be the thermal velocity dispersion . for isotropic turbulence ,",
    "the full turbulent velocity is @xmath284 . with this isotropic turbulence ,",
    "the turbulent mach number @xmath285 is    @xmath286    here @xmath287 is the velocity of sound ; the appropriate sound velocity is the isothermal one because thermal equilibrium is reached quickly in the cnm , so    @xmath288    the volume density is    @xmath289    where @xmath290 is the fractional abundance of he by number and @xmath291 is the mass of the h atom ; we adopt @xmath292 .",
    "similarly , for the alfvn velocity @xmath293 , we have    @xmath294    the information propagation velocity perpendicular to the field lines is equal to the alfvn velocity @xmath293 .",
    "the mean square velocity perpendicular to the field lines is twice the line - of - sight value .",
    "consequently , we define the alfvnic turbulent mach number @xmath295 as    @xmath296    if @xmath297 , then then shocks will develop ; this is the superalfvnic case .",
    "next we define energy densities .",
    "the turbulent energy density is    @xmath298    here we include the quantity @xmath299 to allow for anisotropic turbulence",
    ". if turbulent velocities are only perpendicular to @xmath27 , then @xmath300 ; isotropic turbulence has @xmath301 ( the case assumed in paper ii ) .",
    "of course , the magnetic energy density is    @xmath302    the ratio is    @xmath303    finally , we define the conventional plasma parameter @xmath304 , which compares thermal and magnetic pressures :    @xmath305    for comparison of turbulent and magnetic effects , we calculate the relevant ratios for the following adopted parameter values , which are close to the medians :    [ typicalvalues ] @xmath306 @xmath307 @xmath308 @xmath309 @xmath310    here @xmath311 is a typical cnm temperature from paper ii .",
    "@xmath312 is from jenkins & tripp ( 2001 ) and wolfire et al .",
    "the value for @xmath313 km s@xmath30 is the median from  [ vaderivation ] .",
    "the value for @xmath10 is the median from  [ montecarlo ] .",
    "these values provide    @xmath314    @xmath315    @xmath316    @xmath317    if the field were small , then turbulence would be isotropic with @xmath301 . however , it is not so small , but neither is it so large that we could say for certain that @xmath300 .",
    "the limits @xmath318 correspond to @xmath319 .",
    "these values should be regarded as representative .",
    "not all cnm clouds have the median values , so these parameters have a considerable spread .",
    "one interesting question is whether _ any _ cnm clouds have high @xmath304 , i.e.  whether any cnm clouds have negligible magnetic field .",
    "we can not answer this because @xmath320 and neither @xmath321 nor @xmath322 is attainable for an individual cloud .",
    "moreover , the functional form of @xmath0 is ill determined : we can not even distinguish between all values being the same ( a delta - function distribution ) and a gaussian ( which has a significant population of very high field strengths ) ; see  [ montecarlo ] .",
    "our numbers indicate that magnetism and turbulence are in approximate equipartition .",
    "the approximate equipartition suggests that turbulence and magnetism are intimately related by mutual exchange of energy . in the absence of turbulence , magnetic energies do not dissipate because the magnetic field can not decay on short time scales . but with turbulence",
    ", the field may be able to decay rapidly ( heitsch & zweibel 2003 ; lazarian & visniac 1999 ; zweibel 2002 ) . moreover , numerical simulations suggest that supersonic turbulence also dissipates rapidly , even when the field is strong ( maclow et al 1998 ) . however , it is not obvious to us that these dissipative processes should lead to the observed equipartition between turbulence and magnetism .",
    "we suspect the answer lies in hennebelle & perault s ( 1999 ) result and maclow s ( private communication ) observation that the cnm components result from the transient nature of turbulent flow : the cnm occupies regions where densities are high , produced by converging flows , and the density rise is limited by pressure forces .",
    "these limiting pressures are magnetic because the gas has small @xmath304 , meaning that thermal pressure is negligible and the dynamical equality makes the magnetic pressure comparable to the converging ram pressure and leads to apparent equiparition .",
    "the equipartition looks like a steady - state equilibrium , but it is really a snapshot of time varying density fields and our immediate observational view is a statistical result over a large sample . in other words , our current observational snapshot shows an ensemble at a given time . against this",
    "we compare the numerical simulations , which are stationary in the sense that they have been allowed to run long enough that the statistical properties become time - independent .",
    "such simulations are also ergodic , with statistical properties over time being equivalent to those over space . with this view",
    ", the ism dynamically evolves through turbulence and its properties are governed by statistical equilibrium of energy inputs and dissipation .",
    "these matters are discussed at length in the excellent review by maclow & klessen ( 2004 )    it is a pleasure to acknowledge discussions with martin bureau , jeremy darling , avinash deshpande , doug finkbeiner , patrick hennebelle , dave hollenbach , mordecai maclow , and chris mckee .",
