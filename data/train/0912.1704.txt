    "we have studied the dynamics of a single level molecular qd embedded in a josephson junction , in which the mechanical motion of the qd is couples to the supercurrent . in the static limit , i.e.",
    "when the qd is rigid , the supercurrent between the superconducting electrodes is mediated via two - electron transitions in the qd , a behavior which remains also when the qd moves between the electrodes .",
    "the rate of the two - electron transitions naturally depends on the occupation of the qd states and the energies of the transitions between the states .",
    "the rate does , in addition , explicitly depend on the motion of the qd .",

    "it turns out that we can clearly distinguish between six separate regimes in the phase space of the single electron energy level @xmath0 and the qd charging energy @xmath1 , see the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig - pd ] .",
    "the boundaries between the various regimes are set by pairing potential ( gap function ) of the electrodes , and the dynamics of the qd occupation depends on whether the single - electron transitions in the qd lie within or outside the gap .    in all regimes but one , there are more than two time - scales involved in the dynamics of the qd occupation .",
    "those additional time - scales are typically defined by the energies of the single - electron transitions relative to the superconducting gap ( and the chemical potential ) . for transition energies very far below ( above ) the gap , the time - scale for occupying , or deoccupying ,",
    "the corresponding states are set by the density of electron states in the electrodes , while the time - scale tends to zero as the transition energies approach the edge of the gap from below ( above ) .",
    "as the transition energies lie within the gap function , the occupation numbers of the qd are constants of the motion which implies that the dynamics of the qd occupation depends solely on i ) the two basic time - scales set by the bias voltage ( josephson frequency ) and the eigenfrequency @xmath107 of the oscillator , and ii ) the phase difference between the electrodes .",

    "ghz,@xcite one should be able to tune the josephson frequency such that @xmath148 .",
    "a coupling strength of @xcite @xmath149 should be sufficient for an efficient read - out .",
    "finally , the charging energy @xmath1 of the qd may be of the order of 1 | 10 mev , while the level spacing should preferably be larger than @xmath1 in order to control the electron occupation . for this requirement on the charging energy",
