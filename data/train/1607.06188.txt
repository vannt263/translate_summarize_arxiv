    "in the quote above , made at the first workshop on particle correlations and femtoscopy in the czech republic , professor biaas was expressing a frustration felt periodically by those of us who labor to understand deeply the fascinating features of soft - scale qcd as manifest in the quark - gluon plasma , a bulk thermodynamic system of deconfined colored partons as degrees of freedom . every time we gain a deeper insight into the physics and phenomenology of this system ( the dream ) , more detailed theories ( the ants ) or experimental observations make clear that the system is more complicated than we thought .",
    "new advances often raise more questions than they answer .",
    "professor biaas made this statement with a smile on his face , however .",
    "he clearly considers himself an ant in the spirit of the quote from proverbs : a worker with a mission much larger than himself , destined to build , piece by piece over the course of his life , an edifice in pursuit of that mission .",
    "he clearly relishes this role .",
    "it turns out that this symposium is held shortly before a milestone birthday of my own , and i found myself contemplating my own much less impressive anthills .",
    "one topic i have returned to repeatedly in various forms is the timescale of the system formed in a heavy ion collision .",
    "here , i discuss previous studies ( and one unpublished analysis ) to show the development of our understanding of these timescales as measured with two - particle intensity interferometry .",
    "to the general public , the field of heavy ion physics resembles high energy particle physics .",
    "the accelerators , the collaborations , and the detectors are mammoth .",
    "papers are written by committee , and talks are selected according to the bylaws set by councils and led by elected management teams .",
    "students are well - versed in the particle zoo ( often much more so , than their professors who grew up as nuclear physicists ) .",
    "the origins of the field , however , lie more in the realm of nuclear physics .",
    "concepts were developed and people trained in heavy ion experiments at facilities like ganil , sis / gsi , and the nscl / msu cyclotron facility .",
    "pions were rare and almost exotic .",
    "students were relatively well - versed in nuclear physics .",
    "however , heavy ion physics is a field of its own neither nuclear physics ( which strives to understand the nucleus in its seemingly infinite complexity ) nor particle physics ( which attempts to bypass the complexity of all interactions to study symmetries manifest as particles ) . in heavy ion physics",
    ", we seek to create and study a new _ system_. ideally , it will be a nearly thermalized system , so that we may study its equation of state . at lower energies , the equation of state of highly compressed , cold matter provides information relevant to the cores of neutron stars  @xcite . in ultrarelativistic energies , the equation of state of colored matter near the deconfinement transition probes qcd under the most extreme conditions  @xcite .",
    "the hot system is self - interacting and characterized by detailed flow fields .",
    "its femtoscopic substructure is dynamic and rich , with long lifetimes , anisotropic shapes , correlations between momentum and space - time , and whirling vortices . to understand the evolution of this substructure , it is important to obtain measures of the timescales involved .",
    "figure  [ fig : evolutioncartoon ] identifies two of them , for the case of ultrarelativistic collisions .",
    "unfortunately , they are often conflated , using the ambiguous term `` lifetime ; '' however , they are different , and it is best to keep the distinction clear .",
    "the evolution timescale @xmath0 refers to the time between initial interpenetration and particle freezeout .",
    "( particles `` freeze out '' when they cease interacting with each other and the system . )",
    "meanwhile , @xmath1 refers to the duration of the freezeout process itself .",
    "the evolution of an ultra - relativistic heavy ion collision is sketched to indicate two relevant timescales , corresponding to the evolution of the entire system and the duration of the freezeout process .",
    "see text for details.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "the technique of two - particle intensity interferometry is a well - developed tool to extract spatio - temporal information from dynamic subatomic sources .",
    "also known as femtoscopy , it exploits the fact that , given the observation of one particle , the conditional probability to measure a second particle depends on the relative momentum ( measured ) and the relative space - time position ( inferred , by measuring the conditional probability ) of the pair . for details and compilations of results ,",
    "i refer the reader to reviews at both low  @xcite and high  @xcite energy collisions .",
    "in principle , information about both space and time scales may be extracted by studying multi - dimensional correlation functions in the `` out - side - long '' ( or , for low energies , the `` longitudinal - transverse '' ) system of bertsch and pratt  @xcite . here ,",
    "the `` out '' ( or , for low energies , the `` longitudinal '' ) direction is parallel to the direction of motion of the particles , while the `` side '' ( or `` transverse '' ) is perpendicular to it .",
    "a long emission duration ( @xmath1 ) will generate a particle distribution extended in the direction of particle motion , and the resulting correlation will be less if the relative momentum is oriented in this direction .",
    "emission duration measurements are of particular interest , because a first - order phase transition from a deconfined to a confined state , is expected to extend the emission time  @xcite .    through the early nineties , no emission duration greater than @xmath22",
    "fm / c had been observed in the correlation data ; indeed , most extracted timescales were consistent with zero .",
    "for the newly available collisions at the multi - gev scale  @xcite , this was a disappointing development , though perhaps not shocking .",
    "however , at non - relativistic energies available at nscl and ganil , this was surprising indeed . at these lower energies ,",
    "the collision and evolution dynamics were believed to be better understood .",
    "repeated reports of vanishing timescales from correlation measurements led some experts at the time to wonder whether the femtoscopic technique itself was sufficiently well understood  .",
    "could femtoscopy really measure timescales , after all ?",
    "two publications  @xcite on proton correlations answered this important question with a resounding affirmative .",
    "in one , near multifragmentation energies , a lifetime greater than 10  fm / c was finally extracted from femtoscopic data . in the other , at compound nucleus energies , a lifetime greater than 1000  fm / c ( ! ! ) was reported .",
    "both timescales were of the order of theoretical expectations .",
    "why had all previous published results reported no difference between longitudinal and transverse correlation functions , and hence emission timescales consistent with zero ?",
    "the reason turned out to be simple : at least in the u.s .",
    ", we had all been looking in the wrong frame .",
    "two - proton correlation functions at small relative momenta probe the space - time geometry of the emitting system , because the magnitude of nuclear and coulomb final - state interaction and antisymmetrization effects depends on the spatial separation of the emitted particles  @xcite .",
    "the attractive s - wave nuclear interaction leads to a pronounced maximum in the correlation function at relative momentum @xmath3  mev / c .",
    "this maximum decreases for increasing source dimensions and/or emission time scales .",
    "the coulomb interaction and antisymmetrization produce a minimum at @xmath4 .",
    "nonspherical phase - space distributions , predicted for long - lived emission sources , can lead to a dependence of the two - proton correlation function on the direction of the relative momentum  @xcite . until 1993 ,",
    "however , such directional dependences had not yet been observed unambiguously .",
    "the first observation was published in 1993  @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university ( msu ) .",
    "a beam of ar ions at e / a=80 mev incident energy and intensity @xmath5/sec bombarded a sc target of areal density 10  mg / cm .",
    "charged particles were measured in the msu @xmath6 array , which consisted of 209 plastic @xmath7 phoswich detectors covering polar angles between @xmath8 in the laboratory frame .",
    "one of the hexagonal modules of the @xmath6 array , located at @xmath9 in the laboratory frame , was replaced by a 56-element high - resolution hodoscope .",
    "each @xmath7 telescope of the hodoscope consisted of a @xmath10-thick si detectors backed by a 10-cm - long csi(tl ) detector and subtended a solid angle of @xmath11  msr .",
    "the energy resolution was about 1% for 60  mev protons ; this is important for measuring large source sizes .",

    "cuts on the relative orientation of @xmath34 and @xmath27 are sensitive to the motion of the source , since the direction of the total momentum depends on the rest frame , while the direction of the relative momentum at least in the nonrelativistic limit does not .",

    "the top panel shows correlation functions for which the angle @xmath28 was defined in the center - of - momentum frame of projectile and target ( @xmath42 ) ; for central collisions of two nuclei of comparable mass , this rest frame should be close to the rest frame of the emitting source .",
