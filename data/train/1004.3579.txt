    "white dwarf stars offer several advantages for astrophysical study .",
    "first , they are the evolutionary endpoint of about 97% of all stars and are therefore representative of a large fraction of the stellar population .",
    "second , the source of their pressure support is electron degeneracy @xcite so their bulk mechanical structure is well understood .",
    "third , nuclear reactions , if any , contribute a negligible amount to their energy , so their evolution is dominated by simple cooling @xcite .",
    "finally , they are observed to pulsate in specific temperature ranges .",
    "the pulsators are believed to be typical in every other way , so what we learn _ asteroseismologically _ about them should apply to all white dwarf stars ( for recent reviews , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to learning about the stars themselves , the relative simplicity of white dwarfs makes them ideal laboratories for testing and constraining poorly - understood physical processes .",
    "one such process , convection , is an important energy transfer process in most stars , yet it remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in stellar modeling .",
    "for instance , main - sequence stars at least 20% more massive than the sun have convective cores , and the amount of convective overshoot and mixing is the primary factor that determines their main sequence lifetimes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , red giants and agb stars have large convective envelopes , and the details of convection play a role in the evolution of their surface abundances and in their overall evolution @xcite .",
    "we have developed a method which uses the pulsations of white dwarf stars to measure fundamental parameters of their convection zones .",
    "the physical idea is that the pulsations cause local surface temperature ( `` @xmath0 '' ) variations that lead to local variations in the depth of the convection zone . as the convection zone waxes and wanes it both absorbs and releases energy , modulating the local energy flux @xcite . due to",
    "the extreme temperature sensitivity of convection , finite amplitude pulsations can lead to highly nonlinear light curves @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we showed how a simple numerical model could be used to obtain not only good light curve fits but also information on the average depth of a star s convection zone and the inclination angle of its pulsation axis .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that by considering the nonlinear response of the convection zone @xcite one could obtain excellent fits to the light curves of two ( nearly ) single mode white dwarf pulsators .",
    "we have since extended this technique to multi - periodic stars @xcite and have taken into account the nonlinear relationship between the bolometric and observed flux variations @xcite . in this section",
    "we describe these effects and show how they have been added to our nonlinear light curve fitting technique .",
    "our approach is well - summarized in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , we assume that the convective turnover time of fluid elements in the convection zone is short ( @xmath1  s ) compared to the periods of pulsation ( @xmath2  s ) , so that the convection zone responds almost instantaneously to the pulsations and is always in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "in addition , we assume that the perturbation of the flux at the base of the convection zone is sinusoidal .",
    "next , we assume that the luminosity changes are due only to temperature changes and _ not _ to geometric effects ; @xcite found that the fractional radius change @xmath3@xmath4 for the davs , with temperature variations ( and the associated changes in limb darkening ) accounting for well over 99% of the luminosity variation , and this result was confirmed by @xcite for both the dav and dbv stars .",
    "finally , the surface convection zones of pulsating white dwarfs are quite thin geometrically , of order @xmath5 of the radius of the star ; this allows us to use the plane parallel approximation and neglect horizontal energy transport . with these assumptions we are able to derive a relationship between the local flux at a given ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) entering the convection zone at its base , @xmath8 , and that leaving it at the photosphere , @xmath9 : @xmath10 where the new timescale @xmath11 describes the changing heat capacity of the convection zone as a function of the local photospheric flux .",
    "we parameterize it as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the equilibrium value of @xmath14 , @xmath0 is the instantaneous effective temperature and @xmath15 is its equilibrium value , and @xmath16 is a parameter describing the sensitivity of @xmath14 to changes in @xmath0 . from standard mixing length theory of convection we expect that @xmath17 for davs and @xmath18 for dbvs .",
    "it is this extreme temperature sensitivity which is responsible for the large nonlinearities seen in white dwarf pulsations . for reference , this timescale",
    "is closely related to the standard thermal timescale ( @xmath19 ) at the base of the convection zone : for the davs @xmath20 @xcite and for the dbvs @xmath21 . with the further assumption that the angular dependence of @xmath8 is given by a spherical harmonic @xmath22",
    ", we can calculate the bolometric flux changes at the surface of the model , and average them appropriately over the visible disk of the model .",
    "since 2005 we have made important technical improvements to the light curve fitting code .",
    "first , we extended the code to include the more common multiperiodic case , where many modes with different @xmath23 and @xmath24 values are simultaneously present .",
    "thus , the flux at the base of the convection zone is now given by a sum over the modes : @xmath25 in this formula , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the amplitude , angular frequency , phase , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 values of the @xmath31-th mode , and the total number of modes is @xmath32 .",
    "second , we adapted the code to simultaneously fit an arbitrary number of observations ( `` runs '' ) .",
    "this is a necessary step for applying this technique to multiple runs obtained from whole earth telescope ( wet ) campaigns as well as successive nights of single - site observations .",
    "since the code allocates and deallocates memory as needed it typically uses only 8 mb of ram , independent of the number of runs included in the fit .",
    "third , we replaced our simple analytical prescription for limb darkening with tabulated values based on a grid of our model atmospheres ( for a description of the models , see * ? ? ?",
    "this grid ranges in @xmath0  from 20,000  k to 30,000  k in steps of 500  k and in @xmath33 from 7.5 to 8.5 in steps of 0.25 . from this grid",
    "we instantaneously calculate the local flux as a function of @xmath0  and @xmath34 ; thus , variations in the limb darkening with @xmath0  are automatically included . in figure  [ limb ]",
    "we show examples of the limb darkening for a @xmath35 he atmosphere white dwarf model as a function of @xmath36 for a range of @xmath0   values .",
    "finally , we improved the way in which the local bolometric flux variations are mapped into variations in a given wavelength band .",
    "previously we used a flux `` correction factor , '' @xmath37 , to accomplish this . denoting by @xmath38 the flux in the passband @xmath39 , then , for small fractional changes in the fluxes ,",
    "@xmath37 was defined by @xmath40 where @xmath9 is the local bolometric flux at the photosphere and @xmath41 is the variation in the respective fluxes due to the pulsations .",
    "clearly , @xmath37 depends on the wavelength coverage of the passband as well as the wavelength distribution of the flux from the source . in previous analyses we estimated that @xmath42 for dbvs and @xmath43 for davs .",
    "the value for the davs is not that different from what one obtains from a proper calculation assuming a passband centered on 5000   . for the dbvs , however , the more detailed calculations yield a value of @xmath440.250.35 which _ is _ significantly different from the earlier estimates .    of course , @xmath45 is not strictly a constant but rather is a function of @xmath0  and therefore @xmath9 . for larger amplitudes ,",
    "departures from linearity between the fluxes become more important , and to do the problem properly we need @xmath38 as a function of @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath46 .    to calculate this flux conversion",
    "we use the same grid of db model atmospheres described earlier . in each model atmosphere , the flux is tabulated as a function of wavelength @xmath47 and viewing angle @xmath36 , so limb darkening is automatically included . using a given passband , we integrate it against the model atmosphere flux to obtain @xmath38 as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath36 , and @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath33 is essentially constant during the pulsations , we only have to interpolate once between sets of models for the given value of @xmath48 ; thus , we have @xmath49 . finally , since @xmath50 , we can express this as @xmath51 .    in practice",
    ", we are only interested in relative flux changes , so we calculate everything relative to a reference flux , which we take to be the equilibrium flux of the star .",
    "if we denote by a subscript `` 0 '' the equilibrium values of the fluxes , then the function @xmath52 we want is defined by @xmath53    in the top panel of figure  [ fplot ] we show the fluxes @xmath54 and @xmath55 as a function of @xmath0 , both normalized to one at @xmath56  k ; the filter @xmath39 is assumed to have an effective wavelength of @xmath57   .",
    "the response of this filter was obtained from convolving the wavelength response of the alfosc - fasu ccd , the not primary and secondary mirror reflectivities , an s8612 filter , and atmospheric absorption . in the lower panel",
    "we show the function @xmath52 defined in equation  [ ffunc ] as derived from these calculations .",
    "we see that while this is not a perfectly linear relationship , the deviations from linearity are not dramatic .",
    "thus , while we use the fully nonlinear relation in our calculations , we expect this effect to make only a minor contribution to the overall nonlinearities associated with the pulsations .",

    "our recent work with light curve fitting has been limited to nearly single mode pulsators : the davs g29 - 38 and gd154 , and the dbv pg1351 + 489 .",
    "this is because ( 1 ) mono - periodic data can be folded at the pulsation period , producing a high s / n `` light curve , '' and ( 2 ) the number of possible mode identifications ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 values ) for a single mode is small enough that all possibilities can be directly explored .",
    "gd  358 violates both of these conditions .",
    "first , due to the nonlinear interaction of its large amplitude modes , the pulse shape obtained by folding its light curve at a mode period is not the same as the pulse shape which would be obtained in the absence of other modes @xcite .",
    "second , gd  358 has a large number of observed modes ( see table  [ modelist ] ) and it is impractical to search all possible combinations of @xmath23 and @xmath24 values which each mode can take .",
    "for instance , if we assume gd  358 to have of order @xmath58 modes , all of which have @xmath59 , then all possible permutations of @xmath24 values yield a number of @xmath60 different cases !",
    "since each fit takes of order an hour on a single processor computer , this is completely impractical using a standard desktop computing approach .",
    "fortunately , gd  358 is well studied , so we have a good idea what the @xmath23 and @xmath24 values for the main pulsation modes are ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even so , our derived values of @xmath13 depend only weakly on the assumed mode identifications , so it is not necessary for the mode identification of each mode to be exact .",
    "furthermore , the extended time baseline and excellent coverage of the 2006 wet run allows us to obtain very accurate frequencies for these modes @xcite . with this as a basis , our approach is to assume that the frequencies and mode identifications are known and then to make nonlinear light curve fits to a subset of runs in the wet campaign which have high s / n .",
    "this implicitly assumes that the pulsations are coherent throughout the time spanned by the runs ; in section  [ obpm ] we show that this is not strictly true for some of the modes .",
    "high s / n data are desirable since we are mainly interested in the nonlinear part of the light curve , which itself is smaller than the linear part .",

    "the best fit resulted for an identification with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and had the following parameter values : @xmath71 s , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "this indicates that the value obtained for @xmath13 does not crucially depend on the mode identifications of each mode in the fit .",
    "examination of the fit for each individual run revealed an apparent modulation of amplitudes , i.e. , on some nights the variations in the light curve were smaller than the fit and on others they were larger .",
    "in addition , looking at data from single sites suggested that the change from a smaller to a larger amplitude state alternated on a roughly night to night timescale .    to test",
    "whether a geometric effect or a change in the background state of the star could be causing the night - to - night modulation of the amplitudes , we went back and re - fit each run in table  [ obslist ] individually .",

    "; it has an amplitude of @xmath75 and a period of @xmath76 days . on the other hand ,",
    "if we ignore the possible origin of these variations and simply consider them to be separate measures of @xmath13 , @xmath16 , and @xmath74 , then we obtain fairly conservative limits on the error of the mean values of these quantities : @xmath77  s , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "we return to the question of this modulation in section  [ obpm ] .",
    "during the 2006 wet run , gd  358 was stable in that the amplitudes and phases of its modes were fairly constant over the 3 week length of the run ( except for the modulation detailed above and in section  [ obpm ] ) .",
    "however , gd  358 is known to change its pulsation spectrum on a range of timescales .",
    "a spectacular example of this behavior occurred in 1996 . within a period of 36 hrs ,",
    "all of the power in the high @xmath80 range ( pulsations with periods @xmath81  s ) disappeared within detection limits . at the same time , gd  358 more than doubled its apparent pulsation amplitude , with power appearing almost exclusively at lower @xmath80 , with a period of @xmath82 s. over the next week , its amplitude decreased to `` normal '' levels , while the high @xmath80 power did not return for approximately one month .",
    "this dramatic change is documented in several papers , most recently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the episode itself is termed the `` sforzando '' after a musical term for a sudden and short - lived increase in loudness .    in figure  [ whoopsie ]",
    "we show a section of gd  358 s light curve during the _",
    "sforzando_. ironically , during this dramatic episode the light curve was much simpler . while the amplitude was larger , the star was essentially a single - mode pulsator and the individual pulses were more sinusoidal ( less nonlinear ) than before . still , gd  358 was in a transient state and not all pulses were identical .",
    "the upper and lower panels of figure  [ whoopsie ] show pulses significantly below and above the fit , while the middle panel seems to represent a repeating , `` quasi - static '' state . even with these caveats ,",
    "the relative simplicity of these data are ideal for nonlinear light curve fitting .    from a time series analysis of this short section of data ,",
    "we find that these pulses have a period of approximately 420.7  s. assuming @xmath59 and trying all values of @xmath24 , we find the best fit shown in figure  [ whoopsie ] : @xmath83 , @xmath84  s , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . for @xmath59 , @xmath70 a similar quality fit can be found , but it has a less plausible inclination angle ( @xmath87 ) that is not consistent with the values of @xmath74 previously found in this paper ; even so , @xmath88  s for this fit .",
    "if we assume @xmath69 then the best fit has @xmath89  s and @xmath83 , although it requires such a large intrinsic amplitude that we consider it unphysical . summing up , while we have good reasons for preferring the @xmath59 , @xmath83 identification for our fits , the overall value of @xmath13 is not strongly dependent on this identification .",
    "comparing these results to those of section  [ lcfits ] , we find that @xmath13 was much smaller during the _ sforzando _ than it was during the 2006 wet run .",
    "this implies that , for whatever reason , gd  358 s convection zone was thinner during the _ sforzando_. as we can see from figure  [ dbis ] , this would imply a @xmath0 several thousand degrees hotter than its normal temperature . for ml2/@xmath90 convection ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , this would mean @xmath91  27,000  k , which is two to three thousand degrees hotter than its normal equilibrium state .",
    "such an increase in temperature would lead to about a 40% increase in the bolometric luminosity . from figure  [ fplot ]",
    "we see that such an increase in the bolometric luminosity translates into a 1520% increase in intensity as measured in a passband centered at 5200   . while such a passband is reasonable for a ccd @xmath92 bg40/s8612 filter @xmath92 atmosphere ,",
    "the observations in 1996 were made with phototubes , and these are much more blue sensitive .",
    "thus , for a phototube passband centered around 3800    we expect intensity increases of about 2025% .    as reported in table  5 of @xcite , such an increase in intensity",
    "was observed in gd  358 during the _ sforzando _ event . in figure",
    "[ wamps ] we plot these data , where the triangles are data from mcdonald observatory and the squares are data from mt .",
    "suhora observatory in poland .",
    "both curves are normalized to a value of one near bjed @xmath93 .",
    "we see that these data , although sparse , strongly suggest that gd  358 underwent a sharp intensity increase and decline of about 2030% during this event .",
    "this corroborates our earlier interpretation that gd  358 had a thinner convection zone with a smaller value of @xmath13 , and that this thinness was due to its surface layers being temporarily hotter .",
    "we note that similar results and conclusions have previously been made by @xcite . using the approach of @xcite",
    "they were the first to make numerical simulations of gd  358 s light curve during the _ sforzando _ event .",
    "as in our present analysis , they found that the shape of the light curve could only be reproduced for higher effective temperatures than normally assumed for this star , suggesting a value of @xmath9427,000  k.      the physical origin of the _ sforzando _ event is completely unknown .",
    "all we know for certain is that the amplitudes of the high-@xmath80 modes rapidly decreased , leaving power in the @xmath95 mode , which itself _ increased _ in amplitude by approximately a factor of 30 . while we have no model to explain the disappearance of power in the high-@xmath80 modes , in this section we consider what would happen to the apparent amplitude of the @xmath95 mode if the convection zone were suddenly removed .",
    "one effect of the thermal response of the convection zone is to attenuate the amplitude of the flux variations incident on its base .",
    "it acts as a low - pass filter , reducing the photospheric amplitude of a mode according to @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the equilibrium value of the flux , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the instantaneous fluxes at the base of the convection zone and at the photosphere , respectively , and @xmath98 is the angular frequency of the mode @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the amplitude of the @xmath95 mode at the base of the convection zone was constant throughout the _ sforzando _ , equation  [ amps ] shows that a decrease in @xmath13 would naturally lead to an increase in observed amplitude .",
    "thus , for a 420  s mode we would see an increase of approximately a factor of 8 in its apparent amplitude as @xmath13 goes from @xmath99  s to @xmath100  s. this is a large factor , but it is still much less than the factor of @xmath101 increase that was actually observed .",
    "thus , the @xmath95 appears to have increased its intrinsic amplitude by of order a factor of 4 during the _ sforzando_. how it was able to do this on so short a time scale remains a mystery .",
    "in figure  [ dbis ] we plot the known determinations of the convective response timescale , @xmath13 , versus @xmath0  for the dbvs . based on the discussion in the previous section , gd",
    "358 is plotted twice : once for the 2006 data and once for the 1996 data .",
    "in addition , we show the position of the dbv pg1351 + 489 ( @xmath102  s , * ? ? ? * ) , where we have assumed the pure he fit for its @xmath0  @xcite .",

    "a third condition / prediction is the relative amplitudes of the geometric peaks .",
    "such a calculation makes assumptions concerning the nature and strength of the magnetic field , so this prediction of the model is the least reliable of the three . in equations  ( [ ampf])([ampl ] ) in appendix  [ app1 ]",

    ", we would still hope that the amplitudes could approximately be fit and/or predicted within the oblique pulsator formalism .",

    "we interpret these peaks as resulting from 2 components of an @xmath127 mode , each split into a geometric triplet by oblique pulsation .",
    "these two original peaks are part of an intrinsic triplet produced by standard rotational splitting , but the amplitude of the third member is below our detection threshold .",
    "we fit two sets of exactly evenly split triplets to the data set , where the central frequencies of each triplet are 1741.664 and 1743.725 @xmath36hz , and the value of the splitting is 5.362  @xmath36hz .",
    "the values of the fit parameters we obtained are given in table  [ obp ] . in figure  [ prewhiten ]",
    "we show the result of pre - whitening the @xmath126 region by this solution .",
    "the reduction in power of the ft is very significant , showing that evenly split triplets are a good representation of the data .",
    "this is a necessary condition for the oblique pulsator model to be applicable .",
    "second , we consider the phase relations within each of these equally split triplets . from table",
    "[ obp ] we see that the first triplet has @xmath128 and that the second triplet has @xmath129 .",
    "the oblique pulsator model also passes this test with flying colors .",
    "in addition , the fact that @xmath130 rather than 0.0 implies that the modes are not axi - symmetric , i.e. , @xmath131 for both modes . for whatever reason ,",
    "the @xmath83 member of the original triplet is not present at observable amplitudes .",
    "finally , we wish to test the ability of the oblique pulsator model to adequately reproduce the amplitudes of the geometric peaks . to calculate the amplitudes we use the analytical expressions given in appendix  [ app1 ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to perform the fits we have used a genetic algorithm @xcite .",
    "this allows us to search the @xmath24 values of each intrinsic triplet as well as the values of the parameters @xmath74 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 .",
    "as we demonstrate below , such a fit is more constrained than one would think given the six data points and five free parameters .    in figure  [ amp ]",
    "we show the result of the fit to the amplitudes in table  [ obp ] .",
    "the fit is quite impressive .",
    "it has the added bonus that triplets  1 and 2 are _ required _ to originate from @xmath131 intrinsic modes and they must have opposite signs .",
    "this corroborates our earlier result based on the phases that both triplets originated from @xmath131 intrinsic modes .",
    "given the near equality of the number of data points and free parameters we wished to assess how easily our model could reproduce any data set . to do this",
    ", we randomly generated amplitudes for 500 pairs of triplets and fit them in the same way we fit the data , normalizing the residuals by the mean squared amplitudes of the two triplets .",
    "we found that in only 11 cases out of 500 were the random amplitudes better fit by our model than the measured amplitudes were .",
    "thus , we conclude that our amplitude fits are significant at the @xmath132% level .    as a final check on this procedure",
    ", we use these amplitudes together with equations  [ ampf ] and [ ampl ] to pre - whiten the @xmath126 region of the ft , as shown in figure  [ prewhiten2 ] .",
    "although considerably more constrained , this pre - whitening is clearly just as effective as that shown in figure  [ prewhiten ] .",
    "thus , the oblique pulsator model passes all tests with flying colors when applied to the @xmath126 region of the ft .",
    "the relative amplitudes of the peaks within a triplet split by oblique pulsation / rotation depend on @xmath74 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 ( see section  [ obpmf ] for a definition of these quantities ) . from the amplitude",
    "fits obtained in the previous section , we find that @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "this value of @xmath74 is close to that obtained from our nonlinear light curve fits , @xmath136 ( section  [ lcfits ] ) .",
    "this provides an important consistency check on both methods .",
    "given that @xmath74 is the angle between the rotation axis and our line - of - sight and that @xmath120 is angle between the rotation and pulsation / magnetic axes , the effective inclination angle of a mode aligned with the magnetic axis should vary between @xmath137 and @xmath138 as the star rotates , i.e. , between @xmath139 and @xmath140 . from the top panel of figure  [ theta1 ] we see that @xmath74 varies with about half of this amplitude .",
    "the straightforward explanation for this is that only the @xmath126 modes are affected by oblique rotation , while the other modes are aligned with the rotation axis . as a result",
    ", the value of @xmath74 shown in figure  [ theta1 ] represents the average inclination angle for all modes .",
    "averaging over all modes yields an inclination angle which varies by about @xmath141 rather than the full @xmath142 experienced by the @xmath126 modes .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath121 is a measure of the relative strength of the coriolis and magnetic perturbations ; the fit value @xmath135 indicates that the magnetic field is the dominant perturber .",
    "this reinforces the idea that the pulsations of these modes are tied to the magnetic axis .",
    "in addition , for a large - scale dipole field simple perturbation theory applied to @xmath59 and 2 modes yields @xmath143                  \\frac{18}{7 } - \\frac{2}{7 } m^2 , & \\ell = 2           \\end{array }           ,           \\right . \\label{alm}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 is the perturbation to the frequency of the mode due to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "together with equation  ( [ xdef ] ) , the fact that @xmath121 is positive means that @xmath145 , which in turn suggests that @xmath146 . in reality",
    ", this indicates that these modes , at least in the surface layers , may not be pure @xmath59 modes but contain a mixture of other higher @xmath23 components .",
    "the success of the oblique pulsator model in explaining the @xmath126 peaks constitutes evidence that oblique pulsation plays an important role in gd  358 . however , there is little conclusive evidence that other modes in this star are undergoing oblique pulsation . on the contrary ,",
    "the stable @xmath95 and 9 triplets are consistent only with the traditional case of the pulsation axis aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "a possible explanation is that the outer turning points for the @xmath95 and 9 modes are farther from the surface than they are for the @xmath126 modes , so if the dominant magnetic effects are also confined to the surface layers then the lower @xmath80 modes would not be affected by the magnetic field and the higher @xmath80 modes would .",
    "the _ magnitudes _ of the multiplet splittings / fine structure also present a challenge .",
    "for instance , the oblique pulsator model requires a rotation frequency of 5.36  @xmath36hz , whereas the splittings of the @xmath95 and 9 modes , believed to result from standard rotational splitting , give a value of 7.5  @xmath36hz @xcite .",
    "since different modes sample different regions of the star s interior , differential rotation in the radial direction could explain these results .",
    "a further concern is the internal consistency of the oblique pulsator fit .",
    "the central components of each of the triplets in table  [ obp ] should themselves be members of an intrinsic triplet which is split by rotation .",
    "this splitting is observed to be @xmath147hz and should equal @xmath148 for solid body rotation of the star .",
    "this is satisfied if @xmath149 instead of @xmath150 as is expected for @xmath59 modes .",
    "the splitting within a geometric triplet is a direct measure of the _ surface _ rotation rate , while the difference in frequency of the central components of these triplets ( the `` intrinsic '' modes ) is given by @xmath148 , where @xmath105 represents a _ radial average _ of the rotation profile .",
    "thus , differential rotation , with the interior rotating more slowly than the surface layers , could explain these values .",
    "an alternate explanation is that the magnetic field mixes higher @xmath23 components into the spatial structure of the @xmath126 modes .",
    "they would therefore have rotational constants @xmath151 indicative of higher @xmath23 modes . since @xmath152 for moderate to high @xmath80 modes , these modes would have correspondingly smaller values of @xmath151 .",
    "a further possibility is that the intrinsic modes have @xmath69 instead of @xmath59 . in this case",
    "only 3 of the 5 possible geometric peaks would be large enough to be detectable .",
    "first , we note that the predicted phase relations are the same as for the @xmath59 case , so the measured phase relations support either case equally . also , since @xmath153 for @xmath69 , using the rotational splitting of the @xmath95 and 9 modes yields a splitting of @xmath154hz , which is close to the measured value of @xmath147hz . in this case , though , the value of the inclination angle , @xmath155 , does not agree with that from the light curve fits .",
    "also , the @xmath69 fits are somewhat less constrained than the @xmath59 fits : fitting 500 random amplitudes in the same way as the data , 12% of the fits were better than the fit to the data , making the @xmath69 fit significant at the 88% level .",
    "even so , given the ability of the oblique pulsator model to describe ( 1 ) the power in the @xmath126 region , ( 2 ) the phase relations between the geometric triplets , and ( 3 ) the relative amplitudes within the triplets ( to some extent ) , we believe that the above - mentioned inconsistencies do not warrant rejection of the model but rather point us in the direction of future improvements .",
    "for instance , the amplitude calculations include magnetic effects in a fairly simple way ; more sophisticated treatments may be necessary to adequately model the observations .",
    "also , differential rotation in the radial direction may be able to resolve the seeming discrepancy of the @xmath156 values for the @xmath59 case .",
    "in many respects gd  358 is a `` simple '' star to analyze . for instance",
    ", the spacing between the periods of its multiplets suggests that we are looking at successive radial overtone numbers of @xmath59 modes .",
    "this is based both on the fact that ( 1 ) given its distance , mass , and luminosity , only @xmath59 modes allow a consistent solution @xcite and ( 2 ) in many cases these multiplets are well defined triplets @xcite . furthermore , as a dbv it has no hydrogen layer , so fewer parameters are needed to model its structure .",
    "indeed , it is the best studied white dwarf variable and significant constraints have been placed on its interior structure @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "gd  358 is in many respects a complicated star to model . for instance , while the amplitudes of its modes can be fairly constant during a wet run , over timescales of a few months the amplitudes can change significantly .",
    "the most extreme case of amplitude change is the previously discussed _",
    "sforzando _ , in which dramatic amplitude changes occurred on a timescale of a day or less .",
    "we currently have no theory that adequately describes these changes .",
    "what we _ do _ know is that two independent lines of evidence indicate that gd  358 was hotter during the _ sforzando _ event .",
    "the first is that the average flux of gd  358 relative to the comparison stars is larger , and the second is that the nonlinear light curve fits indicate a thinner convection zone  presumably the result of an increase in surface temperature .",
    "if we assume that gd  358 remained hotter for approximately a day then such a temperature increase would require a total energy input of approximately @xmath157  ergs .",
    "while detailed nonadiabatic models of gd  358 s pulsational state just prior to the _ sforzando _ would be required , rough estimates indicate that this amount of energy may typically be present in the higher @xmath80 modes .",
    "thus , if these modes were somehow damped and deposited their pulsation energy in the surface layers of the star over the period of a day , this would explain gd  358 s temporary temperature increase .",
    "such a scenario would explain both the temperature increase and the disappearance of the high @xmath80 modes , although more detailed models would be necessary to check quantitatively the energetics .",
    "we note that an increase in the apparent amplitude of the @xmath95 mode is a generic feature of a thinner convection zone ( e.g. , smaller value of @xmath13 ) , although the predicted factor ( @xmath158 ) is still less than what was observed ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "while speculative , it is also possible that some mechanism may have transferred power from the high @xmath80 to the low @xmath80 modes , although we currently do not understand how this would proceed .",
    "perhaps least likely is the possibility that the hotter `` equilibrium '' state of the _ sforzando _ allowed mode growth and damping to occur on timescales given by linear theory and that these timescales were many orders of magnitude shorter than expected .",
    "another possibility is that the event was tied to a magnetic phenomenon and that this phenomenon somehow led to a temperature increase as well as a change in the amplitudes of the various modes .",
    "there are several reasons that this is not completely far - fetched .",
    "first , the oblique pulsator model used here requires a mechanism to align modes with an axis other than the rotation axis , and a magnetic field can provide this .",
    "second , the @xmath95 and 9 triplets are asymmetric in the sense that the @xmath83 mode is closer to either the @xmath159 or @xmath160 mode ( see figures  18 and 19 of * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps not coincidentally , the asymmetry seen in the splittings of the @xmath95 and 9 modes reversed themselves at the time of the _ sforzando _ , and this change has persisted ever since .",
    "this timescale of years is consistent with what is seen in the magnetic cycle of the sun and other stars @xcite .",
    "finally , small but definite shifts in frequency of order 0.5  @xmath36hz have been seen on timescales as short as 3 weeks . these could be a sign of magnetic activity : changes in the surface magnetic field could produce slight perturbations in the mode frequencies @xcite , and the timescale of a few weeks for these to take place again seems plausible .",
    "a final unresolved issue for gd  358 is differential rotation .",
    "taken at face value , the difference in triplet splitting between high @xmath80 and low @xmath80 modes implies significant differential rotation @xcite .",
    "in addition , the oblique pulsator model as applied in this paper implies differential rotation : the @xmath126 region requires a surface rotation rate of @xmath161  days whereas the @xmath95 and 9 splittings give a rotation rate of @xmath162  days .",
    "the @xmath95 and 9 splittings reflect a bulk average of the rotation rate whereas the frequency differences within the geometric triplets in the @xmath126 region give us the rate at the surface .",
    "in addition , the frequency splitting between the intrinsic modes in the @xmath126 region also implies differential rotation , albeit with the interior rotating less rapidly than the surface . previously , detailed examinations of the frequency splittings in gd  358 as a function of @xmath80 have been inconclusive @xcite , but such analyses did not take into account the possibility of oblique pulsation .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the pulsations themselves lead to differential rotation .",
    "@xcite has recently shown that g - modes in massive stars can transport angular momentum relatively rapidly compared to evolutionary timescales .",
    "this transport occurs predominantly in regions in which the mode is driven and/or damped and leads to differential rotation .",
    "if this effect occurs in white dwarfs then it could alter the rotation rate from the surface down past the base of the convection zone into the radiative damping layers .",
    "if the rotation profile of these outer layers is continually changing then this would also explain the small shifts in frequency which have been detected in gd  358 .",
    "in addition , a more dramatic shift in the rotation profile could be associated with the _ sforzando _ event .",
    "perhaps the outer part of gd  358 s rotation profile experienced a shift during this event and it has persisted in its new state for the past several years .",
    "this would explain the shift in asymmetry of the @xmath95 and 9 triplets that also occurred at this time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we have extended our nonlinear light curve fitting technique to the multiperiodic pulsator gd  358 .",
    "our fit to the 2006 wet data provides a good match to the light curves and we find that the thermal response time of its convection zone is @xmath163  s. this is considerably larger than that of the star pg1351 + 489 , for which @xmath164  s @xcite . this difference in @xmath13 is consistent with the effective temperatures of these stars : the pure he solution for pg1351 + 489 yields a @xmath0which is @xmath165  k hotter than that for gd  358 .",
    "we also obtained a fit to the light curve of gd  358 during the _ sforzando _ event in 1996 . these fits showed that gd  358 had @xmath166  s , a value much less than that determined from the 2006 data .",
    "this suggests that its effective temperature was approximately 2,000  k hotter in 1996 than in 2006 , and this is consistent with the estimate of @xcite that the light curve shape suggests @xmath167  k. independent evidence of gd  358 s brightness relative to comparison stars is also consistent with such a temperature increase at the time of the _ sforzando _ @xcite",
    ". the physical origin of this temperature increase will be the subject of future work .",
    "as expected , these data indicate an increase in the depth / mass of the convection zone with decreasing @xmath0 . a similar trend is given by ml2/@xmath168 convection @xcite , although the slope of the theoretical relation appears less steep than that of the data .",
    "in addition , lower values of @xmath169 are excluded . in general , @xmath13 is also a function of @xmath33 , albeit a somewhat weaker one .",
    "our ultimate goal is to map @xmath13 as a function of both @xmath0  and @xmath33 for both the dbv and dav instability strips .",
    "these data will provide insight into the physics of convection , still one of the largest uncertainties in stellar modeling .",
    "they will also serve as important constraints for new hydrodynamic simulations of convection which are starting to come online .",
    "multiple lines of evidence point to some of gd  358 s modes undergoing oblique pulsation , in particular , the peaks in the @xmath126 region .",
    "first , these peaks can be fit with two sets of exactly evenly spaced triplets .",
    "second , the relative phases of each of the components within the triplet indicate that each originates as a single @xmath160 or + 1 mode aligned with the magnetic axis ; as the star rotates , the magnetic axis precesses around the rotation axis , generating a triplet for each intrinsic mode . finally , the oblique pulsator model qualitatively and quantitatively fits the amplitudes of the peaks seen in the fourier transform .",
    "taken together , this marks the first time that oblique pulsation has been seen in a white dwarf variable .",
    "having now identified the characteristics of oblique pulsation in gd  358 we now know what to look for in other white dwarf variables ; we have found preliminary indications of it in other stars and in other data sets of gd  358 .",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , oblique pulsation may prove to be a diagnostic of both the magnetic field and its changes as well as a diagnostic of differential rotation .",

    "<S> convective driving , the mechanism originally proposed by @xcite for pulsating white dwarf stars , has gained general acceptance as the generic linear instability mechanism in dav and dbv white dwarfs . this physical mechanism naturally leads to a nonlinear formulation , reproducing the observed light curves of many pulsating white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> this numerical model can also provide information on the average depth of a star s convection zone and the inclination angle of its pulsation axis . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , we give two sets of results of nonlinear light curve fits to data on the dbv gd  358 . </S>",
    "<S> our first fit is based on data gathered in 2006 by the whole earth telescope ( wet ) ; this data set was multiperiodic , containing at least 12 individual modes . </S>",
    "<S> our second fit utilizes data obtained in 1996 , when gd  358 underwent a dramatic change in excited frequencies accompanied by a rapid increase in fractional amplitude ; during this event it was essentially monoperiodic . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that gd  358 s convection zone was much thinner in 1996 than in 2006 , and we interpret this as a result of a short - lived increase in its surface temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find strong evidence of oblique pulsation using two sets of evenly split triplets in the 2006 data . </S>",
    "<S> this marks the first time that oblique pulsation has been identified in a variable white dwarf star . </S>"
