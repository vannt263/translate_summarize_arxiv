    "despite the overall success of the standard @xmath0cdm inflationary model in matching the results from wmap , it is striking that the goodness - of - fit statistics for the data are rather poor @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 for the fit to the tt spectrum which implies a probability of only @xmath2 for the best fit model to be correct .",
    "the lack of power at large scales relative to the standard @xmath0cdm model prediction has motivated several alternative proposals for the spectrum and nature of the primordial fluctuations @xcite , however the uncertainties ( and cosmic variance ) at low multipoles are large and it has been argued that the observed low quadrupole ( and octupole ) are unlikely only at about a few per cent level @xcite .",
    "in fact attempts to judge the goodness - of - fit by eye can be misleading since neighbouring @xmath3 s are correlated ( being  pseudo-@xmath3 s evaluated on a ` cut ' sky ) ; taking this into account it is found @xcite that the excess @xmath4 comes mainly from sharp features or ` glitches ' in the power spectrum that the model is unable to fit .",
    "in particular there are glitches at @xmath5 , 200 and 340 amongst the first and second acoustic peaks .    the wmap team",
    "have noted that these glitches may have been caused by beam asymmetry , gravitational lensing of the cmb , non - gaussianity in the noise maps , or the method of power spectrum reconstruction from the cmb maps @xcite .",
    "however they have also considered the possibility that these glitches are due to features in the underlying primordial curvature perturbation spectrum @xcite , specifically in the ` multiple inflation ' model @xcite where sudden changes in the mass of the inflaton can generate characteristic localized oscillations in the spectrum .",
    "this is physically well motivated since spontaneous symmetry breaking can occur _ during _ inflation for ` flat directions ' in supersymmetric theories and such fields are gravitationally coupled to the inflaton @xcite .",
    "the resulting change in the potential of the inflaton field @xmath6 was modeled earlier as @xcite @xmath7 , \\label{tanh}\\ ] ] which describes a standard ` chaotic inflation ' potential with a step starting at @xmath8 with amplitude and gradient determined by the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "this was shown to result in oscillations in the primordial curvature perturbation spectrum by numerically solving the governing klein - gordon equation @xcite .",
    "the wmap team found that the fit to the data improves if such oscillations are allowed for , with a reduction of @xmath4 by 10 for the model parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum from multiple inflation more realistically , taking into account the evolution of both fields as dictated by the inflationary dynamics @xcite , and using a wkb approximation @xcite , rather than numerical integration to solve the governing equation , in order to gain insight into how such oscillations are generated . in a subsequent publication",
    "we perform fits to the wmap data with the cosmological parameters _ unconstrained _ , in order to investigate the sensitivity of their inferred values to such deviations from a scale - free spectrum @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the wmap glitches are due to oscillations in the primordial spectrum has also been considered in the context of inflationary models invoking ` trans - planckian ' physics @xcite .",
    "sharp features in the primordial spectrum may also have been generated by resonant particle production @xcite .",
    "several authors have attempted to reconstruct the curvature perturbation from the wmap data and have noted possible features in its spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is clearly necessary to have an analytic formulation of the modification to the usually assumed scale - free spectrum of the inflationary curvature perturbation , both in order to provide a link between cmb observables and the physics responsible for the glitches , and to distinguish between the various suggestions for such new physics .",
    "supergravity ( sugra ) theories consist of a ` visible sector ' and a ` hidden sector ' coupled together gravitationally @xcite . the standard model particles are contained in the visible sector and supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking occurs in the hidden sector .",
    "most sugra models of inflation have the inflaton situated in the hidden sector . this is because it is easier to protect the necessary flatness of the inflaton potential against radiative corrections there .",
    "the visible sector is usually assumed to be unimportant during inflation .",
    "however this might not be true if one of the visible sector fields undergoes gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "suitable candidates for this are the so - called flat direction fields which generically exist in supersymmetric theories ( for a review , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "these are directions in field space in which the potential vanishes , in the limit of unbroken susy . during inflation in supergravity theories",
    "scalar fields typically receive a contribution of @xmath14 to their mass - squared due to susy breaking by the large vacuum energy driving inflation @xcite .",
    "( for the inflaton this constitutes the notorious ` @xmath15 problem ' @xcite ; in common with most models of inflation we need to assume that some mechanism reduces the inflaton mass - squared by a factor of a least 20 in order to allow sufficient inflation to occur . )",
    "the susy - breaking mass term typically dominates the potential along the flat directions .",
    "if the mass - squared is negative at the origin in field space , the flat direction @xmath16 will be stabilized at an intermediate scale vev of @xmath17 by higher dimensional operators @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "these appear in the potential after integrating out heavy degrees of freedom , because we are working in an effective field theory valid below some cut - off scale , which we take to be the reduced planck mass : @xmath19 gev .",
    "we assume that the inflationary era when the observed curvature perturbation was produced was preceeded by a hot phase , so that all fields were initially in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the potential along the flat direction is then @xcite @xmath20 with a smooth interpolation at @xmath21 .",
    "here we have included the 1-loop finite temperature correction to the potential @xcite with @xmath22 being the number of helicity states with mass much less than the temperature .",
    "the finite temperature correction therefore creates a barrier of height @xmath23 in between the origin and @xmath24 .",
    "the tunneling rate through the barrier is negligible and so @xmath16 is confined at the origin until the temperature , which falls rapidly during inflation , reaches @xmath25 and the barrier disappears . the flat direction field @xmath16 then undergoes a phase transition as it evolves to its global minimum at @xmath26 .",

    "a more important effect occurs due to the _ gravitational _ coupling between @xmath16 and the inflaton field @xmath6 .",
    "the particular background inflationary cosmology in which the phase transition occurs is not directly relevant for our work . for definiteness",
    "we take it to be a ` new inflation ' potential with a cubic leading term which is a phenomenologically successful model with a naturally small inflaton mass @xcite .",
    "then , for example , a term @xmath33 in the khler potential which is allowed by symmetry ( near @xmath34 ) yields a coupling term @xmath35 in the inflaton potential , where @xmath36 @xcite . with @xmath37",
    "this causes the effective mass - squared @xmath38 of the inflaton to change from @xmath39 before the phase transition , to @xmath40 afterwards . this will affect the curvature perturbation spectrum which is very sensitive to the mass of the inflaton .    in order to produce observable effects in the cmb or large - scale structure",
    "the phase transition must take place as cosmologically relevant scales are leaving the horizon . in supersymmetric theories",
    "there are many flat directions which can potentially undergo symmetry breaking during inflation , so it is not unlikely that a phase transition occurred in the @xmath41 e - folds which is sampled by observations @xcite , particularly since the observations suggest that ( the last period of ) inflation may not have lasted much longer than the minimum necessary to generate an universe as big as the present hubble volume .",
    "some care is required in calculating the curvature perturbation spectrum for multiple inflation because we might _ a priori _ expect two - field inflation during the phase transition , when @xmath6 and @xmath16 evolve simultaneously .",
    "this might mean that both curvature as well as isocurvature perturbations are created , involving a significantly more complicated computation @xcite .",
    "however , as we show below , our model of multiple inflation is effectively single - field inflation as far as the generation of curvature perturbations is concerned .",
    "the curvature perturbation on comoving hypersurfaces @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the number of e - folds of expansion measured locally by a comoving observer passing from an initial , spatially flat , slice of space - time to a final , comoving , slice @xcite .",
    "the perturbations @xmath45 and @xmath46 are defined on the spatially flat time slice and the final comoving slice defines @xmath42 . the first time slice is taken during inflation , soon after horizon crossing , and the second time slice is taken at the end of inflation , after @xmath42 has become constant . during the phase transition the slow - roll conditions in @xmath6 are no longer satisfied but we assume the end of inflation to be well after this epoch .",
    "then we have @xmath47 and so @xmath48 which is just the single - field inflation expression for @xmath49 .",
    "this is because the vacuum energy is _ dominated _ by @xmath6 , which drives inflation , and @xmath16 has a negligible effect on the number of e - folds of inflation .",
    "the curvature perturbation spectrum is usually calculated analytically using the slow - roll approximation to some chosen order in the slow - roll parameters @xcite .",
    "this assumes the potential is relatively smooth , which is however inappropriate for multiple inflation .",
    "for example , for the standard chaotic inflation potential @xmath50 , the usual slow - roll expression gives @xmath51 where all quantities are evaluated at horizon crossing .",
    "this gives a simple ` step ' in the amplitude if the inflaton mass changes suddenly as in eq.([tanh ] ) , missing all the fine detail that we expect in the spectrum .",
    "( a discussion of the slow - roll approximation applied to a potential with a sudden change in its slope @xcite rather than in its curvature can be found in ref.@xcite . )",
    "therefore we must resort to first principles and use the general formalism @xcite for calculating the curvature perturbation spectrum . instead of the slow - roll approximation we use the recently suggested wkb approximation @xcite .",

    "it is usually assumed that the curvature spectrum from primordial inflation is scale - free , especially when fitting cosmological models to data on cmb anisotropies and large - scale structure .",

    "however it must be emphasised that these are ` toy ' models and the actual physics behind inflation is likely to be more complicated @xcite . in particular when one attempts to construct realistic models of inflation in the context of supergravity or string theory , more than one field is typically involved and their mutual interactions are unlikely to yield the usually assumed smooth potential .",
    "scalar fields other than the inflaton can exhibit non - trivial dynamics during inflation and affect the slow - roll evolution of the inflaton . in particular , ` flat direction ' fields , which are generic in such models , may undergo symmetry - breaking phase transitions and , by virtue of their gravitational coupling to the inflaton , induce sudden changes in its mass , resulting in multiple bursts of slow - roll inflation punctuated by such phase transitions @xcite .",
    "we have calculated analytically the effect of such sudden changes in the inflaton mass on the curvature perturbation , using a wkb method @xcite to solve the governing klein - gordon equation without recourse to any slow - roll approximations .",
    "although the analytic calculation does not yet provide an exact match to the exact numerical solution , it does capture the characteristic oscillations that are generated in the spectrum @xcite and provides considerable insight into the physics behind this phenomenon .",
    "there may be scope for developing more accurate calculational techniques in this context @xcite .",
    "it should be of course borne in mind that caution is required in using the standard calculational framework for the inflationary metric perturbation for the case of a time - dependent effective potential @xcite .",
    "nevertheless when the scalar fields involved are weakly coupled and the time scales involved exceed the hubble time , the usual results from perturbation theory ought to be valid .    given that the precision wmap data does show preliminary evidence for such oscillations @xcite , we are now investigating what the data imply for the physics of the multiple inflation model and indeed whether the estimation of cosmological parameters from the data is significantly affected when the primordial spectrum is not scale - free @xcite .",
