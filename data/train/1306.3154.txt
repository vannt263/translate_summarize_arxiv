    "the world of heavy quarks , charm and beauty , is experiencing a fast development , with a plethora of new states being found in facilities as babar , cleo , belle , bes @xcite .",
    "the coming facility of fair will certainly add new states corresponding to quantum numbers which are not accessible with present machines .",
    "the states capturing more attention are those that do not fit within the standard picture of mesons as @xmath3 or baryons as @xmath4 , and which require more complex structures , like tetraquarks , meson molecules , or hybrids including possible glueballs , for mesons , or pentaquarks and meson baryon molecules for baryons .",
    "the field of meson molecules in the charm sector has been much studied @xcite and many of the observed states with hidden charm and open charm are shown to be consistent with the molecule interpretation , with a good reproduction of the different observables of those states .",
    "the work on the charm sector is gradually moving to the beauty sector and there are works dealing with @xmath5 or hidden @xmath5 meson molecules built up from other mesons containing some @xmath5 quark @xcite .",
    "the recent discovery of the hidden beauty @xmath6 and @xmath7 states in three charge states @xcite , and hence with isospin i=1 , has brought a new stimulus to the molecular idea @xcite , since they can not be @xmath8 quarkonium states .",
    "one of the elements that has allowed progress in the heavy quark sector is the implementation of the heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) @xcite .",
    "qcd predicts that all types of spin interactions vanish for infinitely massive quarks and thus , for heavy quarks the dynamics is unchanged under arbitrary transformations of their spin .",
    "this heavy quark spin independence is the essence of the hqss , and leads to many predictions concerning properties of particles containing heavy quarks .",
    "it also implies that the leading interaction terms are independent of the flavor .",
    "however , the hqss does not determine the interaction , simply puts some constraints in it , and to proceed further to make predictions one must rely upon some experimental information or use models . in this sense",
    ", the work of @xcite uses properties from the x(3872 ) resonance , which is assumed to be a @xmath9 molecule , and extrapolates this information to make predictions of @xmath10 molecules .    an alternative approach to using empirical data to constraint",
    "the interaction is the use of some dynamical model .",
    "the use of chiral lagrangians has been a common thing in this kind of works , but its extension to the heavy quark sector is not straightforward .",
    "conversely , the use of the local hidden gauge lagrangians has allowed much progress in the heavy sector .",
    "indeed , the lagrangians of this theory @xcite , introducing pseudoscalar and vector mesons as building blocks , provides the same information as the chiral lagrangians up to next to leading order under the assumption of vector meson dominance @xcite , and additionally introduces explicitly vector mesons and their interaction in the theory .",
    "this feature is much welcome when working in the heavy sector , because the independence on the spin of the heavy quarks puts at the same level the @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and one has to deal with them simultaneously .",
    "the other bonus from using the hidden gauge formalism is that it shows that the leading chiral lagrangian is obtained by exchanging vector mesons between the interacting particles . in the su(3 ) sector , these are the @xmath15 . in the charm or beauty sector",
    "the @xmath11 of @xmath13 mesons contain a light quark , and in their interaction it is these light quarks that are exchanged with vector - meson quantum numbers , and then the analogy with the interaction in the light sector becomes apparent .",
    "of course in addition one might also exchange heavy vectors in the charm or beauty sectors , but their large mass renders their propagators small and those terms become subdominant . from this perspective",
    "it looks quite intuitive that many results obtained in the su(3 ) sector can be extrapolated to the heavy sector . what is less intuitive , but can be seen from the dynamics , is the recent finding in @xcite that the local hidden gauge dynamics fully respects the constrains of hqss . in this latter work , baryons with hidden charm",
    "are investigated .",
    "the resulting theoretical framework is also extended to study baryon states of hidden beauty in @xcite .",
    "the finding that the local hidden gauge approach respects hqss is quite relevant since it allows one to be more predictive , even if some phenomenology is still needed to regularize the loops of the theory .",
    "but certainly , having the interaction given by the hidden gauge lagrangians allows one to tackle theoretically many problems where there is scarce or no phenomenology , as is the case of the beauty sector .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper where we tackle the interaction of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the hidden beauty sector and make predictions for bound states .",
    "we will find bound states in all sectors and in sum we get six states with different quantum numbers .",
    "the states have their correspondence with states already seen , or predicted in the hidden charm sector .",
    "one bound @xmath16 state would correspond to the so called x(3700 ) , predicted in @xcite for which experimental support is obtained from the @xmath19 reaction in @xcite .",
    "two bound states are also obtained for @xmath17 in analogy to the @xmath20 x(3872 ) resonance that has c - parity positive , plus an extra one with negative c - parity , and three more states are obtained from @xmath18 corresponding to states with different spins obtained for the @xmath21 system in @xcite .",
    "all the states obtained have isospin i=0 . by using the leading term from the hqss generated from the local hidden gauge approach",
    ", we do not get i=1 states .",
    "thus , the interesting @xmath6 and @xmath7 states are not generated at this level .",
    "the fact that these states are weakly unbound from the @xmath17 and @xmath18 thresholds could hint at subdominant terms in hqss responsible for their generation , thus justifying why they do not appear just using the dominant term .",
    "following the work of @xcite for hidden charm baryons , we extrapolate the formalism to the hidden beauty sector for the mesons . therefore we can study mesons with hidden beauty with isospin @xmath22 , and spin @xmath23 .",
    "we take as coupled channels states with @xmath24 , @xmath25 and their corresponding antiparticles . for the different @xmath26 quantum numbers we have the following space states .",

    "+ with different spin quantum number there are 12 orthogonal states ( of which 6 are having hidden strangeness ) in the physical basis for @xmath0 . for @xmath1",
    "there are only 6 states since the hidden strangeness states have @xmath0 .",
    "next we will introduce a hqss basis @xcite , for which it is straightforward to implement the lowest order hqss constraints . in the hqss basis",
    "we will classify the states in terms of the quantum numbers , @xmath39 : total spin of the meson - baryon system , @xmath40 : total spin of the light quarks system , @xmath41 : total spin of the @xmath42 subsystem .",
    "note that we study ground state mesons , which means that all orbital angular momenta are zero .",
    "thus , we have 12 orthogonal states in the physical basis .",
    "the 12 orthogonal states in the hqss basis are given by    * @xmath43 , @xmath44 , * @xmath45 , @xmath46 , * @xmath47 , @xmath48 , * @xmath49 , @xmath50 , * @xmath51 , @xmath52 , * @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the subindex @xmath55 in the former states means that the light quarks are strange .    in order to take into account the hqss it is interesting to use the heavy quark basis in which the spins are rearranged such as to combine the spin of the @xmath42 quarks into @xmath41 since the matrix elements do not depend on this spin .",
    "one classifies the hqss in terms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the conservation of @xmath58 and @xmath57 leads to the conservation of @xmath59 and then in the hqss basis the matrix elements fulfil @xmath60    thus , in a given @xmath61 sector , we have a total of six unknown low energy constants ( lec s ) :    * three lec s associated to @xmath62 @xmath63 * three lec s associated to @xmath64 @xmath65    therefore in the hqss basis , the @xmath66 is a block diagonal matrix .    to exploit eq .",
    "( [ eq : hqs ] ) , one should express hidden beauty uncoupled meson - meson states in terms of the hqss basis.therefore , one needs to use 9-j symbols .",
    "the 9-j symbols are used to relate two basis where the angular momentums are coupled in a different way .",
    "taking two particles with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we can combine them to @xmath69 and finally @xmath69 to total @xmath57 .",
    "alternatively we can couple @xmath70 to @xmath71 , @xmath72 to @xmath73 , and then @xmath74 to total @xmath57 .",
    "these two bases are related as @xcite @xmath75 where the symbol @xmath76 stands for the 9-j coefficients .    as an example",
    "take a meson(m)-antimeson(@xmath77 ) state of the type @xmath78 and look at the recombination scheme on fig .",
    "[ fig:9j ] .",
    "thus in this case we have the correspondence , @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 the total spin of the meson and antimeson respectively .",
    "then one easily finds :    * @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 ( or @xmath86 ) have an extra minus sign in the former formulas .",
    "this is because we should take into account the c - parity for @xmath17 and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we know that @xmath90 , and then , we take @xmath91 , thus , @xmath92",
    ". then , the @xmath93 behaves like @xmath14 by changing @xmath94 but with a minus sign .",
    "therefore , we should put a minus sign to all the states which are constructed with one @xmath93 ( @xmath86 ) particle , listed above with hqss basis . one can easily check that the constructed state @xmath95 has positive c - parity , and @xmath96 negative c - parity ( the ones with hidden strangeness are similar ) .",
    "then , we have @xmath97    keeping in mind these changes required by the c - parity of the constructed states , now we can evaluate the transition matrix elements between the physical states . by taking into account the former states in the hqss basis , and using eqs .",

    "the coefficients @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) are the six unknown lec s of hqss , which depend on isospin and can be related using @xmath115 flavour symmetry .",

    "this symmetry is broken to @xmath115 by the large mass of the mesons containing the heavy @xmath5 quark . in the heavy quark limit ( for the @xmath5 quark ) , the mesons that contain the heavy quark are not dynamic , i.e. they can not be exchanged as a virtual particle . in the finite ( but large ) mass limit , these terms are suppressed by @xmath129 and they will be ignored in the present work .",

    "this second pole has a weak strength even in the single channel case .",
    "the origin of the lack of a second pole in the coupled channel case can be traced back to the potential @xmath201 . when the effects of coupled channel analysis are taken into account ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the determinant of the potential is proportional to ] @xmath244 with a small correction from the mass difference of the hidden strange sector and the non - strange one ( see eqs.([eq44])@xmath98([eq49 ] ) ) .",
    "since @xmath245 , this determinant is very small , hence one of the eigenvalues is very close to zero .",
    "this means that , in the corresponding channel , which is mostly hidden strange state , the mesons do not interact and hence can not form a bound state .    in the @xmath246 sector , the available channels are the @xmath18 and @xmath247 .",
    "when the coupled channel effects are taken into account , the @xmath204 matrix has a single pole which is located at @xmath248 mev ( @xmath249 mev ) when @xmath250 mev ( @xmath251 mev ) .",
    "this corresponds to a binding energy of @xmath252 mev ( @xmath253 mev ) with respect to the @xmath254 threshold . in table",
    "[ table2pp ] we present the masses and the couplings of this resonance to various channels for @xmath250 mev and @xmath255 mev .",
    "it is observed that both the binding energy and the couplings strongly depend on the value of the cut off chosen .",
    "increasing the cut off from @xmath250 mev to @xmath255 mev changes the binding energy by about @xmath256 mev whereas the couplings increase by a factor of two .",
    "this increase in the couplings is expected since as one increases the cut off , the potential has larger extent in momentum space , and hence the wave functions become narrower in coordinate space .",
    "a narrower @xmath257 wave wave function necessarily has a larger value at the origin .",
    "since the couplings are proportional to the wave function at the origin , as the wave function gets narrower its value at the origin increases and the coupling grows .",
    "as mentioned before , we deem the value of the lower cut off more realistic , and also in tune with @xcite . the value obtained with @xmath227 mev",
    "should be considered a generous upper bound .    in table",
    "[ table2ppn ] , we present the properties of resonances if the coupled channel effects are ignored .",
    "it is seen that the properties of the lighter resonance changes slightly by the removal of the coupled channel effects .",
    "its mass increases by @xmath258 mev ( @xmath259 mev ) and its coupling to the @xmath254 state is reduced by about @xmath260 ( @xmath261 ) if the cut off is taken as @xmath250 mev ( @xmath251 mev ) .",
    "since the coupled channel effects are ignored , this resonance does not couple to @xmath262 . in this case",
    ", a weakly bound second pole is also observed in the @xmath263 channel .",
    "this second pole has a binding energy of @xmath264 mev ( @xmath265 mev ) when the cut off is taken to be @xmath250 mev ( @xmath251 mev ) .",
    "this binding energy is more than ten times smaller than the binding of the lighter resonance .",
    "the coupling of this heavier resonance to @xmath266 is also about four times smaller that the coupling of the lighter resonance to the @xmath254 channel .",
    ".the couplings to various channels for the poles in the @xmath267 channel for @xmath250 mev ( left panel ) and @xmath255 mev ( right panel ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table0ppn ]    in tables [ table0pp ] and [ table0ppn ] , we present our results for the @xmath268 sector . in this sector , the new states are @xmath236 and @xmath269 . the similarities that we observed when comparing the @xmath246 and @xmath270 sectors also exists when the @xmath268 channel is compared with the previous cases , i.e. the binding energies are degenerate with the previous cases and due to the even smaller total mass in the @xmath271 , the couplings are smaller .",
    "the binding obtained here for @xmath147 with the small cut off is very similar to the one obtained in @xcite using the extended chiral quark model , where vector mesons are allowed to be exchanged between quarks , with clear similarities with the dynamics of the local hidden gauge approach .",
    "note that the observed degeneracies are consistent with the results obtained in @xcite . in these works",
    ", it is shown that in the heavy quark limit , in the spectrum of molecules of @xmath272 and @xmath273 where @xmath274 is a heavy quark and @xmath181 is any other quark , the @xmath268 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 states have degenerate binding energies . furthermore , there are two other states with @xmath268 and @xmath277 that have degenerate binding energies which are not necessarily degenerate with the previous four . in our work , we observe that all six states have degenerate binding energies .",
    "these degeneracies can be observed from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ji00])@xmath98([eq : ji20 ] ) . if one uses the hqss basis , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ji00 ] ) and ( [ eq : ji101 ] ) will be brought to a block diagonal form .",
    "one of these blocks in both of these matrices is identical to the matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ji102 ] ) , resulting in four degenerate states .",
    "the other block is given by @xmath278 and this block in each of the two matrices correspond to the other two degenerate states .",
    "in the approximations used in this work , the low energy constants @xmath279 and @xmath280 are equal ( see discussions leading to eqs .",
    "@xmath98 ) . then automatically we get the uncoupled potentials of eqs .",
    "hence , in this approximation , all six states should be degenerate in binding , and this is indeed observed in our analysis .",
    "in the present work we investigate the hidden beauty sector by combining the dynamics of the local hidden gauge lagrangians extrapolated to @xmath128 with the constraints of heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "the @xmath128 symmetry is broken to @xmath115 symmetry by taking large masses for the mesons containing a @xmath5-quark .",
    "it is shown that in the @xmath1 sector , the interaction is too weak in the current approach to form any bound states . in the @xmath0 sector , both the hidden strangeness and non - strange channels are analyzed .",
    "the results show that the binding energies in all the possible @xmath281 channels are degenerate .    when the couplings between the hidden strange and non strange sectors are ignored , bound states are observed in both sectors .",
    "hence there are a total of @xmath2 hidden beauty resonances , with binding energies @xmath282 mev ( @xmath283 mev ) with respect to the non strange threshold , and @xmath2 hidden beauty - hidden strange resonances , with binding energies @xmath264 mev ( @xmath265 mev ) with respect to the hidden strange threshold , for a cut off value of @xmath250 mev ( @xmath255 mev ) .",
    "the hidden beauty - hidden strange resonances are found to be weakly bound .",
    "our prediction of the existence of resonances close to the the hidden strange threshold is not robust with respect to the effects of the coupled channels .",
    "when the coupled channel effects are taken into account they disappear , whereas the masses of the other resonances are only slightly modified .",
    "hence we predict with confidence the existence of ( at least ) @xmath2 resonances in the hidden beauty sector , with possible other @xmath2 heavier resonances which are mainly hidden beauty - hidden strange resonances .",
    "the couplings of each resonance to the various channels are also analyzed and for the lighter resonance in each channel , the couplings are shown to depend very slightly on the couple channel effects .",
    "it is also shown that the couplings are quite sensitive to the value of the cut off used , hence they should be taken more as an order of magnitude estimate rather than precise predictions .",
    "when any of these states is experimentally found , the tuning of the cut off to the observed energies will also allow to be more precise on the value of these couplings .",
