    "it concerns the remarkable solidarity between voice leading parsimony on the one hand and triadic transformations on the other .",
    "how do the two aspects fit together , precisely ?",
    "the study of voice leading requires the localization of chord tones within an ensemble of voices .",
    "the study of triadic transformations , and in particular the investigation of the duality between the @xmath3 and @xmath4-groups , seems either to require an abstraction of the triads from their concrete construction from tones or it leads to a dualistic voice leading behavior , which is in conflict with the principle of voice - leading parsimony ( see figure [ fig : cakecognac ] ) .        in the light of the impact of dialectics upon the development of music theoretical ideas in the writings of moritz hauptmann and hugo riemann",
    "it is remarkable that nora engebretsen portraits in @xcite a main line of conceptual development in the second half of the 19th century within the garb of a dialectical triad :    1 .",
    "hauptmann s focus on common - tone retention in ( diatonic ) triadic progressions ( thesis ) 2 .",
    "von oettingen s focus on the dualism between major and minor triads ( antithesis ) 3 .",
    "riemann s attempts to integrate both view points in a chromatic context ( synthesis )    despite of its historical attractiveness this dialectical metaphor remains euphemistic , until a successful neo - riemannian synthesis of voice leading and lewinian transformational theory has been achieved .",
    "the present paper takes a step in this direction and , in particular , attributes precise transformational meanings to the arrow labels in the networks of figure [ fig : cakecognac ] .",
    "in preparation for our treatment of permutations in neo - riemannian groups , we briefly recall the well - known duality between the @xmath3-group and @xmath4-group , and present a new proof of the fiore  noll construction of the dual group in the finite case . the basic objects upon which the @xmath3-group and @xmath4-group act are pitch - class segments with three constituents .",
    "recall that a _ pitch - class segment _ is an ordered subset of @xmath9 , or more generally @xmath10 .",
    "we use parentheses for pitch - class segments because it clashes with the mathematical notation for the subgroup generated by @xmath11 , which we will also need on occasion . ] to denote a pitch - class segment as an @xmath5-tuple @xmath12 .",
    "the sequential order of the pitch classes may , for example , relate to the temporal order of notes in a score , or to the distribution of pitches in different voices in a certain registral order . in connection with recent studies to voice leading , such as @xcite , one may wish to include voice permutations into the investigation of contextual transformations in non - trivial ways , as we do in section  [ sec : permutations ] .",
    "the @xmath3-group consists of the 24 bijections @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 . via its componentwise action on @xmath17-tuples ,",
    "this dihedral group acts simply transitively on the set @xmath18 of all the transposed and inverted forms of the root position @xmath19-major 3-tuple @xmath20 .",
    "note that the minor triads in @xmath18 are not in root position , e.g. @xmath21-minor is @xmath22 .",
    "like any group action , this action corresponds to a homomorphism from the group to the symmetric group on the set upon which it acts , namely a homomorphism @xmath23 .",
    "the _ symmetric group on @xmath18 _ , denoted @xmath24 , consists of all bijections @xmath25 , while the group homomorphism @xmath23 is @xmath26 .",
    "since the action is simply transitive , the homomorphism @xmath27 is an embedding , and we consider the @xmath3-group as a subgroup of @xmath24 via this embedding @xmath27 .    the other key character in this by now classical story is the neo - riemannian @xmath4-group , which is the subgroup of @xmath24 generated by the bijections @xmath28 .",
    "these transformations , respectively called _ parallel _ , _ leading - tone exchange _ , and _ relative _ , and are given by - tuples allows these root - free , mathematical formulations of musical operations .",
    "see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote 20 ) . ]",
    "@xmath29 for instance , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "these operations are sometimes called _ contextual inversions _ because the inversion in the definition depends on the input .",
    "note that input and output always have two pitch - classes in common , though _ their positions are reversed_. in example  [ examp : cohn_group ] , we will see how to use permutations to define variants @xmath33 which _ retain the positions of the common tones _ , and generate a dihedral group of order 24 we call the _ cohn group_. we will also see in section  [ sec : permutations ] how permutations allow us to mathematically extend @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 to triads in first inversion or second inversion .",
    "note that a naive application of the formulas in to a major triad not in root position makes no musical sense ; for instance , naive application would erroneously show that the parallel of a first inversion @xmath19-major chord @xmath34 is @xmath35 , which is an @xmath21-minor chord .",
    "the main properties of the @xmath4-group were observed by david lewin : it acts simply transitively on @xmath18 , and it consists precisely of those elements of @xmath24 which commute with the @xmath3-group .",
    "for instance @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the symmetric group on the set @xmath18 .",
    "two subgroups @xmath6 and @xmath38 of the symmetric group @xmath37 are _ dual in the sense of lewin _ if their natural actions on @xmath18 are simply transitive and each is the centralizer of the other , that is , @xmath39    for an exposition of @xmath3-@xmath4-duality , see crans  fiore  satyendra @xcite , and for its extension to length @xmath5 pitch - class segments in @xmath10 satisfying a tritone condition , see fiore  satyendra @xcite . childs and",
    "gollin both developed the relevant dihedral groups in the special case of the pitch - class segment @xmath40 , i.e. , for the set class of dominant - seventh chords and half - diminished seventh chords ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the dual group for a simply transitive action of a finite group always exists .",
    "this was pointed out in @xcite , though not proved there , so we present a proof now .",
    "let @xmath18 be a general finite set , as opposed to the specific set of pitch - class segments in section  [ subsec : duality_ti_plr ] .",
    "[ prop : dual_construction ] suppose @xmath6 is a finite group which acts simply transitively on a finite set @xmath18 .",
    "fix an element @xmath41 and consider the two embeddings @xmath42 & \\text{\\rm sym}(s)}\\\\ \\xymatrix { \\text{\\phantom{$\\lambda { \\colon\\thinspace}$ } } g \\ar@{|->}[r ] & \\big ( s \\mapsto gs\\big ) } \\end{array } \\hspace{.25 cm } \\begin{array}{c } \\xymatrix{\\rho { \\colon\\thinspace}g \\ar[r ] & \\text{\\rm sym}(s ) } \\\\ \\xymatrix@c=1.5pc{\\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad g \\ar@{|->}[r ] & \\big(hs_0 \\mapsto hg^{-1}s_0\\big ) . } \\end{array}\\ ] ] then the images @xmath43 and @xmath44 are dual groups in @xmath37 .",
    "the injection @xmath45 depends on the choice of @xmath46 , but the image @xmath44 does not .    if @xmath47 , then @xmath48 and @xmath49 commute because @xmath50 for any @xmath51 .",
    "simple transitivity of both @xmath43 and @xmath44 is fairly clear .",
    "thus , so far we have @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "recall from the orbit - stabilizer theorem that a finite group acting on a finite set acts simply if and only if it acts transitively , and in this case the cardinality of the group is the same as the cardinality of the set .",
    "we next claim that the centralizer @xmath54 acts simply on @xmath18 . if @xmath55 and @xmath56 for some single @xmath57 , then @xmath58 for all @xmath51 , which means @xmath59 and @xmath60 are equal as functions on @xmath18 .",
    "thus this centralizer acts simply and @xmath61 , and consequently the inclusion @xmath52 from above is actually an equality .",

    "if @xmath18 is a finite set , and a subgroup @xmath6 of @xmath24 acts simply transitively on @xmath18 , then the centralizer of @xmath6 in @xmath24 also acts simply transitively .",
