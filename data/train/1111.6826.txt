    "the execution of large trades in financial markets requires the balance between risks and costs .",
    "the main risk concerns the lack of availability of a counterparty , which can lead to a delay in the execution of a transaction . in order to guarantee a fast trade execution ,",
    "a trader may incur additional costs . as clarified by @xcite ,",
    "a trader faces a choice between a ` passive ' and an ` actice ' execution strategy .",
    "given this background , the available models of optimal execution assume that the trading activity of individual investors has an impact on the average price prevailing in the market .",
    "the transaction costs are characterized by parametric forms that replicate stylized facts documented in the market microstructure literature ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "almgren and chriss ( 1999 , 2000 ) and konishi and makimoto ( 2001 ) provide examples of optimal strategies for the execution problem in the stock market .",
    "their models assume that the transaction cost per share is a linear function of the number of shares of assets traded .",
    "the only source of uncertianty consists in the volatility of the stock price .",
    "@xcite suggests that the linearity assumption is largely at odds with reality .",
    "first , the average liquidity premium on stocks tends to be either a convex or a concave function of the traded size .",
    "this depends on the counterparty s perception about the reason for the trade , namely on whether it is driven by liquidity or information needs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the liquidity premium is related to the risk of finding a counterparty . in other words ,",
    "the lower the probability of finding a counterparty in the market , the higher the liquidity premium . in this paper , we review the optimal transaction strategy proposed by @xcite . we show that the solution method used by @xcite is ill - posed .",
    "the reason is that it is based on the assumption that no shares per unit of time are exchanged at the beginning of the period .",
    "we use an approach based on the gauss hypergeometric function to solve for the case of positive initial trades .",
    "our results differ strongly from those of @xcite .",
    "first of all , the problem admits a solution with no trading in the opening period only if additional parametric restrictions are imposed .",
    "second , with positive initial trading , the optimal execution time depends on trading activity in the initial period .",
    "this note is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides a selected discussion of the literature on optimal trade execution .",
    "section 3 outlines the structure of the problem .",
    "section 4 proposes a general solution method for positive initial values of the velocity .",
    "section 5 concludes .",
    "finally , in appendix a , we discuss the general method for the solution of second order differential equations with a gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "rebalancing portfolios of assets requires executing trades in the marketplace . with the advent of algorithmic trading and access availability to many alternative trading venues",
    ", investors have dedicated increasing resources to the scheduling of trades .",
    "the practical setup of the problem is rather intuitive .",
    "an investor has a target number of , say shares that it intends to sell or buy within a given time frame .",
    "the decision problem requires to compute how many shares to place or demand in the market at each point in time within the trade horizon .",
    "the aim of the investor is to minimize the execution costs .",
    "these are typically measured as the difference between the price obtained from the market and a benchmark price for the transaction .",
    "there are multiple relevant dimensions to the execution problem .",
    "several contributions have showed that the liquidity premium is time - varying .",
    "the reason is that it is determined by the availability of traders willing to act as counterparties , namely traders willing to buy or sell a given quantity of an asset at a desired price .",
    "however , as the presence of traders willing to ` take the other side ' of a trade is uncertain , any trading is characterized by execution risk .",
    "another relevant aspect is related to the fact that market illiquidity generates transaction costs .",
    "this typically takes the form of a large spread between bid and ask prices @xcite .",
    "therefore , as noticed by @xcite , the minization of transaction costs is a key aspect of the portfolio optimization problem . as documented in various studies including @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "large trades do impact market prices and , thus affecting the bid - ask spreads .",
    "asset price volatility is a source for execution risk .",
    "the reason is that it affects the probability of finding a suitable counterparty .",
    "hence , it affects the sucessfulness of a trading strategy execution .",
    "the recent literature has focused on the specific aspect of volatility , namely the increased uncertainty in execution price incurred by rapid execution of large share blocks .",
    "in fact , @xcite show that liquidity fluctuates due to intrinsic variations in market activity independently of trade size .    based on the considerations outlined earlier ,",
    "what are the properties of an ` optimal ' execution strategy ? what defines an ` optimal execution price ' ?",
    "@xcite argue that ` best ' execution can be thought of as a dynamic strategy that minimizes ` liquidation ' costs .",
    "they show that dynamic programming techniques can be used fruitfully to characterize these strategies .",
    "almgren and chriss ( 2000 ) compute optimal trajectories for trading prices that are obtained by balancing market impact costs .",
    "the optimal profiles provide a motivation for low execution speed .",
    "this results arises from the balance between the need to reduce the expected value of execution , and the need to minimize the adverse effects of market volatility .",
    "while the first factor provides a reason for slower execution , the second factor lays the ground for rapid execution .",
    "that would , in fact , reduce execution risk in the form of the variance of execution cost with respect to the benchmark price . in short ,",
    "early execution reduces execution risk , whereas a delayed execution is more geared towards minimizing execution costs .",
    "evidently the degree of investor risk aversion determines how early within the trading horizon the execution starts .",
    "the shape of the schedule instead depends on the form of the assumed market impact model .",
    "@xcite makes the assumption that the market impact of trading is a linear function of trade size . in this case",
    ", the optimality frontier representing the combinations of minimized costs and market volatility has an analytical solution .",
    "value - at - risk utility funcations are then used to select the first - best solution .",
    "this choice of utility function provides a natural testing ground for the concept of liquidity - adjusted var , which explicity considers the best trade - off between volatility risk and liquidation cost .",
    "@xcite generalizes the results of @xcite to the case of nonlinear functions for the market impact of trades . in this framework ,",
    "the assumption is that the market impact cost per share follows a power law function of the trading rate .",
    "we follow the general framework of almgren and chriss ( 2000 ) . at time",
    "@xmath0 , an investor holds @xmath1 shares of an asset . the problem is to sell these shares by by time @xmath2 .",
    "we should stress that this is the statement of a general framework .",
    "in fact , the initial size @xmath1 can either be positive or negative . in the first case",
    ", the investor needs to schedule a selling program . in the second case",
    ", the investor looks at a buying program . in this paper , for simplicity , we focus on the case @xmath3 .",
    "the execution problem consists in minizing the market impact of trades subject to both initial and terminal conditions . in mathematical terms",
    ", the model proposed by @xcite delivers the following optimization problem : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the market impact function of trades : @xmath6 the problem is to determine the optimal function @xmath7 so as to minimize a chosen cost functional . using beltrami identity ,",
