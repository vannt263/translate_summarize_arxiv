    "heavy - ion collision experiments are taking place at bnl aiming at the experimental studies of a new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma @xcite . in order to extract unambiguous signals for the qcd phase transition from the heavy - ion collision experiments , quantitative calculations directly from the first principles of qcd are indispensable . at present",
    ", the lattice qcd simulation is the only systematic method to do so .",
    "various computational techniques have been developed to study the nature of quark matter at finite temperature @xmath6 and at small chemical potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . from intensive studies for the isosymmetric case @xmath9 , it turned out that accurate zero - temperature simulations are important to set the scale to achieve high precision results at finite @xmath10 and @xmath4 .",
    "most of the lattice qcd studies at finite @xmath4 so far have been performed using staggered - type quark actions with the fourth - root trick for the quark determinant .",
    "however , the fourth - root trick makes the theory non - local and thus the universality arguments fragile .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the staggered - type quarks for two - favor qcd does not show the scaling properties at finite @xmath10 expected from the three - dimensional o(4 ) spin model @xcite .",
    "this may suggest large lattice artifacts to the results of staggered - type quarks near the transition point .",
    "moreover , problems in the staggered quark formulation at finite density are pointed out in @xcite . since the theoretical base for the fourth - root trick is not clear , it is indispensable to carry out simulations adopting different lattice quark actions to control and estimate systematic errors due to the lattice discretization .",
    "several years ago , the cp - pacs collaboration has studied finite - temperature qcd using the clover - improved wilson quark action coupled with the rg - improved iwasaki action for gluons @xcite . with two flavors of dynamical quarks , the phase structure , the transition temperature and the equation of state",
    "have been investigated .",
    "in contrast to the case of the staggered - type quarks , both the standard wilson quark action @xcite and the clover - improved wilson quark action @xcite reproduce the expected universality around the critical point of the chiral phase transition : the subtracted chiral condensate shows the scaling behavior with the critical exponents and scaling function of the three - dimensional o(4 ) spin model . moreover , extensive calculations of major physical quantities such as the light hadron masses have been carried out at @xmath11 using the same action @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is worth revisiting this action armed with recent techniques for finite @xmath4 .    in the @xmath12 plane",
    ", phenomenological studies suggest the existence of a critical point at which the first order phase transition line separating the hadronic phase and the quark - gluon - plasma phase terminates @xcite .",
    "because the critical point has second order characteristics , the fluctuation of the net quark number will diverge as we approach to the critical point in the @xmath13 plane , while the fluctuation in the isospin number will remain finite @xcite .",
    "such hadronic fluctuations may be experimentally examined in heavy - ion collisions by an event - by - event analysis .",
    "the bielefeld - swansea collaboration reported lattice results for the quark number susceptibility ( the second derivative of the thermodynamic grand canonical potential @xmath14 , which is proportional to the pressure of the system ) by the taylor expansion method using a p4-improved staggered quark action @xcite : from a calculation of the taylor expansion coefficients of @xmath15 up to @xmath16 $ ] , they found that the quark number fluctuation increases rapidly as @xmath4 increases in the region near the transition temperature .",
    "this suggests indirectly the existence of the nearby critical point in the @xmath13 plane .",
    "moreover , 2 + 1 flavor simulations in staggered quarks with almost physical quark masses have recently been performed and the same behaviors in the fluctuations have been found at finite density @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to confirm the result using the wilson - type quarks .    in this paper , we study thermodynamic properties of qcd at finite temperature and density with two flavors of clover - improved wilson quarks coupled with the rg - improved iwasaki gluons .",
    "the simulations are performed along lines of constant physics corresponding to the pion and rho meson mass ratio , @xmath17 and 0.80 at @xmath11 .",
    "we calculate the taylor coefficients for the pressure in terms of @xmath18 up to the fourth order , and study the quark number and isospin susceptibilities at finite @xmath4 .",
    "since the odd derivatives vanish at @xmath19 , the fourth derivative is the leading contribution to the @xmath4-dependence of susceptibilities .",
    "we find that wilson - type quarks require much more statistics than staggered - type quarks to obtain the susceptibilities with a comparable quality . to overcome this problem",
    ", we introduce a couple of tricks in the evaluation of the taylor expansion coefficients .",
    "furthermore , we adopt a hybrid method of taylor expansion and spectral reweighting in which @xmath15 for the reweighting is approximated by a truncated taylor expansion @xcite .",
    "since the applicable range of the reweighting method is narrow due to the sign problem , we introduce the gaussian method proposed in @xcite . using these techniques",
    ", we compute the quark number density and the susceptibility in a relatively wide range of @xmath18 , and compare the results with those with staggered - type quarks .",
    "we also extend our previous study of heavy - quark free energies in various color channels at @xmath19 @xcite to finite @xmath4 . at @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the pseudo - critical temperature",
    ", we calculate the taylor expansion coefficients for the heavy - quark free energies between a static quark ( @xmath22 ) and an antiquark ( @xmath23 ) and those between @xmath22 and @xmath22 , for all color channels up to the second order in @xmath18 . by comparing the expansion coefficients of the free energies , we find that the inter - quark interaction between @xmath22 and @xmath23 becomes weaker , whereas that between @xmath22 and @xmath22 becomes stronger as @xmath4 increases .",
    "the expansion coefficients of the effective running coupling @xmath24 and the debye screening mass @xmath25 are also extracted by fitting the numerical results with a screened coulomb form ; we find that the heavy - quark free energies are well reproduced by the channel dependent casimir factor and the channel independent @xmath24 and @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "magnitude of the second order coefficient of @xmath25 does not agree with that of the leading - order calculation in the thermal perturbation theory .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : simu ] , we summarize our lattice action and simulation parameters , and determine the pseudo - critical temperature . in sec .  [ sec : eostay ] , we calculate the taylor expansion coefficients of the thermodinamic grand canonical potenital in terms of the quark chemical potentials @xmath7 and @xmath8 and evaluate them for the isosymmetric case @xmath27 at @xmath19 up to @xmath28 . in sec .",
