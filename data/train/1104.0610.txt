    "<S> two solitons placed side - by - side at rest coalesce to form a stable bound soliton molecule due to dipolar attraction .    </S>",
    "<S> a bright soliton is a self - reinforcing solitary wave that maintains its shape , while traveling at constant speed , due to a cancellation of nonlinear attraction and dispersive effects . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , bright matter - wave solitons and soliton trains were created in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath0li @xcite and @xmath1rb atoms @xcite by turning the atomic interaction attractive from repulsive using a feshbach resonance ( fr ) @xcite and releasing the bec in an axially free or an expulsive trap .    lately , a bec of @xmath2cr atoms with a large long - range dipolar interaction has been made @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to study the dipolar bec ( dbec ) with variable short - range interaction @xcite using a fr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dbec has many distinct features @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of a dbec depends not only on the scattering length , but also on the trap geometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a disk - shaped trap gives a repulsive dipolar interaction and the dbec is more stable . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a cigar - shaped trap yields an attractive dipolar interaction and hence may favor a collapse @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> collapse instability of solitons in the nonpolynomial schrdinger equation with dipole - dipole interactions was studied by gligori _ </S>",

    "<S> the controllable short - range interaction with the exotic dipolar interaction makes the dbec an interesting system for soliton generation in the cigar configuration due to added _ dipolar attraction _ and a challenging system for theoretical investigation @xcite to study the interplay between the dipolar and short - range interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest cigar - shaped bright and vortex solitons @xcite for _ repulsive _ short - range interaction in a dbec free to move along the axial direction and trapped in the radial direction , using the three - dimensional ( 3d ) gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , and study their statics and dynamics . </S>",

    "<S> santos @xcite studied stable two - dimensional ( 2d ) bright solitons in a disk - shaped dbec free to move in the radial plane and trapped in the axial direction . </S>",
    "<S> these solitons were later generalized to 2d vortex solitons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there has also been study of anisotropic 2d solitons not requiring the sign - reversal of the dipolar interaction @xcite . however , special conditions are needed to prepare these 2d solitons , whereas the present one - dimensional ( 1d ) solitons can be formed under very general conditions and hence , are of greater experimental interest . </S>",
