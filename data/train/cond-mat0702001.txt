    "the natural precession of the magnetic moment always occurs in the counterclockwise direction ( when viewed from above ) .",
    "therefore , its deterministic dynamics in the up and down states differ.@xcite for this reason the stochastic dynamics and thus the mfpts in these states are different as well . in turn",
    ", the difference in the mfpts can drastically change the magnetic properties of systems composed of nanoparticles .",
