    "hamiltonian eigenvalue problems have a time - honored history , as they arise in numerous applications stemming from fluid mechanics , celestial mechanics , optical and atomic physics among many other disciplines ; see for some recent examples the books  @xcite . especially in higher dimensional settings these problems can rapidly become fairly computationally intractable , at least as concerns providing the full diagonalization of the relevant matrix ( e.g. , when it stems from the linearization around two - dimensional vortex structures or three - dimensional vortex - rings  @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to be able to reduce the dimensionality of the calculation by providing a technique that can capture the main features of the linearization spectrum through suitable reductions to a finite dimensional eigenvalue problem .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to provide a general overview , as well as a systematic set of case examples of such a method .",
    "the approach that will be developed will be based on the so - called krein matrix  @xcite .",
    "the krein matrix is a meromorphic matrix - valued function constructed via a lyapunov - schmidt reduction , and consequently recasts the infinite - dimensional eigenvalues problem as a finite - dimensional one .",
    "the construction is such that the eigenvalues are realized as points for which the krein matrix is singular .",
    "the computation and visualization of the determinant of this matrix can serve as a tool to identify the eigenvalues of the original problem .    when determining the spectrum for the hamiltonian eigenvalue problem , there are two spectral sets to consider : those with positive real part , and those with negative krein index ( signature ) .",
    "the latter eigenvalues are purely imaginary ; however , upon collision with eigenvalues of positive krein signature it will generically be the case that a hamiltonian - hopf bifurcation will occur , which leads to an oscillatory instability .",
    "while the eigenvalues with positive real part are easy to visually identify , an additional calculation is necessary in order to identify the signature of a purely imaginary eigenvalue .",
    "as we will see later in this paper , the krein matrix is constructed in such a manner that the eigenvalues with negative signature can be identified _",
    "graphically_. consequently , all of the ( potentially ) unstable eigenvalues can be identified visually .",
    "a related question is : how many ( potentially ) unstable eigenvalues are there to locate ? for a given problem it may be theoretically possible to establish an upper bound on the real part of all eigenvalues ; however , in many problems of interest there is no upper bound on the imaginary part of the eigenvalue .",
    "the hamiltonian - krein index , which will be discussed in detail later in this paper , counts the number of eigenvalues with positive real part , as well as the number of purely imaginary eigenvalues with negative krein signature . in the problems presented in this paper",
    "this index will be finite , and it will be related to the number of negative directions of the constrained second variation of the energy ( the underlying wave is realized as a critical point of the constrained energy ) .",
    "thus , while no bound is present on the imaginary part of all of the eigenvalues , since there are only a finite number of ( potentially ) unstable eigenvalues , there will be an upper bound for this set .",
    "a theoretical determination of this bound is probably not possible ; however , it can be determined numerically through the krein matrix .    the computation of the krein matrix in this paper will be numerical for each case study .",
    "unfortunately , at this point in time we do not know of any examples for which the krein matrix can be explicitly computed .",
    "our hope is that for special problems , e.g. , the nonlinear schrdinger equation with the 1-soliton potential , such a calculation may be possible",
    ". this will be the topic of future research .",
    "we note that there is reason to be optimistic that this will be a fruitful direction for research , in that it is possible in some special cases to explicitly construct the evans function ( another eigenvalue counting tool ) , e.g. , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters  9.3 and 10.4 ) and the references therein .    our presentation will be structured as follows . in , we first provide an overview of the hamiltonian - krein index theory for hamiltonian eigenvalue problems .",
    "afterwards , we focus on the construction of the krein matrix and provide a summary of its properties .",
    "in we consider specific examples stemming from the application of the krein matrix analysis to vortex dynamical states that are of intense recent interest in the field of atomic physics .",
    "in particular , we consider single ( unit charge ) vortex states that are presently fairly routine to produce / observe  @xcite , but also examine the case of the recently studied vortex dipoles . for the sake of completeness , we also examine in one - dimensional analogs of such vortex states ; namely , multi - dark soliton structures that have been studied theoretically ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) and also have been observed experimentally in  @xcite .",
    "finally , in we summarize our findings and present our conclusions , as well as some potential topics for future study .",
    "regarding the states studied in , it is known that the precessional dynamics of a single vortex is connected with the negative krein signature eigenvalues of the corresponding linearization spectrum , see @xcite .",
    "the vortex dipoles were produced by dynamical experiments involving flow past an obstacle  @xcite , or quenching through the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) transition  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , their dynamical properties and structural robustness were studied in considerable length in recent works in the physical literature @xcite .",
    "experimental works on this theme - especially , @xcite - were concerned with issues such as :    1 .   the equilibrium configuration , which is also explored herein ; 2 .   the epicyclic motion around this equilibrium , which was analyzed through the negative krein signature eigenvalues of the dipole s linearization spectrum .",
    "it should be noted in passing that the study of spectral stability properties in bec settings ( and particularly for single- and multi - charge vortices ) is a subject rapidly gaining momentum , as evidenced by the recent work of @xcite on the subject .",

    "the details for the following discussion can be found in , e.g. , @xcite , and an abbreviated version is included here for the sake of completeness .",

    "now , the symmetries generate conserved quantities , and it turns out to be the case the manner in which these quantities are generated allows us to solve @xmath21 for each @xmath22 : denote these solutions as @xmath23 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . if we set @xmath26 as @xmath27 then by the fredholm alternative it will be the case that @xmath28 if and only if @xmath29 is nonsingular : this will henceforth be assumed .    in @xmath30",

    "thus , it will be important not to calculate @xmath12 , but instead @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the orthogonal projection .",
    "it was most recently shown in @xcite that @xmath39 thus , the matrix @xmath29 also plays a significant role in determining the number of negative eigenvalues for the constrained operator .",

    "<S> . these latter eigenvalues have the property that they can become unstable upon collision with other purely imaginary eigenvalues , i.e. , they are a necessary building block in the mechanism leading to the so - called hamiltonian - hopf bifurcation . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we review a general theory for constructing a meromorphic matrix - valued function , the so - called krein matrix , which has the property of not only locating the unstable eigenvalues , but also those with negative krein signature . </S>",
    "<S> these eigenvalues are realized as zeros of the determinant . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting finite dimensional problem obtained by setting the determinant of the krein matrix to zero presents a valuable simplification . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> the usefulness of the technique is illustrated through prototypical examples of spectral analysis of states that have arisen in recent experimental and theoretical studies of atomic bose - einstein condensates . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider one - dimensional settings ( the cigar trap ) possessing real - valued multi - dark - soliton solutions , and two - dimensional settings ( the pancake trap ) admitting complex multi - vortex stationary waveforms . </S>"
