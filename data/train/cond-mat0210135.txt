    "the existence of the dynamic phase transition for such a system and its nature have been thoroughly studied using extensive monte - carlo simulations .",

    "all the studies with pulsed field were made below @xmath0 , the static critical temperature ( without any field ) , where the system gets ordered .",
    "a ` positive ' pulse is one which is applied along the direction of prevalent order , while the ` negative ' one is applied opposite to that .",
    "the results for the positive pulse case did not involve any new thermodynamic scale @xcite . in the negative pulse case , however , interesting features were observed @xcite : the negative field pulse competes with the existing order , and the system makes a transition from one ordered state characterised by an equilibrium magnetisation @xmath1 ( say ) to the other equivalent ordered state with equilibrium magnetisation @xmath2 depending on the temperature @xmath3 , field strength @xmath4 and its duration @xmath5 .",
    "this transion is well studied in the limit @xmath6 for any non - zero value of @xmath4 at any @xmath7 .",
    "this transition , for the general cases of finite @xmath5 , is called here ` magnetisation - reversal ' transition",
    ". some aspects of this transition has been recently studied extensively @xcite .",
