    "the infrared astronomy satellite mission ( iras ) @xcite successfully performed the first all - sky survey at infrared wavelengths , providing many fruitful results . after this pioneering mission over two decades ago , the akari satellite ( previously known as astro - f ) @xcite is performing the next generation all - sky survey primarily with the fis ( far - infrared surveyor ) focal plane instrument in 4 far - ir bands ( 50200 @xmath0 m range ) to improved spatial resolutions and wider wavelength coverage than the its predecessor iras [ see @xcite for detailed specifications and hardware performance of the fis instrument ] .    although the telescope apertures of iras ( 60 cm ) and akari ( 68.5 cm ) are similar , the effective beam size of the akari mission ( 0.5@xmath1 @xmath2 0.9@xmath1 ) is much smaller than that of iras ( 2@xmath1 @xmath2 5@xmath1 ) because the sizes of the detector pixels in iras were much larger than the size of the diffracted beam of the telescope . due to this relatively large beam size",
    ", the astronomical observations made in the far - ir bands of the iras mission were presumed to have been affected by the fluctuation noise arising from both background structures and many overlapping extragalactic point sources below the resolution of the beam . as the resolution of the telescope / instrument beam increases ,",
    "the measurements of point source fluxes are less prone to the fluctuation noises .",
    "thus , fluctuation noise needs to be more carefully treated for accurate extraction of sources and flux measurements [ see jeong et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) for realistic estimations of these noises for the akari mission ] . from observations of sources for those with iras fluxes made during the performance verification ( pv ) phase of the akari",
    ", we investigate how the resolved background near a point source can affect the measurement of fluxes by comparing the measured fluxes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ass_akari ] , we describe the data and the data reduction .",
    "we present the comparison of our results between iras flux and akari flux in section [ sec : comp_flux ] .",
    "the probable detections of new akari sources are explained in section [ sec : new_akari ] .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the data used in this work are from akari all - sky survey observations performed during the two week - long pv phase from april 24th 2006 to may 7th 2006 .",
    "the observations cover a range in galactic latitude between -50@xmath3 to 50@xmath3 as shown in figure [ fig : scanmap_pv ] .",
    "( 90 mm , 80mm)fig01a.ps ( 90 mm , 80mm)fig01b.ps    for the data processing , we have used the latest pipeline developed for the all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "the source extraction was performed only for the akari wide - s band ( 90@xmath0 m ) with the dedicated software for the akari survey . on the purpose of calibrating the absolute flux ,",
    "the observations of asteroids , stars and galaxies with a wide range of fluxes were used , and the uncertainty of flux calibration is expected to be less than 20% for wide - s band @xcite . in order to avoid false detections , we removed any detections near the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) region , reset or calibration sequences and the edge of a detector array . among the extracted sources , we have selected reliable sources with the following criteria to eliminate false detections : ( 1 ) signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) greater than 15 , ( 2 ) detected in all rows of the detector array , e.g. , 3 rows of detector pixels for the wide - s band , and ( 3 ) confirmed in at least two more orbit ( @xmath4 100 min . per 1 orbit for akari ) ( 4 ) the galactic plane region is excluded as it is observed in a special detector readout mode that needs separate processing [ for the sampling mode of akari observation , see @xcite for detailed information ] . after selecting reliable sources",
    ", we attempted to match them with iras sources within a positional error circle of 100@xmath5 .",
    "the total number of sources in our final selected sample is 150 .",
    "we showed the positional difference between akari and iras sources with a good flux quality in figure [ fig : pos_diff_det ] .",
    "most of positions for iras sources are well consistent with those estimated in akari within a resolution range ( 30@xmath5 ) . the current position information is determined based on the sensors of the onboard attitude and orbit control system ( aocs ) , reprocessed on the ground .",
    "the major source of uncertainty is the alignment between the aocs sensors and the telescope , and its time variation . in the future",
    ", position information will be improved with the pointing reconstruction processing using the data from the focal - plane instruments .",
    "the accuracy of the detected source position will be as good as a few arcsec , which enable us to carry out more detailed analysis of the ` iras ' positions .",
    "figure [ fig : pos_det_el ] shows the distribution of these sources in ecliptic coordinates .",
    "( 90 mm , 90mm)fig02.ps    ( 130 mm , 80mm)fig03.ps",
    "the reliably detected sources are used to compare the iras and akari fluxes .",
    "the effective wavelength of the akari wide - s band is 90@xmath0 m while iras has 60@xmath0 m and 100@xmath0 m bands in the far - ir region . in order to make a consistent comparison between the akari and iras fluxes , we computed the iras flux at 90@xmath0 m by fitting the 60 and 100 @xmath0 m data to a black - body curve . since the flux densities of iras point sources listed in the catalogue are non - color corrected ones , we attempted an iterative fitting method which performs successively fitting and color corrections .",
    "we also applied the color correction to the akari flux densities .",
    "figure [ fig : comp_flux ] shows the comparison between the akari and iras fluxes of our detected sources at 90@xmath0 m .",
    "we also plot the error bars for the iras and akari fluxes .",
    "note that a flux error for an akari flux was obtained from the standard deviation of the extracted fluxes for orbit - confirmed detections while the flux error for the iras sources with a bad flux quality was not listed in iras point source catalogue .",
    "the straight line shows the perfect correlation between these two fluxes .",
    "the size of the circle is proportional to the estimated signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this figure shows that the data lies below the envelope of @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the akari fluxes are in general similar to or smaller than the iras fluxes .",
    "( 130 mm , 130mm)fig04.ps    such a trend is more clearly shown in figure [ fig : comp_flux_ratio ] which displays the flux ratio of iras to akari detections .",
    "we checked the quality of the iras flux , by examining the quality flag for the deviating sources .",
    "most of those sources indeed have a moderate or a bad flux quality and are often located near the galactic plane or strong star formation regions ( e.g. , large magellanic cloud ) .",
    "thus , due to a strong background , the flux of iras sources with moderate or bad flux quality flags may not have been accurately estimated .",
    "we also found that the flux is over or underestimated even for iras sources with a high flux quality .",
    "the scattering trend in flux ratio shows a triangular shape ( peaking at 80 jy ) in the upper panel of figure [ fig : comp_flux_ratio ] and a right triangular shape in the lower panel of figure [ fig : comp_flux_ratio ] , respectively . the sensitivity of akari in the low flux range is better than that of iras , which explains that the scatter in the lower panel of figure [ fig : comp_flux_ratio ] is larger for low fluxes than for high fluxes .",
    "( 120 mm , 120mm)fig05a.ps ( 120 mm , 120mm)fig05b.ps      the background fluctuations from the surface brightness of extended structure , can easily be mistaken for genuine point sources . since our detections are for bright sources , the contribution of the fluctuation noise will be primarily from sky confusion ( rather than point sources ) .",
    "some authors have estimated the sky confusion from background fluctuations for the akari mission based upon iras and iso data @xcite . in order to check any dependency of the flux uncertainty on the background level , we plot flux ratios as a function of the background emission in figure [ fig : comp_flux_bgr ] .",
    "we assume that the fluctuations from the background are mainly from cirrus emission .",
    "the fluctuations from the zodiacal light is expected to be small at the resolution of the iras mission . for the estimation of the cirrus emission in the akari band , we used the all - sky 100 @xmath0 m dust map generated from the iras and cobe data by schlegel , finkbeiner , and davis ( 1998 ) and the dust model by finkbeiner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . as shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : comp_flux_bgr ] , the scatter increases around the 20 mjy / sr level , with an underlying monotonic increase from 20 to 200 mjy / sr .",
    "owing to its higher resolution , akari can resolve the background more effectively .",
    "since the estimated background for iras depends on the relatively larger spatial structure of the background compared to the diffracted beam size [ the source extraction for iras used an annulus of radius 5@xmath7@xmath27@xmath7 in measuring the background @xcite ] , it could not be measured properly on a intensively fluctuating background .",
    "therefore , this trend shows that the local background at least below 5@xmath7 near a source , rather than the global background , is an important factor in the flux estimation .",
    "note that previous estimations of sky confusion @xcite suggested that the fluctuation noise is strongly dependent on the background level with the assumption that the spatial power spectrum from fluctuations of the dust emission has a simple power - law with the power index of @xmath4 - 3 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have also made a simple estimation of the contamination of the flux by summing the background flux over a detector pixel .",
    "we plot the case for a 10 jy iras source contaminated by a 10 percent background ( see the dotted line in figure [ fig : comp_flux_bgr ] ) .",
    "we found that the flux measurements for some iras sources might be contaminated by the background .",
    "if we plot akari sources matched with iras sources with only high flux quality flags ( see the lower panel of figure [ fig : comp_flux_bgr ] ) , the scatter is reduced , however , visible scatter still remains and slightly increases as the cirrus background becomes larger .",
    "thus , iras flux measurements may have errors even for correctly measured iras sources with a high flux quality . for a more systematic study to confirm this result",
    ", we need to use samples from a wider survey area .",
    "( 120 mm , 120mm)fig06a.ps ( 120 mm , 120mm)fig06b.ps",
    "in this work , we have used only sources matched with iras point source catalogue .",
    "however , we also detected new sources from the akari all - sky survey which are not present in the iras catalogue .",
    "there are many possible candidates for these new akari sources .",
    "first , one iras source may have been resolved into two sources ( see one example shown in figure [ fig : det_new_akari ] ) .",
    "second , some sources may be resolved from the background .",
    "third , the source may be a solar system object , e.g. , asteroid .",
    "fourth , some detections may be false due to the detector characteristics .",
    "on the other hand , there may be false detections from iras .",
    "thus , we expect that the akari all - sky survey can find new extragalactic point sources as well as faint galactic point sources .",
    "( 70 mm , 70mm)fig07a.ps ( 70 mm , 70mm)fig07b.ps ( 70 mm , 70mm)fig07c.ps",
    "by using the akari all - sky survey data taken during the pv phase , we tried to extract reliably detected sources and compared their fluxes with associations in the iras point source catalogue .",
    "the positions of iras sources are mostly well consistent with those estimated from akari .",
    "we found that the original flux measurements of some iras sources appear to have been overestimated or underestimated .",
    "we also confirmed that most of the iras sources with a moderate or a bad quality flux flag in the iras catalogue were quite overestimated . to investigate any possible contamination of the iras source flux from the background in the estimation of the flux",
    ", we checked the background level on each detection of the iras sources .",
    "the difference in the flux between the iras and akari associations was not found to be strongly dependent on the background level .",
    "however , it is suggested that the flux measurement may have been affected by the local background rather than the global background . note that akari can resolve the background and source more effectively than iras due to the higher resolution of the akari observations . in addition",
    ", we found that in some cases , the flux measurements even for correctly measured ( high flux quality ) iras sources may include errors of up to @xmath45 , even though we consider the uncertainty of flux calibration .",
    "however , due to various detector characteristics , there may be false detections as well as detections with inaccurately estimated flux though we have removed false detections and selected reliable detections as described in section [ sec : ass_akari ] .",
    "the akari all - sky survey is expected both to verify the iras sources and find new extragalactic or galactic point sources .",
    "the preliminary catalogue for reliably detected point sources will be released in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the akari project is an infrared mission of the japan space exploration agency ( jaxa ) institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) , and is carried out with the participation of mainly the following institutes ; nagoya university , the university of tokyo , national astronomical observatory japan , the european space agency ( esa ) , imperial college london , university of sussex , the open university ( uk ) , university of groningen / sron ( the netherlands ) , seoul national university ( korea ) .",
    "the far - infrared detectors were developed under collaboration with the national institute of information and communications technology .",
