    "there is a common recognition today that the standard ( lighthouse ) model of inclined rotator , lying at the base of current understanding of radio pulsars , faces serious difficulties in explaining the long - periodic ( @xmath0 s ) pulsed radiation of soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anamalous @xmath1-ray pulsars ( axps ) .",
    "the persistent @xmath1-ray luminosity of axp / sgr sources ( @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) is appreciably ( 10 - 100 times ) larger than expected from a neutron star deriving radiation power from the energy of rotation with frequency of detected pulses .",
    "such an understanding has come soon after the detection on march 5 , 1979 of the first 0.2 second long gamma burst @xcite which followed by a 200-seconds emission that showed a clear 8-second pulsation period @xcite and association of this event to a supernova remnant known as n49 in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "this object is very young ( only a few thousand years old ) but period of pulsating emission is typical of a much older neutron star . in works",
    "@xcite it has been proposed that discovered object , today designated sgr 0526 - 66 , is a vibrating neutron star , that is , the detected for the first time long - periodic pulses owe their origin to the neutron star vibrations , rather than rotation as is the case radio pulsars . during the following decades",
    ", the study of these objects has been guided by idea @xcite that electromagnetic activity of magnetars both axp s and sgr s , is primarily determined by decay of ultra strong magnetic field ( @xmath4 g ) and that a highly intensive gamma bursts are manifestation of magnetar quakes @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate in some details the model of vibration powered magnetar which is in line with the current treatment of quasi - periodic oscillations of outburst luminosity of soft gamma repeaters as being produced by lorentz - force - driven torsional seismic vibrations triggered by quake . as an extension of this point of view , in this paper we focus on impact of the magnetic field decay on alfvn vibrations and magneto - dipole radiation generated by such vibrations . before so doing",
    ", it seems appropriate to recall a seminal paper of woltjer @xcite who was first to observe that magnetic - flux - conserving core - collapse supernova can produce a neutron star with the above magnetic field intensity of typical magnetar .",
    "based on this observation , hoyle , narlikar and wheeler @xcite proposed that a strongly magnetized neutron star can generate magneto - dipole radiation powered by energy of hydromagnetic , alfvn , vibrations stored in the star after its birth in supernova event ( see , also , @xcite ) .",
    "some peculiarities of this mechanism of vibration powered radiation has been scrutinized in our recent work @xcite , devoted to radiative activity of pulsating magnetic white dwarfs , in which it was found that necessary condition for the energy conversion from alfvn vibrations into electromagnetic radiation is the decay of magnetic field . as was stressed , the magnetic field decay is one of the most conspicuous features distinguishing magnetars from normal rotation powered pulsars .",
    "it seems not implausible , therefore , to expect that at least some of currently monitoring axp / sgr - like sources are magnatars deriving power of pulsating magneto - dipole radiation from energy of alfvnic vibrations of highly conducting matter in the ultra strong magnetic field experiencing decay .    in approaching alfvn vibrations of neutron star in its own time - evolving magnetic field ,",
    "we rely on the results of recent investigations @xcite of both even parity poloidal and odd parity toroidal ( according to chandrasekhar terminology @xcite ) node - free alfvn vibrations of magnetars in constant - in - time magnetic field .",
    "the extensive review of earlier investigations of standing - wave regime of alfvnic stellar vibrations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the spectral formula for discrete frequencies of both poloidal and toroidal @xmath5-modes in a neutron star with mass @xmath6 , radius @xmath7 and magnetic field of typical magnetar , @xmath8 g , reads @xmath9 where numerical factor @xmath10 is unique to each specific shape of magnetic field frozen in the neutron star of one and the same mass @xmath6 and radius @xmath7 .",
    "in above cited work it was shown that lorentz - force - driven shear node - free vibrations of magnetar in its own magnetic field field @xmath11 can be properly described in terms of material displacements @xmath12 obeying equation of magneto - solid - mechanics @xmath13]\\times { \\bf b }   ( { \\bf r},t)\\\\   \\label{e2.2 }   & & { \\dot { \\bf u}}({\\bf      r},t)=[\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\omega$}({\\bf r},t)\\times { \\bf r}],\\quad      \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\omega$ }    ( { \\bf r},t)=a_t[\\nabla\\chi(r)]\\,{\\dot\\alpha}(t ) .    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the field @xmath14 is identical to that for torsion node - free vibrations restored by hooke s force of elastic stresses @xcite with @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nodeless function of distance from the star center and @xmath17 is legendre polynomial of degree @xmath18 specifying the overtone of toroidal mode . in ( [ e2.2 ] ) ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath19 is the basic dynamical variable describing time evolution of vibrations which is different for each specific overtone ; in what follows we confine our analysis to solely one quadrupole overtone .",
    "the central to the subject of our study is the following representation of the time - evolving internal magnetic field @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the time - dependent intensity and @xmath22 is dimensionless vector - function of the field distribution over the star volume .",
    "scalar product of ( [ e1.1 ] ) with the separable form of material displacements @xmath23 followed by integration over the star volume leads to equation for amplitude @xmath24 having the form of equation of oscillator with time - depended spring constant @xmath25 the total vibration energy and frequency are given by @xmath26 it follows @xmath27 this shows that the variation in time of magnetic field intensity in quaking magnetar causes variation in the vibration energy . in next section we focus on conversion of energy of lorentz - force - driven seismic vibrations of magnetar into the energy of magneto - dipole radiation .",
    "the point of departure in the study of vibration - energy powered magneto - dipole emission of the star ( whose radiation power , @xmath28 , is given by larmor s formula ) is the equation @xmath29 we consider a model of quaking neutron star whose torsional magneto - mechanical oscillations are accompanied by fluctuations of total magnetic moment preserving its initial ( in seismically quiescent state ) direction : @xmath30 .",
    "the total magnetic dipole moment should execute oscillations with frequency @xmath31 equal to that for magneto - mechanical vibrations of stellar matter which are described by equation for @xmath24 .",
    "this means that @xmath32 and @xmath24 must obey equations of similar form , namely @xmath33 it is easy to see that equations ( [ e3.5 ] ) and ( [ e3.6 ] ) can be reconciled if @xmath34 given this , we arrive at the following law of magnetic field decay @xmath35 the last equation shows the lifetime of quake - induced vibrations in question substantially depends upon the intensity of initial ( before quake ) magnetic field @xmath36 : the larger @xmath36 the shorter @xmath37 . for neutron stars with one and the same mass @xmath38 and radius @xmath39 km , and magnetic field of typical pulsar @xmath40 g",

    ", one has @xmath76 g. thus , the substantial physical difference between vibration and rotation powered neutron star models is that in the former model the elongation of pulse period is attributed to magnetic field decay , whereas in the latter one the period lengthening is ascribed to the slow down of rotation @xcite .",
    "the last two decades have seen a growing understanding that magnetic field decay is the key property distinguishing magnetars from pulsars .",
    "the magnetic fields frozen - in the immobile matter of pulsars ( most of which are fairly stable to starquakes ) operate like a passive ( unaltered in time ) promoter of their persistent radiation along the axis of dipole magnetic moment of the star inclined to the rotation axis .",
    "the presented treatment of spin - down effect emphasizes kinematic nature of time evolution of pulsar magnetic moment as brought about by rapid rotation with gradually decreasing frequency and showing that rotation does not affect intensity of its internal magnetic field . unlike pulsars , magnetars ( sgr - like sources ) are isolated quaking neutron stars whose seismic and radiative activity is thought to be dominated by decay of magnetic field .",
    "perhaps the most striking manifest of seismic vibrations of magnetar are quasi - periodic oscillations of outburst luminosity rapidly decreasing ( in several hundred seconds ) from about @xmath77 erg s@xmath3 in giant flare to about @xmath78 erg s@xmath3 in quiescent regime of long - periodic x - ray emission . as was emphasized , this lowest value of luminosity is well above of the rate of energy of rotation with period equal to that of detected emission . with all above in mind",
    ", we have set up a model of vibration powered radiation of quaking magnetar in which the key role is attributed to magnetic field decay .",
    "the most striking outcome of presented line of argument is gradual decrease of frequencies ( lengthening of periods ) of magneto - dipole radiation ( pulsating with the frequency of toroidal @xmath5-mode of seismic vibrations ) owing its origin to magnetic field decay . remarkably that this prediction of the model is consistent with data on gradual decrease of frequency of pulsed @xmath1- ray emission of such magnetars as 1e 2259.1 + 586 @xcite and xte j1810 - 197 @xcite .",
    "it is hoped , therefore , that presented here theoretical results can be efficiently utilized as a guide in observational quest for vibration powered neutron stars .",
