    "the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations  @xcite give a strong hint in favor of an early period of inflation  @xcite in the history of the universe .",
    "inflation is an attractive scenario as it allows us to avoid the difficulties which plague the standard hot big bang theory , _ e.g.  _ the flatness and the horizon problems .",
    "moreover , when combined with quantum mechanics , inflation can also give rise to a satisfactory model for structure formation , see refs .  @xcite .",
    "as a matter of fact , inflation implies that the power spectrum of the cosmological perturbations should be ( almost ) scale invariant  @xcite , a prediction which has been known for a long time to be in good agreement with the astrophysical data .",
    "in fact , the data are now so accurate that one can start probing the details of the inflationary scenario .",
    "for instance , the small deviation from scale invariance in the power spectrum predicted by inflation ( for density perturbations and for gravitational waves ) directly encodes the underlying high energy physics responsible for the phase of accelerated expansion  @xcite implying that the model building issue for inflation is meaningful  @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned observations and the endeavor to better understand space  like singularities like the big - bang have sparked a renewed interest in cosmological models based on string theory and/or supergravity  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "alternatives to inflation have also been studied like , for instance , the pre big - bang scenario  @xcite or the ekpyrotic model  @xcite , but so far no scenario has been as successful as inflation .",
    "hence , finding a satisfactory inflationary scenario from the most recent ideas in string theory is an important challenge  @xcite .",
    "in all these attempts , our universe is pictured as a moving brane embedded in a compactification space .",
    "the acceleration of the universe is caused by the motion of the brane  @xcite . at the level of the four dimensional effective description obtained after compactification , the theory results in particular supergravity models .",
    "then , in general , two main issues must be addressed in order to obtain a satisfactory scenario .",
    "the first problem is to obtain a sufficiently flat potential .",
    "one of the crucial stumbling blocks of f ",
    "term inflation in supergravity is the presence of large @xmath1 corrections ( where @xmath2 is the hubble parameter during inflation ) to the inflaton mass , which spoil the flatness of the inflaton potential . in order to lead to realistic models , the string ",
    "inspired scenarios for inflation must overcome this problem .",
    "another highly conspicuous problem is the stabilization issue . in string inflation , the 10dimensional type iib theory is compactified on a calabi - yau manifold .",
    "calabi - yau compactifications lead to two types of moduli fields describing the khler and complex structure deformations .",
    "there is also another scalar degree of freedom originating from the 10dimensional dilaton .",
    "now all these moduli fields need to be stabilized in order to guarantee the flatness of the inflaton potential , i.e. no runaway behavior in the moduli directions .",
    "different solutions to the above - mentioned questions have been proposed . in particular , it has been noted recently that one can obtain flat enough potentials by requiring that a shift symmetry @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a real constant , is a symmetry of the khler potential , later broken mildly .",
    "this is particularly natural within the low energy description of brane dynamics emerging from string theory  @xcite . on the other hand , for the stabilization question",
    ", the complex structure moduli and the dilaton can be generically stabilized when fluxes are turned on .",
    "this leaves only the khler moduli as flat directions .",
    "the khler moduli can be also stabilized once strong coupling effects , such as gaugino condensation , take place on a stack of @xmath5 branes wrapped around a four - cycle in the calabi - yau variety .",
    "this leads to an @xmath6 supergravity background .",
    "now de sitter space can be achieved by incorporating an anti @xmath7 brane whose energy density makes the total energy density positive , this is the kklt stabilization mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it was then realized that the lifting of the vacuum energy can be performed in a supersymmetric way using fayet ",
    "iliopoulos terms  @xcite . in supergravity",
    ", it has been recently argued that this mechanism is problematic as the fayet ",
    "iliopoulos terms of supergravity vanish in a supergravity vacuum  @xcite .",
    "a first attempt to combine inflation with the kklt mechanism was carried out in the kklmmt paper , see ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model ,",
    "string inflation is obtained when a pair of @xmath7-anti @xmath7 branes is added to the configuration needed for the kklt mechanism and described above .",
    "the anti @xmath7 is naturally sitting on top of the other anti @xmath7 branes , the distance between the @xmath7 and anti @xmath7 branes playing the role of the inflaton .",
    "the shift symmetry is explicitly broken by the non - perturbative superpotential leading to the stabilization of the khler moduli .",
    "the flat directions corresponding the free motion of a @xmath7 brane in the calabi - yau space are then lifted in a strong manner . as a consequence ,",
    "since the shift symmetry is absent , the corresponding inflationary model suffers from the @xmath0 problem .",
    "more precisely , it has been shown that the squared mass of the inflaton is @xmath8 spoiling the flatness of the potential .",
    "this example is typical of the general flatness problem of supergravity potentials when no shift symmetry is present .",
    "subsequent papers have tried to overcome this problem by taking into account the shift symmetry while still relying on the kklt mechanism for stabilizing the moduli fields .",
    "the first model  @xcite to combine both aspects was based on an interesting type of configuration ( different from the one envisaged in the kklmmt paper ) corresponding to @xmath5 branes evolving in the background of a very heavy stack of @xmath7 branes  @xcite . in this case",
    ", one may consider the free motion of the @xmath5 brane and the associated shift symmetry .",
    "the model realizes hybrid inflation in string inflation .",
    "the waterfall fields are represented by the charged open strings between the @xmath7 and the @xmath5 branes . when the distance between the branes is large enough",
    ", the configuration admits a flat direction which is lifted at one loop as in supersymmetric hybrid inflation hence giving a logarithmic slope to the potential in the inflaton direction .",
    "the presence of a flat direction is directly linked to the fact that the superpotential takes the form required to both preserve the shift symmetry and stabilize the khler moduli . for small distances between the branes ,",
    "the waterfall fields condense and inflation ends .",
    "another possibility was studied in refs .",
    "it consists in implementing the shift symmetry in the context of the original kklmmt scenario , where inflation is obtained when a pair of @xmath7-anti @xmath7 branes is present .",
    "in fact , the shift symmetry is present initially in the khler potential . imposing the shift symmetry invariance of",
    "the superpotential leads to a flat potential for the inflation .",
    "inflation is then due to the small interaction potential between the @xmath7 and the anti @xmath7 brane . as in usual brane inflation",
    "this requires an adjustment of the brane  antibrane potential . in this context",
    ", it has been noticed that threshold corrections in string theory give rise to an explicitly shift symmetry breaking superpotential . as a consequence ,",
    "the model suffers from the @xmath9-problem unless the stabilization of the complex structure moduli is fine - tuned .",
    "we will discuss this model ( and compare it to what is achieved in the present article ) where the non - perturbative superpotential responsible for the stabilization of the khler moduli is multiplicatively corrected by loop effects  @xcite .",
    "finally the shift symmetry is also instrumental in the race ",
    "track inflation model  @xcite .",
    "notice that combining the kklt approach to stabilization and the shift symmetry in string theory requires the existence of isometries on calabi  yau threefolds as originally argued in ref .",
    "@xcite for compactifications on @xmath10 . in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on supergravity issues only and use string motivations as a guideline only .    combining the flatness of the f ",
    "term inflation potential in supergravity using the shift symmetry and the stabilization of moduli ( in particular using the kklt mechanism ) is the aim of this paper .",
    "we will extract the main ingredients from the d3/d7 system in string theory and deal with its supergravity description exclusively .",
    "the two main new aspects of the model presented here are the following .",
    "firstly , we will consider a case where the shift symmetry is initially present in both the khler and the superpotential before being mildly broken by an explicit inflaton dependence of the superpotential . in our case ,",
    "the fact that the superpotential can depend on the inflaton field allows us to give a ( small ) slope to the potential already at the tree level without having to compute the quantum corrections .",
    "notice that the shift symmetry breaking superpotential has coefficients constrained by the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) normalization and must therefore be small .",
    "we also insist on obtaining the inflationary potential from a strict @xmath11 supergravity context .",
    "secondly , we find that the end of inflation is due to the presence of the moduli field playing the role of a waterfall field .",
    "contrary to the hybrid inflation case , the end of inflation is not triggered by extra fields representing the charged open strings between the branes .",
    "in fact , the name waterfall field is not very appropriate in our case since we will see that the effective inflationary model is reminiscent of mutated inflation and that inflation stops due to the violation of the slow - roll conditions and not by instability .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section  ii , we present the flatness problem in f  term supergravity inflation and discuss the realization of the shift symmetry as a khler transformation .",
    "the shift symmetry alleviates the flatness problem and leads to restrictions on the type of possible superpotentials . in section  iii ,",
    "we give examples of chaotic inflation models with a shift symmetry broken by the superpotential .",
    "the model has problems such as runaway potentials . in section",
    "iv , we then introduce what we call `` mutated chaotic inflation '' based on a chaotic inflation superpotential and for which the inflationary trajectories become curved .",
    "this model does not suffer from the @xmath9-problem and the moduli is stabilized .",
    "we give a thorough analysis of the inflationary parameter space .",
    "in particular , we find that the model is different from hybrid inflation . in section",
    "v , we combine the kklt stabilization mechanism and a chaotic inflation superpotential .",
    "this gives another realization of mutated chaotic inflation .",
    "then , we discuss various aspects of our results .",
    "finally , in section  vi we present our conclusions .",
    "one of the stumbling blocks of f - term inflation in supergravity is the natural presence of @xmath12 corrections to the inflaton mass which would spoil the flatness of the potential ( the so  called @xmath0-problem ) .",
    "let us consider the khler potential for the inflaton of the form @xmath13 and its role in the scalar potential of supergravity @xmath14v_{\\rm inf}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the inflationary potential when neglecting the supergravity corrections and where @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 .",
    "expanding the exponential leads to @xmath18v_{\\rm inf}\\ , .\\ ] ] the first term leads to the inflation potential , while the second one leads to a term in @xmath19 which spoils the flatness of the potential , _",
    "i.e.  _ the quantity @xmath20 becomes of order one .",
    "however , one should also remark the following .",
    "the above parameter ( the so - called @xmath0-parameter ) is not the parameter which controls whether inflation is taking place or not . indeed , strictly speaking , the condition @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker scale factor , is equivalent to @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "when the @xmath25-parameter becomes of order one , we just have violation of the slow - roll conditions although , in principle , inflation could still proceed .",
    "of course , one could argue , based on the well - known formula , @xmath26 , that a parameter @xmath9 of order one would imply a scalar spectral index far from scale invariance , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath27 . again , this conclusion is not rigorous because the previous formula is derived under the assumption that the slow - roll conditions are valid and , hence , not applicable when @xmath9 is large . in principle",
    ", one could imagine a situation where @xmath9 is large but where inflation proceeds and leads to an almost scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "admittedly , this is probably not the most generic situation but this is possible in principle ; for interesting recent remarks on the @xmath9 problem , see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us now consider a typical ansatz , motivated by string inspired theories  @xcite given by @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + s{\\cal g}\\left(\\phi , \\phi ^{\\dagger}\\right)\\ , , \\\\ w & = & w\\left(\\rho , \\phi \\right)\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 according to the situation we want to describe . in the above expression ,",

    "similarly when @xmath37 , @xmath38 is also identified with the khler potential of the calabi - yau manifold and @xmath39 corresponds to the position of a @xmath5 brane .",
    "these two cases will be exemplified later .",
    "let us come back to the issue of the shift symmetry @xmath40 where @xmath4 is real which guarantees that the real part of the inflaton superfield is a flat direction .",

    "the previous model does not immediately lead to inflation in the @xmath39 direction as the scalar potential is exactly flat along the real @xmath56 direction due to the shift symmetry ( but the potential could be lifted by quantum corrections ) .",

    "there are two equivalent ways of lifting the potential energy for the moduli .",

    "<S> the presence of this symmetry guarantees the existence of a flat direction for the inflaton field . mildly breaking the shift symmetry using a superpotential which depends not only on the moduli but also on the inflaton field allows one to lift the inflaton flat direction . along the inflaton direction , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-problem is alleviated . combining the kklt mechanism for moduli stabilization and a shift symmetry breaking superpotential of the chaotic inflation type , we find models reminiscent of `` mutated hybrid inflation '' where the inflationary trajectory is curved in the moduli  inflaton plane . </S>",
