    "one of the most important questions in the standard model ( sm ) for elementary particle physics is why neutrinos have non - zero but quite small masses as compared to those of other fermions .",
    "this question can be interpreted to ask why the coefficient of the dimension five weinberg operator  @xcite @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 being dimensionless and dimensionful parameters , respectively ) is quite small , which gives majorana neutrino masses after replacing the higgs field @xmath3 by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . from the various measurements of neutrino oscillations ,",
    "typically @xmath4 must be the order of @xmath5 gev@xmath6 .",
    "the seesaw mechanism  @xcite gives us the simple explanation why we have such a small coefficient , namely , a right - handed neutrino is quite heavy , e.g. , @xmath7 gev with a @xmath8 yukawa coupling .",
    "however , to test this mechanism , we need a super high energy collider , and it seems to be unrealistic .    as an alternative scenario , there are radiative neutrino mass models originated from the zee model  @xcite . in these models , the smallness of the coupling @xmath1 can be naturally explained by a loop suppression factor @xmath9 in a @xmath10-loop model . as a result , we do not need to introduce super heavy particles such as the above mentioned right - handed neutrino , and thus we can test these models at collider experiments .",
    "in addition , in radiative neutrino mass models , some of new particles which appear in a loop diagram for the neutrino mass generation can be a dark matter ( dm ) candidate as in the model by ma  @xcite .",
    "empirically , three loop models can provide appropriate size of the coefficient @xmath1 with tev scale new particles and order of 0.1 - 1 couplings .",
    "the model by krauss , nasri and trodden  @xcite is the first proposed three loop model with dm .",
    "in addition to those models , it has been proposed other three loop models in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we build a new type of a three loop neutrino mass model with dm candidates . to have three loop diagrams , we introduce hypercharge @xmath11 isospin doublet scalar and lepton fields which include doubly and singly charged components . as a bonus , the anomaly in the muon @xmath12",
    "can also be simultaneously explained by loop effects of the @xmath11 particles .",
    "characteristic signatures at collider experiments are expected from the decay of the doubly charged scalar bosons , where they can mainly decay into the same - sign dilepton with the both right - handed and left- and right - handed chirality .",
    "this signature can be used to distinguish the other models with doubly charged scalar bosons .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we discuss a three loop neutrino mass model in the electroweak @xmath13 gauge theory with an additional unbroken discrete @xmath14 symmetry .",

    "the scalar sector is composed of isospin doublet fields with @xmath11 @xmath19 and with @xmath20 @xmath21 , and two singlets @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 . for simplicity , we take @xmath24 to be a real field .",
    "the @xmath14 symmetry plays three important roles in our model .",
    "first , it forbids the @xmath26 term ( @xmath27 being the 2 by 2 anti - symmetric matrix ) which provides the tree level dirac neutrino mass term .",
    "second , it also forbids the @xmath28 term which gives the tree level mixing between the exotic charged leptons and the sm charged - leptons .",
    "finally , the @xmath14 symmetry guarantees the stability of the lightest neutral @xmath14 odd particle , i.e. , @xmath29 or @xmath24 , so that it can be a candidate of dm .    in this setup ,",
    "the lepton sector lagrangian is given by @xmath30 where the first and second terms in the first line correspond to the majorana masses for @xmath17 and the dirac masses for @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "in the second line , @xmath31 represents the usual yukawa matrix which provides the masses of the sm charged - leptons .",
    "all the other terms give new yukawa interactions which are necessary to obtain left - handed majorana neutrino masses excepted for the @xmath32 term .",

    "next , we give a brief comment on the bosonic dm ( @xmath24 ) case .",
    "this corresponds to the so - called higgs portal dm scenario , where dm is annihilated via the @xmath62-channel higgs boson @xmath41 mediation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been found that the dm mass of about 500 gev can satisfies the relic density without conflicting the constraint from the direct searches such as the lux experiment  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this solution , when the dm mass is around the half of the higgs boson @xmath41 mass , i.e. , @xmath63 gev , both the relic density cross section and the direct search experiments can be satisfied using the @xmath41 pole effect .",
    "in our model setup shown in table  [ tab:1 ] , the tree level contribution to the left - handed neutrino masses , i.e. , via the type - i seesaw mechanism is forbidden by the @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "in addition , there are no one- and two - loop diagrams , where a systematic classification for one- and two - loop diagrams for majorana neutrino masses has been done in refs .",
    "@xcite . as a result",
    ", the leading order contribution to the neutrino masses is given at the three loop level as depicted in fig .",

    "the mass of @xmath45 , the most important bound comes from the same - sign dilepton searches at the lhc .",

    "@xcite , it has been clarified that the same - sign dilepton signals with a different chirality can be distinguished by using distributions of decay products of tau leptons .    finally , we comment on the signal and background events in our model .",

    "however , the same signal and background analysis given in  @xcite can be applied in our case , so that we expect to obtain the 5@xmath112 discovery reach for @xmath45 by requiring the roughly 2 times larger integrated luminosity than the case in the htm with the same mass of the doubly charged higgs bosons ( due to about the 50% reduction of the cross section as compared to the htm ) at the 14 tev lhc .",

    "<S> we propose a new type of a three - loop induced neutrino mass model with dark matter candidates which are required for the neutrino mass generation . </S>",
    "<S> the smallness of neutrino masses can be naturally explained without introducing super heavy particles , namely , much heavier than a tev scale and quite small couplings as compared to the gauge couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as a bonus , the anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment can simultaneously be explained by loop effects of new particles . in our model </S>",
    "<S> , there are doubly charged scalar bosons and leptons from isospin doublet fields which give characteristic collider signatures . in particular , the doubly charged scalar bosons can decay into the same - sign dilepton with its chirality of both right - handed or left- and right - handed . </S>",
    "<S> this can be a smoking gun signature to identify our model and be useful to distinguish other models with doubly charged scalar bosons at collider experiments . </S>"
