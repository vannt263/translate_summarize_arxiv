    "the dynamics of cold atomic vapours trapped in a periodic external potential , as created by means of a far - detuned standing wave of light , has become an active area of research .",
    "studies of ultracold atoms in such a confinement have revealed a number of behaviours which are well known in solid state physics : wannier - stark ladders [ 1 , 2 ] , bloch oscillations [ 3 , 4 ] and landau - zener tunneling [ 5 ] .",
    "more recently , the observation of interference between macroscopic quantum states of bose - einstein - condensed vapours of @xmath1rb atoms confined in a vertical array of optical traps has been reported [ 6 ] .",
    "interference between the condensates in different lattice wells manifests itself in falling drops , which are emitted with a period determined by the bloch oscillations induced by the gravitational field and are interpreted as coherent matter - wave pulses .",
    "the properties of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a regular array of optical wells have been studied theoretically and numerically by a number of authors [ 7 - 13 ] . especially relevant for our present purposes is the work on an interacting bec in an infinitely extended lattice potential by berg - srensen and mlmer [ 7 ] , who demonstrated band structure and bloch oscillations by solving numerically the bogolubov - de gennes equations for the excitations and the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation for motion under a constant applied force .",
    "they also gave analytic results for the excitation spectrum in the limit where the periodic potential can be treated as a perturbation .    from solid state theory",
    "a tight - binding ( tb ) approach offers the possibility of an analytic study of the same phenomena in the opposite limit , when the lattice potential is so strong compared with all other energy scales as to allow the use of on - site orbitals for the approximate construction of the bloch states .",
    "in fact , the proper theoretical tools are the so - called wannier functions , which are defined through the fourier transform of the bloch eigenfunctions in the momentum representation . in the particular case of one - dimensional ( 1d ) motion ,",
    "the energy bands are non - degenerate and the states in any given one of them are described from a single wannier function , by repeating it at each lattice site with the appropriate phase relationship between different sites .",
    "the tb scheme may then be realized by replacing the wannier function by an on - site `` atomic '' orbital , under suitable limiting conditions which may be valid for the low - lying energy bands .    while the wannier functions for motion in a generic periodic potential are usually not easy to calculate , it turns out that for the specific problem of 1d periodicity posed by the confinement of a bec in an array of optical wells one can take advantage of the results contained in a classic paper by slater [ 14 ] on a soluble problem in energy bands for electrons .",
    "slater s work also discusses the conditions under which the wannier functions for the low - lying energy bands can be accurately approximated by on - site orbitals , which in this case are the harmonic - oscillator wave functions associated with the parabola describing the bottom of each well .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we first model a dilute bec confined in a periodic optical potential as a 1d dynamical system via inclusion of the transverse size into a renormalized contact interaction .",
    "we then formulate the problem of 1d band structure in terms of wannier functions , the only conceptual difference from the analogous problem of 1d motion of electrons in a periodic potential being that for condensed bosons there is no gap between the condensate ground state and the excitation spectrum . in the same section",
    "we also formulate the problem of bloch oscillations of the condensate in a single band in terms of the fourier transform of the corresponding wannier function .",
    "the reduction of the general formalism to the tb approximation is effected in section 3 , after recalling slater s conditions for its validity and extending them to an interacting bec .",
    "the tb scheme displays in an explicit manner how the energy levels of a bec in a single well are shifted and spread into bands by the periodic replica of the well potential .",
    "we give special attention to ( i ) the lowest - lying energy band of the bec , which contains its wave - like phase excitations , and ( ii ) the connection that the tb approximation exhibits between the excitations in the next two higher bands and the dipole ( `` sloshing '' ) and quadrupole excitations in an effectively 1d harmonic well .",
    "the discussion suggests how excitations in these two bands may be observed .",
    "we conclude this section by simple numerical illustrations of the dispersion relation in the lowest band and of the current induced by a constant external force , for values of the system parameters which are relevant to the experiments of anderson and kasevich [ 6 ] .",
    "finally , section 4 ends the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a dilute vapour of atoms of mass @xmath2 in a bose - condensed state at zero temperature , which interact via elastic collisions described by an s - wave scattering length @xmath3 and are confined in the optical lattice created by a laser field .",
    "the lattice can be modelled as a transverse gaussian potential times a periodic potential along the @xmath4 direction , namely the confining potential is @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the well depth , scaling linearly with the intensity of the laser beam , @xmath7 is the transverse size of the beam and @xmath8 its wavenumber .",
    "the lattice period is @xmath9 .    in this work",
    "we reduce the above problem in cylindrical symmetry to an effective 1d problem . to this end",
    "we freeze the transverse motions of the bec and renormalize the interactions by a method proposed by jackson _ et al . _",
    "[ 15 ] to treat an elongated bec , in which the coherence length as introduced by baym and pethick [ 16 ] is much larger than the transverse size .",
    "this reduction will be inapplicable , however , to high - energy excitations , when the excitation energy becomes comparable with the transverse confinement energy and transverse motions can therefore be induced .    under the conditions indicated just above , the transverse confinement modifies the mean - field interactions by a factor depending on the axial density @xmath10 , the factor being @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the transverse part of the wave function in the @xmath13 plane . using a harmonic approximation for the radial part of the optical potential , we obtain in the present problem an effective scattering length per unit area given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of atoms per lattice well and @xmath16 .",

    "we explicitly point out that with this form of @xmath38 the interactions enter the determination of the excited - state wave functions only through the density distribution of the condensate ground state .",
    "the same assumption has been made in dealing with the excitations of condensates in harmonic traps [ 18 ] and has led to good agreement with experiment for the eigenfrequencies of the quadrupolar surface modes .    for a bec in a 1d periodic potential the quantum numbers @xmath32 are the band index @xmath39 and the lattice quasi - momentum @xmath40 . from symmetry under time reversal",

    "as for the homogeneous bose fluid we expect gaplessness , since in its ground state the whole condensate is in a single energy level placed at the chemical potential . therefore , the excitations of lowest energy ( referred to the chemical potential ) are phonons , i.e. they have a linear dispersion relation .",

    "the ground state of the condensate can be taken at @xmath54 in the lowest band ( @xmath55 , say ) and special care is needed in handling the functions @xmath56 , in order to ensure gaplessness .",
    "this point is discussed for a periodic condensate in appendix a , following the arguments given in refs . [ 19 ] and [ 20 ] .",
    "here we only need to note that an evaluation of the functions @xmath52 is not necessary for the determination of the excitation energy eigenvalues .",
    "these are calculated by solving eq .",

    "we thus write @xmath59 where the index @xmath60 runs over all @xmath61 sites of the lattice .",

    "orthogonality between different wells implies oscillatory tails , falling off more rapidly as overlap decreases .",
    "( [ wannier ] ) expresses a fourier - transform relationship between bloch orbitals and wannier functions , embodying the bloch translational symmetry .",
    "the @xmath40-dependent bloch orbitals emphasize the extended nature of the lattice states and the periodicity of their energy eigenvalues in momentum space .",
    "the representation in terms of wannier functions emphasizes instead that the lattice is a periodic assembly of identical wells .",

    "( [ wannier ] ) is ensured by the fact that the fourier coefficients do not involve a separate dependence on position @xmath4 and on lattice site index @xmath60 .    in the case of a bec in a lattice ,",
    "a general consequence of the wannier - function description is immediately evident from eq .",
    "( [ wannier ] ) .",
    "since the ground state is at the chemical potential and has been taken to lie at @xmath54 in the bottom of the lowest band , the excitations in this band are wave - like modulations of the condensate phase and their energy vanishes linearly in the limit @xmath64 .",
    "this fact can be traced back to the existence of a goldstone phonon - a collective mode without restoring force [ 19 ] resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking ( see the discussion in appendix a ) .    similarly , for the higher excitation bands",
    "( [ wannier ] ) shows that each of them is a superposition of localized excitations ( described by @xmath65 ) , which is constructed by imposing definite phase relationships between the various sites as dictated by the translational lattice symmetry .",
    "this theorem is valid , of course , within the bogolubov approach and has been derived through the reduction to one - dimensionality .    in practice ,",
    "the calculation of wannier functions is in general not an easy task . in the limit",
    "in which the wannier functions become almost confined inside each lattice well ( which may be true for low  lying states ) , they can be expanded in a limited number of `` atomic '' orbitals .",
    "we shall discuss in the next section the conditions under which one may replace the wannier functions for a bec in a periodic optical potential by single - well orbitals and thereby obtain explicit solutions in the tb limit .",
    "we proceed to express through the wannier functions the current carried by a periodic bose - condensed system subject to a constant force @xmath66 in the semiclassical regime .",

    "the aim of the tb approximation is to relate the properties of the periodic system in a lattice potential to the solution of the single ( isolated ) well problem .",
    "the results of the method are quantitative as long as the single - well solutions at adjacent sites do not overlap much with each other .",
    "namely , the validity of the tb approximation is limited by the condition that the band - width be smaller than the height of the lattice potential .",
    "slater [ 14 ] has studied the wannier functions of the `` mathieu problem '' defined by the schrdinger equation for non - interacting electrons moving in the periodic potential @xmath26 of present interest .",

    "slater s argument is summarized in appendix b and extended there to an interacting bec .",
    "in essence the mean - field interactions may be viewed in the present context as effecting a renormalization in the height of the external potential , thereby shifting slater s thresholds by the amount @xmath81 if the threshold conditions are satisfied , the wannier functions @xmath65 at positive energy could be approximately replaced by the eigenfunctions of the harmonic approximation to the single - well potential @xmath82 with @xmath83 $ ] and @xmath84 .      more generally , the evaluation of the energy bands for a periodic condensate in the tb approximation would require a preliminary solution of the on - site problem . to this end , we separate the on - site parts @xmath85 out of the operators @xmath86 entering eq .",

    "( [ bandgen ] ) displays the two main changes induced by lattice periodicity on the single - well energy levels , namely ( i ) a shift of each level relative to the single - well value @xmath89 and ( ii ) the broadening of the level into a band .",
    "in particular , for the lowest band the shift corresponds to a renormalization of the chemical potential from the single - well value @xmath91 to the value @xmath25 , which has to be evaluated self - consistently from the condition @xmath97 .",

    "we make use of the present replacement of wannier functions by on - site orbitals , which are approximately described by the eigenfunctions of the 1d harmonic oscillator .",
    "evidently , this allows us to identify the on - site excitation leading to the @xmath98 band with the dipolar sloshing mode of the condensed particles within the well .",
    "the construction of bloch orbitals from these localized sloshing motions simply amounts to fixing , for each value of the wavenumber @xmath40 , their relative phases according to the lattice translational symmetry ( see the discussion already given near the end of section 2.2 ) . similarly , the excitations in the @xmath99 band may be viewed as resulting from localized , single - well quadrupolar modes with relative phases depending on @xmath40 as imposed by lattice symmetry .",
    "of course , the approximate validity of such a visualization of the collective low - lying modes of a periodic bec is subject not only to conditions relating to effective one - dimensionality in a mean - field approach , but also to the restrictions associated with the tb scheme .",
    "the above discussion also suggests how these collective band modes may become accesible to experimental or computational observation",

    "excitation of dipolar and quadrupolar band modes at finite @xmath40 would require similar probes at given wavelengths .",

    "in summary , and as already discussed in the work of berg - srensen and mlmer [ 7 ] , the properties which derive from lattice symmetry for the wave functions and the energy eigenvalues of electrons moving in a periodic 1d potential also hold for a bose - condensed system . however , bose statistics and spontaneous symmetry breaking imply that there is no gap between the condensate ground state and the excitation spectrum .",
    "this latter property can be met in the energy spectra of electrons in semiconductors only as a consequence of accidental degeneracies induced by specific space symmetries , a well known instance being provided by graphite [ 22 ] . for a periodic bose condensate the gaplessness property , together with the quadratic structure of the energies as expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ bogoeqe2 ] ) ( see section 2.1 ) , yields on general grounds the linear dispersion relation @xmath122 for the lowest energy band .",
    "we have seen that the specific form of the optical potential acting on a bec from a laser field admits two important simplifications in the band - structure problem .",
    "firstly , the problem for the low - lying bands can be mapped into a one - dimensional one by accounting for the transverse cross - section of the bec through a renormalization of the s - wave scattering length .",
    "this mapping has been shown to be useful in relation to the experiments performed by anderson and kasevich [ 12 ] .",
    "secondly , the 1d problem away from the weak - confinement limit is most naturally formulated in terms of the wannier functions , which have already been studied for the mathieu problem by slater [ 14 ] .",
    "the use of wannier functions , as demonstrated in section 2.2 , provides an exact formulation of the lattice problem and immediately shows that ( i ) the lowest excitations of a condensate in a periodic potential are wave - like phase modulations , and ( ii ) the higher bands arise from the superposition of localized excitations with definite phase relationships .",
    "an analytic study of semiclassical transport in a periodic condensate subject to a constant external force becomes straightforward with the use of wannier functions .",
    "the expectation value of the momentum operator is periodic with the bloch period and vanishes at the brillouin zone edges , as shown in section 2.3 .",
    "the work of slater [ 14 ] allows one to specify the conditions under which the wannier functions for the low - lying bands of the bec in an optical periodic potential , and in particular that for the lowest band containing its phase excitations , can be accurately approximated by harmonic - oscillator wave functions .",
    "these functions are simply described by the curvature of the on - site well as renormalized by the interactions in the bec and allow an explicit , though approximate , connection to be made between band modes and single - well modes .",
    "they also allow very simple calculations on a periodic bec , as illustrated in section 3 for the dispersion relation in the lowest energy band and for the average wavenumber - dependent momentum in correspondence to a particular set of system parameters which is relevant to experiment .    *",

    "this yields the energy function @xmath171 which is minimized when @xmath102 obeys the condition @xmath172 evidently , repulsive interactions broaden the wannier function .",
    "a similar estimate of @xmath102 for the @xmath98 band states shows that the role of the interactions is decreasing with increasing energy .",
