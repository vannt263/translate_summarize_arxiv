    "a considerable interest in actual research of superconductivity ( sc ) with high critical temperature is focused on the family of doped ferropnictide compounds @xcite and one of their notable distinctions from `` old '' bcs superconductors and more recent doped perovskite systems consists in possibility for a peculiar , so - called extended s - wave symmetry of superconducting order parameter which changes its sign between electron and hole segments of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "this additional property permits to avoid the fundamental limitation by the anderson s theorem @xcite for non - magnetic impurities to produce localized impurity levels within the superconducting band gap @xcite . at finite , but low enough , impurity concentration ,",
    "such levels are expected to give rise to some resonance effects like those well studied in semiconductors at low doping concentrations @xcite .",
    "analogous effects in superconductors were theoretically predicted and experimentally discovered for magnetic impurities , either in bcs systems @xcite and in the two - band mgb@xmath0 system @xcite . in all those cases ,",
    "the breakdown of the anderson s theorem is only due to the breakdown of the spin - singlet symmetry of an @xmath1-wave cooper pair by a spin - polarized impurity , and the main physical interest of the considered case of sc iron pnictides from the point of view of disorder in general is the possibility for pair - breaking even on non - magnetic impurity scatterers .",
    "the latter theoretical prediction was confirmed by the observations of various effects from localized impurity states , for instance , in the superfluid density ( observed through the london penetration length ) @xcite , transition critical temperature @xcite and electronic specific heat @xcite , all mainly due to an emerging spike of electronic density of states against its zero value in the initial band gap .",
    "but it is also known that indirect interactions between random impurity centers of certain type ( the so - called deep levels at high enough concentrations ) in doped semiconductors can lead to formation of collective band - like states @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the anderson transition in a general disordered system @xcite , and the emerging new band of quasiparticles in the spectrum can essentially change thermodynamics and transport in the doped material @xcite .",
    "an intriguing possibility for similar banding of impurity levels within the sc gap @xcite was recently discussed for the doped ferropnictides @xcite .",
    "the present work is aimed on a more detailed analysis of the band - like impurity states , focused on their observable effects that can not be produced by localized impurity states .",
    "we use the specific form of green functions for superconducting quasiparticles derived in the previous work @xcite in the general kubo - greenwood formalism @xcite to obtain the temperature and frequency dependences of optical and thermal conductivity and also of thermoelectric coefficients .",
    "these results are compared with the available experimental data and some suggestions are done on possible practical applications of such impurity effects .",

    "<S> effects of impurities and disorder on transport properties by electronic quasiparticles in superconducting iron pnictides are theoretically considered . </S>",
    "<S> the most prominent new features compared to the case of pure material should appear at high enough impurity concentration when a specific narrow band of conducting quasiparticle states can develop within the superconducting gap , around the position of localized impurity level by a single impurity center . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted specific threshold effects in the frequency dependent optical conductivity and temperature dependent thermal conductivity and also in seebeck and peltier coefficients can have interesting potentialities for practical applications . </S>"
