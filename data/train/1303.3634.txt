    "accurate photometry is one of the key tools of astronomy , yet ground - base astronomy continues to suffer the traditional challenge of accurate photometric calibration . careful analysis of standard ground - based ccd imaging data can yield relative photometry of objects in a small field with accuracy of 1% or better , and exotic techniques can produce much higher accuracy in special cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the remaining challenge for the generic astronomer is that of calibration of the photometry of a given field into one of the standard systems .",
    "part of the difficulty comes from the various effective bandpasses due to the different telescopes and cameras used by observers .",
    "critical attention must be paid to the bandpass defined by the choice of filter , detector , etc ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "however , for main sequence stars of spectral types earlier than @xmath6 k0 , these bandpass effects can be dealt with through measured color transformations .",
    "the larger challenge comes from the calibration of the images with respect to a well - defined reference .",
    "calibration of images obtained from the ground is naturally difficult due to the large area of the sky and the small sizes of detectors , even modern large mosaic cameras .",
    "calibration of most individual images still ultimately relies on observations of objects in reference fields outside of the field of view of interest .",
    "since there is currently no all - sky network of calibrated references with sufficiently dense spacing , the calibration observations invariably do not overlap the science fields .",
    "photometric calibration is thus sensitive to the systematic impact of changes in the atmosphere or the instrument between the observation of the science field and the reference field .",
    "ground - based optical astronomy is on the verge of escaping this traditional problem  several projects are now ( or will soon be ) able to define dense large - area networks of reference photometry with accuracies at or below the 1% level .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , for example , provides good photometry across the @xmath7 steradians covered by that survey ( up through dr9 ) , with reported systematic errors of @xmath8 millimagnitudes for the @xmath9 filters @xcite .",
    "lsst will eventually provide the same or better for the @xmath10 steradians of the portion of the sky covered by that survey .",
    "the  project is surveying the @xmath0 steradians north of @xmath11 deg declination @xcite .",
    "a major goal of this survey project is the construction of a precision photometry reference catalog covering the entire @xmath0 region .",
    "the design of the survey and the careful attention to calibration concerns place it in an excellent position to provide a photometric ( and astrometric ) reference for this entire @xmath0 region .",
    "the  survey is continuing , and final calibration will not be complete for @xmath6 6 months after the survey completion , roughly mid 2014 . at this point in time , however , interest in the community has grown strong in a preliminary data release to demonstrate the progress at precision photometric calibration , and to potentially provide reference data in the ps1 photometry system , and in regions not currently served by the sdss survey .",
    "@xmath0 survey coverage statistics[table : coverage ] [ cols= \" < , > , > , > ,",
    "< , > , > \" , ]      over the next 1.5 - 2 years , pan - starrs 1 will finish the initial basic survey , completing coverage of the full @xmath0 region .",
    "one of our major eventual goals is the production of a high - quality astrometric and photometric reference catalogs which can be used by observers to calibrate data with in - field references .",
    "the full survey dataset is necessary to pin down all regions at the highest possible precision .",
    "the vagaries of weather means that some substantial patches have not yet been observed in photometric conditions , and are only currently tied via relative photometry to the rest of the survey .    in this initial public release",
    ", we are providing the ps1 reference photometry ladder as a sample of future  photometric calibration data .",
    "the ladder consists of 4 strips in right ascension , 1 degree high , at declinations of ( -25 , 0 , + 25 , + 50 ) , and 24 strips in declination , 1 ra degree wide centered on ra hours ( see figure  [ fig : ladder ] ) .",
    "we have selected a subset of bright ( @xmath12 ) , well - measured ( @xmath13 observations total ) objects in these regions .",
    "the brightness limit was chosen to be equivalent to an instrumental magnitude of -9.5 , or roughly 2% statistical errors .",
    "this brightness cut not only restricts the sample to objects with high signal - to - noise , it also avoids the stars affected by inconsistencies for faint stars .",
    "the inconsistencies we have observed take the form of variations in the measured flux for faint stars , relative to bright stars in the same images , as a function of seeing .",
    "we have also limited the density to @xmath1 objects for each 1 square degree patch . to choose a high - quality sample at this limited density , we used the mean @xmath14 value for the , , and  mean magnitudes to select the high - quality measurements .",
    "we then selected the 1000 objects for a given patch in ascending order of @xmath14 so that objects with consistent photometry are preferred .",
    "we provide two sets of photometry tables : `` ubercal '' and `` relphot '' .",
    "the ubercal tables only include objects for which all 5 filters have measurements calibrated directly in the ubercal analysis .",
    "the relphot tables accept objects for which some filters have been tied to the ubercal data via relative photometry .",
    "as discussed above , the relphot values have lower confidence and should not be used for precision photometry .",
    "however , the relphot tables provide additional sky coverage . in most of these areas , a subset of the filters",
    "have ubercal photometry .",
    "careful use of the per - filter flags is advised !",
    "the tables are provided as fits and comma - separated value tables .",
    "table  [ table : example ] defines the columns available in the tables .",
    "there are 27 separate tables , 1 for each of the ladder rungs in dec and 1 for each of the rungs in ra .",
    "note that there are duplicate entries between files where the rungs overlap .",
    "table  [ table : example ] describes the fields provided for each object .",
    "data for each of the five filters ( ) are given in blocks , with 6 parameters provided for each filter .",
    "the magnitude provided is the mean psf magnitude calibrated as described above .",
    "the error is the formal error determined by accepting the reported error from the photometric analysis for each separate measurement .",
    "@xmath15 represents the number of measurements actually used to determine the mean magnitude .",
    "because of outlier clipping , this number may be smaller than the number of separate epochs available for a given object .",
    "the standard deviation of the mean magnitude is reported _ after _ clipping has been applied . the mean magnitude calculated for each filter",
    "is coupled to a set of bit - flags which describe the averaging process ( table  [ table : flags ] ) .",
    "this value is reported as a 32-bit integer , but only the following 8 bits are used for each filter ( see the discussion in section  [ sec.relphot ] ) .    to assess the extendedness of an object , we use the difference between the psf and aperture magnitudes . if this difference is larger than 0.1 added in quadrature to 2.5 times the statistical error , then the measurement is considered extended .",
    "this measurement shows the presence of additional light in the aperture beyond the core consistent with the psf model .",
    "the flag noting a possible extended object is raised if more than 50% of the measurements in a given band are observed to be extended based on this test .",
    "the  survey has been made possible through contributions of the institute for astronomy , the university of hawaii , the pan - starrs project office , the max - planck society and its participating institutes , the max planck institute for astronomy , heidelberg and the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics , garching , the johns hopkins university , durham university , the university of edinburgh , queen s university belfast , the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics , and the las cumbres observatory global telescope network , incorporated , the national central university of taiwan , and the national aeronautics and space administration under grant no .",

    "<S> photometry is provided for stars down to @xmath5 in the ab system . </S>",
