    "quantum entanglement plays an important role in the area of quantum information such as quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , telecloning @xcite and many more .",
    "it is one of the most fundamental concepts in the description of quantum correlations in multipartite quantum systems and makes possible tasks in quantum information which are impossible without it .",
    "therefore it was important to quantify the amount of quantum correlations in a given bipartite quantum state .",
    "much effort has been devoted to the classification of quantum states into separable and entangled states ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "until some time ago , entanglement was usually regarded as the only kind of nonclassical correlation in a composed state .",
    "however , there are other nonclassical correlations different from those involved in entanglement which are useful for quantum technology . hence , to characterize all nonclassical correlations present in a multipartite system , the so - called quantum discord , which goes beyond entanglement , was introduced in @xcite .",
    "now , it is commonly accepted that quantum discord constitutes a new resource for quantum computation . among the evidences of the relevance of the quantum discord , one may quote for instance quantum non - locality without entanglement @xcite and the advantages offered in increasing the rapidity of certain computational tasks with separable states in comparison with their classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "but , it may be noticed that despite increasing evidences for relevance of the quantum discord in information processing tasks , there is no straightforward method to get the analytical form of quantum discord in a given quantum state .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that its evaluation involves an optimization procedure which is in general a hard task to perform .",
    "a reliable algorithm to evaluate quantum discord for general two - qubit states is still missing and only few analytical results were obtained for some particular forms of the so - called two - qubit x - states @xcite .",
    "this class includes the maximally entangled bell states and werner states @xcite .",
    "a closed expression for the discord of arbitrary states remains an important challenge .",
    "on the other hand , quantum optical tools are expected to be useful in the context of quantum information science , especially for communications using qubits over long distance .",
    "however , optical qubits suffer from decoherence due to energy loss or photon absorption . to reduce the decoherence effects ,",
    "encoding qubits in multi - photon optical coherent states seems to be a promising alternative .",
    "they are more robust against small levels of photon absorption ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the photon loss or amplitude damping in a noisy environment can be modeled by assuming that some of field energy and information is lost after transmission through a beam splitter .    considering this problem and motivated by many works devoted to study entanglement properties in a composite system involving coherent states ( for a recent review see @xcite )",
    ", we investigate in this paper a method to describe the evolution of quantum discord in bell cat - states under amplitude damping .",
    "we present an algorithm to calculate the quantum discord .",
    "first , we obtain an explicit and simplified expression for the conditional entropy , exploiting the bloch representation of the density matrix . then , we combine the purification method and the koashi - winter relation @xcite to perform easily the optimization of the conditional entropy .",
    "this allows us to get a closed form of quantum discord in damped bell cat - states . exploiting our algorithm",
    ", we examine the dynamical evolution of the system under a dephasing channel to compare the temporal behaviors of quantum discord and entanglement as quantifiers of non - classical correlations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides an introduction to quantum discord .",
    "we present the main definitions and properties .",
    "section 3 concerns glauber coherent states superpositions subjected to an amplitude damping channel . in the optical context",
    ", amplitude damping can be appropriately modeled by having the signal interact with a vacuum mode in a beam splitter .",
    "having identified the effect of amplitude damping , we study in section 4 the evolution of the quantum correlations of bell cat - states under amplitude damping .",
    "we obtain the explicit form of quantum discord .",
    "section 5 deals with the comparison of the evolution of quantum discord and entanglement under a dephasing channel , using the results of the previous sections .",
    "finally , the last section recalls the main results of our work and suggests further issues deserving to be investigated .",
    "for a state @xmath4 of a bipartite quantum system composed of particle @xmath5 and particle @xmath6 , the quantum discord is defined as the difference between total correlation @xmath7 and classical correlation @xmath8 .",
    "the total correlation is usually quantified by the mutual information @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reduced state of @xmath5(@xmath6 ) , and @xmath12 is the von neumann entropy of a quantum state @xmath13 .",
    "suppose that a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) measurement is performed on particle @xmath5 .",
    "the set of povm elements is denoted by @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we remind that the generalized positive operator valued measurement is not required .",
    "indeed , it has be shown in @xcite that for the optimal measurement for the conditional entropy is ensured by projective one .",
    "thus , a projective measurement on the subsystem @xmath5 project the system into a statistical ensemble @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 where the von neumann measurement for subsystem @xmath5 writes as @xmath19 with @xmath20 is the projector for subsystem @xmath5 along the computational base @xmath21 , @xmath22 is a unitary operator with unit determinant , and @xmath23.\\ ] ] the amount of information acquired about particle @xmath6 is then given by @xmath24 which depends on measurement @xmath25 .",
    "this dependence can be removed by doing maximization over all the measurements , which gives rise to the definition of classical correlation : @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\      & = s(\\rho^b ) - \\widetilde{s}_{\\rm min }        \\label{def : classical correlation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 denotes the minimal value of the conditional entropy @xmath28 then , the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 gives the amount of quantum discord in the system @xmath29 the main difficulty , for several qubits as well as qudits systems , lies in performing the minimization of the conditional entropy .",
    "this explains why there is no straightforward algorithm to compute explicitly quantum discord for mixed states .",
    "only partial results are available .",
    "they were obtained for some special forms of the so - called x - states @xcite .",
    "the beam splitter offers a simple way to probe the quantum nature of electromagnetic field through simple experiments .",
    "the study of entangled states has revived interest in this device .",
    "many authors have considered the behavior of quantum states when passed through a beam splitter @xcite .",
    "recently , a quantum network of beam splitters was used to create multi - particle entangled states of continuous variables @xcite and also multi - particle entangled coherent states @xcite .",
    "it also provides , as mentioned in the introduction , a simple way to model the amplitude damping related to the absorption of transmitted photons in a noisy channel .      the beam splitter is an optical device with two input and two output ports that , in some sense , governs the interaction of two harmonic oscillators .",
    "the input and output boson operators are related by a unitary transformation which is an element of the @xmath30 group defined by    @xmath31.\\ ] ]    the objects @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 are the usual harmonic oscillator ladder operators .",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath35 are defined in terms of the angle @xmath36 .",
    "the operator @xmath37 is actually acting on the states @xmath38 of the usual two dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "if the input state is @xmath38 , then the @xmath39 action leads to the following fock states superposition @xmath40 and in general the output is a two - particle entangled state . on the other hand ,",
    "the action of the unitary operator @xmath37 on the state @xmath41 gives @xmath42 where the new variable @xmath43 is defined as the ratio of the reflection and transmission coefficients of the beam splitter under consideration .",
    "then , the output state ( [ suncs ] ) turns out to be the @xmath30 coherent state associated with the unitary representation labeled by the integer @xmath44 .",
    "this method can be extended to a chain of @xmath45 beam splitters to generate @xmath46 coherent states labeled by the reflection and transmission parameters ( see for instance @xcite where similar notations were used ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the generation of coherent states using beam splitters requires input radiation state with fixed number of photons .",
    "the experimental production of such interesting and highly non classical states has been investigated during the last decade ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently an important experimental advance was reported by hofheinz et al in @xcite .",
    "they gave the first experimental demonstration for generating photon number fock states containing up to @xmath47 photons in a super - conducting quantum circuit .",
    "to describe the photon loss , we usually assume that some of the coherent field is lost in transit via a beam splitter .",
    "the coherent states enters one port of the beam splitter and the vacuum , representing the environment , enters the second port . after transmission some information encoded in the coherent states is transferred and the remaining amount of information is lost to the noisy channel . to find the final state after transmission",
    ", we should first evaluate the action of the operator @xmath48 on the transmitted state . here",
    "we shall be interested in the superpositions of the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is a normalization factor given by @xmath52 so , we start by evaluating the beam splitter action on the bipartite state @xmath53 where the glauber coherent - state @xmath54 this yields @xmath55 it follows that the action of the operator @xmath48 on the state @xmath56 gives @xmath57 a state describing the quantum field and loss modes ( environment ) . the final state is then obtained by performing a partial trace over the loss mode @xmath58 .",
    "we get @xmath59 a straightforward calculation gives @xmath60 + \\frac { 1- c}{2}\\bigg [ \\bigg ( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n(\\alpha ) } } ( a|- \\alpha t\\rangle - b |\\alpha t\\rangle ) \\bigg ) \\bigg ] \\times { \\rm h.c.}\\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 stands for hermitian conjugation and @xmath62 is the the coherent states overlapping @xmath63 .",
    "the last equation can be also written as @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the pauli @xmath65-operator defined by @xmath66 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n(\\alpha t ) } } ( a |\\alpha t \\rangle   - b |\\alpha t \\rangle ) \\ ] ] which produces a phase flip in the qubit basis .",
    "this implies that the transmission of quantum information encoded in optical coherent states suffers from two main types of error : the reduction of the amplitude of the coherent state and the phase flip generated by the application of the pauli @xmath65-operator .",
    "the above considerations can be extended to two mode coherent states of the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 the action of a beam splitter on the state @xmath69 gives @xmath70 the trace over the lost modes gives the density @xmath71 here again , one can see that the density @xmath13 takes the following compact form @xmath72.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the final state is mixed and the amplitude of the second mode is reduced .",
    "the bell states are very interesting in quantum optics and have been used in the field of quantum teleportation and many others quantum computing operations .",
    "the experimental generation can be realized by sending a cat states of the form @xmath73 and the vacuum into the two input ports of a 50/50 beam splitter @xmath74 ( see equation ( [ action1 ] ) ) to get @xmath75 where the normalization factor is defined by @xmath76 obviously , the problem of generating bell states is deeply dependent on the availability of a source of cat states .",
    "for instance , they can be produced by sending a coherent state into a nonlinear medium exhibiting the kerr effect @xcite .",
    "they can be also generated using a squeezing interaction , linear optical devices and photon counters @xcite .",
    "recently , a promising new method to produce cat states was proposed by lund _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "the production of cat states especially ones of high amplitude or mean number of photons remains an experimental challenge . considering the fast technical progress and the increasing number of groups working in this field",
    ", we expect that the generation of cat states ( and bell states ) is a goal that is achievable in the near future .",
    "the available experimental results in the literature , obtained with the present day technology , are encouraging .",
    "superpositions of weak coherent states with opposite phase , resembling to a small `` schrdinger s cat '' state ( or `` schrdinger s kitten '' ) , were produced by photon subtraction from squeezed vacuum @xcite .",
    "also , the experimental generation of arbitrarily large squeezed cat states , using homodyne detection and photon number states ( two photons ) as resources was reported in @xcite .",
    "very recently , creation of coherent state superpositions , by subtracting up to three photons from a pulse of squeezed vacuum light , is reported in @xcite .",
    "the mean photon number of such coherent states produced by three - photon subtraction is of 2:75 .",
    "using the results of the previous section , it is simple to verify that under the action of a beam splitter on the state ( [ bell ] ) , the resultant density is @xmath77.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to study the quantum correlations in this state , a qubit mapping is required .",
    "it can be defined as follows .",
    "for the first mode @xmath5 , we introduce a two dimensional basis spanned by the vectors @xmath78 and @xmath79 defined by @xmath80 where @xmath81 to simplify our purpose , we take @xmath82 and @xmath83 reals : @xmath84 similarly , for the second mode @xmath6 , a two - dimensional basis generated by the vectors @xmath85 and @xmath86 is defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 the density matrix @xmath4 ( [ density - main ] ) can be cast in the following matrix form @xmath89 in the representation spanned by two - qubit product states @xmath90 the visual form of the obtained density ( [ xform ] ) resembles the letter @xmath91 and it is a special kind of the so - called called x - states which have been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the density @xmath4 also rewrites , in the bloch representation , as @xmath92 where the correlation matrix elements are given by @xmath93 @xmath94      the density @xmath4 is a two qubit state of rank two .",
    "the corresponding non vanishing eigenvalues are given by @xmath95 it follows that the joint entropy is @xmath96 the quantum mutual information is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the marginal states of @xmath4 , and @xmath100 with @xmath101 reporting ( [ sa+sb ] ) into ( [ iab ] ) , the quantum mutual information reads @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "after computing the quantum mutual information , we need next to compute the classical correlation @xmath8 defined by ( [ def : classical correlation ] ) .",
    "we consider projective measurements for subsystem @xmath5 .",
    "we follow the procedure developed in @xcite .",
    "we remind that the generalized positive operator valued measurement is not required . indeed ,",
    "as mentioned above , the optimal measurement for the conditional entropy is ensured by projective operator @xcite .",
    "the general form of the @xmath30 unitary operator , occurring in ( [ eq : vnmsur ] ) , is @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this parametrization allows us to express the quantities defined by @xmath107 as @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "they can be also written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "these mean values combined with the expressions of the correlation matrix elements ( [ r03+r30 ] ) and ( [ rii ] ) determine the explicit form of the conditional densities ( [ rhobk ] ) and the conditional entropy ( [ condit - entropy ] ) in terms of the angular variables @xmath36 and @xmath112 .",
    "indeed , combining the equations ( [ rhobk ] ) , ( [ eq : vnmsur ] ) , ( [ xform ] ) and ( [ operatoru ] ) , it is simply seen that the density operators @xmath113 take the following form @xmath114 where @xmath115 it follows that the conditional entropy given by ( [ condit - entropy ] ) rewrites also as @xmath116 and can explicitly expressed as a function of @xmath36 and @xmath112 .",
    "then , the minimization of @xmath117 can performed over the polar and azimuthal angles .",
    "nevertheless , there exists another elegant way to optimize the conditional entropy .",
    "it is based on the koashi - winter relation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as we shall explain in what follows .",
    "the koashi - winter relation establishes the connection between the classical correlation of a bipartite state @xmath4 and the entanglement of formation of its complement @xmath118 .",
    "this connection requires the purification of the state @xmath4 . in this respect ,",
    "as @xmath4 is a two - qubit state of rank two , it decomposes as @xmath119 where the eigenvalues @xmath120 and @xmath121 are given by ( [ lambda12 ] ) and the eigenstates @xmath122 and @xmath123 are @xmath124 attaching a qubit @xmath125 to the bipartite system @xmath126 , we write the purification of @xmath4 as @xmath127 such that the whole system @xmath128 is described by the pure density state @xmath129 from which one has the bipartite densities @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "suppose now that a von neumann measurement @xmath132 is performed on qubit @xmath5 ( here also we need positive operator valued measurement of rank one that is proportional the one dimensional projector ) .",
    "from the viewpoint of the whole system in the pure state @xmath133 , the measurement gives rise to an ensemble for @xmath118 that we denote by @xmath134 where @xmath135.\\ ] ] on the other hand , from the viewpoint of the state @xmath4 , the von neuman measurement on @xmath5 gives rise to the ensemble for @xmath99 defined previously as @xmath136 .",
    "it is simple to check that the ensemble @xmath137 can be induced from @xmath138 by tracing out the qubit @xmath125 , namely @xmath139.\\ ] ] we denote by @xmath140 the measure of entanglement for pure states .",
    "it is given by the von neumann entropy of the reduced subsystem @xmath141 @xmath142 it follows that the average of entanglement of formation over the ensemble @xmath143 @xmath144 coincides with the conditional entropy ( [ condit - entropy]).at this level , it is important to notice that koachi and winter @xcite have pointed out that the minimum value of @xmath145 is exactly the entanglement of formation of @xmath118 .",
    "consequently , @xmath146 this relation simplifies drastically the minimization process of the conditional entropy .",
    "therefore , employing the prescription presented in @xcite to get the concurrence of the density @xmath118 , one obtains @xmath147 with @xmath148 it is remarkable that the minimal value of the conditional entropy given by ( [ smin ] ) is reached for @xmath149 and @xmath150 . indeed , using the explicit form of the conditional entropy ( [ stilde ] ) in term of the polar and azimuthal angles @xmath36 and @xmath151 , one can verify that @xmath152 it is important to stress that the special values @xmath153 and @xmath154 coincide with ones obtained in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for optimal measurements to access quantum discord of two - qubit states . according to the equation ( [ def : classical correlation ] ) ,",
    "the classical correlation is @xmath155 and using the definition ( [ def : discord ] ) , the explicit expression of quantum discord reads @xmath156 note that for @xmath157 , the density state @xmath4 ( [ density - main ] ) reduces to the pure density bell cat - states ( [ bell ] ) and the the quantum discord ( [ qd - formula ] ) gives @xmath158 which is , as expected , exactly the entanglement of formation @xmath159 .",
    "indeed , it is simple to check that the concurrence of the pure bell cat - state @xmath160 is @xmath161 which coincides for @xmath157 with the concurrence of the state ( [ density - main ] ) given by @xmath162 where we used the definition of the concurrence for mixed states introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is also simply verified from ( [ qd - formula ] ) that for @xmath163 , the quantum discord vanishes and the concurrence ( [ crhoab ] ) is also zero .    the behavior of quantum discord ( [ qd - formula ] ) versus the overlapping @xmath164 and the reflection coefficient @xmath165 is plotted in the figure 1 .",
    "as seen from this figure , for @xmath164 fixed the quantum discord decreases as we increase the reflection parameter @xmath165 of the beam splitter and the maximum is obtained in the limiting case @xmath166 .",
    "this indicates that the noisy channel , inducing the decoherence effects , renders the system less correlated and subsequently the quantum discord decreases . in other hand , for a fixed value of @xmath165 , the quantum discord starts increasing , reaches a maximal value and decreases after . to see this behavior , we plot in the figure 2 , the quantum discord versus the overlapping for bell cat - states for different values of the reflection coefficient @xmath165 . in particular , under the action of a 50:50 beam splitter ,",
    "the maximal value of quantum discord is reached for @xmath167 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath157 , the maximum of the quantum discord or entanglement of formation is attained for @xmath168 . from the figure 2 , it is easily seen that the value of the overlap @xmath164 , for which the quantum discord @xmath169 is maximal , increases for increasing values of @xmath165 .",
    "1 : the pairwise quantum discord @xmath169 versus the overlapping @xmath164 of glauber states and the reflection parameter @xmath170 .",
    "2 : the pairwise quantum discord @xmath169 versus the overlapping @xmath164 for different values of @xmath165",
    "in this section , we investigate the dynamics of bipartite quantum correlations ( entanglement and quantum discord ) of damped bell cat - states , given by the density @xmath4 ( [ xform ] ) , under dephasing channel .",
    "to describe conveniently the effect of this channel , we use the the kraus operator approach ( see for instance @xcite ) . in this approach",
    ", the time evolution of the bipartite density @xmath171 ( [ xform ] ) can be written compactly as @xmath172 where the so - called kraus operators @xmath173 the operators @xmath174 describe the one - qubit quantum channel effects . for a dephasing channel , the non - zero kraus operators are given by @xmath175 with @xmath176 and @xmath177 denoting the decay rate .",
    "this gives @xmath178 the entanglement in this state is measured by the concurrence @xmath179 where @xmath180   \\qquad   \\lambda_2(t ) = \\frac{2}{n_{\\alpha}}a_{\\alpha } a_{\\alpha t}b_{\\alpha } b_{\\alpha t}\\bigg [ ( 1 - \\gamma ) ( 1 - c ) - ( 1+c)\\bigg].\\ ] ] since @xmath181 is non positive , the concurrence is @xmath182\\label{c(t)}\\ ] ] for @xmath183.\\ ] ] in this case , the system is entangled .",
    "however , for @xmath184 , the concurrence is zero and the entanglement disappears . , i.e. the system is separable .",
    "this shows clearly that under dephasing channel , the entanglement suddenly vanishes .",
    "note that the bipartite system under consideration is entangled in the absence of external noise . indeed , for @xmath185 , the concurrence ( [ c(t ) ] ) reproduces ( [ crhoab ] ) which is non zero except in the limiting case @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) or @xmath188 .",
    "the phenomenon of total loss of entanglement , termed in the literature `` entanglement sudden death '' @xcite , was experimentally confirmed under some specific conditions @xcite . as the concurrence vanishes after a finite time @xmath189",
    ", it is interesting to ask what happens to quantum discord .",
    "the explicit expression of the amount quantum discord in the state @xmath190 can be obtained following the method described in the previous section .",
    "but , here we need only to know if the state @xmath190 has vanishing quantum discord . as the density @xmath190 has also the form of the letter @xmath91 , one can use the criteria , classifying the so - called @xmath91 states with vanishing quantum discord , discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to this criteria , @xmath190 has zero quantum discord if and only if @xmath191 . the quantum discord in the state @xmath190 is in general nonzero even when entanglement suddenly disappears .",
    "this gives a special instance of separable quantum states for which the quantum discord is non zero .",
    "this agrees with the commonly accepted fact that the quantum discord is a kind of quantum correlations which goes beyond entanglement and almost all quantum states have non vanishing quantum correlations @xcite .",
    "to close this paper , let us briefly summarize the main results .",
    "our effort was devoted to investigate the evolution of quantum discord of bell cat - states under amplitude damping channel .",
    "we have derived the analytical expressions for the classical correlation and quantum discord .",
    "we discussed the usefulness of the koashi - winter relation to determine a closed form of quantum discord present in the system .",
    "we also discussed the evolution of the transmitted bell cat - states under a dephasing channel .",
    "this provides a special instance for separable mixed quantum states with non vanishing quantum discord .",
    "the method used in this paper , to derive quantum discord , constitutes an alternative way to compute analytically classical correlations and quantum discord .",
    "it can be applied easily in evaluating the quantum discord present in the other bell cat - states : @xmath192 @xmath193 @xmath194 after passing trough a amplitude damping channel .",
    "in addition , the analysis presented here for the evaluation of quantum discord is readily extended to more general systems , including squeezed states , @xmath30 and @xmath195 coherent states and so on .",
    "finally , it will be interesting to compare the quantum discord in bipartite coherent states with its geometrized version usually called in the literature geometric quantum discord @xcite .",
    "further thought in this direction might be worthwhile ."
