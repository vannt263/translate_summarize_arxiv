    "<S> we use inhomogeneous nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory to investigate the spreading of photo - excited carriers in mott insulating heterostructures with strong internal fields . </S>",
    "<S> antiferromagnetic correlations are found to affect the carrier dynamics in a crucial manner : an antiferromagnetic spin background can absorb energy from photo - excited carriers on an ultrafast timescale , thus enabling fast transport between different layers and the separation of electron and hole - like carriers , whereas in the paramagnetic state , carriers become localized in strong fields . </S>",
    "<S> this interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom can be exploited to control the functionality of devices based on mott insulating heterostructures with polar layers , e.g. , for photovoltaic applications .    </S>",
    "<S> heterostructures and interfaces of transition - metal oxides @xcite allow to exploit correlation effects on atomic length - scales for the purpose of material design , while femtosecond laser pulses can probe and manipulate the evolution of complex states of matter such as superconducting @xcite or magnetically ordered phases @xcite on microscopic timescales . </S>",
    "<S> combining ideas and techniques from both fields @xcite promises an unprecedented level of control over complex dynamical processes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in particular the intriguing nonlinear carrier dynamics in antiferromagnetic mott - insulating heterostructures which results from the interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom on femtosecond timescales . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical work on non - linear transport in correlated systems @xcite has revealed a somewhat counter - intuitive effect of dissipation on the carrier dynamics in strong fields . in a closed system , particles remain localized in a potential energy gradient , because the electronic bandwidth limits their kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> transport is thus enhanced , rather than hampered , by dissipation and the dominant scattering channel , such as phonons or magnons , defines the maximum possible current @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> related nonlinearities can be expected to affect the transport properties of heterostructures with polar layers , which can build up internal fields of order @xmath0 volt per lattice spacing @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting device where the carrier separation by strong internal fields plays an important role is the mott insulating solar cell proposed in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> its efficient operation is possible only if one can beat the rapid recombination of photo - excited carriers , which happens on much shorter ( picosecond ) timescales in mott systems than in semiconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as we will demonstrate , an ultra - fast separation of photo - induced carriers is indeed possible in antiferromagnetically ordered materials , where it relies on the capability of the spin sector to act as an  energy bank \" which can absorb and store energy on femtosecond timescales , before slowly dissipating it to the lattice and/or leads in a manner which is independent of the dynamics of the photo - doped carriers . in a spin disordered state , on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the estimated carrier separation times become comparable to typical carrier recombination times in mott insulators , even for fields approaching the electric breakdown limit of the device . </S>",
    "<S> our results also suggest a way to use spatial inhomogeneities to explore the ultrafast scattering between spins and carriers , complementary to optical spectroscopy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the nontrivial effect of the spin background on the carrier dynamics by considering a model consisting of six layers of a @xmath1-dimensional mott insulator with simple cubic lattice structure , coupled to metallic leads ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the insulator is described by a hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath2 with local coulomb repulsion @xmath3 , nearest - neighbor intra - layer hopping @xmath4 , and inter - layer hopping @xmath5 ; @xmath6 denotes the layer , and @xmath7 is the lattice coordinate within the infinitely extended @xmath8-@xmath9 plane . a static potential energy difference @xmath10 between the layers captures the effect of internal fields in the polar structure .     in the mott heterostructure with leads , for temperature @xmath11 ( paramagnetic phase ) and internal field @xmath12 ; @xmath13 is the fermi level of the external leads . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) layer - dependent density for various gradients @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) layer - dependent antiferromagnetic order for various temperatures up to the nel temperature . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) setup used to study the doublon and hole diffusion to the leads . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) setup without leads , which allows to study the spreading of doublons over a longer distance . [ fig1 ] ]    </S>",
    "<S> * methods  * to solve the electron dynamics , we use nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dmft maps a correlated lattice problem onto a self - consistently determined impurity model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main approximation in this formalism is the assumption of a spatially local self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> while spatial correlations are treated at a mean - field level , time - dependent fluctuations can be captured accurately . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the formalism is suitable for the study of nonequilibrium phenomena in lattice models . </S>",
    "<S> inhomogeneous layered structures can be treated via a mapping to a coupled set of impurity problems , each representing one layer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of the formalism and of our numerical implementation is given in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> for the translationally invariant case , and in ref .   for the inhomogeneous dmft formalism </S>",
    "<S> . to take into account antiferromagnetic order , we have implemented this formalism with a magnetic unit cell of two sites within the layers . </S>",
    "<S> metallic leads with a flat density of states are included in the formalism by adding additional lead self - energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity model is solved here using the perturbative hybridization expansion ( non - crossing approximation , nca ) @xcite . the validity of the nca for the ( photo - doped ) mott insulating phase has been addressed previously for homogeneous bulk systems . </S>",
    "<S> nca gives qualitatively the same results as higher order variants of the expansion for the current in the dielectric breakdown regime @xcite and for the relaxation of a photo - excited mott - insulator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of inhomogeneous systems in an antiferromagnetic state are numerically considerably more demanding , such that higher - order schemes ( one - crossing approximation ) are not a realistic option at this time .    </S>",
    "<S> we compute the time - evolution of various observables , in particular the ( layer - resolved ) density @xmath14 and staggered magnetization @xmath15 , with @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the photoemission spectrum @xmath17 is obtained from a convolution of the lesser component of the local , layer - resolved green s function @xmath18 with the probe - pulse envelope @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 the width @xmath21 and its inverse @xmath22 determine the time and energy resolution , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum also provides an unambiguous way to measure the density of photo - excited doublon and hole carriers , @xmath23 and @xmath24 : physically , a doublon is a resonance that is well defined only on timescales much longer than that of virtual charge fluctuations , an hence @xmath23 and @xmath24 are given by the integrated photoemission weight in the upper hubbard band and the integrated inverse photoemission weight in the lower hubbard band , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( in a nonequilibrium state with simultaneous excitation of doublons and holes , carrier densities can not be computed from the density . )     of the distributions in space . </S>",
    "<S> the heterostructure is excited at layers @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> ( e),(f ) current to the leads for various @xmath10 ( see key in panel ( h ) ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , the heterostructure is excited at all layers . </S>",
    "<S> ( g),(h ) time - integrated current @xmath26 , compared to the total photo - excited charge , for the same parameters as in ( e ) and ( f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in ( g ) shows the layer - averaged antiferromagnetic order parameter as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ]    * results  * we choose @xmath27 as the unit of energy , and take @xmath28 , such that the system becomes a mott insulator with a gap comparable to the free @xmath1-dimensional bandwidth @xmath29 . for a gap of @xmath30ev @xcite , the unit of time is thus @xmath31fs . in figure  [ fig1](a ) </S>",
    "<S> we plot the layer - resolved spectral functions of the heterostructure in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> all simulations are performed for un - biased leads . </S>",
    "<S> up to @xmath32 , where the hubbard bands at the boundary become degenerate with the fermi energy @xmath33 , the coupling to the noninteracting leads yields only a weak transfer of spectral weight into the gap region at the boundary layers , and slight hole / electron doping ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes antiferromagnetically ordered for temperatures below @xmath34 ( fig .  [ fig1](c ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the photo - excitation is simulated by a few - cycle in - plane electric field pulse with frequency @xmath35 , @xmath36 , centered around time @xmath37 ( the field is included as a peierls phase of the intra - layer hopping @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse promptly creates a small density of hole- and electron - like carriers ( doublons ) in the mott insulating structure . </S>",
    "<S> as expected for @xmath38 , we observe no recombination of photo - excited carriers within the timescale of our simulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the doublon and hole densities @xmath23 and @xmath39 under the influence of the internal field is fundamentally different in the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic structures ( fig .  [ fig2](a)-(d ) ) : in the latter , doublons and holes rapidly separate and move to the boundary layers , where they are collected by the leads . </S>",
    "<S> this process becomes faster for larger @xmath10 , as evidenced by the spatial mean @xmath40 of the distributions ( dotted lines in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a)-(d ) ) . in the paramagnetic phase , on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> we observe almost no separation of carriers beyond a polarization proportional to @xmath10 , which builds up already during the excitation ( offset between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the current @xmath43 into the leads shows a similar tendency ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](e)-(h ) ) . in the antiferromagnetic sample , </S>",
    "<S> it reaches its maximum roughly when @xmath44 of the total number of photo - excited carriers have tunneled into the leads , which takes only a few hopping times for large fields @xmath45 . in the paramagnet , </S>",
    "<S> the current starts to decrease already shortly after the pulse , when most of the photo - carriers still reside within the heterostructure . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations are limited to short times , but we can take the current at @xmath46 to estimate a lower bound for the time needed for the carriers to leave the structure . at @xmath47 , this gives @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49ps for a gap of @xmath30ev . on picosecond timescales , however , weak interactions such as couplings to optical phonons or nonlocal coulomb interactions not included in our model hamiltonian may lead to exciton formation and recombination @xcite , which would degrade the efficiency of the device .     </S>",
    "<S> ( paramagnetic ) and @xmath50 ( antiferromagnetic ) . to study the carrier motion over a longer distance </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a heterostructure which is not coupled to leads , apply the excitation at layer @xmath51 , and focus on the doublon dynamics ( holes remain trapped at the boundary ) , see sketch in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the internal field is @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line shows the spatial mean @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) velocity @xmath53 at intermediate time @xmath54 , plotted for various temperatures against the square @xmath55 of the layer - averaged staggered magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ]    to explain the striking difference between paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic samples , we first note that the decaying current in the paramagnetic sample resembles the behavior of isolated ( nonintegrable ) metals @xcite and mott insulators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , to separate doublons and holes by one layer , the charges must release an energy proportional to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> heat transport to the leads takes place , but turns out to be slow . in the antiferromagnetic phase , on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , flipping spins provides a fast channel to release this energy _ locally_. indirect evidence for an energy transfer to the spin sector is given by the decrease of the magnetization @xmath56 with time ( inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](g ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the drift velocity @xmath57 increases with @xmath55 as the temperature is decreased and the magnetic order strengthens ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . such a behavior </S>",
    "<S> may be expected because for each hopping the average number of spin - flips against the antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath56 , and hence the maximal rate of change of the spin energy @xmath59 is proportional to @xmath55 and a hopping rate .    </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed picture of the carrier dynamics can be obtained from the photoemission spectrum @xmath17 ( occupied density of states ) as a function of layer , probe time @xmath60 and frequency ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we computed @xmath17 with a time resolution of @xmath61 ( set by the probe duration ) , and an uncertainty - limited frequency resolution @xmath62 ( see methods ) . in the antiferromagnetic case </S>",
    "<S> , the initially broad energy distribution in the upper hubbard band of the excited layer ( @xmath51 ) rapidly accumulates at the lower band edge , which demonstrates the transfer of kinetic energy of photo - carriers to the spin background . </S>",
    "<S> this cooling mechanism is absent in the paramagnetic phase , and consequently , there is no significant redistribution of spectral weight within the band , as it has also been observed in homogeneous mott systems @xcite . as the carriers gradually move towards the other boundary , the spectral weight in the antiferromagnetic structure further accumulates in the lower half of the hubbard band , while it remains pinned at the same energy in the paramagnetic calculation ( thus shifting upwards within the hubbard band layer by layer ) .     of the upper hubbard band , for the same geometry as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( a)-(f ) antiferromagnetic structure at @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> ( g)-(l ) paramagnetic structure at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines indicate the center of the upper hubbard band . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ]    ) and at time @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the setup is identical to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , but @xmath64 . </S>",

    "<S> insets in ( b ) and ( d ) : density @xmath70 for the respective temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] ]    interestingly , the opposite effect is observed for the pure diffusion of carriers at @xmath64 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> diffusing carriers in the antiferromagnetic phase need kinetic energy to perturb the magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> after a short time , the spectral occupation is concentrated at the lower edge of the upper hubbard band , and further diffusion relies on much slower energy transport processes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](a),(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the high - energy tails of the distributions at early times are layer - dependent , which reveals the energy loss of carriers as they move from layer to layer . in the paramagnet , on the other hand , doublons and holes spread throughout the sample in a purely diffusive manner , and the distribution functions remain broad at all layers and times ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](c),(d ) ) .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate the decisive role of spin flip scattering for the carrier dynamics in mott heterostructures with antiferromagnetic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the spin background can act as a buffer which absorbs energy on fs timescales , and thus enables a rapid carrier separation in photovoltaic devices ( the lavo@xmath71 system proposed in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> is indeed magnetically ordered ) . in a broader context , exploiting the spin scattering and its ability to rapidly cool injected carriers may become an important design principle for devices which operate on a fs timescale . </S>",
    "<S> it can boost the transport of carriers in the strong field gradients of polar heterostructures , or significantly delay the spreading of carriers in zero field . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , inhomogeneous set - ups may be used to probe the ultra - fast exchange of energy between particles and spins : while optical excitations typically penetrate many atomic layers , photoemission can be made surface sensitive . in a heterostructure with band bending towards the surface , one can thus expect a delay between the maximum photoemission signal and the pump , which reflects the spreading of the carriers . </S>"
