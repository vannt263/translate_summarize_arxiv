    "glassy systems include such diverse materials as network glasses , polymer glasses , spin glasses , disordered metals and many colloidal systems . these materials present great challenges to theory and simulation due to a lack of long - range order and very slow , non - equilibrium dynamics",
    ". an intriguing consequence of these `` glassy dynamics '' is that the properties of glasses are not stationary but depend on the wait time @xmath0 elapsed since vitrification : this phenomenon is usually called physical aging .",
    "polymer glasses are particularly suited to studies of aging , since they exhibit comparatively low glass transition temperatures , and therefore thermally activated aging dynamics are measurable over typical experimental timescales .",
    "one of the most comprehensive studies of aging in polymer glasses was presented by struik @xcite , who showed that after a rapid quench from the melt state , there is a particularly simple evolution of the properties of the glass .",
    "the thermodynamic variables such as the energy and the density evolve logarithmically with wait time , whereas the dynamical properties such as the creep compliance exhibit scaling with the wait time @xmath1 , where the exponent @xmath2 is approximately unity .",
    "this scaling law has also been confirmed for many other glassy systems @xcite , but a clear molecular level explanantion of this behavior is still being sought .",
    "the intrinsic aging dynamics can be modified through the influence of stress and temperature @xcite . in polymer glasses ,",
    "application of a large stress usually has the effect of `` rejuvenating '' the glass : the entire spectrum of relaxation times is rescaled to shorter times , and closely resembles the spectrum of a younger state of the unperturbed glass @xcite .",
    "the term rejuvenation originated with struik s hypothesis that the application of stress increases the free - volume available for molecular rearrangements and actually results in an erasure of aging @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is still somewhat controversial @xcite , however the term persists and has come to denote any acceleration of the intrinsic aging dynamics . in colloidal systems",
    ", it has recently been shown that stress can lead to an apparent slowing down of the dynamics ( over - aging ) as well @xcite .",
    "the effects of temperature on the aging dynamics are similarly complex .",
    "it is well known that glasses age faster at higher temperatures ; however , simply taking this fact into account is not sufficient to explain the modifications of the dynamics due to changes in temperature in the glassy state @xcite .",
    "glasses have been shown to retain a memory of previous annealing temperatures @xcite , therefore , the aging dynamics generally depends on the entire thermal history of the sample @xcite . recently",
    ", a set of detailed experiments were performed on polymer glasses that experienced a temperature square step after a quench to the glassy state @xcite .",
    "results showed that the simple rescaling of time with @xmath3 no longer described the creep compliance curves , and there are significant changes to the entire spectrum of relaxation times in comparison to a sample that did not experience a temperature step .    in a previous paper , we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamics of a model polymer glass under a simple temperature quench followed by a creep experiment @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the model qualitatively reproduces the effects of aging on the creep compliance , including the phenomenon of mechanical rejuvenation at large stresses .",
    "additionally , through measurements of the two - time particle correlation functions , we showed that the aging dynamics of the creep compliance exactly corresponds to the evolution in the cage - escape time ( the time - scale for particles to undergo a significant rearrangement leading to a new local environment ) . in this work",
    ", we extend our investigation of the dynamics of aging in polymer glasses by examining the effects of a short temperature square step , modeled after the protocol of the experiments presented in ref .  @xcite . in agreement with experiment ,",
    "our simulations indicate that a downward temperature step causes rejuvenation of the relaxation times , but an upward step yields rejuvenation ( faster dynamics ) at short timescales , and over - aging ( slower dynamics ) at long timescales .",
    "in addition , we investigate the microscopic dynamics behind these relaxation phenomena through measurements of the two - time particle correlation functions and the van hove distribution functions .",
    "we perform molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations on a `` bead - spring '' polymer model that has been studied extensively for its glass - forming properties @xcite .",
    "beads interact via a non - specific van der waals potential ( lennard - jones ) , and bonds are modeled as a stiff spring ( fene ) that prevents chain crossing .",
    "the reference length - scale is @xmath4 , the diameter of the bead ; the energy scale , @xmath5 , is determined by the strength of the van der waals potential ; and the time scale is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of a bead .",
    "our simulation method is similar to the one discussed in ref .",
    "we simulate 85500 beads in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "all polymer chains have 100 beads each .",
    "this length is not much greater than the entanglement length ; however as the dynamics in glasses are very slow , reptation effects are minimal over the timescale of our simulations .",

    "two - time correlation functions are often used to measure the structural relaxations in aging glassy systems . in this study , we measure the incoherent scattering function , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the wave vector , and @xmath21 is the displacement vector of the @xmath22 atom ) as well as the mean squared displacement , @xmath23 as functions of the time @xmath16 after the wait time @xmath0 since the glass was quenched .",
    "the two - time correlation functions have two regimes : @xmath24 @xmath25 describes the unconstrained motion of particles over their mean - free path ; @xmath26 describes the dynamics at much longer timescales , where particle motions arise due to the collective relaxations of groups of particles .",

    "superposition with wait time continues to apply and the curves are simply shifted forward in time with increasing @xmath0 , although the shifts are clearly different from the reference case .",

    "the curves roll off more slowly at short wait times than long wait times , and superposition with wait time is no longer possible .    the changes in the relaxation time spectrum due to a temperature step can clearly be seen in fig .",

    "if we correct the wait time using the assumption that there is no aging at the lower temperature , @xmath47 , then the power law is restored .",
    "the aging exponents for these samples agree within the uncertainty of the fit at @xmath48 .",

    "the effect of an increase in temperature can not be described as either simple rejuvenation or over - aging , but instead the dynamics are accelerated at short times and slowed at long times .",
    "to understand the origin of the rejuvenation to over - aging transition , the relevant timescales in the protocol , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are varied for a constant step up in temperature of @xmath55 .",
    "we investigate three cases : ( 1 ) @xmath56 , ( 2 ) @xmath57 and ( 3 ) @xmath58 . the effective time with respect to the sample with no temperature step is shown for these simulation parameters at @xmath59 in fig .",

    "we clearly see rejuvenation of the short time region of the relaxation - time spectrum and a transition to over - aging at longer times ; however , the transition from rejuvenation to over - aging occurs later for case ( 2 ) ( shorter @xmath54 ) . in case ( 3 ) , there is no clear rejuvenation region at all , and at long times , the relaxation spectrum is almost identical to case ( 1 ) .    these results may be understood based on the transient dynamics at the higher temperature .",
    "the aging dynamics in glassy systems consist of spatially and temporally heterogeneous relaxation events , whereby collective motions in a group of particles lead to small rearrangements of the cage @xcite .",
    "these relaxations are often called dynamical heterogeneities @xcite . after a first relaxation event ( cage escape )",
    ", it has been shown that the timescale for subsequent relaxations is shorter , and a typical group of atoms will experience many such events before finding a stable configuration @xcite . because the aging dynamics are thermally activated , immediately after the temperature of the glass is raised , the total rate of relaxation events rapidly increases and persists for a time which is related to the `` life - time '' of the mobile regions .",
    "once these regions finally stabilize , the resulting structure has a lower energy than before , or an over - population of long relaxation times .",
    "overall , as also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the greater rate of transitions at this temperature leads to accelerated aging with respect to a glass at the lower temperature .",
    "the results of our simulations after a temperature square step can then be understood as a competition between the initial rejuvenation due to the dynamical heterogeneities , and the over - aging that results when once they have stabilized .",
    "therefore , a short temperature square step causes mostly rejuvenation , and long temperature steps show primarily over - aging .",
    "this picture is generally consistent with that of trap models @xcite that generate glassy dynamics through a wide distribution of relaxation times . however , ref .",
    "@xcite found that such models do not explain all aspects of the thermal cycling experiment since they do not address the spatial arrangement of the relaxation processes .",
    "it is curious that the long time part of the relaxation spectrum is the same for case ( 1 ) and case ( 3 ) .",
    "this may indicate the end of the rapid transient effects , and the beginning of more steady aging in the glass at the higher temperature",
    ". it would be useful to expand the study to even longer @xmath54 to investigate this finding .",

    "results show excellent agreement with experiment .",

    "a positive temperature step yields a completely different relaxation spectrum : at short times the dynamics are accelerated ( rejuvenation ) , and at long times they are slowed ( over - aging ) . by modifying the length of the step up in temperature , we determined that the transition from rejuvenation to over - aging is controlled by the length of the square step : short steps cause primarily rejuvenation , while long steps show marked over - aging .",
