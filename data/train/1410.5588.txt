    "recently , ban@xmath2dos - silk - west ( bsw ) @xcite studied collision of two particles ( e.g. dark matter particles ) in the vicinity of the horizon of the kerr black hole ( bh ) and found that center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of the colliding particles in the equatorial plane can be arbitrarily high in the limiting case of extremal bh .",
    "this imply that the extremal rotating bh may be considered as a planck energy scale particle accelerator , which might allow us to explore ultra high energy collisions and astrophysical phenomena , such as the gamma ray bursts and the active galactic nuclei . in the work of bsw @xcite , two particles of equal mass and equal energy falling freely from rest at infinity and approaching the extremal kerr bh on the equatorial plane were considered .",
    "the energy in the cm frame was computed and the critical value of the particle angular momentum at which the energy blows up were determined .",
    "however , jacobson and sotiriou @xcite elucidate the mechanism for this result , and point out its practical limitations given that extremal bhs do not exist in nature , e.g. , the spin @xmath0 of astrophysical bhs should not exceed @xmath3 @xcite ( @xmath4 is the mass of the bh ) . in any case , the `` third law '' of bh thermodynamics ( bardeen et al . 1973 ) asserts that a bh can not be spun - up in a finite time to the extreme spin value @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , jacobson and sotiriou @xcite demonstrated that infinite collision energy can only be attained at the horizon , and with a maximally spinning bh .",
    "lake @xcite also demonstrated that the cm energy of colliding particle near the inner horizon of a non - extremal kerr bh is finite .",
    "it is known that the motion of a particle traveling in the background of a charged spinning bh depends not only on the spin but also on the charge of the bh .",
    "therefore , the cm energy of collision expected to depend both on spin and charge .",
    "the bsw scenario is generalized to charged bhs @xcite , the kerr - newman family of bhs @xcite and general rotating bhs @xcite .",
    "it is shown that , for a near - extremal charged bh , there always exists a finite upper bound for cm energy , which decreases with the increase of the charge @xmath6 .",
    "the bsw effect near the event horizon of the kerr - taub - nut bh was investigated by @xcite , around the kaluza - klein ( extremal ) bh in @xcite and found the infinitely large cm energy near the horizon in both rotating and non - rotating cases .",
    "the bsw effect for the einstein - maxwell - dilaton - axion bh @xcite , and the btz bh was discussed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the cm energy was generalized for charged particles moving in an electromagnetic field and braneworld bhs were discussed . even for nonmaximally rotating bhs , grib and",
    "pavlov @xcite argued that the cm energy for two particles collision can be unlimited for the non - maximal rotation as well when one considers the multiple scattering . a general explanation for the arbitrarily high cm energy is presented in terms of the killing vectors and the killing horizon by zaslavskii @xcite .",
    "further , the author @xcite clarified that the universal property of acceleration of particles near rotating bhs and give a general argument of this bsw mechanism for the general rotating bhs .",
    "further , joshi and patil @xcite found that the cm energy to be high for the naked singularity of the kerr bh and other bhs @xcite .",
    "more recently , bsw mechanism is used to calculate the cm energy of collision for two particles freely falling , from rest at infinity , in the horizon of a ayn - beato - garca ( abg ) bh @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the cm energy for abg bh can be infinitely high for the extremal case @xcite .",
    "the rotating counterpart of abg bh is another interesting and important spacetime @xcite , which is a solution of einstein equations coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics . besides the mass m and the rotation parameter @xmath0 , the rotating abg spacetime carries with the charge , @xmath1 .",
    "it is widely believed that spacetime singularities do not exist in nature , but that they represent a limitation of the classical theory . while we do not yet have any solid theory of quantum gravity models of bh solutions without singularities",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these spacetimes have an event horizon and no pathological features like singularities or regions with closed timelike curves .",
    "the rotating abg metrics are more important as they can be tested by astrophysical observations , as the bh spin plays a fundamental role in any astrophysical process @xcite .",
    "the rotating abg black hole are axisymmetric , asymptotically flat and depend on the mass and spin of the black hole as well as on a parameter @xmath1 that measure potential deviations from the kerr metric .",
    "the rotating abg metric includes the kerr metric as the special case if this deviation parameter vanishes .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the collision of two particles in the background of the rotating abg spacetime and to see what the effects of the charge @xmath1 on the cm energy for the particles in the near - horizon collision .",
    "it turns out that our results can be reduced to the ones of bsw @xcite as the charge parameter turns to zero and nonrotating abg bh when the rotation parameter @xmath7 . besides",
    ", we may be more interest to discuss cm energy of the rotating abg bh because it does not have a simple horizon structure as the previous studied bhs .",
    "in this section , we would like to study the rotating abg bhs .",
    "the gravitational field of rotating abg spacetime  @xcite is described by metric which in the boyer - lindquist coordinates with units @xmath8 is given by @xmath9d\\phi^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath14 and @xmath1 are respectively correspond to rotation , mass and the electric charge .",
    "we shall demonstrate that , for certain range of values of @xmath14 and @xmath1 , the metric ( [ abg ] ) is a bh .",
    "the curvature invariant @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the metric ( [ abg ] ) reveals that the rotating abg bh is regular everywhere for @xmath18 .",
    "the metric ( [ abg ] ) is a non - singular rotating charged bh which generalizes the standard kerr bh .",
    "in addition , if @xmath19 the metric ( [ abg ] ) reduce to kerr bh @xcite .",
    "further when both @xmath20 the metric ( [ abg ] ) is schwarzchild bh @xcite .",
    "if @xmath21 we have an exact abg bh @xcite which is a solution of einstein field equations coupled to the nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "we know that the kerr bh has two horizons like surfaces : static limit surface and event horizon .",
    "we are interested in these two surfaces for the rotating abg spacetime metric ( [ abg ] ) .",
    "we start with calculating location and structure of static limit surface which requires the prefactor of @xmath22 to vanish .",
    "then it follows from ( [ abg ] ) that the static limit surface will satisfy @xmath23 the eq .",
    "( [ sls ] ) for @xmath19 becomes exactly same as kerr @xcite .",
    "the surface of no return is known as the event horizon . beyond event horizon",
    "the gravitational force becomes so high that it is impossible for any object , even light to escape from the gravity of the bh .",
    "the spacetime ( [ abg ] ) generically must have two horizons , viz . , the inner or cauchy horizon and the outer or event horizon .",
    "the horizons of the bh ( [ abg ] ) are calculated by equating the @xmath24 component of the metric ( [ abg ] ) to zero , i.e. ,    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      a bh is called non - extremal when the outer and inner horizons are not coincide , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "we find the range of angular momentum of particles by solving eq .",
    "( [ lim ] ) numerically .",
    "the maximum / minimum angular momentum we are looking for non - extremal bh are listed in table ( [ table2 ] ) .",
    "we can see the behavior of cm energy for non - extremal bh from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show the variation of @xmath26 vs @xmath27 for different values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 with fixed values of spin parameter @xmath0 and charge @xmath1 . here",
    ", we can see that @xmath26 is finite at the event horizon . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we show the variation of @xmath26 vs @xmath0 at the outer horizon for different values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 with fixed values of charge @xmath1 .",
    "the variation of @xmath26 vs @xmath27 for different values of @xmath1 can be seen in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] and @xmath26 vs @xmath0 in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "we have also plot the variation of @xmath26 for kerr bh in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] and in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "( [ ecm ] ) confirms that the non - linear charge @xmath1 indeed has influence on the cm energy . in the limit @xmath21 , eq .",
    "( [ ecm ] ) reduces to expression for @xmath26 of abg bh ,    @xmath30.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is exactly same as obtained in @xcite .",
    "further , @xmath26 for the kerr bh @xcite can be obtained by taking limit @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ ecm ] ) , which reads    @xmath32.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it turns out that eq .",
    "( [ ecm2 ] ) the @xmath33 blows up at the horizon in the extremal case @xcite .",
    "we are far from a reliable candidate for a quantum theory of gravity , hence recently more attention is given for phenomenological approaches to somehow solve these singularity problem in classical general relativity and study possible implications . in this context , an important line of research is represented by the work on the regular bh solutions .",
    "hence , we have investigated the collision of two particles falling freely from rest at infinity in the background of a rotating regular abg bh .",
    "it was demonstrated by bsw @xcite that cm energy of two colliding particles near the horizon of an extremal kerr bh can be arbitrarily high value under some restriction on the angular momentum of particles . the analysis of bsw when extended to rotating abg bh to investigate the cm energy @xmath26 for two particles , an unlimited @xmath26 that constraints on the charge @xmath1 and rotation parameter @xmath0 . from the point of view of bsw mechanism",
    "the cm energy for two colliding particles for extremal bh should be arbitrarily high . so that we have found critical value of the angular momentum for which the cm energy of colliding particles is arbitrarily high near the horizon ( extremal bh ) .",
    "we have also seen that when the angular momentum of the colliding particles is not critical ( non - extremal bh ) the cm energy is finite .",
    "for the non - extremal case , we find that the cm energy @xmath26 increases with increase in the charge @xmath1 .",
    "the range of the angular momentum @xmath34 and the spin parameter @xmath0 increases for the rotating abg bh as compared with the kerr - newman bh .",
    "the cm energy @xmath26 for the extremal rotating abg bh case is infinite at @xmath35 while for the extremal kerr bh case the cm energy @xmath26 is infinite at @xmath36 .    indeed , to obtain an arbitrary high @xmath26 , besides the conditions that the bh is an extremal bh , and one of the particle has critical angular momentum , one still has restriction on the charge @xmath1 .",
    "it may be pointed out that horizon structure of the rotating abg bhs is significantly complicated to analyze analytically and hence we turn to numerically methods to analyze @xmath26 , the range of the angular momentum , with which particle can reach horizon and fall into bh .",
    "it turns out that if the angular momentum of a particle lies outside the range , it will not fall into the bh and no collision will take place .",
    "we have also estimated the @xmath26 for non - extremal rotating abg bh case , and found that the @xmath26 is always finite and significantly affected by charge @xmath1 and rotation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it will be of interest to extend the analysis discussed to other regular bh , which will be determine whether these properties of regular bhs are generic .",
    "these and related work are subject of forthcoming papers .                                                                    c.  bambi , mod .",
