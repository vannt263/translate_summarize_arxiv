    "since statistical field theory was first applied to self avoiding polymers by edwards  @xcite , polymer field theory models and techniques have been developed and refined for a wide variety of polymeric systems  @xcite . in the field theoretic approach ,",
    "one often has to invoke approximations in order to make functional integrals for partition functions and average properties tractable .",
    "a convenient starting point is the mean field approximation , also known as _ self - consistent field theory _ ( scft )  @xcite .",
    "since the effective coordination number grows as the square root of the molecular weight in concentrated polymeric systems , scft is argued to be asymptotically exact in polymeric melts when the degree of polymerization becomes infinite .",
    "moreover , the theory serves as the reference for more sophisticated approximation schemes that attempt to account for field fluctuation effects  @xcite . over the last decade , with the ever increasing power of digital computation , numerical scft has become a routine tool for investigations of the structural and thermodynamic properties of inhomogeneous polymers , including polymer alloys and block copolymers of varying architecture  @xcite .    despite the success and the popularity of scft among polymer researchers , there are classes of systems where scft is known to be inaccurate  @xcite .",
    "these systems , characterized by strong or non - negligible density fluctuations , include polymer solutions in dilute and semi - dilute regimes , systems close to a phase transition , and polyelectrolyte solutions , among others .",
    "the mean field approximation ( i.e. scft ) is particularly ill - suited to polyelectrolytes ; indeed , for some charged polymer systems the coulomb interaction does not contribute to the free energy at the scft level .",
    "such a system is a homogeneous polyelectrolyte solution of arbitrary concentration in the bulk .",
    "the overall charge neutrality condition of the system leads to a constant self - consistent electrostatic potential field that makes no contribution to the free energy of the solution .",
    "hence , in such a system the electrostatics contributes to the free energy only via positional _ correlations _ among charges .",
    "such charge correlations can be very strong in polyelectrolytes due to the high valency and the low translational entropy of macroions .",
    "this strong charge correlation effect in polyelectrolytes was noticed nearly a century ago  @xcite : mixtures of oppositely charged biopolymers or synthetic polyelectrolytes can yield dense liquid precipitates coexisting with supernatant solvent under standard physiological conditions at room temperature .",
    "this liquid - liquid phase separation , referred to as _ complex coacervation _",
    ", is a manifestation of charge correlations and fundamentally differs from the macrophase separation that typically occurs in solutions or melts of incompatible neutral polymers .",
    "applications of complex coacervates exist in both nature and technology . as an elegant example of the former , the `` sand castle '' worm constructs habitats on the meter length scale by gluing millimeter - sized grains of sand together under the sea using a wonder glue composed of anionic and cationic proteins  @xcite .",
    "technological applications span the fields of water purification , adhesives , coatings , and biotechnology .",
    "for example , dna sensors are being developed based on the complexation of target dna molecules ( anionic ) with synthetic conjugated cationic polyelectrolytes  @xcite .",
    "other potential applications in biotechnology relate to drug delivery and gene therapy , and invoke charge complexation to build useful structures with a payload ( such as dna ) for delivery in an aqueous environment .",
    "an example of such a structure is the self - assembled polymeric micelles produced by mixing solutions of polyanions and polycations , where one or both polyelectrolytes contains a charge neutral hydrophilic block  @xcite .",
    "the core of each micelle is a coacervate composed of negatively and positively charged polymer segments , while the corona consists of water soluble neutral blocks that can serve to protect the payload in the core .",
    "theoretically , the thermodynamics of complex coacervation was first examined by overbeek and voorn  @xcite .",
    "although they correctly identified the driving force for the phase separation as a coulomb attraction between oppositely charged macroions , they neglected the charge connectivity along the polymer backbone and relied on the simple debye - hckel approximation in calculating the electrostatic free energy , which is valid only in very dilute systems  @xcite . since that time",
    ", the main issue in the theory of complex coacervation has been how to properly calculate the electrostatic charge correlation in polyelectrolyte solutions .",
    "following the maturation of polymer field theory , significant progress in our understanding of charge correlation phenomena have resulted from application of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to weakly charged polyelectrolytes  @xcite , and loop expansions to treat stronger correlations beyond the level of the rpa  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately these analytical techniques are still limited in scope and are particularly difficult to apply to _ inhomogeneous _ structures , such as mesophases .",
    "the pervasiveness and the importance of polyelectrolyte systems in nature and biological applications , coupled with the obvious inadequacy of scft in describing those systems , motivates the development of a systematic _ numerical _ way of incorporating field fluctuation effects beyond scft .",
    "ideally , such a scheme should be capable of treating an arbitrary field theory model in the absence of any approximations ( aside from numerical errors that arise from resolving and statistically sampling the fields ) , and thus be capable of describing strong charge and density correlation effects . beyond serving as a general purpose simulation tool",
    ", such a `` field theoretic simulation '' method could be used as a test bed to validate analytical results based on loop expansions and other approximations .",
    "our group has developed a broad suite of methods for conducting numerical simulations of polymer statistical field theory models  @xcite .",
    "since the models typically have effective hamiltonians that are complex , rather than real , phase oscillations thwart conventional numerical simulations based on monte carlo sampling .",
    "we have found that this `` sign problem '' can be effectively treated by adopting the complex langevin ( cl ) sampling method from nuclear physics  @xcite , and applying it in tandem with advanced numerical methods .",
    "this emerging field of _ field theoretic simulations _ ( _ fts _ ) of polymeric systems has already been applied to several polymer models where scft is known to be inaccurate , such as block copolymers near their order - disorder transition ( odt )  @xcite , ternary blends close to a lifshitz point  @xcite , and polymer solutions in the semidilute regime  @xcite .",
    "the fts technique , however , is generic enough to be applicable to a much broader class of field theory models of complex fluids , and is potentially expandable to systems out of equilibrium  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we report on the application of fts to polyelectrolyte systems . based on a field theoretic model of a simple binary polyelectrolyte mixture",
    ", fts is used to study density correlations in the system and to directly monitor the complexation phenomena that leads to the formation of a coacervate .",
    "we recently contributed a short highlight article that included some preliminary findings  @xcite . here",
    "we provide a more complete set of results , a detailed discussion of our model and numerical methods , and an in - depth analysis",
    ". a particular focus of the present paper is on charge and density correlations in the solution .",
    "structure factors of segment density and charge density are calculated using fts and compared with rpa structure factors .",
    "in this section , the field theory of our model polyelectrolyte solution is introduced .",
    "the thermodynamics of the system in the mean field approximation is studied , followed by a discussion of the first non - vanishing ( rpa ) correction to scft assuming small amplitude field fluctuations .",
    "next , the fts technique is described along with cl sampling .",
    "the section ends with a discussion of the numerical methods used to integrate the cl equations .",
    "here we propose a simple , yet fundamental , model that is capable of giving rise to the phenomenon of complex coacervation with a minimal set of parameters .",
    "specifically , we consider a solution consisting of a mixture of polycations and polyanions in an implicit good solvent with a uniform dielectric constant @xmath0 . for simplicity , we choose to work with a _",
    "symmetric _ model in which the two types of polyelectrolytes are identical except for the sign of the charge that they carry .",
    "half of chain molecules in the system are positively charged and the other half are negatively charged , thereby preserving the condition of electroneutrality . again , for simplicity , we do not include either counterions or salt , although such generalizations are straightforward . our highly idealized model system , however , could be approximately realized by mixing a polyacid with a polybase of equal molecular weight and equal but opposite charge in water .",

    "specifically , we built and numerically simulated a field theory model of a salt - free solution containing a symmetric mixture of flexible polyanions and polycations in a good solvent .",
    "this particular system constitutes a minimal model for the phenomenon of complex coacervation , a type of liquid - liquid phase separation in which a nearly pure solvent phase coexists with second fluid phase ( the `` coacervate '' ) that contains the majority of the polyelectrolytes . theoretically , the symmetric coacervate model is interesting because the workhorse tool of polymer physics , self - consistent field theory ( scft ) , fails to describe the electrostatic effects responsible for coacervation .",
    "previous analytical work on closely related models of polyelectrolyte mixtures has shown that complex coacervation can be predicted based on calculations that assume weak , gaussian field fluctuations , i.e. calculations at the one - loop level of fluctuation expansion  @xcite .",
    "however , the reliability of these predictions have remained unclear because analytical techniques for treating more realistic situations of strong charge and excluded volume correlations are lacking . the fts results of our paper are significant because they can provide numerical data to assess the validity of the rpa , both in terms of its predictions for charge and segment density correlations and for the location of the two - phase envelope .",
    "overall , we have found that the rpa is remarkably robust in its predictions , except at very high charge densities ( large values of the parameter @xmath117 ) where it overestimates the strength of charge correlations and the size of the two - phase region .",
    "perhaps more significantly , our results have validated the emerging field theoretic polymer simulation technique as a powerful new tool for examining the structure and thermodynamics of polyelectrolyte systems .",
    "fts can be applied even in situations where the rpa is inapplicable or technically very difficult , such as cases of mesophases formed by weakly charged polymers with hydrophobic backbones or block co - polyelectrolytes  @xcite .",
    "complexation of charged polymers that also contain neutral blocks or grafts ( which can be either hydrophobic or hydrophilic ) can also produce inhomogeneous `` structured coacervate '' phases that are not amenable to study by current theoretical methods  @xcite .",
    "we expect that fts will prove to be a valuable tool for exploring these and related types of polyelectrolyte systems .",
