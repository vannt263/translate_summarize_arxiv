    "it is a well kept secret that the theory of kac - moody algebras has been a disaster .",
    "true , it is a generalization of a very important object , the simple finite - dimensional lie algebras , but a generalization too straightforward to expect anything interesting from it .",
    "true , it is remarkable how far one can go with all these @xmath0 s , @xmath1 s and @xmath2 s .",
    "practically all , even most difficult results of finite - dimensional theory , such as the theory of characters , schubert calculus and cohomology theory , have been extended to the general set - up of kac - moody algebras .",
    "but the answer to the most important question is missing : what are these algebras good for ?",
    "even the most sophisticated results , like the connections to the theory of quivers , seem to be just scratching the surface .    however , there are two notable exceptions .",
    "the best known one is , of course , the theory of affine kac - moody algebras .",
    "this part of the kac - moody theory has deeply penetrated many branches of mathematics and physics .",
    "the most important single reason for this success is undoubtedly the isomorphism of affine algebras and central extensions of loop algebras , often called current algebras .",
    "the second notable exception is provided by borcherds algebras which are roughly speaking the spaces of physical states of certain chiral algebras .    at this point",
    "a natural question arises : what do these notable exceptions have in common ?",
    "the answer , in my opinion , lies in the idea of locality .",
    "the concept of locality is a beautiful synthesis of three ideas :    1 .",
    "einstein s special relativity postulate , 2 .   heisenberg s uncertainty principle , 3 .",
    "the notion of quantum field .",
    "as far as i know , the concept of locality was first rigorously formulated by pauli and then incorporated by wightman in his axiomatics of quantum field theory .",
    "the locality axiom states that quantum fields , whose supports are space - like separated , must commute .",
    "the locality axiom is empty for @xmath3-dimensional space - time , but becomes a very complicated condition for higher - dimensional space - times .",
    "however , in the @xmath4-dimensional case the light cone is a union of two straight lines and one may consider chiral quantum fields , that is , fields depending on one null coordinate .    for chiral fields the locality axiom reduces to a very simple algebraic condition .",
    "it just states that the commutator of chiral fields is a finite linear combination , with coefficients being chiral fields , of the delta - function and its derivatives .",
    "coming back to our two notable exceptions , we see that both are spanned by fourier coefficients of pairwise local chiral fields !    now ,",
    "if we look around , we will immediately find that all the important lie algebras ( or superalgebras ) satisfy this locality property : the virasoro algebra and its marvelous super generalizations , the @xmath5-algebras , the lie algebra @xmath6 , etc .",
    "this leads us to the program of study of lie algebras and superalgebras satisfying the sole locality property .",
    "it is an extensive program , but i hope that its main features will be worked out by the year 2000 .",
    "the basic message i wanted to convey by my speech is this . some of the best ideas come to my field from the physicists . and",
    "on top of this they award me a medal .",
    "one could nt hope for a better deal .",
