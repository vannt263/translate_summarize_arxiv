    "the transmission eigenvalue problem ( te ) @xcite has important applications in inverse scattering theory for inhomogeneous media .",
    "the problem is non - selfadjoint and not covered by standard partial differential equation theory .",
    "transmission eigenvalues have received significant attention in a variety of inverse problems for target identification and nondestructive testing since they provide information concerning physical properties of the target .    since",
    "2010 significant effort has been focused on developing effective numerical methods for transmission eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "the first numerical treatment appeared in @xcite , where three finite element methods were proposed . a mixed method ( without a convergence proof )",
    "was developed in @xcite .",
    "an and shen @xcite proposed an efficient spectral - element based numerical method for transmission eigenvalues of two - dimensional , radially - stratified media .",
    "the first method supported by a rigorous convergence analysis was introduced in @xcite . in this article transmission eigenvalues",
    "are computed as roots of a nonlinear function whose values are eigenvalues of a related positive definite fourth order problem .",
    "this method has two drawbacks 1 ) only real transmission eigenvalues can be obtained , and 2 ) many fourth order eigenvalue problems need to be solved . in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) surface integral and contour integral based methods are used to compute both real and complex transmission eigenvalues in the special case when the index of refraction is constant .",
    "recently , cakoni et.al .",
    "@xcite reformulated the problem and proved convergence ( based on osborn s compact operator theory @xcite ) of a mixed finite element method .",
    "@xcite developed a finite element method based on writing the te as a quadratic eigenvalue problem .",
    "some non - traditional methods , including the linear sampling method in the inverse scattering theory @xcite and the inside - out duality @xcite , were proposed to search for eigenvalues using scattering data . however , these methods seem to be computationally prohibitive since they rely on solving tremendous numbers direct problems . other methods @xcite and the related source problem @xcite have been discussed in the literature .    in general , developing effective finite element methods for transmission eigenvalues is challenging because it is a quadratic , typically , degenerate , non - selfadjoint eigenvalue problem for a system of two second order partial differential equations and despite some qualitative estimates the spectrum is largely unknown . in most cases ,",
    "the continuous problem is degenerate with an infinite dimensional eigenspace associated with a zero eigenvalue .",
    "the system can be reduced to a single fourth order problem however conforming finite elements for such problems _",
    "argyris are expensive .",
    "straightforward finite element discretizations generate computationally challenging large sparse non - hermitian matrix eigenvalue problems .",
    "traditional methods such as shift and invert arnoldi are handicapped by the lack of a priori eigenvalue estimates . to summarize , finite element discretizations of transmission eigenvalue problems generate large , sparse , typically highly degenerate , non - hermitian matrix eigenvalue problems with little a priori spectral information beyond the likelihood of a relatively high - dimensional nullspace .",
    "these characteristics suggest that most existing eigenvalue solver are unsuitable for transmission eigenvalues .",
    "recently integral based methods @xcite related to the earlier work @xcite and originally developed for electronic structure calculations become popular .",
    "these methods are based on eigenprojections @xcite provided by contour integrals of the resolvent @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a recursive integral method ( * rim * ) to compute transmission eigenvalues from a continuous finite element discretization .",
    "regions in the complex plane are searched for eigenvalues using approximate eigenprojections onto the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalues within the region .",
    "the approximate eigenprojections are generated by approximating the resolvent contour integral around the boundary of the region by a quadrature on a random sample .",
    "the region is subdivided and subregions containing eigenvalues are recursively subdivided until the eigenvalues are localized to the desired tolerance . *",
    "rim * is designed to approximate all eigenvalues within a specific region without resolving eigenvectors .",
    "this is well suited to the transmission eigenvalue problem which typically seeks only the eigenvalues near but not at the origin .",
    "the degenerate non - hermitian nature of the matrix and the complicated unknown structure of the spectrum are not an issue .",
    "* rim * is distinguished from other integral methods in literature by several features .",
    "first , the method works for hermitian and non - hermitian generalized eigenvalue problems such as those from the discretization of non - selfadjoint partial differential equations .",
    "second , the recursive procedure automatically resolves eigenvalues near region boundaries and minimally separated eigenvalue pairs .",
    "third , the method requires only linear solves with no need to explicitly form a matrix inverse .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the transmission eigenvalue problem , the finite element discretization , and the resulting large sparse non - hermitian generalized matrix eigenvalue problem .",
