    "systems of coupled oscillators can describe problems in physics , chemistry , biology , neuroscience and other disciplines .",
    "they have been widely used to model several phenomena such as : josephson junction arrays , multimode lasers , vortex dynamics in fluids , biological information processes , neurodynamics @xcite .",
    "these systems have been observed to synchronize themselves to a common frequency , when the coupling strength between these oscillators is increased @xcite .",
    "the synchronization features of many of the above mentioned systems , in spite of the diversity of the dynamics , might be described using simple models of weakly coupled phase oscillators such as the kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "finite range interactions are more realistic for the description of many physical systems , although finite range coupled systems are difficult to analyze and to solve analytically . however , in order to figure out the collective phenomena when finite range interactions are considered , it is of fundamental importance to study and to understand the nearest neighbour interactions , which is the simplest form of the local interactions . in this context , a simplified version of the kuramoto model with nearest neighbour coupling in a ring topology , which we shall refer to as _ locally coupled kuramoto model _ ( lckm ) , represents a good candidate to describe the dynamics of coupled systems with local interactions such as josephson junctions , coupled lasers , neurons , chains with disorders , multi - cellular systems in biology and in communication systems @xcite . for instance , it has been shown that the equations of the resistively shunted junction which describe a ladder array of overdamped , critical - current disordered josephson junctions that are current biased along the rungs of the ladder can be expressed by a lckm @xcite . in nearest neighbours",
    "coupled rssler oscillators the phase synchronization can be described by the lckm @xcite . therefore , lckm can provide a way to understand phase synchronization in coupled systems , for example , in locally coupled lasers @xcite , where local interactions are dominant .",
    "coupled phase oscillators described by lckm can also be used to model the occurrence of travelling waves in neurons @xcite . in communication systems",
    ", unidirectionally coupled kuramoto model can be used to describe an antenna array  @xcite .",
    "such unidirectionally coupled kuramoto models can be considered as a special case of the lckm and it often mimics the same behaviour .",
    "one of the important features of the local model is that the properties of individual oscillators can be easily analyzed to study the collective dynamics while one has to rely on the average quantities , in a mean field approximation or by means of an order parameter , etc .",
    ", as in the case of the usual kuramoto model of long range interactions .",
    "therefore , due to the difficulty in applying standard techniques of statistical mechanics , one should look for a simple approach to understand the coupled system with local interactions by means of numerical study of a temporal behaviour of the individual oscillators .",
    "such analysis is necessary in order to get a close picture on the effect of the local interactions on synchronization . in this case",
    ", numerical investigations can assist to figure out the mechanism of interactions at the stage of complete synchronization which in turns help to get an analytic solution .",
    "earlier studies on the lckm show several interesting features including tree structures with synchronized clusters , phase slips , bursting behaviour and saddle node bifurcation and so on @xcite .",
    "there have been studies showing that neighbouring elements share dominating frequencies in their time spectra , and that this feature plays an important role in the dynamics of formation of clusters in the local model @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the order parameter , which measures the evolution of the phases of the nearest neighbour oscillators , becomes maximum at the partial synchronization points inside the tree of synchronization @xcite .",
    "very recently we developed a scheme based on the method of lagrange multipliers to estimate the critical coupling strength for complete synchronization in the local kuramoto model with different boundary conditions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the mechanism that leads to a complete synchronization in the kuramoto model with local coupling .",
    "this is done by analyzing the behaviour of each individual oscillators at the onset of synchronization . for this purpose",
    "we consider the equations governing the phase differences at the onset of synchronization .",
    "in particular , we identify that the cosine of only one among the phase differences becomes zero . based on this property",
    "we derive the expression for the time interval between bursting behaviour of the instantaneous frequencies of each individual oscillators in the vicinity of critical coupling strength .",
    "our analysis shows that the transition to complete synchronization occurs due to a saddle node bifurcation in agreement with the earlier studies .",
    "further we deduce the expressions for the phases and frequencies of the individual oscillators at the onset of complete synchronization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ mechanism ] we present a brief overview on the dynamics of local kuramoto model .",
    "then we analyze the behaviour of the phase differences and the time interval between successive bursts at the transition to complete synchronization .",
    "in particular , we point out the mechanism that lead to complete phase locking at the critical coupling strength . based on this",
    "we deduce the forms of phases and frequencies at the onset of synchronization . finally , in sec .",
    "[ finalwords ] we give a summary of the results and conclusions .",
    "even when there has been an extensive exploration of the dynamics of the kuramoto model ( global coupling among all oscillators ) , the local model of nearest neighbour interactions , which can be considered as a diffusive version of the kuramoto model , has been receiving attention only recently .",

    "many interesting features of the lckm remain unknown , especially an analytic solution @xcite , which would be of great importance in understanding the mechanism that leads to synchronization . in order to find such an analytic solution",
    ", one should study carefully the temporal evolution of frequency and phase of each individual oscillator in the neighbourhood of the critical coupling for complete synchronization .    if we consider the oscillators in a ring , with periodic boundary conditions @xmath6 , the nonidentical oscillators ( [ kura : theta ] ) cluster in time averaged frequency , until they completely synchronize to a common value of the average frequency @xmath7 , at a critical coupling @xmath8 @xcite",

    "this fact has been used by daniels et al @xcite to estimate the value of critical coupling strength @xmath8 , at which the transition to complete synchronization occurs .",
    "however the determination of which two oscillators among @xmath23 oscillators that have @xmath24 , remains difficult . from the study of the temporal evolution of phases and frequencies of each individual oscillator",
    ", it has also been found numerically that , at the onset of synchronization @xmath25 , the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 remain equal to @xmath28 and zero , respectively , for a certain time interval @xmath29 . during this time",
    "@xmath29 a stable phase - locked solution exists , then they burst @xcite , and this stable phase - locked solution is lost . in between bursts ,",
    "the phases remain fixed and then they have an abrupt change ( phase - slip behaviour ) by an amount which depends on the initial values of the frequencies @xmath30 @xcite , corresponding to the burst in the frequencies , while the quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are always preserved by the topology . integrated with the above information , it has been shown by numerical investigation that the time interval @xmath29 blows up as @xmath2 becomes close to @xmath8 and @xmath33 at @xmath8 .",
    "all these information leads to conclude that there is a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath8 and the synchronization - desynchronization transition at the critical coupling can be interpreted using this knowledge .    in this work ,",
    "we perform numerical investigations of the temporal evolution of the phases and frequencies for the individual oscillators in order to arrive to specific conditions which will lead to criteria to obtain an analytic solution .",
    "a detailed study of all quantities @xmath34 at @xmath8 for several values of @xmath23 and for different sets of @xmath1 , shows that there is only one value of phase difference between two neighbouring oscillators @xmath35 for which @xmath24 , while for all other values , @xmath36 @xmath37 .     at @xmath9 for a system of @xmath38 oscillators",

    "henceforward , we argue that it is the behaviour of @xmath55 and @xmath89 , which drives the system to fall into full synchronization .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the conditions on the phase differences for the onset of complete synchronization at the critical coupling strength in a kuramoto - like model with nearest neighbour coupling .",

    "in such cases , a detailed study of the time evolution of amplitudes and phases can reveal a better understanding of the mechanism of synchronization .",
    "the present analysis can also be applicable to models in higher dimensions such as that for dislocations in solids which includes local nearest neighbour interactions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the present approach can be extended to understand the underlying mechanism in the case of locally coupled kuramoto models with time delay @xcite ( or phase delay ) introduced between the coupled oscillators .",
