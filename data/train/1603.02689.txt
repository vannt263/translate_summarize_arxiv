    "in recent years , multi - wavelength surveys at high redshift have revealed a significant evolution of galaxies from redshift @xmath8 to the present epoch .",
    "the emerging picture is based on a few key observations .",
    "first , the star formation rates ( sfrs ) of galaxies have declined by a factor of 10 in the last 10 billion years .",
    "different observational techniques agree that this trend is largely independent of mass ( damen et al .",
    "2009 , karim et al .",
    "2011 , fumagalli et al .",
    "this decline is accompanied by the evolution of the mass function , that once split into star - forming and quiescent population reveals a differential behavior for the two categories : while the number of massive star - forming galaxies remains constant or even declines , the number density of massive quiescent galaxies grows by 0.5 - 1.0 dex from @xmath92 ( muzzin et al .",
    "2013 , ilbert et al .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the quiescent fraction at the massive end becomes increasingly larger at lower redshifts ( bell et al . 2007 ;",
    "bundy et al .",
    "2006 , brammer et al 2011 ) . while at lower redshift massive galaxies ( @xmath10 ) are dominated by a homogenous group of quiescent , red , early - type objects ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; blanton et al . 2003 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a ) , at redshift z@xmath111 the population shows a large diversity of colors , structural parameters and sfrs ( abraham et al . 2004 , van dokkum et al .",
    ", 2011 ) .",
    "an additional insight into the assembly history of galaxies is given by their stellar population parameters , namely their age and metallicity .",
    "in the local universe the light - weighted ages and metallicities ( both stellar and gaseous ) have been shown to correlate tightly with mass ( e.g. tremonti et al .",
    "2004 , gallazzi et al .",
    "2005 , gallazzi et al .",
    "2006 ) . while chemical properties of gas in star - forming objects have been traced up to @xmath12 by emission line studies of lyman break galaxies ( e.g. erb et al .",
    "2006 , moustakas et al .",
    "2011 ) , studies of stellar population parameters at high redshift have been proven challenging , since they require deep spectroscopy in order to trace the rest - frame continuum .",
    "recent works by gallazzi et al .",
    "2014 and choi et al .",
    "2014 push stellar population analysis to redshifts of @xmath13 , where the absorption lines commonly used for metallicity and age determinations ( balmer lines , mg , na , etc ) fall at the edge of optical spectrographs . at higher redshifts , the optical rest - frame shifts to the infrared , where observations from the ground are notoriously challenging .",
    "determinations of stellar population parameters at @xmath14 are limited to a few bright galaxies ( kriek et al 2009 , onodera eta al .",

    "we divide galaxies into quiescent and star - forming , stack their spectra in mass selected samples , and fit them with models from commonly used stellar population synthesis ( sps ) codes .",
    "the goal of the paper is two - fold . in the first place we test the accuracy of sps models at the observed redshifts and wavelengths .",
    "second , we determine constraints on the stellar ages of galaxies in mass - selected samples , at previously unexplored redshifts .",
    "we note that we apply and test the models in a relatively new regime , both in terms of redshifts and in terms of spectral resolution .",
    "most model tests have been done either at very low spectral resolution ( i.e. , broad - band and medium - band imaging , with r up to @xmath17 ) , or at moderate to high spectral resolution ( @xmath18 ) . here",
    "we apply the models to spectra with @xmath19 , intermediate between imaging and typical ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "the 3d - hst program ( van dokkum et al . 2011 ; brammer et al . 2012 ) is a 625 arcmin@xmath20 survey using hst to obtain low - resolution near - ir spectra for a complete and unbiased sample of thousands of galaxies .",
    "( cycles 18 and 19 , pi : van dokkum ) .",
    "it observes the aegis , cosmos , goods - s and uds fields with the hst / wfc3 g141 grism over 248 orbits , and it incorporates similar , publicly - available data , in the goods - n field ( go:11600 ; pi : weiner ) .",
    "these fields coincide with the area covered by candels ( grogin et al .",
    "2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) and have a wealth of publicly available imaging data ( u band to 24@xmath21 m ) .",
    "the 3d - hst photometric catalogue is described in skelton et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , and it constitutes a fundamental step in interpreting the spectra that often contain only a single emission line , if any , by providing a photometric redshift prior to the redshift fitting .",
    "the wfc3 grism spectra have been extracted with a custom pipeline , described in momcheva et al .",
    "redshifts have been measured via the combined photometric and spectroscopic information using a modified version of the eazy code ( brammer et al .",
    "the precision of redshifts is shown to be @xmath22 ( brammer et al .",

    "; see kriek et al .",

    "stellar masses have been determined using the fast code by kriek et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , using bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models , and assuming exponentially declining sfhs , solar metallicity , a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , and a calzetti ( 2000 ) dust law .",
    "+        we separate quiescent galaxies from star - forming galaxies using a color - color technique , specifically rest - frame u - v versus rest - frame v - j ( hereafter : uvj diagram ) .",
    "it has been noted in the past that selecting quiescent galaxies and star - forming galaxies based on a single color is not reliable , because heavily reddened star - forming galaxies can be as red as quiescent galaxies ( among others : williams et al .",
    "adding information from a second color ( v - j ) makes it possible to empirically distinguish between galaxies that are red in u - v because of an old stellar population featuring strong balmer / d4000 breaks ( which are relatively blue in v - j ) from galaxies that are instead red in u - v because of dust ( and therefore are red in v - j too ) .",
    "the uvj diagram has been widely used in a variety of high redshift studies ( e.g. , wuyts et al .",
    "2007 ; williams et al . 2009 ; bell et al . 2012 ; gobat et al . 2013 ) , it has been shown to correspond closely to the traditional morphological classes of early - type and late - type galaxies up to at least @xmath23 ( patel et al .",
    "2012 ) and is able to select dead galaxies with low mid - infrared fluxes ( fumagalli et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "effectively , quiescent galaxies are identified with the criteria @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( as in whitaker et al .",
    "the separating lines are chosen with the main criteria being that they lie roughly between the two modes of the population seen in figure [ uvjplot ] .",
    "we select galaxies more massive than @xmath2 . in order to achieve a sample of high - quality spectra , we exclude spectra contaminated by neighboring objects for more than 10% of their total flux , with a wavelength coverage lower than 80% of the full regime of 1.1 to 1.7 @xmath27 , and with a fraction of bad pixels higher than 10% .",
    "all of these quantities are listed in the 3d - hst catalogs .",
    "the final sample contains 572 galaxies between redshift 0.5 and 2.0 .",
    "figure [ uvjplot ] shows the selection of massive galaxies , divided into star - forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies , in three redshift bins , superposed on the entire population of galaxies from 3d - hst at the same redshift .",
    "figure [ ivoplot ] ( left ) shows all the spectra in the sample in observed wavelength sorted by redshift and divided into quiescent galaxies ( top ) and star - forming galaxies ( bottom ) .",
    "spectra are stacked in 50 redshift bins with a roughly exponential spacing .",
    "we show the number of galaxies in each bin in the histograms on the right .",
    "we see emission and absorption lines being shifted in the wavelength direction , and entering and exiting the observed range at different redshifts . for instance",
    ", the h@xmath28 line enters the wavelength range of the wfc3 grism at @xmath29 and exits at @xmath30 .",
    "we notice that the subdivision into star - forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies corresponds well to a selection on the presence of emission lines . in the quiescent galaxies sample ( figure [ ivoplot ] , left )",
    "there are no obvious emission lines visible , while at different redshifts we observe deep absorption bands ( caii , mg , na , tio ) .",
    "the star - forming galaxies sample ( figure [ ivoplot ] , right ) features strong emission lines , such as the already mentioned h@xmath28 , and h@xmath31 and [ oiii ] at higher redshift .",
    "significantly , some absorption bands are detectable also in the sfg sample .",
    "this experiment proves the quality of 3d - hst grism redshifts . as a comparison ,",
    "we show in the right column of figure [ ivoplot ] the effect of lower quality redshifts on the stacking procedure , by using photometric redshifts instead of grism redshifts . even though the photometric redshifts provided in the 3d - hst photometric catalogs ( skelton et al .",
    "2014 ) reach an excellent absolute deviation from spectroscopic redshifts of just @xmath32 ( depending on the field ) , this level of precision is not good enough to clearly observe the spectral features .",
    "figure [ ivoplot ] shows that the scatter induced by the less accurate photometric redshifts blurs emission and absorption lines . as an example [ oiii ]",
    "is very difficult to track in emission line galaxies if photometric redshifts are used .",
    "this experiment demonstrates that stacking grism spectra requires the sub - percent precision in redshift achieved with the 3d - hst @xmath33 .",
    "in individual galaxies in our sample , spectral features are often too weak to be used for reliable measurements of stellar population parameters .",
    "we therefore achieve the necessary signal - to - noise ratio by stacking spectra in 3 redshift bins , and in the two populations of star - forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies , as follows .",
    "we shift the spectra to rest - frame and fit the continuum in each spectrum with a third order polynomial . in this process",
    "we mask regions around known strong emission lines .",
    "we normalize the spectra by dividing them by the best - fit polynomial .",
    "we next determine the median flux of the normalized rest - frame spectra in a grid of 20@xmath34 .",
    "errors on the stacks are evaluated via bootstrapping : we perform 100 realizations of each sample by drawing random galaxies from the original sample ( repetitions are possible ) and we perform the stacking analysis on each resampling .",
    "the uncertainty in the flux measurement of each wavelength bin is given by the dispersion of the flux values in the resampled stacks .",
    "the composite spectra are shown in figure [ stacksqg ] ( for quiescent galaxies ) and figure [ stackssfg ] ( for star - forming galaxies ) .",
    "each individual stack is made from the sum of at least 75 galaxies .",
    "as the observations cover a constant range of observed wavelength ( @xmath35 ) , we probe different rest - frame wavelength regimes at different redshifts .",
    "the strongest features are the emission lines of h@xmath28 and [ oiii](@xmath36=5007@xmath34 ) with a peak strength of 15% over the normalized continuum .",
    "the absorption lines have depths of 5% or less .",
    "the features are weak due to the limited resolution of the spectra .",
    "we compare the stacked spectra with predictions from stellar - population synthesis models ( sps hereafter ) .",
    "our goal is to test whether different sps codes can reproduce the absorption line properties of high redshift galaxies , and to infer stellar ages for these galaxies .",
    "we use models from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 , bc03 ) , conroy & gunn ( 2010 , flexible stellar population synthesis , fsps10 ) , and conroy , kurucz , cargile , & castelli ( in prep , fsps - c3k )    we use the most standard settings for each sps code .",
    "the bc03 models are based on the padova stellar evolution tracks and isochrones ( bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) ; they use the stelib empirical stellar library ( le borgne et al .",
    "2003 ) for wavelengths between @xmath37 and the basel library of theoretical spectra elsewhere .",
    "the fsps10 models are based on a more updated version of the padova stellar evolution tracks and isochrones ( marigo et al . 2008 ) ; they use the miles empirical stellar library for wavelengths between @xmath38 and the basel library of theoretical spectra library elsewhere .",
    "we have also considered a new , high resolution theoretical spectral library ( fsps - c3k , conroy , kurucz , cargile , castelli , in prep ) .",
    "this library is based on the kurucz suite stellar atmosphere and spectral synthesis routes ( atlas12 and synthe ) and the latest set of atomic and molecular line lists .",
    "the line lists include both lab and predicted lines , the latter being particularly important for accurately modeling the broadband sed shape .",

    "the dispersion of the g141 grism is @xmath40/pixel ( r @xmath41130 in the raw data ) with a raw pixel scale of 0.12 arcsec , sampled with 0.06 arsec pixels .",
    "the lack of a slit , combined with the low spectral resolution of the wfc3 grism , implies that emission and absorption `` lines '' are effectively images of the galaxy at that particular wavelength ( see nelson et al .",
    "2015 for a detailed explanation ) . in a continuum spectrum",
    ", this means that the spectral resolution is different for each galaxy , as it is determined by its size .",
    "this effect is generally referred to as `` morphological broadening '' in the slitless spectroscopy literature ( e.g. van dokkum et al .",

    "we simulate the expected morphological broadening by convolving the high - resolution model spectra with the object morphology in the @xmath42 continuum image collapsed in the spatial direction .",
    "model spectra for each galaxy in the sample are continuum - divided and stacked with the same procedure we use for observed spectra . in the fitting of models to data",
    ", we allow an additional 3rd order polynomial continuum component with free parameters .    in summary",
    ", for each sample of galaxies , we create mock 3d - hst stacks based on three stellar population models ( bc03 , fsps10 , fsps - c3k ) with solar metallicity , chabrier imf , and three different star - formation histories ( single stellar burst , constant star formation , and an exponentially declining model with @xmath43 = 1 gyr ) , with a spacing of 0.1 gyr in light - weighted age . unless specified otherwise , all ages quoted through the paper are light - weighted ages . for an ssp , this age is identical to the time elapsed since the beginning ( and end ) of star formation , as all stars have the same age . in other models",
    "this age is some time in between the time elapsed since the onset of star formation and the ages of the youngest stars ( see , e.g. , van dokkum et al . 1998 ) .",
    "our choice of performing the stacking and the fitting analysis on continuum - divided spectra is motivated by the goal of measuring ages of galaxies without being influenced by the slope of the continuum , which is degenerate in dust and age .",
    "aging stellar populations have redder broadband colors , however dust reddening and increasing metallicity have a similar effect .",
    "for instance , the difference in @xmath44 color corresponding to 1 gyr of passive aging within the bc03 models , can also be caused by 0.5 mag of dust reddening following the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) dust law , or by an increase in metallicity from log(z ) = 0.02 ( solar ) to log(z ) = 0.05 .    in this study",
    "we do not treat galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) separately .",
    "we test the influence of agns by selecting all sources falling in the irac color - color selection presented in donley et al .",
    "the irac selected agns count for less than 5@xmath45 of each sample of quiescent galaxies / star - forming galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "the conclusions of the paper do not change when these sources are removed from the stacks .",
    "we fit the stacks of quiescent galaxies with ssps from three sps models ( bc03 , fsps10 , fsps - c3k ) assuming solar metallicity , a chabrier imf , and a single - burst sfh.=1 gyr ) , finding that light - weighted ages and residuals to the best fits are compatible ( within 1@xmath46 ) to those measured from the ssp models . ]    in this section we will discuss separately the quality of the fits for different sps models , and the stellar ages determined from the best fits .      figure [ bestfitsqg05 ] shows for each of the models ( bc03 , fsps10 , fsps - c3k ) the best fits to the qg stack for the lower redshift bin ( @xmath47 ) .",

    "moreover , the reduced @xmath48 ( @xmath39 ) of the best fit is high ( 11.46 ) . using fsps10 ( green ) , the best fit also has significant ( @xmath49 ) residuals at the reddest wavelengths ( @xmath50 ) and around the @xmath51 regime , where the first tio band lies .",
    "the @xmath39 value of the best fit is still high ( 8.5 ) .",
    "finally , using the latest fsps - c3k models ( figure [ bestfitsqg05 ] , bottom left ) the best fit converges with a lower @xmath52 , and residuals are below @xmath53 consistently over the entire wavelength range .",
    "we compare residuals from different sps models ( data - model ) in the bottom panel of figure [ bestfitsqg05 ] .",
    "all best - fits have positive residuals in the @xmath54 region ( up to @xmath55 for fsps10 ) , underestimating the fluxes at those wavelengths . at wavelengths",
    "higher than 8000@xmath34 the bc03 models have positive residuals , while fsps10/fsps - c3k have negative ones .    moving to higher redshifts ,",
    "the quality of fits with different sps models is comparable . in the intermediate ( @xmath56 , figure [ bestfitsqg10 ] ) and in the high redshift bin ( @xmath57 , figure [ bestfitsqg15 ] ) we examine ,",
    "all @xmath39 range from 2.8 to 3.3 .",
    "residuals in these redshift bins are comparable among different models , and tend to be smaller than a few percent .",
    "we evaluate residuals corresponding to the h@xmath28 line in quiescent galaxies in section [ halpha in quiescent galaxies ] .",
    "the stellar ages of quiescent galaxies implied by the best - fit models vary according to the used ssp . in order to evaluate the uncertainty of the age measurement we bootstrap the sample 100 times and repeat the fitting analysis on the bootstrapped realizations of the stack .    at the lowest redshift bin ( @xmath47 , figure [ bestfitsqg05 ] ) we obtain a stellar age of 3.8 @xmath58 gyr with bc03 , a younger age ( 2.4 @xmath59 gyr ) with fsps10 and again 4.0 @xmath60 gyr with fsps - c3k ( which is the model with the lowest residuals ) .",

    "we moreover remark that , as seen in section 4.1 , none of the models that we explore properly fit the data at rest - frame wavelengths redder than  7500@xmath34 : at those wavelengths lines such as tio and caii could help in constraining metallicities ( e.g. carrera et al .",

    "in order to investigate the origin of the qualitative difference in the best fits described in section [ quiescent galaxies ] , we compare model spectra from different sps codes .",
    "we show model ssps from the bc03 , fsps10 and fsps - c3k codes in figure [ different_models ] , for different ages .",
    "the strengths of the absorption lines vary among models , for every age .",
    "we notice in particular that at wavelengths higher than @xmath80 different models predict different absorption bands at different wavelengths .",
    "we quantify the spread in the models at different wavelengths by computing the mean difference between every possible combination of models at the same age ( figure [ different_models ] , bottom ) . this value is lower than 1% at wavelength between @xmath81 and @xmath4 , and is larger otherwise .",
    "in particular the region with wavelengths greater than @xmath82 has a large discrepancy between bc03 on one side , and fsps10 and fsps - c3k on the other .",
    "this explains why determinations of ages from 3d - hst at higher redshifts are more stable between different models than those at lower redshift . for our lowest redshift sample ( @xmath83 ) we observe the region of the spectrum where discrepancies among models are the largest , while at high redshift we observe rest - frame wavelengths where models are more similar to each others .",
    "we investigate the evolution of ages of quiescent galaxies in a mass limited sample . in fig .",
    "[ evolutionages ] ( left ) we show the ages obtained by fitting 3d - hst stacks with different stellar population synthesis models . even though the model dependent spread in ages is large , we observe that quiescent galaxies are younger at higher redshift and that , at each redshift , quiescent galaxies are not maximally old ; instead their age is smaller than half of the age of the universe at the same redshift .",
    "we compare to data in a similar mass range by gallazzi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) at @xmath84 and by whitaker et al .",
    "( 2013 , who also uses spectra from 3d - hst ) at @xmath65 , obtaining good agreement . also , at lower redshifts , choi et al .",

    "the age value from the highest redshift mapped by choi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) is lower than the fsps - c3k determination from this work , but similar to the determination obtained with the fsps10 code , used by choi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) as well .",
    "we also note that the selection criteria and the rest - frame wavelength regime in choi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) are different from those in the present study .",
    "we test if the discrepancy between choi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and our study can be caused by a selection bias , by repeating the spectral stacking and the fitting with the same ssfr selection of choi et al .",
    "we find an age of 1.8 @xmath86 0.6 gyr , younger than our previous determination , in accordance to choi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "fairly young ages of quiescent galaxies are expected at @xmath23 from the mass build - up of galaxies : a subset of the quiescent galaxies were likely still star forming at slightly higher redshifts .",
    "in addition , quiescent galaxies may grow by merging with lower mass star - forming galaxies .",
    "the processes involved are clearly complex but a simple estimate of the expected ages of z@xmath111 quiescent galaxies can be obtained from comparisons of comoving stellar mass densities of quiescent galaxies and star - forming galaxies .",
    "muzzin et al . (",
    "2014 ) find a stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies at @xmath23 of log(@xmath87 @xmath88 ) = 7.8 $ ] ( their fig .",
    "this density was reached at a redshift of @xmath89 for all galaxies ( that is , quiescent and star - forming galaxies ) .",
    "if the oldest stars at @xmath90 are in the quiescent galaxiy population , these stars finished forming at a redshift of @xmath89 .",
    "the time difference between @xmath91 and @xmath92 is 2.6 gyr .",
    "this is then the youngest age of this population , while the median age is defined by the redshift at which half of the mass was formed ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the resulting median age is 3 gyr , similar to that we observe in this study ( fig .",
    "[ evolutionages ] , right ) .",
    "this is strictly an upper limit to the age since z=1 quiescent galaxies can contain stars that formed later . on the other hand",
    "this argument is strictly valid for the full population of quiescent galaxies , and lower mass quiescent galaxies might be somewhat younger .",
    "it is remarkable that this simple argument gives an age which agrees well with our general results .",
    "ages of galaxies can also be inferred from photometry only . in 3d - hst",
    "stellar masses , star - formation rates , ages and dust extinction are estimated with the fast code ( kriek et al .",
    "2009 ) , assuming exponentially declining star formation histories with a minimum e - folding time of @xmath94 , a minimum age of 40 myr , @xmath95 mag and the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) dust attenuation law ( see skelton et al .",
    "the output from the fast code is an age defined as the time since the onset of sf , that is not necessary equivalent to a light - weighted age .    for each galaxy",
    "we therefore compute a light - weighted age ( @xmath96 ) following the definition :    @xmath97 where :    * @xmath73 is the time of observation ( equivalent to the age of fast ) * @xmath98 is the star formation rate at time @xmath99 . in the case of the fast fits",
    "@xmath98 has the functional shape of a @xmath43 model @xmath100 * @xmath101 is the v - band flux of 1 @xmath102 element formed at @xmath99 and observed at time @xmath73 .",
    "* @xmath103 is the time - step we divide the sfh in ( we use @xmath104 myr ) .",
    "we notice that for an ssp @xmath105 .",
    "figure [ lwamodels ] shows the relation between the time from the onset of star - formation @xmath73 and @xmath96 for a range of models : an ssp , a csf model , and an exponentially declining model with @xmath72 .",
    "as expected,@xmath96 for an ssp ( red line ) is well approximated by @xmath73 . for a csf ( blue line ) @xmath96 is always smaller than @xmath73 , with a increasing difference at later times .",
    "this effect is naturally explained by the fact that younger stars are brighter than older stars : @xmath106 peaks at 10 myr , and declines afterwards ( in other words the mass - to - light ratio @xmath107 increases for older stellar populations , see among others bruzual & charlot 2003 , fig 1 to 5 ) . the @xmath43 model ( purple line )",
    "has an intermediate behavior , being similar to the csf for @xmath108 , and parallel to the ssp for large @xmath73 .",
    "we note that these relations are well known ( see , e.g. , appendix a of van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "for each quiescent galaxy in the sample , we infer @xmath96 from the best fit to its photometry , and find the average value in the three redshift bins @xmath47 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ evolutionages ] ( left ) shows how the quantity compares to the ages measured from the spectra ( section [ quiescent galaxies ] ) with different sets of models . for each redshift bin ages derived from photometry",
    "tend to be comparable to the lowest values obtained with the spectral fitting .",
    "another technique commonly used to constrain ages of high redshift quiescent galaxies is provided by the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 , hereafter : fp ) . in particular , the fp is a model - independent tool for measuring the mass to light ratio ( m / l ) .",
    "the offset between the m / l of high redshift galaxies and that of local galaxies can therefore be used to estimate the age of their stellar populations ( franx 1993 , van dokkum & franx 1996 , van der wel et al .",
    "2004 , treu et al .",
    "since the luminosity of an ssp evolves with time as @xmath109 , ( with the parameter k derived from stellar population models ) , the relation between the evolution of m / l and light - weighted ages can therefore be approximated as @xmath110 .",
    "measurements of the evolution of @xmath111 up to @xmath112 agree with values @xmath113 ( van dokkum & stanford 2003 , wuyts et al .",
    "2004 , holden et al .",
    "2005 ) . given a value of k=-0.98 ( from bc03 models in the b band , with a chabrier imf ) , we derive the following relation between the local light - weighted ages and those at high redshift : @xmath114 .",
    "the observed evolution of the @xmath111 predicts that the ages of quiescent galaxies at @xmath23 are 2.8 times younger than those at @xmath68 , and 4 times younger at @xmath115 .",
    "figure [ evolutionages ] shows the age evolution predicted from m / l measurements .",
    "we use 8 gyr as the age of galaxies at @xmath68 , as measured from sdss spectra by gallazzi et al .",
    "the agreement between the fp prediction and measurements from 3d - hst spectra is excellent .",
    "only the spectral measurement with the bc03 models at @xmath116 and the one with the fsps10 models at @xmath117 significantly deviate from the fp prediction .           at redshifts",
    "lower than 1.5 we can quantify the h@xmath28 emission and [ nii ] are inevitably blended , therefore we will refer to measurements of h@xmath28+[nii ] ] in quiescent galaxies from the residuals to the best fits ( figure [ bestfitsqg05 ] and [ bestfitsqg10 ] ) .",
    "we subtract the best - fit model with the fsps - c3k sps from the stacks , and fit residuals with a gaussian centered at the h@xmath28 wavelength ( @xmath1186563@xmath34 ) .",
    "since the stacks are continuum subtracted , this is effectively a direct measurement of ew(h@xmath28+[nii ] ) . at the lowest redshifts ( @xmath47 ) , we do not obtain a significant detection , with @xmath119)=0.5 \\pm 0.3 \\aa$ ] , while at @xmath56 we robustly detect the emission line , measuring ew(h@xmath28+[nii ] ) = @xmath120 . in the same mass / redshift regime",
    "typical star - forming galaxies have ew(h@xmath28+[nii ] ) @xmath121 ( fumagalli et al .",
    "this shows that , assuming no dust absorption , the h@xmath28 emission in quiescent galaxies is quenched by a factor of @xmath122 .    to estimate the h@xmath28 fluxes , we multiply the ew(h@xmath28+[nii ] ) by the median continuum flux of galaxies in the stack , and assume a 0.25 ratio for [ nii]/(h@xmath28+[nii ] ) .",
    "we finally estimate sfr(h@xmath28 ) with the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation , obtaining that quiescent galaxies have @xmath123 at @xmath56 and @xmath124 at @xmath47 , assuming no dust absorption .    in fumagalli",

    "we obtain sfr(h@xmath28)@xmath129 , which would require a significant dust extinction for the h@xmath28 line ( @xmath130 2.6 ) to be reconciled with the sfr(ir ) measurement .",

    "sfrs measured from h@xmath28 are instead contaminated by potential agn or liner emission and affected by dust extinction .",
    "our combined multiwavelength findings agree however in indicating that sfrs of quiescent galaxies are very low , they are negligible in comparison to those of star - forming galaxies at the same redshift , and they are potentially consistent with 0 .",
