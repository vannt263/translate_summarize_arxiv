    "the study of black holes in stationary and asymptotically flat spacetimes has led to many remarkable insights , such as the `` no hair '' theorem and the discovery of the thermodynamic properties of black holes .",
    "in contrast , black holes in a friedmann background have not been fully investigated and many important open questions remain . when the size of the black hole is much smaller than the cosmological horizon",
    ", asymptotically flat black hole solutions will presumably provide a good approximation .",
    "however , for black holes comparable to the horizon size  such as primordial black holes ( pbhs ) formed in the early universe  @xcite  one would need to take into account the effects of the cosmological expansion .",
    "the main issue addressed in this paper is the growth of such `` cosmological '' black holes . zeldovich and novikov  @xcite first discussed the possibility of self - similar growth for a black hole in a friedmann universe in 1967 .",
    "this suggested that the size of a pbh might always be the same fraction of the size of the particle horizon until the end of the radiation - dominated era , when they would have a mass of order @xmath2 .",
    "since there is no evidence that such huge black holes exist , this seemed to imply that pbhs never formed at all .",
    "more recently , the possibility of self - similar pbh growth in the quintessence scenario has led to the suggestion that pbhs could provide seeds for the supermassive black holes thought to reside in galactic nuclei  @xcite . however , both these arguments are based on a simple newtonian analysis .",
    "the first general relativistic analyses of self - similar cosmological black holes was given by carr and hawking  @xcite for a radiation fluid in 1974 .",
    "they showed that there is no self - similar solution which contains a black hole attached to an exact friedmann background via a sonic point ( i.e. in which the black hole forms by purely causal processes ) .",
    "this result was extended to the perfect fluid case with @xmath3 and @xmath4 by carr  @xcite and bicknell and henriksen  @xcite . for a stiff fluid ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "it was originally claimed by lin et al .",
    "@xcite that self - similar cosmological black holes _ could _ exist .",
    "however , bicknell and henriksen  @xcite subsequently showed that this solution does not represent a black hole after all , since lin et al .",
    "had misidentified the event horizon .",
    "although bicknell and henriksen did construct some numerical self - similar solutions , in these the stiff fluid turns into null dust at a timelike hypersurface , which seems physically implausible .",
    "indeed , we have recently proved rigorously the non - existence of self - similar cosmological black holes for both a stiff fluid and a scalar field  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on fluids with @xmath1 .",
    "although this equation of state violates the strong energy conditions , it may still be very relevant for cosmology  both in the early universe ( when inflation occurred  @xcite ) and at the current epoch ( when the acceleration may be driven by some form of dark energy  @xcite ) .",
    "such matter exhibits `` anti - gravity ''  in the sense that the active gravitational mass in the raychaudhuri equation is negative  but the dominant , null and weak energy conditions still hold .",
    "recently , the accretion of dark energy or a phantom field onto a black hole has also been studied  @xcite , but the cosmological expansion is again neglected in these analyses .",
    "the @xmath1 case is particularly important in the cosmological context because there then exists a one - parameter family of self - similar solutions which are exactly asymptotic to the flat friedmann model at large distances  @xcite . in the positive pressure case",
    ", the solutions can not be `` properly '' asymptotic friedmann because they exhibit a solid angle deficit at infinity , so it would be more accurate to describe them by `` quasi - friedmann ''  @xcite . in the present paper , we obtain a one - parameter family of physically reasonable self - similar cosmological black hole solutions numerically .",
    "this strongly suggests that a black hole in a universe filled with dark energy _ can _ grow in a self - similar manner . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this system was also numerically investigated but no black hole solution was reported .",
    "this is because one needs to consider the analytic extension of the solutions to find the black holes and this was not done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also find that there exists a class of self - similar cosmological wormhole solutions .",
    "a wormhole is an object connecting two ( or more ) infinities .",
    "einstein s equations certainly permit such solutions .",
    "for example , the well - known _ static _ wormhole studied by morris and thorne  @xcite connects two asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "although the concept of a wormhole is originally topological and global , it is possible to define it locally by a two - dimensional surface of minimal area on a non - timelike hypersurface .",
    "however , in any local definition , we inevitably face the problem of time - slicing , because the concept of `` minimal area '' is slice - dependent .",
    "hochberg and visser  @xcite and hayward  @xcite define a wormhole throat on a null hypersurface , in which case , a light ray can travel from one infinity to another infinity .",
    "their definition excludes the maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime from the family of wormhole spacetimes .",
    "it also implies that in the non - static situation the null energy condition ( @xmath6 for the present matter model ) must be violated at the wormhole throat , so the existence of wormholes might seem implausible  @xcite .",
    "however , their definition of a wormhole is physically reasonable only in the presence of a past null infinity , and in the cosmological situation this often does not apply because there is a big - bang singularity .",
    "thus , wormholes in their sense may be too restrictive in the cosmological context .",
    "this motivates us to define a wormhole throat on a _ spacelike _ hypersurface .",
    "here we adopt the conventional definition of traversability in which an observer can go from one infinity to another distinct infinity .",
    "our numerical solutions are not wormholes in the sense of hochberg and visser  @xcite or hayward  @xcite but they are wormholes in the sense that they connect two infinities .",
    "also , although dark energy violates the strong energy condition , the null energy condition is still satisfied in our wormhole solutions .",
    "numerical solutions containing a super - horizon - size black hole in a friedmann universe filled with a massless scalar field provide another interesting example of this sort of wormhole  @xcite .",
    "these involve a wormhole structure with two distinct null infinities , where all possible energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "we find that there are three types of cosmological self - similar wormhole solutions .",
    "the first connects two friedmann universes , the second a friedmann and quasi - friedmann universe , the third a friedmann universe and a quasi - static spacelike infinity .",
    "in fact , solutions of the third type are naturally interpreted as a friedmann universe emergent from a white hole . in order to obtain these results",
    ", we utilize the formulation and asymptotic analyses presented in the accompanying paper  @xcite ( henceforth paper i ) .",
    "the combination of these two papers completes the classification of asymptotically friedmann spherically symmetric self - similar solutions with dark energy .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] , we present the basic variables and describe the numerical results .",
    "( paper i provides the detailed formulation and field equations . ) in section  [ sec : physical_interpretation ] , we classify the self - similar solutions in terms of their physical properties .",
    "section  [ sec : summary_discussion ] provides a summary and discussion .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric self - similar spacetime with a perfect fluid and adopt comoving coordinates .",
    "the line element can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the self - similar variable , @xmath9 is the areal radius , and we adopt units with @xmath10 .",
    "the einstein equations imply that the pressure @xmath11 , energy density @xmath12 and the misner - sharp mass @xmath13 must have the form @xmath14 we assume an equation of state @xmath3 with @xmath1 . a crucial role is played by the velocity function @xmath15 , which is the velocity of the fluid relative to the similarity surface of constant @xmath16 .",
    "a similarity surface is spacelike for @xmath17 , timelike for @xmath18 , and null for @xmath19 . in the last case , the surface",
    "is called a `` similarity horizon '' .",
    "we also use trapping horizon notation for describing the physical properties of solutions .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the definition of a trapping horizon . )",
    "the basic field equations are derived from the einstein equations .",
    "because of the self - similarity , they reduce to a set of three ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , together with a constraint equation .",
    "( this is discussed in paper i and also ref .",
    "another formulation of the field equations , involving a set of three odes for @xmath23 , @xmath20 and @xmath22 together with a constraint equation , is given in ref .",

    "we assume @xmath30 as a typical example and numerically integrate the odes using the constraint equation ( i.2.31 ) or ( i.2.32 ) to monitor the numerical accuracy .",
    "as shown in paper i , some of the solutions admit an extension beyond @xmath31 ( which corresponds to a finite non - zero physical distance ) . to assure this , we choose suitable dependent variables and then expand these as taylor series with respect to a new independent variable around @xmath32 .",
    "paper i specifies the variables which satisfy this requirement for asymptotically quasi - kantowski - sachs and quasi - static solutions .",
    "this is our key technique for obtaining the extension of the solution while retaining good numerical accuracy . in order to display the solutions ,",
    "we plot @xmath33 on the horizontal axis .",

    "it is sometimes assumed that wormholes require negative energy density and there are certainly theorems to this effect  @xcite .",
    "our solutions do not require negative energy density but this does not conflict with these theorems because we have a different definition of a wormhole throat .    the theorems claiming the violation of the null energy condition at a wormhole throat  @xcite define the throat on a null hypersurface . in this case , the throat coincides with a trapping horizon . in the present paper",
    "we define a wormhole throat on a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "in fact , our wormhole solutions do not have a trapping horizon at all , so they are not wormholes in the sense of hochberg and visser  @xcite or hayward  @xcite even though they possess two distinct infinities .",
    "we discuss this problem in a more general framework in a separate paper  @xcite .    here",
    "we also consider the threshold between the friedmann - quasi - friedmann solutions and the cosmological white hole solutions .",

    "we have integrated the field equations for the self - similar solutions and interpreted the solutions using the asymptotic analysis of paper i. the results are summarized in table i.    we have seen that there is a class of asymptotically friedmann self - similar black hole solutions and this contrasts to the situation with positive pressure fluids or scalar fields , where there are no such solutions .",
    "this suggests that self - similar growth of pbhs is possible in an inflationary flat friedmann universe with dark energy , which may support the claim in ref .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the pressure gradient of dark energy is in the opposite direction to the density gradient .",
    "it therefore gives an attractive force which pulls the matter inwards , whereas the gravitational force is repulsive .",
    "so if the black hole is small and the density gradient steep , it can accrete the surrounding mass effectively .    for @xmath30",
    ", we have found numerically that the ratio of the size of the black hole event horizon to the hubble length is between @xmath116 and @xmath158 .",
    "this means that the size of such a self - similar cosmological black hole has an upper limit but it can be arbitrarily small , so black holes which grow as fast as the universe can not be too large .",
    "it should be stressed that there is a one - parameter family of self - similar cosmological black hole solutions , so we do not have to fine - tune the mass of the black hole to get self - similar growth .",
    "this means that self - similar black hole growth is very plausible in a universe with dark energy of this kind .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual newtonian argument for a positive pressure fluid  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the black hole solutions , we have found self - similar solutions which represent a friedmann universe connected to either another friedmann universe or some other cosmological model .",
    "they are interpreted as self - similar cosmological white hole or wormhole solutions .",
    "these are classified into three types , according to whether the other infinity is friedmann , quasi - friedmann , or quasi - static , among which the last type is interpreted as a white hole in a friedmann background .",
    "these solutions provide intriguing examples of dynamical wormholes .",
    "since they are cosmological solutions , they are not asymptotically flat and they do not have a regular past null infinity .",
    "rather they are asymptotic to models which are expanding at spacelike infinity and have an initial singularity .    in such situations a wormhole throat",
    "should be locally defined as a two - sphere of minimal area on the spacelike hypersurfaces rather than a trapping horizon . according to the conventional definition of traversability",
    ", none of our numerical solutions represents a traversable wormhole because of the absence of a past null infinity .",
    "the strong energy condition is violated there but the null , dominant and weak energy conditions are still all satisfied .",
    "our wormhole solutions do not have a trapping horizon : because there is no violation of the null energy condition , they are not dynamical wormholes in the sense of hochberg and visser  @xcite or hayward  @xcite .    finally , we note that the homothetic ( rather than comoving ) approach is another powerful method of studying self - similar solutions . in the positive pressure case ,",
    "the homothetic and comoving approaches are complementary , which leads to a comprehensive understanding of self - similar solutions  @xcite .",
