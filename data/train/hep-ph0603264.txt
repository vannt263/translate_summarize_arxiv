    "observations of solar , atmospheric , reactor and long - baseline neutrinos have provided compelling evidence for neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the latest analysis of the data from the super - kamiokande ( super - k ) collaboration @xcite presents a clear and unambiguous evidence for the oscillation hypothesis @xcite by establishing the first _",
    "oscillation minimum _ and hence for non - zero ( and different ) neutrino masses and mixing . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite has provided incontrovertible evidence for neutrino oscillation from solar neutrino data .",
    "clearly neutrino physics is now entering an era of precision measurements .",
    "the focus from now on will be to precisely determine the oscillation parameters apart from the observation of the oscillation pattern beyond the first minimum . given the reach of present and proposed experiments , the goal is to understand in detail the sensitivity of the oscillation probabilities to fundamental neutrino parameters , which are the mass - squared differences and mixing angles and phases .",
    "it is therefore crucial to choose processes or observables that maximise the sensitivity to the parameter(s ) of interest .",
    "it turns out that the density profile of matter that the neutrinos pass through before detection naturally accentuates the sensitivity to the mixing angles @xmath2 , @xmath0 and the mass squared difference @xmath1 . these _",
    "matter effects _ have been studied before , with atmospheric neutrinos , in various contexts , in refs .",
    "in particular , substantial matter dependences occur in the energy range of interest only if @xmath5 is different from zero ; a non - zero value of this parameter also opens the window to cp violation in the lepton sector . since only an upper bound exists on this parameter so far ,",
    "the variation in sensitivity to other parameters can be large or small , depending on the true value of @xmath2 .",
    "this paper is devoted to the detailed study of oscillation probabilities of energetic ( gev energy ) neutrinos and anti - neutrinos propagating through the earth in a three flavour framework using accurate numerical methods .",
    "the paper is divided into two parts : the first part is devoted to the broad theme of sensitivity of the neutrino ( and anti - neutrino ) oscillation probabilities to the fundamental neutrino parameters in the gev region .",
    "the results of this analysis are equally applicable to atmospheric neutrinos as well as to neutrino beams from future neutrino factories .",
    "while some of this information is already known , we emphasise a few surprising variations .    having determined the various sensitivities , we then use the results of the first part to maximise matter effects in a study of atmospheric neutrinos ( and anti - neutrinos ) using detectors having charge identification capability and study how best these parameters can be constrained / determined by such an analysis .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we outline the framework for the calculation of neutrino probabilities . though numerical procedures have been developed to calculate any desired survival or conversion probability , in this paper we focus on the probabilities relevant for the accurate calculation of muon - neutrino ( and anti - neutrino ) events at a detector .",
    "we also list here the current limits on the oscillation parameters .    in section 3 ,",
    "we consider , in turn , the variation of the muon neutrino survival and conversion probabilities as the oscillation parameters are varied within the allowed limits .",
    "the compendium of results listed here applies generically to any combination of neutrino source and detector where gev energy neutrinos traverse the earth .    in section 4 ,",
    "we present results for event rates calculated with atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we also identify in passing interesting regions in energy  nadir angle space for long - baseline neutrinos .",
    "the results are calculated for up / down ratios of event rates binned as a function of the zenith angle or equivalently distance @xmath6 to bring out the maximal sensitivity to parameters , especially @xmath2 , @xmath0 and the sign of @xmath1 .",
    "the question of hierarchy from the sign of @xmath1 has been discussed in detail before @xcite ; we focus here on the sensitivity of event rates and event ratios to the magnitude of this parameter .",
    "an important open question is the deviation from maximal of the mixing angle @xmath0 , that is , its octant sensitivity .",
    "this was analysed recently by choubey and roy @xcite ; we present results here which are complementary to their analysis .",
    "the issue of both the mass hierarchy and the octant of @xmath0 have relevance to the structure of neutrino mass models .",
    "in section 5 we present a summary of our results and conclusions ; we also highlight the improvement over the earlier results .",
    "some remarks on the numerical computation are presented in the appendix .",
    "we also discuss the possible points of departure from earlier calculations , especially those that have been used in neutrino event generators such as nuance @xcite .",

    "there is also a dependence on the density profile of the earth .",
    "we shall discuss these dependences one by one .",

    "notice that the smooth oscillations seen in the lower panels are modified due to matter effects ( turned on when @xmath76 ) in the upper panel .",
    "in general , the modification is significant in the small nadir angle bins for lower energies ( @xmath77 gev ) , and at all nadir angle bins in the intermediate energy region ( represented by the central panel at @xmath67 gev ) when resonance occurs in the mantle .",
    "the interplay between the variation in @xmath48 ( even at the 2@xmath51 level ) and that in the relatively unknown @xmath2 is clear from the @xmath67 gev panels : the same muon survival probability for upward - going neutrinos ( @xmath78 ) can come from ( @xmath79 ) both large : ( @xmath80 ev@xmath81 ) or both small : ( @xmath82 ev@xmath73 , @xmath83 ) .",
    "since matter effects are relatively unimportant for anti - neutrinos ( in the normal hierarchy ) the anti - neutrino survival probability at all allowed @xmath2 is close to the neutrino survival probability at @xmath84 .",

    ", it will be important for long baseline neutrinos since one can separately study @xmath36 through _ wrong sign muons_. the anti - neutrino conversion probability , however , remains small even for large @xmath2 and is therefore not shown .",
    "the super - kamiokande data favour a best - fit value of @xmath93 in a 2-flavour analysis .",
    "although a recent 3-flavour global analysis @xcite indicates that this parameter may be slightly smaller , @xmath94 , the 2@xmath51 allowed parameter space spans both octants : @xmath95 .",
    "the dominant ( matter - independent ) term in the survival probability depends on @xmath96 .",
    "it is therefore difficult to substantially decrease errors on @xmath0 via a measurement of the leading contribution .",
    "furthermore , even if a deviation from the maximal value is measured , it is impossible to determine the octant with such a term .",
    "methods to determine the octant of @xmath0 have been discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "sensitivity to the octant of this angle is realised through sub - leading terms that depend on @xmath0 , not @xmath97 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ eq : p3num ] .",
    "these are matter - dependent and sub - leading because they are also proportional to @xmath59 , which is known to be small but is otherwise unknown .",
    "[ fig:23 t ] shows the sensitivity of @xmath35 to variations in @xmath0 . for clarity of discussion",
    ", we choose a central value of @xmath98 ( that is , choose a maximal value rather than the slightly smaller central best - fit value as used earlier ) and the _ same _ 2@xmath51 variation about it .",
    "when @xmath75 , symmetric 2@xmath51 variations about the central value of @xmath98 lead to the _ same _ survival probability , as can be seen at all neutrino energies in the lower panels of the figure .",
    "when @xmath2 is not zero , the survival probability for @xmath0 less than maximal ( red dotted line ) lies consistently above the central value ( solid line ) for all values of @xmath48 , @xmath99 and nadir angles .",
    "this happens because the terms in @xmath35 involving @xmath100 and @xmath101 come with the same relative ( negative ) sign , as seen from eq .",
    "[ eq : p3num ] . as @xmath0 increases from the first octant towards",
    "maximal , both these terms are increasing so that the probability systematically decreases .",
    "however , as @xmath0 increases from the maximal to a value in the second octant , @xmath102 increases while @xmath101 _ decreases _ , leading to a complicated dependence of the probability on this parameter .",
    "hence no such regular behaviour is seen when @xmath0 is larger than @xmath98 although , in a large portion of phase space at @xmath6710 gev , the probability for @xmath103 @xmath98 is systematically larger ( smaller ) than that at @xmath104 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig:23 t ] that , for non - zero @xmath2 , the probability curve for @xmath0 in the first octant ( @xmath105 ) is better separated from that for @xmath106 , than the curve for @xmath0 in the second octant ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "evidently , the ability to determine whether @xmath0 is different from maximal will depend on which octant the true value of @xmath0 lies in .",
    "this is also reflected in our numerical results with atmospheric neutrino events , as discussed in the next section .",
    "precisely the opposite effect is seen in the conversion probability @xmath36 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : e23 t ] . here , the probability increases with @xmath0 for all @xmath48 values at all energies and nadir angles so that the probability for @xmath103 @xmath98 is _ systematically larger ( smaller ) than the probability with @xmath108 .",
    "_ this can be easily seen from the fact that there is a single term proportional to @xmath100 in eq .",
    "[ eq : p3num ] for @xmath36 , appearing with the opposite sign to the matter terms in @xmath35 .",
    "hence a long base - line experiment , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 beams are separately available , will be able to clearly establish the octant of @xmath0 by studying the @xmath36 conversion probability via the wrong - sign muon events .    note that if @xmath84 exactly , then the octant determination can not be made from @xmath35 although @xmath36 still shows the same dependence on @xmath0 as discussed above .",
    "however , @xmath36 is insignificant in this energy range and hence octant discrimination at @xmath75 is possible only through a study of @xmath36 at low energies around @xmath111 gev , when resonance effects in the ( 12 ) sector enhance this probability .",
    "this is outside the scope of the present paper and will be discussed in a separate publication .",
    "this relatively systematic dependence on @xmath0 is in contrast to the rather complex dependence of the survival and conversion probabilities on @xmath48 and @xmath2 .",
    "both these probabilities contribute to the observed muon events in studies of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we shall explore this further in a later section to maximise this `` octant - seeking '' effect .",
    "in contrast , the matter dependence is small for the anti - neutrinos ; hence , the anti - neutrino survival probabilities for all @xmath2 values are similar to the neutrino survival probability at @xmath112 and do not distinguish the octant of @xmath0 .",
    "we reiterate that this is a consequence of the chosen hierarchy ; opposite results are obtained with the inverted hierarchy ( matter effects are ultimately larger in the normal hierarchy since the anti - neutrino cross - sections are smaller than the neutrino cross - sections so that event rates are larger and matter effects better differentiated in the neutrino sector ) .      in order to compute the effect of earth s matter on the probabilities , we have used the prem model @xcite which gives the density profile of a `` spherical equivalent earth ''",
    ". while the locations of the discontinuities and mantle - core transitions are rather well - known , the absolute values of the densities themselves are not so well established .",
    "hence , in order to study effects of uncertainties in the earth s density , we have retained the locations of the discontinuities while changing the density values .",
    "we have done this in a simple manner by changing all the densities within the core by @xmath113 = 0.6 gm / cc ( a change of roughly 5% , as allowed by the model ) , and suitably adjusting the mantle densities in such a way as to maintain the overall mass of the earth to be constant .",
    "such a procedure results in a much smaller change in the mantle densities of @xmath114 , in the opposite direction .",
    "the consequences of such a density change to the neutrino survival and conversion probabilities are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : det ] and [ fig : edet ] respectively . here",
    "@xmath115 and @xmath116 correspond to increasing and decreasing the core densities by 5% , with the mantle densities adjusted suitably .",
    "the solid black line is for the original prem density profile .",
    "again , the size of matter effects depends on @xmath48 ; changing the density alters the @xmath48 at which resonance occurs , for a given neutrino energy .",
    "a point to note is the difference between the prem profile and constant density slabs .",
    "the former has a continuously changing density profile , even within slabs .",
    "hence neutrinos with a band of energy can undergo resonance in any given slab .",
    "in contrast , only a neutrino with a single definite energy can undergo resonance in a constant density slab ( apart from having purely adiabatic propagation inside any slab ) . due to this , the probability curve as a function of zenith angle for a given energy can look very different when computed with the prem profile and with a constant density approximation , even when the latter closely follows the prem profile .",
    "however , when an integration over an energy bin is performed , such variations get averaged out . more details on this issue",
    "are given in the appendix .    at low energies where the matter effects are significant only for core - crossing neutrinos at small nadir angles , the effects of altering the density profile",
    "are also seen only at these small nadir angles , as can be seen from the upper panels of the figures . at higher energies ,",
    "changes appear at larger nadir angles as well , as can be seen from the lower panels , since resonance ( and enhanced matter effects ) occurs in the mantle itself .",
    "while the variations are small , except at small nadir angles , again , they are complex and depend on both energy and a precise knowledge of @xmath48 . probing the earth density , especially in the core , with neutrino oscillation physics using neutrino factory beams has been discussed earlier @xcite . here , only the dependence on @xmath2 was considered while @xmath48 was kept fixed .",
    "we remark that in all cases there is also a dependence on @xmath2 at small nadir angles since the variations with @xmath2 are substantial here , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:13 t ] .",
    "the dependence on density variations may be disentangled from that on @xmath2 since substantial variations in the intermediate nadir angle region can only be due to @xmath2 , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:13 t ] .",
    "the anti - neutrino probabilities again do not show any significant dependence on these parameters in the normal hierarchy .",
    "we now explore the dependence of the probabilities on the cp phase @xmath16 .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpt ] , again for @xmath74 .",
    "apart from the dashed vertical line at @xmath117 that separates the `` up - going '' probability from the `` down - going '' one , the dotted vertical line at @xmath118 indicates the nadir angle corresponding to the so - called `` magic base - line '' @xcite where the probabilities are independent of the cp phase .",
    "since the earth mantle density is not a constant , this is actually a band around that nadir angle , as can be seen from the figure .",
    "the effect of the cp phase @xmath16 competes with the matter effect which in turn depends on the relative size of the matter term @xmath30 compared to @xmath48 .",
    "the variation of the probabilities ( as a function of energy and nadir angle ) with @xmath16 for the current 2@xmath51 allowed range of @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpt ] .",
    "this variation is so small that it is unlikely to be measured via a study of atmospheric neutrinos and may need long base - line measurements where the spectrum and nadir angle are well - known .",
    "nevertheless , we make a few remarks on the general behaviour .    while the survival probability @xmath35 is symmetric for @xmath119 , @xmath36 can distinguish the cases @xmath120 . at low energy , @xmath77 gev , the top panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpt ] indicate that the survival probability @xmath35 is typically larger for @xmath121 at all nadir angles , smaller for @xmath122 and smallest for @xmath123 , _ independent _ of @xmath48 .",

    "the fluxes of atmospheric neutrinos from directions @xmath55 and @xmath149 are expected to be similar in the absence of oscillations , especially for larger energies ( @xmath99 greater than a few gev ) .",

    ", this ratio also minimises errors due to the uncertainties in the overall flux normalisation ( which can be as large as 30% ) and those in the cross - sections ( about 10% ) .",
    "we now proceed to determine these ratios numerically , and study their sensitivity to the oscillation parameters of interest .",
    "we use the 3d atmospheric neutrino fluxes as calculated by honda et al .",

    "the charged current muon - neutrino nucleus cross - sections used have also been extracted from the nuance code . at the low end of the energy spectrum ,",
    "the interaction with the detector material is mainly through quasi - elastic and resonance interactions .",
    "when the energy is a few gev , deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) dominates , ultimately taking over by about 10 gev , as this cross - section is proportional to the neutrino energy .",
    "there are still issues about the transition from the resonance ( mainly single pion dominated ) region to the dis region @xcite ; however , such errors are minimised by _ always analysing ratios of events_. roughly speaking , in the energy range of interest from few to 10 s of gev , half the events are from quasi - elastic and resonance interactions and the other half from dis .",
    "this proportion is somewhat sensitive to finite detector resolutions , since the neutrino energy is smeared over a much larger range than that observed ; however , the events are still dominantly low - energy ones owing to the steep fall ( faster than @xmath157 ) of the incident atmospheric neutrino flux with energy .",
    "we find , as studies of the probabilities suggest , that variations of the event rates due to uncertainties in @xmath38 and @xmath37 are small .",
    "we therefore fix them to their best - fit values .",

    "the remaining parameters , viz . , @xmath48 ( both magnitude and sign ) , @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( in particular , its deviation from maximality and hence also its octant ) , are the parameters to be determined or constrained in the analysis .",
    "a study of atmospheric neutrino events is sensitive to all these parameters ( but the magnitude of @xmath48 ) only through matter effects .",

    ", we shall assume in the following that @xmath2 is substantial ; the precise threshold will be determined through the analysis .",
    "it is already known that the sign of @xmath48 can be determined via the _ difference asymmetry _ of the up / down ratios in the neutrino and anti - neutrino channels : @xmath158 where @xmath15 and @xmath159 are the relevant differential event rates for up and down events as a function of @xmath41 and @xmath160 and @xmath161 the corresponding rates for anti - neutrinos .",
    "this asymmetry can be maximised by choosing to integrate over @xmath41 bins that include one half - period of the oscillation .",

    "@xcite ; we only remark here that we require @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) for the sign of @xmath48 to be determined using this technique .",
    "furthermore , this determination requires 7501000 kton - year exposure , depending on the value of @xmath2 , thus setting the scale for our present analysis .",
    "we focus therefore on the precision to which the magnitude of @xmath85 and the octant of @xmath0 can be determined , given such large exposures .",
    "( current data from the super - kamiokande collaboration restrict these to the ranges @xmath165 ev@xmath166 and @xmath167 . )",
    "this again depends on @xmath168 , which is expected to be shortly measured with good precision ( to within a few percent ) by the double - chooz experiment @xcite .",
    "we study both cases : when @xmath2 is known and hence kept fixed in the analysis , as well as the case when it is allowed to vary freely .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the normal hierarchy , with @xmath48 positive , so that matter effects ( and hence sensitivity to the octant of @xmath0 ) , are enhanced in the neutrino channel .",
    "we integrate event rates over an energy range of @xmath16910 gev to maximise statistics while retaining sensitivity to matter effects .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltam223 ] we show the variation of the up / down events ratio for different @xmath48 values as a function of @xmath170 for two values of @xmath171 , in two octants . here",
    "@xmath2 is fixed to @xmath172 .",
    "two features are immediately noticeable : ( 1 ) the position of the minima and maxima in @xmath41 are not altered by changing @xmath0 ; furthermore , the events ratio at the first minimum is not very sensitive to @xmath0 , and ( 2 ) the effect of changing @xmath0 from a value in the first octant to a corresponding one in the second octant is to systematically _ decrease the event rates in all bins _ for all @xmath48 values .",
    "furthermore , although not shown in the figure due to constraints of clarity , the curve for maximal @xmath106 lies between the two curves for @xmath173 in all @xmath41 bins beyond the first minimum .",
    "such a systematic decrease with increase in @xmath0 was seen only in some zenith angle and energy ranges ( for example for @xmath174@xmath175 for @xmath67 gev and for @xmath174@xmath176 for @xmath177 gev , when @xmath74 ; see the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:23 t ] ) . by a judicious choice of the energy and @xmath41 interval",
    ", this effect has been converted to a systematic difference for all bins to the right of the first minimum ; moreover , it is in these bins that the sensitivity to @xmath0 is significant , so that this dependence is robust and easy to observe .",
    "note that the difference asymmetry defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : da ] is a difference between neutrino and anti - neutrino rates ratios . in this case , the systematic decrease with increasing @xmath0 is true in _ all _ @xmath41 bins for any @xmath48 value , by definition .",
    "that is , the result for @xmath106 always lies between that for a value of @xmath0 in the first and second octant .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lebin ] .",
    "however , as can be seen from the relative size of the error bars , the task of actually extracting the octant of @xmath0 from measurement of such an asymmetry is severely limited by statistics .",
    "in fact , it is the poor statistics in the anti - neutrino sector that limits the efficacy of this parameter .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath2 away from zero is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltam213 ] where the events ratio is plotted as a function of @xmath178 for different @xmath48 values .",
    "the two histograms for each @xmath48 value correspond to @xmath179 , where the latter value is simply chosen as being within the range allowed by current data and where matter effects are known to be substantial .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath2 is to turn on matter effects that move the muon survival probability maxima ( as a function of @xmath178 ) away from 1 and the minima away from zero .",
    "this means that for non - zero @xmath2 the events ratio is smaller at probability maxima and larger at probability minima than for @xmath84 .",
    "( note that the extent of deviation is somewhat suppressed by the sub - dominant contribution of @xmath36 to the dominant @xmath35 terms ; experiments such as those with neutrino factories where such contamination does not exist will be even more sensitive to matter effects ) .",
    "the contrasting behaviour of the events up / down ratio with @xmath2 and @xmath0 for a given @xmath48 is clear : an increase in the latter systematically decreases the ratio , while an increase in the former decreases the ratio at the @xmath178 maxima and increases them at the @xmath178 minima .",
    "such behaviour enables the extraction of the different parameters when the data is fitted to the theory .    to demonstrate this ( and to determine the efficacy and precision with which the parameters can be determined ) , we begin by computing up / down neutrino events ratios for the set of input parameters , @xmath180 ev@xmath181 , in different @xmath182 bins from 1.6 to 3.4 of width 0.1 each .",
    "we then fit this `` data '' to these three parameters , and extract the allowed parameter space to establish how well these parameters can be determined . in particular , we focus on the precision of measurement of all parameters as well as the possible determination of the octant of @xmath0 .",
    "since we are considering ratios , we include only statistical errors in our analysis .",
    "note that a zenith angle cut on very horizontal events that may not be easily detected by horizontally aligned detectors such as ical / ino only removes the small @xmath41 bins .",
    "for instance , a cut of @xmath183 leads to a cut on @xmath184 .",
    "for such small values , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : deltam213 ] , there is negligible dependence of the up / down ratio on the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "hence , such cuts will not affect our analysis .    fig .",
    "[ fig : m37 ] shows the allowed region at 95% cl and 99% cl in the @xmath185 parameter space , using standard @xmath186 minimisation , for a fixed value of @xmath187 ev@xmath73 . at 95% cl ,",
    "the up / down ratio barely disallows maximal mixing in @xmath0 ; it also disallows the `` wrong '' octant solution of @xmath188 .",
    "however , both these sensitivities go away at the 99% cl level when an island of allowed parameter space opens up around the wrong - octant solution , in a region to the right of it .    at this point",
    "we note that @xmath2 is likely to be rather precisely fixed ( to much better than a percent ) by the double - chooz experiment @xcite .",
    "we therefore observe the effect of keeping @xmath2 fixed and varying the other two parameters .",

    "[ fig : mdelta37 ] where the allowed parameter space in @xmath189 space is shown for the same input parameters as before .",

    "while maximality is still disallowed , a small island opens up around the wrong - octant solution at the 99% cl , again to the right of it .",
    "also , @xmath48 is constrained to a precision of better than 6% at 3@xmath51 .",
    "the results are a complicated function of both @xmath2 and @xmath85 . in general , the wrong - octant and maximal solution is disallowed at 95% cl up to an input value of @xmath190 or @xmath191 , i.e. , a deviation of @xmath192 away from maximal in either direction ( or 10% deviation in @xmath193 ) but is allowed at 99% cl .",
    "this result is mildly dependent on the value of @xmath2 with results obviously improving for larger @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the 99% cl contours for the same input data set are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdelta39 ] for @xmath194 .",
    "the precision in @xmath48 is marginally worse for the larger @xmath2 ; however , although at both values of @xmath2 maximality is disallowed at 99% cl , the wrong - octant solution is completely disallowed only for the larger ( 13 ) mixing angle .",
    "it is possible to reduce the allowed parameter space by adding the contribution of the anti - neutrinos as well .",
    "that is , we now consider the input `` data set '' to consist of both the neutrino and anti - neutrino events ratios .",
    "since we always consider up / down ratios to minimise errors due to overall normalisation of fluxes and cross - sections , this still means that we need to separate the charged muons with good efficiency ( that is , identify the process as originating from a neutrino or anti - neutrino ) . in principle ,",
    "charge misidentification can lead to systematic errors since , for example , a neutrino event wrongly identified not only is lost from its parent sample , but also adds to the anti - neutrino events .",
    "however , in proposed experiments such as ical / ino , charge identification efficiency in this energy range is better than 98% so we ignore such correlation errors .",
    "we show the allowed parameter space on including both the neutrino and anti - neutrino data sample in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdelta7 ] . here",
    "the complex dependence on the input value of @xmath48 is also shown : as @xmath85 is increased between its current 1@xmath51 allowed values of @xmath195@xmath196 ev@xmath73 , the allowed parameter space in @xmath189 around the wrong - octant solution shrinks , and disappears at the upper value of @xmath48 .",
    "hence , it appears that deviations from maximality as well as determination of the octant can be typically easily established at the 95% cl level , provided @xmath2 is well - known ( and at least of the order @xmath197 ) .",
    "results at the 99% cl level are harder to quantify and reflect the complex nature of this many - parameter problem .",
    "we now ask how sensitive these results are to the finite resolution ( in determining neutrino energy and direction , and hence its @xmath41 ) of the detector .",
    "inclusion of finite detector resolution reduces the sensitivity , especially beyond the first oscillation minimum and maximum in @xmath41 .",
    "the smearing in direction affects the resolution in path - length .",
    "a straightforward way to include such effects is to smear the observed energy and direction of the neutrino with gaussian resolution functions : @xmath198~ ; \\\\ \\nonumber r_2(l ' , l ) & \\equiv & \\by{1}{\\sqrt{{2}{\\pi}}\\sigma_l } \\exp \\left [ \\by{-(l - l')^2}{2 \\sigma_l^2 } \\right]~. \\label{resfns}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "the smearing in @xmath6 actually arises because of the uncertainties involved in reconstructing the neutrino direction .",

    "a comparison with the similar fig .

    "it is seen that the peaks and troughs are better defined when smearing in @xmath6 rather than @xmath55 is used .",
    "however , the differences between smearing in @xmath6 and @xmath55 otherwise seem marginal .    hence the effect of detector resolution",
    "is akin to that of increasing @xmath2 , which moves both the minima and maxima of the peaks towards the average value of 1/2 .",

    "[ fig : deltam213 ] , that the distinction between the curves for different @xmath2 is much reduced . in particular , it is likely that other experiments , for example , double - chooz , will be able to resolve @xmath2 with better accuracy .",

    "we repeat the earlier calculation , where contours of allowed parameter space were generated for an input data of up / down neutrino and anti - neutrino event rates in fixed @xmath41 bins for a set of input values for @xmath210 and focus , as before , on the octant resolution .",
    "we find that for resolution widths @xmath211 15% in both @xmath99 and @xmath6 , atmospheric neutrino ( and anti - neutrino ) data accumulated over 1000 kton - years is sufficient to distinguish a non - maximal solution from a maximal solution as well as the octant of @xmath0 for @xmath212 and @xmath213 or @xmath214 .",

    "when resolution functions are included , only maximality can be established ; it is not possible to determine the octant of @xmath0 for any value of @xmath0 allowed by the super - kamiokande results ( see table  [ tab : bestfit ] ) . in this ,",
    "our results differ from those of ref .",
    "@xcite . by itself , this result is not surprising ; otherwise it will imply that 500 kton - year exposure should be adequate for such determinations with normal hierarchy , which is not the case .",
    "neutrino oscillation studies are now moving to the precision determination of oscillation parameters . the most interesting questions in this field today centre around the issue of whether the ( 13 ) mixing angle is different from zero and its implications .",
    "the impact of this fundamental parameter and others were analysed in the first part of this paper .",
    "in particular we find :    * @xmath2 sensitivity : with @xmath2 nonzero , for energies beyond 3 gev , there is a sharp discontinuity in the survival as well as conversion probabilities , @xmath230 and @xmath36 , at the mantle - core boundary at nadir angle @xmath231 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig:13 t ] and [ fig : e13 t ] ) . for small path lengths ( within the mantle )",
    "increasing @xmath2 simply decreases ( increases ) the amplitude of @xmath35 at the maxima ( minima ) without significantly altering the oscillation period .",
    "+ however , as the paths cross the mantle - core boundary and propagate within the core , the matter effects significantly modify the period of oscillations as well , for both the survival and conversion probabilities . in particular , the jump in @xmath36 at the mantle - core boundary becomes larger and more visible with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : e13 t ] ) .",
    "this important feature can be used with long baseline neutrinos for earth tomography studies . * @xmath48 sensitivity : a variation in this parameter changes the period of oscillations , even in the absence of matter effects . for non - zero @xmath2 , with the matter effects turned on , there are dramatic changes in the probabilities , as again both the periods and amplitudes are dramatically altered , especially at around 5 gev .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig:32 t ] ) . at around 2 gev",
    ", a substantial @xmath232 at small nadir angles indicates a rather small @xmath48 , @xmath233 ev@xmath73 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : e32 t ] ) . * @xmath0 sensitivity : for @xmath2 nonzero , we note that as @xmath0 increases from the first octant through to the second octant , the survival probability systematically decreases for most nadir angles in the energy range 510 gev .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig:23 t ] ) .",
    "however , the conversion probability , @xmath232 systematically increases as @xmath0 increases at all nadir angles and all energies .",
    "this is not very significant for atmospheric neutrinos , but can be studied separately with long baseline neutrinos .",
    "finally , the probabilities are sensitive to variations in the prem profile ( within allowed limits ) as also the cp phase . however , these dependences are rather small and insignificant and are unlikely to be measured with atmospheric neutrino studies of the type discussed here . the results discussed for cp phase in this paper can therefore be seen only with long baseline neutrinos when all other parameters are presumably known to good precision .",
    "the probabilities @xmath234 are then used to analyse the atmospheric muon neutrino events to determine the deviation from maximality and/or the octant of the ( 23 ) mixing angle @xmath0 .",
    "such dependence arises purely from matter effects as the neutrinos propagate through earth .",
    "since matter effects are different in the case of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , we assume a detector with charge discrimination capability , such as the proposed ical / ino detector , to heighten the sensitivity to such matter - dependent effects .",
    "moreover , all matter terms are proportional to @xmath5 so we assume that this ( 13 ) mixing angle is different from zero .",
    "we study the up / down events ratios , where by up ( down)-neutrinos , we mean neutrinos arriving at the detector from below ( above ) , so their nadir angles range from 0@xmath235 ( 90@xmath236 ) .",
    "analysis of ratios of events rather than events themselves significantly reduces errors from overall normalisation of fluxes and cross - sections ; the former can be as large as 30% and the latter around 10% .",
    "smearing in energy @xmath99 and base - length @xmath6 by use of gaussian functions is used to simulate finite detector resolutions .",
    "typical relative widths of 15% are used for both energy and base - length . the allowed parameter space obtained on fitting up / down neutrino and anti - neutrino events ratios in any two of @xmath237",
    "is considered .",
    "since the up / down events ratio has very different dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath2 , in principle , they can be simultaneously determined from such studies .",
    "the proposed detectors such as ical / ino with charge identification capability may be in principle suitable for determination of these parameters . in practice , however , these detectors are not well suited for precision determination of @xmath2 with atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "a precise measurement of this parameter is likely to be made , for instance , by the double - chooz experiment .",
    "we summarise below our observations on the simultaneous determination of @xmath238 and @xmath0 from an analysis of the event rates at these detectors with focus on the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "we distinguish three scenarios .",
    "the best case is when both deviation of @xmath0 from maximality as well as its octant can be established . in some cases ,",
    "a maximal value of @xmath0 is disallowed , so deviations from maximality can be established but the octant discrimination may not be possible . the third is where the _ best - fit _",
    "value lies in one of the octants and the region in parameter space around the mirror to the best - fit value in the other octant is ruled out at the precision under consideration ; however , the maximal value is not ruled out at this precision .",
    "in such a case , the allowed parameter space still lies mostly in one octant and hence we consider that we have octant but not maximality discrimination .    *",
    "if @xmath2 is known precisely in the near future , as is likely from double - chooz , then in the energy range @xmath16910 gev , where matter effects are largest , the data from ical / ino will be able to study deviations of @xmath0 from maximality as well as determine the octant of this angle , provided @xmath239 . *",
    "it must be emphasised that the octant discrimination is more easily done than establishing deviation from maximality for larger @xmath2 and the reverse is true for smaller @xmath2 when islands of allowed parameter space begin to appear near the `` wrong octant '' solution .",
    "also , values of @xmath0 in the first octant are more easily distinguished from maximality than those in the second octant .",
    "this result is in contrast to those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . * in particular , deviations from maximality and octant discrimination to 99% cl can be obtained if @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "these studies used standard gaussian resolution functions with widths @xmath242 15% to smear the events . similarly , we must have @xmath243 for corresponding results in the second octant .",
    "* in an earlier paper@xcite , it was also shown that the same processes are also eminently suited to determine the ( 23 ) mass ordering .",
    "both these determinations need large exposures of roughly 1000 kton - years as well as , crucially , the charge discrimination . * as discussed in @xcite , the issue of determining the ( 23 ) mass ordering and hence establishing the neutrino mass hierarchy is best done using the difference asymmetry defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : da ] which is the _ difference _ of the up / down events ratios with neutrinos and anti neutrinos .",
    "for the octant discrimination that is the crux of this paper , the relevant observable is in fact the _ sum _ of these two ratios .",
    "* the same experiment can therefore study both these questions , while requiring large exposures , 1000 kton - years , in both cases .",
    "hence , studies of neutrino oscillations with atmospheric neutrinos , while being difficult , are probably the only source of precision measurements , at least until very large megaton detectors and/or neutrino factories become a reality .",
    "even so , it is important to point out that the determination of the hierarchy is likely to be relatively easier than the octant determination .",
    "this is because , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : lebin ] , the octant effect rides on the hierarchy issue as a sub - dominant effect .    another way to see this is that the octant determination is dominated by the ( anti ) neutrino events ratio in the ( inverted ) normal hierarchy , which are the relevant sectors where matter effects dominate .",
    "since the statistics is smaller by half for anti - neutrinos for the same exposure , the significance of the results deteriorates in the case of inverted hierarchy .",
    "the bulk of the results presented in this paper therefore pertain to the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "results of similar significance can only be established with the inverted mass hierarchy if the exposure is at least twice that for normal hierarchy .",
    "hence , such detectors , with exposures of 1000 kton - year or so , may be able to settle the issue of mass hierarchy but , if the ordering is inverted , the issue of maximality of @xmath0 may remain an open question .",

    "the work of n.s . was partially supported by the department of science and technology , india .",
    "one of the earliest analytical methods for the calculation of oscillation probabilities with variable matter density is in ref .",
    "the oscillation probability was derived assuming matter to be made up of a series of slabs through which neutrinos and anti - neutrinos propagate .",
    "each slab has smoothly varying density , but the density itself has discrete jumps at the junction of adjacent slabs . in a recent paper , akhmedov et al .",
    "@xcite , have provided an excellent collection of approximate analytic formulae for the neutrino oscillation probabilities .",
    "exact analytical formulae have also been derived in the case of vacuum @xcite and for matter with constant density slabs @xcite .",
    "though complicated , exact analytic formulae have been derived for non - uniform density with linear @xcite and exponentially @xcite varying density .",
    "approximate analytic formulae with varying assumptions have been derived in a number of papers @xcite .    here , we use a standard runge - kutta solver to numerically propagate the neutrinos through earth s matter , using the prem earth density profile for a spherical equivalent earth with radius @xmath244 km .",
    "we outline some details about the numerical calculation .",
    "we also highlight how results from an algorithm using constant density slabs differ from those with the prem profile .",
    "our technique is to numerically evolve the flavour eigenstates using the equation , @xmath245 = \\by{1}{2e}\\,\\left ( u m^2   u^\\dagger + { \\cal a } \\right ) \\left [ \\nu_\\alpha\\right]~ , \\eqno(6)\\ ] ] where @xmath246 is the diagonal matrix , diag@xmath247 and @xmath248 $ ] denotes the vector of eigenstates , @xmath249 , @xmath250 . as usual",
    ", @xmath15 is the mns mixing matrix defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : mns ] , @xmath251 is the mass - squared matrix with the diagonal piece proportional to @xmath252 removed : @xmath253 diag@xmath254 .",
    "note that in a constant density slab approximation , the mass eigenstates are propagated , including the `` sudden '' jumps across the density discontinuities .    as mentioned in the text ,",
    "the chief difference between the constant density approximation and the prem profile lies in the resonance effects .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] where the results of using the prem profile in our calculations , and the nuance @xcite result for the same parameters , using constant density slabs , is shown .",
    "here we have set the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath48 ( normal hierarchy ) , @xmath255 and @xmath0 to their best - fit values as given in table  [ tab : bestfit ] and set the cp phase to zero .",
    "we use @xmath86 . for a low value of @xmath256 gev , where resonance occurs in the core",
    ", the constant density slab of nuance does not show resonance since the precise density value needed for resonance does not occur .",
    "of course , matter effects are present and are large ; however , this difference causes the two curves for the neutrino survival probability to begin to separate in this region , as can be seen from the top left panel of the figure .",
    "it is seen that the anti - neutrino probabilities , which are relatively insensitive to matter effects in the normal hierarchy , however , match exactly .    at larger energies , @xmath257 ,",
    "the `` missed '' resonance occurs in the mantle itself .",
    "hence , deviations between the two curves are seen at almost all zenith angles .",
    "the difference can be up to 1015% .",
    "note also that the prominent effect of core - crossing , which occurs at @xmath231 , can be seen clearly in both curves .",
    "again , the anti - neutrino probabilities match .",
    "we have also checked that , by taking smaller and smaller slabs , and approximating the prem profile as closely as possible , the results from the constant density slab approach those using the exact runge - kutta solver with prem profile . however , the resultant increase in number of slabs is quite large .",
