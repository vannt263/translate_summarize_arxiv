    "the present paper is a continuation of works @xcite that deal with spectral asymptotics of a particular class of random hamiltonians , introduced in the following way : starting from an infinite graph one considers subgraphs defined by a percolation process , i.e. , by deleting sites or bonds of the graph , respectively , by means of a random process .",
    "that leads to a random family of laplacians of these subgraphs .",
    "the topic is influenced by two strains of previous development : on the one hand the study of the distribution of spectrum near its minimum .",
    "this takes oftentimes the form of an exponential asymptotics called _",
    "lifshitz tails_. while this has been first analysed for random schrdinger operators on continuum space , the first result concerned with hamiltonians on the lattice @xmath2 is @xcite , which established lifshitz tails for the so - called _",
    "anderson model_. if @xmath3 denotes the integrated density of states at energy @xmath4 and the anderson model is normalized in such a way that zero is the almost sure bottom of the spectrum , @xcite states that @xmath5 .",
    "the value @xmath6 is sometimes called lifshitz exponent . in the present paper we focus on a different , albeit related model , namely a _",
    "percolation hamiltonian _ , sometimes also called _ quantum percolation problem_. it can be viewed as a hard - core anderson model , where  hard - core \" refers to the fact that the potential barrier is impenetrable , i.e. infinitely high . while classical percolation theory started in 1957 with the seminal papers @xcite and has developed in one of the most studied and paradigmatic models of statistical mechanics , the quantum percolation problem was introduced only shorty later , in 1959 , see @xcite .",
    "since then it has been treated both from the theoretical , e.g. in @xcite , as well as from the computational physics point of view e.g. in @xcite .",
    "it seems that the first papers that established basic properties of percolation hamiltonians on the mathematical level of rigour were @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there also the formulation of the quantum percolation problem on cayley and quasi - transitive graphs was given .",
    "the low energy spectral asymptotics for the quantum percolation problem on the integer lattice has been identified in the non - percolating phase in @xcite and subsequently in the percolating phase in @xcite .",
    "these two papers combined establish a phase - transition manifested in the spectral properties of the graph laplacian of the percolation clusters .    in @xcite , relying on @xcite ,",
    "the results of @xcite for the non - percolating regime have been generalized to the setting of amenable cayley graphs . in the present paper",
    "we extend these results to the percolating phase , using an abstract method @xcite , which was already applied in @xcite . if the volume of the balls in the cayley graph grow polynomially with exponent @xmath7 , we prove lifshitz asymptotics with lifshitz exponent @xmath6 as in the case of the @xmath2 lattice .",
    "more generally , for ( possibly ) inhomogeneous graphs where the upper polynomial volume growth bound is complemented by the requirement that arbitrarily large portions of the graph have at least @xmath1-dimensional volume growth , we derive an upper bound on the integrated density of states which corresponds to the lifshitz exponent @xmath8 .",
    "the results hold equally for two types of random hamiltonians : the anderson model and the percolation hamiltonian .",
    "these kinds of models are surveyed in the papers @xcite and @xcite , where also the relation to geometric group theory as well as the underlying stochastic model is reviewed .",
    "as the reader will notice , our methods do not use any kind of geometric or stochastic translation invariance , so that the upper bound we give holds in situations where neither the integrated density of states is defined nor where the usual @xmath9-@xmath10 laws of percolation theory hold .",
    "let @xmath11 be a graph , consisting of countable set of vertices @xmath12 and the set of edges @xmath13 , consisting of sets @xmath14 . since we will assume all our graphs to be undirected and without loops and multiple edges , it is possible and convenient to identify edges with two - element subsets of the set of vertices in this way .",
    "a _ path _ between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a finite family of edges connecting @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the obvious sense .",
    "a _ connected graph _ is a graph which has at least one path between each two vertices .",
    "the _ distance _ between two vertices @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the minimum length of paths between them and is denoted by @xmath17 . the ball of radius @xmath18 at @xmath15 is a subset of @xmath19 denoted by @xmath20 which contains all vertices with distance @xmath18 or less to @xmath15 .",
    "while later we will assume more restrictive conditions , we will now concentrate on the case that @xmath21 which implies , in particular , that the following basic object we look at , the graph laplacian , is a bounded operator : @xmath22 note that , according to our sign convention , @xmath23 defines a nonnegative bounded operator on @xmath24 .",
    "we will be dealing with laplacians on subgraphs that come in the following way ; for a subset @xmath25 the _ induced subgraph _ is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 consists of those edges that join two vertices from @xmath28 .",
    "for such an induced subgraph there are different laplacians on @xmath29 that have been considered : first of all @xmath30 is sometimes called",
    "_ neumann laplacian_. the name is plausible in that @xmath31 has decomposition properties analogous to those of the laplacian with neumann boundary conditions in euclidean space , see lemma [ lemma1.2 ] below .",

    "note that the terminology is different at this point ( it even differs from the one chosen in @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "our nomenclature seems to be justified by the following lemma whose straightforward proof we do not work out here .",
    "we need some notation : let @xmath38 be the form associated with @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath39 finally , the indicator function of the set @xmath40 is denoted by @xmath41 .    [ dirichlet]let @xmath25 .",

    "the discrete topology ) . * @xmath44 in the generalized strong resolvent sense .",
    "* for the natural inclusion @xmath45 @xmath46 note that @xmath47 is nothing but restriction of functions .    1 .   in many papers , starting with @xcite , the following operator @xmath48 is called dirichlet operator . since it is bounded below by our dirichlet laplacian , the spectral estimates we obtain remain valid for @xmath49 as well .",
    "the advantage of this definition lies in the following property : @xmath50 in the sense of quadratic forms for two disjoint @xmath51 .",
    "the similar inequality is not true for what we call the dirichlet laplacian due to the lack of locality of those operators .",
    "2 .   what we call dirichlet laplacian",
    "sometimes is called pseudo dirichlet or adjacency laplacian or laplacian with simple boundary conditions .",
    "part ( 3 ) of the preceding lemma means that our dirichlet laplacian can be thought of as just truncating the matrix of laplacian of the ambient big graph .",
    "3 .   for a thorough discussion of dirichlet boundary conditions in the general dirichlet form framework see @xcite .",
    "the following lemma is again obviously true :    [ lemma1.1 ] in the sense of quadratic forms we have @xmath52    it is important to know that the neumann laplacians possess a monotonicity property with respect to disjoint union of vertex sets .",
    "the following lemma is easy to prove .",

    "typically , we will be dealing with laplacians on finite subgraphs so that the trace in question is indeed finite .",
    "an evident consequence of the previous lemma is that the eigenvalue counting function for the neumann laplacian is subadditive in the domain .",

    "it is the subgraph of @xmath59 induced by the subset @xmath74 of the vertex set which is formed by the open sites .",

    "we show that the distribution of low lying eigenvalues is very sparse with high probability for a percolation subgraph of a given uniformly polynomially bounded graph @xmath11 .",
    "the latter condition only enters later , see , so for now we just keep the assumptions from the preceding section .",
    "we will look at restrictions of the dirichlet laplacian to finite subsets of the random graph .",
    "in fact , due to the fact that dirichlet boundary conditions are stronger than the random potential , we may rather look at restrictions of @xmath82 , where we use neumann boundary conditions . here",
    "are the details : for @xmath83 define @xmath84    since we are interested in the low lying spectrum , it is important to note that all types of hamilton operators introduced so far are non - negative operators . for finite @xmath85 ,",
    "the graph laplacian @xmath86 has zero in its spectrum and the multiplicity is equal to the number of connected components of @xmath85 . for any finite rank operator @xmath56 denote by @xmath87 its lowest eigenvalue .",
    "the second eigenvalue @xmath88 of the graph laplacian @xmath89 of some @xmath90 finite subset of @xmath19 will play the role of a spectral gap in the sequel .",

    "then , for @xmath123 , @xmath124 .\\ ] ]    this is an immediate consequence of hoeffding s bound , @xcite ; it could also be deduced from chernoff s @xcite and was certainly known much earlier .",

    "this does nt pose a real restriction : if the graph consists of several connected components , all operators we consider decompose and the results we have apply to the individual terms in the sum .    note that this setting is much too general to assure the existence of the integrated density of states ( ids ) .",
