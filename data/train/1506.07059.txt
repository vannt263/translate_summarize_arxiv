    "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is a multicarrier modulation method utilizing the orthogonality of subcarriers .",
    "ofdm has been adopted as a standard modulation method in many wireless communication systems such as digital audio broadcasting ( dab ) , digital video broadcasting ( dvb ) , ieee 802.11 wireless local area network ( wlan ) , and ieee 802.16 wireless metropolitan area network ( wman ) .",
    "similar to other multicarrier schemes , ofdm has a high peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) problem , which makes its implementation quite costly .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to reduce the papr of ofdm signal sequences . over the last few decades , various schemes to reduce the papr of ofdm signal sequences",
    "have been proposed such as clipping , coding , active constellation extension ( ace ) @xcite , tone reservation ( tr ) , partial transmit sequence ( pts ) @xcite , and selected mapping ( slm ) @xcite@xcite .    like the slm scheme , the pts scheme statistically improves the characteristic of the papr distribution of ofdm signals without signal distortion . in the pts scheme",
    ", the input symbol sequence is partitioned into a number of disjoint input symbol subsequences .",
    "inverse fast fourier transform ( ifft ) is then applied to each input symbol subsequence and the resulting ofdm signal subsequences are combined after being multiplied by a set of rotation factors . next the papr is computed for each resulting sequence and then the ofdm signal sequence with the minimum papr is transmitted .",
    "hill et al . proposed a cyclic shifted sequences ( css ) scheme , where cyclic shift is used instead of multiplying rotation factor to the ofdm signal subsequences @xcite,@xcite , and the css scheme can be viewed as a special case of the pts scheme @xcite .",
    "it is widely known that the css scheme is better than the pts scheme from every aspect .",
    "first , its papr reduction performance is better than the pts scheme s .",
    "second , it is possible to recover the transmitted ofdm signal sequence without side information using some additional techniques at the receiver @xcite,@xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate how to select the shift value ( sv ) sets in order to boost the papr reduction performance of the css scheme .",
    "we introduce some criteria to select the good sv sets considering the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of ofdm signal subsequences , and then verify its validness through simulations .",
    "in an ofdm system , an ofdm signal sequence in time domain is generated by ifft as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of subcarriers , @xmath2 is an input symbol sequence in frequency domain , and @xmath3 is an ofdm signal sequence in time domain .",
    "the papr of the ofdm signal sequence @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the expectation .",
    "[ fig : ccsblock ] shows a block diagram of the ccs scheme testing @xmath7 alternative ofdm signal sequences in total @xcite . in the ccs scheme ,",
    "@xmath8 is divided by a certain partitioning pattern into @xmath9 disjoint subblocks , input symbol subsequences @xmath10 .",
    "then ifft converts the @xmath9 subblocks in frequency domain to the @xmath9 ofdm signal subsequences in time domain @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that both @xmath1 and @xmath9 are integers of power of two .",
    "after that , the @xmath9 ofdm signal subsequences are cyclically shifted and combined together to make the @xmath14-th ( @xmath15 ) alternative ofdm signal sequence as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the leftward cyclically shifted version of @xmath18 by some integer @xmath19 ( @xmath13 ) . as the slm or pts schemes , the candidate with the lowest papr , @xmath20 , is chosen by exhaustive search for transmission with @xmath21 bits side information . by using some additional techniques at the receiver , the side information can be recovered @xcite .",
    "the cyclic shift operation does not destroy the orthogonality between the input symbols @xmath22 s because , as we all know , cyclic shifting in time domain is equivalent to multiplying a corresponding linear phase vector in frequency domain @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we denote @xmath19 as _ a shift value _ and also denote @xmath23 as _ a sv set _ for the @xmath14-th alternative ofdm signal sequence .",
    "clearly , we have to construct @xmath7 sv sets ( @xmath24 ) to implement the ccs scheme testing @xmath7 alternative ofdm signal sequences .    in this letter",
    ", we consider three partition methods , which are random , adjacent , and interleaved partition methods .",
    "the random partition method gives the best papr reduction performance among them while the interleaved partition method gives the worst papr reduction performance but it needs the lowest computational complexity .",
    "in the css scheme , the papr reduction performance depends on how to construct @xmath7 sv sets @xmath25}. considering the fact that the true objective of the ccs scheme is to reduce the probability of the papr exceeding some threshold level rather than to reduce the papr of each alternative ofdm signal sequence itself , we may say in general that @xmath7 sv sets that make alternative ofdm signal sequences as statistically independent as possible can perform well .",
    "there are @xmath26 cases of one sv set .",
    "that is , @xmath27 can be varied from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . among these @xmath26",
    "possible sv sets , we select only @xmath7 sv sets in the css scheme . in general , @xmath26 is a huge number and thus it is hard to design @xmath7 sv sets without any criterion , which motivates us to propose criteria to select good @xmath7 sv sets in this letter .",
    "suppose that the components in the ofdm signal subsequence are mutually independent .",
    "that is , @xmath30 are mutually independent for all @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we can select two sv sets , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in this case , the papr reduction performance becomes not good because two alternative ofdm signal sequences ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) generated by using theses two sv sets may have high dependency each other . instead , it is better to select two sv sets such as @xmath34 and @xmath38 , which leads to increasing statistically independency between two alternative ofdm signal sequences ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "that is , in order to generate two alternative ofdm signal sequence with independency , the relative distances @xmath39 for all @xmath31 s have to be distinct from each other .",
    "when @xmath40 , this has to be guaranteed for all possible sv set pairs out of @xmath7 sv sets .",
    "now we obtain the following criterion .    * _ criterion 1 _",
    "* : suppose that we have @xmath7 sv sets ; for every @xmath41 pair out of the @xmath7 sv sets ( @xmath42 ) , the pair should satisfy the condition that the relative distances @xmath43 are distinct from each other for all @xmath31 s .",
    "note that the @xmath44 is valid when the components in all alternative ofdm signal subsequences are mutually independent",
    ". however , actually the ofdm signal subsequence components are not mutually independent because the corresponding input symbol subsequences in frequency domain have @xmath45 zeros . cyclically shifting the ofdm signal subsequence of which the components are correlated",
    "may make the resulting ofdm signal subsequence similar to the original one .",
    "for example , suppose that the acf @xmath46 of the @xmath31-th ofdm signal subsequence @xmath18 has a peak value when @xmath47 .",
    "then cyclically shifting by one can not make @xmath18 much different .",
    "therefore , we have to consider the acf of @xmath18 additionally .",
    "let @xmath48 be the discrete power spectrum of the @xmath31-th ofdm signal subsequence @xmath18 , namely , @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 can have the value of zero or one .",
    "this is due to the assumption that the modulation order of all subcarriers is equal and the average power is normalized to one .",
    "for example , if the interleaved partition is used , @xmath52 and @xmath53 when @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    then the acf @xmath46 is given by inverse discrete fourier transform ( idft ) of @xmath48 .",
    "considering the input symbol sequence @xmath56 has @xmath45 zeros in a certain pattern , the corresponding acf @xmath46 has a specific shape .",
    "here we investigate only the magnitude of the acf because the high peak of the ofdm signal sequence is closely related to the magnitude of components .      in this case",
    ", @xmath48 is an impulse train with an interval of @xmath9 .",
    "then , the acf also becomes the impulse train as @xmath57      in this case , @xmath48 is a rectangular function with a width of @xmath58 .",
    "then the acf becomes the function as @xmath59      in this case , @xmath48 can be viewed as a binary pseudo random sequence .",
    "then the acf has a shape similar to a delta function , where the components except @xmath60 are close to zero .",
    "[ fig : acf ] shows an example of the magnitudes of acfs corresponding to the following power spectrum when @xmath61 and @xmath55 ; @xmath62 for an interleaved partition ; @xmath63 for an adjacent partition ; @xmath64 for a random partition , which is an one zero padded m - sequence with length 31 ; clearly , @xmath65 is a complement of @xmath66 in each partition case , and the shapes of @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 are same .",
    "now we investigate the desirable sv sets with consideration of correlation of the ofdm signal subsequence for three partition cases .      in this case",
    ", the shape of the acf is similar to a delta function .",
    "therefore , the _ criterion 1 _ can be valid criterion .      in this case",
    ", the shape of the acf is the impulse train in ( [ eq : intacf ] )",
    ". then cyclic shift by @xmath58 can not make the ofdm signal subsequence much different .",
    "therefore , _ criterion 1 _ has to be slightly modified as follows .    *",
    "_ criterion 2 _ * : suppose that we have @xmath7 sv sets ; for every @xmath41 pair out of the @xmath7 sv sets ( @xmath42 ) , the pair should satisfy the condition that the relative distances @xmath70 are distinct from each other for all @xmath31 s .      in this case , the shape of the acf in ( [ eq : adacf ] ) is similar to a sinc function",
    ". then cyclic shift by a small integer can not make the ofdm signal subsequence much different . instead",
    ", cyclic shift by an integer close to @xmath71 can make the ofdm signal subsequence much different because the magnitude of the acf in ( [ eq : adacf ] ) has a lower value as @xmath72 gets closer to @xmath71 .",
    "for example , when @xmath61 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : acf ] , the magnitude of the acf has the lowest value when @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the constraint that the relative distances have to be distinct from each other in _ criterion 1 _ should be changed into a stronger constraint as follows .",
    "* _ criterion 3 _ * : suppose that we have @xmath7 sv sets ; for every @xmath41 pair out of the @xmath7 sv sets ( @xmath42 ) , the pair should satisfy the condition that the relative distances @xmath43 are distinct from each other for all @xmath31 s ; furthermore , the mutual differences of the @xmath9 relative distances ( @xmath74 ) should be as close to @xmath71 as possible .",
    "unfortunately , it is very hard to describe the _ criterion 3 _ more clearly , but it gives us an important insight to design the good sv sets for the adjacent partition case .",
    "to verify whether the above proposed criteria are valid , we construct the @xmath7 sv sets in two different ways .",
