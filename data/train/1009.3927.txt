    "astrophysical objects dominated by disks supported against gravity by rotation are ubiquitous .",
    "they range from planetary rings , to planetary systems , to protoplanetary disks , to accretion disks around young stars and compact objects , to spiral galaxies . given that astrophysical disks are common",
    ", it is not surprising that gravitational encounters involving them and other objects occur frequently . in particular , the numerous examples of peculiar galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that tidal interactions between spirals are a key driver of the morphological transformations of galaxies .    beginning in the 1960s , various studies",
    "established that many peculiar galaxies are , in fact , disks in collision @xcite .",
    "however , it was @xcite ( hereafter , tt72 ) who performed the first systematic study of this process , using a restricted three - body technique . in their approach ,",
    "each galaxy was modeled as a point - particle , representing the potential well , surrounded by a disk of non - interacting test particles ( stars ) on circular orbits .",
    "when two such model galaxies pass by one another , their mutual gravitational tidal forcing distorts the disks as traced by the orbital motion of the test particles in the combined potential of the two point - particles . in this manner",
    ", tt72 showed that , contrary to prevailing wisdom , the narrow bridges and tails seen in many peculiar galaxies could be produced by gravity alone , and argued that these features are essentially kinematic in nature .",
    "tt72 s analysis further demonstrated that the bridges connecting pairs of colliding galaxies and the tidal tails that develop continue to lengthen and thin out after an encounter .",
    "the well - known systems ngc 4038 ( the `` antennae '' ) , ngc 4676 ( the `` mice '' ) , and ngc 7252 ( the `` atoms for peace galaxy '' ) all have tails extending 50 - 100 kpc in length @xcite .",
    "the superantennae ( iras19254 - 7245 ) is an extreme case in which the tails span 350 kpc from tip to tip @xcite .",
    "if the galaxies merge , some tail stars may escape the system entirely , but most eventually fall back into the merger remnant , resulting in the formation of `` shells '' and other fine structures associated with elliptical galaxies @xcite through `` phase - wrapping '' @xcite .",
    "tt72 also showed that the efficiency of `` tail - making '' depends sensitively on the inclinations of the disks relative to the orbit plane .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 , which shows the outcome of two of tt72 s simulations in which disks are perturbed by the passage of equal - mass companions on parabolic orbits .",
    "the collisions are co - planar , meaning that the victim disks lie exactly in the orbit plane , but in the top row of figure 1 the encounter is prograde , so that the internal spin of the disk is aligned with the direction of the orbital angular momentum , whereas in the bottom row the two are anti - parallel , defining a precisely retrograde interaction .",
    "it is obvious from visual inspection of figure 1 that prograde encounters can do much more violence to spinning disks than retrograde ones .",
    "tt72 interpreted this difference physically as owing to a `` near - resonance or matching of their [ internal ] orbital speeds with the peak angular motion of the companion . '' in other words , a relatively strong response follows if the spin angular frequency of the disk is aligned with and of similar magnitude to the orbital angular frequency of the collision at pericenter . if the stars in the disk are on circular orbits , but the trajectory of the interaction is non - circular ( as in the examples of parabolic orbits shown in figures 1 ) , then the orbital angular frequency varies with time and the resonance is only temporary ; hence , a `` near- '' or `` quasi - resonance . ''",
    "mathematically , the condition for a strong response is expressed by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the internal rotation velocity and characteristic size of the disk , respectively , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the orbit velocity and separation at pericenter , and @xmath5 the eccentricity of the orbit @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite and @xcite generalized tt72 s modeling by treating the internal gravity of colliding galaxies self - consistently .",
    "these and related studies verified tt72 s claim that tail - making is a kinematic process ( see figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and examined the sensitivity of tail - making efficiency to the distribution of stars in interacting and merging galaxies .",
    "subsequently , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated empirically that the lengths and kinematics of tidal tails also depend critically on the distribution of dark matter surrounding each galaxy .",
    "for the same radial stellar profiles , longer ( shorter ) and more ( less ) prominent tidal tails form in shallower ( deeper ) dark matter potential wells .",
    "in particular , @xcite and @xcite showed that the depth of the dark matter potential is as important in determining the lengths of tidal tails as the orbit ( see e.g. figure 4 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached in studies of local dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "most recently , it has been shown that resonant stripping of stars in disks can alter the mass to light ratios of dwarf galaxies when they encounter more massive systems by removing luminous material more efficiently than dark matter .",
    "the minimal response of the dark matter is expected if its particles move on random orbits , in which case the net perturbation on the halo mostly averages out @xcite .",
    "a similar resonant phenomenon has been suggested to cause the lmc disk to thicken by interactions with the milky way @xcite or more generally in the context of heating and disruption of satellites @xcite .",
    "in addition , the origin of the magellanic stream might have a tidal origin @xcite through interactions between dwarfs in groups @xcite , provided that the magellanic clouds are on their first pericentric passage @xcite .    while these works have elucidated the physics of tail - making and proven that observed peculiar galaxies",
    "are indeed a consequence of collisions and mergers , they have left open a number of important issues .",
    "most previous studies of tidal interactions between disk galaxies have been empirical in nature .",
    "thus , they have identified broad conditions for tidal features to be produced , but have not provided simple criteria for isolating the efficiency of this process on specific parameters of an encounter .",
    "therefore , the circumstances under which very long tails could result , like those in the superantennae , remain uncertain .",
    "moreover , even nearly 40 years after tt72 , there is still considerable confusion in the community regarding galactic bridges and tails , especially in regards to the role played by resonances in their origin .",
    "finally , attempts to reproduce the morphology and kinematics of individual observed systems is greatly complicated by the sensitivity of tail - making to the distribution of dark matter around galaxies .",
    "one approach for dealing with this last issue is to survey the vast parameter space that allows for variations in the orbit , the relative masses and spatial sizes of the luminous galaxies , and the dark matter potentials .",
    "a promising scheme along these lines has been developed recently by @xcite with their identikit algorithm . in what follows ,",
    "we pursue a complementary technique by formulating a simple analytic description of tail - making to understand it from an alternate perspective .",
    "our methodology necessarily entails various approximations and is hence less general than simulation - based procedures , but makes it possible to identify scalings of , and interpret physically , the response of rotating objects to gravitational tidal perturbations .",
    "while our immediate attention is devoted to galactic disks , our formalism is general with respect to the system under consideration , so we anticipate that our analysis will be relevant to a wide range of tidal phenomena .    in  2",
    ", we describe our method for analyzing tidal responses of rotating systems .",
    "we adopt a variant of the impulse approximation in which we allow particles in the perturbed system to move along their internal , unperturbed orbits during the encounter . in  3 ,",
    "we derive analytic expressions in terms of special functions for the velocity perturbations delivered to spinning disks in these interactions , in the case of coplanar collisions .",
    "we do this first for high - speed , straight - line trajectories , in  3.1 , and then for parabolic orbits in  3.2 , the latter based partly on the work of @xcite for tidal interactions between stars .",
    "we present numerical examples and contrast the straight - line and parabolic cases in  3.3 . in  4 , we generalize our formalism to non - coplanar encounters , for both straight - line and parabolic orbits .",
    "we compare the results of our analytic prescriptions to simulations of tidal interactions in  5 .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in  6 .",
    "our approach is based on a variant of the impulse approximation for studying gravitational perturbations on systems . in some respects , our formalism has similarities to that of @xcite , who considered tidal interactions between stars as a means for forming close binaries .",
    "@xcite calculated the response of gas spheres to external gravitational perturbations and the energy deposited into non - radial oscillations . later",
    ", similar analytic estimates of the energy and angular momentum exchange between a circumstellar disk and a passing star on a near - parabolic orbit were inferred by @xcite in the context of accretion disks .",
    "consider a flat , rotationally supported disk of stars , perturbed gravitationally by a passing object . in the usual impulse approximation @xcite , it is assumed that the stars in the perturbed system remain strictly stationary during the course of the encounter .",
    "the tidal force from the perturber relative to the center of mass of the perturbed body is calculated at each location within it from each point along the relative orbit of the interaction .",
    "the total velocity impulse delivered to each star in the perturbed object is then calculated by integrating the force over the entire orbit . in the simplest application of this method",
    ", the perturber follows a straight - line trajectory , as for a high - speed encounter , although as we show in what follows , it is possible to generalize the technique also to parabolic collisions , following @xcite .",
    "the analytic expressions that result from the impulse approximation @xcite give reasonably accurate results for the energy deposited in objects during tidal encounters for systems that are dominated by internal random motions @xcite .",
    "however , this method is not appropriate for capturing the essentials of responses like those in figures 1 because , by construction , it does not distinguish between prograde and retrograde interactions , since the stars in the perturbed body are held fixed during the encounter .    to qualitatively capture the influence of resonances during tidal interactions ,",
    "we employ the following variant of the impulse approximation . during the course of the encounter ,",
    "stars in the perturbed system are allowed to move along unperturbed orbits within their host . for simplicity , we assume that the unperturbed orbits are strictly circular , although modest departures from these paths could , in principle , be handled using epicyclic theory . in this manner ,",
    "the response of a given star will depend not only on its spatial location within the perturbed system , but also its velocity . as we demonstrate explicitly below",
    ", this approach makes it possible to characterize the resonant aspects of tidal interactions that distinguish between prograde and retrograde collisions , as in figure 1 .",
    "if the orbit of the encounter is non - circular , as in the examples that follow , the orbital angular frequency varies with time and , so , a given star within the perturbed system will be in precise resonance with the motion of the perturber for only a limited time .",
    "for this reason , we will refer to the formalism herein as describing _ quasi - resonant _ behavior , meaning that the response only resembles that characteristic of a true resonant interaction .",
    "this meaning should be taken to be equivalent to tt72 s description of tidal interactions between spinning objects as displaying `` near - resonant '' qualities .    to be specific ,",
    "consider a disk of stars on circular orbits comprising the _ victim _ interacting with an object which we will refer to as the _",
    "perturber_. employ a coordinate system with origin at the center of mass of the victim and assume that the disk is razor thin and orient the coordinate system so that the disk is in the @xmath6 plane . then , the coordinate vector to any star within the victim is given by @xmath7 where @xmath2 is constant , because we assume that the unperturbed orbits internal to the victim are circular , and the position vector to the perturber will be denoted by @xmath8 in the sections below , we will consider various choices for the trajectory @xmath9 , which will fix the time - dependence of the components @xmath10",
    ". we will adopt the convention that the unperturbed disk always lies in the @xmath6 plane .",

    "( [ impulse ] ) as the starting point for our analysis . unlike as in the usual impulse approximation",
    "we will allow both @xmath9 _ and _ @xmath28 to vary in time .",
    "we will , however , assume that the trajectory of the interaction , specified by @xmath9 , is prescribed ( i.e. orbital decay is not accounted for ) , and that the orbital motion within the victim , set by @xmath28 , is such that the stars follow their unperturbed motions throughout the course of the interaction .",
    "to illustrate our approach , we begin by considering a coplanar interaction between a perfectly thin , rotating disk of stars and a passing perturber . as noted earlier , the origin of the coordinate system will be at the center of mass of the victim and the coordinate system will be oriented so that the disk lies in the @xmath6 plane . while not general , this case suffices to characterize the dynamics of such encounters ; we will generalize to non - coplanar collisions later .",
    "denote the mass of the victim disk by @xmath14 and that of the perturber by @xmath29 .",

    "the cancellation is more complete and the response is suppressed . for both prograde and retrograde cases , in the limit @xmath68 , a star in the victim can complete many orbits while the perturber is near a particular orbital frequency , resulting in an averaging out of the perturbation , yielding an exponentially suppressed response .",

    "consequently , the resonance is broad and is maximal when the spin frequency of the rotating victim matches the peak orbital frequency of the encounter .",
    "the resonance is broad because the perturbation at each frequency is not applied over many cycles , as for a strictly periodic forcing , so perturbations at slightly off - resonant frequencies do not cancel out completely . however , because the resonance is broad , at each point along the orbit the orbital frequency can be in resonance with parts of the victim disk located at different radii and can therefore act on various locations in the disk at different times .",
    "this feature is interesting for galaxy encounters because it means that the victim can loose baryonic mass from different points in the disk by resonant stripping at various times , making the `` quasi - resonant '' response more damaging than if only certain regions in the disk were being affected .",

    "in particular , the quasi - resonant approximation gives accurate results for high speed encounters , where the effective duration of the encounter is less than or of order the dynamical time of the particles ( `` stars '' ) of the spinning system .",
    "the main reason is that high velocity encounters generate small perturbations of otherwise steady - state systems and keep them in the linear regime , where the analytic approximation is valid .",
    "the quasi - resonant approximation is less accurate for slower encounters , where the tidal forces act over a longer period of time .",
    "this is particularly true for the case of a perturber passing on a parabolic trajectory .",
    "indeed , in these events the numerical simulations show that some mass of the victim galaxy is captured by the perturber .",

    "the lengths of the tails depends on the amount of energy transferred to the victim during an encounter .",
    "prograde encounters with more massive perturbers pump larger amounts of energy into the victims , yielding more extended tails but also introducing asymmetries with the leading tails being more elongated than the trailing ones .",
    "retrograde encounters transfer much less energy into the victim , suppressing the development of tails .",
    "finally , we note that our findings for tail - making during galaxy - galaxy encounters may apply to gas as well .",
