    "the nagel - schreckenberg ( ns ) model holds a central position in traffic modeling via cellular automata , because it reproduces features commonly found in real traffic , such as the transition between free flow to jammed state , start - and - stop waves , and shocks ( due to driver overreaction ) .",
    "this simple model represents the effect of fluctuations in driving behavior by incorporating a stochastic element : the spontaneous reduction of velocity with probability @xmath0 .",
    "although the ns model has been studied extensively , the nature of the transition between free and jammed flow , in particular , whether it corresponds to a critical point , remains controversial @xcite .",
    "modifications in update rules of the ns model have been found to result in a well defined phase transition @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a generalized version of the ns model and showed numerically that free- and congested - flow phases may coexist . while the ns model does not exhibit metastable states , which are important in observed traffic flow , including a slow - to - start rule , such that acceleration of stopped or slow vehicles is delayed compared to that of moving or faster cars , can lead to metastability @xcite .",
    "takayasu and takayasu @xcite were the first to suggest a cellular automaton ( ca ) model with a slow - to - start rule .",
    "benjamin , johnson , and hui introduced a different slow - to - start rule in ref .",
    "@xcite , while barlovic _",

    "other models with metastable states are discussed in refs .",
    "a review of ca traffic models is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the original ns model , at each time step ( specifically , in the reduction substep ) , a driver with nonzero velocity reduces her speed with probability @xmath0 . here",
    "we propose a simple yet crucial modification , eliminating changes in speed in this substep when the distance to the car ahead is greater than the current speed .",
    "we believe that this rule reflects driver behavior more faithfully than does the original reduction step , in which drivers may decelerate for no apparent reason . while one might argue that distractions such as cell phones cause drivers to decelerate unnecessarily",
    ", we can expect that highways will be increasingly populated by driverless vehicles exhibiting more rational behavior .",
    "the modified model , which we call the absorbing nagel - schreckenberg ( ans ) model , exhibits a line of absorbing - state phase transitions between free and congested flow in the @xmath7 plane .",
    "( here @xmath2 denotes the _ density _ , i.e. , the number of vehicles per site . ) the modification proposed here allows us to understand the nature of the phase transition in the original model , and to identify a proper order parameter . the ans model exhibits a surprising reentrant phase diagram .",
    "regarding the nature of the phase transition in the original ns model , the key insight is that , for @xmath8 , it exhibits a transition between an absorbing state ( free flow ) and an active state ( congested flow ) at density @xmath9 , where @xmath1 denotes the maximum speed .",
    "free flow is absorbing because each car advances the same distance in each time step , so that the configuration simply executes rigid - body motion ( in the co - moving frame it is frozen ) .",
    "congested flow , by contrast , is active in the sense that the distances between vehicles change with time . below the critical density ,",
    "activity ( if present initially ) dies out , and an absorbing configuration is reached ; above the critical density there must be activity , due to lack of sufficient space between vehicles .",
    "setting @xmath10 in the original model is equivalent to including a _ source _ of spontaneous activity .",
    "since such a source eliminates the absorbing state @xcite , the original ns model _ does not possess a phase transition for @xmath10_. ( it should nonetheless be possible to observe scaling phenomena as @xmath11 . ) a similar conclusion was reached by souza and vilar @xcite , who drew an analogy between the phase transition at @xmath8 and a quantum phase transition at temperature @xmath12 . in their analogy , @xmath10 corresponds to @xmath13 , for which , _ sensu stricto _ , there is again no phase transition .",

    "it is nonetheless essential to treat configurations with @xmath105 as _ active _ , even if @xmath106 .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the reason for reentrance , that is , why , for @xmath107 , the system reaches the absorbing state for _ large _ @xmath0 as well as small @xmath0 . since deceleration is associated with generation of activity ( i.e. , of speeds @xmath6 ) , a reduction in activity as @xmath0 tends to unity seems counterintuitive .",
    "the following intuitive argument helps to understand why this happens . for @xmath108",
    ", vehicles rarely decelerate if they have sufficient headway to avoid reaching the position of the car in front .",
    "this tends to increase the headway of the car behind , so that ( for @xmath109 ) , all headways attain values @xmath110 , which represents an absorbing configuration . for @xmath49 , a car with speed @xmath53 always decelerates , which tends to increase its own headway . in either case , @xmath8 or @xmath49 , as reduced headway ( i.e. , inter - vehicle intervals with @xmath111 ) is transferred down the line , vehicles may be obliged to decelerate , until the reduced headway is transferred to an interval with headway @xmath30 large enough that no reduction in velocity is required . [ intervals with @xmath112 , which we call _ troughs _ , always exist for @xmath113 .",

    "n events_. for @xmath81 , if only d events ( or only n events ) are allowed , the system attains an absorbing configuration via annihilation of reduced headways with troughs .",
    "thus some alternation between d and n events is required to maintain activity , and the active phase corresponds to intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "these observations are illustrated in fig .",
