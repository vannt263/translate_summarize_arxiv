    "among the different approaches to resolving the conceptual problems of , bohm s approach is perhaps the simplest . in a nutshell ,",
    "it consists in adding the most basic dynamical variables , obeying additional evolution equations , to the description of a quantum system provided by its wave function @xmath1 . for nonrelativistic",
    "the additional variables are the positions of the particles , which evolve according to a `` guiding equation '' naturally suggested by the schrdinger evolution .",
    "this theory  usually called or the pilot - wave theory  is well understood .",
    "it has been analyzed , and its connection with the predictions of orthodox quantum theory explained , in the original papers of bohm @xcite as well as in later works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main problems remaining for the bohmian ( or any other ) approach is to find a _ satisfactory _  quantum theory , a theory that is fully lorentz invariant while avoiding the profound conceptual difficulties of orthodox quantum theory .    in his original papers ,",
    "bohm had an outline for a `` bohmian '' field theory , with fields on space - time as the additional variables .",
    "a year later he proposed a `` bohmian '' model for one dirac particle @xcite , which was subsequently extended by bohm and coworkers to @xmath0 dirac particles @xcite .",
    "for this @xmath0-particle model the additional variables are , as in bohmian mechanics , the positions @xmath2 , of the particles . however ,",
    "in contrast with bohmian mechanics , the guiding equation for this theory    @xmath3    is ultralocal on configuration space : the right hand side of ( [ bohmdirac ] ) depends only upon the value of @xmath1 at the positions of the particles and not upon spatial derivatives of @xmath1 there . here",
    "@xmath4 , taking values in the @xmath0-particle spin space @xmath5 , solves the @xmath0-particle dirac equation ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , with the @xmath10-th dirac @xmath11 matrix @xmath12 at the @xmath13-th of the @xmath0 places , and @xmath14 is defined analogously . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are external electromagnetic potentials .",
    "( we may of course consider particle - dependent masses @xmath17 , charges @xmath18 , and external potentials @xmath19 and @xmath20 , but for simplicity we shall not do so . )",
    "we shall call this model the bohm - dirac model ( bd model ) . just as with bohm s proposal for a field theory ,",
    "the bd model requires for its formulation the specification of a distinguished frame of reference  in terms of which the actual configuration @xmath21 and the generic configuration @xmath22 at time @xmath23 is defined  and in fact the model is not  if @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath25 this model is , and may be formulated in a covariant way : writing @xmath26 for the space - time point along a trajectory , with ( scalar ) parametrization @xmath27 , the guiding equation may be written as @xmath28 with @xmath1 satisfying the dirac equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "note that the right hand side of ( [ bd1particle ] ) , the dirac current @xmath32 , is the simplest 4-vector that can be constructed from the dirac spinor @xmath1 .",
    "note also that the parameter @xmath27 has no intrinsic physical significance , so that equation ( [ bd1particle ] ) is equivalent to @xmath33 with arbitrary positive scalar field @xmath34 .",
    "it is not the field of 4-vectors @xmath35 ( having direction and length ) that determines the particle motion , but rather the field of directions defined by @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , the law for the particle motion could be formulated in a purely geometrical manner as the condition that the dirac current @xmath35 at every point along the trajectory be tangent to the trajectory at that point .    because the dirac current is time - like and divergence free , ( see below ) and the relevant hypersurface @xmath36 . ]",
    "@xmath37 there is a dynamically distinguished probability distribution on the set of particle paths @xmath38 arising from ( [ bd1particle ] ) .",
    "any distribution on this space of paths can be defined by specifying for the path the crossing probability for some given equal - time surface @xmath39 in some lorentz frame .",
    "( by this crossing probability we mean the distribution of the point through which the path crosses @xmath39 , which is the same thing as the probability distribution for the position of the particle in this frame at the given time . )",
    "the distinguished distribution is then defined by the crossing probability for @xmath39 given by @xmath40 on @xmath39 ( with @xmath1 suitably normalized ) , which can be written in a covariant manner as @xmath41 where @xmath42 in the future - oriented unit normal to the surface . for this distribution the crossing probability for any other equal - time surface will also be given by @xmath41 , both for the original frame and any other lorentz frame .",
    "we may roughly summarize the situation by saying that for the distinguished probability distribution , quantum equilibrium holds in all lorentz frames at all times , with the quantum equilibrium distribution given by @xmath43 .",
    "more generally , the crossing probability for any space - like hypersurface @xmath36 will also be given by @xmath41 , with @xmath44 the future - oriented unit normal field to @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , for any oriented hypersurface @xmath36 , the crossing measure ( a signed measure that need not be normalized ) , which describes the expected number of signed crossings through area elements of @xmath36 , with negatively oriented crossings counted negatively , is , for the distinguished distribution , also given by @xmath41 , with @xmath44 now the positively oriented unit normal field to @xmath36 . ) , and whose statistics are governed by the dual 3-form , in the manner just described . ]    the @xmath0-particle bd model ( [ bohmdirac ] ) also has a dynamically distinguished probability distribution on paths . as a consequence of ( [ diracn ] )",
    "@xmath45 satisfies , in the lorentz frame in which the dynamics is defined , the continuity equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 thus , if the joint probability distribution for the positions of the @xmath0 particles is given @xmath43 at some time @xmath48 , then , for the corresponding distribution on paths , it will be given by @xmath43 at all times @xmath23 .",
    "however , even for this distinguished distribution , quantum equilibrium will not in general hold in other lorentz frames : the joint distribution of crossings of equal - time surfaces for other frames will in general not be given by @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the wave function in the relevant lorentz frame)@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , bohm and coworkers have argued that the observational content of this model is as  as the covariant formalism of  : since the predictions for results of measurements for this model can be regarded as reflected in the configuration of various devices and registers  and hence can be derived from probabilities for positions given by @xmath45at a common time in the distinguished frame , these predictions must agree with those of the usual interpretation .",
    "thus no violation of   can be detected in experiments @xcite .",
    "( in particular , the identity of the distinguished lorentz frame can not be ascertained by means of any possible observation . )",
    "lorentz invariance is , however , a delicate issue .",
    "indeed , any theory can be made trivially lorentz invariant ( or invariant under any other space - time symmetry ) , even on the microscopic level , by the incorporation of suitable additional structure @xcite .",
    "for this reason bell has stressed that one should consider what he has called `` serious lorentz invariance , '' a notion , however , that is extremely difficult to make precise in an adequate way @xcite . lacking a general criterion",
    ", we may nonetheless begin to get a handle on `` serious lorentz invariance '' by analyzing some specific models .",
    "if the models involve additional structure , then whether or not we have serious lorentz invariance will depend , of course , upon the detailed nature of this structure .",
    "in @xcite we have considered a model for which the additional structure for a system of @xmath0 ( noninteracting ) dirac particles is provided by a global synchronization among the particles : the trajectories of the particles are such that each one of them at some given space - time point is tangent to a vector field determined , given the wave function , by that point and those points along the trajectories of the other particles with which that point has been `` synchronized . ''",
    "this additional synchronization structure is defined implicitly by the equation of motion and the model is not amenable to a statistical analysis in any obvious way . in other words ,",
    "this model is not statistically transparent ( see section iv of @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , even this model provides a counterexample to the widely held belief that a lorentz invariant bohmian theory for many particles is impossible ( unless only product states are allowed ) . in this regard , see also the local model of squires  @xcite .    in this paper we shall analyze a statistically transparent counterexample , the `` hypersurface bohm - dirac model '' ( hbd model ) .",
    "the basic idea was proposed in @xcite in the context of bosonic quantum field theory : in addition to the wave function and field variables , a distinguished foliation of space - time  a new element of geometrical structure defining simultaneity surfaces  is suggested as an additional dynamical variable of the theory .",
    "these surfaces need not be hyperplanes .",
    "the defining ( ) equations of the theory should describe the evolution of the wave function , the field variables , and the simultaneity surfaces . for a careful philosophical discussion of how this may be compatible with some appropriate notion of relativity , even if the simultaneity surfaces should turn out to be unobservable , see maudlin @xcite .",
    "here we shall consider such a theory , not for fields but for @xmath0 ( noninteracting ) dirac particles .",
    "we shall discuss an as yet incomplete hypersurface bohm - dirac model : the law for the evolution of the foliation is not specified , beyond the requirement that it not involve the positions of the particles .",
    "we present no hypothesis concerning the origin of the foliation , but have in mind that the foliation should ultimately be governed by a lorentz invariant law , one that may , for example , involve the @xmath0-particle wave function .",
    "( for definiteness we shall give some very tentative and less than compelling examples of laws for the foliation in section [ sect : persp ] .",
    ") however , we show in subsection [ subs : qe ] that , regardless of how the foliation is determined , the dynamics of the hbd model preserves the quantum equilibrium distribution on the leaves of the foliation .",
    "thus the model is amenable to the same sort of statistical analysis as for nonrelativistic bohmian mechanics .",
    "this is discussed briefly in subsection [ subs : qm ] .",
    "a general foliation @xmath51 of codimension one on minkowski space @xmath52 can approximately be thought of as a partition of @xmath52 into 3-dimensional hypersurfaces .",
    "these hypersurfaces are the leaves of the foliation .",
    "the simplest way to obtain a foliation is by a smooth function @xmath53 without critical points , i.e. , @xmath54 everywhere .",
    "the level sets @xmath55 are smooth hypersurfaces and form a foliation of @xmath52 . with the one - form @xmath56 , which vanishes on the tangent space of the hypersurface through @xmath57 , we may associate by the lorentz metric the normal vector field @xmath58 . if this is time - like everywhere , and thus the foliation hypersurfaces space - like , we may normalize @xmath58 to obtain a unit normal vector field @xmath59 associated with the foliation @xmath51 .",
    "we shall consider in this paper only space - like foliations , i.e. , foliations by space - like hypersurfaces . while obviously different @xmath60 s may generate the same foliation @xmath51 , the future - oriented unit normal vector field @xmath42 is uniquely determined by @xmath51 .",
    "when does a vector field @xmath61 determine a foliation @xmath51 such that for all @xmath57 , @xmath61 is normal to the tangent space of the foliation hypersurface through @xmath62 ?",
    "if we denote by @xmath63 the one - form associated with @xmath64 by the lorentz metric , then , by frobenius theorem , the necessary and sufficient condition is that @xmath63 be completely integrable , @xmath65 .",
    "apart from the foliation , the other dynamical variables of the hypersurface bohm - dirac model are the usual ones : the wave function @xmath1 , here for @xmath0 dirac particles , and the @xmath0-path , the @xmath0-tuple of ( everywhere either time - like or light - like ) space - time paths , which describes the trajectories of the @xmath0 dirac particles .",
    "covariant laws for these dynamical variables suggest themselves when we write those of the the bohm - dirac model , defined by ( [ bohmdirac ] ) and ( [ diracn ] ) , in a coordinate - free , i.e. , covariant manner .    to achieve this we consider first of all the @xmath1-function in the multi - time formalism : for @xmath0 dirac particles the wave function @xmath66 , @xmath67 , takes values in the @xmath0-particle spin space @xmath5 and satisfies @xmath0 dirac equations @xmath68 @xmath69",
    ". here @xmath70 , with @xmath71 at the @xmath13-th of the @xmath0 places , and @xmath72 is an external electromagnetic potential . (",
    "just as with ( [ diracn ] ) , we may of course consider particle - dependent masses @xmath17 , charges @xmath18 , and external potentials @xmath73 . )",
    "the system of equations ( [ diraceqn ] ) is a covariant version of ( [ diracn ] ) ; in this multi - time form the  of the law for @xmath1 is manifest @xcite . )",
    "we can easily add an explicit interaction potential @xmath74 for the @xmath0 dirac particles , while in the multi - time form this is impossible . ]",
    "the @xmath0 dirac particles are coupled by the common wave function @xmath1 . if this is entangled , we have nonlocal correlations between the @xmath0 particles , despite the fact that the particles are noninteracting",
    ".    we shall now develop the guiding law for the @xmath0-path .",
    "note that the numerator of the right hand side of ( [ bohmdirac ] ) is given by a current @xmath75 , @xmath76 that involves matrix elements of an operator having as factors the 0-component @xmath77 of a 4-vector for all but the @xmath13-th particle .",
    "therefore @xmath75 can be expressed in a covariant manner by replacing @xmath78 in the above expression with @xmath79 , where @xmath42 is the future - oriented unit normal to the @xmath23 = const hyperplanes , @xmath80 moreover , the denominator of the right hand side of ( [ bohmdirac ] ) can be expressed covariantly as @xmath81 .",
    "then the covariant velocity of the @xmath13-th particle  with respect to the time of a lorentz frame with @xmath42 as time axis  is @xmath82 since @xmath83 is independent of @xmath13 , we may reparametrize the paths with a parameter @xmath84 so related to @xmath23 that @xmath85 to obtain @xmath86 more generally , by further reparametrization , we may obtain @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is any positive scalar field .",
    "the physical particle dynamics  i.e . , the @xmath0 space - time paths defined by the equations of motion ( and initial conditions)is invariant under reparametrization .    a manifestly `` parametrization invariant '' formulation of the dynamics  that is , such that a time parameter plays no role  is easily obtained : the space - time paths for the @xmath0 particles are constrained by the currents @xmath75 by requiring that the path for the @xmath13-th particle at the point @xmath89 be tangent to the current @xmath90 evaluated at @xmath91 and at the the intersection points of the paths of the @xmath92 other particles with the @xmath93 const - hyperplane @xmath94 containing @xmath91 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath95 the intersection point of the path @xmath96 with the hyperplane @xmath94 , and by @xmath97 a tangent of ( or the tangent line to ) the path @xmath96 at @xmath95 , we may write the law for the @xmath0-path as @xmath98 using the symbol @xmath99 for `` is parallel to . '' in this geometric formulation the bohm - dirac dynamics depends upon the lorentz frame only via its associated foliation into simultaneity hypersurfaces @xmath94 , and thus naturally extends to an arbitrary foliation @xmath51 of minkowski space - time @xmath52 by curved space - like hypersurfaces : ) or ( [ eq : s ] ) , which need not extend in anything like the same form to a general foliation since the parametrized paths generated by the dynamics need not , in general , respect the foliation . ]    given such a foliation @xmath51 and @xmath100 , let @xmath101 be the intersection of the path @xmath96 with @xmath36 , comprising an @xmath0-path , since they are nowhere space - like , can intersect @xmath36 at most once .",
    "this is the main reason why it is important that the foliation @xmath51 be space - like .",
    "of course , also from the physical point of view a synchronization along space - like hypersurfaces yields a picture which perhaps makes most sense .",
    "we shall assume , without further ado , global existence : that a fragment of an @xmath0-path locally satisfying the hbd tangency condition , see ( [ eq : lawhbd ] ) , can be continued in such a manner that each of its paths @xmath96 intersects every @xmath100 . ] and let @xmath102 be a tangent of ( or the tangent line to ) the path @xmath96 at @xmath101 .",
    "the law of the @xmath0-path @xmath103 for the hypersurface bohm - dirac model is defined by the currents @xmath75 naturally extending ( [ eq : flaths ] ) @xmath104 where @xmath105 , with @xmath42 the future - oriented unit normal vector field associated with @xmath51 , via the hbd tangency condition ( see also fig.[fig : path ] ) @xmath106 [ by considering the action of a suitable lorentz transformation on @xmath107 for arbitrary time - like unit vector @xmath42 ( transforming @xmath42 to @xmath108 ) , one sees that @xmath109 is a positive operator in spin space @xmath110 .",
    "hence @xmath111 is also positive , i.e. , @xmath112 with `` = '' only if @xmath113 .",
    "this means that , where it is nonzero , @xmath75 is future - oriented and , like the path @xmath96 , nowhere space - like . ]",
    "we may also write down the equations of motion in the parametrized form analogous to ( [ eq : bdpara ] ) or ( [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "to do so it is convenient to label the hypersurfaces of the foliation using a function @xmath53 that generates the foliation as described above , and use this hypersurface labeling as the parameter for the particle trajectories  so that @xmath114 is on the hypersurface @xmath55 . from the geometrical characterization of the dynamics ( [ eq : lawhbd ] )",
    "we know that @xmath115 is parallel to @xmath116 , and the scale factor required to ensure @xmath117 for all @xmath13 and @xmath84 is easily seen to be @xmath118 .",
    "therefore @xmath119 for a flat foliation we may choose a lorentz frame such that the foliation hyperplanes are the @xmath120 const - planes , i.e. @xmath121 for all @xmath62",
    ". then @xmath122 and ( [ equ : dyn ] ) reduces to the bohm - dirac law ( [ bohmdirac ] ) .",
    "we shall show now that for the hypersurface bohm - dirac model , with foliation @xmath51 , there is a distinguished probability measure on @xmath0-paths @xmath123 satisfying the hbd tangency condition ( [ eq : lawhbd ] ) , one for which the distribution of hypersurface crossings @xmath124 for @xmath125 depends only upon @xmath1 restricted to @xmath36 ( or , more precisely , to @xmath126 ) for @xmath1 satisfying ( [ diraceqn ] ) .",
    "we shall say that such a distinguished measure , as well as the corresponding hypersurface crossing distribution , is _ equivariant , _ defining _ quantum equilibrium_. the physical significance of the hypersurfaces @xmath125 is thus twofold : they serve ( via ( [ eq : lawhbd ] ) ) to define the motion of the particles , and , for a quantum equilibrium @xmath0-path , it is `` on these hypersurfaces '' that , manifestly , the `` particles are in quantum equilibrium . ''",
    "the natural candidate for the equivariant crossing probability density @xmath127 of the hbd model is given by the obvious covariant extension of the equivariant density @xmath128 of the bd model : @xmath129 to see that this is in fact equivariant , note the following : in view of ( [ eq : flhs ] ) , ( i ) @xmath130 and @xmath131 furthermore , ( ii ) the currents @xmath132 are divergence free : @xmath133 which follows immediately from ( [ eq : flhs ] ) using the dirac equation ( [ diraceqn ] ) and its adjoint .",
    "these two properties of the currents , ( [ eq : bas ] ) and ( [ eq : divfree ] ) , are the key ingredients for the proof of the equivariance of @xmath127 . for any current satisfying ( [ eq : bas ] ) and ( [ eq : divfree ] ) , for the particle dynamics defined by ( [ eq : lawhbd ] ) , @xmath134 is an equivariant probability density for crossings of the leaves of the foliation .",
    "we considered in @xcite satisfies ( [ eq : divfree ] ) but not ( [ eq : bas ] ) . ]",
    "the proof of this assertion consists of two steps : first we determine how an arbitrary probability density @xmath135 on crossings of a foliation hypersurface @xmath36 evolves under the dynamics ( [ eq : lawhbd ] ) , i.e. , we formulate the continuity equation of the hypersurface dynamics . in the second step ,",
    "we show that @xmath136 solves the continuity equation .",
    "it then follows that if the probability distribution of the `` positions of the @xmath0 particles '' on @xmath125 is given by @xmath127 restricted to @xmath36 , then for any other hypersurface @xmath137 , the probability distribution of the `` positions of the @xmath0 particles '' on @xmath138 which emerges by transport according to the dynamics ( [ eq : lawhbd ] ) is given by @xmath127 restricted to @xmath138 .",
    "thus @xmath127 is equivariant .",
    "consider thus two infinitesimally close hypersurfaces @xmath36 and @xmath138 belonging to the foliation @xmath51 .",
    "the probability distribution of the positions of the @xmath0 particles on @xmath36 is given by a density @xmath139 such that @xmath140 by @xmath141 we denote simultaneously an infinitesimal region on @xmath36 around @xmath62 and its area ( i.e. , 3-volume ) .",

    "the statistical analysis of the hypersurface bohm - dirac model can be based on the assumption that the probability distribution on @xmath0-paths is given by the equivariant density @xmath127 ( [ eq : covprop ] ) on some simultaneity surface @xmath36 belonging to the foliation @xmath51 . then , by equivariance , the statistical predictions of the hbd model ( i.e. , the crossing probabilities ) agree with the quantum predictions for positions for any hypersurface in @xmath51 . but",
    "what can be said about the statistical predictions concerning a hypersurface which is not part of a member of @xmath51 ?",
    "for one particle the situation is very simple : from the geometrical formulation of the hbd model ( section [ sect : surf ] ) it follows immediately that the hbd model for one particle is foliation - independent , and in fact is the usual one - particle bohm - dirac theory given by eqs.([bd1particle ] ) and ( [ eq : onepdirac ] ) , with current @xmath209 .",
    "thus in this case the statistical predictions of the model agree with the quantum predictions for position along _ any _ hypersurface .",
    "the situation is analogous for @xmath0 independent particles : if the wave function @xmath1 is a product wave function , @xmath210 , then it follows from the multi - time dirac equation ( [ diraceqn ] ) that @xmath211 satisfies the usual one - particle dirac equation .",
    "furthermore , the path of the @xmath13-th particle is tangent to the one - particle current @xmath212 and thus independent of the paths of the other particles .",
    "moreover @xmath127 is the product of the corresponding 1-particle distributions .",
    "therefore , a product wave function indeed generates a foliation - independent motion , the motion of @xmath0 independent bohm - dirac particles , and we thus have agreement with all the quantum position distributions in this case .    in the general case",
    "the situation is more subtle : if the @xmath0-particle wave function is entangled , it will not in general be the case that the distribution of crossings of hypersurfaces not belonging to the foliation agree with the corresponding quantum position distributions @xcite ( which , in fact , may be incompatible with the crossing statistics for any trajectory model whatsoever )",
    ". however , this disagreement does not entail violations of the quantum predictions , as has been discussed for the case of the multi - time translation invariant bohmian theory in @xcite .",
    "in fact , insofar as results of measurement are concerned , the predictions of our model are the same as those of orthodox quantum theory , for positions or any other quantum observables , regardless of whether or not these observables refer to a common hypersurface belonging to @xmath51 .",
    "this is because the outcomes of all quantum measurements can ultimately be reduced to the orientations of instrument pointers , counter readings , or the ink distribution of computer printouts , if necessary brought forward in time to a common hypersurface in @xmath51 , or even to a single common location , for which agreement is assured .",
    "nonetheless , this situation may seem paradoxical if we forget the non - passive character of measurement in quantum mechanics .",
    "the point is that for bohmian quantum theory , measurement can effect even distant systems , so that the resulting positions  and hence their subsequently measured values  are different from what they would have been had no measurement occurred .",
    "we have presented a hypersurface bohm - dirac model for @xmath0 entangled but noninteracting dirac particles .",
    "this model is a covariant extension of the bohm - dirac model , which involves a foliation by equal - time ( flat ) hypersurfaces , to arbitrarily shaped ( smooth ) hypersurfaces . how natural is this model ?",
    "when looking for a relativistic extension of nonrelativistic bohmian mechanics one inevitably encounters two central , very different problems : that such an extension must involve a mechanism for nonlocal interactions between the particles , and that quantum equilibrium can not hold in all lorentz frames . for both of these problems",
    "the additional space - time structure provided by a foliation yields the most obvious solution : the motion of each particle at a point @xmath57 depends upon the paths of the other particles via the points at which they intersect the leaf of the foliation containing @xmath62 , and we have an equivariant density on the leaves of the foliation .    and",
    "the simplest way to achieve this , in a covariant manner , for a dirac wave function @xmath1 , is via the current ( [ eq : flhs ] ) : form the natural tensor @xmath213 , evaluated at @xmath62 and the other intersection points , and contract in the slots corresponding to the other particles with the @xmath92 unit normals to the hypersurface at the corresponding points , to obtain the divergence - free 4-vector @xmath90 , the tangent to the trajectory at @xmath62 .",
    "thus , _ the dynamics of the hbd model is the simplest lorentz invariant dynamics compatible with the structure at hand , namely , the dirac wave function and the foliation_. furthermore , the simultaneous normal component @xmath214 is an equivariant density on the leaves of the foliation .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the lorentz invariance of the hbd model is  in bell s sense``serious '' only if the foliation is regarded as an additional objective _",
    "dynamical_in contrast to absolute  structure in the theory ( and in the world , if the theory is to describe the world ) .",
    "it is this structure that is the innovation of what has been proposed here and in @xcite , not the model per se , which is indeed a rather straightforward covariant extension of the bd model .",
    "however , in this paper we shall not try to find a `` serious '' law for the foliation @xmath51 or , what amount to the same thing , its normal vector field @xmath42 . as a toy example , however , the foliation law could be given by an autonomous equation for @xmath42 , such as @xmath215 .",
    "another class of toy examples involves a vector field @xmath42 constructed from the wave function @xmath216 : consider the space - time vector fields @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is a point fixed in a  way , for example as a maximum of @xmath219 .",
    "( simply considering @xmath220 is not a good idea , since this will be zero for antisymmetric ( fermion ) wave functions . )",
    "now one may set @xmath42 equal to the integrable , the fourier transformed @xmath221 may be split into @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "the inverse fourier transformed @xmath224 satisfies the integrability condition @xmath225 . ]",
    "part of some @xmath226",
    ".    a further possibility , which may be more serious , is to have , in addition to the particle degrees of freedom , an independent quantum field @xmath227 that determines the foliation .",
    "assume that for any quantum state @xmath15 of the field , @xmath228 is time - like and completely integrable .",
    "then for any state @xmath229 of the particle - field system , set @xmath230 .",
    "suppose that the particle and the field degrees of freedom are both dynamically and statistically independent , i.e. , that there is neither quantum interaction nor entanglement between these degrees of freedom , so that in particular the full wave function @xmath231 .",
    "then we may define the foliation by the normal field @xmath232 .",
    "the @xmath233-field can be regarded as very roughly analogous to a higgs field , producing a kind of spontaneous symmetry breaking , where by choice of @xmath15 a particular foliation is determined , and relativistic invariance thereby broken .",
