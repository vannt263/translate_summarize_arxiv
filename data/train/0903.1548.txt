    "nearby starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) show a plethora of diverse x - ray features : off - center point source emission from x - ray binaries , emission from supernova remnants , diffuse collisionally ionized emission from galactic halos , emission from photoionized narrow line regions ( nlrs ) , as well as the x - ray emission of jets and outflows , including starburst - driven superwinds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "when combined with optical , radio , and infrared emission maps , the spatially resolved x - ray emission allows us to identify important processes associated with the birth and deaths of stars , the size , place , and composition of regions of recent star formation , as well as to gauge the influence of the agn on the nuclear regions of galaxies .",

    "ngc 1365 is special in the sense that several of its multi - wavelength properties are , at first glance , unusual .",
    "( 1 ) the degree of excitation of _ narrow _ emission - lines detected in optical spectra is actually lower in the core region of ngc1365 than in the extranuclear regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "( 2 ) while this could be explained by strong core extinction , a _ broad _ component nevertheless shows up in the balmer lines @xcite .",
    "the width of the broad - line component is @xmath816001900kms@xmath9 and would formally imply a classification as narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy , even though the other properties of ngc1365 do not match that classification .",
    "( 3 ) compared to other samples of seyfert galaxies @xcite , the optical and ir properties of ngc1365 appear to be off the correlations and trends in multi - wavelength diagrams @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) to this adds the recent finding that the x - ray obscuration of ngc1365 , which is unusually variable on very short timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
