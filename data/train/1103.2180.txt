    "it has long been known that properties of galaxies are strongly correlated with environment where galaxies reside .",
    "clusters of galaxies are dominated by red early - type galaxies with little star forming activity , while the dominant population in the low - density field are blue late - type galaxies with significant star formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is suspected that the growth of large - scale structures comes into play and alters galaxy properties during the course of hierarchical assembly .",
    "however , it is not yet clear what physical process(es ) is ( are ) actually responsible for shaping galaxy properties depending on the environment .",
    "distant clusters of galaxies , which tend to be in an active phase of mass assembly , are ideal sites for studying `` directly '' what is really happening along with the cluster growth .",
    "cosmological simulations predict that galaxies and groups are assembled onto massive clusters moving along filamentary structures ( e.g. millennium simulation ; @xcite ) , and in fact , wide - field observations of distant clusters of galaxies have revealed such filamentary large - scale structures around rich clusters up to @xmath10 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . those cluster surrounding regions including in - falling groups and/or filamentary structures are likely to be playing critical roles in the evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "it is reported that the rest - frame ultra - violet(uv)optical colors change sharply from blue to red in such medium density environments ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , suggesting that at least a part of the star forming activities of cluster red galaxies are quenched through some environmental effects _ before _ entering the cluster core region . however",
    ", optical colors do not necessarily provide us with the full picture of star forming activities of galaxies .",
    "in fact , some `` red '' galaxies involve , despite of their red colors , a significant amount of dust - obscured star - formation activity ( e.g. @xcite ; 2009 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; 2010 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such galaxies might be the key population in the `` transition phase '' from blue active galaxies to red quiescent ones .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to quantify star formation activity more robustly using not only colors but also other independent indicators of star formation",
    ".    for this purpose , h@xmath0 emission line ( @xmath11 ) is of great use as it is one of the best indicators of star formation which directly reflects the uv radiation from o- and b - type stars in the  regions and is very well calibrated with local galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , the h@xmath0 line is much less affected by dust extinction or metallicity effect compared to  lines at a shorter wavelength ( @xmath12 ) or uv  optical colors , which are more commonly used in the studies of galaxies in the distant universe .",
    "taking the great advantage of the wide field of view of suprime - cam ( @xcite ) on subaru telescope ( @xcite ) , panoramic narrow - band imaging of h@xmath0 emitters in the distant cluster environment was first conducted by @xcite , who targeted the cl0024 + 16 cluster at @xmath13 over a @xmath14 area centered on the cluster . following this study",
    ", @xcite conducted wide - field narrow - band imaging of h@xmath0 emitters in and around the rxj1716 + 6708 cluster at @xmath15 .",
    "they used the wide - field near - infrared camera , moircs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , on the subaru telescope , and spent 8 pointings to neatly cover the known filamentary structures found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also performed h@xmath0 emitter surveys in the central regions of several ediscs clusters at @xmath160.6@xmath170.8 ( ediscs : @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite studied environmental dependence of star forming activity at @xmath18 based on their h@xmath0 emitters sample from hizels ( which includes several clusters in the cosmos and the ukidss uds fields ) . in spite of the great importance of h@xmath0 surveys of clusters and their surrounding regions to investigate the environmental effects",
    ", the number of h@xmath0 surveys of clusters has still been very limited .",
    "since clusters of galaxies are statistical objects by nature , we desperately need more h@xmath0-based studies of distant clusters that cover a wide area and a long time baseline in order to discuss the environmental variation of star forming galaxies and its evolution .    in this paper",
    ", we present a h@xmath0 emitter survey for another cluster at @xmath19 , cl0939 + 4713 ( abell  851 ) .",
    "this is a very rich cluster and is one of the most famous intermediate redshift clusters .",
    "intensive imaging / spectroscopic surveys of this cluster including the _ morphs _ survey ( @xcite ) have been made by many authors , which include ground - based broad - band imaging ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , narrow - band imaging ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , optical spectroscopy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xciteb ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , hubble space telescope imaging including uv observation ( e.g. @xciteb ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , spitzer mid - infrared imaging ( @xcite ) , sub - millimeter 850@xmath20 m observation ( @xcite ) and vla radio observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this cluster has also been targeted by x - ray observations several times ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray image of this cluster shows two prominent peaks in x - ray emission , which suggests that the abell  851 cluster is a dynamically young system .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  2 , we summarize our project and the concept of this paper . in section  3 ,",
    "we show the selection technique of h@xmath0  emitters at @xmath21 and the derivation of h@xmath0-derived star - formation rates for the selected h@xmath0 emitters .",
    "our main results and discussions are described in sections  4 - 6 , and we summarize our results in section  7 . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 km s@xmath25mpc@xmath25 , which gives a 1@xmath26 scale of 5.41 kpc at the most up - to - date redshift of the abell  851 cluster ( @xmath27 ; @xcite ) .",
    "magnitudes are all given in the ab system .",
    "we have been conducting the panoramic imaging and spectroscopy of cluster evolution with subaru project ( pisces : @xcite ) .",
    "we widely observed x - ray detected rich clusters at @xmath28 mainly using suprime - cam on the subaru telescope , and discovered prominent large - scale structures around each cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ; 2006 ; 2007ab ; 2008 ; 2009ab ; @xcite ; @xcite ; 2008 ) .",
    "we also conducted wide - field mapping of star formation around several clusters by h@xmath0 or  line using available narrow - band filters installed on the suprime - cam or moircs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; 2011 ) .",
    "the narrow - band imaging survey is powerful in the sense that it enables us to conduct a very complete survey of star forming activity in and around clusters .",
    "we can detect emission lines by imaging observations and can measure the line flux throughout the field at the same time ( see also section  3.1 ) .      as a pioneering survey of our pisces project , the abell  851 cluster was studied by @xcite .",
    "they performed @xmath29 imaging of this cluster with suprime - cam covering @xmath30 field and found prominent large - scale structures using the photometric redshift technique .",
    "@xcite performed a wide - field spectroscopic follow - up observation and confirmed that these huge structures are really at the same redshift as of the main cluster .",
    "fortunately , the h@xmath0 line from abell  851 shifts to @xmath319220 which is between the night sky emission lines . we utilize a narrow - band filter nb921 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) installed on the suprime - cam , and using this filter we conduct a wide - field h@xmath0 emitter survey for this cluster . the transmission curve of the nb921 filter is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : filter ] with the velocity distribution of spectroscopically confirmed cluster member galaxies taken from @xcite ( solid - line histogram ) .",
    "we also show the velocity distribution of member galaxies in the filamentary structures located far away from the cluster center taken from @xcite ( dashed - line histogram ) .",
    "no significant difference can be seen between the two distributions , supporting that our narrow - band survey is uniformly sensitive throughout the field .",
    "we also note that the peak of the velocity distribution and that of the filter transmission are slightly different .",
    "we can still detect h@xmath0 emission from cluster member galaxies with the line - of - sight velocities of @xmath34km / s@xmath35km / s , although we need to be careful when deriving physical quantities such as star formation rates ( sfrs ) .",
    "nevertheless , this filter is sensitive to @xmath3670 % of h@xmath0 emission lines of member galaxies throughout the field , and this provides us with a great opportunity to conduct a wide - field h@xmath0 emitter survey in and around the abell  851 cluster .    on top of the suprime - cam @xmath29 imaging data and photometric redshifts ( phot-@xmath37 ) of the abell  851 cluster field taken from @xcite , we have also collected @xmath38-band and nb921 data using suprime - cam covering the same area as the existing @xmath29 imaging data ( i.e. 27@xmath427@xmath5 ) .",
    "the data are reduced in a standard manner using the suprime - cam data reduction pipeline ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in the same way as described in @xcite , and all the images are smoothed to @xmath39 seeing size , which is the worst seeing among our data ( the @xmath40-band data ) .",
    "the exposure times are 30 min and 180 min for @xmath38-band and nb921 , respectively , and the 5@xmath41 limiting magnitudes are 24.0 mag and 24.4 mag , respectively ( measured from the deviation of randomly distributed 3@xmath26 apertures in each image ) .",
    "photometry of sources is performed at the position of @xmath42-band detected objects with @xmath43mag ( @xmath44 ) using sextractor software ( @xcite ) , and we use 3@xmath26 aperture photometry throughout the paper .",
    "we first identify narrow - band excess galaxies using the @xmath45nb921 colors .",

    "[ fig : emitter ] the @xmath45nb921 colors of all galaxies within the observed field against their nb921 magnitudes .",

    "we define the nb921 emitters as those satisfying @xmath45nb921@xmath470.2 and @xmath45nb921@xmath473@xmath41 ( see the magenta crosses above the @xmath45nb921@xmath480.2 line and @xmath45nb921@xmath48 + 3@xmath41 curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : emitter ] ) .",
    "we detect 724 nb921 emitters in total , but a part of these emitters are not necessarily h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath21 since h@xmath49/  emitters at @xmath18 and  emitters at @xmath50 can also be detected as nb921 emitters . however , these contaminations can be relatively easily eliminated based on their broad - band colors . in fig .",

    "we here plot galaxies with @xmath53 ( gray dots ) and all the nb921 emitters selected above ( magenta crosses ) .",
    "we also show the model prediction of colors for galaxies at @xmath540.4 , 0.8 and 1.45 from @xcite .",
    "this color combination clearly separates the h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath19 from other major line emitters at other redshifts , and in fact , these colors are also used in @xcite in order to identify h@xmath0 emitters at a similar redshift ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we define the nb921 emitters distributed in the closed box in fig .",
    "[ fig:2color ] as h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath21 .",
    "we note that this boundary is set by eye , and we may miss a small fraction of real members near the boundary .",
    "however , a small change of this boundary does not change our results at all ( see similar selection method in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "also , this color selection can be applied only for the galaxies that are detected in all @xmath55-bands .",
    "therefore , we do not include any h@xmath0 emitter if it is not detected in any of these bands . however , the quantitative analyses presented in this paper are mainly based on bright galaxies with @xmath56 mag , and are not affected by the faint undetected objects . after application of all these color cuts ,",
    "we are left with 445 h@xmath0 emitters in total in and around the abell  851 cluster throughout the observed field .",
    "this is one of the largest samples of h@xmath0 emitters currently available for distant clusters .",
    "we here briefly describe the powerfulness of the narrow - band survey .",
    "we show a plot showing @xmath57 v.s . @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig : specz_photz ] . the spectroscopic catalog of the abell  851 field is taken from @xcite .",
    "the photometric redshifts are not always perfect , especially for blue star forming galaxies due to the lack of significant features such as 4000  break in their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : specz_photz ] , our photometric redshifts for blue member galaxies sometimes fail and return significantly lower redshifts ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : specz_photz ] ) .",
    "this color dependence of the phot-@xmath37 accuracy makes it difficult to study star forming activity and/or its dependence on environment .",
    "in contrast , narrow - band surveys detect emission lines as an excess of flux at a certain wavelength , and in fact , many of the real members missed in the phot-@xmath37 selection can be _ rescued _ in our narrow - band survey ( see the squares in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : specz_photz ] ) .",
    "thus , we again stress that a more complete sample of star - forming galaxies can be constructed regardless of their colors , through the narrow - band survey ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "then , we estimate the star formation rates ( sfr ) for all the h@xmath0 emitters selected above . at first",
    ", we calculate the h@xmath0 +  line flux ( @xmath59}}$ ] ) , continuum flux density ( @xmath60 ) and rest - frame equivalent width ( ew@xmath61 ) in the following equations : @xmath62}}=\\delta_{\\rm{nb}}\\frac { f_{\\rm{nb } } -   f_{z ' } } { 1-\\delta_{\\rm{nb}}/\\delta_{z'}}\\ ] ] @xmath63 @xmath64 } } ) = ( 1+z)^{-1 } \\frac{f_{\\rm{h\\alpha }   + [ nii]}}{f_c}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) are the fwhms of the @xmath38 and nb921 filters , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the flux densities at @xmath38-band and at nb921 , respectively .",
    "we then multiply 4@xmath71@xmath72 by @xmath73}}$ ] to derive the luminosity @xmath74(h@xmath0 + [ nii ] ) , where @xmath75 is the luminosity distance of 2204 mpc at @xmath27 .    finally , we compute the h@xmath0-based star formation rates , sfr(h@xmath0 ) , using the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation for salpeter ( 1955 ) imf : sfr(h@xmath0)[@xmath76/yr]@xmath77[erg / s ]",
    ". we correct for 30%  line contribution ( e.g. @xcite ) and consider 1 mag extinction in h@xmath0 flux due to dust ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , following our previous studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our selection criteria of h@xmath0  emitters shown in section  3.1 correspond to ew@xmath78(h@xmath0 + ) @xmath3620  and sfr(h@xmath0)@xmath360.3@xmath76/yr , and the typical uncertainty in the sfr(h@xmath0 ) from photometric error is @xmath79/yr .",
    "we should note that the assumptions for  contamination and dust extinction adopted above are somewhat uncertain .",
    "it is reported that the contribution of  emission to the h@xmath0 +  line flux depends on ew(h@xmath0 + ) ( e.g. @xcite ) or b - band luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , the strength of dust extinction can vary a lot ( e.g. depending on the morphological type of galaxies : @xcite ) , and in the extreme cases , it may become a(h@xmath0)@xmath80mag ( e.g. @xcite ) , although the assumption of @xmath811 mag extinction adopted here seems to be valid on average in the distant universe as well and the level of dust extinction at a given sfr does not change strongly with redshift ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xcite examined the spectral type of mips - detected sources and found that many of the mips sources in abell  851 have `` e(a)-type '' spectra ( strong balmer absorption _ and _  emission lines ) , which are interpreted as on - going dusty starbursts ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also noted that a significant fraction ( @xmath8130% ) of `` k+a '' or `` a+k '' galaxies ( strong balmer absorption _ without _  emission lines ) , which are often interpreted as _ post - starburst _ galaxies , are detected in mir ( see also @xcite for the radio continuum detection with vla from k+a galaxies in the abell  851 ) . in the spectroscopic catalog of abell  851 in @xcite ,",
    "22 galaxies with q@xmath823 are detected with mips ( i.e. @xmath83jy or sfr@xmath84m@xmath3/yr ) .",
    "we find that 6 out of these 22 sources have redshifts slightly outside of our h@xmath0 survey ( their h@xmath0 lines fall outside of the fwhm of the nb filter ) , but we can expect to detect h@xmath0 emission from the remaining 16 sources . however , we find that only 8 galaxies ( 50% ) satisfy our h@xmath0 emitter selection criteria , while the remaining 8 galaxies ( 50% ) are not detected in h@xmath0 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "these galaxies are likely to be heavily attenuated by dust , so that even the h@xmath0 emission can not come through .",
    "furthermore , we find a systematic difference in spectral types between h@xmath0-detected and h@xmath0-undetected mips sources ( again , see table 2 ) .",
    "all the h@xmath0-detected mips sources show `` e(a , b , c , n ) '' spectra ( i.e.  emission lines are present in their spectra ) , while many of the h@xmath0-undetected mips sources show `` k+a / a+k '' spectra ( or `` k''-type in two cases ) without  emission lines .",
    "we can also confirm in table 2 that the h@xmath0-undetected mips sources have systematically redder colors than the h@xmath0-detected ones ( @xmath85@xmath40@xmath17@xmath42@xmath86 and @xmath87 for h@xmath0-detected and h@xmath0-undetected objects , respectively ) .",
    "these results suggest that some red galaxies do not show h@xmath0 or  emission lines in spite of their significant amount of hidden star formation activities .",
    "it is naturally expected that star forming galaxies show blue colors because young , massive , hot stars dominate their total light .",
    "therefore , the interpretation for the red galaxies with emission lines is not straightforward .",
    "the most likely interpretation for the red h@xmath0 emitters is that they are _ dusty red galaxies _ ( e.g. @xcite ; 2009 ) .",
    "if a star forming galaxy contains a significant amount of dust , it appears red due to the selective extinction of bluer light , and in some cases , it becomes difficult to be distinguished from passively evolving red galaxies .",
    "furthermore , in the extremely dusty cases , even the h@xmath0 lines are heavily attenuated by dust and large corrections are required to obtain true star formation rates from the observed h@xmath0 intensities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this may explain the fact presented in the previous subsection that optically red mips - detected galaxies in the abell  851 do not show significant h@xmath0 emissions .",
    "an important point here is that , in contrast to the fact that the optically red mips sources in the cluster core are not detected in h@xmath0 , we do find many red h@xmath0 emitters in the group environments .",
    "if there are similar mir - bright dusty red sources in groups , they should _ not _ have been detected in h@xmath0 in the groups , either .",
    "why do only the red star forming galaxies in groups have detectable h@xmath0 emissions ?",
    "a possible answer would be : ( 1 ) the star formation rates of these galaxies in groups are significantly higher and have stronger intrinsic h@xmath0 intensities , and/or ( 2 ) the mode of star formation in these systems is different from the mips sources in the cluster core ( e.g. the location of star formation within galaxies and/or the geometry of dust extinction would be different ) .",
    "it has been reported that there is an excess of ir luminous star forming galaxies in group - like environments in the distant universe .",
    "for example , @xcite studied a supergroup environment at @xmath19 in the mir and showed an excess at the bright end of the ir luminosity function in group environment compared to cluster / field environments . also , @xcite studied the spectra of galaxies in the ediscs clusters at @xmath540.40.8 and showed that the `` e(a)-type '' galaxies ( those having a signature of dusty starburst in their optical spectra ) are most numerous in group environments .",
    "this excess in star forming activity of group galaxies may suggest that galaxy transition is actively taking place in group environments , and some galaxies with exceptionally high sfr may be detected in h@xmath0 . also , recent mir studies of distant clusters at @xmath88 found a large number of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) in the outskirts of clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and so it is likely that such dusty starburst galaxies are included in our red h@xmath0 emitter sample .",
    "in fact , @xcite discovered some red h@xmath0 emitters in the outskirts of a @xmath15 cluster , and found that most of these red h@xmath0 emitters are indeed mir - detected lirgs with significant extinction at h@xmath0 ( @xmath89 mag ) .",
    "@xcite conducted mir spectroscopy for some lirgs in the outskirt of the cl0024 cluster at @xmath21 reported in @xcite .",
    "they identified clear pah emission features from the majority of their targets , suggesting that these lirgs are really dusty starbursts ( agn contribution is small ) .",
    "their mir spectra resemble those of nuclear starbursts rather than normal star formation in disks , and they proposed that such dusty starbursts seen in the outskirts of distant clusters are progenitors of the present - day cluster s0 galaxies ( see also the discussion in section  5.3.2 ) .",
    "however , such extremely active galaxies tend to be more dusty , and it might be difficult to detect their h@xmath0 emission . also , the time - scale of dusty starbursts is not long , typically @xmath90gyr . in our sample , we detect h@xmath0 emission for @xmath812030% of the red galaxies in the west clump and in the groups .",
    "this fraction may be too large , if we assume that they are _ all _ short - lived dusty starbursts .",
    "it is more likely that a gentle mechanism which produces relatively long - lived red star forming galaxies is also at work in the group environment around the abell  851 cluster .",
    "@xcite studied dusty red galaxies in the complex structure of the abell  901/902 clusters at @xmath91 with uv+mir photometry , and found that their specific sfrs are systematically lower than blue star forming galaxies ( see also @xcite and @xcite for their identification of dusty red galaxies ) .",
    "they concluded that the dusty red galaxies in abell  901/902 are `` semi - passive '' rather than intense starbursts .",
    "they also proposed that the origin of such red star forming galaxies is similar to that of `` passive spirals '' ( galaxies with spiral morphology but without on - going star formation activity ; e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although a direct comparison of their results with ours is difficult , a fraction of the red h@xmath0 emitters identified in our survey could be similar to the dusty red galaxies discussed in @xcite which are not strongly star - bursting galaxies but moderately star - forming dusty galaxies .",
    "the existence of a large number of red star forming galaxies and their location ( i.e. preferably in groups ) may indicate that such populations are highly related to the transformation of galaxies due to environmental effects , as there is a hint that the group environment is a key place for galaxy truncation and the formation of s0 galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ; 2009 ) .",
    "it has been reported that the fraction of s0 galaxies in cluster cores dramatically increases from @xmath92 to @xmath93 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and it has been widely discussed in terms of the transformation from in - falling field spirals to cluster s0s as they assemble to clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . to reconstruct the s0 fraction in the nearby clusters , it may be required that galaxies are `` pre - processed '' in group environments ( e.g. fujita 2004 ) , and late - type spirals ( s@xmath94 ) may be transformed into bulge - strong early spirals such as s@xmath95 in the group environment ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , considering the high bulge - to - disk ratios of s0 galaxies , just a simple fading of spiral disks may not be sufficient to produce s0 galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the physical processes which can move the gas toward the galaxy center and can grow their bulges through a new star formation activity would be preferable . the galaxy - galaxy interactions or harassment expected in groups are the best candidates ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) . in this context , many of the red h@xmath0 emitters reported in this paper may be in the phase of growing bulges with significant star formation in the galactic central regions with moderate dust extinction . however , the star formation activity is not as strong as a starburst , and their h@xmath0 emission is still visible through moderate dust extinction .",
    "@xcite studied passive spirals and young s0 galaxies in two clusters at @xmath21 and @xmath96 .",
    "they found that these transitional objects are preferentially seen in the infalling groups , and they also found that some of them are detected in uv .",
    "such galaxies are probably similar populations to our red h@xmath0 emitters . @xcite also examined the uv / optical colors of these objects and proposed that they are likely to be truncated with a long time - scale ( @xmath97gyr ) , qualitatively consistent with our suggestion of long time - scales of the red h@xmath0 emitters in group environment . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found that the star formation is more rapidly truncated in the cluster core environment ( especially for more massive cluster with strong icm ) . in our analysis , we did not find red h@xmath0 emitters in the cluster central region .",
    "this may be because the abell  851 cluster is also a very rich cluster , and possibly red h@xmath0 emitters can not survive in the strong icm in the cluster core ( maybe their star formation is immediately shut off after entering the cluster core ) .",
    "in contrast , the mips - detected galaxies found in the cluster central region would be more intense short - lived starbursts with stronger extinction , probably triggered by galaxy mergers as suggested by @xcite .    unfortunately , we do not have mir data ( which are essential for identifying obscured starbursts ) and high - resolution hst data ( which are also essential to resolve galaxy morphology , mergers and localized star formation ) for the group environments where we find a large number of red h@xmath0 emitters",
    ". these information should be powerful for understanding the physical origin of the pre - processing working in the group environment , which may be closely related to the formation of cluster s0 galaxies .",
    "combining these data with our wide - field h@xmath0 imaging data will be clearly an important future work .      in summary ,",
    "the red h@xmath0 emitters are most commonly seen in galaxy groups around abell  851 .",
    "they are probably related to the physics of the `` pre - processing '' in group environments forming cluster s0 galaxies prior to entering the cluster core .",
    "the physical mechanisms mainly responsible for these populations are likely to be group - specific slow processes such as strangulation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) or harassment - like mechanisms ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latter might be more preferred if they are in the process of morphological change toward the more bulge - dominated early spirals at the same time .",
    "strong dusty starbursts triggered by e.g. galaxy - galaxy interactions or mergers may also be included in our red h@xmath0 emitter sample , as we actually found such a population in the study of the @xmath18 cluster ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is currently difficult to quantify their relative contribution or its redshift evolution .",
    "the most demanding and promising next step is a wide - field observation of the infalling groups in the mir / fir with the future space ir missions .",
    "dusty starbursts should be bright in ir , while gradually fading star forming galaxies would not be so bright in ir .",
    "such surveys will give us a critical information to identify the key process for the evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "our narrow - band h@xmath0 line survey is also capable to study total star formation rate in clusters .",
    "the advantage of the narrow - band survey is that we can trace star forming activity throughout the observed field , and that we do not suffer from a sample selection bias or a completeness correction , which are inevitable for slit spectroscopy .",
    "the wavelength range of the narrow - band filter used in this study is slightly offset from the actual redshift distribution of the cluster member galaxies in h@xmath0 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we correct for it in a statistical manner .",
    "we use the velocity distribution of the spectroscopic members within 0.5@xmath7r@xmath8 from @xcite , and estimate the fraction of h@xmath0 emission from the abell  851 cluster that can be recovered by our nb921 filter . the resultant correction factor",
    "to get the total star formation rate turns out to be @xmath98 ( the uncertainty is given as a 1@xmath41 deviation derived from a bootstrap resampling of the spectroscopic members ) .    following the procedure in @xcite and @xcite , we sum up the star formation rates of h@xmath0 emitters within 0.5@xmath7r@xmath8 from the cluster center to derive @xmath99sfr@xmath100 , where r@xmath8 is the radius within which the mean density is 200 times larger than the critical density of the universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to directly compare our data with previous h@xmath0-based cluster studies over a wide range in redshift , which have been compiled by @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the cluster mass , m@xmath8 , as in @xcite and derive the cluster mass - normalized star formation rate ( i.e. @xmath99sfr@xmath100/m@xmath8 ) .",
    "the r@xmath8 and m@xmath8 are calculated in the following equations : @xmath101 @xmath102 where @xmath41 is the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "using the velocity dispersion of the cluster core galaxies ( @xmath103km / s ; @xcite ) and the cosmological parameters adopted in this paper , we derived r@xmath1042.13 mpc and m@xmath105 .",
    "then , using all galaxies with @xmath45nb921@xmath473@xmath41 , we derived @xmath99sfr@xmath106m@xmath3/yr and the mass - normalized star formation rate of @xmath99sfr@xmath107yr@xmath25/@xmath108 .",
    "these values include the correction for the filter transmission curve as described above ( i.e. a factor of @xmath109 ) , and the error - bars are given as a composite of the photometric errors and the uncertainty of the correction factor .",
    "note that we include all galaxies with @xmath45nb921@xmath473@xmath41 that satisfy the same color selection criteria as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2color ] .",
    "if we use only the secure h@xmath0 emitters as defined in this study ( i.e. @xmath45nb921@xmath473@xmath41 and @xmath45nb921@xmath470.2 ) , these values would become smaller by a factor of @xmath812 ( lower limit ) , and if we use all galaxies with @xmath45nb921@xmath470 , these values would increase by @xmath8125% ( upper limit ) .",
    "although this uncertainty is large , this does not affect our main conclusion .",
    "we expect that the uncertainty regarding the dust extinction may also be very large .",
    "in fact , we derive @xmath99sfr(ir)@xmath110m@xmath3/yr by just summing up the ir - derived sfrs of the 16 mips - detected spec-@xmath37 members listed in table 2 , which is clearly larger than @xmath99sfr(h@xmath0 ) derived above .",
    "although we use a constant 1 mag extinction correction in this paper to make a fair comparison with the values in other works in the literature , it is also essential to study such obscured / hidden activities more in detail with the mir  fir observations ( see some examples of such ir studies of the global evolution of star forming activities in clusters by e.g. geach et al .",
    "2006 ; bai et al .",
    "2007 ; koyama et al .  2010",
    "; haines et al .  2009a ; chung et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_sfr_vs_z ] the values derived above and compare them with those for other clusters in the literature all based on h@xmath0 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this plot clearly shows that the mass - normalized star formation rate of abell  851 is located on the general evolutionary trend with redshift , following approximately @xmath9 . the lower limit in sfr that is used to calculate",
    "@xmath99sfr is slightly different from cluster to cluster , but it is within the range of 0.11 m@xmath3/yr ( dust - free ) . since the integrated sfrs are dominated by galaxies with strong star formation , we do not correct for this effect ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) . the strong evolution of star forming activity in clusters presented above is well consistent with our previous study in @xcite , and this trend is much more significant than the trend of a decrease in the specific star formation rates of _ individual _ galaxies , @xmath111 shown by e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ( see also the h@xmath0-based studies of cosmic star formation history by e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , our result also suggests that cluster environment does indeed accelerate the quenching of activities in galaxies .",
    "we note that this redshift dependence of the cluster mass - normalized star formation rates ( or its scatter ) may be related to the cluster mass growth ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as presented in @xcite , more massive clusters exhibit lower @xmath99sfr@xmath112 ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this may also be related to the fact that the fraction of star forming galaxies is a decreasing function of cluster mass ( e.g. @xcite , but see a different result by @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , a large scatter between clusters is clearly visible even at a fixed redshift in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : total_sfr_vs_z ] .",
    "in particular , the value of abell  851 presented in this paper is significantly different from that of cl0024 cluster at a similar redshift ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : total_sfr_vs_z ] ) .",
    "however , abell  851 is @xmath811 order of magnitude more massive than cl0024 , and both clusters still lie along the general trend of decreasing @xmath99sfr@xmath112 with increasing cluster mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : total_sfr_vs_mass ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we also calculated these values for the west clump of abell  851 in the same way as for the main cluster , adopting the r@xmath8 and m@xmath8 taken from the preliminary result of the optical spectroscopy by @xcite .",
    "we plotted these values for the west clump in figs .",
    "11 and 12 .",
    "interestingly , the west clump of abell  851 is more massive than cl0024 cluster and has a lower value of @xmath99sfr@xmath112 , indicating the importance of the mass of the structure in determining the star forming activity in the system .    we should comment that this simultaneous trend of @xmath99sfr vs. cluster mass and @xmath99sfr vs. redshift makes it difficult to derive any evolutionary trend in star formation activities in clusters .",
    "our fitting of a form @xmath99sfr@xmath113 to the data shown in figs 11 and 12 yielded @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "however , these numbers should be taken as very preliminary because they are based on a small sample .",
    "it should be also noted that , as shown in fig.12 , the low-@xmath37 clusters ( open symbols ) studied so far tend to be more massive , while the high-@xmath37 clusters ( filled symbols ) tend to be less massive . this may have led to an apparently stronger evolutionary trend than the actual one .",
    "it is thus critically important to collect a large number of distant clusters covering various masses and redshifts with future large cluster surveys .",
    "we performed a panoramic narrow - band h@xmath0 emitter survey for an intermediate redshift cluster abell  851 at @xmath1 with suprime - cam on the subaru telescope .",
    "this is one of the most distant wide - field h@xmath0 emitter surveys ever made for clusters .",
    "after selecting the h@xmath0 emitters with color excess in @xmath45nb921 and the broad - band color information , we first map out the spatial distribution of the h@xmath0 emitters around abell  851 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emitters are found throughout the observed 27@xmath427@xmath5 field , suggesting that the large - scale structures identified by our previous optical imaging survey are really located at the cluster redshift and physically associated with the main cluster .",
    "the fraction of h@xmath0 emitters is a strong function of environment and shows a clear decline toward the cluster central region .    the most important result of this study is the color variation of h@xmath0 emitters and its clear environmental dependence .",
    "the majority of the h@xmath0 emitters are blue galaxies with @xmath6 , but we find that @xmath8115% of the h@xmath0 emitters have red colors .",
    "such red h@xmath0 emitters are preferentially found in the group environment relatively far away from the cluster core .",
    "our survey shows that @xmath812030% of h@xmath0 emitters in the west clump and the groups have red colors with @xmath116 , while such red emitters are very rare in and immediately outside of the cluster core ( @xmath1175% )",
    ". some of the red h@xmath0 emitters might be dusty starbursts with significant star formation produced via e.g. galaxy - galaxy interactions or mergers .",
    "however , it would be unlikely that _ all _ the red h@xmath0 emitters are dusty starbursts , because most of the optically red mir - detected galaxies found in the cluster central region are _ not _ detected in h@xmath0 ( and also because the number of red h@xmath0 emitters is apparently too large for their expected short life time )",
    ". therefore , it would be reasonable to interpret that the red h@xmath0 emitters in group environment are generated by relatively gentle and slow processes which are different from those producing mir sources in the core of abell  851 .",
    "also , a large number of the red h@xmath0 emitters found in the groups might be closely related to the `` pre - processing '' contributing to the formation of bulge - dominated cluster s0 galaxies before entering the cluster core region .",
    "we also derived the cluster total star formation rate and the cluster mass - normalized star formation rate by summing up the star formation rates of individual galaxies within 0.5@xmath7r@xmath8 of the main cluster and the west clump .",
    "we confirmed a general trend that the mass - normalized star formation rates increase sharply toward distant clusters following approximately @xmath9 , which turned out to be remarkably consistent with our previous studies , although there is a large scatter between clusters .",
    "this scatter may be related to the variation of the cluster mass at each epoch .",
    "more massive clusters have lower star formation activity inside them , suggesting that the cluster mass growth is related to the suppression of the star formation activity in galaxies .",

    "<S> the survey is sensitive to active galaxies with star formation rates down to @xmath2m@xmath3/yr throughout the 27@xmath427@xmath5 field , and we identified 445 h@xmath0 emitters along the large - scale structures around the cluster . using this sample , we find that ( 1 ) the fraction of h@xmath0 emitters is a strong function of environment and shows a clear decline toward the cluster central region . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that ( 2 ) the color of h@xmath0 emitters is clearly dependent on environment . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the h@xmath0 emitters have blue colors with @xmath6 , but we find h@xmath0 emitters with red colors as well . </S>",
    "<S> such red emitters are very rare in the cluster center or its immediate surrounding regions , while they are most frequently found in groups located far away from the cluster center . </S>",
    "<S> these groups coincide with the environment where a sharp transition in galaxy color distribution is seen . </S>",
    "<S> this may suggest that dusty star formation activity tends to be involved in galaxy truncation processes that are effective in groups , and it is probably related to the `` pre - processing '' that generates present - day cluster s0 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we confirm that ( 3 ) the mass - normalized integrated star formation rate in clusters ( i.e. the total star formation rate within 0.5@xmath7r@xmath8 from the cluster center divided by the cluster dynamical mass ) rapidly increases with look - back time following approximately @xmath9 , and it is also correlated with the cluster mass . </S>"
