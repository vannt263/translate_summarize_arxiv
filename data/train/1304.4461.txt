    "we shall be interested in random schrdinger operators on the cartesian product @xmath2 of @xmath0 and a finite graph @xmath3 with @xmath4 vertices ( bethe strip ) .",
    "equivalently , these can be seen as random schrdinger operators on @xmath0 with matrix - valued potential .",
    "the precise definition is as follows : @xmath5 is a random operator acting on @xmath6 and given by the matrix elements @xmath7 here @xmath8 is a coupling constant , @xmath9 denotes an element of the probability space , @xmath10 is a fixed @xmath11 hermitian matrix , and @xmath12 are independent identically distributed @xmath11 random matrices .",
    "the potential @xmath13 will be denoted @xmath14 .",
    "the question that we shall address is , what is the spectral type of @xmath15 when @xmath16 is small . before stating our results ,",
    "let us review what was previously known .    for the bethe lattice ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 in our notation ) , the spectrum of the unperturbed operator ( @xmath19 ) is purely absolutely continuous and fills the interval @xmath20 $ ] . under mild assumptions on the potential ,",
    "klein showed @xcite that , for small @xmath21 , the spectrum in @xmath22 $ ] is also ( almost surely ) absolutely continuous .",
    "additional proofs and generalizations of this result were found by aizenman , sims , and warzel @xcite , and by froese , hasler , and spitzer @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "aizenman proved @xcite that , for small @xmath16 , the spectrum of @xmath15 outside @xmath23 $ ] is almost surely pure point .",
    "in the recent work @xcite , aizenman and warzel proved the presence of absolutely continuos spectrum thoroughout the interval @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "they found a new mechanism for the appearance of absolutely continuous spectrum , entirely different from the one appearing inside the spectrum of the unperturbed operator , and coined the term `` resonant delocalization '' for it .",
    "as opposed to the absolutely continuous spectrum in the interval @xmath25 $ ] , which appears due to the stability of the absolutely continuous spectrum on the bethe lattice , the absolutely continuous spectrum in @xmath26 \\setminus [ -2\\sqrt{k } , 2\\sqrt{k}]$ ] ( in the lifshitz tails ) appears due to resonances between distant sites .",
    "the interval @xmath27 $ ] is exactly the @xmath28 spectrum of the unperturbed operator ; the importance of the @xmath28 spectrum is further discussed in @xcite and in the survey @xcite by warzel .",
    "the goal of this present work is to extend the result of @xcite to the case @xmath29 of the bethe strip .",
    "we make use of significant parts of the work @xcite ; for the reader s convenience , we denote by statement  x * the generalization of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* statement  x ) .",
    "denote by @xmath30 the eigenvalues of @xmath10 , and let @xmath31~.\\ ] ] our main result is    [ thm : main ] assume that @xmath12 are drawn from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "for any @xmath32 any open interval @xmath33 almost surely has absolutely continuous spectrum of @xmath34 in it , when @xmath35 is sufficiently small .",
    "thus the mechanism of resonant delocalization from @xcite may be extended to the bethe strip , a lattice with loops .",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) for a more general discussion of possible further extensions .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] should also be compared with the result of klein and sadel @xcite ( and its ramification @xcite ) , who proved , under weaker assumptions on the potential @xmath36 , that the spectrum of @xmath34 in @xmath37\\ ] ] is almost surely purely absolutely continuous ; the special case @xmath38 was earlier considered by froese , halasan , and hasler @xcite .",
    "thus we replace the intersection with union ( i.e.  the fastest lyapunov exponent with the slowest one ) and @xmath39 with @xmath40 ( i.e.  the @xmath41 spectrum with the @xmath28 spectrum ) at the price of more restrictive assumptions on @xmath36 , and we only manage to show the existence of absolutely continuous spectrum rather than its purity .",
    "the spectrum outside the set @xmath42 is pure point , as follows from the results of @xcite .",
    "thus our result provides an additional example of the appearance of absolutely continuous spectrum in the @xmath28 spectrum of the unperturbed operator @xmath43 , well outside the @xmath41 spectrum .    theorem  [ thm : main ] will follow from theorems  [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] below .",
    "theorem  [ thm2 ] connects the presence of absolutely continuous spectrum with the ( slowest ) lyapunov exponent @xmath44 , which is defined in the sequel .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] , which holds for any ( independent identically distributed ) random potential @xmath45 with @xmath46 , guarantees that the assumptions of theorem  [ thm1 ] are satisfied for small @xmath16 .",
    "[ thm1 ] for every @xmath32 and any interval @xmath33 one has @xmath47 for sufficiently small @xmath16 .",

    "in particular , this set is a subset of the absolutely continuous spectrum of @xmath15 .",
    "similarly to the results of @xcite , theorem  [ thm2 ] is sharp in the following sense : the spectrum of @xmath34 in @xmath51 is almost surely pure point , as follows from the results of @xcite .    for expositional reasons ,",
    "we first prove    [ thm2 ] @xmath15 has ( almost surely ) no pure point spectrum in the set @xmath52    and then the stronger theorem  [ thm2 ] .",
    "finally , let us comment on the generality of the results .",
    "the simplest generalization of the bethe strip setting of @xcite is the goe potential , corresponding to @xmath18 ( and small @xmath21 ) . in this case , only minor modifications ( due to the non - commutativity of matrix product ) would be required in the arguments of @xcite , since the lyapunov exponents differ from one another by a quantity which vanishes in the limit @xmath53 ( at least , in the sense of theorem  [ thm1 ] ) .    when @xmath54 , additional difficulties arise , which are due to the fact that there may be a significant difference between the fastest and the slowest lyapunov exponent .",
    "most of the current paper is devoted to overcoming these difficulties .",
    "we state the results for the case when @xmath12 are drawn from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble , but the arguments may be extended to more general potentials with off - diagonal disorder .",
    "the crucial requirement is the _ conditional a.c .",

    "we try to indicate where the off - diagonal disorder assumption is used in the proof",
    ".    it would be interesting to extend the results of this paper to the case of diagonal disorder : for example , @xmath12 is a diagonal matrix with independent identically distributed entries ( which would correspond to the usual bethe strip ) .",

    "<S> recently , aizenman and warzel discovered a mechanism for the appearance of absolutely continuous spectrum for random schrdinger operators on the bethe lattice through rare resonances ( resonant delocalization ) . </S>",
    "<S> we extend their analysis to operators with matrix - valued random potentials drawn from ensembles such as the gaussian orthogonal ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> these operators can be viewed as random operators on the bethe strip , a graph ( lattice ) with loops . </S>"
