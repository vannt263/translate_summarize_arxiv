    "starburst galaxies are the primary sources that eject energy and metals into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the properties of the outflow are fundamental to the understanding of the feedback process of galaxies .",
    "the energy and metals of the outflow are generally measured from the x - ray emission , particularly emission lines , associated with starburst galaxies . in past studies , the x - ray emission lines are assumed to come from the hot outflow itself , the temperature and metal abundances of which are extracted based on thermal models .",
    "the x - ray line emission , however , can arise not only from the hot gas , but also from the interaction between the hot gas and the neutral cool gas .",
    "for example , when the solar wind interacts with a comet , the highly ionized ions in the wind can readily pick up electrons from the neutral species of the comet .",
    "the product ions remain highly ionized and are left in excited states .",
    "they will emit x - ray photons when they decay to ground states .",
    "this process is called charge exchange x - ray emission ( cxe , also called charge transfer ) and explains the bright cometary x - ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". it can be represented by : @xmath2 where a highly ionized ion @xmath3 ( like , ) picks up an electron from a neutral species @xmath4 ( like h , h@xmath5 ) , producing an exited ion @xmath6 , which will emit x - ray photons when it decays to the ground state . for the historical studies and recent developments of the cxe , we refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "different from the thermal emission , the cxe contributes only emission lines .",
    "if the x - ray line emission , or part of it , is due to the cxe , the measurement of the thermal and chemical properties of the hot outflow based on thermal - only models will be misleading . to correctly understand the hot outflow , it is crucial to reveal the origin of the x - ray emission lines and to distinguish the contributions from the cxe and the thermal emission .",
    "based on the tight spatial correlation of h@xmath0 and x - ray emissions , @xcite speculated the importance of the cxe between the hot outflow and the cool halo gas for starburst galaxies . from suzaku and observations of the cap above the disk of m82",
    ", @xcite showed a marginal detection of an emission line at 0.459 kev , which may be due to the cxe of cvi ( @xmath7 ) . from epic spectra of the central region of m82 , @xcite also reported two lines ( around 10 and 16  ) , which can not be adequately accounted for by thermal models and may be contributed by the cxe from neutral mg and .",
    "one diagnostic that can be used to determine the origin of the x - ray emission lines is the k@xmath0 triplet between @xmath8 shell and @xmath9 ground state of he - like ions , which consist of a resonance line , two inter - combination lines , and a forbidden line ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "for a thermal plasma , the electron collisional excitation is efficient and favors the resonance line , while for the cxe , the de - excitation favors the triplet states and thus the inter - combination and forbidden lines .",
    "therefore , the line ratios of the triple can determine the origin of the x - ray emission lines .",
    "if the forbidden line dominates , the cxe will be the most feasible origin , because the hot plasma is already highly ionized and photonization is negligible .    in this letter we analyze the k@xmath0 triplets of he - like ions of , , and  of m82 observed by reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs , * ? ? ?",
    "m82 is one of the nearby brightest galaxies in x - ray and regarged as a prototypical starburst .",
    "a bipolar outflow originated from the nuclear starburst extends beyond 5@xmath10 ( about 5 kpc ) from the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have analyzed the rgs  triplet of m82 and they fitted three gaussians to the blended triplet .",
    "they showed that the line intensity ratios are marginally consistent with the cxe . in this letter",
    ", we decompose the triplets into the cxe and the thermal emission using the laboratory measured cxe spectrum of  triplet . as a result",

    "if we know the cxe fluxes of the , , and  triplets , we can estimate the relative abundance of o , ne , and mg with the temperature information .",
    "it provides important insight to the composition of the hot outflow , especially when the assumption of the thermal - only origin of the x - ray line emission is poor .",
    "we will make a first attempt to estimate the relative abundances of o , ne , and mg using the cxe fluxes of their he - like triplets .",

    "the most recent version of science analysis system ( sas , 10.0 ) is used for the reduction of photon events . in these observations ,",
    "the rgs slit is generally not parallel to the outflow direction and the extracted emission lines are broadened due to the tilt of the outflow .",
    "thus we limit our extraction to events within 30@xmath16 radius of the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "we also extract the  triplet from @xmath17 to @xmath18 and from @xmath19 to @xmath20 of the cross - dispersion direction , where the  triplet is bright enough for further study . for the region larger than @xmath20 ,",

    "we see from table 1 that the fluxes of the cxe do not change much for the ne / fe ratios of 1.5 and 4 .",
    "this is because the mixing of  lines is mainly around the resonance line , the ne / fe ratio does have much effect on the relative importance of the resonance and forbidden lines .",

    "we can estimate the relative abundances of o , ne , and mg based on the cxe fluxes of their k@xmath0 triplets .",
    "we consider the case of multiple charge exchange collisions as discussed in  3.1 .",
    "an additional complication is the foreground absorption .",
    "while the column density @xmath61 can be obtained from fitting the whole spectrum as discussed below , here we adopt a column density @xmath62@xmath63 , which is taken from @xcite .",
    "then the absorption factor ( @xmath64 ) relative to the  triplet is 3 and 4.5 for the  and  triplet respectively .",

    "these ratios are similar to the solar ratios of 0.15 and 0.07 , calculated from the solar abundance table of @xcite .",

    "however , the abundance ratios of o , ne , and mg estimated from the cxe are similar to the solar ratios .",
    "therefore , the low abundance of o obtained from thermal - only models is likely to be a consequence of neglecting the cxe .",
    "as the average contribution of the cxe to the triplets is @xmath1 and the contribution differs for different lines , the cxe will affect the estimation of the thermal and chemical properties of the hot gas . in previous studies of m82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is necessary to fit the whole observed spectrum with both the cxe and the thermal emission .",
