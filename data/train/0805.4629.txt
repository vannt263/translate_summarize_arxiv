    "lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is emerging from what should be considered to be a thirty year research and development ( r and d ) phase , into the production phase , where it will produce precise and accurate calculations of non - perturbative strong interaction quantities .",
    "the last five years has seen the field evolve from an era of quenched calculations in small spatial volumes at large lattice spacings , to the present day , where fully - dynamical calculations with chiral symmetry at finite lattice - spacing are standard , the lattice volumes have a spatial extent of @xmath0 and lattice spacings are @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , it is still the case that the light - quark masses , @xmath2 , are larger than those of nature , with typical pion masses @xmath3 .",
    "however , the next five years will see calculations at the physical light - quark masses , @xmath4 , in large volumes , @xmath5 , and at small lattice spacings , @xmath6 become standard .",
    "this impressive evolution will continue with the increasing computer power dedicated to lattice qcd calculations , and development of new and faster algorithms with which to generate lattice configurations , and to compute quark propagators and hadronic observables .",
    "the impact on nuclear physics of being able to reliably compute strong interaction quantities directly from qcd , the underlying theory of the strong interactions , can not be overstated .",
    "while it is important to recover what is known experimentally to high precision , that is obviously not the main objective , and certainly not a good reason to pursue such an effort .",
    "the reason for investing ( both money and careers ) in this area is to be able to calculate quantities of importance that can not be accessed experimentally , or which can be measured with only limited precision .",
    "nuclear physics is an incredibly rich field , whose phenomenology has been explored for decades .",
    "however , there is still little understanding of the connection to qcd and the basic building blocks of nature , quarks and gluons .",
    "such a connection will be firmly established with lattice qcd , and as a consequence , the calculation of quantities that are not experimentally accessible will finally become possible . on a more academic level , lattice qcd will allow for an exploration of how nuclei and nuclear interactions depend upon the fundamental parameters of nature , and an understanding of the fine - tunings that permeate nuclear physics will finally be translated into ( the possible ) fine - tunings of the light - quark masses .",
    "two important examples of how lattice qcd calculations can impact nuclear physics are in the evolution of a supernova and in the structure of nuclei . in the evolution of supernova , one of the key ingredients that determines whether a supernova evolves into a black - hole or a neutron star is the nuclear equation of state ( neos ) .",
    "the neos is determined by the dynamical degrees of freedom and their interactions .",
    "the degrees of freedom at a given density are determined by the mass of the hadrons in the medium , which depends upon their interactions .",
    "for instance , the mass of the @xmath7 is expected to be significantly less than in free - space due to its interactions with neutrons , however , the precise mass - shift is uncertain due to the model dependence of existing calculations  @xcite . as the @xmath7 carries the same charge as the electron , it can become energetically favorable to have the nuclear material composed of neutrons , protons and @xmath7 s , as opposed to just neutrons and protons , due to the location of the fermi - levels . experimentally , little is known about the @xmath7-neutron interaction , and a precise lattice qcd calculation of this interaction , and others , will greatly reduce the theoretical uncertainty in this particular potential contribution to the neos in hadronic systems with densities of a few times that of nuclear matter . as regards the structure of nuclei ,",
    "we now have refined many - body techniques , such as greens function monte - carlo ( gfmc )  @xcite with which to calculate the ground states and excited states of light nuclei , with atomic number @xmath8 . using only the modern nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials that reproduce all scattering data below inelastic thresholds with @xmath9 , such as @xmath10  @xcite",
    ", ones fails quite dramatically to recover the structure of light nuclei .",
    "the inclusion of a three - nucleon interaction greatly improves the predicted structure of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd will be able to calculate the interactions of multiple nucleons , bound or unbound in the same way it can be used to determine the two - body scattering parameters .",
    "for instance , a calculation of the three - neutron interaction will be possible .",
    "the structure and interactions of all nuclei are determined completely by qcd and by the electroweak interactions , primarily electromagnetism .",
    "the lagrange density of qcd is written in terms of the quark and gluon fields , and is manifestly invariant under local @xmath11 transformations . at short - distances",
    "the coupling between the quarks and gluons , and between the gluons and themselves , @xmath12 , is small and allows for processes to be computed as an asymptotic series in @xmath12_asymptotic freedom_. however , as the typical length scale of the process grows , @xmath12 becomes large , and perturbative calculations fail for @xmath13 . at long - distances , and hence low energies , the appropriate degrees of freedom are not the quarks and gluons that the qcd lagrange density is written in terms of , but the hadrons , such as pions and nucleons .",
    "it is the properties of collections of nucleons , hyperons and mesons that defines the field of nuclear physics , a field that , simply put , is the exploration of the non - perturbative regime of qcd . in this low - energy regime , the approximate chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrange density is spontaneously broken by the vacuum , giving rise to pseudo - goldstone bosons and the approximate isospin symmetry .",
    "with such rich dynamics present in what naively looks like a simple theory it is not surprising that relatively little progress has been made in determining the properties and interactions of nuclei , even the simplest nuclei , directly from qcd .",
    "understanding and calculating the properties and interactions of nuclei is further complicated by the fact that nuclear physics , and hence qcd , exhibits one or more fine - tunings .",
    "the values of the light quark masses , the scale of chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath14 , and the electromagnetic coupling constant take values such that the scattering lengths in the two - nucleon systems are both unnaturally large compared with the range of the nuclear interaction .",
    "further , the location of energy - levels in carbon and oxygen are such that the triple-@xmath15 process can proceed to produce enough carbon for us to be writing this review .",
    "of course , one looks toward an anthropic explanation ( for a lengthy discussion of the anthropic principle see ref .",
    "@xcite ) of these fine - tunings , but at present we have no understanding of how the fine - tunings exhibited in nuclear systems translate into fine - tunings in the fundamental parameters of nature ( if in fact they are fine - tuned ) .      the only known way to solve qcd in the low - energy regime is numerically using lattice qcd .",
    "lattice qcd is a technique in which euclidean space correlation functions are calculated by a monte - carlo evaluation of the euclidean space path integral .",
    "the calculations are performed in euclidean space so that contributions to any given correlation function that have a large action are exponentially suppressed .",
    "this is in contrast with minkowski space in which large action contributions result in a complex phase which will average to an exponentially small contribution with nearby paths .",
    "space - time is discretized with the quarks residing on the lattice sites , and the gluon fields residing on the links between lattice sites .",
    "the lattice spacing , @xmath16 , ( the distance between adjacent lattice sites ) is required to be much smaller than the scale of chiral symmetry breaking ( or any physical length scale in the system ) for its effects to be small . the effects of a finite lattice spacing can be systematically removed by combining lattice calculations of the same correlation functions at several lattice spacing with the low - energy effective field theory ( eft ) constructed to explicitly include the lattice spacing .",
    "the efts describing such calculations are somewhat more complicated than their continuum partners as they must reproduce that matrix elements of the symanzik action constructed with higher dimension operators induced by the lattice spacing@xcite .",
    "while the action lacks lorentz invariance and rotational symmetry , it does possess hypercubic symmetry .",
    "as computers have finite memory and performance , the lattice volumes are finite in all four space - time directions .",
    "generally , periodic boundary conditions ( bc s ) are imposed on the fields in the space - directions ( a three torus ) , while anti - periodic bc s are imposed on the fields in the time - direction , which in many cases is much larger than the space - directions  . for the calculations we will be discussing in this review ,",
    "the lattice volumes are large compared with the compton wavelength of the pion , and deviations in single particle properties from their infinite volume values are exponentially small , generically @xmath17 .",
    "finally , the cost of performing lattice calculations increases dramatically with decreasing quark mass , and presently , calculations at the physical quark masses , @xmath18 are not possible .",
    "currently , lattice calculations are performed at unphysical values of the quark masses , and the light quark mass dependence of the observable of interest , which can be determined perturbatively in the low - energy efts , is used to extrapolate to the physical light quark masses .",
    "therefore , the practical situation with current lattice qcd calculations is that they are performed at finite lattice spacing , within finite volumes and at unphysical quark masses . the appropriate eft ( e.g. @xmath19-pt , heavy - baryon-@xmath19-pt )",
    "is then used to extrapolate to the infinite volume , continuum limit of qcd where the parameters of nature reside .      many of the members of the nplqcd collaboration ( of which the authors are a part of and with the logo displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nplqcdlogo ] ) spent years developing efts for nuclear physics , and more generally performing calculations of strong interaction processes in the low - energy regime .",
    "around 2005 , it started to become apparent to us that in order to make progress in low - energy qcd , the approximate chiral symmetries of qcd were , in many cases , no longer sufficient to make predictions for quantities at the precision required to impact experiments , or to shed light on fundamental questions in strong interaction physics .",
    "basically , the number of counterterms that were commonly appearing in calculations beyond leading order ( lo ) or next - to - leading order ( nlo ) were large , and in many instances exceeded the number of experimental measurements that were available or would become available in the near future .",
    "we decided that the only path forward in this area was to use lattice qcd to calculate these counterterms .",
    "the focus of the nplqcd collaboration is to calculate nuclear reactions from lattice qcd , and our initial efforts have focused on calculating the elastic scattering of the lightest hadrons .",
    "it is these calculations that are the focus of this review .",
    "we wish to stress that we would not have been able to perform the calculations in the time frame that we have if it were not for the lattice qcd infrastructure that existed in 2005 and continues to exist and grow in the united states , namely usqcd and the efforts of the lattice group at jefferson laboratory .",
    "the usqcd collaborative effort   has allowed for the large scale production , and more importantly for us , sharing of lattice resources .",
    "the milc collaboration has produced , and continues to produce , multiple staggered ( kogut - susskind ) lattice ensembles at different quark masses , lattice spacing and lattice volumes .",
    "further , nplqcd has shared resources with the lhp collaboration  .",
    "another significant contribution to our program is the software package _ chroma _",
    "@xcite , developed by robert edwards and his team at jefferson laboratory , which we have used extensively to perform our calculations .",
    "in this section we highlight the formal aspects of lattice qcd that have direct bearing on the extraction of scattering and reaction processes in multi - hadron systems .",
    "intricate details of lattice qcd calculations are beyond the scope of this review . in later sections , however , we discuss specific aspects of lattice qcd calculations that are relevant to the discussions at hand . for even finer details ,",
    "we refer the reader to a number of excellent texts on the subject  @xcite . throughout",
    ", we will be discussing lattices with cubic symmetry in the spatial directions , each of length @xmath20 in lattice units .",
    "the time direction is assumed to be much larger than the spatial directions so that all calculations are assumed to be at zero temperature , @xmath21 .",
    "further , while the lattice spacing is conventionally denoted by `` a '' , we will use `` b '' in order to avoid conflict with the notation for scattering lengths which are universally denoted by `` a '' .      in the continuum limit",
    ", the euclidean space correlations functions ( suitably fourier transformed ) are the sums of exponential functions , whose arguments are the product of euclidean time with the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian in the finite - volume associated with eigenstates that couple to the hadronic sources and sinks . at large times , the correlation function becomes a single exponential dictated by the ground state energy and the overlap of the source and sink with the ground state .",
    "as an example , consider the pion two - point function , @xmath22 generated by a source ( and sink ) of the form @xmath23 , @xmath24 the sum over all lattice sites at each time - slice , @xmath25 , projects onto the spatial momentum @xmath26 states .",
    "the source @xmath27 not only produces single pion states , but also all possible states with the same quantum numbers as a single pion .",
    "more generally , the source and sink are smeared over lattice sites in the vicinity of @xmath28 to increase the overlap onto the ground state and lowest - lying excited states .",
    "translating the sink operator in time via @xmath29 gives   @xmath30 at finite lattice spacing , the correlation functions for wilson fermions remain the sum over exponential functions , but for particular choices of parameters used in domain - wall fermions , the correlation functions exhibit additional sinusoidally modulated exponential behavior at short - times ( with a period set by the lattice spacing ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the lowest energy extracted from the correlation function in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : singlepioncorrelator ] ) and ( [ eq : singlepioncorrelatorasymp ] ) correspond to the mass of the @xmath31 ( and more generally the mass of the lightest hadronic state that couples to the source and sink ) in the finite volume .",
    "finite volume effects are exponentially suppressed  @xcite , therefore , while every lattice calculation is performed in a finite volume , as long as the volume is large compared to the pion mass , the mass of stable single particle states can be extracted with high accuracy .",
    "once any correlation function , e.g. @xmath22 , is calculated , the most common objective is to extract the argument of the exponential function that persists at large times .",
    "one way to do this is to simply fit the function over a finite number of time - slices to a single exponential function .",
    "a second method that is perhaps a bit more `` pleasing to the eye '' , is to form the effective mass function , e.g. @xmath32 where both @xmath25 and @xmath33 are in lattice units . at large times",
    ", @xmath33 becomes a constant equal to the mass of the lightest state contributing to the correlation function  .",
    "extracting hadronic interactions from lattice qcd calculations is far more complicated than the determination of the spectrum of stable particles .",
    "this is encapsulated in the maiani - testa theorem  @xcite , which states that s - matrix elements can not be extracted from infinite - volume euclidean - space green functions except at kinematic thresholds  .",
    "this is clearly problematic from the nuclear physics perspective , as a main motivation for pursuing lattice qcd is to be able to compute nuclear reactions involving multiple nucleons .",
    "of course , it is clear from the statement of this theorem how it can be evaded , one computes euclidean - space correlation functions at finite volume to extract s - matrix elements , the formulation of which was known for decades in the context of non - relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite and extended to quantum field theory by lscher  @xcite .",
    "lscher showed that the energy of two particles in a finite volume depends in a calculable way upon their elastic scattering amplitude and their masses for energies below the inelastic threshold .",
    "as a concrete example consider @xmath34 scattering . a @xmath34 correlation function in the @xmath35 representation of the cubic group  @xcite ( that projects onto the s - wave state in the continuum limit ) is @xmath36 in relatively large lattice volumes the energy difference between the interacting and non - interacting two - meson states is a small fraction of the total energy , which is dominated by the masses of the mesons . in order to extract this energy difference the ratio of correlation functions , @xmath37 , can be formed , where @xmath38 and the arrow denotes the large - time behavior of @xmath39 .",
    "the energy eigenvalue , @xmath40 , and its deviation from the sum of the rest masses of the particle , @xmath41 , are related to the center - of - mass momentum @xmath42 by @xmath43 to obtain @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the phase shift , the square of the center - of - mass momentum , @xmath46 , is extracted from this energy shift and inserted into  @xcite @xmath47 which is valid below the inelastic threshold .",
    "the regulated three - dimensional sum is  @xcite @xmath48 where the summation is over all triplets of integers @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and the limit @xmath51 is implicit .",
    "0.15 in    therefore , by measuring the energy - shift , @xmath41 , of the two particles in the finite lattice volume , the scattering phase - shift is determined at @xmath41 . in the absence of interactions between the particles , @xmath52 , and",
    "the energy eigenstates in the finite volume occur at momenta @xmath53 .",
    "it is important to re - emphasize that this relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energies ] ) is valid relativistically  @xcite .",
    "perhaps most important for nuclear physics is that this expression is valid for large and even infinite scattering lengths  @xcite .",
    "the only restriction is that the lattice volume be much larger than the range of the interaction between the hadrons , which for two nucleons , is set by the mass of the pion .    for the scattering of two nucleons , the scattering length is known to be unnaturally large at the physical pion mass , and therefore , the relation in eq .",

    "[ fig : caplot ] one sees that the @xmath270 @xmath241 scattering length tracks the current algebra result up to pion masses that are expected to be at the edge of the chiral regime in the two - flavor sector .",
    "while in the two flavor theory one expects fairly good convergence of the chiral expansion and , moreover , one expects that the effective expansion parameter is small in the channel with maximal isospin , the lattice calculation clearly imply a cancellation between chiral logs and counterterms ( evaluated at a given scale ) .",
    "as one sees in fig .",
    "[ fig : mkakkdataphys ] , the same phenomenon occurs in @xmath131 where the chiral expansion is governed by the strange quark mass and is therefore expected to be more slowly converging . the @xmath271 scattering length ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : muamu ] ) indicates similar behavior but one should keep in mind that this data is expected to contain larger lattice spacing corrections .",
    "this mysterious cancellation between chiral logs and counterterms for the meson - meson scattering lengths begs for an explanation .",
    "one of the ultimate goals of nuclear physics is to compute the properties and interactions of nuclei directly from qcd .",
    "the first , pioneering study of nn scattering with lattice qcd was performed more than a decade ago by fukugita  _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "this calculation was quenched and at relatively large pion masses , @xmath272 .",
    "a fully dynamical lattice qcd calculation of the nn scattering lengths in both the @xmath273-channel and @xmath274-coupled - channels at pion masses of @xmath275 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 in the isospin - limit was performed within the last few years  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the nn scattering lengths upon the light - quark masses has been determined to various non - trivial orders in the eft expansion  @xcite , and is estimated to be valid up to @xmath278 .",
    "the pion mass dependence of nuclear observables may also be explored using a lattice formulation of the low - energy eft of nucleons  @xcite .",
    "the results of the lattice qcd calculation at the lightest pion mass and the experimentally - determined scattering lengths at the physical value of the pion mass are used to constrain the chiral dependence of the scattering lengths from @xmath278 down to the chiral limit .    for an arbitrary nucleus ( or bound and continuum nucleons ) , of atomic number @xmath152 and charge @xmath279 , there are naively @xmath280 contractions that must be performed to produce the nuclear correlation function  , rather than @xmath281 . ] .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath273 channel there are @xmath282 contractions , while in the @xmath274 coupled channels system there are @xmath283 .",
    "the two - nucleon correlator that projects onto the s - wave state in the continuum limit is @xmath284 where @xmath285 denotes the isospin of the nn system and @xmath286 denotes its spin , @xmath287 are isospin - indices and @xmath288 are dirac - indices .",
    "the tensor @xmath289 has elements that produce the correct spin - isospin quantum numbers of two - nucleons in an s - wave .",
    "the summation over @xmath290 ( and @xmath291 ) corresponds to summing over all the spatial lattice sites , thereby projecting onto the momentum @xmath26 state .",
    "the interpolating field for the proton is @xmath292 , and similarly for the neutron .    at the pion masses used in these calculations",
    "the nn scattering lengths are found to be of natural size in both channels , and are much smaller than the @xmath293 lattice spatial extent .",
    "it is noteworthy that the scattering lengths at the heaviest pion mass are not inconsistent with the lightest - mass quenched values of ref .",
    "however , one should keep in mind the effects of quenching on the infrared properties of the theory  @xcite .    a pion mass of @xmath278",
    "is expected to be at the upper limit of where the eft describing nn interactions will be valid  @xcite .",
    "the chiral extrapolation is performed with bbsvk power - counting  @xcite ( @xmath294ksw power - counting  @xcite ) and w power - counting  @xcite in the @xmath273-channel and bbsvk power - counting in the @xmath274 coupled channels .",

    "in addition to the quark - mass dependence these three quantities contribute to the nn systems , there is dependence on the quark masses at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) from pion exchange , and from local four - nucleon operators that involve a single insertion of the light - quark mass matrix , described by the `` @xmath296 '' coefficients  @xcite .",

    "a prediction for the scattering lengths at the physical pion mass is not possible : the experimental values of the scattering lengths are still required for an extrapolation to the chiral limit and naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) is still required to select only those operator coefficients that are consistent with perturbation theory .",
    "the regions plotted in the figures correspond to values of @xmath297  the coefficient of the leading - order quark - mass independent local operator  and @xmath296 that fit the lattice datum and the physical value , and are consistent with nda . in both channels",

    "calculations in larger volumes will be done in the future to verify the expected power - law dependence upon volume that scattering states exhibit .",
    "in addition to discriminating between bound and continuum states , calculations in a larger volume would reduce the energy of the lowest - lying continuum lattice states , and thus reduce the uncertainty in the scattering length due to truncation of the ere .",
    "further improvement would result from measuring the energy of the first excited state on the lattice , either with a single source or by using the lscher - wolff  @xcite method .",
    "the lattice spacing effects in the present calculation appear at @xmath298 ( or exponentially suppressed @xmath111 effects ) , and are expected to be small .",
    "however , the finite lattice spacing effects should be determined by performing the same calculation on lattices with a finer lattice spacing . a theoretical investigation of mixed - action eft for nn scattering which would allow a continuum extrapolation remains to be carried through  -pt in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition to more precise lattice qcd calculations through an increase in computing resources , formal developments are also required . in order to have a more precise chiral extrapolation , calculations in the various relevant efts",
    "must be performed beyond nlo .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that lattice calculations at lower pion masses are essential for the extrapolation to the chiral limit , and will ultimately allow for a `` prediction '' of the physical scattering lengths .        in high - density baryonic systems ,",
    "the large value of the fermi energy may make it energetically advantageous for some of the nucleons to become hyperons , with the increase in rest mass being more than compensated for by the decrease in fermi energy .",
    "this is speculated to occur in the interior of neutron stars , but a quantitative understanding of this phenomenon depends on knowledge of the interactions among the hadrons in the medium .",
    "in contrast to nn interactions , where the wealth of experimental data has allowed for the construction of high - precision potentials , the hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) interactions are only very - approximately known .",
    "experimental information about the yn interaction comes mainly from the study of hypernuclei  @xcite , the analysis of associated @xmath299-kaon and @xmath300-kaon production in nn collisions near threshold  @xcite , and hadronic atoms  @xcite .",
    "there are a total of 35 cross - sections measurements  @xcite of the processes @xmath301 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 , @xmath304 and @xmath305 , and unsurprisingly , the extracted scattering parameters are highly model dependent .",
    "the theoretical study of yn interactions is hindered by the lack of experimental guidance .",
    "the `` realistic '' potentials developed by the nijmegen  @xcite and jlich  @xcite groups are just two examples of phenomenological models based on meson exchange",
    ". these are soft - core potentials with one - boson exchange models of the nn interaction .",
    "since @xmath164 flavor symmetry is broken by the differences in the quark masses , the corresponding couplings are not completely determined by the nn interaction and are instead obtained by a fit to the available data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , six different models are constructed , each describing the available yn cross - section data equally well , but predicting different values for the phase shifts .",
    "the effective field theory approach  @xcite is less developed and suffers from a large number of couplings that need to be fit to the data .    in view of the large uncertainties in the yn scattering amplitudes and their importance for modeling neutron stars and the study of hypernuclei , a first - principles qcd calculation of yn",
    "scattering is highly desirable . the only way to achieve this is through numerical calculations using lattice qcd .",
    "some of the present authors were part of a work  @xcite that outlined a program to address this issue with a combination of lattice calculations and the use of effective field theories .",
    "we have computed the low - energy s - wave phase shifts for yn scattering  @xcite in the @xmath273 channel and @xmath274 coupled - channels at particular energies , using lscher s finite - volume method  @xcite .",
    "no attempt was made to extrapolate to the physical pion mass as it is likely that all but one of the data points lies outside the regime of applicability of the yn efts .",
    "an interpolating field of the form @xmath306 ( a simple product of the single baryon interpolating fields ) was used to determine the energy - eigenvalues of the s - wave strangeness @xmath307 , isospin @xmath308 eigenstates in both spin channels , and an interpolating field @xmath309 to determine the energy - eigenvalues of the s - wave strangeness @xmath307 , isospin @xmath310 eigenstates in both spin channels .",
    "a typical example of the quality of the output of the lattice calculation can be seen in the effective mass plots for @xmath311 in the @xmath273-channel , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : effmassnl1s0 ] .",
    "the plateaus in the effective energy plots persist for only a small number of time - slices . at small @xmath25",
    "there is the usual contamination from excited states whereas at larger @xmath25 the signal - to - noise ratio degrades exponentially with @xmath25 .",
    "the dirichlet boundary at @xmath312 introduces a systematic uncertainty due to backward propagating states . however , in practice , the statistical noise becomes a limiting factor at far earlier time slices and the boundary at @xmath312 is not an issue for this calculation .",
    "we obtained a non - zero energy shift larger than the statistical error in ten of the correlation functions .",
    "it is not clear that we have been able to identify the ground states in all of the correlation functions , e.g. @xmath313 in the @xmath273-channel at @xmath314 , and @xmath311 in the @xmath273-channel at @xmath314 , as the statistics are not sufficient to determine whether the large - time behavior we observe is due to noise or due to the presence of any states with lower energy than those found .",
    "indeed , it would be very exciting if there were states with lower energy , as they would likely be bound states ( based on naturalness arguments and the exact lscher relation ) .",
    ".1 in .2 in      the lightest pion mass at which a signal was extracted is at the upper limits of the regime of applicability of the effective field theories that have been constructed , thus precluding a chiral extrapolation .",
    "however , this work does provide new rigorous theoretical constraints on effective field theory , and potential model constructions of yn interactions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseshcompare ] we compare the lattice values of the phase shifts to recent eft results  @xcite ( squares ) , and to several potential models : nijmegen  @xcite ( triangles ) and jlich  @xcite . at face value",
    "these results appear quite discrepant , however one should keep in mind that extrapolation to the physical pion mass will seriously alter individual contributions to the yn interaction .    while the measurements of the momenta and phase shifts are unambiguous , their physical interpretation is not entirely resolved .",
    "each of the phase shifts at the lowest pion masses are negative . assuming that the observed state is the ground state in the lattice volume",
    ", this implies that the interactions are all repulsive .",
    "the @xmath313 interaction in the @xmath274 coupled channels is strongly repulsive at @xmath314 , while the interaction in the @xmath273-channel is only mildly repulsive .",
    "the opposite is found to be true for the @xmath311 systems at @xmath278 , where the interaction in the @xmath273-channel is found to be strongly repulsive , while that in the @xmath274 coupled channels is mildly repulsive .",
    "however , there may be channels for which there exist states of lower , negative energies , some of which may correspond to bound states in the continuum limit . if such states are present , then we would conclude that the interaction is attractive , and that the positive - shifted energy state we have identified corresponds to the first continuum level .",
    "current statistics are sufficiently poor that nothing definitive can be said about the existence of such states .",
    "energy - independent potentials can be rigorously defined and calculated for systems composed of two ( or more ) hadrons containing a heavy quark in the heavy - quark limit , @xmath315 .",
    "this is interesting for more than academic reasons as the light degrees of freedom ( dof ) in the b - meson have the same quantum numbers as the nucleon , isospin-@xmath316 and spin-@xmath316 . as such",
    ", the eft describing the interactions between two b - mesons has the same form as that describing the interactions between two nucleons , but the counterterms that enter into each eft are different .",
    "therefore , a deeper understanding of the eft description of nuclear physics can be gained by lattice qcd calculations of the potentials between b - mesons .",
    "a number of quenched explorations of these potentials have been performed previously  @xcite , but there was little evidence for any potential simply due to limited computational resources .",
    "we returned to this problem  @xcite and computed the potential between two b - mesons in the four possible spin - isospin channels ( neglecting @xmath317 mixing ) in relatively small volume dbw2 lattices with @xmath318 , with a pion mass of @xmath319 , and lattice - spacing of @xmath320 .",
