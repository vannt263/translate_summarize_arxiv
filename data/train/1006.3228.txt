    "other works in the field of graphene - superconductor heterostructures include studies on crossed andreev reflection in a graphene bipolar transistor  @xcite , on @xmath4- and @xmath5-wave sg junctions  @xcite and on ferromagnetic sg structures  @xcite .",
    "very recently , using a phase - sensitive squid interferometry technique chialvo et al .",
    "has studied experimentally the current - phase relation ( c@xmath6r ) of graphene josephson junctions  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we calculate the josephson current in sgs structure as a function of the superconductor phase difference , the temperature and the length of the junction . in our theoretical treatment",
    "we adapted the method used by brouwer and beenakker for metallic chaotic josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "the approach allows to obtain results for finite temperature and is valid for junctions of arbitrary length .",
    "we note that this method has already been applied for calculating the persistent current through a _",
    "n - p _ junction in graphene@xcite .",
    "wherever possible , we compare our results to previous ones derived for superconductor - normal conductor - superconductor ( sns ) junctions , where the normal conductor is a ballistic metal .    the rest of the paper is organized in the following way : in the next section we introduce the theoretical approach that we use to obtain the josephson current . in section  [ numerics ]",
    "we present and discuss the results of numerical calculations .",
    "finally , in section  [ summary ] we give a brief summary .",
    "we consider a josephson junction in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane . the normal graphene region ( g ) at @xmath9 separates the two superconducting regions formed by covering the graphene layer by two superconducting electrodes ( s ) in the regions @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( for the geometry see ref .  ) .",
    "the width of the josephson junction along the @xmath8 axis is @xmath12 . owing to the valley degeneracy of the hamiltonian , the full dirac - boguliubov  de gennes ( dbdg ) equations for graphene - superconductor systems decouple to two four by four , reduced hamiltonians that are related to each other by a unitary transformation ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",

    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are pauli matrices , @xmath18 is the unit matrix and , @xmath19 is the chemical potential and @xmath20 is the excitation energy .",
    "the superconductor electrodes are doped by the potential @xmath21 ( here @xmath22 and constant , and @xmath23 is the heaviside function ) .",
    "the wave function @xmath24 is comprised of electron @xmath25 and hole @xmath26 wave functions which have opposite spin and valley indices .",
    "for the pair potential @xmath27 we assume a simple model : its magnitude @xmath2 is constant in the s regions , changes step - function - like at the sg interfaces ( so called  rigid boundary condition  , see ref .  ) and is zero in the normal conducting region .",
    "similarly , we assume that the its phase is piecewise constant in the s regions .",
    "hence , the pair potential is given by @xmath28 for @xmath10 and @xmath29 for @xmath11 .",
    "band bending or other effects of the superconducting electrodes are neglected ( see e.g. ref .",
    "for the discussions of some of these effects in the case of normal conducting metal electrodes ) .",
    "the josephson current at finite temperature is given by@xcite @xmath30 , \\label{eq : josephson - curr}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the phase difference across the junction , @xmath32 is the density of states of the andreev levels .",
    "the factor of 4 accounts for the spin and valley degeneracy .",
    "as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : josephson - curr ] ) , a necessary step to calculate the josephson current is to obtain the density of states of andreev bound states in the sgs junction . to this end",
    "one can in principle proceed in the following way : one can write down a trial wave function in all three regions of the sgs structure .",
    "the boundary conditions at the two graphene - superconductor boundaries of the sgs junction then result in a secular equation @xmath33 whose solutions @xmath34 give the energies of the andreev bound states .",
    "for finite @xmath35 we obtained a @xmath36 determinant for the secular equation ( since this determinant is quite lengthy here we do not present its detailed form ) .",
    "once the energy levels @xmath34 of the sgs junction are known , the density of state is given by @xmath37 .",
    "however , the above outlined method is numerically quite cumbersome since one has to search for the zeros of the secular equation @xmath33 . to overcome this problem",
    "we now follow the method used by brouwer and beenakker in ref .  .",
    "they rewrote the expression for the josephson current given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : josephson - curr ] ) in a more convenient form .",
    "here we only summarize the main steps of the derivation .",
    "the secular equation can be written as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a function of @xmath40 but does not have zeros in the complex plane .",
    "thus it is easy to see that the density of states can be expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a positive infinitesimal . using the analytic properties of @xmath43 in the upper half of the complex @xmath40-plane and the fact that under the change @xmath44 the function @xmath43 goes over into its complex conjugate ( physically , this follows from the electron - hole symmetry )",
    ", the @xmath40-integration can be extended from @xmath45 to @xmath46 . finally , after performing a partial integration the josephson current in eq .",
    "( [ eq : josephson - curr ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath47 now closing the integration contour in the upper half of the complex @xmath40-plane and applying the residue theorem the josephson current becomes @xmath48 where @xmath49 are matsubara frequencies .",
    "note that in our model @xmath50 has no singularities for @xmath51 , thus the poles of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ josephson-2:eq ] ) come only from the hyperbolic tangent function .",
    "the main advantage of this result is that one does not need to obtain explicitly the solutions of the secular equation @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , this method immediately gives the finite temperature dependence of the josephson current . in the numerical calculations it turns out that the sum in eq .",
    "( [ josephson-3:eq ] ) is rapidly convergent and usually one need to include only a finite number of terms .",
    "a similar result has been found for the persistent current through a _",
    "n - p _ junction in graphene@xcite .",
    "we now consider the experimentally relevant case of highly doped superconductor electrodes , ie , the limit @xmath52 . by matching the wave functions at the graphene - superconductor boundaries of the sgs structure we found the same secular equation @xmath53 as that obtained by titov and beenakker using the transfer matrix method ( see eq .",
    "( 14 ) in ref .  ) .",
    "we used the ` infinite mass ' boundary conditions@xcite at @xmath54 and @xmath55 for which @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( for @xmath58 the choice of the boundary conditions is irrelevant ) . for",
    "a given @xmath59 the solutions of the quantization condition @xmath53 give the andreev energy levels @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "the secular equation @xmath53 is valid both in short and long junction limit@xcite .",
    "one can show that @xmath62 which is a necessary condition@xcite for writing the josephson current in the form of eq .",
    "( [ josephson-2:eq ] ) .",
    "the current contribution from each propagating mode with transverse momentum @xmath63 can be calculated separately and the total current is the sum over these contributions : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of propagating modes and the function @xmath66 determines the energy levels for a given transverse momentum @xmath67 .",
    "this equation is our starting point for calculating the supercurrent through a graphene based josephson junction .",
    "further analytical progress can be made in the short junction limit ( @xmath68 ) because the andreev levels @xmath60 can in that case be obtained in a closed form ( see eq .",
    "( 16 ) in ref .  ) .",
    "similarly , the summation over the matsubara frequencies in eq .",
    "( [ josephson-4:eq ] ) can be performed analytically using the identity @xmath69= ( \\pi \\tanh ( \\pi x/2)/(4 x)$ ] ( see ref .  ) and we find @xmath70 here @xmath60 and @xmath71 can be found in ref .  , while the temperature dependence of the superconductor gap @xmath72 for @xmath4-wave superconductors is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the zero order modified bessel function , @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the euler s constant@xcite . for zero temperature from ( [ eq : short_aram_alt ] ) one can arrive at the same expression for the josephson current as that obtained by titov and beenakker ( ref .  ) .",
    "for finite temperatures the summation over the transversal modes @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ josephson-4:eq ] ) can not be evaluated analytically but numerically can easily be treated .",
    "we now present the results of numerical calculations for the josephson current using the most general formula given by eq .",

    "one can make the following general observations : a ) the maximum current increases by increasing the doping ( @xmath94 value ) and by decreasing the temperature or the junction length ; b ) at higher temperatures the current shows a simple sinusoidal dependence on the phase in all of the cases while at low temperatures the position of the maxima of the currents are shifted to the right resulting in a skewness of the curves . following ref .",
    "we define the skewness by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the position of the maxima of the supercurrent .",
    "both the tendency to simple harmonic dependence for @xmath97 and a positive skewness ( i.e. @xmath98 ) are in line with previous calculations on josephson current in weak links which comprise a normal conducting metal or a tunnel barrier and assume that the pair potential changes abruptly at the normal - superconductor interface ( see e.g. ref .   for a review ) .",
