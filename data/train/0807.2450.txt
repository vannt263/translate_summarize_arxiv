    "more than a decade after their discovery , brown dwarfs continue to offer key insights into the astrophysics governing of some of the lowest temperature products of star formation .",
    "brown dwarfs in the field are particularly useful as probes of very cold atmospheres . for instance , the atmospheres of extrasolar planets are very difficult to study directly due to their intrinsic faintness and proximity to very bright stars .",
    "however , brown dwarfs are typically found in relative isolation , and their atmospheres are subject to the same processes ( e.g. , dust formation and sedimentation , and non - equilibrium molecular chemistry ) that are at work in their much less massive plantary counterparts .    despite the broad relevance of brown dwarfs , their fundamental properties remain poorly constrained by observations .",
    "in particular , very few direct mass measurements are available for brown dwarfs . to date",
    ", a total of six objects have been identified as unambiguously substellar via dynamical mass measurements with precisions ranging from 69% : both components of the t5.0+t5.5 binary 2mass  j15344984@xmath32952274ab @xcite , both components of the young m6.5+m6.5 eclipsing binary 2mass  j05352184@xmath30546085 in the orion nebula @xcite , and two tertiary components of hierarchical triples in which the primaries are m stars , gj  802b @xcite and gl  569bb @xcite .",
    "direct mass measurements of brown dwarfs are critical for empirically constraining substellar evolutionary models .",
    "since brown dwarfs have no sustainable source of internal energy , they follow a mass  luminosity  age relation , rather than the simpler mass  luminosity relation for main - sequence stars .",
    "thus , mass measurements alone can not fully constrain theoretical models , although mass and luminosity measurements of brown dwarfs in coeval binary systems can offer stringent tests of theoretical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . to fully constrain evolutionary models , systems with independent measurements of the mass , age , and  ( or one of the much less observationally accessible quanities  or @xmath4 )",
    "are required .",
    "such systems are quite rare , but they represent the gold standard among `` benchmark '' brown dwarfs .",
    "@xcite discovered the l  dwarf binary  in a hierarchical triple configuration with the young solar analog ( g2v ) using the curvature adaptive optics ( ao ) system hokupaa on the gemini north telescope on 2001 february 24 ut .",
    "the l  dwarfs are separated from each other by @xmath50@xmath613 , and they lie 2@xmath66 from the primary g star .  has been the target of ao - fed slit spectroscopy with nirspec on the keck ii telescope ( 1.151.35  ) and ircs on the subaru telescope ( 1.51.8  , 1.952.4  ) .",
    "@xcite used the latter spectra to determine the spectral types of the b and c components , both l4@xmath11 , via spectral template matching .",
    "these are consistent with the less precise nirspec @xmath7-band spectral types of dl2@xmath12 , which are on the @xcite system , found by @xcite for both hd  130948b and c.    we present here a dynamical mass measurement for  based on keck natural guide star adaptive optics ( ngs ao ) imaging of , as well as an analysis of _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and gemini archival images .",
    "in addition to an independent age estimate ( , see  [ sec : age ] ) , the primary star provides a wealth of information about the system .",
    "@xcite measured a solar metallicity for  ( [ m / h ]  =  0.00 , [ fe / h ]  =  0.05 ) , which is important since metallicity can play a significant role in shaping the spectra of brown dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most importantly , the distance to  has been measured very precisely by _ hipparcos _",
    ", with a revised parallax of 55.01@xmath10.24  mas @xcite , corresponding to a distance of @xmath8  =  18.18@xmath10.08  pc .",
    "thus , the distance is measured to an exquisite precision of 0.44% , which is invaluable since the error in the dynamical mass scales as 3@xmath2 the distance error ( i.e. , the 0.44% error in distance translates into a 1.3% error in mass ) .",
    "hd  130948bc can thus serve as both an `` age benchmark '' and `` mass benchmark '' system in studying brown dwarfs . in the literature ,",
    "the term benchmark is often applied to any readily observable unique or extreme objects , but here we specifically use the term to refer to systems for which fundamental properties may be directly determined .",
    "@xcite highlighted the value of systems where the age and composition of substellar objects can be independently determined , e.g. , from a stellar or white dwarf companion , and @xcite described an equivalent use of systems with dynamical mass measurements .",
    "essentially , since brown dwarfs follow a mass  luminosity  age relation , the measurement of either mass or age in addition to the measured luminosity allows any other quantity to be fully specified using evolutionary models .",
    "this approach can be extremely useful , for example , by offering precise determinations of  and , which can then be compared directly to atmospheric models .",
    "of course , the measurement of mass , age , _ and _ luminosity offers a direct test of evolutionary models , which is possible with .",
    "we retrieved _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) archival images of  obtained with the acs high resolution camera ( hrc ) coronagraph ( 1@xmath68 spot ) on 2002 september 6 and 2005 february 23 ut .",
    "these data were taken as part of engineering programs to test the stability of the psf of an occulted star between orbits ( eng / acs-10445 , pi cox ) and to measure the coronagraphic psf as a function of wavelength ( cal / acs-9668 , pi krist ) .",
    "fortunately , the scientifically interesting bright star  was selected to perform these tests . at both epochs ,",
    "is tight enough that the psfs of the two components are significantly blended with each other .",
    "therefore , to determine the relative astrometry we fit all six parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and flux for both components ) simultaneously with an iterative , @xmath11-minimum - finding approach .",
    "similar to our previous work @xcite , we used tinytim @xcite to model the off - spot psfs of the binary components and the ` amoeba ` algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for minimum finding in the six - dimensional parameter space .",
    "one challenge in obtaining precision astrometry for  is the removal of background light from the primary , which is only 2@xmath66 away .",
    "though most of the light from  is occulted by the 1@xmath68 coronagraph spot , the remaining light reaching the detector is highly structured and wavelength - dependent .",
    "the most effective technique for removal of the light from the occulted primary star is to use an image taken at the same epoch but at a different telescope roll angle .",
    "this way , the background due to the bright primary remains more or less unchanged while any other objects in the field move to a different part of the image . as part of the 2005 engineering tests ,",
    "images were taken at two different roll angles , so the background subtraction for these data is straightforward .",
    "however , all of the engineering data from 2002 were taken at the same roll angle , so data from a different epoch but the same filter must be used for the background subtraction . for the 2002 @xmath12 data , we were able to use the psf of  itself because the 2005 engineering data were taken in this filter .",
    "however , the remainder of the 2002 data were taken with the linear ramp filter @xmath13 , and  was never imaged in this filter on any other occasion .",
    "due to the wavelength dependence of the background , we must use an occulted star of similar spectral type to subtract the background .",
    "although very few @xmath13 coronagraph data are available in the archive , one star of identical spectral type , @xmath14  cen  a ( g2v ) , has been observed in @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14  cen ramp filter data were not taken at exactly the same nearly - monochromatic wavelengths as our science images , so we used the two @xmath14  cen images which bracketed our science data to create two different background - subtracted images of  in @xmath13 . though the resulting background subtractions were not very different , in the end , we only used the subtraction that yielded a lower @xmath11 in the psf - fitting of . when performing any background subtraction , the images were first optimally shifted and scaled to the nearest 1  pixel and 1% in normalization by minimizing the rms of the subtraction residual of the central 200@xmath2200-pixel region of the detector ( this region excludes ) .",
    "the final background - subtracted images of  are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "the lack of visible structure in the background demonstrates that the psf from  was adequately subtracted .    for psf - fitting of the background - subtracted images",
    ", tinytim psf models were generated to the specifications of the data .",
    "psfs were created for detector locations within the nearest pixel of ( this is important because of the field dependence of the geometric distortion that shapes the psf ) .",
    "we used the optical spectrum of the l4 dwarf 2mass  j0036 + 1821 from @xcite as the spectral template for psf generation .",
    "we included different amounts of telescope jitter ( 0 to 20 mas in 5 mas steps ) and telescope defocus ( @xmath320 to @xmath1520  in 4  steps ) to simulate the effect of `` breathing '' on the psf .",
    "we generated finely sampled psfs at 5@xmath2 the native pixel scale so that we could accurately interpolate them to a fraction of a pixel .",
    "we used the distortion solution of @xcite to correct the best - fit positions for the severe geometric distortion of the acs , and we used their measured acs pixel scale , which was derived by comparing commanded ( ` postarg ` ) offsets of _ hst _  in arcseconds to the resulting pixel offsets .",
    "they derived two such pixel scales for two epochs of observations of 47  tuc , and we adopt the mean and standard deviation of these two : 28.273@xmath10.006  mas / pix .    rather than simply use the scatter of individual measurements to estimate the astrometric uncertainty , we performed monte carlo simulations in order to quantify potential systematic errors in our psf - fitting routine . typically , the most important source of systematic error would be the imperfect modeling of the psf , but for  the imperfect subtraction of the background light due to  may also be significant .",
    "this is because the structured background light will change even within a single orbit due to thermal changes which affect the telescope optics ( e.g. , the well - known `` breathing '' phenomenon ) .",
    "also , the coronagraphic occulting spot must be stowed when not in use , and each time it is deployed it will be in a slightly different position , which will change the background slightly , but noticeably .",
    "it is easy to imagine how lumps in the residual background structure resulting from an imperfect subtraction could confuse measurement of both the astrometry and the flux ratio . in appendix  [ app :",
    "hst ] , we describe in detail our monte carlo simulations , from which we derived measurement offsets and uncertainties in our psf - fitting procedure for _ hst_/acs images .",
    "the offsets ranged in amplitude from 0.10.8  mas in separation , 0.10.7  in pa , and 0.010.05  mag in flux ratio .",
    "the offsets are comparable in size to the uncertainties predicted by the monte carlo simulations , which are also comparable in size to the rms scatter among the individual measurements .",
    "the simulations showed that systematic errors ( i.e. , imperfect psf - modeling ) dominate the predicted uncertainties . the best - fit positions and flux ratios from both epochs , with offsets applied and uncertainties adopted from the monte carlo simulations , are given in table  [ tbl : hst ] .      on 2007 january 26 ut , we began monitoring  using natural guide star adaptive optics ( ngs ao ) at the keck  ii telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the seeing conditions on that night were relatively poor ; however , at five subsequent epochs we obtained superior ngs ao imaging data .",
    "we used the facility ir camera nirc2 with its narrow field - of - view camera , which produces 10@xmath62@xmath210@xmath62 images .",
    "the primary star ( @xmath4  =  5.5  mag ; * ? ? ? * ) located 2@xmath66 away from  provided the reference for the ao correction .",
    "table  [ tbl : keck ] summarizes our keck ngs observations , and typical images are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] .    at each epoch ,  was imaged in one of the filters covering the standard atmospheric windows from the mauna kea observatories ( mko ) filter consortium @xcite .",
    "we initially obtained data in the @xmath16-band filter , though we subsequently took data in @xmath7- , @xmath17- , @xmath18- , and @xmath19-band ( @xmath20  =  2.271  , @xmath21  =  0.030  ) .    on each observing run , we obtained dithered images , offsetting the telescope by a few arcseconds between every 13 images",
    ". there was no need to exclude any of the images at any epoch on the basis of poor image quality .",
    "the images were reduced in a standard fashion .",
    "we constructed flat fields from the differences of images of the telescope dome interior with and without continuum lamp illumination .",
    "images were registered and stacked to form a final mosaic , though all the results described here were based on analysis of the individual images .    for the 2008 march and april epochs",
    ", we also obtained unsaturated images of the primary  interlaced with deep exposures in which it was saturated but  was measured at high @xmath22 .",
    "the minimum integration time of nirc2 is set by the sampling mode ( e.g. , single or correlated double sampling ) and how much of the array is read out , so by using a very restricted subarray we achieved exposures of 4.372  ms ( 512@xmath232 ) and 2.968  ms ( 384@xmath224 ) .",
    "we used the unsaturated images of the primary to estimate the strehl ratio and fwhm of images from the 2008 march and april epochs .",
    "since no field stars were available to obtain a simultaneous measurement of the strehl ratio and fwhm in images from other epochs , we used images of  itself .",
    "the fwhm was determined by a gaussian fit to the core of the psf of hd  130948b .",
    "the quantities needed to calculate the strehl ratio were obtained as follows : ( 1 ) the peak flux of the science psf was determined by a gaussian fit to the core of the psf of hd  130948b after removing contaminating flux from hd  130948c by subtracting the science image from itself after being rotated by 180  about hd  130948c ; ( 2 ) the total flux of hd  130948b was measured using aperture photometry of , then correcting for binarity using the measured flux ratio for that epoch and filter ; ( 3 ) the peak - to - total flux ratio of the theoretically perfect psf was determined using the publicly available idl routine ` nirc2strehl ` using the same aperture size as was used for the science image .",
    "we report the mean and standard deviation of the strehl ratio and fwhm measured for each set of dithered images at each epoch in table  [ tbl : keck ] .",
    "we computed the expected relative shift of the two components of  at each epoch due to differential chromatic refraction ( dcr ) . even though b and c have nearly identical spectral types based on resolved spectroscopy",
    ", small color differences can change the extent to which the atmosphere refracts their light , thus changing their relative position as a function of airmass .",
    "we used the prescription of @xcite for the effect of dcr , and we used the prescription of for the index of refraction of dry air as a function of wavelength .",
    "thus , given the effective wavelength of each component and details of the observations ( coordinates of , time observed , and observatory latitude ) , we calculated the expected shift due to dcr .",
    "we computed the effective wavelengths of b and c using template spectra of an l3 object ( 2mass  j1146 + 2230ab ; * ? ? ? * ) and an l5 object ( sdss  j0539 - 0059 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to represent the extremes of the possible spectral difference between the two components of  ( each is l4@xmath11 ) .",
    "the resulting effective wavelengths for @xmath16-band were 2.1976  and 2.1939  for l3 and l5 , respectively . even given this large allowance for spectral differences between the two components of , the dcr offset is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the error at any given epoch .",
    "( the largest estimated offset is 0.5@xmath23 for the 2008 april observations taken at airmass 1.6 . )",
    "therefore , we are justified in ignoring the effects of dcr in the relative astrometry .    to determine the relative positions and fluxes of",
    ", we used a simple analytic representation of the psf to deblend the two components .",
    "the model was the sum of three elliptical gaussians in which each gaussian component was allowed to have a different fwhm and normalization , but all components had the same ellipticity and semimajor axis pa . in the vicinity of",
    "there is a significant contribution of both sky background and light from the bright primary .",
    "therefore , we also simultaneously fitted a sloped , flat surface to account for the flux not due to .",
    "in all , we fitted simultaneously for 16 parameters : 6 parameters for the positions and fluxes of , 7 parameters for the three - component elliptical gaussian model , and 3 parameters for background light due to and the sky .",
    "the best - fit parameters were found by a levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization in which all pixels were weighted equally .",
    "our fitting procedure yielded a set of measurements of the projected separation , pa , and flux ratio for .",
    "we applied the distortion correction developed by b. cameron ( priv .",
    "comm . ) to the astrometry , which changed the results well below the 1@xmath23 level .",
    "the internal scatter of the measurements at each epoch was very small , but this does not include systematic errors due both to the imperfect modeling of the psf and to the temporally varying and spatially structured background light .",
    "to quantify these systematic errors , we conducted extensive monte carlo simulations designed to replicate the observations at each epoch .",
    "these simulations are described in detail in appendix  [ app : keck ] . by comparing the input to fitted parameters for 10@xmath24 simulated images",
    ", we determined the offset and uncertainty appropriate for each epoch .",
    "the offsets ranged in amplitude from 0.10.7  mas in separation , 0.030.20  in pa , and 0.0010.1  mag in flux ratio .",
    "we applied these offsets and although they could be up to 13@xmath23 , their application only changed the resulting total mass of  by only 0.2@xmath23 .",
    "it also improved the reduced @xmath11 of the best - fit orbit significantly , from a reduced @xmath11 of 1.8 to a reduced @xmath11 of 1.1 .",
    "the uncertainties predicted by the simulations were up to 3@xmath2 larger than the rms scatter among individual measurements at each epoch .",
    "for the 2008 march and april epochs , we used the interlaced unsaturated images of the primary  in a different approach for measuring the relative astrometry and flux ratio of .",
    "we extracted 40@xmath280-pixel cut - outs of  from the short exposures and  from the deeper exposures .",
    "we then stitched together these cut - outs , pairing an image of  with each of the images of  taken immediately before and after it .",
    "we employed the starfinder software package to iteratively solve for the psf , positions , and fluxes of the three components in these combined images .",
    "unfortunately , the keck ao system did not keep  sufficiently fixed on the nirc2 array ( it drifted up to @xmath2510  mas between deep exposures ) to enable the measurement of the positions of b and c relative to a from our data .",
    "since we used every available independent psf contemporaneous with the observations in measuring the system properties , we did not verify this empirical psf - fitting approach directly by testing starfinder on simulated binary images .",
    "however , at the 2008 april epoch , we obtained standard full - frame ( 1024@xmath21024 ) images , which we have analyzed and simulated in the same fashion as data from the previous epochs using our simple analytic model of the psf .",
    "the measured relative astrometry and flux ratio are consistent using both approaches .",
    "in fact , the separation measured using our simple analytic psf model , which is more likely to be affected by systematic errors , would be 3@xmath23 discrepant with the starfinder empirical psf results if the offset derived from simulated binary images was not applied .",
    "this suggests that our monte carlo simulations accurately predict measurement offsets for the analytic psf approach , and that the starfinder empirical psf - fitting approach does not harbor any significant systematic errors .    by interlacing short and deep exposures",

    "is the only system currently known for which such an empirical calibration of lithium burning is possible .",
    "substellar theoretical models are in sore need of empirical validation as they have been employed for more than a decade to interpret observations of field dwarfs . given the independent constraints on the age and composition provided by a stellar companion , dynamical mass measurements for triple systems like hd  130948abc provide the most challenging tests of substellar theoretical models .",
    "however , substellar companions to stars are quite rare ( @xmath01@xmath11% , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and even more rare are substellar binary companions that yield dynamical mass measurements in a reasonable time frame .",
    "when the stellar companion is a bright star like , a wealth of additional information is available , the most important of which is a very precise _ hipparcos _",
    "distance measurement since this is the limiting factor in the precision of the dynamical mass .",
    "stars bright enough to enable seismological measurements can yield the most stringent ( 1020% ) age determinations possible .",
    "thus ,  represents a rare class of benchmark systems for which the most precise mass and age determinations are possible .",
    "our observations of  indicate that substellar models currently harbor significant systematic errors .",
    "the potential underestimation of  by evolutionary models has far - reaching implications .",
    "for example , such models have been used to determine the low - mass end of the intial mass function and to predict the radii of extrasolar planets .",
    "obtaining measurements for more systems like  over a broad range of mass , luminosity , and age will be critical in understanding and resolving the discrepancies that have been revealed between observations and theoretical models .",

    "in order to robustly determine the systematic and random uncertainties in our psf - fitting measurements of  in the 2002 and 2005 _ hst_/acs coronagraph data , we fit an array of simulated binary images constructed from images of single stars .",
    "no suitable single stars were present in any archival coronagraph images taken in the same filters as  ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) . therefore , we turned to the much richer archive of @xmath114 coronagraph data , in which we found numerous suitable single stars .",
    "we selected three of the highest @xmath22 stars in the archive , all of which come from a 2003 march 25 ut observation of hd  163296 ( gto / acs-9295 , pi ford ) .",
    "these two @xmath02000 sec exposures were taken at two different roll angles , providing optimal subtraction of the background light due to the bright occulted star , and we used the second image ( 14:15  ut ) to subtract the background from the first ( 11:07  ut ) .",
    "the locations of the three stars we selected sample very different subpixel locations , which is a potential source of systematic error for the fitting of the slightly undersampled acs psf . in the end",
    ", we found that no matter which single star we used , the resulting astrometry did not change significantly , so all results we quote from our monte carlo simulations refer to the highest @xmath22 star .",
    "this star was scaled down by 3.35.7 mag to match the @xmath22 of the science data , depending on the epoch and bandpass .",
    "we created simulated binary images at the integer pixel separations that most closely approximated  at each epoch and telescope roll angle .",
    "subpixel - shifted binary images are impossible to accurately create from one image of a single star because the acs - hrc psf is slightly undersampled , inhibiting accurate interpolation to a fraction of a pixel . for the 2002 epoch",
    ", we used an equal number of simulated binaries with integer separations of @xmath115 and @xmath116 to approximate  which had a measured separation of @xmath117 . for the 2005 epoch",
    ", we used simulated binaries at integer pixel separations of @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "each corresponds to a different roll angle in the science data , for which the actual best - fit separations were @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we scaled down the simulated binary images to match the peak counts of the science data then added photon noise assuming a gain of 2.2  e@xmath122/dn ( from the ` atodgain ` header keyword ) .",
    "we used a flux ratio of 0.25  mag , consistent with the flux ratio measured in the 2005 @xmath12 data , when creating all simulated binary images . since  itself",
    "is always located in the exact part of the residual background in which we would like to inject our simulated binaries in any given image , we instead injected them at a location 180-symmetric to the location of .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the background light is visibly 180-symmetric even on scales as small as a few pixels .",
    "( note that this symmetry is not so perfect that rotated self - subtraction is preferred over roll subtraction for the removal of background light to the bright occulted star . ) to account for some uncertainty in the exact 180-symmetric point , we injected the simulated binary images at each location in a 3@xmath23 pixel box centered on our best guess of the 180-symmetric location .",
    "this also served to sample different realizations of the noise being added to the simulated binary images .",
    "we found that using a larger box size ( e.g. , 5@xmath25 ) did not significantly change the results .",
    "we then applied our psf - fitting routine in an identical manner to the simulated binary images as to the science data , with one exception .",
    "because the single star used to generate the simulated binary images is actually taken from an @xmath114 image , we used the appropriate @xmath114 tinytim models in the simulations . by comparing the input separations , position angles ( pas , measured in degrees east from north ) , and flux ratios of the simulated binaries to the fitted values",
    ", we determined the random error and any significant systematic offsets inherent in psf - fitting routine .",
    "we also investigated the effects of telescope defocus ( e.g. , due to breathing ) and jitter on our psf - fitting . in our analysis of _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 images of  @xcite , we found that allowing these as free parameters in the psf significantly improved the residuals , producing slightly improved astrometric precision .",
    "for the 2002 observations of , the best - fit defocus and jitter of the science data reached unrealistic values ( @xmath123  ; @xmath123  mas ) when allowed as a free parameter , thus we fixed telescope defocus and jitter to zero for both the science data and the simulations of the 2002 epoch . for the 2005 epoch , we found a degeneracy between telescope defocus and the measured binary separation , in the sense that tighter binaries could be equally well fit if the amplitude of the defocus was allowed to be rather large ( @xmath124  ) .",
    "this may be intuitively understood since defocus essentially increases the extent of the psf , so for a given binary footprint in a science image tighter separations can only be fit by increasing the defocus .",
    "the effect on the astrometry is indeed small ( 0.050.08  pix , 12  mas ) but significant . through the use of our monte carlo simulations , in which we know the true separation of our simulated binary images",
    ", we were able to break the degeneracy : allowing defocus as a free parameter artificially decreased the measured separation .",
    "only values of the defocus larger than are typically observed ( @xmath110  ) produced this degeneracy .",
    "therefore we fixed defocus and jitter to zero for both the science images and simulations of the 2005 epoch .",
    "first , we consider the results for the 2002 epoch , where the science data come from four different bandpasses : @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( 8626   ) , @xmath13 ( 9402   ) , and @xmath13 ( 10248   ) .",
    "the separation of  at this epoch is @xmath252@xmath2 larger than at the 2005 epoch , but the @xmath22 is lower ( see figure  [ fig : images ] ) , so it is not clear that the astrometric precision should be better .",
    "we found that the scatter among measurements taken in different bandpasses was consistent with the random error predicted by the simulations . in table",
    "[ tbl : hst ] , we quote the individual measurements taken in different bandpasses with their respective offsets applied and with uncertainties given from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the systematic offsets were small compared to the uncertainties ( 0.11.2@xmath23 ) .",
    "to understand how to combine these measurements , we investigated the nature of the uncertainties through simulations where the @xmath22 was varied over the equivalent of 0.07.5 mag of noise degradation . since the @xmath22 of the single star used to generate the simulated binaries is very high , this allows us to see what the error would be if the @xmath22 were much higher or lower than the science data .",
    "if the astrometric uncertainties were truly independent with respect to our psf - fitting routine , they should improve linearly with @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we found that at low @xmath22 the error in the 2002 epoch astrometry improved slightly less than linearly , which implies a significant systematic component to the error that can not be reduced by averaging over multiple measurements . at high @xmath22 ,",
    "the error was constant over a wide range of @xmath22 , implying a systematic noise floor .",
    "the @xmath22 of the science data is near the boundary between these two error regimes , thus the uncertainty of the science data is dominated by the systematic component , and we can not combine the individual measurements in different bandpasses assuming they are independent . therefore , for the 2002 epoch , we use the single bandpass with the smallest error in both separation and pa , @xmath13 ( 9402   ) , which is also the bandpass with the cleanest background subtraction , highest @xmath22 , and lowest @xmath11 from psf - fitting .    given the higher @xmath22 of the 2005 data , our simulations show that our astrometric uncertainty is better than for the 2002 epoch , even though the binary is much tighter in the 2005 data . all of the systematic offsets predicted by our simulations were smaller than the predicted random errors . in table  [ tbl : hst ] , we quote the individual measurements after applying all systematic offsets and give the uncertainties determined from our simulations . to understand how to combine these measurements , we investigated the nature of the errors through simulations where the @xmath22 was varied as described above for the 2002 epoch .",
    "we found that for all three 2005 measurements , the science data fall almost exactly between two regimes : ( 1 ) at high @xmath22 the errors improve slightly less than linearly implying both random and systematic errors are significant ; ( 2 ) at low @xmath22 the errors improve linearly implying this regime is dominated by random noise . if our science data were in the noise - dominated regime , we could hope to reduce the errors by @xmath125 by averaging the three measurements and adopting the standard error on the mean .",
    "however , since the data are in the high @xmath22 regime , no further reduction of the uncertainty is possible due to a significant contribution from non - independent systematic errors .",
    "therefore , we use the mean of the three 2005 _ hst _  measurements , with the typical ( median ) random error predicted by the monte carlo simulations as its uncertainty .",
    "for each epoch of keck observations , we conducted simulations to determine the systematic and random errors inherent to our psf - fitting routine .",
    "we created simulated binary images using the best available empirical keck ngs ao psf .",
    "the separation , pa , and flux ratio of each simulated binary were randomly drawn to be within 0.3 pixels , 3 , and 0.2 mag , respectively , of the measured values at that epoch .",
    "we used bilinear interpolation with cubic convolution to create a shifted but otherwise identical psf image .",
    "the original and shifted psfs were each scaled to match the typical peak fluxes of  at the given epoch . because the empirical psf image used to construct the simulated binary images was always of a higher @xmath22 than the science data , random noise was added to the simulated binary images assuming poisson statistics for the science data and infinite @xmath22 for the empirical input psf .",
    "the empirical input psfs for the 2007 january epoch simulations were images of the primary star  taken in @xmath19-band directly after obtaining @xmath16-band images of .",
    "the strehl ratio and fwhm of the images of  were 0.10@xmath10.02 and 65.2@xmath14.1 mas , respectively . in february 2007 , the next generation wavefront controller ( ngwfc )",
    "was installed on keck  ii @xcite .",
    "thus , for the remaining @xmath18- and @xmath19-band epochs , we used the ngwfc bright star @xmath16-band psfs ( @xmath126 , 12.6 , 13.6 mag ) available on the keck ngs ao webpage .",
    "we measured the strehl ratio and fwhm of this set of three psfs to be 0.51@xmath10.02 and 46.8@xmath10.9 mas .",
    "there is not a stark drop in strehl or fwhm with ngs brightness because the keck ngs ao system delivers similar on - axis image quality when the ngs is brighter than @xmath4  @xmath0  13  mag .",
    "this psf stability is also what enables our use of non - contemporaneous psfs , which is further justified by the fact that the systematic offsets derived from these empirical psfs improves the orbit fit ( see  [ sec : keck ] ) . finally , we used keck ngs images of the bright star gl  569a ( @xmath127 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) taken in @xmath128-band ( @xmath20  =  1.580  , @xmath21  =  0.023  ) on 2008 january 16 as the empirical input psf for the 2007 july epoch simulations . the strehl ratio and fwhm of these @xmath17-band psfs were 0.29@xmath10.04 and 37.9@xmath10.6 mas , respectively . in summary , while the fwhm of the single psfs we use in our simulations are comparable to the fwhm of the science images , the strehl ratios are consistently somewhat worse than the science data ( table  [ tbl : keck ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that the uncertainties from our monte carlo simulations of the keck astrometry may be slightly overestimated ( this is consistent with our best fit orbit , which has reduced @xmath129 )",
    ".    background light due to the primary star  was added to the simulated binary images in order to accurately replicate our science images . to accomplish this",
    ", we utilized the 60-symmetric nature of the hexagonal keck psf .",
    "we extracted subregions from each dithered image at 60-symmetric locations relative to the location of .",
    "though the central pixels of  are saturated in these images , its location can be deduced ( typically to better than @xmath01 pixel ) from the intersection of the 6 diffraction spikes .",
    "the extracted subregions were appropriately rotated to match the background at the location of .",
    "this yielded a number of independent images of the background up to five times the number of dithered images at a given epoch .",
    "some of the symmetric locations fell off the array , but there was always at least one symmetric location available for each dithered image . for each epoch , 10@xmath24 simulated science images were constructed by random pairing of the extracted background images with the simulated binary images described above .",
    "the hexagonal keck airy pattern is clearly visible in all science images , so care was taken to appropriately rotate the empirical input psfs to match the rotation in the science images .",
    "this is important because the overlap of the first hexagonal airy ring of one component with the core of the other is likely one of the major sources of systematic error in our psf - fitting technique .",
    "the image rotator of the keck ao system changes to keep the pa of the sky fixed with respect to nirc2 during a set of observations .",
    "thus , the telescope optics and resulting airy pattern rotate with respect to nirc2 , and these angles were measured directly from the header of each science image .",
    "for instance , the 2007 march 25 observations were conducted over @xmath08 minutes near transit , when the rotator is changing fastest , so the psf rotated by @xmath07  with respect to the sky during that time .     or the @xmath13 ramp filter , which produces nearly - monochromatic images , and we have labeled the images with the wavelength ( ` lrfwave ` header keyword ) .",
    "we do not rotate the _ hst _  data so that north is up in order to preserve the somewhat undersampled nature of the data .",
    "note that severe geometric distortion makes the cardinal directions in acs - hrc images non - orthogonal . in the keck images ,",
