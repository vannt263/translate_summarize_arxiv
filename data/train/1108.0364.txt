    "when a porous medium is plunged in an infinite fluid reservoir , the solid matrix absorbs fluid until an equilibrium state is reached . many interesting features of this swelling phenomenon have been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "the amount of swelled fluid can be controlled via different external parameters such as the fluid pressure in the reservoir  @xcite , that is via its chemical potential , the fluid velocity @xcite , or a mechanical pressure exerted on the solid @xcite .",
    "the solid  fluid segregation in consolidation is seen when , depending on the external pressure acting on the porous material , phases differing in fluid content are observed .",
    "this problem has been addressed@xcite by the authors in the framework of continuum mechanics adopting in particular a first gradient model ; the existence of two different phases depending on the external pressure has been proved . in that context the interesting question of the coexistence of the two phases could not be posed for the first gradient nature of the model . in this paper",
    "we propose a more general two field one dimensional second gradient model to study the profiles connecting two coexisting phases and the formation of critical droplets , if any , of one phase into the other .",
    "the adopted approach in modeling the behavior of porous continua is essentially based on a pure solid lagrangian description of motion , referring kinematics to the reference configuration of the porous skeleton ( see section  [ s : setup ] ) .",
    "the constitutive model is purely phenomenological , which means that the overall potential energy , regarded as a function of the strain of the skeleton and the fluid mass density ( per unit volume , in the solid reference configuration ) , is built up in such a way to describe the existence of two states of equilibrium : the solid  rich and the fluid  rich phase .",
    "thus no refined description of solid grain connectivity , as well as connection among regions with different porosity is available in such a model .",
    "conversely the constitutive state parameters are selected so as to describe the showing up of the fluid  rich phase , which is possibly associated to the occurrence of fluid segregation .",

    "@xmath24 is the _ overall potential energy density _",
    "accounting for both the internal and the external forces . in  ( [ lag ] ) we have denoted with the dot the derivative taken w.r.t .",
    "time and with the prime the derivative w.r.t .  the solid reference space variable .",
    "the equation of motion for the two fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be derived assuming that the possible motions of the system in an interval of time @xmath27 are those such that the fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 are extremals for the _ action functional _ @xmath28 in correspondence of the independent variations of the two fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 on @xmath29 . in other words",
    "any possible motion of the system in the considered interval is a solution of the euler ",
    "lagrange equations associated to the variational principle @xmath30 .",
    "if one is interested to find equilibrium profiles @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the system , namely , the solutions of the equations of motion independent of time , since the kinetic energy associated to those profiles is equal to zero , the lagrangian density reduces to minus the potential energy density . in this case",
    "the action is given by ( [ azione ] ) where the time integral gives a not essential multiplicative constant , and the variational principle associated to such an action gives the seeked for equilibrium profiles .",
    "assume , now , that the effect of the internal forces exchanged by the solid and fluid particles and that of the conservative external fields can be described via a potential energy density @xmath33 depending on the kinematic fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 only through the strain and the fluid mass density fields . note that the strain depends only on @xmath25 and the fluid mass density only on @xmath26 , hence the independent variations of those primitive fields reflect on independent variations of @xmath34 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus , limiting the study to boundary value problems expressed in terms of the fields @xmath34 and @xmath20 , we can treat the fields @xmath34 and @xmath20 as primitive , consider their independent variations and look for the equilibrium profiles @xmath35 and @xmath36 starting from the variational principle @xmath37 finally , we can derive , starting from ( [ variazionale03 ] ) , the equations governing the equilibrium profiles @xmath34 and @xmath20 . by computing the variation of the action functional on @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , we get the euler  lagrange equations @xmath40 with boundary conditions ensuring that @xmath41_{\\ell_1}^{\\ell_2 } = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the variations of the strain and fluid mass density fields . for instance",
    "dirichelet boundary conditions would do the job , since we would have @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "but for potential energy densities @xmath24 at least quadratic in the derivatives @xmath46 and @xmath47 even neumann boundary conditions would be acceptable . in the sequel we shall refer to any solution of the euler  lagrange equations ( [ moto06 ] ) with suitable boundary conditions as an _ equilibrium profile _ of the system corresponding to the chosen boundary conditions .",
    "the model ( [ variazionale03 ] ) is called a _ first gradient _ model",
    "if the potential energy density @xmath24 does not depend on the first derivatives of the strain and of the liquid density , otherwise the model is said a _",
    "second gradient _ model .",
    "this way of classifying the models is related to the fact that both @xmath34 and @xmath20 depends , by definition , on the gradient of the primitive kinetic fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "second gradient theories are suitable to be developed for modeling stress / strain concentration due , for instance , to the presence of geometrical singularities ( crack propagation in fracture mechanics@xcite ) or phase transitions as in the case of wetting@xcite .",
    "in particular second gradient poromechanics has been recently formulated  @xcite extending the standard arguments of the biot theory  @xcite .",
    "such a model addresses the description of those deformation phenomena which occur at the same length scale as that where high gradients in deformation can be detected .",
    "classical poromechanics@xcite is not able to describe these phenomena : the macroscopic model is regarded in that case as the average of a microscopic one where a kind of stationarity assumption@xcite ( spatial ergodicity ) on the random field which characterizes the microscopic mechanical properties of the material has been formulated .",
    "this allows for replacing ensemble averages with volume averages insofar as the characteristic size of the heterogeneities is much smaller than the typical length scale of the reference volume element ( rve ) .",
    "if this is no more the case , the classical assumptions of uniform strain ( stress ) or periodic boundary conditions , for every reference volume , are no more valid , but , conversely , macroscopic strain gradient plays a crucial role in specifying the state of stress / strain inside the rve itself .",
    "the goal , here , is to formulate a second gradient poromechanical model for describing the transition from the standard biot  like equilibrium , associated to a compacted solid , versus the fluid ",
    "segregated phase describing duct thinnering in the matrix and , consequently , fluid mass concentration in the pores .",
    "thus , we consider a model with total potential energy density in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a polynomial quadratic function of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath50 is a differentiable function positively diverging along any radial direction in the plane @xmath34@xmath20 , having at least a local minimum , and whose stationary points are isolated . since @xmath49 is quadratic , we have that a constant solution of the euler  lagrange problem ( [ moto06 ] ) must necessarily satisfy the equations @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; in other words a constant profile must be constantly equal to an extremal point of the first gradient part @xmath50 of the total potential energy .",
    "we then let a _",
    "phase _ of the model to be a constant equilibrium profile equal to one of the local minima of the function @xmath50 .",
    "note that the euler  lagrange problem ( [ moto06 ] ) and ( [ moto07 ] ) for the first gradient model associated to ( [ modello ] ) , namely the one obtained for @xmath53 , is the system of algebraic equations @xmath52 and @xmath51 .",
    "since the stationary points of the two variable function @xmath50 are isolated , we have that the equilibrium profiles for such a model are necessarily constant functions of @xmath54 equal to the values of the stationary points of @xmath50 .",
    "hence , in the case of a first gradient model it is not possible to discuss phase coexistence , since there exist only continuous constant equilibrium profiles . on the other hand , in second gradient models ,",
    "different ( not constant ) equilibrium profiles can exist .",
    "this fact allows us to pose the problem of the coexistence of two existing phases .",
    "suppose that the model exhibits the two phases @xmath55 and @xmath56 ; a _ connection _",
    "@xcite between those phases is an equilibrium profile @xmath57 of the action functional on @xmath58 satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "we say that the two considered phases _ coexist _ if and only if a connection does exist .",
    "we study , now , a particular poroelastic model and in that framework we discuss the existence of the consolidation phase transition and prove the coexistence of the two phases for a particular value of the external pressure .",

    "we have also shown that at different values of the pressure the two phases can not coexist . for a particular choice of the parameters of the model it is possible to reduce the problem of finding the coexistence profile to the computation of a definite integral .",
    "we have studied the coexistence profile for different values of the physical parameters of the model and shown that non  monotonic interfaces exist .",

    "accounting in particular for the qualitative of @xmath118 , which tends to @xmath223 when @xmath79 is increased , we shall study the asymptotic behavior of @xmath224 for @xmath101 and that of @xmath118 which is the solution of the equation @xmath225 when @xmath130 .",

    "compared to the standard variational calculus , see for instance the paragraph  8.2 in evan s classical book@xcite , the authors have to face the lack of compactess due to the infinite domain @xmath147 on which the solution of the variational problem is defined .",
    "this problem is overcame by using suitable costraints that are successivley removed .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the theorem  3.7 the authors state that the connection is a minimizer of the action functional @xmath258 .",
