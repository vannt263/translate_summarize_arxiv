    "clusters of galaxies and the filaments that connect them are the largest structures in the present universe in which the gravitational force due to the matter overdensity overcomes the expansion of the universe .",
    "massive clusters have typical total masses of the order of @xmath0 , mostly in the form of dark matter ( @xmath1 of the total mass ) , while baryonic matter is in the form of galaxies ( @xmath2 ) and especially in the form of a hot ( @xmath3 ) and tenuous ( @xmath4 ) gas ( @xmath5 ) , the intra - cluster - medium ( icm)@xcite ( figure 1 ) . that icm emits thermal x - rays , mostly via bremsstrahlung radiation , and also compton - scatters the photons of the cosmic microwave background , leaving an imprint in the mm - wavelengths band that provides information complementary to the x - rays@xcite ( figure 1 ) . in the current paradigm of structure formation",
    ", clusters are thought to form via a hierarchical sequence of mergers and accretion of smaller systems driven by dark matter that dominates the gravitational field .",
    "mergers , the most energetic phenomena since the big bang , dissipate up to @xmath6ergs during one cluster crossing time ( @xmath7 gyr ) .",
    "this energy is dissipated primarily at shocks into heating of the gas to high temperature , but also through large - scale icm motions@xcite .",
    "galaxy clusters are therefore veritable crossroads of cosmology and astrophysics ; on one hand they probe the physics that governs the dynamics of the large - scale structure in the universe , while on the other hand they are laboratories to study the processes of dissipation of the gravitational energy at smaller scales .",
    "in particular , a fraction of the energy that is dissipated during the hierarchical sequence of matter accretion can be channeled into non - thermal plasma components , i.e. , relativistic particles ( cosmic rays , or `` crs '' ) and magnetic fields in the icm . relativistic particles in the icm are the main subject of our review .",
    "the evidence for non - thermal particles in the icm is routinely obtained from a variety of radio observations that detect diffuse synchrotron radiation from the icm ( figure 1 ) .",
    "they also open fundamental questions of their origins as well as their impact on both the physics of the icm and the evolution of galaxy clusters more broadly@xcite .",
    "cosmological shock waves and turbulence driven in the icm during the process of hierarchical cluster formation are obvious potential accelerators of cosmic ray electrons ( cre ) and protons ( hadrons or crp ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , clusters host other accelerators of crs , ranging from ordinary galaxies ( especially as a byproduct of star formation ) to active galaxies ( agn ) @xcite and , potentially , regions of magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "the long lifetimes of crp ( and/or nuclei ) against energy losses in the icm and their likely slow diffusive propagation through the disordered icm magnetic field , together with the large size of galaxy clusters , make clusters efficient storehouses for the hadronic component of crs produced within their volume or within the individual subunits that later merged to make each cluster @xcite .",
    "the consequent accumulation of crs inside clusters occurs over cosmological times , with the potential implication that a non - negligible amount of the icm energy could be in the form of relativistic , non - thermal particles .",
    "an important result of trapped crp above a few hundred mev kinetic energy is that they will necessarily produce secondary pions ( and their decay products , including e@xmath8 and @xmath9-rays ) through inelastic collisions with thermal target - protons .",
    "consequently , they can be traced and/or constrained by secondary - particle - generated radio and @xmath9-ray emission@xcite .",
    "the most direct way to pin - point crp in galaxy clusters is through the detection of @xmath9-ray emission generated by the decay of secondary @xmath10 particles .",
    "however to date , despite the advent of the orbiting fermi - lat and deep observations from ground - based cherenkov arrays , no icm has been firmly detected in the @xmath9-rays@xcite . cluster @xmath9-ray",
    "upper limits , together with several constraints from complementary approaches based on radio observations @xcite suggest that the energy in the form of crp is less than roughly a percent of the thermal energy of the icm , at least if we consider the central mpc ",
    "size region .",
    "this result contradicts several optimistic expectations derived in the last decades , based mostly on estimates for crp production in structure formation shocks , and poses important constraints on the efficiency of crp acceleration and transport in galaxy clusters .    on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of cre and magnetic fields in the icm of many clusters is in fact demonstrated by radio observations .",
    "cre are indeed very well traced to the icm of clusters through their radio emission .",
    "cluster - scale ( @xmath7 mpc - scale ) diffuse synchrotron emission is frequently found in merging galaxy clusters .",
    "it appears in the form of so - called _ giant radio halos _ , apparently unpolarized synchrotron emission associated with the cluster x - ray emitting regions , and _ giant radio relics _",
    ", elongated and often highly polarized synchrotron sources typically seen in the clusters peripheral regions with linear extents sometimes exceeding @xmath7 mpc@xcite .",
    "the locations , polarisation and morphological properties of radio relics suggest a connection with large scale shocks that cross the icm during mergers and that may accelerate locally injected electrons or re - accelerate pre - existing energetic electrons to energies where they emit observable synchrotron emission@xcite .",
    "electrons responsible for giant radio halo emissions , on the other hand , require virtually cluster - wide generation , as we outline below .",
    "there are good reasons to believe that radio halos trace gigantic turbulent regions in the icm , where relativistic electrons can be re - accelerated through scattering with mhd turbulence and/or injected by way of inelastic collisions between trapped crp and thermal protons @xcite .",
    "as we will discuss in this review , one of the most interesting consequences of the present theoretical scenario for cre production in clusters is that cluster - scale radio emission should be more common than presently seen , especially at lower radio frequencies .",
    "specifically , we may expect to find many more clusters through radio emission in the frequency range that will be explored in the next few years by the new generation of low frequency radio telescopes , such as lofar , mwa and lwa .",
    "another important consequence of current icm cr models is that , despite a current dearth of detections , clusters should be sources of high energy photons at a level that could be detectable by the next generation of x - ray and @xmath9-ray telescopes .",
    "successful , firm detection of galaxy clusters in the hard x - rays and in @xmath9-rays would lead to a fundamental leap forward in our understanding , as it will provide a unique way to measure the energy content of magnetic fields , as well as cre and crp in cosmic large scale structure .",
    "since it seems likely that radio halos and relics are signposts of the dissipation of gravitational energy into non - thermal components and emission , they can also be used as valuable ( indirect ) probes of the merging rate of clusters at different cosmic epochs @xcite . in this respect",
    "the upcoming radio surveys both at lower and higher radio frequencies , with lofar , mwa , and askap , and on longer time - scales with the ska , have the potential to provide important complementary data for cosmological studies .",
    "diffuse synchrotron radio emission on smaller scales , @xmath11 kpc , known as _ radio mini - halos _ , is also found at the centers of relatively relaxed clusters with cool cores @xcite .",
    "the existence of mini halos indicates that mechanisms other than major cluster - cluster mergers can power non - thermal emission in the icm . as we will discuss in this review ,",
    "also in this case , gravity is likely to provide the ultimate energy reservoir to power the non - thermal emission , potentially extracted , for example , from the sloshing of the gas in response to motions of dark matter cores in and near the cluster .",
    "however , agns that are usually found at the center of these sources and also frequently distributed over larger cluster volumes may be players .",
    "in addition , at the present time any relationships between mini and giant halos are still poorly defined .",
    "starting from this background , the goals of this review are to discuss the most relevant aspects of the origin and physics of crs and non - thermal emission in galaxy clusters and to elaborate on the present theoretical framework .",
    "we will place emphasis on the most important current observational constraints , along with the observational prospects for the near future . in sect.2",
    "we will discuss the physics of crs acceleration by different sources / mechanisms , whereas in sect.3 we will discuss the relevant energy losses and the dynamics of crs in the icm .",
    "in sect.4 we will discuss the most important observational properties of diffuse radio sources in galaxy clusters , their origin and the main prospects for the near future .",
    "specifically giant radio halos , mini halos and relics are discussed in sects .",
    "4.2 , 4.3 , and 4.4 , respectively , whereas in sect .",
    "4.1 we will briefly discuss current observational constraints on the magnetic field in the icm . in sect .",
    "5 we will discuss current observational constraints on the high - energy emission from galaxy clusters , the most relevant theoretical aspects and prospects for the near future .",
    "6 provides our summary .",
    "consensus has been reached in the past decade that shocks produced during the hierarchical formation of the large scale structure in the universe are likely sources of crs in galaxy clusters@xcite , thus implying a direct connection between the generation of crs and the formation and evolution of the hosting clusters . similarly , there is consensus on the fact that turbulence can be induced in the icm as a result of the same processes of clusters formation and that such turbulence affects the propagation of crs , while also providing a potentially important mechanism for re - acceleration of crp and cre @xcite .",
    "several additional sources can supply ( inject ) relativistic particle populations ( electrons , hadrons or both ) into the icm .",
    "for instance , particles can be accelerated in ordinary galaxies as an outcome of supernovae ( sn ) and then expelled into the icm with a crp luminosity as high as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , high velocity outflows from agns may plausibly contribute up to @xmath13 in crs over periods of @xmath14 years @xcite .",
    "individual normal galaxies are certainly sources of crs as a consequent of current and past star formation . massive clusters of galaxies contain more than a hundred galaxies where sn and pulsars accelerate crs .",
    "the efficiency of cr acceleration at these sites is constrained from complementary observations of galactic sources .",
    "however , the amount of cr energy available to the icm depends also on the way these crs are transported from their galactic sources into the icm .",
    "voelk et al .",
    "1996 @xcite pioneered the studies of the role of sn explosions , including starbursts , in cluster galaxies .",
    "the number of sne experienced by a typical cluster since its formation epoch , @xmath15 , can be estimated from the metal enrichment of the icm , assuming those metals are released by sne .",
    "this gives a total energy budget in the form of crp :    @xmath16_{\\odot } x_{cl } m_{cl , gas}}\\over { \\delta m_{fe } } } e_{sn } \\eta_{cr}^{sn } \\label{voelk}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17_{\\odot } x_{cl } m_{cl , gas}$ ] is the mass of iron in the icm ( @xmath17_{\\odot } \\sim 4/10 ^ 5 $ ] is the iron abundance , @xmath18 the typical metallicity measured in galaxy clusters , and @xmath19 the baryon mass of the cluster ) , @xmath20 is the iron mass available to the icm from a single sn explosion , @xmath21erg is the sn kinetic energy and @xmath22 is the fraction of sn kinetic energy in the form of crp ; @xmath23 is constrained from observations of sn in the galaxy .",
    "note that the efficiency for acceleration of cre in snrs is apparently several orders of magnitude smaller than for crp @xcite .",
    "eq.[voelk ] implies a ratio between the crp and thermal energy budget in galaxy clusters @xmath24 , assuming @xmath25 ( appropriate for type ii sn ) and @xmath26k .",
    "this is an optimistic estimate of the expected energy content of crp in galaxy clusters from this source , because it does not account for adiabatic losses in the likely event that crp from sn are transported into the icm by sn - driven galactic winds .    on the other hand ,",
    "clusters of galaxies contain agns , which , by way of their synchrotron - emitting jets and radio lobes , are known to carry cre @xcite .",
    "the majority of cool - core clusters contain central , dominant galaxies that are radio loud@xcite .",
    "the radio lobes of these agns are seen frequently to coincide with x - ray dark volumes ( `` cavities '' ) that have turned out to be the best calorimeters of the total energy deposited by agn outflows .",
    "the cavities , being filled with relativistic and some amount of very hot thermal plasma at substantially lower density than their surroundings , are poor thermal x - ray emitters .",
    "such cavities have been seen in something like @xmath27 of the clusters observed by chandra @xcite , despite the fact that they often exhibit low contrast . from an assumption of pressure balance between the cavity and the surrounding icm the cavity energy contents",
    "have been estimated generally in the range @xmath28erg @xcite .",
    "these approach @xmath29%@xmath30 for an entire icm in some cases .",
    "dynamical estimates of cavity lifetimes are typically @xmath31yr , roughly representing buoyancy timescales .",
    "these lead to agn power deposition estimates within an order of magnitude of the x - ray cooling rate of the host cluster @xcite , at least while the agn jets are active .",
    "the bubble forming duty cycles , estimated from the fraction of cool - core clusters that harbor clear bubbles , range as high as 70% @xcite .",
    "simulations suggest that roughly @xmath32 of the power of the agn outflow is immediately deposited irreversibly as icm heat through shocks and entrainment@xcite .",
    "these may also drive icm turbulence that would contribute to cr acceleration and to the dynamics of crs ( sects .",
    "2.2.2 , 3.2 ) .",
    "given their large energy inputs , agn outflows are widely invoked to account for heating needed to limit the effects of strong radiative cooling in cluster cores , e.g.@xcite .",
    "so , the total energy deposition into the icm by agns is likely to be substantial .",
    "however , the energy in cre and crp is harder to establish in radio lobes of cluster radio galaxies . in a few cases",
    "the absence of observed inverse compton x - rays has been used to establish that most of the energy filling the radio lobes must be in some form other than radiating electrons @xcite , although cre energy fractions as high as 10% are not ruled out .",
    "meaningful crp energy content estimates in the lobes do not exist at present , although recent detailed comparisons of internal - lobe and external pressure suggest that models in which crp transported by the jet dominate lobe energetics are unlikely@xcite .",
    "remarkably , various theoretical arguments have been made suggesting that much of the direct energy flux in agn jets is carried by cold , non - radiating particles or electromagnetic fields @xcite . even if much of the energy filling the cavities is carried by crs",
    ", it is not yet clear how efficiently those crs can be dispersed through diffusion and convective / turbulent mixing over the full cluster volume , and how much of the energy would remain in crs , after accounting for adiabatic and other energy losses .",
    "large scale magnetic fields , for instance , can help confine lobe contents @xcite .",
    "a connected problem that will be discussed in sect.4.3 is the possible role of relativistic outflows from the central agns in the origin of radio mini halos in cool core clusters .",
    "while most discussions of agn energy deposition in clusters have focused on central , dominant galaxies , there are other populations of agns in clusters that could contribute to the cr population , either directly or indirectly .",
    "low luminosity agns are quite commonly distributed throughout clusters .",
    "stocke et al.@xcite have argued , in fact , that virtually all bright red sequence galaxies in rich clusters are likely to be low - luminosity blazars with relativistic jets that could collectively dominate agn energy inputs to the icm . in that case",
    "their cr outputs would be more easily distributed across the cluster by way of icm turbulence and large scale `` weather '' ( e.g. , sloshing ) .",
    "in addition , tailed radio galaxies , quite common and widely distributed in both relaxed and merging clusters , show clear evidence of strong interactions with the icm that includes entrainment and the generation of turbulence@xcite .     from simulations presented in @xcite.,width=491 ]      the current prevailing view is that the process of structure formation may contribute directly and indirectly most of the energetics of non - thermal components ( crs , magnetic fields and turbulence ) in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "mergers between two or more clusters are observed to heat clusters through shocks @xcite .",
    "although more difficult to constrain observationally , the additional process of semi - continuous accretion of material onto clusters , especially from colder filaments , is expected to drive quasi - stationary , strong shocks and turbulent flows at mpc distances from cluster centers that should impact on the icm physics and acceleration of crs over wide volumes .",
    "particle acceleration during mergers should occur at shock waves that are driven to cross the icm .",
    "particle acceleration is also expected to result from several mechanisms that may operate within turbulent regions also driven in the icm during these mergers ( e.g. , turbulent acceleration and magnetic reconnection , etc)@xcite . the intricate pattern of shocks and large - scale turbulent motions and their interplay is still difficult to establish observationally , but can be traced in some detail by cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation .",
    "fig.2 provides a view of the complex dynamics of the icm as seen in simulations .",
    "in particular , a complex pattern of strong and weak shocks is naturally driven in the icm , largely by gravity variations reflecting dark matter dynamics ( sect .",
    "this shock distribution , where most of the kinetic energy flux is dissipated within clusters , is morphologically correlated to some extent with the distribution of the turbulent motions in the icm , that are , indeed , partly driven by those shocks ( sect .",
    "in the following we will focus on the physics of shocks and particle acceleration at shocks ( sect .",
    "2.2.1 ) , and on the physics of turbulence and turbulent acceleration in galaxy clusters ( sect .",

    "shocks are divided into internal and external categories .",
    "external shocks are defined as shocks forming when never - shocked , low - density , gas accreted onto nonlinear structures , such as filaments etc .",
    "internal shocks form within the regions bounded by external shocks .",
    ", width=491 ]      the total gravitational energy dissipated by baryonic matter in a merger of two clusters with roughly equal mass , @xmath36 , is @xmath37 erg . with the assumption that the gaseous components of the initial clusters are at the associated virial temperatures , it is easy to show that the merging components approach each other at slightly supersonic relative speed , therefore implying the formation of weak , @xmath38 , shock waves @xcite .",
    "those shocks will typically strengthen moderately as they emerge into lower density and low temperature regions outside the cluster cores .",
    "additional , remote , accretion shocks that result from the continuous accretion of matter at several mpc - distances from clusters center ( also called `` external shocks '' when they form due to the accretion of never - shocked gas ) , are typically much stronger ; that is , they have higher mach numbers , since they develop in cold , un - virialised external cluster regions . on the other hand ,",
    "since gas densities are also quite low in those environments , the energy available for dissipation through such shocks is relatively smaller than through lower mach number shocks that dissipate energy in higher density regions closer to cluster centers during mergers .",
    "simple ( analytical or semi - analytical ) but accurate estimates of the amount of kinetic energy associated with accretion / external shocks are very challenging . a leap forward in understanding in this area ,",
    "however , has been achieved in the last decade through extensive cosmological simulations that allow one to study the formation of shocks in clusters , from their outskirts to more internal regions with increasing detail@xcite .",
    "figure 3 illustrates these points .",
    "it shows the kinetic energy flux through shock surfaces , that is , @xmath39 , measured in clusters formed during cosmological simulations . here , @xmath40 is the upstream gas density , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are shock velocity and surface area , respectively .",
    "the distribution of energy fluxes shows that most of the gravitational energy is dissipated at relatively weak , `` internal '' ( merger ) shocks , with mach number @xmath43 . a modest fraction of the kinetic energy - flux passes through related stronger internal - shocks developed during merger activity as they propagate outwards after merging cores have their closest approach .",
    "figure 3 shows that only a few % of the energy flux is dissipated at strong , `` external '' shocks .",
    "if even a small percentage of the merger and accretion shock - dissipated energy can be converted into non - thermal particles through a first order fermi process , then the icm could be populated with an energetically significant population of non - thermal , cr particles @xcite .",
    "this prospect has drawn considerable focus to potential consequences of shock generated crs and the refinement of early estimates of cr production in icms .    _",
    "shock acceleration of crs _    the acceleration of crs at shocks is customarily described according to the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) theory @xcite . in effect diffusing particles are temporarily trapped in a converging flow across the shock if their scattering lengths across the shock are finite but much greater than the shock thickness .",
    "particles escape eventually by convection downstream . until they do , they gain energy each time they are reflected upstream across the shock , with a rate determined by the velocity change they encounter across the shock discontinuity and a competition between convection and diffusion on both sides of the shock . the hardness ( flatness ) of the resulting spectrum reflects the balance between energy gain and escape rates .",
    "in other words , it depends on the energy gain in each shock crossing combined with the probability that particles remain trapped long enough to reach high energies .",
    "mathematically this balance can be conveniently described through the diffusion - convection equation for a pitch angle averaged crs distribution function @xmath44 in a compressible flow is the number of crs per unit phase - space volume , @xmath45 that is @xcite :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the modulus of the particle s momentum , @xmath48 is the velocity of the background medium ( assuming @xmath49 , with @xmath50 the alfvn velocity ) , while @xmath51 is the unit vector parallel to the local magnetic field , and @xmath52 is the particle spatial diffusion coefficient ( see sect .",
    "the 2nd and 3rd terms account for convection and diffusion , respectively , while the right hand side takes account of the adiabatic energy gains ( losses ) suffered by particles in a converging ( expanding ) flow .",

    "2.2.2 ) .        under these conditions ,",
    "if all particles are injected at low energies and `` see '' the same velocity change across the shock , the steady state spectrum of test - particle crs at a plane shock is a power law in momentum , @xmath53 , where the slope is    @xmath54    @xmath55 is the mach number of the shock . for strong shocks , @xmath56",
    ", this slope tends to @xmath57 .",
    "thus , in the strong shock limit , the energy and pressure in the resulting crs are broadly distributed towards the highest energies that are achieved . on the other hand , for weak shocks , @xmath58 with @xmath59",
    ", this tends to @xmath60 . in this case",
    "the fractional velocity jump across the shock is small , so the energy in crs accelerated from suprathermal values is concentrated in the lowest energy crs .",
    "that is , the crs gain relatively little energy before they escape downstream .",
    "consequently , for the same number of crs and the same kinetic energy flux through the shock , @xmath61 , the energy input to locally injected crs through dsa is much greater in strong shocks than in weak shocks .    as a consequence of this theory , it is apparent that even a modest injection of particles at a strong shock can lead to a substantial fraction of the kinetic energy flux into strong , initially purely hydrodynamical shocks going into crs .",
    "those , in turn backreact on and modify the structure of the shocks themselves . under these conditions",
    "the process of particle acceleration is described using nonlinear theory @xcite .",
    "the main outcome of that development is the formation of a compressive precursor to the shock , leading to an increase in the total shock compression , upstream turbulence and magnetic field amplification , followed by an actual weakening of the fluid shock transition ( the so - called ` sub - shock' ) . in a highly cr - modified shock",
    "a large part of the dsa process at high cr energies actually takes place in the precursor when the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath52 is an increasing function of particles momentum . then , the subshock is responsible mostly for the acceleration process at low energies @xcite and injection of seed dsa particles .",
    "the importance and detailed outcomes of nonlinear evolution in _ strong _ shocks depend on the size of the cr population at the shock , the hardness of the cr spectrum being accelerated at the shock , the efficiency and distribution of turbulent magnetic field amplification upstream of the shock and the geometry of the shock @xcite .",
    "these physical details are important , since they regulate how much energy is extracted from the flow into the shock and , accordingly how much pressure will develop from these crs and amplified magnetic field within the shock transition . on the other hand , unless they include much larger total cr populations or interact with a pre - existing cr population with a hard spectrum , _ weak shocks _ are minimally affected by nonlinear effects , because of the steeper cr spectra generated in these shocks .",
    "fig.4 shows the time evolution of crp spectra accelerated at simulated weak and stronger shocks . in the case of weak shocks",
    "the spectrum agrees with the prediction of test particle dsa theory , while the spectrum becomes concave and flatter than test particle dsa for stronger shocks , due to the non - linear back - reaction of crp .",
    "the quality of comparisons between real and theoretical strong , dsa - modified shocks is still an open question ( see the discussion at the end of this section ) .    the acceleration time - scale at the shock ( i.e. the time necessary for crs of energy @xmath62 to double that energy ) depends on the time interval between shock crossings for the cr , @xmath63",
    ", @xmath64 is the particle velocity , and on the ratio of the cr velocity to the fluid velocity change across the shock , so @xmath65 .",
    "thus , it primarily depends on the spatial diffusion coefficient of particles , and inversely on the shock velocity , @xmath41 , and the compression through the shock . in the simplified case that the spatial diffusion coefficient does not change across the shock , the mean acceleration time to a given momentum in an unmodified shock",
    "can be written as :    @xmath66    that approaches @xmath67 for strong shocks .",

    "the allowed region , marking the energies of crp that can be obtained via shock acceleration , is highlighted in blue.,width=491 ]    in order to derive a maximum energy of the accelerated crs in a given time interval we assume a bohm diffusion coefficient , @xmath70 , ( see also sect 2.2.2 ) where , @xmath71 , is the particle larmour radius .",
    "this is optimistically small , thus giving us an optimistic upper energy bound , since it assumes a mean free path equal to the cr gyroradius .",
    "the spatial diffusion coefficient for relativistic particles then becomes in practical terms ,    @xmath72    resulting in an acceleration time scale to gev energies of the order of 1 yr , if we assume a typical shock velocity in galaxy clusters , @xmath73 km / s , and @xmath74 g .",
    "then , from eqs.4 - 5 , @xmath75 gev , implying for realistic available acceleration times ( @xmath76 years ) that the power law distribution of the accelerated particles should extend up to very high energies , where energy losses or diffusion from the acceleration region quenches the acceleration process ( spatial diffusion in the icm is discussed in sect",

    "the energy losses for cre , due especially to synchrotron and inverse compton processes ( see sect .",

    "consequently , the `` spatially unresolved '' synchrotron spectrum `` from the downstream region '' will show a steepened spectral slope , @xmath81 .",
    "by contrast , crp in these shocks are not subjected to significant energy losses until they reach extremely high energies where they suffer inelastic collisions with cmb photons .",
    "crp with energies above a few hundred pev will produce @xmath82 when they collide with cmb photons , limiting their life - times to a period below a few gyr @xcite(figure 5 ) .",
    "most important , at energies above about @xmath83ev , such collisions produce pions , and each such collision extracts a significant fraction of the crp energy ( this is the same physics that determines the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff in the ultra - high energy cr spectrum ) . for example , for energies above @xmath84ev the crp life - time drops rapidly below @xmath14 yr ( fig . 5 ) .",

    "a critical , unresolved ingredient in shock acceleration theory is the minimum momentum of the seed particles that can be accelerated by dsa ; i.e. , the minimum momentum that leads to diffusive particle transport across the shock .",
    "this , along with the detailed processes that control this minimum momentum are crucial in determining the efficiency with which thermal particles are injected into the population of cre and crp .",
    "particles must have momenta at least several times the characteristic postshock thermal ion momenta in order to be able to successfully recross into the preshock space .",
    "quasi - thermalized particles are inherently less likely to recross in the upstream direction in weak shocks than strong shocks , because of the weaker dissipation in weak shocks ; i.e. , the ratio of the postshock thermal speed to the postshock convection speed is relatively smaller .",
    "injection is expected to depend sensitively on the charge / mass ratio of the injected species , since that determines the rigidity ( @xmath90 ) of particles at a given energy .",
    "for this reason , nonrelativistic electrons appear to be very difficult to inject from the thermal population ( because @xmath91 ) , so are likely to be far fewer than injected protons .",
    "typically some kind of upstream , pre - injection process , often involving protons reflected by the shock that generate upstream waves that can resonate with nonrelativistic electrons , is invoked to enable electron injection at shocks @xcite .",
    "the processes `` selecting '' the particles that can recross define so - called _ thermal - leakage injection_. it is important to realize that they are poorly understood , especially in the relatively weak shocks with large @xmath89 expected in cluster media .",
    "existing collisionless shock simulations , hybrid and pic simulations , have focused on strong shocks or low beta - plasma @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the shock normal is also important , since it strongly influences the physics of the shock structure @xcite .",
    "a connected , unresolved ingredient in nonlinear cr shock theory is the level of amplification of the magnetic field and its distribution within the shock due to cr - driven instabilities .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field through the full shock structure is important , since the magnetic field self  regulates the diffusion process of supra  thermal particles on both sides of the shock and also affects the injection process @xcite .",
    "there are several proposed models to amplify magnetic fields significantly within the cr - induced shock precursor @xcite ; none of them applies until some degree of shock modification already takes place .",
    "this means they only apply in strong shocks , so probably not in cluster merger shocks .",
    "some magnetic field generation and/or amplification downstream of curved or intersecting shocks may result when the electron density and pressure gradients are not parallel ( the so - called biermann battery effect @xcite ) , due to the weibel filamentation instability @xcite or when the downstream total plasma and pressure gradients are not parallel ( so - called baroclinic effects that amplify vorticity @xcite ) . amplification of turbulence and magnetic fields only downstream , however , have minimal impact on dsa , which depends essentially on those properties on both sides of the shock .    as a final remark we mention that there is still discussion on the spectrum of crs resulting from shock acceleration .",
    "although calculations in the last decade agreed on the conclusion that the spectra of crs accelerated at strong shocks are concave ( flat ) as a result of the dynamical back - reaction of crs ( figure 4 ) , current data for snrs seem to favour steeper spectra and suggest a partial revision of the theory @xcite .",
    "specifically , the absence of cr spectral concavity in modified shocks requires a relative reduction in acceleration efficiency or increased escape probability for the highest energy crs@xcite .",
    "galaxy clusters contain many potential sources of turbulence .",
    "these include cluster galaxy motions @xcite , the interplay between icm and the outflowing relativistic plasma in jets and lobes of agns @xcite , and buoyancy instabilities such as the magnetothermal instability ( mti ) in the cluster outskirts @xcite . however , the most important potential source of turbulent motions on large scales is the process that leads directly to the formation of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "mergers between clusters deeply stir and rearrange the cluster structure . in this case turbulence",
    "is expected from core sloshings , shearing instabilities , and especially from the complex patterns of interacting shocks that form during mergers and structure formation more generally @xcite ( figure 2 ) .",
    "such a complex ensemble of mechanisms should drive in the icm both compressive and incompressive turbulence , as also supported by the analysis of numerical simulations @xcite ; in figure 6 we report a sketch of the turbulent properties of the icm .",
    "large scale turbulent motions that are driven during cluster - cluster mergers and dark matter sub - halo motions are expected on scales comparable to cluster cores scales , @xmath92 kpc , and might have typical velocities around @xmath93 km / s , e.g. @xcite .",
    "these motions are sub  sonic , typically with @xmath94 , but they are strongly super - alfvnic , with @xmath95 , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this implies a situation in which magnetic field lines in the icm are continuously advected / stretched / tangled on scales larger than the alfvn scale ; that is , the scale where the velocity of turbulent eddies equals the alfvn speed , @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is the slope of the turbulent velocity power - spectrum , @xmath98 ) . below this scale , turbulent , `` reynolds stresses ''",

    "6 ) , see@xcite ] .",
    "however the icm is a `` weakly collisional '' plasma and can be very different from collisional counterparts , because it is subject to various plasma instabilities , e.g. @xcite . in many cases , as a result of plasma instabilities the ( relatively weak ) magnetic field is perturbed on very small scales . that provides the potential to strongly reduce the effective thermal particle ( and crs ) mean free path @xcite and also the effective viscosity of the fluid , below the classical braginskii viscosity determined by thermal ion - ion coulomb collisions .",
    "all these considerations about the velocities of large - scale motions and the effective particle mean - free - path in the icm allow us to conclude that the effective reynolds number in the inner icm is @xmath101 ; that is , much larger than it would be if it were determined by the classical ion  ion mean free path ( @xmath102 ) .",

    "also coherent wave phenomena in mhd turbulence can generate non - linear electrostatic waves ; for example lower hybrid electrostatic waves in the icm might be excited through the non - linear modulation of density in large amplitude alfvn wave - packets@xcite .",

    "however , given the importance of icm magnetic field strength estimates from faraday rotation in constraining cr populations , it is appropriate here to outline briefly how they are currently obtained .",
    "they depend , of course , on the circular birefringence at radio frequencies of a magnetized plasma .",
    "propagating through such a medium , the plane of linear polarization ( generally in synchrotron emission ) rotates through an angle @xmath269 , where @xmath270 , with @xmath271 the magnetic field component along the line of sight in @xmath106 g , @xmath272 is the electron number density in units of cm@xmath35 , and @xmath273 the differential path in kpc .",

    "typically , rm samples are taken from several moderately extended background and embedded synchrotron sources distributed across an area comparable to or larger than the cluster core . by adopting simple models for the systematic radial scaling between the magnetic field and the icm density , along with simple parameterization of the magnetic field turbulence spectrum several such analyses have been conducted , with typical resulting central icm magnetic field values @xmath283",
    "while uncertainties in individual cluster results are probably at least a factor @xmath284 , the general pattern of results seems fairly robust .",
    "returning to crs , we note that two principal mechanism proposals are presently advocated to explain the origin of cre emitting in giant radio halos : i ) ( re)-acceleration of relativistic particles by mhd turbulence in the icm @xcite and , ii ) continuous production of secondary electron - positron pairs by inelastic hadronic collisions between accumulated crp and thermal protons in the icm @xcite , and their combination @xcite .",

    "the constraints on the acceleration mechanisms are similar to those derived above for the coma radio halo .      despite the discussion above ( and in sect .",
    "2.2.2 ) that provides arguments that are consistent with the hypothesis that giant radio halos trace turbulent regions in merging clusters and possibly originate due to ( some type of ) turbulent - related mechanism of crs acceleration , many important points are still open .",

    "the measure of the formation rate of radio halos in galaxy clusters and its dependence on the cluster thermal properties ( dynamics , mass , temperature etc ) provides unique information on the physics of these sources .",
    "one of the main limitations of current studies is that only x - ray luminous clusters have been scrutinized with adequate radio observations , whereas only very poor information is available for less luminous systems @xcite that are expected to host fainter halos according to the correlation in fig .",
    "a similar limitation applies also to the most recent studies that focus on mass - selected cluster samples , that are based on sz - catalogs , that are indeed limited to cluster masses @xmath307@xcite .",
    "these limitations are due to the limited sensitivity of present radio observations , but soon will be eliminated thanks to a new generation of radio telescopes , such as lofar , askap , and in the longer period , the ska , that will survey the sky with unprecedented sensitivities to the cluster scale diffuse emission .",
    "lofar and , to a somewhat lesser extent , mwa and lwa , will be particularly important because they will observe at lower frequencies , between 10 mhz and 200 mhz , stepping into a basically unexplored frequency range .",
    "lofar observations and their combination with jvla observations and , for nearby radio halos , observations with single dish radio telescopes ( such as gbt and effelsberg ) , will allow derivation of spectral measurements of radio halos over unprecedented , wide frequency coverage , thus providing crucial constraints on theoretical models .",
    "in particular , one of the most intriguing theoretical hypotheses is the existence of radio halos with very steep spectra that are undetected by radio surveys at higher frequencies and that should be discovered by observations at lower frequencies@xcite . such a hypothesis is based on turbulent acceleration models that predict that less energetic merger events ( less turbulent ) generate radio halos with very steep spectra .",
    "since these less energetic mergers are more common , one can speculate that steep spectrum halos constitute a large population of halos that is presently invisible . according to present calculations that use the crude assumption that a _ fixed _ fraction of the cluster - merger energy goes into mhd turbulence available for particle acceleration on mpc - scale",
    ", the lofar surveys should detect about 500 new radio halos .",
    "about half of these halos should have very steep spectra @xcite . despite their still - early development and need for greater sophistication ,",
    "current models have been able to make some notable predictions .",
    "for instance , re - acceleration models predict that the shape of the luminosity functions of radio halos change with observing frequency due to the contributions of the expected population of steeper - spectrum halos at lower frequencies ( figure 14 ) .",
    "this differs from predictions based on other scenarios , including the hadronic model , where all halos should have to a first approximation similar spectra ( independent of the mass of the hosting clusters and of the energy released during mergers ) , and provides a valuable way to put constraints on the origin of these sources with future radio surveys .",
    "in particular , as shown in figure 14 , the most powerful way will be probably the combination of lofar surveys , at low frequencies , with future surveys with askap or apertif , at higher frequencies .",
    "in addition to the disturbed , merging clusters that have been found to host giant radio halos , a number of relaxed , cool - core clusters host faint , diffuse radio emission with a steep spectrum and a size comparable to that of the cool - core region @xcite ( figure 15 ) , so substantially smaller than the giant halos . as a first approximation one might have thought these sources as a version of giant radio halos scaled on smaller scales of the order of few 100 kpc in size rather than mpc size .",
    "however , the two classes of radio sources show prominent differences .",
    "first of all , in clear contrast to giant radio halos , mini halos are always found in dynamically relaxed systems suggesting that cluster mergers do not play a major role for their origin .",
    "also the synchrotron volume emissivity of mini halos differs from that of giant halos , being typically larger @xcite .",
    "whether the underlying physical mechanisms that accelerates the cre in mini halos differ substantially from the analogous mechanisms in giant radio halos is still unclear .",
    "clusters hosting mini halos always have central radio - loud agns exhibiting outflows in the form of radio lobes and bubbles inject cre into the central regions of galaxy clusters ( sect .",
    "2.1 ) . in principle",
    "these agns could represent the primary source of the crs in mini halos , however they are not sufficient by themselves , at least without some dynamical assistance , to explain the diffuse radio emission . in particular , a _",
    "slow diffusion problem _ once again exists for mini halos ; that is , the energy loss time scale of the radio emitting cre is still much shorter than the time needed by these particles to diffuse efficiently across the emitting volume .",
    "similarly to giant halos , two physical mechanisms have been identified as possibly responsible for the radio emission in mini halos : i ) re - acceleration of cre ( leptonic models or re - acceleration models ) and ii ) generation of secondary cre ( hadronic or secondary models ) .",
    "according to leptonic models mini halos originate due to the re - acceleration of pre - existing , relativistic cre in the icm by turbulence in the core region , e.g. @xcite .",
    "so , this model is similar in character to the turbulence model for giant halos , except that the responsible turbulence is concentrated in the cluster core region . in this case",
    "obvious sources of the seed cre are , for example , the buoyant bubbles that are inflated by the central agn and disrupted by gas motions in the core @xcite .",
    "a key question in this model is the origin of the turbulence responsible for re - accelerating the electrons . unlike giant halos ,",
    "merger shocks and mpc - scale motions / flows would not be candidates .",
    "gitti et al.(2002)@xcite originally proposed that the cooling flow of gas inward within the core could generate the needed turbulence .",
    "more recent x - ray observations however have shown that these `` classical cooling flows '' do not materialize , e.g. @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , observations suggest that even relatively relaxed clusters have large - scale gas motions in their cores at significant fractions of the local sound speed . the clearest observational signatures of these gas motions are spiral - shaped `` cold fronts '' seen in the majority of cool - core clusters @xcite .",
    "these cold fronts are believed to be produced by the cold gas of the core `` sloshing '' in the cluster s deep potential well , in response to passing dark matter subhalo motions , for example .",
    "those sloshing motions , can advect icm across the cluster core and can also produce turbulence there @xcite .",
    "remarkably , a correlation between radio mini halos and cold fronts has been discovered in a few clusters and has been used to suggest a connection between radio mini halos and turbulence generated by the sloshing motions@xcite .",
    "recent simulations@xcite support this hypothesis and have shown that the motions and turbulence generated by core sloshing in galaxy clusters can re - accelerate and spatially redistribute seed cre .",
    "those cre and magnetic fields amplified at the same time produce radio emission that resembles mini halos , being diffuse , steep spectrum , and connected with the spatial features of the x - ray emitting gas . as noted early in this review",
    ", agn activity also can dump considerable kinetic energy into the icm and drive cluster - core scaled icm motions ( sect .",
    "while these motions can mix cre into icm relatively near the agn outflows , larger scale flows , such as sloshing are probably necessary for those cre to become broadly distributed across the full cluster cores .",
    "current observational information on turbulent motions in cool cluster cores coming from x - ray emission lines is limited by relatively poor available spectral resolution . in the few cases of compact cool cores",
    "the turbulent velocities have been constrained and the turbulent pressures ( due to fluctuations on scales much smaller than the size of these compact cores ) are found to be less than @xmath7 10% of the thermal pressures @xcite .",
    "future observations with astro - h will provide much better constraints as they will be able to reveal the presence of small - scale turbulence ( with velocities down to about 100 km / s ) from the study of x - ray lines @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism proposed for the origin of mini halos is , just as for giant halos , based on the generation of secondary particles via inelastic collisions between crp and thermal protons @xcite . in this case",
    "the primary crp could be provided by the central agn and then advected , streamed or diffused across the cluster core . in this case",
    "an interesting issue is the possible connection between these crp , which ultimately generate the observed mini halos in this picture , and the heating of the icm in the region of the cool core .",
    "colafrancesco & marchegiani ( 2008)@xcite proposed a scenario where the cooling of the gas in the cool cores is balanced by the heating due to the crp via coulomb and hadronic interactions . in order to balance the cooling of the gas , these models assume that crs in cool cores carry a substantial fraction of the energy of the icm , a condition that however is ruled out by current @xmath9-ray observations that put severe limits to the energy budget of crs ( sect .",
    "3.3 ) in core regions@xcite .",
    "more recent approaches that model the crp - driven heating mechanism rely on the possibility that crp streaming and the related generation of mhd waves can heat the icm in the cool cores with an efficiency that may be much larger than that due to coulomb and hadronic interactions@xcite . under this hypothesis",
    "several calculations have derived consistent pictures of cool - core heating and generation of radio mini halos@xcite .",
    "discrimination between a leptonic and hadronic origin of radio mini halos is very challenging due to severe limitations of current observational constraints .",
    "although a correspondence between radio mini halos and cool core clusters is well established , current radio studies do not provide an exhaustive view of the occurrence of radio mini halos in galaxy clusters more generally .",
    "for example , it is still not clear whether these radio sources are common or rare in cool cores@xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath9-ray upper limits from the fermi satellite and ground based cherenkov telescopes are not yet deep enough to put strong constraints on the origin of these radio sources .",
    "for example , these limits do not put significant tension on a purely hadronic origin of mini halos @xcite .",
    "generally , in comparison with the case of giant halos , the combination of radio and @xmath9-rays constraints are less restrictive for mini halos , because the ratio of @xmath9-ray luminosity to radio luminosity is smaller .",
    "this is due to the fact that the likely value of the average magnetic field in the much smaller and more central volume occupied by mini halos is larger than that in the much bigger volume of giant halos ( see eq . 26 ) .",
    "in addition , we note that for the best test case , the mini halo in the nearby perseus cluster , the presence of strong @xmath9-ray emission from the central radio source 3c 84 ( ngc 1275 ) does not allow one to put stringent limits on the diffuse emission from the cluster core in the critical 0.2 - 10 gev band @xcite .",
    "one possibility to discriminate between different models is to look for differences in the integrated spectrum and spectral index maps .",
    "for example , compelling evidence for very steep spectra and/or for the existence of spectral breaks at high frequencies would favour a re - acceleration scenario rather than a hadronic origin in the mini halos .",
    "similarly to the case of giant halos , current mini halo radio observations cover too short a frequency range to constrain spectral curvatures .",
    "furthermore , the fractional contribution to the observed flux that is provided by discrete radio sources embedded in the halo volume is larger for mini halos , making good spectral measurements more challenging than in the case of giant halos @xcite .",
    "better spectral constraints might come from future observations at low ( e.g. with lofar ) and higher ( jvla ) radio frequencies .",
    "these radio telescopes , and their combination , should allow deeper imaging , with unprecedented dynamic range , and measurement of the diffuse synchrotron spectrum over a fairly wide frequency range .",
    "an obvious , interesting question is whether there is any connection between mini halos and giant radio halos or do they have independent physical origins ? despite the apparently distinct population distributions , there are , in principle , several arguments in support of a possible connection .",
    "indeed , one could argue that the driven flows and turbulent motions that destroy the icm cores of clusters during merger could also transport and re - accelerate crs on larger , mpc , scales .",
    "this , in fact , is a `` generic '' candidate - scenario that we propose to switch off bright mini halos and to begin powering giant radio halos in dynamically active systems . in this scenario complex situations where",
    "a central mini - halo is embedded in a lower brightness radio emission on larger scales should exist in dynamically `` intermediate '' systems ; abell 2142 could be one example@xcite .    in a recent work zandanel",
    "et al.(2013)@xcite proposed that mini - halos are primarily of hadronic origin , while giant radio halos experience a transition from central hadronic emission to leptonic emission component in the external regions due to cre re - acceleration .",
    "potentially , also diffusion and advective transport of crs in the icm can induce an evolution from mini to giant halos ( and vice - versa ) , assuming that this process is sufficiently fast ( i.e. , @xmath308 gyr ) on spatial scales of clusters cores .",
    "a similar evolution could be driven by the evolution ( amplification and dissipation ) of the magnetic field in the cluster core and periphery in response to mergers @xcite .",
    "observations with the next generation of observational facilities and similar advances in numerical simulations will hopefully clarify these issues in the near future .",
    "some merging clusters host peripheral , giant radio relics . as in the case of giant radio halos",
    ", a few tens of giant relics have been discovered so far .",
    "radio relics differ from radio halos in the morphologies , peripheral locations and polarization ( typically being up to 30% level in integrated linear polarization)@xcite ( figure 16 ) .",
    "these properties provide a clear starting point in establishing their origin .",
    "specifically , there is broad consensus that the giant radio relics trace shocks outside cluster cores , probably relatively strong merger shocks , where the emitting cre can be accelerated or re - accelerated@xcite .",
    "this model is based on the physics described in sect .",
    "in addition to probing the origin of crs in galaxy clusters , relics are also important probes of the magnetic field properties in the icm periphery , as they are found at distances up to a large fraction of the cluster virial radius , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the association between giant radio relics and shocks is based partly on the usually elongated morphologies of the relics , consistent with a shock seen relatively edge - on .",
    "in addition , the fact that in some cases the relics occur in pairs on opposite sides of the cluster core @xcite is telling , since emerging merger shocks should form in such pairs . in those",
    "paired relic cases a line between the relics is typically consistent with an apparent merger axis , as established by other observations , such as in the x - rays .",
    "in addition , the fact that relics are strongly polarized with an orientation that generally implies the magnetic field is aligned with the long axis of the relic , suggests that they originate in regions where the magnetic field is compressed in the shock plane @xcite .",

    "typically the life - time of cre radiating in the radio band is of the order of 100 myr implying a transverse size of radio relics @xmath218 kpc for a reference downstream velocity @xmath315 km @xmath316 and ics dominated losses ( with @xmath317 ) .",
    "this is consistent with observations , once projection effects are properly taken into account . in this case radio",
    "synchrotron spectral steepening with distance from the shock front is expected in radio relics with spatially resolved cross sections as a consequence of the fact that the oldest population of cre is also the most distant from the shock .",
    "this expectation is in agreement with several observations that provide evidence for steepening in radio relics along their transverse direction , from their front to the back@xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent analyses have shown evidences for synchrotron spectral curvatures along the transverse dimension of a few particularly favorable relics and also that the curvature increases with distance in the downstream area @xcite .",
    "the life - time of radio - emitting cre in the downstream region depends also on the magnetic field , @xmath318 , and the energy of electrons emitting at frequency @xmath313 is @xmath319 . for this reason",
    "the measure of the transverse size of relics at a given frequency @xmath313 , that is @xmath312 , provides also constraints on the magnetic field strength in these sources , provided the downstream velocity is known @xcite ; this is shown in figure 17 .",
    "the downstream velocity , @xmath320 ( @xmath321 is the sound speed in the upstream region and @xmath322 is the shock mach - number ) , can be derived from the density / temperature jumps at the shock measured by x - ray observations , or alternatively from the synchrotron injection spectrum measured at the leading edge of the relic ( assuming this is the location of the physical shock ) , using @xmath323 ( eq.3 ) .",
    "the above observational facts support a connection between giant radio relics and merger shocks , suggesting that cre are energized locally at these shocks and then age in the downstream region .",
    "however these observations do not tell us more about the physics of the acceleration mechanisms .",
    "shocks discovered in the x - rays , including those that coincide with radio relics , are apparently weak , with mach numbers determined from the x - rays estimates for density and/or temperature jumps across the shock region , @xmath324 @xcite .",
    "high resolution cosmological simulations are consistent with the observational data , suggesting that shocks with @xmath325 are rare well inside cluster virial radii @xcite .",
    "this , however , poses a problem for the origin of giant radio relics , because , as discussed in sect . 2.2.1",
    ", weak shocks are expected to be relatively ineffective as particle accelerators , especially if they are accelerating cr from nonrelativistic energies .",
    "this is partly because the equilibrium dsa spectrum of locally injected crs in such shocks is quite steep ( eq .",
    "3 ) , so most particles injected at the shock carry away relatively little energy .",
    "in addition , thermal leakage injection is likely to be less effective in weak shocks than strong shocks @xcite . using reasonable parameters for shocks with @xmath326 , less than @xmath327% of the thermal ion flux through such shocks",
    "should be injected into the crp population and less than a few percent of the shock energy flux should be transferred to freshly injected crp @xcite .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that all the above efficiencies refer to crp , while cre are the particles observed in radio relics .",
    "again , as pointed out above , primary cre are much more difficult to inject from the thermal pool into the cr population than crp ( sect.2.2.1 ) . in the galactic crs @xmath328 , presumably reflecting that constraint . an electron fraction even that large , and likely representing dsa at strong shocks , is already a theoretical challenge .",
    "thus , merger shocks seem very unlikely to inject thermal electrons and then to accelerate them to relativistic energies with efficiencies high enough to extract more than a tiny fraction of a percent of the energy flux through the shock @xcite .",
    "thus , the question is whether radio relics can be powered by the acceleration of the thermal particles of the icm at weak shocks .",
    "this may point to an alternate source for the cre that are available to be re - accelerated in the shocks by the dsa process .",
    "the synchrotron luminosity that is emitted in the radio band by assuming that a fraction @xmath329 of the kinetic energy flux through the shock - surface , @xmath42 , is transferred to supra - thermal ( and relativistic ) cre is ( see also @xcite ) :    @xmath330    where the dimensionless function @xmath331 is a few for @xmath332 and rapidly decreases for steeper spectra ( weaker shocks , eq .",

    "if we assume a reference acceleration efficiency of crp at weak , @xmath43 , shocks of about 1% , e.g. @xcite , an unusually large cre / crp ratio @xmath338 is required to match the observed synchrotron luminosity .",

    "it is worth mentioning that numerical simulations show variations of the mach number over shocks@xcite that potentially might produce some differences in the shock mach numbers derived from x - rays ( temperature or density jumps ) and from radio . in this case",
    "the radio mach number would be biased high because synchrotron emission is likely to be locally stronger in regions with higher mach number .    in principle",

    "if a pre - existing population of crs with a hard ( flat ) spectrum passes through such weak shocks , dsa can enhance the energy content of those crs by a factor of a few .",
    "this makes dsa re - acceleration at merger shocks a relatively more efficient process@xcite .",
    "additionally , the re - accelerated particle spectrum is similar to the spectrum of the pre - existing population if the latter is flat , so not the classic dsa spectrum for shock injected crs given in eq .",
    "the physical acceleration is still dsa , however ; the change reflects only the assumed source of particles being accelerated .",
    "the potentially higher efficiency of re - acceleration in these shocks is possible because the acceleration time needed to double the energy of each cr can still be relatively short ( see eq .",

    "based on that , one way to obtain meaningful expectations of the level of @xmath9-rays from galaxy clusters expected because of the existence of radio halos is provided by joint modelings of the production of secondary particles and of the re - acceleration of these secondaries ( and of the primary crp ) due to mhd turbulence in the icm @xcite . our ability to apply turbulent re - acceleration to refine the picture based on crp confinement and injection of secondaries in the icm",

    "contrary to the _ transient _ nature of giant radio halos and hard x - ray emission in galaxy clusters , @xmath9-ray emission is expected to be common at a moderate level in all clusters and not directly correlated with the presence of the currently observed giant radio halos . since the crp population of a cluster reflects its integrated history ( assuming crp do not escape ) there should be a moderate range in @xmath9-ray luminosities , e.g. @xcite .",

    "looking forward , we have placed emphasis on what appear to be the most important prospects for the near future from radio and high - energy observations .    as we have discussed in sect .",

    "one way to constrain the importance of these secondaries starts from the fermi - lat limits to @xmath9-ray emission .",
    "this is especially meaningful when combined with radio frequency information in nearby clusters hosting radio halos . in particular deep radio observations",
    "allow detection of the radio emission in these clusters up to their largest spatial scales and provide constraints on the spectrum of radio halos .",
    "these studies appear to challenge the classical , pure secondary injection model for radio halos .",
    "a unique and clear expectation of radio halo models based on turbulent acceleration is the existence of a large population of radio halos with very steep spectra .",
    "this prediction reflects the intrinsic difficulties of the mechanisms of stochastic acceleration by turbulence in accelerating cre to very high energies , and suggests that clusters with weaker turbulence will produce steeper radio spectra . in the next few years",
    "the lofar radio telescope will survey the northern sky at ( as yet ) unexplored low radio frequencies , thus allowing to unveil a large number of these sources if they exist .",
    "giant , peripheral radio relics have recently attracted much attention .",
    "this has been discussed in sect .",
    "there is general agreement on the fact that radio relics originate at shocks waves that cross galaxy clusters during mergers . a shock connection is motivated by strong arguments , including their morphology , polarization and spectral properties , but also by the observed spatial coincidence between radio relics and shocks found in some cases by x - ray observations . on the other hand , theory and",
    "x - ray observations agree on the fact that merger shocks are relatively weak , with mach numbers less than a few .",
    "significantly , they are much weaker than shocks in supernova remnants , where efficient crs acceleration is proved and strong magnetic field amplification is strongly suggested .",
    "there are very good reasons to expect particle acceleration to be much less efficient in weak shocks .",
    "so , these processes , that are so important in snr shocks , should be much less effective in cluster merger shocks and , so long as the accelerated population is locally injected at low energies , lead to a rather steep spectrum compared to those seen in some relics . in this respect radio relics",
    "are `` unique laboratories '' to study the acceleration of particles at large - scale , weak shocks in high - beta plasma environments . while first order , diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) at these shocks is the apparent candidate to explain the cr electron population seen in relics , there are fundamental concerns about the detailed , micro - physical mechanisms .",
    "in fact the most relevant concern is whether shocks in galaxy clusters are efficient enough to accelerate the emitting cre from the thermal pool to observed multi - gev energies . as discussed in sect .",
    "4.4 this appears not to be the case .",
    "although the classical model of dsa for locally injected cr electrons could account for properties of some relics , such a model is challenged by energy arguments combined with simulations of cr acceleration at weak shocks .",
    "this is especially a concern in the case of the most powerful relics and those with relatively flat spectra giant radio relics ( we note that very steep spectra of giant relics also challenge the classical dsa model due to associated energy arguments ) . a natural candidate - mechanism is the re - acceleration of pre - existing cre at these shocks , provided there is a scenario that produces them in sufficient numbers and maintains a sufficiently flat spectrum upstream of the shock .",
    "dsa is more efficient at extracting shock energy in this situation and does not constrain the spectrum of the downstream cr population to the `` classical dsa '' value if the cr population entering the shock has a flatter spectrum than this .",
    "radio relics pin - point the ( re)acceleration of cre at shocks in the icm .",
    "however , what about crp ? as discussed in sect .",
    "2 , shock acceleration is generally expected to be more efficient for crp acceleration rather than for cre . in this respect",
    "a consequence of current models of radio relics is the likely acceleration of a substantial population of crp in galaxy clusters . that , however , is strongly constrained by current luminosity limits in @xmath9-rays .",
    "consequently we can expect in the coming years the combination of radio and @xmath9-ray observations to provide interesting constraints on the physics of ( re-)acceleration of crs at clusters shocks and on the ratio crp / cre at these shocks .",
    "high energy emission from galaxy clusters has been discussed in sect .",
    "5 . galaxy clusters should be high energy sources .",
    "this is not only due to theoretical arguments based on acceleration and confinement of crs in these systems , but it is unavoidably expected at som elevel from the existence of the high energy cre that produce the synchrotron radiation observed in the radio band .    in particular hard x - ray emission is expected from ics of the cmb photons by essentially the same cre that produce synchrotron radiation in the radio band . in this case",
    "the expected ics luminosity depends on the magnetic field strength in the icm . as a conservative summary in sect .",
    "5.1 we stated that no ics emission is convincingly detected in the hard x - ray band , implying a lower limit to the cluster magnetic field of about 0.1 - 0.3 @xmath106 g in the cases of several nearby clusters hosting radio halos .",
    "these limits are substantially smaller than the current estimates of the magnetic field strength based on faraday rm .",
    "consequently the expected ics emission could very well be much smaller and well below current observational capabilities .",
    "gamma - ray emission from galaxy clusters is discussed in sect .",
    "5.2 ( and sect .",
    "these emissions are mainly expected from the combination of @xmath10-decay from crp - p collisions and ics from primary cre .",
    "the former mechanism should dominate in cluster central regions , while the latter one could be the most important mechanism in cluster outskirts .",
    "the @xmath9-ray luminosity of galaxy clusters and the expected ratio between @xmath10-decay and ics components are uncertain , as a consequence of our poor understanding of several aspects of the crs acceleration and transport processes in the icm .",
    "these mechanisms are , however , strongly connected with the physics of the observed radio sources . for this reason",
    "multi - frequency modelings and the combination of observations at both radio frequencies and high - energies have allowed derivation of important constraints on the origin of halos and relics , and also meaningful expectations for the resulting high energy emission from galaxy clusters .",
    "this has been extensively discussed in sect .",
    "another important point that has been discussed in this review is the maximum energy of crs that can be achieved in galaxy clusters .",
    "this has been discussed to some extent in sect . 2 where we focus on cre and crp ; we do not study the case of nuclei .",
    "of course , this is still very uncertain .",
    "based on current understanding of crs acceleration and transport / confinement in galaxy clusters it is possible to conclude that cre can be accelerated to multi - tev energies , while crp might also reach eev energies .",
    "in particular the possibility to accelerate eev protons in the icm is very appealing . as we mention in sect .",
    "5.2 , one possible way to unveil these particles , if they exist in galaxy clusters , is to detect the synchrotron hard x - rays and ics @xmath9-rays ( tev ) that are emitted by the secondary pairs that are produced through the interaction of these eev crp with the cmb photons .",
    "the next decade represents a `` golden age '' for studies of non - thermal components in galaxy clusters .",
    "this is one of the reasons that motivated us to write a review at this time .",
    "this expectation is especially true in radioastronomy , thanks to a new generation of radio telescopes , such as lofar and the ska pathfinders / precursors ( askap , meerkat , mwa , lwa ) .",
    "they will enter into unexplored territories , reaching unprecedented sensitivities to cluster scale emission over a broad frequency range .",
    "these telescopes will also allow polarization and faraday rotation studies of background and cluster radio sources with unprecedented statistics , frequency and dynamic range , probing cluster scale magnetic fields . as we briefly discussed in sect .",
    "4.1 ( and sect .",
    "4.2 - 4.4 ) , magnetic field properties and the polarization of diffuse cluster - scale sources are indeed central ingredients also for our understanding of crs acceleration and transport in the icm .",
    "one of the most notable examples of new , expected information is the spectrum of halos and relics . as discussed in sect .",
    "4 , the spectrum of these sources provide crucial information for the origin of the emitting cre . however , current observations allow derivation of high quality spectra only for a few cases . most important ,",
    "spectra are typically measured in a limited frequency range @xmath395 that probes the energy spectra of the emitting cre over a very narrow energy range .",
    "the combination of lofar with jvla observations ( potentially also in combination with data from single dish radio telescopes ) will allow spatially resolved and accurate measurements of halo and relic spectra over a frequency range 10 times bigger .",
    "that extension will open the possibility of deriving meaningful constraints of the cre energy distributions and their spatial evolution / variation .    as discussed in sect .",
    "4 , the surveys planned with the next generation of radio telescopes have the potential to probe the formation and evolution of cluster scale radio sources along with the evolution of the hosting clusters themselves .",
    "the apparent connection between halos and mergers suggests that these sources are valuable probes of the clusters merging history throughout the cosmic epochs . in this respect",
    "combined x - ray  radio and sz  radio statistical studies of the occurrence of radio halos in clusters will provide unique information on the origin of non - thermal components and on their connection with the clusters thermal properties . in this respect lofar surveys",
    "will be of great interest , as they will probe an unexplored frequency range where current models predict the existence of cluster - scale radio emission with very steep spectrum .    in our review",
    "we also stressed that presumably _",
    "current observations _ detect only the _ tip of the iceberg _ of the non - thermal radio emission from the cosmic web . in this respect",
    ", what is still unseen is the most attractive science case of the new generation of radio telescopes . in principle , according to the current theoretical picture , one may speculate that halos and relics pin - point only the regions where cre acceleration is most efficient",
    ". fainter synchrotron emission might be much more common and it may extend to scales even larger , thus tracing the complex pattern of shocks and turbulence that embed clusters and filaments . unfortunately , our current ignorance of plasma - physics in these environments does not yet allow physically solid attempts to establish whether the ska and its pathfinders will be able to detect these signals .    the future is bright also at high photon energies .",
    "first of all the hard x - ray telescopes nustar and astro - h will shortly derive constraints on the presence of non - thermal excess emission in galaxy clusters at a level that is about 10 times fainter than current studies .",
    "as discussed in sect .",
    "5.1 the detection of ics emission from the brightest halos and relics is only possible if the magnetic field is substantially smaller , at least a factor 2 - 3 , than that estimated from current rm analysis .",
    "however , even the non detection of nearby clusters hosting bright radio halos and relics at the sensitivity level of these telescopes would be a valuable result , providing very meaningful constraints on the magnetic field strength in these systems",
    ".    however , one of the most desired results from astro - h is the first measure , from the study of metal lines , of turbulent motions in the icm .",
    "this has been mentioned in sects . 2 and 4 .",
    "turbulence is a fundamental ingredient for current theoretical scenario , not only because it is important for the acceleration and transport of crs , but also because it is expected to strongly affect the micro - physics of the icm . in this respect",
    "we also mention that a gigantic step forward represented by measured turbulent motions in galaxy clusters is a central science case of x - ray telescopes with much better spectral resolution and effective area , such as _ athena+ _ , that may be launched in about 15 years .",
    "current constraints from @xmath9-ray observations allowed a gigantic step in our understanding of the crs content in galaxy clusters .",
    "this has been discussed in sects .",
    "3.3 , 4 and 5 also in the context of the impact of these constraints on models of giant halos and relics , and mini - radio halos .",
    "better constraints are expected from future and ongoing observations with the fermi - lat and from observations with the next generation of cherenkov telescopes , such as the cta . as discussed in sect .",
    "5 these observations will allow derivation of fundamental constraints on the physics of cre / crp acceleration and transport in the icm , and on the role played by secondary particles in the origin of giant and mini - radio halos .",

    "<S> radio observations prove the existence of relativistic particles and magnetic field associated with the intra - cluster - medium ( icm ) through the presence of extended synchrotron emission in the form of radio halos and peripheral relics . </S>",
    "<S> this observational evidence has fundamental implications on the physics of the icm . </S>",
    "<S> non - thermal components in galaxy clusters are indeed unique probes of very energetic processes operating within clusters that drain gravitational and electromagnetic energy into cosmic rays and magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> these components strongly affect the ( micro-)physical properties of the icm , including viscosity and electrical conductivities , and have also potential consequences on the evolution of clusters themselves . the nature and properties of cosmic rays in galaxy clusters , including the origin of the observed radio emission on cluster - scales , have triggered an active theoretical debate in the last decade . </S>",
    "<S> only recently we can start addressing some of the most important questions in this field , thanks to recent observational advances , both in the radio and at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of cosmic rays and of cluster non - thermal emissions depend on the dynamical state of the icm , the efficiency of particle acceleration mechanisms in the icm and on the dynamics of these cosmic rays . in this review </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in some detail the acceleration and transport of cosmic rays in galaxy clusters and the most relevant observational milestones that have provided important steps on our understanding of this physics . finally , </S>",
    "<S> looking forward to the possibilities from new generations of observational tools , we focus on what appear to be the most important prospects for the near future from radio and high - energy observations .    </S>",
