    "the overall evolution of the field response in the underdoped materials is also qualitatively consistent with the trend reported by sonier in ybco , where @xmath27 varies in a way that reflects superconducting @xmath34 . above optimal doping however , the system breaks from this trend , and the relaxation increases rapidly with @xmath10 content up to the largest doping explored .",

    "fit values for @xmath36 , large and positive in the underdoped materials , go negative at slight overdoping and tend towards zero as @xmath11 get large .",
    "we note that this critical doping has in the past been associated with the disappearance of glassy order in zf-@xmath2 measurements@xcite and the emergence of curie term in the bulk magnetization@xcite .",

    "[ eq : asy ] at several temperatures .",
    "a large signal anisotropy is immediately apparent , with the heterogeneous field response an order of magnitude larger when the field is applied perpendicular to the planes .",
    "this anisotropy is significantly larger than that observed by savici in @xmath38@xcite .",
    "the present data was taken in the ` transverse - field geometry ' , with the field applied perpendicular to the initial muon spin direction@xcite .",
    "previously published data on both underdoped@xcite and overdoped@xcite systems reveal zero relaxation within detection limits when in the ` longitudinal - field geometry ' , where the field is parallel to the initial muon spin direction . as discussed in detail by savici@xcite , these longitudinal - field @xmath2 experiments put upper limits on possible transverse fluctuation rates associated with the observed magnetism .",
    "this observation allows us to confidently associate relaxation of the tf-@xmath2 asymmetry with a broadening of the static internal magnetic field distribution , which has been an implicit assumption in the discussion thus far .",
    "it is important to note that this broadening of the internal field distribution is largely without an accompanying shift . by comparing the precession frequency of muons in lsco to those in a reference crystal of @xmath19",
    ", we observe that the average field of the muon site is within 0.5mt of the applied field at all temperatures in this study and over the entire doping range .",
    "this corresponds to a shift of @xmath280.01@xmath39 for @xmath20**h**=5 t .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of fields in @xmath15 has a fwhm of 5mt at t=2k in the same applied field .",
    "stated simply , muons at different ( crystallographically equivalent ) sites are observing radically different local fields at low temperatures , even though the average properties are changing very little .",
    "a large field - width with small average shift is contrary to what one would expect for a uniform sample response or commensurate long - range order .",
    "in fact , quite independent of model , this observation implies extensive heterogeneity in the local magnetic ground state .",
    "this comes as quite a surprise in systems which are often touted as canonical fermi liquids .",
    "it is only appropriate then to speculate on possible interpretations for the present data , and the remainder of the paper will discuss the feasibility of several such models .",
    "nqr studies have successfully applied a distribution - of - hole model to explain line - broadening in underdoped cuprates@xcite . in such a picture , holes are quasi - localized in the copper - oxide planes , and each frequency in a given distribution is associated with a unique hole density . though overdoped systems are expected to be more metallic ( and thus have more delocalized charge carriers ) , it is not unreasonable to expect that the holes in the current samples are likewise distributed .",
    "indeed , this idea is seemingly supported by earlier squid characterization , which revealed a small ( @xmath40 ) superconducting volume with a @xmath41 30k in some overdoped samples@xcite",
    ". however , the shifts in @xmath2 measurements of lsco are orders of magnitude smaller than those observed by nqr , and the sheer magnitude of the present effect makes it difficult to explain by a variation of hole densities alone .",
    "for example , muons in @xmath15 observe fields _ on average _",
    "5mt removed from the applied field at low temperature , with many muons seeing even larger fields .",
    "yet , there is no doping of lsco which would correspond to a 5mt shift .",
    "said another way , there is simply not enough variation in shift across the entire lsco phase diagram to explain the distribution of the fields in @xmath15 .",
    "more fundamentally , this model is incomplete , as it does not explain the doping evolution of magnetic properties nor the source of the doping heterogeneity ; it simply notes the _ existence _ of heterogeneity .",
    "thus , for a deeper understanding of these systems , further discussion of magnetic response is required .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , a similar response to applied field was observed by sonier _",
    "et al . _ in crystals of lsco and ybco , and successfully modeled as a consequence of heterogeneous superconductivity persisting to high temperatures@xcite .",
    "this model was predicated on the observation that the rate of relaxation in the underdoped ybco systems was proportional to superconducting @xmath14 , and indeed the collective data in underdoped lsco appear to follow a similar trend .",
    "however , the field response for the three most heavily doped samples increases monotonically with sr concentration , despite a weakening of superconductivity over the same doping range .",
    "thus , superconductivity seems like a less suitable candidate to explain a heterogeneous field - response in overdoped systems , and implies at least the existence of a separate relaxation mechanism which dominates at for large values of @xmath11 .",
    "other @xmath2 data have been interpreted as a signature of spin magnetism@xcite .",
    "again , heavily overdoped cuprates are known to be free from magnetic order or glassiness and are widely expected to be non - magnetic . yet , the curie term in bulk magnetization data is suggestive of emergent local moments on the overdoped side of the phase diagram@xcite , and there are theoretical grounds to expect such behaviour@xcite .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the most favourable band for doped holes in underdoped systems is the so - called zhang - rice band@xcite- a singlet band formed from the hybridization of @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 orbitals .",
    "however , long - standing studies by eskes and sawatzky@xcite predict a triplet band of mostly @xmath45 character at only slightly higher energies .",
    "this triplet band is predicted to become more stable with decreasing apical oxygen distance , which can be affected by the presence of dopant cations@xcite .",
    "there are existing x - ray studies that support both a decreasing apical oxygen distance@xcite and increased occupation of the @xmath45 orbital@xcite in overdoped systems .",
    "the slowing of longitudinal fluctuations amongst such emergent moments with applied field could certainly broaden the local magnetic field distribution in a similar manner to what is seen . to test the ability of this picture to explain our data",
    ", we simulated the expected @xmath2 asymmetry function from dipole coupling to a system 0.5@xmath46 aligned moments on 8@xmath39 of the planar copper sites .",
    "the density and size of the magnetic moments were entirely constrained by bulk magnetization data of wakimoto _ _ et al.__@xcite for @xmath15 .",
    "as expected for a dilute moment system@xcite , the simulated asymmetry decayed exponentially with time .",
    "however , even for completely saturated moments , the maximum expected relaxation rate in such a picture is @xmath171.5@xmath47- about 50@xmath39 smaller than the largest rate seen in @xmath15 .",
    "more fundamentally , simulations involving isolated and unconstrained ( also from bulk magnetization ) moments always result in a completely isotropic distribution of fields , in stark contrast to the large signal anisotropy demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropy ] .",
    "one may be able to reconcile an isolated moment picture with the data , but only if one includes a(n ) ( anisotropic ) staggered sample response which at least partially compensates a larger local moment .",
    "alternatively , kopp _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite have argued that the overdoped cuprates may be characterized by competing ferromagnetism , with an eventual transition to a ferromagnetic ground state at some critical doping . in support of this idea ,",
    "band calculations by barbiellini and jarlborg@xcite predict that regions of weak ferromagnetism should emerge around clusters of dopant ions in @xmath48 at high dilution . as with the isolated moment picture however , it is difficult to reproduce the largest observed relaxation rates within a ferromagnetic cluster picture , since now the _",
    "total _ moment in the system is constrained by bulk magnetization to be 0.5@xmath49 per overdoped hole .",
    "specific modeling suggests the ferromagnetic cluster model can increase the predicted relaxation rate by up to 20@xmath39 over the isolated moment picture , but one is still unable to recreate the size or anisotropy of the field - response observed in @xmath15 without including a staggered component to the local magnetism .",
    "perhaps a simpler explanation of the observed line - broadening is that it reflects clusters of staggered magnetic moments , possibly seeded by the dopant cations themselves .",
    "the temperature , field and orientational dependence of the current effect bear striking resemblance to data previously reported by nmr@xcite and @xmath2@xcite studies of zn - doped ybco , from which many infer the existence of staggered islands .",
    "isolated islands with a net magnetic moment would act much like isolated paramagnetic moments , and would broaden the local field distribution in similar way . yet , the net moment of an island would be greatly reduced from the total local moment and could easily reconcile the small effect seen in bulk magnetization with the larger effect seen here ( c.f . ref .  ) .",
    "specific simulations by us confirm that the current data for @xmath11=0.30 are consistent with an island with radius @xmath50 one lattice parameter .",
    "in such a scenario , the linear increase of @xmath35 with @xmath11 in fig .  [ fig : xdependence ] is immediately understood to be a consequence of an increasing number of nucleation centers for impurity - induced magnetism .",
    "the rapid decrease in @xmath36 upon overdoping might reflect a shrinking magnetic correlation length ( and thus island size ) , which would increase the total uncompensated spin of the islands and enhance @xmath51=0 magnetic susceptibility at the expense of the staggered susceptibility .",
    "consistent with shrinking magnetic correlations , we again mention the disappearance of glassy static magnetism@xcite and the emergence of curie - like magnetization@xcite around the same doping .",
    "the enhanced field - response of @xmath52 over lsco@xcite and @xmath53 over ybco@xcite further supports the central role of dopant cations rather than doped holes .",
    "the interpretation of nmr results in zn - doped ybco is still being actively discussed@xcite .",
    "however , local regions of staggered magnetization about dopant @xmath7 ions are predicted by a number of theoretical studies and expected to arise from correlation effects , even in metallic cuprates@xcite .",
    "et al . _ recently argued that completely analogous physics is expected in zn - free lsco due to weak coulombic disorder from @xmath10 cations@xcite .",
    "thus , it is perhaps not surprising that we have observed data consistent with staggered moments . whether it is appropriate to apply these underdoped studies to the more fermi - liquid - like overdoped systems is not obvious and deserves further study . in support of this idea",
    "however , we note that strong correlations have already been inferred from an enhanced kadowaki - woods ratio in @xmath15@xcite , and both inelastic neutron scattering@xcite and @xmath2@xcite report an enhancement of antiferromagnetic fluctuations with zn - doping in heavily overdoped systems .",
    "antiferromagnetic fluctuations seem to decrease with sr - doping in the zn - free ( and zn - doped ) systems@xcite , but this may actually reflect a decreasing magnetic correlation length , inferred above to be less than one lattice parameter at @xmath11=0.30 .",
    "further , the application of magnetic field may encourage staggered magnetism where little is seen in zero field .",
    "indeed , the central role of field is noted in theoretical studies of staggered magnetism in zn - doped lsco@xcite , and in at least one cuprate system , applied field is seen to modify neutron spectra in a way that parallels disorder@xcite . to explore these ideas more thoroughly",
    ", we strongly encourage future measurements of the inelastic neutron spectrum of heavily overdoped cuprate systems in applied field and with varying levels of disorder .",
    "we have presented tf-@xmath2 data on overdoped @xmath0 which shows a large broadening of the local magnetic field distribution in response to applied field over a range of temperatures .",
    "the temperature , field and orientational dependence closely reflects similar data reported in underdoped materials .",
    "characterization of the data through fits to a curie - weiss function shows a roughly linear increase of @xmath35 with @xmath10 concentration , but a marked shift in @xmath36 above optimal doping , where a curie term in the bulk magnetization also emerges .",
    "though emergent paramagnetic moments and ferromagnetic clusters have been explored as possible explanations for the current data , it is difficult to reconcile the large local response with the weak bulk magnetization without including a staggered component to the local magnetism .",
    "we suggest that a simpler explanation of our data is dopant - induced staggered magnetization seeded by @xmath10 disorder and stabilized by field .",
    "future experiments to investigate the effects of field and disorder in the overdoped cuprates are encouraged .",
    "we emphasize the role that heterogeneity must play in any explanation of the current data .",
    "this is in contrast to the homogeneous fermi - liquid ground state envisioned by many to exist in these systems , and implies at least strong correlation effects in the overdoped region of the phase diagram .",
    "the heterogeneous field response seen here complements previous reports of phase separation at low temperatures , and suggests that heterogeneous superconductivity at low temperatures may have its origin in a heterogeneous metallic state above @xmath14 .",
