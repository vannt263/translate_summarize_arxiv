    "ic4634 is one of the most spectacular point - symmetric planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "its remarkable double - s - shaped morphology is reflected in its kinematics , with two oppositely directed pairs of red- and blue - shifted features straddling the nebula ( schwarz 1993 ) .",
    "the morphology and kinematics suggest a precession or rotation of the source that produced these highly symmetric outflows .",
    "we have used narrow - band archival _ hst _ images in the [ o  iii ] , h@xmath0 , and [ n  ii ] lines to study the morphology of ic4634 and used complementary ctio 4 m telescope long - slit echelle observations of the h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] @xmath16583 lines to carry out a detailed study of its spatio - kinematical structure .",
    "the _ hst _ image of the central region of ic4634 ( figure  1-top - left ) reveals several morphological constituents . the nebula has a sharp central elliptical shell surrounded by a misaligned elliptical envelope .",
    "further emission found along pa@xmath2 and @xmath3 seems to form part of an irregularly shaped outer envelope .",
    "what makes ic4634 so remarkable are the two pairs of low - ionization , s - shaped arcs .",
    "in addition to these complex point - symmetric features , the image of the outermost regions of ic4634 ( figure  1-top - right ) shows an arc - like string of knots located at @xmath4 north of the central star .    the bottom pictures in figure  1 reveals the bow - shock morphology of the outer north s - shaped arc ( the south counterpart has similar morphology ) .",
    "the [ o  iii ] and h@xmath0 emission in these bow - shocks precede the [ n  ii ] emission , indicating shock excitation .",
    "a shock velocity of 80 - 160  km  s@xmath5 is derived from the [ o  iii]/h@xmath0 line ratio .",
    "the [ n  ii ] emission from the bow - shocks shows developing instabilities .",
    "the [ n  ii]-bright string of knots arises from the edge of the bow - shocks , suggesting that they might be trailed material from the bow - shock .",
    "the h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] echellograms provide further insights on the structure  of ic4634 .",
    "the inner shell can be described as an ellipsoide with its northwestern tip receding from the observer .",
    "the inner low - ionization arcs expand at an almost constant v@xmath6 of @xmath720  km  s@xmath5 in opposite direction to the inner shell .",
    "the radial velocity in the outer low - ionization arcs shows an abrupt change from the bow - shock structure to the linear string of knots , suggesting a deceleration .",
    "a counterpart of the outermost arc - like string of knots is detected to the south of ic4634 at a radial velocity similar to its systemic velocity .",
    "from these results , we conclude that ic4634 has experienced a complex history of multiple collimated outflows .",
    "these outflows have been ejected along different directions and very likely during different phases of the pn formation ."
