    "the size evolution is more dramatic for the early - type population than for the spiral - like galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "although the general evolution of the stellar mass - size relation with cosmic time ( z @xmath8 3 ) is starting to be well understood ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , making sense of how the environment has affected the evolution of the stellar mass - size relation is by far less clear . for instance , at intermediate to high redshift ( @xmath9 ) , @xcite and @xcite find that elliptical galaxies have larger sizes when belonging to groups or clusters .",
    "however , works by @xcite and @xcite showed no difference in a similar range of masses and redshifts .",
    "moreover , even the opposite result has been found by @xcite .",
    "exploring early - type galaxies in clusters at z=1.3 , they found that these objects are more compact in clusters than in the field .",
    "an interesting result by @xcite reported that although early - type galaxies are larger when residing in dense environments at z @xmath10 1 , this trend seems to be weakened as we come closer to the present - day universe ( z @xmath11 1 ) .",
    "in the nearby universe , the effect of the environment in the stellar mass - size relation of the galaxies is also not clear . in the case of early - type galaxies , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "found no size difference between those objects with the same mass in different environments .",
    "however , @xcite found that elliptical galaxies are more compact in clusters than in the field .",
    "for spiral galaxies , @xcite report a slight trend for low / intermediate mass ( @xmath12 ) spirals to be larger in the field than in groups .",
    "@xcite using the amiga sample detected that massive ( @xmath13 ) isolated spirals are @xmath14 larger than those located in dense environments , however , no size differences were reported for lower mass spirals .",
    "both in the nearby universe as well as in the high - z galaxies , the discrepancies found in the literature can be explained by the relatively modest sample of galaxies analysed , typically on the order of few thousands of galaxies or less , with the largest sample being that used in the work of @xcite which includes @xmath15 galaxies .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to re - analyse this situation by exploring the stellar mass - size relation of both early and late - type galaxies using the large collection of data available in the nyu - vagc catalogue @xcite .",
    "this huge dataset allows the sizes of the galaxies to be analysed at a fixed stellar mass with an unprecedented quality from the statistical point of view .",
    "in fact , the number of galaxies we use in this work is a factor @xmath16 larger compared to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to the average size of galaxies at a given stellar mass depending on the environment , another quantity that deserves attention is the scatter of this relation .",
    "it is worth noting that the measured scatter found in the fundamental plane and other scaling relations @xcite is much lower than the one predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "the large scatter in the theoretical works are the consequence of the intrinsic stochastic nature of the merging processes .",
    "for this reason , only models with very fine - tuned input conditions on the progenitors are able to reproduce the low dispersion values observed in the stellar mass - size distribution . despite the enormous interest of measuring this quantity ,",
    "little effort has been made observationally in this direction . to the best of our knowledge , using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data , only @xcite have quantified this dispersion segregating the galaxies according to their morphology in the stellar mass - size plane .",
    "however , no attempt has been made measure the scatter segregating the galaxies according to their environment .",
    "this is understandable again due to the modest size of the samples used to explore the effect of the environment both at low and high - z .",
    "as we will show through this paper , the environment only marginally affects the scatter of the stellar mass - size relation and , consequently , the use of large datasets is necessary to identify the role played by the environment in shaping the stellar mass - size plane .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : data ] contains a description of the data used in this work ; section [ sec : environment ] describes the different definitions of environment and the sample selection ; section [ sec : size - scatter ] is dedicated to study the stellar mass - size plane . finally , our results are shown in section [ sec : results ] and discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "our data is entirely drawn from the publicly available nyu value - added galaxy catalogue @xcite based on the sdss - dr7 @xcite .",
    "this catalogue contains around @xmath22 objects with spectroscopic redshift determination , mostly below @xmath23 . besides photometric and spectroscopic information extracted from sdss - dr7 ,",
    "the nyu - vagc catalogue also provides structural parameters , k - corrections and stellar mass estimates @xcite derived using a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) with population synthesis model from .    in this work , to minimize potential biases due to the size evolution of the galaxies with redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) we restrict our redshift range to @xmath24 , which is equivalent to a cosmic time interval of only 1.5 gyr .",
    "we have explored whether there is any significant size evolution within this redshift range .",
    "to do that , we have divided our sample in two redshift bins ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and computed the mean sizes within each of these bins .",
    "there is not size difference between these two intervals .",
    "the sdss - dr7 catalogue has irregular limits ( see figure [ fig : geometria ] ) . at the edges of the survey",

    "the nyu - vagc catalogue is spectroscopically complete ( @xmath31 ) up to @xmath32 magnitude @xcite .",
    "this flux cut in the _",
    "r_-band introduces a bias in the stellar mass distribution of the galaxies that needs to be addressed before exploring the stellar mass - size distribution .",
    "in particular , this effect must be corrected to avoid our sample being biased towards young galaxies , especially at lower masses .    to illustrate how the _",
    "r_-band magnitude limit affects the stellar mass distribution of our galaxies , we show in figure [ fig : completeness_histo ] the distribution of mass in the redshift range @xmath33 . starting from the higher mass bins , the number of galaxies increases as we move towards the lower masses until a peak in the histogram",
    "is reached . at this point , galaxies with masses below that peak start to be undetected and the sample becomes incomplete .",
    "consequently , we identify the mass where the peak of this histogram is reached as the mass completeness limit . as it depends on the redshift range ,",
    "we divide our sample in several redshift bins and study the corresponding histogram for each of them , obtaining the completeness limits showed in figure [ fig : completeness ] .",

    "the number of detected objects increases as we move towards lower stellar masses until the maximum of the histogram is reached . at this point , although the number of galaxies should keep growing , less massive objects start to be missed because of the _ r_-band spectroscopic magnitude limit ( @xmath32 ) from sdss - dr7.,width=317 ]    where @xmath37 is the stellar mass limit as a function of the redshift in solar masses , @xmath38 is a free parameter of the fit , corresponding to the mass - to - light ratio in the _ r_-band at the completeness mass limit , @xmath39 is the absolute magnitude of the sun also in the _",

    "this value of the mass - to - light ratio corresponds to a population of @xmath46 gyr , according to the miuscat seds developed by @xcite and @xcite with a @xcite imf and solar metallicity .",
    "the results of this analysis show that , even selecting the peak of the mass distribution at each redshift , it is likely that some very old and metal - rich galaxies could be missed from our sample . in order to test whether our results could be affected by this potential incompleteness , we have conducted the full analysis of our work using a more conservative mass - to - light ratio of @xmath47 , i.e. an age of 12.5 gyr .",
    "that corresponds to stellar mass limit of @xmath48 at @xmath34 .",
    "our tests show that using this very conservative mass limit do not change our results while our sample of galaxies would be considerably reduced and henceforth our errors increased .",
    "consequently , in what follows we use the stellar mass limit determined using equation [ eq : completness ] and equivalent to @xmath45 .",
    "the effect of the age on the completeness of the stellar mass is well illustrated in figure [ fig : completeness ] .",

    "our final sample is shown in figure [ fig : neigh - completeness ] .      to construct the stellar mass - size distribution of our sample ,",
    "a reliable measure of the size of each galaxy is crucial .",
    "the sizes of the galaxies as well as the shape of their surface brightness distributions are provided by the nyu - vagc catalogue .",
    "these parameters were determined using a @xcite fit to the radial intensity profile obtained using circular apertures @xcite :    @xmath50\\ ] ]    @xmath51 is the central intensity , @xmath52 is the srsic index and @xmath53 is a function of @xmath52 such as @xmath54 is the effective radius .",
    "the srsic index correlates with the morphology of the galaxy @xcite : objects with @xmath55 are mostly discy , while those with @xmath56 are bulge - dominated or spheroids @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of this phenomenon to separate our sample into galaxies with different morphologies ( @xmath56 and @xmath55 ) and probe the effect of the environment in each subgroup . in this work ,",
    "we use the circularized effective radius @xmath57 as a measurement of the size of the galaxy .",
    "in this paper we study the stellar mass - size relation in different large scale ( @xmath58 mpc ) environments .",
    "we use two different approaches to define whether the galaxies reside in a high - density or a low - density region .",
    "our first estimation of the environment is computed using the stellar mass surrounding each object within a physical radius . for our second estimator of the environment ,",
    "we use several catalogues of galaxy clusters .",
    "galaxies in these clusters are compared with galaxies in the field . in this section ,",
    "we detail how these different density indicators are obtained .",
    "different methods for measuring the environment of galaxies are used in the literature .",
    "these methods can be divided in two main groups : estimators based on the number of neighbours within an aperture of a fixed radius and estimators based on the distance to the @xmath52-th nearest neighbour .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of survey edges , redshift - space distortions ( the finger of god effect ) and other effects on mock catalogues among different environmental estimators , finding that fixed aperture methods are more robust to the previously mentioned effects while providing a direct density measure . despite its advantages ,",
    "this method present two drawbacks that have to be taken into account : the sensitivity in low - density environments and the fact that is a quantized measurement .",
    "other studies as those of @xcite and @xcite also support fixed aperture methods as a useful tool to define the surrounding density of a galaxy . in particular",
    ", @xcite found that the optimal radii for this kind of method is @xmath58 mpc .    with these studies in mind",
    ", we use a fixed aperture method to make our first measurement of the environmental density .",
    "the characterization of the environmental density is done as follows . for each galaxy in our stellar mass - complete sample ,",
    "we explore what is the number and total mass of the surrounding galaxies in a sphere of 2 mpc radius , centred on our targeted galaxy .",
    "note , however , that not all the surrounding galaxies can be used to make an estimation of the environmental density around our galaxies . in fact , to conduct an homogeneous description of the environment along our whole sample , only galaxies with @xmath59 are considered to estimate the density ( see figure [ fig : neigh - completeness ] ) .",
    "this mass limit corresponds to the mass limit of our sample at @xmath34 .",
    "to define the sphere and the position of each object in the survey , we use cartesian coordinates defined by the set of equations [ eq : cartesian ] , where @xmath60 is the right ascension of the galaxy , @xmath61 its declination , @xmath44 its redshift and @xmath62 is the co - moving radial distance :    @xmath63    our density @xmath64 for each galaxy is hence defined as :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the stellar mass of the @xmath67-th neighbour with @xmath59 located at a radial distance less than 2 mpc to the @xmath68-the galaxy in our sample . in the above equation @xmath69 mpc .    .",
    "to make sense of our numbers the coloured regions indicates the typical density values of galaxies located in abell clusters of different richness.,width=317 ]    figure [ fig : histogram ] represents the distribution of the environmental density for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the gap between the bin at @xmath70 and the first at @xmath71 reflects the discretization of our estimator , as previously mentioned : the minimum non - zero value @xmath64 can take is that corresponding to one companion with a mass of @xmath35 . to check if our density estimator truly segregates the different large - scale structures , we computed the same number @xmath64 for galaxies in our catalogue located in abell clusters @xcite .",
    "when we compare their values with the histogram in figure [ fig : histogram ] , it is clear that objects belonging to clusters are in the highest - density regions of the histogram .    to assess the effect of the environment on the stellar mass - size distribution we have considered the galaxies in the two most extreme ends of figure [ fig : histogram ] .",
    "galaxies in the top @xmath72 ( i.e. @xmath73 ) of the distribution are considered to be located in high - density regions , whereas galaxies in the bottom @xmath72 reside in low - density regions . since",
    "more than @xmath72 of the main sample have @xmath70 , the bottom @xmath72 have been randomly taken from all the galaxies in our sample with @xmath70 ( first density bin of the distribution on figure [ fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "several tests have been run changing the aperture @xmath74 used in the search and the percentage ( i.e. the value of @xmath64 ) defining each environment . as we will show later ,",
    "these tests show that these changes do not severely affect the final result .",
    "the present definition provides a compromise between exploring extreme environments and getting a statistically significant representation for each of them .",
    "galaxy clusters are the highest - density large - scale structures in the universe .",
    "consequently , another way to compare galaxies in different environments is by selecting galaxies residing in galaxy clusters and confronting them with field galaxies ( those outside these cluster environments ) . in order to do that",
    ", we compile a large sample of galaxy clusters in our explored volume using different catalogues : the abell catalogue @xcite , a catalogue extracted from sdss - dr6 @xcite , three catalogues from sdss iii @xcite , the gmbcg cluster catalogue @xcite and the xmmi - sdss galaxy cluster survey @xcite .",
    "a total of 1877 galaxy clusters are used in this work , containing more than @xmath75 galaxies within our stellar mass - complete subsample .",
    "similarly to the previous estimator , a sphere of 2 mpc radius is defined around the centre of each cluster using cartesian coordinates as in section [ sec : ndensity ] .",
    "thus , every galaxy inside this sphere is considered a cluster galaxy and the rest of the sample form the field sample . to avoid duplicates due to overlapping ,",
    "if a galaxy is selected as belonging to two different clusters , the object is only assigned to the nearest cluster .",

    ", we use a maximum likelihood method . to implement this method",
    ", we consider a sample of @xmath52 galaxies within a mass range and compute the likelihood for each possible value of @xmath77 and @xmath78 as follows :    @xmath79}{2\\sigma_{\\ln r}^2}\\right\\}\\ ] ]    where @xmath80 represents the size of each of the @xmath52 galaxies in the sample .",
    "the above expression is more easily computed if logarithms are taken on both sides , turning the product into a sum :    @xmath81=\\sum_{i=0}^n\\left(\\ln\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{\\ln r}r_i}\\right]-\\frac{\\ln^2[r_i/\\overline{r}(m)]}{2\\sigma_{\\ln r}^2}\\right)\\ ] ]    the best estimates for the parameters ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) will be those producing the maximum value of @xmath82 .",
    "the maximum likelihood estimation is implemented here using an iterative grid search in the parameter space , obtaining the most likely values for our parameters given our distribution . with this method",
    ", we also obtain their 1@xmath83-errors , computed as the contour including @xmath84 of the normalized likelihood in the grid .",
    "to study how the galaxies are distributed in the stellar mass - size plane , we segregate them by their morphology ( estimated using the srsic index as pointed in section [ sec : size ] ) : objects with @xmath56 are considered spheroidal while objects with @xmath55 are mostly disc - like galaxies .",
    "having the galaxies separated according to their morphology , we apply the maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the most likely values for the mean size and the scatter of the distribution . in order to do that",
    ", we divide each morphological and environmental sample in different mass bins .",
    "the width of each mass bin is taken so that each mass bin contains the same number of galaxies from the main sample .",
    "for each bin of stellar mass we use the maximum likelihood method to estimate both the more likely mean size @xmath77 , dispersion @xmath78 and their 1@xmath83-errors .",
    "figure [ fig : diffr - neigh ] represents the mean size estimation for the different morphologies and environments . in the lower panels of figure [ fig : diffr - neigh ] ,",
    "we show the ratio between @xmath77 for the @xmath72 most underdense and @xmath72 most overdense regions , both for late ( @xmath55 ) and early - type ( @xmath56 ) galaxies .",
    "late - type galaxies ( left panels in figure [ fig : diffr - neigh ] ) with intermediate masses @xmath4 show the largest difference among environments , being larger when they reside in low - density regions . on average",
    ", late - type galaxies in low - density environments are @xmath85 larger than those in the highest density regions . regarding early - type galaxies ( right panels in figure [ fig : diffr - neigh ] ) , they present also a difference of size with the environment , although this is less prominent than for the late - type case : @xmath86 .",
    "in addition to the mean sizes , we analyse the dispersion of the distribution in different environments .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ fig : diffs - neigh ] .",
    "the most remarkable finding is that for early - type galaxies the scatter in the distribution of sizes is @xmath87 larger in the underdense region compared to overdense zones . for late - type galaxies",
    "there is no mean difference among the environments ( i.e. a mean difference of @xmath88 when the full population is considered ) .",
    "however , it seems that there is a trend towards larger scatter of the sizes in the low mass ( @xmath89 ) regime of galaxies in underdense regions and the opposite behaviour at larger masses ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these differences could be as high as @xmath14 , depending on the exact bin mass .",
    "we summarize our results of this section in tables [ table : lateneigh ] and [ table : earlyneigh ] .",
    "as previously explained , the 1-@xmath83 errors were obtained as the contour in the parameter space which contains @xmath84 of the normalized likelihood .",

    "we compute the best estimations for @xmath77 and @xmath90 using the maximum likelihood method explained in section [ sec : par - estimation ] for each mass bin .",
    "the stellar mass - size relation for galaxies in the field and in clusters can be seen in figure [ fig : diffr - clusters ] .",

    "the dispersion of the stellar mass - size distribution is shown in figure [ fig : diffs - clusters ] .",

    "early - type galaxies show a trend of being more scattered on the field that in clusters , with an average of @xmath94 . again , this trend is more pronounced for the lowest mass bins ( @xmath4 ) .    numerical values for the parameters obtained and their errors are shown in tables [ table : lateclust ] and [ table : earlyclust ] with the corresponding 1@xmath83-errors .",
    "the significant increase in the number of galaxies provided by the sdss survey allows us to explore the stellar mass - size distribution of galaxies as a function of the environment with an unprecedented accuracy .",

    "to have a hint of the effect of the observational errors on the observed scatter of the stellar mass - size relations ( see section [ sec : discussion ] ) , we conduct a simple experiment using the mean sizes at a fixed stellar mass obtained in section [ sec : size - scatter ] for the whole sample .",
    "we consider that the errors on the measurements of the stellar mass ( @xmath95 ) and sizes ( @xmath96 ) of the galaxies are gaussianly distributed .",
    "the different errors used ( optimistic , realistic , pessimistic scenarios ) are :        we generate 5000 random mock galaxies following the gaussian distributions given by the errors with the mean in stellar mass and size corresponding to the measured values . on doing this",
    ", we simulate the scatter around the stellar mass - size relation produced by the observational errors for both late and early - type galaxies in the clusters , in the field and in the whole sample .",
    "finally , we apply the maximum likelihood method detailed in section [ sec : par - estimation ] to the mock samples .",
    "this allows us to obtain the scatter values corresponding to a sample only dominated by errors .",

    "figure [ fig : errors_mock ] shows the resulting distribution and the measured scatter for different error values , both in stellar mass and in size , as well as the observed and intrinsic scatter ( i.e. the corrected value accounting for the error simulation ) for different values of the observational errors .",
    "it is interesting to note how at higher stellar masses the observed scatter becomes dominated by errors in the second and third cases ( middle and lower panels ) .",
    "in fact , figure [ fig : errors_mock ] shows a larger scatter in the pessimistic scenario for high stellar masses than that observed in this work , probably because the assumed errors in this simulation is larger than the errors in our sample ."
