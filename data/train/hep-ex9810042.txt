    "from 1990 to october 1995 the lep @xmath2 storage ring was operated at center - of - mass energies close to the z mass ( called lep1 program ) .",
    "lep1 data have been collected and analysed by the 4 lep experiments aleph@xcite , delphi@xcite , l3@xcite and opal@xcite , the electroweak results and their combination are given in ref.@xcite and are still preliminary . since 1992",
    "the sld detector is taking data on the slc @xmath2 storage ring operating at center - of - mass energies also close to @xmath3 with polarised electron beam .",
    "the preliminary results from sld include 1992 to 1997 data @xcite . + the cross sections and the asymmetries of the reactions @xmath4 measured at lep and slc are sensitive , through radiative corrections , to the following standard model parameters : the strong coupling constant @xmath1 , the higgs mass @xmath5 and the top mass @xmath6 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is mainly determined by the lep total cross section measurements , while the asymmetries measured at lep and slc are most sensitive to @xmath5 .",
    "we will concentrate on the determination of @xmath1 and therefore on the determination of the z lineshape parameters at lep .",
    "at lep , an integrated luminosity of 110 @xmath7 per experiment has been accumulated at the z peak and about 40 @xmath7 off peak , mostly at @xmath8  gev .",
    "about 4 million hadronic and 0.5 million leptonic z decays have been collected by each of the four lep experiments .",
    "this large sample allows a precise determination of the z boson properties : the z mass @xmath3 , the z width @xmath9 , the total hadronic cross section at the pole @xmath10 and the ratio of hadronic to leptonic pole cross sections @xmath11 .",
    "+ these parameters have the advantage of being almost uncorrelated :    * @xmath3 is determined by the position of the peak and therefore depends on the absolute energy scale .",
    "its uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty on the lep energy which is about 1.5  mev@xcite .",
    "* @xmath9 is determined by the width of the z resonance and therefore by peak and off peak relative cross section measurements .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath9 comes mainly from uncorrelated errors on the off peak energy measurement ( @xmath121.5  mev@xcite ) and from off peak statistics .",
    "* @xmath10 is determined by the height of the resonance and is derived from the measurement of the hadronic cross section .",
    "the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the selections are typically of the order of @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , for each experiment@xcite .",
    "the error on @xmath10 is dominated by the theoretical uncertainty on the luminosity which is @xmath15 .",
    "note that a recent study on the theoretical precision of the lep luminosity@xcite will lead to a reduction of this error to @xmath16 .",
    "* @xmath17 is determined by the measurement of the leptonic and hadronic cross sections .",
    "since @xmath17 is a ratio , the uncertainty arising from the luminosity cancels and thus the uncertainty on @xmath17 comes only from the statistical and systematic errors in the @xmath18 event selections which will be discussed in section  [ sec : als ] .",
    "c    the lowest order diagrams involved in the process @xmath18 are shown in figure [ fig : eeff ] .",
    "the cross section is the sum of the z exchange , the @xmath19 exchange and their interference @xmath20 the cross section due to the z exchange is parametrised with a breit - wigner in a model independent way using @xmath3 , @xmath9 , and the z partial widths @xmath21 @xmath22 the photon contribution is taken from qed @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of colours for quarks and 1 for leptons .",
    "the interference term contains combinations of the couplings of the fermions to the z and their charge , which can not be expressed in terms of the z parameters used in equation  [ eq : sig_z ] and are included in the @xmath25 parameter @xmath26 since the interference term is expected to be small it is usually set to the standard model value introducing a small model dependence in the fit .",
    "+ the effect of initial state radiation is taken into account in the fitting procedure through its convolution with the born cross section .",
    ".__average line shape parameters from the results of the four lep experiments .",
    "_ _ [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath17 and @xmath9 both allow to determine @xmath1 with the same experimental precision should decrease from @xmath27 to about @xmath28 with the decrease of the theoretical error on the luminosity@xcite but @xmath10 will still be less powerful than @xmath17 to determine @xmath1 . ] but @xmath9 varies rapidly with @xmath5 introducing an additional uncertainty if no constraint on @xmath5 is used whereas the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath17 almost cancels in the ratio of the hadronic to leptonic widths .",
    "therefore @xmath17 is the most sensitive to @xmath1 and allows to determine @xmath1 without any assumption on the higgs mass .",
    "+   + one should note that @xmath17 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 all depend on @xmath29 through @xmath30 and that @xmath31 is fixed to its standard model value in order to extract @xmath1 . however , since @xmath32 is very sensitive to new physics through the @xmath33 vertex corrections its value may deviate from standard model expectation .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath32 is shown in figure [ fig : rb ] and is in agreement within 1.8@xmath34 with the sm prediction for the direct top mass measurement @xmath35  gev/@xmath36@xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath6 is used in the following .",
    "+   + * the measurement of @xmath17 * + as already discussed in section  [ sec : zline ] , the uncertainty on @xmath17 is dominated by the dilepton statistical and systematic experimental errors .",
    "the preliminary measurements of the 4 lep experiments @xcite presented in jerusalem  97 are shown in figure  [ fig : rl_lep ] .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is @xmath37 for each lep experiment .",
    "the systematic uncertainty from the hadronic channel is of the order of @xmath38 and an effort is being made to reduce the systematic error from the leptonic channel .",
    "+    a new measurement of @xmath17 using aleph data with a global dilepton selection allows to reduce the systematic uncertainty from the leptonic channel to @xmath38 .",
    "the dilepton selection has to be inclusive in order to be compared to the theoretical prediction .",
    "therefore this selection includes also four fermion final state events of the type @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a lepton and v is a low invariant mass pair of fermions .",
    "+ first , dileptons are selected with an efficiency of @xmath41 inside the detector acceptance and background from @xmath42 , @xmath43 and cosmic events is reduced to the level of @xmath44 .",
    "all the systematic uncertainties are at the level of few @xmath45",
    ". then the lepton flavour separation is performed inside the dilepton sample so that the systematic uncertainties are anti - correlated between 2 lepton species and that no additional uncertainty is introduced on @xmath17 .",
    "this separation is needed in order to identify @xmath46 events for which the t - channel contribution has to be subtracted .",
    "this subtraction is performed using theoretical calculation described in @xcite .",
    "the theoretical error assigned to the subtraction is @xmath38 of the @xmath46 s - channel cross section@xcite .",
    "+ the value of @xmath17 obtained with this new selection is @xmath47 the relative error on @xmath17 is reduced from @xmath48 ( 1997 value ) to @xmath49 ( this measurement ) .",

    "the small dependence with the higgs and the top masses is also parametrised with zfitter @xmath54 the values of @xmath17 obtained with this parametrisation agree with zfitter prediction at the level of few @xmath55 for any value of @xmath1 in [ 0.100,0.130 ] , @xmath6 in [ 150,200 ]  gev / c@xmath52 and @xmath5 in [ 60,1000 ]  gev / c@xmath52 .",

    "+ the preliminary lep combined value or @xmath17 ( jerusalem 97 , see ref.@xcite ) is shown in figure [ fig : rl_lep ] and leads to @xmath57 in an overall fit using all the information from lep1 and slc data ( cross sections and asymmetries ) the value of @xmath1 and of @xmath5 are simultaneously constrained ( see section  [ sec : mhiggs ] ) , the fitted value of @xmath1 is @xmath58 the experimental error is reduced from 0.004 ( in equation  [ eq : fittorl ] ) to 0.003 because @xmath9 and @xmath10 are used in this last fit , and the 0.002 error from the higgs mass disappears since @xmath5 is also constrained .",
    "this value of @xmath1 is lower than in the fit to @xmath17 alone ( equation  [ eq : fittorl ] ) because @xmath9 prefers lower values of @xmath1 and the low fitted value of @xmath5 ( 66  gev / c@xmath52 ) brings @xmath1 down by @xmath120.002 ( in the fit to @xmath17 the value @xmath51  gev / c@xmath52 was used ) .",

    "2 .   then lep1 and sld data and the measurement of @xmath70 from @xmath71n experiments are used to determine top quark and w masses indirectly ( second column of table  [ tbl : fit ] ) .",
    "the good agreement with the direct measurements @xmath72  gev / c@xmath52@xcite and @xmath73  gev / c@xmath52 @xcite provides a test of the standard model .",
    "all electroweak measurements including the direct @xmath6 and @xmath74 measurement are used to obtain the best constraint on @xmath5 ( last column of table  [ tbl : fit ] ) .",

    "since @xmath5 is mainly constrained by the measurement of @xmath60 , new data from slc will improve this constraint .",
