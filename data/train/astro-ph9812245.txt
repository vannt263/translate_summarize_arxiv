    "the pair of interacting galaxies ngc  4410a / b belongs to a group of 11 members ( hummel et al .",
    "1986 , hereafter hkg86 ) which are located behind the virgo cluster .",
    "it consists of a peculiar sab ( ngc  4410a ) ( thuan & sauvage 1992 ) and an e galaxy ( ngc  4410b ) ( hkg86 ) located in east - west direction and separated by 187 ( 8.8 kpc at a distance of 97 mpc ) ( mazzarella & boroson 1993 , hereafter mb93 ) .",

    "s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 this leads to a distance of 97 mpc . in this paper",
    "we apply the latter value to all distance - dependent parameters , like e.g. luminosities etc .",
    "a distance of 97 mpc for ngc  4410 results in an absolute length scale of 470 pc  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "hkg86 found a spatial coincidence of the western optical component ngc  4410a with a radio point source of luminosity @xmath1110@xmath12 erg s@xmath2 embedded in a strong , extended radio source around ngc  4410a with a total radio luminosity @xmath117 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the phenomenon of interaction between galaxies is closely related to the occurrence of starbursts ( sbs ) : a large fraction of interacting galaxies ( @xmath070% ) exhibits typical characteristica of sbs ( bushouse 1986 ) and vice versa .",
    "it is also striking that the majority of infrared - bright galaxies shows evidence for recent interactions as indicated by the presence of close neighbours , or by their disturbed morphology and tidal tails ( joseph et al .",
    "1984 ; lonsdale et al . 1984 ; telesco 1988 ) .",
    "the fraction of mergers increases drastically in the infrared luminosity range @xmath13 from 10@xmath14(12% ) to 10@xmath15(95% ) ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "although a large ir luminosity is not necessarily a tracer for enhanced star formation , it is one of the typical features for sb galaxies .",
    "norman & scoville ( 1988 ) demonstrated that gas inflow from the galactic disk toward the central region , as required for building a central sb , will be triggered by a non - axialsymmetric gravitational potential like in interacting galaxies .",
    "they argued that perturbed orbits of gas clouds caused by an encounter lead to enhanced cloud collisions within the galactic central region and trigger the formation of massive stars .",
    "an alternative model for triggering a central sb was given by jog & das ( 1992 ) and jog & solomon ( 1992 ) .",
    "the infall of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) into an intercloud medium with a higher mean pressure in the central region drives a radiative shock into the gmcs and ignites the sb .",
    "the inflow of gas from the galactic disk is not only required for a central sb but also for fuelling an agn .",
    "it is still under debate whether sbs are progenitors of agn ( norman & scoville 1988 ) or whether both are different physical processes .",
    "weedman ( 1983 ) proposed that if a large number of massive stars form fast in a small central volume , the compact stellar remnants from these could act as accretors .",
    "also the stellar dynamical merging of a dense cluster of massive stellar remnants would plausibly form a blackhole nucleus ( rees 1984 ) .",
    "the nuclei of several nearby galaxies , like ngc  1068 , ngc 1097 , and ngc  7469 , can be resolved into a central agn and a circumnuclear sb ring ( keel 1985 ; prez - olea & colina 1996 , hereafter pc96 ) .",
    "some host galaxies of quasars also exhibit evidence for sbs , such as 3c48 ( stockton 1990 ) .    assuming an evolution from starbursts to agns during the interaction of galaxies one would expect more agns with the age of the merger process .",
    "recent observations of ultraluminous ir galaxies with the infrared satellite iso however do not show any obvious tendency of an increasing fraction of agns within interacting galaxies with advanced merging process ( lutz et al .",
    "1998 ; genzel et al .",
    "half of the observed galaxies reveal both an agn and starburst activity .",
    "it seems more likely that more local and shorter term conditions like time - dependent compression of the circumnuclear interstellar gas , the accretion rate onto the central black hole , and the associate radiation efficiency determine agn or starburst dominated luminosities .    in this paper",
    "we present the spectral and imaging x - ray properties of ngc  4410 observed by the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and high resolution imager ( hri ) , respectively .",
    "we are able to resolve the two optical components in the rosat hri image .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we are considering the x - ray observations in general , detecting and trying to identify the emergent x - ray sources in the field and discussing the data reduction . in sect .",
    "3 we concentrate on ngc  4410 presenting the hri results at first before we study the spectral flux distribution of the pspc data with particular concern of comparison with a sequence of x - ray radiation models .",
    "the results are then discussed in sect .  4 making use of a hst wfpc2 image of ngc  4410a for a geometrical consideration of its inclination .",
    "the data presented in this paper were taken with the hri and the pspc detectors on board of the x - ray satellite rosat .",
    "this x - ray telescope is operating in the energy range of 0.1 to 2.4 kev .",
    "the spatial resolutions of the hri is 17 .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) of this detector at the optical axis in combination with the telescope is 3 .",

    "ngc  4410 was observed on june 28 - 30 , 1993 with the rosat pspc detector for a total effective exposure time of 23.4 ksec .",

    "the source photons were extracted from a circular area of 92  around the central source and corrected for telescope vignetting and detector dead - time .",
    "the spectrum of the source was binned according to a signal - to - noise ratio of 8 . for the background correction we selected three uncontaminated circular areas close to ngc  4410 with radii of 86 , 101  and 141 .",
    "the background contributes an x - ray flux of ( 1.36@xmath160.27 ) cts arcsec@xmath17 in the rosat bandpass . in order to fit a model spectrum to the pspc data we used the x - ray spectral - fitting software package xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "our rosat hri observations have been taken between june 27 and july 1 , 1995 with a total effective exposure time of 36.7 ksec which led to 152@xmath1624 counts for the central source associated with ngc  4410 .",

    "the 870 background corrected counts of the central source detected with the pspc in the energy range of 0.1 - 2.4 kev were binned in order to achieve a constant signal - to - noise ratio of 8 . to fit the observed pspc x - ray spectrum we apply different models of absorbed emission spectra including a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum ( bs ) , the spectrum of an optically thin thermal plasma in collisional equilibrium ( rs ) as calculated by raymond & smith ( 1977 ) and a power - law spectrum ( po ) with a photon energy distribution @xmath37 , as well as several combinations of those .",
    "the absorption of the spectra depends on the hydrogen column density @xmath38 between the source and the observer . as a first - order estimate and as a lower limit of @xmath38",
    "we use the galactic foreground value in the direction of ngc  4410 .",
    "this value for @xmath38 amounts to 1.73 cm@xmath17 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the model fits for the x - ray emission to the observation are shown in table  2 .",
    "usually the rs model is applied under the assumption of solar abundances ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "reasonably , this is not an ideal approach because expanding sn ejecta should contain the nucleosynthesis products of their massive stellar progenitors .",
    "for this reason we use two different sets of chemical abundances . beside the classical model with solar abundances",
    "we fit one with enhanced abundances of sne according to the yields by woosley & weaver ( 1985 ) , but integrated over all massive stars between 10 and 100 m@xmath21 and with a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the main uncertainty to fit the data comes in by the value of the hydrogen column density @xmath38 . in each model , except the combinations of rs+po and the single component models bs and po , the free parameter @xmath38 turns out to become much too low for the best fit .",
    "for the single thermal model rs it is not possible to fit both , the soft and the hard part of the spectrum reasonably without an unrealistically low value of @xmath38 .",
    "this is also true for the combined two temperature plasma model rs+rs(ww ) . the best fit results in an unrealistically low @xmath38 value of 0.35 cm@xmath17 .",
    "for the same model with solar abundances rs+rs(sol ) , the best fit yields @xmath38 = 0.45 cm@xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the plasma temperature of more than 3 k for the second component is abnormally high for halo gas .",
    "this temperature may only be reached for gas in the central regions of starburst galaxies , for example ngc 253 ( ptak et al .",
    "1997 ) and m82 ( mathews & doane 1994 ) . in the case of fixing the column density to the galactic value , the resulting plasma temperatures of 1.7 k and 8.8 k for rs+rs(sol ) and 0.9 k and 9.3 k for rs+rs(ww ) are much more reasonable . but both fits to the observed spectra are much worse ( see table  2 ) .    in the case of fitting the observation with a single po the column density of 3.4",
    "cm@xmath17 becomes plausible because of an expected additional absorption within ngc  4410 .",
    "the photon index of 2.39@xmath160.09 is in agreement with the results from turner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and mulchaey et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , who found a mean value for seyfert1 and seyfert2 galaxies of @xmath5 = 2.4 . comparing all these single - component models the model po and bs provide the best fits to the observation .",
    "the fits are plotted in fig .",
    "6 .    the best fit by far for the whole observed spectrum can be reached by applying a two - component model which combines a thermal and a power - law spectrum ( rs+po ) with a photon index of 2.17@xmath160.10 and a plasma temperature of ( 9.3@xmath161.0 ) k ( see fig .",
    "9 ) . nevertheless , the fit becomes worse for applying a higher value for @xmath38 than the galactic one .",
    "the combined po+rs fit yields the best result with an absorption corrected luminosity of ( 3.91@xmath160.55 ) erg  s@xmath2 for the assumed distance of 97  mpc .    under the assumption , that the nonthermal emission originates from a central active nucleus heavily obscured by dust and gas , and that hot plasma has expanded into the outer parts of ngc  4410a , we fit the rs+po model with different column density values for each component .",
    "one would expect a column density @xmath39 for the less obscured plasma outflow and a much higher @xmath40 for the agn because of the intrinsic absorption within the ngc  4410 nucleus . while we apply @xmath41 = @xmath42 = 1.73 cm@xmath17 for the rs component , @xmath40 for the po component",
    "is set to 3.1 cm@xmath17 .",
    "this yields the best fit for a lower plasma temperature of 1.0 k and a very steep power - law for the central agn with @xmath5 = 4.24 ( see  fig .",
    "11 ) . in the very soft range",
    "( 0.1 - 0.3 kev ) the spectrum is determined by the intrisically unobscured rs component .",
    "raising the absorption for the po component prohibits its contribution to the soft spectral range , which means that the total x - ray flux there has to originate from the hot ionized gas . as",
    "a consequence the temperature of the plasma is almost one order of magnitude lower than in the rs+po model with only one common absorption .",
    "the hard spectrum @xmath430.5 kev originates completely from the nonthermal component .",
    "nevertheless the photon index is unplausibly steep .",
    "the hri image strongly suggests a twofold spatial correlation between the x - ray and the radio emission : we have a compact central emission peak apparently coinciding with ngc  4410a and a diffuse halo slightly elongated about 10  toward the southeast .",
    "subtraction of the central point - like source from the total x - ray emission enables us to unveil a clear extention in this direction . because of the asymmetrical elongation and the spatial correlation in the x - ray and radio flux we are convinced not to be mistaken by an artefact .",
    "furthermore , the flux ratio of 0.34@xmath160.05 from this feature compared to the total flux corresponds to the best fitting model for the observed spectrum , a two - component model , combining a thermal raymond - smith spectrum and a power - law spectrum . as a hypothesis",
    "we assume that the thermal emission originates from an expanding x - ray halo gas with a plasma temperature of a few 10@xmath44 k whose expulsion is driven by a central engine ( sb + agn ) .",
    "the se elongation of the emission contours could be caused by two effects : + ( 1 ) if the pec  sab galaxy ngc  4410a is seen at moderate inclination , a circumnuclear superbubble or a bipolar outflow is visible in soft x - ray which expands vertically to both sides out of the galactic disk only the part in front of the hi disk .",
    "x - ray emission in the rosat band originating from gas outflowing into the reverse halo hemisphere is absorbed by cold gas in the disk of ngc  4410 .",
    "this fact also accounts for the low n@xmath45 that is required from the best model fit and is lacking of any additional contribution to the galactic foreground value .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the x - ray halo gas is exposed to the tidal force of the companion galaxy ngc  4410b .    in order to decide which of the two effects causes",
    "the deformation of the x - ray halo , information about the inclination angle of ngc  4410a is necessary .",
    "12 shows the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) wfpc2 image of the central part of ngc  4410a in the v ( 5843  ) broad band filter taken from the hubble space telescope archive .",
    "one can discern the nucleus , a bright emission region at the lower left , and a line of additional smaller bright knots at the left . at the right - hand side of the nucleus a long tidal arm probably caused by",
    "the interaction is clearly visible . since the morphology in this image leads to a very low inclination , we prefer the second explanation of an interaction - induced deformation of the x - ray halo",
    ". however , the hst image suggests an additional possibility , namely , that the bright emission region at the lower left is a starburst region , and that the extended part of the x - ray contours originates from this region .",
    "the x - ray contours reveal a faint ridge toward ngc  4410b ( @xmath8 1.4 erg s@xmath2 ) which has only a very faint corresponding x - ray counterpart centrally of ngc  4410b ( @xmath8 3.8 erg s@xmath2 ) as indication of any activity in or around the nucleus of ngc  4410b .",
    "the non - detection of a similar radio emission admits at best a radioquiet agn .",
    "as one can see in table  2 the derived values for the x - ray luminosity are all of the same order of  34 erg s@xmath2 and independent of the applied model . from this point of view",
    "it is not possible to distinguish between the different models .",
    "the two most acceptable models with reasonable values for n@xmath45 are the two - component combination rs+po and the single - component po model , respectively .",
    "although the photon index of @xmath5 = 2.39@xmath160.09 of the single po model is in good agreement with observed values for low luminousity agns ( turner et al .",
    "1993 ; mulchaey 1993 ) , it is obvious that the observed x - ray spectrum of ngc  4410 can not be fitted properly by a single po model but requires an additional component as can be seen in table  2 and by comparing fig .  6 with fig .",
    "the rs+po model for the x - ray source leads to a luminosity of the thermal component @xmath46 = ( 1.35@xmath160.19 ) erg s@xmath2 ( 35% of the total x - ray luminosity ) .",
    "nevertheless , the x - ray luminosity can vary by a factor of 4 because of the uncertainty of the distance to the source . to compare the derived properties of ngc  4410 with theoretical calculations , we apply the following model : we assume a central sb to drive an expanding superbubble .",
    "the central source injects mechanical energy since a time @xmath47 at a constant rate @xmath48 by sequential supernova explosions into the bubble .",
    "the supersonic expansion leads to a shock front and is heating the ambient gas . assuming a homogeneous density of this ambient gas would lead to a spherically expanding bubble , as calculated by maclow & mccray ( 1988 ) .",
    "this model , however , does not correspond to the realistic conditions of a sb in a disk galaxy . because of the vertically decreasing gas density the superbubble forms a `` chimney '' and blows out of the galactic disk into the halo by a bipolar outflow ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) .",
    "the dynamics , x - ray emission and disk - halo interaction of these outflows are modelled under different conditions of ambient disk gas density , halo gas density , energetic input into the superbubble , and expansion time of the superbubble in a number of papers ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1986 ; tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; maclow et al .",
    "1989 ; suchkov et al .",
    "1994 , hereafter s94 ; michaelis et al .",
    "s94 found that the soft x - ray emission of the suberbubble in the range of ( 0.12.2 ) kev primarily originates from the shock - heated halo and disk gas with temperatures of 10@xmath24 ",
    "10@xmath4 k , rather than from the supernova material itself .",
    "depending on the density of the disk and halo gas , the scale - height of the disk , and the energy deposition rate from the sb , the morphology of the bipolar outflow varies in structural parameters : opening angle within the disk , radius of the chimney , vertical extension of the superbubble , and ratio of the two last properties .",
    "independent of these different conditions , the models always achieve a bipolar morphology .",
    "s94 derived an analytic expression for the shell x - ray luminosity in the ( 0.12.2 ) kev band :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the mechanical input energy in units of 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath2 , @xmath51 is the particle density of the halo gas in units of 0.01 @xmath30 , and @xmath52 is the expansion time of the superbubble in units of 10@xmath53 yr .    from the hri observation we can estimate a maximum expansion of the outflowing gas into the halo of  10 , scaling to 4.7 kpc at a distance of 97 mpc .",
    "the models of tomisaka & ikeuchi ( 1986 ) , tomisaka & ikeuchi ( 1988 ) , maclow et al . ( 1989 ) and s94 reveal chimney radii within the galactic disk between 200 pc and 600 pc .",
    "the much more extended x - ray emission observed in ngc  4410a can therefore only originate from the outflow into the less dense galactic halo where it can expand in each direction .",
    "this involves that the sb has to be old enough in order to account for the escape of the expanding superbubble from the disk into the halo .",
    "that means a lower limit of @xmath54 4 myr for the expansion time ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ) .",
    "we estimate the mechanical energy input by the starburst into the superbubble from the emitted h@xmath55 radiation using the shock model by binette et al .",
    "they calculated the radiative cooling mechanism of shock - heated gas , emitting optical line radiation , and found that @xmath56 10@xmath57 . with @xmath58 = 6.6 erg s@xmath2 for ngc  4410 ( mb93 )",
    "this leads to @xmath59 6 erg s@xmath2 . applying 10@xmath60 erg for the energy release per and taking into account",
    "that roughly only 20% is converted into mechanical luminosity we derive a rate of @xmath01.0 yr@xmath2 .    under the simplified consideration of a spherically expanding gas",
    "one can estimate its density . with the scaling factor of the rs model and setting the electron density equal to the hydrogen density",
    "we get the following expression for the electron density of the hot gas :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the scaling factor , @xmath6 is the distance to the source , @xmath63 is the radius of the superbubble and @xmath64 is a filling factor taking into account that the hot gas is not distributed homogeneously but broken up into separate bubbles . with",

    "an insight on whether ngc  4410 and its derived structures are somehow typical for close encounters , we compare the derived x - ray luminosity in the rosat band with other disturbed and isolated sb galaxies . the peculiar galaxy ngc  2782 e.g. is thought to be a merger of two disk galaxies of unequal mass and has @xmath46 = 4 erg s@xmath2 ( schulz et al .",

    "-0.70 and -0.36 for ngc 1097 , ngc  1068 and ngc  7469 , respectively . if we concider the fraction of h@xmath55 luminosity from the sb in these galaxies , and assume that 90% of the total h@xmath55 luminosity originates from the sb within ngc  4410a , @xmath58 would result in 5.9 erg s@xmath2 and log(@xmath68 ) = + 0.36 , which is quite high compared to the sample analysed by pc96",
    "we observed the interacting pair of galaxies ngc  4410 with the rosat hri and pspc .",
    "spectral investigations of ngc  4410 suggest that the integral x - ray emission ( @xmath46 = 3.9 erg s@xmath2 ) can be decomposed into a thermal component ( described by a rs spectrum ) and a component from the agn ( described by a power - law spectrum ) .",
    "the hri image reveals an extended x - ray halo related to ngc  4410a with an extension of 10  from the nucleus of ngc  4410a to the southeast .",
    "combining spatial and spectral informations reveals an x - ray luminosity of the halo gas of @xmath46 = 1.3 erg s@xmath2 ( 1/3 of the total x - ray emission ) . the companion galaxy ngc  4410b houses only a very faint central point - like source below the 3@xmath18 level , corresponding to an upper limit of 3.8 erg s@xmath2 for the x - ray luminosity .    as a reasonable model we can assume that the tidal interaction in the pair of galaxies ngc  4410 has two effects on the one partner , the face - on pec  sab galaxy ngc  4410a : + ( 1 )",
    "a central monster is either formed due to this interaction or has already existed before and is now fed by infalling gas during the merging event , producing agn signatures .",
    "evidence for an existing agn comes from the rosat x - ray spectrum supported by the spatially correlated radio emission .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the merging process has ignited a nuclear sb ejecting an x - ray gas into the halo .",
    "due to the tidal forces of ngc  4410b , the x - ray halo of ngc  4410a is deformed toward its neighbouring galaxy , either directly by gravitational forces or indirectly , originating from a decentred starburst region as a consequence of the merging process .",
    "this system of merging galaxies represents a highly interesting object because it is a close interacting pair where the effects of tidal forces on nuclear activity and sb can be studied in detail with large telescopes .",
    "the hst wfpc2 image of ngc  4410a suggests a possible relation between the deformed x - ray halo and a bright emission region near the nucleus .",
    "with rosat imaging it is not possible to distinguish between the nucleus and the bright emission region resolved by hst .",
    "further spectroscopic observations of this region and additional infrared imaging could help answering the question of the exact origin of the x - ray emission .",
