    "this paper describes the results of an ab initio quantum mechanical study of the absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide photoexcited with the ultraviolet ( uv ) light between 120 nm and 160 nm and offers vibronic assignments of the diffuse absorption bands .",
    "a brief account of this work has already been published.@xcite the potential energy surfaces ( pess ) used in these calculations are described in the preceding paper ( termed paper i).@xcite    photodissociation of carbon dioxide is of considerable importance for atmospheric and planetary chemistry .",
    "co@xmath0 is the second common trace gas in the earth atmosphere and one of the main products of the fossil fuel burning .",
    "its emissions continue to grow@xcite despite considerable effort to mitigate climate change.@xcite uv photodissociation destroys co@xmath0 with a unit quantum yield , and in the upper atmosphere , this destruction channel is dominant .",
    "photolysis , shifted into the uv / visible range via preheating of co@xmath0 , has been used in solar based schemes of conversion of atmospheric co@xmath0 into fuel.@xcite uv photochemistry of carbon dioxide controls chemical processes in the upper layers of the co@xmath0 based atmospheres of mars and venus.@xcite accurate predictions of the low temperature uv absorption cross sections are required to improve the existing photochemical models of their atmospheres , and are also relevant for the models of the atmosphere of titan,@xcite which contains co@xmath0 as a minor constituent .",
    "finally , photodissociation shares its activated complex  the highly electronically and vibrationally excited co@xmath0  with another reaction , in which @xmath2 collisions produce carbon monoxide , the second most abundant molecule in interstellar clouds.@xcite    absorption spectrum of co@xmath0 in the uv range is studied experimentally since the beginning of the 20th century.@xcite figure [ spec1](a ) gives an overview between 220 nm and 105 nm .",
    "carbon dioxide is transparent down to about 220 nm ( 6.20ev ) .",
    "below 220 nm , the absorption starts with a very weak progression of narrow lines.@xcite at 112.1 nm ( 11.08ev ) , a strong absorption band is observed , which is assigned@xcite to the optically allowed transition to the rydberg state @xmath3 ; this band is the first in a series of rydberg transtions at shorter wavelengths [ not shown in fig .",

    "magnified view of this spectral interval is given in fig.[spec1](b ) .",
    "each band exhibits irregular diffuse structures superimposed on broad structureless background .",
    "the vibronic origin of the diffuse structures and the dissociation mechanisms in these two bands are subjects of this paper .",
    "previous analysis established key electronic states in the observed spectrum.@xcite these are the singlet valence states @xmath4 and @xmath5 , properties and topographies of the global pess of which are discussed in paper i. it is customary to give electronic assignment using the @xmath6 labels , appropriate for linear co@xmath0 , namely @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , with the low energy band at 148 nm assigned to the @xmath9 state , and the high energy 133 nm band to the @xmath8 state.@xcite however , the interstate vibronic couplings calculated in paper i are strong rendering such zeroth order diabatic labels somewhat problematic .",
    "vibrational progressions are isolated using solely line spacings .",
    "for the stronger lines near 133 nm , one bending or two stretching progressions are offered as alternative tentative assignments.@xcite the weaker band near 148 nm is presumed to involve strong bending excitations .",
    "this assignment is based on the analysis of dixon@xcite who characterized the upper state in the 148 nm transition as bent ( two - dimensional contour maps of the lowest two bent excited states @xmath10 and @xmath11 are shown in figs .  9 and 13 of paper i ) .",
    "however , the intervals between diffuse peaks are strongly perturbed and rather irregular in both absorption bands : a unequivocal assignment is difficult without a convincing spectroscopic model or accurate dynamics calculations .",
    "irregularities in the peak spacings and intensity distributions are due to strong vibronic interactions , rooted in the symmetry properties of the excited valence states . in the near linear franck - condon ( fc ) region ,",
    "vibronic effects can be grouped into three classes : * ( 1 ) * the rotoelectronic renner - teller ( rt ) effect involves @xmath12 and @xmath13 components of the orbitally degenerate @xmath8 or @xmath9 state .",

    "the influence of the carbene - type oco on the diffuse 148 nm band , uncovered in the above calculations , suggests that a systematic analysis of this band has to include the first four @xmath12 and @xmath13 states properly diabatized and fully interacting at multiple bent cis .      the spectrum of the state @xmath329 ( @xmath221 at linearity ) is shown in fig .  [ spec3 ] .",
    "it stretches from 65000@xmath167 to about 83000@xmath167 and consists of several series of narrow peaks .",
    "all vibrational states , excited in this transition , lie below @xmath330@xmath167 , i.e. the threshold energy of the channel @xmath331 with which the state @xmath221 correlates .",
    "predissociation is purely non - adiabatic and therefore inhibited in these calculations . because of the extremely small tdm @xmath38",
    ", the intensity of this band , excited in a perpendicular transition from @xmath34 , does not exceed @xmath332@xmath333 .",
    "the frequencies of the bending , symmetric and antisymmetric stretching modes are @xmath334@xmath167 , @xmath335@xmath167 , and @xmath336@xmath167 , respectively .",
    "the vibrational ground state @xmath337 lies at 64220@xmath167 but remains invisible in a perpendicular transition in which only states with odd number of antisymmetric stretch quanta @xmath296 are excited .",
    "most intense lines in the spectrum belong to one of the three main progressions , assigned by visual inspection of the corresponding wave functions , although excitations are easily predictable from the fc geometries .",
    "the state @xmath221 is linear , the angular dependence of the tdm @xmath38 is weak , and the bending vibration remains unexcited .",
    "in contrast , the equilibrium bond lengths , @xmath338 , are substantially extended as compared to the equilibrium in @xmath34 at @xmath339 , with the implication that the spectrum is built on stretching excitations .",
    "the nodal patterns of the vibrational eigenfunctions clearly demonstrate that the three main progressions , @xmath340 , @xmath341 , and @xmath342 , involve consecutive excitations of the symmetric stretch mode accompanied by one , three , or five quanta of the antisymmetric stretch .",
    "maximum intensity in each progression is reached for the same @xmath343 , and the intensity distributions around the maximum are approximately bell shaped .",
    "this paper analyzes the absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide in the wavelength range 120 nm  160 nm by means of quantum mechanical calculations using pess of five singlet valence electronic states and their coordinate dependent tdm vectors with the ground electronic state , constructed as described in paper i. the main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "the uv spectrum of five valence states , calculated for @xmath1k via boltzmann averaging of optical transitions from many initial rotational states , reproduces the experimental two - band spectral envelope , the positions of the absorption maxima , their fwhms , peak intensities , and frequencies of diffuse structures in each band .",
    "the two absorption bands have been assigned at several levels of graining",
    ". electronic assignment , reflecting the strong ht effect and influenced by the vibronic interactions at cis , is given in the adiabatic representation ( low energy band : bent states @xmath200 ; high energy band : linear states @xmath199 ; gap between the two bands : state @xmath329 ) .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular components of the full spectrum are isolated .",
    "the parallel transition , the rt coupling in which is suppressed for excitations from the ground vibrational state in @xmath34 , is shown to be dominant for all but the highest photon energies .",
    "finally , individual diffuse structures are assigned using multicomponent wave functions of metastable resonance states .",
    "_ in the high energy band _ , the main progressions correspond to consecutive excitations of the pseudorotational motion around the closed loop of the ci seam ; progressions differ in the number of nodes along the radial mode perpendicular to the closed seam",
    ". systematic frequency growth in the pseudorotational progressions is interpreted as a spectroscopic hallmark of the closed seam .",
    "4 .   _ in the low energy band _ , the diffuse peaks , associated with bending excitations in the states @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are analyzed in both parallel and perpendicular transitions .",
    "calculations reveal a dramatic difference in the spectra of the two states . the perpendicular band ( mainly @xmath11 ) ,",
    "bending progressions in which are nearly equidistant , is rather regular .",
    "in contrast , bending excitations in the parallel band ( mainly @xmath10 ) , are very anharmonic and irregular .",
    "this difference is interpreted as a manifestation of the carbene - type cyclic oco minimum in the pes of the @xmath10 state .",
    "the present study focuses on spectroscopic aspects of the uv photodynamics of co@xmath0",
    ". mechanisms of photodissociation are discussed only insofar as they become apparent in the analysis of the absorption spectrum .",
    "this piece will be completed in the discussion of photofragment distributions which will be published separately .",
    "however , preliminary conclusions can be deduced from the density distributions of resonance wave functions @xmath197 calculated and discussed above . of interest here",
    "are the @xmath236 components of @xmath197 as depicted for example in fig .",
    "[ resleb ] .",
    "although useless in establishing the vibrational assignments , they rather clearly illustrate the dissociation path taken by the molecule once it arrives in a bent adiabatic state .",
    "because of cis in linear co@xmath0 , the inner regions of states @xmath10 and @xmath11 are separated from the dissociation asymptotes by barriers . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 potentials along @xmath48 in the direction of global bent equilibria are barrierless .",
    "this directional anisotropy is reflected in the probability density in the right panel of fig.[resleb ] : the wave function traces out a path leading from the fc region to smaller angles ; hardly any probability is found along the linear dissociation path .",
    "substantial extension of the co bond , seen in the left panel of fig.[resleb ] , occurs predominantly in bent molecular configurations with @xmath344 .",
    "this shape is representative of the @xmath236 or @xmath313 components of @xmath197 both below the ci energy ( where the bent states are directly accessed ) and above the ci energy ( where they become populated indirectly via the ci funnels at linearity ) ."
