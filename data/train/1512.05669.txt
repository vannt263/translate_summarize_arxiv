    "the relationship between mathematics and physics at a basic level is of much interest to many .",
    "it was most clearly raised some time ago by wigner in a paper on `` the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences '' @xcite .",
    "this work resulted in much discussion about the relationship @xcite .",
    "there was also the suggestion that physics is mathematics @xcite .",
    "these ideas led to work towards a coherent theory of mathematics and physics together in which physics and mathematics are treated together as a coherent whole @xcite .",
    "the origin of continuing work on this topic @xcite was based on gauge theory considerations .",
    "the mathematical setup for these theories consists of vector spaces associated with each point of a space time manifold .",
    "unitary connections between these spaces express the concept , based on work by yang and mills @xcite , of the freedom of choice of bases in vector spaces .",
    "this work is based on an extension of the freedom of basis choice in vector spaces to the freedom of number value choice for the underlying scalar fields .",
    "the choice freedom is based on the observation that the value of a number at one space time point does not determine the value of the same number at another point .",
    "this results in the extension of gauge theory to include separate scalar fields associated with the vector spaces at each space time point .",
    "this localization of scalar fields follows from the representation of mathematical systems , such as vector spaces and scalar fields , as mathematical structures and relations between the structures @xcite .",
    "structures consist of a base set , a few basic operations and relations , and none or a few constants .",
    "they satisfy axioms relevant to the system type being considered .",
    "it can be shown that , for each number type , there exist many different structures that differ from one another by scaling factors .",
    "it follows that base set elements , as numbers , do not have intrinsic , structure independent values .",
    "they have different values in different scaled structures .",
    "this fact and the choice freedom of number values at different locations results in the existence of separate local scaled number structures at each point .",
    "the scaling used here is linear in that the sum of two scaled numbers equals the scaling of the sum of the numbers .",
    "this type of scaling has recently been generalized to nonlinear scaling of number structures @xcite .",
    "the additional complexity of this type of scaling makes it difficult to apply it to different areas of physics .",
    "these applications are work for the future .    relations between number structures at different locations are implemented by a scalar scaling field . the value of the field at each location is the scaling factor for the number structure at each point . the field is not unitary as it is the product of a real factor and a phase factor .    in earlier work extension of gauge theory to include the effect of the scaling scalar field was described .",
    "the effect of the scaling field and use of local scaled number structures was extended to briefly describe some other physical and geometric quantities @xcite . in this work",
    "the emphasis is on quantum mechanical quantities for one , two , and multiparticle systems .",
    "the definition of the scaling field is extended to apply to entangled states of two or more particles .",
    "fiber bundles @xcite have been much used in physics .",
    "they have been used to describe gauge theories @xcite and nonrelativistic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the quantum descriptions include an introductory description @xcite , a detailed mathematical development @xcite and descriptions in which symmetry groups and semigroups serve as the base space @xcite .    this paper uses fiber bundles to describe the effect of a scaling scalar field on one , two , and multiparticle quantum systems in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the description includes the effect of the field on multiparticle spatially entangled states .",
    "the plan of the paper is to first describe the scaling of scalar fields and vector spaces .",
    "this is done in the next section .",
    "local representations of these and other structures at each point of a space or space time manifold are conveniently described by use of fiber bundles .",
    "these are described in section [ fb ] .",
    "the bundle fibers are large in that they contain sufficient scaled mathematical structures to describe some aspects of quantum mechanics . in earlier work that was not based on fiber bundles @xcite , mathematical universes or the mathematics available to observers were the equivalent of fibers at different locations .",
    "the scalar scaling field is introduced in the next section on connections .",
    "the field is complex valued since it acts on hilbert spaces and on complex numbers as a scalar base for the hilbert spaces .",
    "section [ qm ] describes some aspects of the use of fiber bundles in quantum mechanics .",
    "the three subsections discuss one , two , and multiparticle particle states .",
    "the discussion includes entangled two and multiparticle states .",
    "the fiber bundles are used to describe a projection of a wave packet onto the bundle fibers .",
    "this is followed by the use of the scaling field connections to map the projected wave packet to a fiber at an arbitrary reference location . without the localization",
    ", the implied space integration of the wave packet amplitudes is undefined .",
    "an expansion of the definition of the connection for single particle states to accommodate two and multiparticle states is described .",
    "the discussion section [ d ] concludes the paper . some justification for the localization of quantum mechanics is given . also coupling and cosmological limitations on the scalar scaling field",
    "are noted .",
    "one begins with the observation that mathematical systems of different types can be represented as different structures @xcite .",
    "a structure consists of a base set of elements and a few basic operations , relations , and constants .",
    "the structure is required to satisfy a set of axioms relevant to the structure type being considered .",
    "in addition there are maps and operations between structures of different types .",
    "examples of such maps are scalar vector multiplication and norms of vectors in vector spaces .",
    "number structures of different types are important examples of scalar structures .",
    "these structures can all be scaled .",
    "the types include the natural numbers , integers , and rational , real , and complex numbers .",
    "in addition mathematical structures that include numbers in their descriptions can also be scaled .",
    "this includes vector spaces , operator algebras , and group representations . here",
    "the discussion will be limited to complex numbers and vector spaces with complex numbers as the associated scalars .    a structure for the complex number field is @xmath0 this structure satisfies the axioms for an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath1 plus axioms for complex conjugation @xcite .    in order to describe scaling it is important to distinguish the base set elements of a structure from the values or meaning they have in a structure . by themselves ,",
    "base set elements have no intrinsic value .",
    "the values they get depend on the structure containing them . here many different complex number structures that differ by scaling factors will be considered .",
    "it follows that a value of a base set element will depend on the scaling factor for the structure containing it .    to describe this in more detail ,",
    "it is useful to distinguish two types of structures : a value structure and different representation structures . for complex numbers the structure @xmath2 of eq .",
    "[ bc ] represents a complex number value structure .",
    "the abstract elements of the base set , @xmath3 , and constants , @xmath1 and @xmath4 have meaning as number values . the four field operations and complex conjugation also have meaning .",
    "elements of @xmath3 will always be referred to as complex number values .",
    "this distinguishes them from elements of the base set of representation structures .",
    "they are referred to as complex numbers .",
    "also structures are distinguished from base sets by an overline .",
    "for example @xmath3 is the base set of the structure @xmath5    the many complex number representation structures are distinguished from the value structures by the scaling factor used as a subscript . for complex scaling factors , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "the associated scaled structures , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are given by@xmath10here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the same sets of numbers",
    ". however the value of a given element of @xmath11 is different than its value in @xmath12 because it belongs to a different complex number structure .",
    "numbers in the base set can be represented in the form @xmath13 .",
    "this represents the number in @xmath11 in @xmath9 that has value @xmath14 in @xmath5 @xmath15 and @xmath16 are examples of this .",
    "value maps of the components of representation structures onto the value structure , @xmath17 illustrate some properties of numbers and their values .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath13 be numbers in @xmath19 let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be value maps of @xmath8 and @xmath9 onto @xmath5 the two numbers , @xmath18 and @xmath13 , have the same value , @xmath14 .",
    "however they are different numbers .",
    "this can be seen from@xmath22 and@xmath23this equation holds of @xmath6 and @xmath24 are exchanged .    the relations between the base set numbers , @xmath25 and @xmath13 and their values in different structures are shown in figure [ nsqm1 ] .",
    "the figure shows clearly that @xmath18 and @xmath13 are different numbers even though they have the same value in their respective structures .",
    "the action of @xmath21 on the components of @xmath9 is given by @xmath26this definition holds for @xmath20 and @xmath8 with @xmath24 replaced everywhere by @xmath27    this definition shows that the value functions are all bijections . as",
    "such they have inverses . for each @xmath6 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 this definition is closer to that in @xcite",
    ".    so far valuations of the different number structures , such as @xmath9 and @xmath8 have been described .",
    "what is needed is a relative valuation of the components of one structure as a function of the components of another structure .",
    "this will be much used later on .",
    "this is achieved by a map of the components of @xmath9 onto those of @xmath8 such that eq .",
    "[ vsat ] is satisfied .",
    "let @xmath30 be such a map .",
    "the action of @xmath30 on the components of @xmath9 is given by @xmath31    this definition shows that @xmath30 defines a number structure , @xmath32 that represents the components of @xmath33 in terms of those of @xmath34 @xmath35 is given by@xmath36here @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the numbers in @xmath12 that have @xmath6 values , @xmath24 and @xmath39 in @xmath5    note that @xmath30 is the identity map on the base set .",
    "this follows from eq .",
    "[ vsat ] @xmath40 and the fact that @xmath20 is a bijection .",
    "these results show that @xmath41    the description of @xmath35 in eq .",
    "[ bcts ] seems strange because @xmath42 can have a complex value and satisfy the multiplicative identity axiom .",

    "also one has @xmath46 it follows from this and the bijective property of @xmath20 that @xmath47    some specific examples will help to make clearer some of the properties of the scaled complex number structures .",
    "the first example is for complex numbers that are also real rational numbers .",
    "values of these numbers will have the usual decimal form , such as @xmath48 let @xmath49 and @xmath50 the numbers , @xmath51 in @xmath52 and @xmath53 in @xmath54 have the same value , @xmath55 , in @xmath5 however , @xmath51 is a different number in @xmath56 than @xmath57    the same results hold for complex rational numbers . for example , let @xmath58 and @xmath59 and @xmath60 then @xmath18 and @xmath13 have the same respective @xmath6 and @xmath24 value , @xmath14 in @xmath5 but they are different numbers .",
    "these results extend to more general complex numbers . for example let @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 then @xmath18 and @xmath13 have the same @xmath6 and @xmath24 value , @xmath63 but they are different numbers in @xmath64    the above description of the effects of number scaling uses a representation of numbers as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the value of the number in @xmath9 .",
    "this representation is rather abstract as it makes no connection between numbers and other types of number representations that are more in tune with the usual usage .",
    "an example is the representation of numbers based on finite strings over an alphabet , @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "add two elements , @xmath67 and a point to the alphabet .",
    "these strings with lexicographic linear ordering , represent a big subset of the rational numbers in the fixed point representation .",

    "have the value @xmath72    the usual choice for the string to have the value @xmath4 is @xmath73 and equivalents .",
    "however any other choice is possible .",
    "the choice determines the scaling factor .",
    "for example , let the string @xmath74 have the value @xmath70 then the scaling factor , @xmath7 is the value of @xmath74 in the usual structure .",
    "this value is @xmath75    the strings can be used to define scaled complex number structures where the scaling factor is rational .",

    "its value depends on the structure containing it . for example , the string , @xmath73 has value @xmath4 in @xmath85 and value @xmath86 in @xmath9 .",
    "this scaling dependence extends to real numbers as infinite alphabet strings or equivalence classes of cauchy @xcite sequences of dedekind cuts of rational number strings , and to complex numbers as pairs of real numbers .",
    "if @xmath87 and @xmath88 are infinite alphabet strings or cauchy sequences of rational numbers and @xmath24 and @xmath6 are complex number values , then the value of @xmath89 in @xmath9 , relative to that in @xmath8 is given by @xmath90      as noted before , number scaling affects types of mathematical structures whose description includes maps to scalars , vector spaces with norms or scalar products and vector scalar multiplication are examples of such structures . because of these maps , vector space structures should not be considered in isolation . instead the associated scalar structure should be included .    as an example",

    "they are used to describe the effects of a scalar scaling field on some simple properties of quantum systems .",
    "the use of euclidean space as the base space of the bundles , and local mathematical systems at each base space point , enables the local description of nonlocal properties , such as those described by space integrals and derivatives ( as local limits of nonlocal properties ) , of quantum systems .",

    "this includes the collapsing of @xmath464 to one @xmath125 location such as @xmath486 for @xmath487 the reason is that mathematical structures , as models of axioms , have meaning or value .",
    "they are semantic structures .",
    "the important point is that the concept of meaning is observer related .",
    "it is based on the idea that meaningfulness or value is a local concept associated with individual observers .",
    "mathematics in a textbook , described in a lecture , or on a computer screen , has no meaning or value until the information is transmitted by a physical medium , such as light or sound , to the observers brain .",
    "the concept of meaning or value is localized to the observers location .",
    "if the observer moves through space then the localization of meaning or value follows a path in @xmath125 .",
    "since meaningfulness or value applies to many observers , there are many points in @xmath125 that are observer reference locations .",
    "as noted before , interest in local representations of physical and geometric quantities and the attendant scaling has its origin in gauge theories .",
    "the gauge freedom in these theories requires the use of separate vector spaces at each space time point .",
    "unitary transformations between spaces at different locations represent the freedom of basis choice in each space .",
    "since scalar fields , as real or complex numbers , are part of the description of vector spaces , it seems natural to consider them also as localized .",
    "the freedom of choice of bases in vector spaces is expanded to include freedom of choice of scaling factors in the fields .",
    "since numbers play such an essential role in physics it seems worthwhile to extend this localization and scaling factor choice to other mathematical structures used in other areas of physics .",
    "this includes those structures that include numbers as part of their description .",
    "examples include vector spaces , algebras , group representations as matrices , and many other systems .",
    "this is what is done here for complex numbers as used in quantum mechanics .    a very important open question concerns the physical existence , if any , of the scalar scaling field , @xmath160",
    ". candidates include the higgs boson @xcite , dark matter @xcite , dark energy @xcite , inflaton @xcite , quintessence @xcite , etc .",
    "as noted elsewhere @xcite , the lack of direct physical evidence for the @xmath160 field means that the coupling constant of @xmath160 to fermion fields must be very small compared to the fine structure constant .",
    "this is required by the great accuracy of quantum electrodynamics without any @xmath160 field components .",
    "some intriguing points are worth noting .",
    "if the @xmath160 field has single particle excited states , then the particles would be scalar bosons , presumably of spin @xmath72 the only particle field with this property is the higgs boson . is the @xmath160 field related to the higgs boson ?",
    "another point concerns the relation of dark energy to the physical vacuum energy as expanding space time .",
    "the effect of scaling on geometric quantities as in @xcite is in some ways similar . as was noted , the number @xmath1 is unique as the only number whose value is independent of scaling . in this sense",
    "it is like a number vacuum .",
    "assume that the scaling factor is time dependent .",
    "then the distance between points in @xmath125 , as a number value in @xmath488 is a function of @xmath133 and @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath489 is a distance of two points at time @xmath490 then the distance between the same points at time @xmath491 is @xmath492 @xcite .",
    "is this related to dark energy ?",
    "answers to these and other questions is work for the future .",
    "the lack of physical evidence for the effect of the @xmath160 field in quantum mechanics , as shown here , means that the variation of the @xmath160 field over the region of cosmological space and time in which experiments have been conducted is below experimental error .",
    "this is equivalent to the requirement that the vector field @xmath493 as the gradient of @xmath387 be so small as to have avoided detection in the region of experiments done to date .",
    "this is the region occupied by us as beings capable of carrying out experiments and making theory predictions .",
    "it is impossible to predict what the future will say about the @xmath160 field or its gradient .",
    "however it is the case that all experiments done by us , in the past , now , or in the future , will be done in a region of cosmological space and time that is either occupiable by us , or by other intelligent beings on distant planets with whom we can communicate effectively .",
    "one estimate @xcite of the size of this region is as a sphere of about @xmath494 light years in diameter that includes the solar system .",
    "the exact size of the region is not important .",
    "the only requirement is that it is small compared to the size of the universe .",
    "the result of these considerations is that there are no restrictions on the properties of the @xmath160 field in space and time regions outside of the occupiable one .",
    "nothing prevents the @xmath160 field from being very large with rapidly varying gradients in these regions .",
    "this applies to regions close to the big bang , about @xmath495 billion years ago , as well as to most of the universe .",
    "it is clear that there is much more work needed .",
    "this includes expansion of the manifold to space time to include special relativity and to a pseudo reimannian manifold for general relativity .",
    "one may hope that these expansions will offer some clues to the physical nature of the scalar scaling field .",
