    "[ sintro ]    let @xmath0 be a smooth oriented surface , possibly with boundary . in many cases  most importantly , for the study of the mapping class group @xmath2 and for the construction of a modular functor ",
    "it is convenient to represent @xmath0 as a result of gluing together several simple pieces , which should be surfaces with a boundary .",
    "it is easy to show that such a representation ( we will call it a _ parameterization _ ) is always possible if we allow these pieces to be spheres with @xmath3 holes , or , more generally , spheres with @xmath4 holes . for example , if we want to construct a modular functor , then it suffices to define the vector spaces for each of these `` simple pieces '' , and then , since the behavior of the modular functor under gluing is known , this defines uniquely the vector space which should be assigned to @xmath0 . from the point of view of the mapping class groups , every parameterization defines a homeomorphism of the product of the mapping class groups of the pieces into @xmath2 . in particular , in this way one can get a number of elements and relations in @xmath2 , and this can be used to get a full set of generators and relations of @xmath2 .",
    "this approach was first suggested by grothendieck ( see below ) , who called it `` the lego  teichmller game ''    in all of these applications , it is important to note that the same surface @xmath0 can have many different parameterizations .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask the following questions .",
    "how can one describe different ways of gluing `` standard pieces '' that give parameterizations of the same surface @xmath0 ?",
    "can we define some `` simple moves '' so that we can pass from a given parameterization to any other by a sequence of these simple moves ? and",
    ", finally , can one describe all the relations between these simple moves , i.e.  describe when a sequence of simple moves applied to a parameterization yields the same parameterization ?",
    "these questions were studied in a series of pioneering papers of moore and seiberg @xcite .",
    "these authors used spheres with 3 holes ( trinions ) as their building blocks , and they gave a complete set of simple moves and relations among them .",
    "however , their paper @xcite has some serious flaws .",
    "first of all , they use the language of chiral vertex operators , which is important for applications to conformal field theory , but which is not really relevant for finding the set of simple moves and relations , since this question is of purely topological nature .",
    "this lead them to miss some `` obvious '' axioms which are automatically satisfied in any conforaml field theory .",
    "what is worse , their proof contains some gaps , the most serious of them being a completely inadequate treatment of the case of surfaces of higher genus with @xmath5 holes .",
    "the reason is that they used an explicit presentation of the mapping class group @xmath2 by generators and relations , found by wajnryb @xcite , and such a presentation for surfaces of higher genus was known only for surfaces with @xmath6 holes .",
    "( for surfaces with arbitrary number of holes , a presentation of the mapping class groups by generators and relations was recently found in @xcite ; this presentation uses infinite number of generators  all dehn twists . )    in this paper , we give a reformulation and a rigorous proof of the result of moore and seiberg , i.e. , we construct a set of simple moves and relations among them , which turn the set of all parameterizations into a connected and simply - connected cw complex .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this has not been done accurately before ; the only works in this direction we are aware of are an unfinished and unpublished manuscript by kevin walker , and the book @xcite , in which it is proved that every modular tensor category gives rise to a modular functor .",
    "we mostly use spheres with @xmath4 holes as our building blocks , which allows us to simplify the arguments ; however , we also give version of the main theorem whihc only uses spheres with @xmath7 holes .",
    "we do not use explicit presentation of the mapping class groups @xmath8 for @xmath9 by generators and relations .",
    "instead , we refer to the results of hatcher and thurston @xcite and their refinement by harer @xcite , who solved a similar problem for the cut systems on @xmath0",
    ". our exposition is purely topological and requires no knowledge of modular functors .",
    "our motivation for this work came form the conformal field theory and modular functors .",
    "however , this work can also be useful for the study of _ teichmller tower _",
    ", introduced by a.  grothendieck in his famous _ esquisse dun programme _ @xcite .",
    "this tower consists of all stable algebraic curves of any genus @xmath10 with any number @xmath11 of marked points ( punctures ) linked with the operation of `` gluing '' .",
    "the fundamental groupoid @xmath12 of the corresponding moduli space is called the teichmller groupoid .",
    "the most fascinating thing is that the absolute galois group @xmath13 acts on the profinite completion @xmath14 of the tower of teichmller groupoids , and this action is faithful ",
    "it is faithful already on @xmath15 @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "grothendieck states in @xcite as a very plausible conjecture that the entire teichmller tower can be reconstructed from the first two levels ( i.e. , the cases when @xmath16 ) via the operation of `` gluing '' , level @xmath17 gives a complete system of generators , and level @xmath18 a complete system of relations :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  , en ce sens que via lopration fondamentale de `` recollement '' , ltage @xmath17 fournit un systme complet de gnrateurs , et ltage @xmath18 un systme complet de relations . _",
