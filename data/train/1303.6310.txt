    "nature has always been an inspiration for researchers . in the past",
    ", many new nature - inspired algorithms have been developed to solve hard problems in optimization . in general , there are two main concepts developed in bio - inspired computation :    1 .   evolutionary algorithms , 2 .",
    "swarm intelligence algorithms .",
    "the evolutionary algorithms are optimization techniques  @xcite that base on the darwin s principle of survival of the fittest  @xcite .",
    "it states that in nature the fittest indivi- + duals have greater chances to survive .",
    "the evolutionary algorithms consist of the following disciplines : genetic algorithms , evolution strategies , genetic programming , evolutionary programming , differential evolution .",
    "although all these algorithms or methods have been developed independently , they share similar characteristics ( like variation operators , selection operators ) when solving problems .",
    "in fact , the evolutionary algorithms are distinguished by their representation of solutions .",
    "for example , the genetic algorithms  @xcite support the binary representation of solutions , evolution strategies  @xcite and differential evolution  @xcite work on real - valued solutions , genetic programming  @xcite acts on programs in lisp , while the evolutionary programming  @xcite behaves with the finish state automata .",
    "the evolutionary algorithms have been applied to a wide range of areas of optimization , modeling and simulation . essentially ,",
    "the differential evolution has successfully + been employed in the following areas of optimization : function optimization  @xcite , large - scale global optimization  @xcite , graph coloring  @xcite , chemical - process optimization  @xcite .",
    "swarm intelligence is a collective behaviour of decentralized , self - organized systems , either natural or artificial .",
    "swarm intelligence was introduced by beni in 1989 .",
    "a lot of algorithms have been proposed since then .",
    "the swarm - intelligence algorithms have been applied on continuous as well as combinatorial optimization problems  @xcite .",
    "the most well - known classes of the swarm - intelligence algorithms are : particle swarm optimization , ant colony optimization , artificial bee colony , firefly algorithm , cuckoo search and bat algorithm .",
    "particle swarm optimization has been successfully applied in problems of the antenna design  @xcite and electromagnetics  @xcite .",
    "the ant colony algorithms have also been used in many areas of optimization  @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the artificial bee colony shows good performance in numerical optimization  @xcite @xcite , in large - scale global optimization  @xcite and also in combinatorial optimization  @xcite @xcite @xcite .    the cuckoo search algorithm is a very strong method for function optimization and also for engineering optimization problems @xcite @xcite .",
    "the firefly algorithm shows promising results in function optimization and provides good results also in combinatorial optimization  @xcite .",
    "echolocation is an important feature of bat behaviour .",
    "that means that bats emit a sound pulse and listen to the echo bouncing back from obstacles whilst flying .",
    "this phenomenon has inspired yang  @xcite to develop the bat algorithm ( ba ) .",
    "the algorithm shows good results when dealing with lower - dimensional optimization problems , but may become problematic for higher - dimensional problems because of its tending to converge very fast initially . on the other hand ,",
    "the differential evolution  @xcite is a typical evolutionary algorithm with differential mutation , crossover and selection that is being successfully applied to continuous function optimization .    to improve the bat - algorithm behaviour for higher - dimensional problems , we hybridized the original bat algorithm by using differential - evolution strategies .",
    "this hybridized bat algorithm ( hba ) was tested on a standard set of benchmark functions taken from literature .",
    "results of our numerical experiments show that the proposed hba can significantly improve the performance of the original ba , which can be very useful for the future .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , we introduced the original ba and the differential evolution algorithm and explain some biological foundations of the bat behaviour . in section 3",
    "we describe our novel approach to hybridizing the bat algorithm with differential evolution strategies . in section 4",
    "we illustrate our experiments and discuss the obtained results .",
    "the paper ends by presenting our plans for future work on hba development .",
    "the bat algorithm was developed by xin - she yang in 2010  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm exploits the so - called echolocation of the bats .",
    "the bats use sonar echoes to detect and avoid obstacles .",
    "it is generally known that sound pulses are transformed into a frequency which reflects from obstacles .",
    "the bats navigate by using the time delay from emission to reflection .",
    "they typically emit short , loud sound impulses .",
    "the pulse rate is usually defined as 10 to 20 times per second . after hitting and reflecting ,",
    "the bats transform their own pulse into useful information to gauge how far away the prey is . the bats are using wavelengths that vary in the range from 0.7 to 17 mm or inbound frequencies of 20 - 500 khz . to implement the algorithm , the pulse frequency and the rate have to be defined .",
    "the pulse rate can be simply determined in the range from 0 to 1 , where 0 means that there is no emission and 1 means that the bats emitting is their maximum  @xcite .",
    "the bat behaviour can be used to formulate a new ba .",
    "yang  @xcite used three generalized rules when implementing the bat algorithms :    1 .",
    "all the bats use an echolocation to sense the distance and they also guess the difference between the food / prey and background barriers in a somewhat magical way .",
    "when searching for their prey , the bats fly randomly with velocity @xmath0 at position @xmath1 with fixed frequency @xmath2 , varying wavelength @xmath3 and loudness @xmath4 .",
    "they can automatically adjust the wavelength ( or frequency ) of their emitted pulses and adjust the rate of pulse emission @xmath5 $ ] , depending on the proximity of their target .",
    "although the loudness can vary in many ways , we assume that it varies from a large ( positive ) @xmath4 to a minimum constant value @xmath6 .",
    "objective function @xmath7 , @xmath8 initialize the bat population @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 define pulse frequency @xmath12 $ ] initialize pulse rates @xmath13 and the loudness @xmath14 while ( @xmath15 ) // number of iterations  generate new solutions by adjusting frequency and  update velocities and locations / solutions [ eq.(2 ) to ( 4 ) ]  if(@xmath16 )  select a solution among the best solutions  generate a local solution around the best solution  end if  generate a new solution by flying randomly  if(@xmath17 )  accept the new solutions  increase @xmath13 and reduce @xmath14  end if  rank the bats and find the current best end postprocess results and visualization    the original ba is illustrated in algorithm  [ bat ] . in this algorithm ,",
    "the bat behaviour is captured into the fitness function of the problem to be solved .",
    "it consists of the following components :    * initialization ( lines 2 - 4 ) , * generation of new solutions ( lines 6 - 7 ) , * local search ( lines 8 - 11 ) , * generation of a new solution by flying randomly ( lines 12 - 16 ) and * find the current best solution .",
    "initialization of the bat population is performed randomly .",
    "generating new solutions is performed by moving virtual bats according to the following equations : @xmath18    where @xmath19 is a uniform distribution .",
    "a random walk with direct exploitation is used for the local search that modifies the current best solution according to equation : @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the scaling factor , and @xmath22 the loudness .",
    "the local search is launched with the proximity depending on pulse rate @xmath13 .",
    "the term in line 13 is similar to the simulated annealing behavior , where the new solution is accepted with some proximity depending on parameter @xmath14 . in line with this",
    ", the rate of pulse emission @xmath13 increases and the loudness @xmath14 decreases .",
    "both characteristics imitate the natural bats , where the rate of the pulse emission increases and the loudness decreases when a bat finds its prey .",
    "mathematically , these characteristics are captured with the following equations : @xmath23,\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants . actually , @xmath24 + parameter plays a similar role as the cooling factor in the simulated annealing algorithm that controls the convergence rate of this algorithm .",
    "differential evolution ( de)@xcite@xcite is a technique for the optimization introduced by storn and price in 1995 . de optimizes a problem by maintaining a population of candidate solutions and creates new candidate solutions by combining the existing ones according to its simple formulae , and then keeping whichever candidate solution has the best score or fitness on the optimization problem at hand .",
    "de supports a differential mutation , a differential crossover and a differential selection .",
    "in particular , the differential mutation randomly selects two solutions and adds a scaled difference between these to the third solution .",
    "this mutation can be expressed as follows :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 $ ] denotes the scaling factor as a positive real number that scales the rate of modification while @xmath28 are randomly selected vectors in the interval @xmath29 .",
    "a uniform crossover is employed as a differential crossover by de .",
    "the trial vector is built out of parameter values copied from two different solutions .",
    "mathematically , this crossover can be expressed as follows :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 $ ] controls the fraction of parameters that are copied to the trial solution .",
    "note , the relation @xmath32 assures that the trial vector is different from the original solution @xmath33 .",
    "mathematically , differential selection can be expressed as follows :    @xmath34    in the technical sense , the crossover and mutation can be performed in many ways in de . therefore , a specific notation was used to describe the variety of these methods ( also strategies ) in general .",
    "for example , `` de / rand/1/bin '' denotes that the base vector is randomly selected , one vector difference is added to it , and the number of modified parameters in the mutation vector follows the binomial distribution .",
    "as mentioned above , in this article we propose a new ba , called hybrid bat algorithm ( hba ) .",
    "it was obtained by hybridizing the original ba using the de strategies .",
    "the hba pseudo - code is illustrated in algorithm  [ hbat ] .",
    "objective function @xmath7 , @xmath8 initialize the bat population @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 define pulse frequency @xmath12 $ ] initialize pulse rates @xmath13 and the loudness @xmath14 while ( @xmath15 ) // number of iterations  generate new solutions by adjusting frequency and  updating velocities and locations / solutions [ eq.(2 ) to ( 4 ) ]  if(@xmath16 )  * modify the solution using `` de / rand/1/bin '' *  end if  generate a new solution by flying randomly  if(@xmath17 )  accept the new solutions  increase @xmath13 and reduce @xmath14  end if  rank the bats and find the current best end postprocess results and visualization    as a result , hba differs from the original ba in line 9 , where solution is modified using `` de / rand/1/bin '' strategy .",
    "the goal of our experiments was to show that hba significantly improves the results of the original ba . for this purpose ,",
    "two bas were implemented according to specifications given in algorithms  [ bat ] and [ hbat ] so that a well - selected set of test functions in the literature are used for optimization benchmarks .",
    "the parameters of the two bas were the same .",
    "the dimension of the problem significantly affects the results + optimization . to test the impact of the problem dimension on the results , three different sets of dimensions were taken into account , i.e. , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . the functions with dimension @xmath35",
    "were limited to maximally 1,000 generations , the functions with dimension @xmath36 to twice as much , while the functions with dimension @xmath37 to 3,000 .",
    "the initial loudness was set to @xmath38 and so was also the initial pulse rate ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the frequency was taken from interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the algorithms optimized each function 25 times and results were measured according to the best , worst , mean , and medium values in these runs .",
    "the standard deviation of the mean values was calculated as well .",
    "our test suite consists of five standard functions taken from literature  @xcite .",
    "the functions in this test suite are represented below .",
    "the aim of the function is overcoming failures to optimize each variable independently .",
    "this function is multimodal , since the number of local optima increases with the dimensionality .",
    "after dimensionalities are sufficiently high ( @xmath41 ) , multimodality seems to disappear and the problem turns to be unimodal .",
    "@xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the global minimum of the function is at 0 .",
    "as in case of the rastrigin s function , the rosenbrock s function too , has its value 0 at the global minimum .",
