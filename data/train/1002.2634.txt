    "the origin of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) prompt emission remains unclear .",

    "many models have been proposed to explain these properties .",
    "most of them invoke a relativistic jet that is energized by a newly born compact object .",
    "currently three types of emission mechanisms in the relativistic jet are being actively discussed ; photospheric , leptonic synchrotron , and hadronic emission models .",

    "clarifying the prompt emission mechanism and the physical quantities at the emission site would help understand the nature of the relativistic jet and the compact object that energizes the jet .",
    "for other models and more general discussions , see recent reviews @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    grbs were only sparsely observed in the @xmath3mev energy range , until the _ fermi _ satellite was launched 2008 june 11 .",
    "now the gbm ( @xmath4 ) and the lat ( @xmath5 ) detectors onboard _ fermi _ provide extremely broad energy coverage with good temporal resolution for grbs .",
    "the _ fermi _ observations will put further constraints on the above three types of prompt emission models . during its first @xmath6yr routine operation , the lat has detected 14 grbs . those are summarized in @xcite .",
    "most of their spectra are fitted by a band function even up to @xmath7gev , while at least 3 grbs ( grb 090510 , grb 090902b , and grb 090926a ) have additional distinct spectral component at @xmath1mev .",
    "those additional components are fitted by single power - law function .",
    "these 3 grbs are among the brightest grbs detected by _",
    "fermi_. this suggests that such a high - energy component may be very common and we can clearly detect such a distinct high - energy component only in bright lat grbs @xcite .",
    "_ fermi _ also revealed that the high - energy emission ( @xmath8mev ) of most lat grbs is delayed behind the onset of the mev emission , and the high - energy emission of many lat grbs lasts longer than the mev emission , showing power - law decays , which are typically detected until @xmath9s .",
    "the delay times in the cosmological rest frame are @xmath10s for long grbs and @xmath11s for short bursts grb 081024b and grb 090510 . although some delays of the high - energy photons are just caused by the flux increases above the lat detection threshold without a spectral change , others must clearly be attributed to the spectral changes of the band component and/or the onset of the distinct spectral component .",
    "we note that the distinct components of the 3 grbs are delayed .",
    "the origins of the distinct spectral components and the onset delays in the high - energy range have been actively debated .",
    "it has been proposed that the high - energy emission can be attributed to the external shock , which is made by the interaction of the jet with the ambient medium , and the onset delays can correspond to the times for the jet decelerations @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the observed high - energy emission usually has a strong variability and it often correlates with the mev emission , which is at odds with an external shock origin . especially for grb 090510",
    ", whose long - lived high - energy emission can be explained by the external shock synchrotron emission together with the optical and x - ray afterglows detected from @xmath12s after the burst trigger @xcite , it is found that the high - energy emission in the prompt phase is much brighter than that produced by the same external shock @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion has been obtained for grb 090902b @xcite . as for the internal shock models ,",
    "it is not simple to explain the lat onset delays which are larger than the variability timescales ( @xmath13 ) by the delayed brightening of the ssc emission @xcite .",
    "the spectral index of the distinct high - energy component different from the band low - energy spectral index , seen in e.g. , grb 090902b , may not be explained simply either in these models . to overcome these problems ,",
    "we have proposed an external inverse compton ( eic ) component ( i.e. , the emission produced by up - scattering the photons incident from outside the shock ) in addition to the synchrotron and ssc components in the internal shock model @xcite ; this model , however , requires an extreme value of the microphysical parameter @xmath14 , which does not seem common .",

    "in this paper we concentrate on a photospheric emission model .",
    "such models have been briefly discussed for interpreting the relation of the mev emission with the high - energy emission . in this scenario ,",
    "the photosphere produces a band emission component which peaks around @xmath10mev , and this can not generally produce the high - energy emission because of large opacity for @xmath15 pair creation .",
    "the high - energy emission in these models may instead arise in a dissipation region at a larger radius @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we substantially extend this idea and discuss its consequences in greater depth .",
    "we focus on the case in which the energy of the jet is mainly carried by photons and baryons ( where magnetic field energy is subdominant ) , and the dissipation mechanism at large radius is internal shock . we show that in typical cases the photospheric emission is efficiently compton scattered by the electrons in internal shocks outside the photosphere , and find that the up - scattered photospheric ( up ) emission is a good candidate for the observed high - energy emission in the prompt phase .",
    "this compton scattering is a type of the eic scattering , which is thought to be important for the high - energy emission of blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and could also be important in the internal and external shocks in grbs @xcite .",
    "we make a generic formulation of the spectral types of the radiation from the photosphere and the internal shock including synchrotron and ssc emission for the cases of the efficient eic scattering , and clarify necessary conditions for the photospheric and up components to be dominant in the energy range of @xmath16 , rather than synchrotron and ssc components .",
    "this formulation is applied for the well - observed lat long and short grbs , grb 080916c , grb 090902b , and grb 090510 , and we typically find reasonable parameter sets for which the data can be explained by the photospheric and up emission .",
    "our model fits indicate that the observed delayed onset of the lat emission may be interpreted as the parameter evolution of the grb jet .",
    "the up emission ceases at the end of the prompt mev ( photospheric ) emission , and the subsequent long - lived high - energy emission may instead be related to the external shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a different origin for the prompt and late lat emission is in fact implied by the change in its behavior across this transition @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we concentrate on the prompt emission phase .",
    "we discuss the general temporal and spectral properties of the radiation from the photosphere and the internal shock of the grb jet in sections [ sec : ph ] , [ sec : temporal ] , and [ sec : spectral ] , and perform the case studies of grb 080916c , grb 090902b , and grb 090510 in section [ sec : case ] .",
    "some of the implications of our results are discussed in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider that the jet is accelerated by the thermal pressure , and the magnetic field energy is subdominant .",
    "we derive the luminosity and temperature of the photospheric emission from the jet and the remaining kinetic luminosity of the jet above the photosphere , which is the luminosity budget for internal shocks , according to the standard fireball model @xcite .",
    "we assume that the jet material is optically thick and the energy is dominated by thermal radiation at the base , @xmath17 , from where it expands in the roughly adiabatic condition , i.e. , without strong conversion of the kinetic energy into the thermal energy affecting the adiabatic expansion dynamics ( for a continuous strong dissipation case , see * ? ? ?",
    "the jet material may have a lorentz factor @xmath18 at the base .",
    "in particular , if the grb originates from a massive stellar collapse and the jet suffers strong dissipation of its kinetic energy due to interaction with the stellar envelope , the front portion of the jet may have @xmath19 cm and @xmath20 ( see recent numerical simulations by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and discussion in section  [ sec : summary ] ) . in the absence of a strong dissipation",
    "the base radius may be as small as a few of schwarzschild radius of the central compact object , so that @xmath21 cm and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the mass of the central object .",
    "the observer - frame temperature at the base is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the isotropic equivalent luminosity of the jet , and @xmath26 is the stefan constant . in cgs units throughout this paper . ] for general cases of grbs , the adiabatic index of the jet material below the photosphere is found to be 4/3 ( see below ) .",
    "the dynamics of the expanding jet can be summarized as @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 , where the lorentz factor saturation radius @xmath33 .",
    "here we have defined @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the isotropic equivalent mass ejection rate .",
    "we see that the ratio of the radiation and baryon entropy densities @xmath36 is constant throughout the evolution below the photosphere and is much larger than unity if @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the baryon density and fluid temperature in the comoving frame ) .",
    "thus the assumption of the adiabatic index @xmath40 is validated .",
    "the @xmath15 pairs drop out of equilibrium at @xmath41kev , at a radius @xmath42 cm .",
    "we consider the case in which the jet carries enough baryons to provide an electron scattering photosphere above @xmath43 ( i.e. , the case of @xmath44 ) .",
    "then the photosphere radius @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the thomson cross section and the comoving electron density is given by @xmath48 , if there is no additional @xmath15 pair creation in the jet @xcite .",
    "if no energy dissipation takes place around the photosphere , the photons and particles are fully thermalized , typically with the comoving temperature @xmath49kev , and then the emerging radiation from the photosphere is a blackbody with the observer - frame temperature @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 is the lorentz factor at @xmath52 ) . however , some energy dissipation processes are expected to occur around the photosphere , which can make the emerging radiation spectrum deviate from a blackbody .",
    "such processes have been demonstrated convincingly by recent analytical and numerical work : both below and above the photosphere , a fraction of the electrons can acquire high - temperature distribution ( @xmath53 ) , either due to internal shocks and/or interaction of a jet with stellar envelope @xcite , dissipation of excited plasma waves @xcite , or nuclear collisions between protons and neutrons @xcite , or in magnetically - dominated jets due to scattering with turbulent alfvn waves @xcite or heating caused by magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "multiple ic scatterings of the thermal photons by mildly relativistic electrons ( with @xmath54 ) can create a power - law tail extending from the thermal peak , which saturates at the comoving - frame energy @xmath55 as the klein - nishina limit or by the direct compton cooling , which is boosted to @xmath56gev in the observer frame .",
    "the dissipation processes also can produce a relativistic electron population , which ic - scatter the photons to even higher energies , the limitation being the @xmath57 absorption against lower energy photons . the low - energy spectral slope of the emerging photons should not be significantly changed in such processes , i.e. , the photon index @xmath58 @xcite .    in our baryonic jet model , we assume that the dissipation of the kinetic energy is not so strong that the jet dynamics is described by the adiabatic evolution , and the temperature of the emerging photons is given by @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that the energy flux in the possible non - thermal part above @xmath60 should be smaller than that in the main thermal part , leading to an upper limit on the photon index @xmath61 of the possible power - law tail .",

    "dissipation processes copious @xmath75 pairs may be created , which increase the thomson photosphere radius .",

    "we have shown that if the grb jet is in the efficient scattering regime right from the start , the simple kinematic effect causes the onset of the first up emission to be delayed with respect to that of the first photospheric emission by a timescale comparable to the pulse widths or pulse separations of the photospheric emission , which should be smaller than the variability timescale apparent in the mev light curve ( see section  [ sec : temporal ] ) .",
    "this may not explain the time delays much larger than the apparent variability timescale observed in most of the lat grbs . in our model , such observed large time delays may instead be attributed to a temporal evolution of the jet parameters , @xmath25 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath13 , a possible origin for which is discussed in the next paragraph . from the model fits of the time - binned spectra of the three lat grbs ( in section  [ sec : case ] ) , we found that the parameter regime should shift from @xmath81 into @xmath84 to reproduce the observed spectra ( this shift leads to the increase of @xmath393 ; equation  [ eq : x_high ] and [ eq : x_low ] ) . in this case",
    "the up emission component starts with a small delay with respect to the photospheric emission onset by the timescale comparable to the photospheric variability time , being still dim compared with the photospheric emission while @xmath81 , but starts to be bright and detected by lat when the parameters shift into the regime of @xmath84 .",

    "the progenitors of long grbs are thought to be collapsing massive stars , and such a decrease of @xmath136 may be explained by the interaction of the jet with the stellar envelope before the jet breakout .",
    "the numerical simulations by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the jet has three parts around the time when it breaks out the star ; the jet head , the collimation - shocked part , and the free expansion part .",
    "the jet head is defined as the very thin part at the front end of the jet between the forward and reverse shocks , which typically has a mildly relativistic speed and the material inside this part escapes sideways into the cocoon ; a large fraction of the jet behind the jet head , suffering weaker dissipation by collimation shocks , has a relativistic speed ; and behind the collimation - shocked part , the jet material suffers much weaker dissipation , expanding adiabatically . while the free expansion part which follows has a saturated lorentz factor of @xmath397 . ] for the collimation - shocked part , @xmath335 may be the stellar radius and @xmath398 is given by its lorentz factor at the breakout time , while for the free expansion part , @xmath335 may be the size of the central compact object and @xmath22 .",
    "in such a jet structure , the emission properties may be changed at the transition between the collimation - shocked part and the free expansion part .",

    "the value @xmath404 cm for the free expansion part is what might be expected from a compact object size @xmath405 cm and @xmath22 .",
    "this @xmath335 is a few schwarzschild radii of an object of mass @xmath406 . as for the short grb 090510",

    "this might suggest a smaller size of the progenitor and the central object than those of long grbs .",
    "in such a scenario , the delay timescale of the lat emission @xmath410 is related to the global properties of the jets and the progenitor systems , rather than the microphysical processes or the simple kinematic ( propagation ) effects , and then it might scale with the total duration of the mev emission @xmath411 .",

    "as seen in the three bursts we have studied in detail , the parameter regime is assumed to stay @xmath84 in a large fraction of the total duration in our model .",

    "<S> radially inhomogeneous gamma - ray burst ( grb ) jets release variable photospheric emission and can have internal shocks occurring above the photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we generically formulate a photospheric emission model of grbs including compton up - scattered photospheric ( up ) emission off the electrons ( and positrons ) in the internal shocks , and find that the photospheric emission may correspond to the traditional ( band ) component at @xmath0mev and the up emission to the high - energy emission observed by _ </S>",
    "<S> fermi_/lat for some grbs at @xmath1mev . </S>",
    "<S> the two components can be separate in the spectrum in some cases or can mimic a smooth broad band spectrum in other cases . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our formulation to the well - studied long and short lat grbs , grb 080916c , grb 090902b , and grb 090510 , and typically find reasonable parameters for fitting the time - binned spectra , although fine tuning of several parameters is required . </S>",
    "<S> the observed delays of the high - energy emission with respect to the mev emission which are large compared to the variability times are unlikely to be due to simple kinematic effects of a non - evolving jet . </S>",
    "<S> these delays may instead be attributed to the temporal evolution of the physical parameters of the jet , and thus the delay timescales could provide a potential tool for investigating the structures of grb jets themselves and their progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of the delay timescales of long and short grbs inferred from the _ fermi _ data might be due to the differences in the progenitors of long and short grbs . </S>",
    "<S> some other properties and consequences of this model are discussed , including temporal correlations among the prompt optical , the soft x - ray , and the distinct high - energy component as well as the band component .    </S>",
