    "m - theory on @xmath1 suggested by horava and witten  @xcite seems to be a better candidate than the weakly coupled string to explain the low energy physics and unification of all the fundamental interactions  @xcite .",
    "many recent studies in m - theory compactification and its phenomenology implications  @xcite suggest that this may be the right track for super unification .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the soft terms in m - theory derived models . in supergravity grand",
    "unified theory ( gut ) models , there are several soft terms to determine the low energy physics : universal gaugino mass @xmath2 , universal scalar mass @xmath3 , trilinear coupling a - term , bilinear coupling b - term(s ) . compared to the spectrum of low energy super particles , the input parameters are really very few . however , a futher reduction of parameters may be realized in string theory . in the weakly coupled string ,",
    "there are two simplifying choices : ( 1 ) no - scale scenario  @xcite with @xmath4 ; ( 2 ) dilaton scenario  @xcite with @xmath5 . in our present discussion",
    ", we consider dilaton and moduli dominant susy breaking scenarios in m - theory . in addition , with the non - perturbative superpotential from the gaugino condensation  @xcite , we obtain the soft terms : @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 in terms of the hidden sector gauge coupling ( at the scale of @xmath8 ) in units of the gravitino mass .",
    "we find no consistent solution for moduli dominant susy breaking and only one choice of dilaton dominant supersymmetry breaking , the latter gives @xmath9 which differs from previously obtained results  @xcite .",
    "there might exist further moduli or other dilaton dominant susy breaking models , for there might exist other trigger of the susy breaking and we do not have a realistic model yet .",
    "furthermore , we suggest a massless scalar susy breaking scenario . because the gauge coupling in the hidden sector can not be too small , this scenario does not have flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) problem because derivations from zero mass for the scalar masses in different families are much smaller than the gaugino mass  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the soft terms are : @xmath10 where i=1 , 2 , 3 for three families .",
    "the lagrangian for the yang - mills field in m - theory is  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the 11-dimensional gravitational coupling and i=1,2 for the observable sector , hidden sector . in the simplest model",
    ", the gut scale coupling is related to moduli fields s and t by  @xcite : @xmath13 the definition of @xmath14 is  @xcite : @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the fifth ( or eleventh ) dimension radius , v is the internal calabi - yau volume and @xmath17 is the khler form .",
    "similarly , the gauge coupling in the hidden sector at the gut scale is @xmath18 inverting the relations in eq.s ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) , we obtain : @xmath19 and @xmath20 the khler potential @xmath21 , the gauge kinetic function @xmath22 and the superpotential @xmath23 in the simplest compactification of m - theory are  @xcite : @xmath24 @xmath25 - 3\\ln\\,[t+\\bar t ] ~,~\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the matter fields .",
    "we do not specify the exact trigger of the susy breaking , but just assume susy breaking by the f terms of the dilaton and moduli .",
    "then , we obtain the gaugino mass @xmath2 , scalar mass @xmath6 and the trilinear parameters a by standard soft term formulae  @xcite .",
    "we introduce the following parametrizations of @xmath31 and @xmath32 : @xmath33 @xmath34 where c is given in terms of the tree - level vacuum energy density @xmath35 given by @xmath36 . after normalizing the observable fields ,",
    "the soft terms are given by  @xcite : depends on the specific mechanism which could generate the associated @xmath37 term  @xcite , we do not discuss it here .",
    "in fact , if we had such term , we can discuss it by the same way in this paper .",
    "it is  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "if one consider @xmath41 , then one obtain : @xmath42 ] @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 here , the quantity x is defined as @xmath46 because @xmath47 and the gauge coupling in the hidden sector can not be infinity or negative , we have @xmath48    taking the cosmology constant is zero , i. e. , @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 . we choose @xmath51 for the following discussion .",
    "generically , the dynamics of the hidden sector may give rise to both @xmath52 and @xmath53 , but one type of f term often dominates .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the two limiting cases : dilaton dominant susy breaking ( @xmath54 ) and the moduli dominant susy breaking ( @xmath55 )  @xcite :    \\(i ) dilaton dominant susy breaking scenario ( @xmath54 ) . in this case ,",
    "the soft terms relations become , then one obtain : @xmath56 ] @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 the values of @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 versus @xmath60 are plotted in fig . 1 in units of gravitino mass .",
    "when @xmath61 , we obtain the predicted relation in the weakly coupled string  @xcite . when the gauge coupling in the hidden sector increases , @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 decrease . from the requirement @xmath62 , we obtain that @xmath63 is smaller than @xmath64 or 0.67423 . in the limit of @xmath65 , we find that @xmath66 , and the @xmath60 is about 0.2056 .",
    "\\(ii ) moduli dominant susy breaking scenario ( @xmath67 ) . in this case , the soft terms relations become , then one obtain : @xmath68 ] @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 therefore , we have @xmath72 from fig .",
    "2 , we see that if the coupling in the hidden sector is strong enough ( i. e. , @xmath73 ) , @xmath74 is about 2 .",
    "in addition , @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 increase wth the gauge coupling in the hidden sector .",
    "the nonperturbative superpotential in the simplest model was calculated recently , and its form is  @xcite : @xmath75 where the gauge group in the hidden sector is q ( we do not consider massless q matter fields except gluons and gluinos ) . in the simplest model q is @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 is the quadratic casimir of q and for @xmath76 , @xmath78 .",
    "next , we can calculate @xmath31 and @xmath32 from @xmath79 .",
    "noticing that @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 @xmath82 taking the ratio @xmath83 , we obtain the value of @xmath84 in terms of @xmath85 @xmath86    we now discuss the soft terms of compactification of m - theory on @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "although this is a toy model , it has three families , so it may shed light on the realistic model .",
    "the khler potential is : @xmath87 where i=1 , 2 , 3 is the family index , @xmath88 -\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\ln\\ , [ t_i + \\bar t_i ] ~,~ \\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath89 the gauge kinetic function in this model is @xmath90 @xmath91 and the superpotential is @xmath92 we parametrize @xmath31 and @xmath32 as follows : @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 then the normalized soft gaugino masses @xmath2 , the un - normalized soft scalar masses @xmath97 , and the trilinear parameters @xmath98 are given by  @xcite : @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 the non - zero @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to discuss the number of variables in this model , we introduce : @xmath105 where i=1 , 2 , 3 , with the condition that @xmath106 thus only two of the @xmath107 are independent variables when we consider @xmath60 as a fundamental variable .",
    "the angles @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 can be calculated in a way similar to the simplest model .",
    "we can express the 5 soft terms ( @xmath2 , @xmath111 ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 ) , a ) in terms of four variables ( @xmath60 , @xmath112 and two of the @xmath107 ( for example : @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) ) .",
    "the problem with this general model is that the universality of scalar masses may be violated and there are too many variables to make predictions . to obtain universal scalar masses",
    ", we assume that : @xmath115 from the result @xmath116 the ratios @xmath117 and @xmath118 lead to @xmath119 therefore , we can write the @xmath120 as @xmath121 after some calculations , we are able to show that the scalar masses are universal and that the soft terms are given by eqs.(19 ) , ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) and @xmath108 is given by eq .",
    "( 36 ) .    because @xmath63 is a function of @xmath60 , @xmath122 and @xmath7 are given by @xmath60 in units of the gravitino mass .",
    "in addition , it is obvious that moduli dominant susy breaking scenario does not exist for the numerator in @xmath84 is larger than zero . in the simplest model and the @xmath0 model , the gauge group in the hidden sector is @xmath76 , for which @xmath123 .",
    "the result is shown in the fig .",
    "3 . in order that the scalar mass square non negative , @xmath60 can not be larger than about 0.18 .",
    "there is only one choice of exact dilaton dominant susy breaking , which is : @xmath124 @xmath125 in order to avoid fcnc problems that might arise from the violation of the universal scalar masses in three families ( although this kind of the violation might be very small ) , it is reasonable assume that : @xmath126 if the gaugino mass is very large compared to the scalar masses , i. e. , @xmath127 , the universal radiative contribution to the scalar masses from the gaugino mass by rge running may wash out the non - universal scalar masses and avoid fcnc  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the gauge coupling in the hidden sector can not be too small as to go to the weakly coupled case and can not be too large , because the gaugino condesation scale is  @xcite @xmath128 and the gravitino mass is about @xmath129 in oder to have the gravitino mass at tev or hundred gev range , we can not have large @xmath60 or too small @xmath60 for a realistic model where @xmath77 might be about 12 as @xmath130 is @xmath131 , and when one consider the massless q matter fields in hidden sector , the total factor may be smaller .",
    "we propose the scalar massless scenario ( strictly speaking , very small scalar masses scenario ) as the most realistic . in this case , the soft terms and @xmath60 are given by : @xmath132 @xmath133    in a realistic model , the gauge group in the hidden sector might not be @xmath76 , if consider @xmath131 as the gauge group in the hidden sector , the quadratic casimir of @xmath131 is 12 . in this case",
    "that @xmath60 can not be larger than 0.151 , and the scalar massless scenario is : @xmath134 @xmath135 in comparison , the dilaton dominant susy breaking in this case is : @xmath136 @xmath137    from above discussion , in the dilaton dominant susy breaking scenario , the approximate soft term relations are @xmath138 in the massless scalar scenario , the soft term relations are @xmath139 it will be interesting to explore the phenomenology consequences of these relationships which are under investigations .",
