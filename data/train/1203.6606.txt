    "when using the search engine google , the rankings in search results take account of various aspects of web pages , but it has been acknowledged that the so - called pagerank algorithm provides crucial information for this purpose .",
    "this algorithm assigns to each web page a measure of its importance or popularity based solely on the link structure of the web .",
    "in particular , pages possessing more links , especially those from important pages , are given higher pagerank values , increasing the chance to be placed on the top of search results ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main challenges in implementing this algorithm is the size of the web .",
    "it is reported that the number of web page indices collected at google is over 10 billion , causing serious issues for computation .",
    "numerical methods for pagerank have been a subject of recent research . in the adaptive scheme of @xcite",
    ", computational resources are allocated to pages whose convergence to the pagerank values is slow . in @xcite ,",
    "the problem size is reduced by treating the set of the so - called dangling nodes as a single node .",
    "the work of @xcite employs techniques based on monte carlo simulation . on the other hand , numerical analysis methods known as asynchronous iterations",
    "@xcite are applied to pagerank algorithms in @xcite . in @xcite , a randomized algorithm",
    "is proposed based on stochastic descent methods with an explicit bound on the convergence rate .",
    "moreover , the variations in pagerank values when the link structure changes have been studied from the viewpoint of fragile / uncertain links in @xcite and also from optimization and linear algebra viewpoints in @xcite .    in our recent paper @xcite",
    ", we focused on this algorithm and developed a distributed randomized approach for pagerank computation . from the control theoretic viewpoint , a key observation is that the pagerank computation shares several features with the multi - agent consensus problems , which have gained much attention in recent years ; see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "thus , we view the web as a network of agents having computation and communication capabilities .",
    "the idea is to let each web page , or the server that hosts it , compute its own pagerank value by communicating with neighboring pages connected by direct links . to realize asynchronous communication",
    ", it employs the so - called gossip protocol , where the pages randomly determine when information should be transmitted .",
    "such a randomization - based method is motivated by the recent advances on probabilistic methods in systems and control @xcite and has been adopted in the literature of multi - agent consensus ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in @xcite , we have also considered the effects of communication failures among the pages under this approach .",
    "this paper aims at generalizing the distributed pagerank algorithms in @xcite so that they can be used in an environment under limited resources .",
    "in particular , we develop efficient algorithms by reducing the amount of computation and communication loads .",
    "in such an environment , the computation of the true pagerank values may be difficult .",
    "consequently , we provide an alternative method for finding a good approximate with bounds on the possible errors .    the proposed approach is based on a novel aggregation method of the original web to reduce the size of the problem .",
    "the pages are first divided into a number of groups , for example , based on the hosts or the domains of the pages",
    ". it is known that most of the links in the web are intra - host ones @xcite , and thus the underlying graph has certain sparsity properties . to exploit such properties ,",
    "we further aggregate the graph so that each group either ( i )  has more internal links than those going outside or ( ii )  consists of just one page .",
    "the aggregation procedure is easy to implement , employing a simple criterion , and can be applied to graphs with any link structures .",
    "then , each group computes only one value in a decentralized manner via an enhanced version of the algorithms in @xcite .",
    "this value represents the total value of the group members .",
    "once this is computed , it can be distributed among the group members to determine their individual values .",
    "it is demonstrated theoretically and also through a numerical example that aggregation can reduce the computational cost while maintaining the accuracy and the convergence rate at a level similar to the non - aggregated full - order case .",
    "the aggregation technique is particularly motivated by the singular perturbation analyses for large - scale systems in markov chains @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and multi - agent consensus type problems @xcite . it is important to note that common in these works is the strong assumption on interactions among groups , requiring _ all groups _ to have only limited ratios of outgoing links towards other groups .",
    "this would not hold for the web graph where pages with many external links may not be common but indeed do exist . in the proposed aggregation method ,",
    "such pages are treated as exceptions and are separated into groups of their own .",
    "we will later discuss the relation of our approach to those using singular perturbation techniques in more detail .",
    "aggregation for pagerank computation has also been explored to obtain acceptable approximation in @xcite by classical methods in the markov chain literature .",
    "the paper @xcite examines aggregation through extensive simulation using large data of the web .",
    "recent works on aggregation for markov chains can be found , e.g. , in @xcite . more generally , in the literature of complex networks",
    ", partitioning graphs into communities is a topic widely studied under various criteria for detecting communities ; see , for example , @xcite and the references therein .    from the viewpoint of",
    "distributed randomized approach , there are two new features in the current paper .",
    "first , the nodes initiate updates in a random manner as in the original algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the difference is that an updating page transmits its value only to the pages to which it has outgoing links ; this means that the extra data required in the previous algorithms on pages having incoming links towards this page becomes unnecessary .",
    "second , each node can further divide its linked pages into several groups and communicates with them separately under possibly different update probabilities .",
    "these features are useful to reduce the amount of the overall communication , especially for pages with many links .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first give a brief overview of the pagerank problem in section  [ sec : pagerank ] . in section  [ sec : prob ] , we introduce the approach for web aggregation and the communication protocol among agents and then formulate the problem of computing the pagerank values via web aggregation . in section  [ sec : agg ] , the main results on the aggregation - based algorithm are presented along with an analysis on error bounds .",
    "discussions on the relation to singular perturbation techniques are given in section  [ sec : sing ] . in section  [ sec : distributed ] , the distributed randomized approach is developed for the part of the proposed algorithm based on the reduced - order recursion .",
    "we provide a numerical example in section  [ sec : example ] to illustrate the results .",
    "the paper is finally concluded in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "parts of the results in this paper have appeared in preliminary forms in @xcite .",

    "a probability vector is a nonnegative vector @xmath8 such that @xmath9 .",
    "a matrix @xmath10 is said to be ( column ) stochastic if it is nonnegative and each column sum equals 1 , i.e. , @xmath11 for each @xmath12 .",

    "similarly , @xmath16 is the matrix with all entries being @xmath14 . the spectral radius of the matrix @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "in this section , the pagerank problem is briefly described based on , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "consider the directed graph @xmath18 representing a network of @xmath19 web pages .",
    "here , @xmath20 is the set of nodes corresponding to the web page indices while @xmath21 is the set of edges for the links among the pages .",
    "the node @xmath22 is connected to the node @xmath12 by an edge , i.e. , @xmath23 , if page @xmath22 has an outgoing link to page @xmath12 .",
    "the objective of the pagerank algorithm is to assign some measure of importance to each web page .",
    "the pagerank value of page @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the relation @xmath26 implies that page @xmath22 has higher rank than page @xmath12 .",
    "the pages are ranked according to the rule that a page having more links , especially those from important pages , becomes more important .",
    "this is done in such a way that the value of one page equals the sum of the contributions from all pages that have links to it .",
    "let the values be in the vector form as @xmath27^n$ ] .",
    "then , the pagerank vector @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29^n,~~{\\mathbf{1}}_n^t x^ * = 1 , \\label{eqn : xa : pr}\\ ] ] where the link matrix @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 if @xmath32 and 0 otherwise , and @xmath33 is the number of outgoing links of page @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the value vector @xmath28 is a nonnegative unit eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 of @xmath34 .    in general",
    ", for this eigenvector to exist and then to be unique , it is sufficient that the web as a graph is strongly connected @xcite , there exists a sequence of edges which connects node @xmath22 to node @xmath12 . ] .",
    "however , the web is known not to be strongly connected .",
    "thus , the convention is to slightly modify the problem as follows .",
    "first , to simplify the discussion , we redefine the graph , and thus the matrix @xmath34 , by bringing in artificial links for nodes with no outgoing links such as pdf files .",
    "this can be done by adding links back to the pages having links to such pages . as a result",
    ", the link matrix @xmath34 becomes a stochastic matrix , that is , @xmath35 for each @xmath12 .",
    "this implies that there exists at least one eigenvalue equal to 1 . to guarantee the uniqueness of this eigenvalue ,",
    "let @xmath36 be a parameter such that @xmath37 , and let the modified link matrix @xmath38 be defined by @xmath39 , where @xmath16 is the matrix whose entries are all 1 .",

    "s theorem @xcite , the eigenvalue 1 is of multiplicity 1 and is the unique eigenvalue with maximum magnitude .",
    "further , the corresponding eigenvector is positive .",
    "hence , we redefine the value vector @xmath28 by using @xmath40 as follows .",
    "[ def : pagerank ] the pagerank value vector @xmath28 is given by @xmath42^n,~~{\\mathbf{1}}_n^t x^ * = 1 .",
    "\\label{eqn : prvec}\\ ] ]    due to the large dimension of the link matrix @xmath40 , the computation of @xmath28 is difficult .",
    "the solution employed in practice is based on the power method given by the recursion @xmath43 where @xmath44 and the initial vector @xmath45 is a probability vector .",
    "the second equality above follows from the fact @xmath46 , @xmath47 . for implementation ,",
    "the form on the far right - hand side is important , using only the sparse matrix @xmath34 and not the dense matrix @xmath40 .",

    "in this section , we introduce the problem setting for the distributed computation of the aggregated pagerank . following the randomized distributed approach proposed in @xcite",
    ", we view the web as a network of agents having computation and communication capabilities .",
    "the focus here is to extend the distributed algorithm of @xcite so that it can be executed with reduced computation and communication to determine approximate values of the exact pagerank . in what follows ,",
    "we present the procedure for aggregation of the web and then introduce the communication protocol .      in the proposed approach",
    ", the original web is aggregated by assigning each page into a number of groups and then each group computes one value , which is the sum of the values of the group members .",
    "we aggregate the pages sharing the following three properties : ( i )  the pages are placed under the same host / server so that their values can be computed together .",
    "( ii )  each group has a sufficiently large number of internal links .",
    "more specifically , pages have more links within their own groups than those pointing at pages that belong to other groups having multiple members .",
    "( iii )  group members are expected to take similar values in pagerank ; this may be known from past computations and/or the link structure .",
    "we will show that the process of grouping can be done locally at each host .",
    "we develop a novel aggregation approach by exploiting sparsity properties that the web inherently has , as stated by ( ii ) above .",
    "the particular approach has a close relation to the singular perturbation analysis for large - scale systems with network structures @xcite .",
    "the method there however requires a stronger sparsity notion on the underlying graph , which seems difficult to expect in the web .",
    "hence , necessary modifications will be made in the approach .",
    "the relation among these papers will be discussed in section  [ sec : sing ] .",
    "first , partition the original web graph @xmath18 and construct the _ aggregated _ graph denoted by @xmath51 as follows :    1 .",
    "the node set is given by @xmath52 , and each node @xmath22 represents a partition set @xmath53 of @xmath54 , that is , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "we call the set @xmath53 a group of pages .",

    "to simplify the notation , without loss of generality , we assume that in the pagerank vector @xmath28 , the first @xmath67 entries correspond to the pages belonging to group @xmath68 , and the following @xmath69 entries are for those in group @xmath70 , and so on .",
    "we make the following assumption regarding the grouping .",
    "it says that each group should have a sufficiently small number of external links compared to internal ones .",
    "recall from that @xmath71 denotes the number of outgoing links of page @xmath22 , and let @xmath72 be the number of outgoing links from page @xmath22 to groups having more than one page .",
    "following @xcite , we define the _ node parameter _ @xmath73 of page @xmath22 by @xmath74    [ assump : delta]given the bound @xmath75 on node parameters , each group @xmath12 satisfies one of the following conditions :    1 .   for each page @xmath22 in group @xmath12",

    "the objective is to compute the aggregated pagerank @xmath92 in a recursive fashion via information exchange only among groups .",
    "after this is completed , the second part @xmath93 should be obtained .",
    "it will be shown that in this stage , transmissions among pages in different groups is necessary , but only once during the execution of the algorithm .",

    "[ rem : group]for a given bound @xmath94 on the node parameters , a simple grouping procedure for assumption  [ assump : delta ] to hold can be described as follows .",
    "the pages are initially grouped based on their hosts , so the computation of the node parameters @xmath73 in can be done locally . any page @xmath22 whose @xmath73 does not satisfy the condition ( i ) is taken out from the group ; such pages are treated as single groups , for which the condition ( ii ) applies .",
    "other pages still belong to the same group , and thus their parameters @xmath73 are updated and then checked whether ( i ) holds for this new group .",

    "it should be noted that there is a tradeoff between the parameter @xmath94 and the number @xmath58 of groups : smaller @xmath94 implies larger @xmath58 , and vice versa .",
    "we next discuss the communication among groups in the proposed distributed algorithm .    for the computation of @xmath95 , the groups send their values to linked groups . here , we employ a gossip - type protocol , where the groups decide to communicate with their linked neighbors at random times .",

    "the steady state of this scheme is the transformed pagerank vector @xmath89 given in .",
    "now , to derive an approximated version of the update scheme above , we focus on the characteristics of the submatrices @xmath120 .",

    "proof:_(i ) let @xmath319 be the @xmath22th column of @xmath320 and further let @xmath321 be a vector containing only those elements corresponding to the nodes in @xmath301 , i.e. , @xmath322 if @xmath323 and @xmath208 otherwise for @xmath324 and @xmath311 . notice that @xmath325 now , the @xmath22th column of @xmath315 depends only on @xmath326 ; so denoting this column by @xmath327 with @xmath328 , we have by @xmath329 where @xmath330 is the unit vector whose @xmath12th element is 1 and the rest are 0 .",
    "it is now clear that @xmath331 because by definition @xmath332 and @xmath333 by the choice of @xmath300 in .",
    "moreover , if @xmath302 , it follows that @xmath334 where we used the fact @xmath335 .",
    "it thus follows that each column of @xmath315 is nonnegative and the sum of the elements equals one ; this implies that this matrix @xmath315 is stochastic .",
    "( ii )  let @xmath336 be the @xmath22th column of the average matrix @xmath337 . by the distribution of @xmath312",

    "this holds for @xmath340 , and consequently we obtain @xmath318 .",
    "we next show that the aggregated pagerank vector @xmath289 can be expressed in terms of the distributed link matrices .",
    "recall that by definition , @xmath341 . from",
    ", we have that @xmath289 is the unique eigenvector of the the link matrix given by @xmath342 with the property @xmath343 . due to the proposition above",
    ", this characterization can be extended using the distributed link matrices @xmath344 .",
    "define the modified link matrices by @xmath345 , and their average by @xmath346        = ( 1-\\hat{m})\\overline{\\phi } + \\frac{\\hat{m}}{n}u{\\mathbf{1}}_r^t.\\ ] ] take the parameter @xmath347 as @xmath348    the following lemma is the aggregated version of lemma  3.3 in @xcite .",
    "[ lem : mbar]for the parameter @xmath347 given in , we have the following :    1 .   @xmath293 and @xmath349 .",
    "2 .   @xmath350 .",
    "the aggregated pagerank vector @xmath341 in is the unique eigenvector of the average matrix @xmath351 corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 .",
    "[ rem : mhat]it is interesting that the choice of @xmath347 in is different from @xmath36 , but is critical in establishing the lemma . in particular , noting that the average matrix @xmath351 is stochastic , we can guarantee that the average state @xmath352 $ ] of the update scheme in converges to the desired vector @xmath289 .",
    "this is because it follows the recursion @xmath353 where @xmath354 is a probability vector .",
    "we however emphasize that the state @xmath355 itself does not converge to the aggregated pagerank @xmath289 . to resolve this issue , it turns out to be essential to introduce the time average @xmath296 as we see next .",
    "we are in the position to derive a convergence result for the distributed scheme under the probability allocation in for the linked nodes .",
    "[ thm : erg2]consider the distributed update scheme in and . for any update probabilities @xmath356 $ ] , @xmath101 , @xmath357 , satisfying the conditions in , the aggregated pagerank @xmath289 can be obtained from the time average @xmath296 of the states @xmath355 in the mean - square sense as @xmath358 \\rightarrow 0 $ ] , @xmath50 .",
    "the proof of this theorem follows from noticing that , in theorem  3.4 of @xcite , to establish the mean - square convergence , the properties in proposition  [ prop : aq ] are sufficient . in other words , for convergence , only stochasticity of the link matrices and the average behavior of the update scheme are relevant .",
    "the type of convergence guaranteed by the theorem is known as ergodicity for stochastic processes @xcite . while the general results of @xcite can be applied for the proof , we have developed in @xcite a more specific one , which have been useful in extending the algorithm to incorporate a stopping criterion there .",
    "it was also shown there that the convergence rate is of order @xmath359 due to the time averaging .",
    "the distributed update scheme presented above has the following features : ( i )  the computation performed at each group @xmath22 includes the updates in the state @xmath295 in and the time average @xmath360 in .",
    "( ii )  the communication among the groups is local in the sense that each group communicates only over direct outgoing links , as seen from the link matrices in .",
    "( iii )  the amount of communication is determined by the process @xmath361 , which specifies the pattern in the interaction between the pages .",
    "( iv )  at any group , the update probabilities @xmath300 can be allocated to linked groups locally without information exchange among groups ; one global parameter is @xmath307 , which is critical for the convergence of the proposed algorithm .",
    "[ rem : links]compared to the original scheme in @xcite , a significant advantage of the one above is that the nodes need to communicate with neighbors only over outgoing links . the identity of such links is necessarily contained in their local data .",
    "this is observed in the link matrices @xmath362 in where only the columns of @xmath320 ( and not the rows ) corresponding to the indices @xmath326 taking values 1 are used .",
    "in contrast , in @xcite , the protocol is that the nodes send data over incoming links as well .",
    "consequently , we also stress that the implementation of this algorithm is simple",
    ". a closer look at the matrices @xmath362 suggests us that group @xmath12 should just send its current value with some weight to the linked groups , where their values are updated by simply adding up the values received at the time .",
    "hence , no memory is needed for storing values of other groups .",
    "this characteristic is realized by the assumption on stochasticity of the distributed link matrices .",
    "in contrast , such memory is necessary in algorithms using asynchronous iteration @xcite .",
    "in fact , the most recently received values of all groups having links to the group need to be stored .",
    "hence , the memory size is determined by the number of incoming links and may be large for popular groups .",
    "the convergence rate of this scheme can be discussed from the viewpoint of its average dynamics .",
    "as mentioned in remark  [ rem : mhat ] , the average state @xmath363 converges to the aggregated pagerank @xmath289 .",
    "because of the recursion , the asymptotic rate of convergence is exponential and is dominated by the the second largest eigenvalue @xmath364 of @xmath351 in magnitude . by lemma  [ lem : mbar](ii ) , this eigenvalue can be bounded as @xmath365 where the inequality holds because @xmath366 ; see @xcite .",
    "therefore , the convergence rate depends on the base probability @xmath307 in communication , i.e. , more communication implies faster convergence . on the other hand",
    ", it is interesting to observe that the bound above is independent of the choices of the individual update probabilities @xmath300 as well as the number @xmath58 of groups .    for the update probabilities @xmath300 to satisfy the conditions",
    ", one possible choice is the following : @xmath367 in this case , the probability for group @xmath22 to transmit information to some neighbor is in total equal to the base probability : @xmath368 .",
    "further , the probability for communicating with group in @xmath301 is proportional to the weights @xmath369 of the corresponding entries in the @xmath22th column of the link matrix @xmath320 .",
    "hence , the frequency of communication among groups with more links is higher .",
    "[ ex : agg3]we study the distributed algorithm based on the aggregated web in fig .",
    "[ fig : agg ] from section  [ ex : orig ] .",
    "let the communication be such that each group communicates with the neighbors separately and the update probabilities @xmath300 are chosen as in above .",
    "thus , for example , group  1 has two neighbor sets given by @xmath370 and @xmath371 .",
    "their update probabilities will become @xmath372 , resulting in the probability of no communication to be @xmath373 ; these probabilities are indicated in fig .  [",
    "fig : agg ] .",
    "group  2 also has two links , so let @xmath374 and @xmath375 . similarly to the case above , let the update probabilities be @xmath376 , @xmath377 , and @xmath378 . finally , the only link of group  3 is to group  2 , which forms the group @xmath379 .",
    "we can take @xmath380 and @xmath381 .",
    "the distributed link matrices @xmath382 in can be expressed as @xmath383 where each column is given as @xmath384 it is straightforward to check that the properties shown in proposition  [ prop : aq ] hold : each @xmath382 is a stochastic matrix and the average matrix @xmath337 satisfies the relation @xmath318 .",
    "in this section , we provide a numerical example to illustrate the aggregation - based approach .    we consider a web with 200 pages ( @xmath385 ) whose link structure was randomly generated with some level of sparsity .",
    "the connectivity matrix representing the links is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : matrixg ] , where the mark @xmath386 indicates the presence of a link from page @xmath12 to @xmath22 . here",
    ", we made 12 dense diagonal blocks , each of which consisting of 5 to 30 pages .",
    "further , there are two less dense blocks of pages 1 to 50 and pages 51 to 90 .",
    "these blocks are initially considered as groups .",
    "the first page in each dense block has links from all other pages in the same block , and in particular , pages 1 and 51 are given more incoming and/or outgoing links ; these pages will have high pagerank values as we will see .",
    "following the grouping procedure outlined in remark  [ rem : group ] , we first computed the node parameters @xmath73 for each page @xmath22 with respect to the groups described above ; these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_i ] .",
    "this parameter can be large when the corresponding page has many outgoing links as pages 1 and 51 .",
    "it can also be large when a page is in a small group , but has external links ; this is the case with pages 173 , 194 , and 195 .",
    "however , many pages have no external links , and hence the average value of @xmath73 is relatively small at 0.0260 .",
    "we remark that this average is similar to the value reported in @xcite , which is found from real web data when pages are grouped according to the hosts .",
    "the grouping procedure is determined by the bound @xmath94 on node parameters .",
    "the relation between @xmath94 and the number @xmath58 of groups is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numg_delta ] .",
    "the line in the figure is not necessarily nonincreasing and is in fact piecewise constant .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig : error_delta ] exhibits the relation between @xmath94 and the error in the approximated pagerank measured by @xmath387 .",
    "these two figures clearly show the tradeoff between accuracy in computation and the size of the problem : smaller @xmath94 implies smaller error but larger number @xmath58 of groups .    to see the errors in the pagerank of the individual pages , we plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pagerank_delta ] the true values @xmath388 and the approximated values @xmath389 for @xmath24 when @xmath390 is used by @xmath386 and @xmath391 , respectively .",
    "this computation was done with 71 groups ( @xmath392 ) .",
    "we observe that the error is small in general .    finally ,",
    "we applied the distributed randomized algorithm and for computing the aggregated pagerank @xmath289 and then the entire pagerank vector @xmath393 . here , for the gossip communication protocol , the grouping @xmath301 , @xmath340 , @xmath394 , of the neighbors is based on the original groups in the block structure of the connectivity matrices . furthermore , we set the update probabilities @xmath300 using the formula in with the base probability @xmath395 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : timeresp_psi ] , sample paths of the time average @xmath396 for groups 50 to 59 are shown in solid lines and the true values @xmath397 of the aggregated pagerank in dashed lines .",
    "it is clear that the time average converges to the true value .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the convergence performance of this reduced - order scheme is similar to the case without aggregation . to make a fair comparison , we computed the state @xmath109 obtained from the time average @xmath396 and then its overall error from the true pagerank @xmath28 .",
    "we plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeresp_err ] the 1-norm of @xmath398 by the solid line .",
    "then , the same error was computed from the time average of the full - order scheme , which can be obtained by setting the node parameter very small as @xmath399 ; the result is shown by the dashed line in the same plot .",
    "the convergence rates as well as the achieved error levels at the final time are comparable for the two cases .",
    "the reduced - order case is clearly advantageous since it requires less operation as we have discussed in remark  [ rem : comp ] .",
    "more concretely , in the example considered here , the numbers of nonzero entries for the link matrices @xmath400 and @xmath401 are , respectively , @xmath402 and @xmath403 . in view of table  [ table : operation ] , the difference in computation costs is evident .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a distributed randomized algorithm for obtaining the pagerank values which performs well with reduced computation and communication loads .",
    "the approach is based on a novel aggregation technique of the web .",
    "first , we have proposed a simple procedure for grouping pages under the criterion of node parameters .",
    "then , the notion of aggregated pagerank has been introduced , based on which approximates of the true values for individual pages can be computed .",
    "error bounds on the approximation level have been derived .",
    "moreover , we have developed the distributed randomized algorithm of lower order for the computation of aggregated pagerank .",
    "the advantage of the approach in terms of computation cost as well as convergence properties have been discussed in detail and also demonstrated by a numerical example .    in the future , we will further study aggregation - based methods for pagerank to improve the convergence rate of the update scheme and the effects of incorporating multi - level groupings . more generally , for large - scale systems , the concept of aggregation is of great importance and may provide useful tools for other interesting problems such as smart grid for power distribution .",
