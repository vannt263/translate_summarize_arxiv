    "the angular power spectrum of primordial anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has become an important tool in the era of `` precision cosmology '' . since the first statistical detection of cmb fluctuations on large angular scales ( @xmath8 ) by the @xmath9-dmr instrument ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ) , several experiments have detected acoustic peaks in the power spectrum in the @xmath2-range @xmath10 ( lee et al .",

    "2002 ; halverson et al . 2002 ; benot et al . 2003 ; scott et al . 2003 ) and a fall - off in power at high @xmath2-values ( dawson et al . 2002 ; grainge et al . 2003 ;",
    "kuo et al . 2004 ; readhead et al . 2004 ) .",
    "more recently , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe , henceforth @xmath11 , has provided unprecedented measurements over the @xmath2-range @xmath12 ( bennett et al .",
    "2003a ; hinshaw et al .",
    "the wmap 1-year power spectrum is cosmic variance limited up to @xmath13 and delineates the first 2 peaks at @xmath14 and @xmath15 with exceptional signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the new data have provided detailed cosmological information on a wide range of parameters ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) and have raised new questions to be answered .",
    "however , the angular resolution of @xmath11 limits the power spectrum to @xmath16 . at high @xmath2-values ,",
    "the origin of the excess power initially observed by the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) at @xmath17 ( mason et al .",
    "2003 ) has also generated much interest .",
    "it is clear that the high-@xmath2 cmb power spectrum is one of the challenges for future cmb experiments including the esa planck satellite ( tauber 2001 ; lawrence 2003 ) due for launch in 2007 .    the very small array , henceforth the vsa ( watson et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter paper  i ) , is a purpose - built radio interferometer that has measured the cmb angular power spectrum between @xmath18 and 900 in a compact array configuration ( scott et al .",
    "2003 , paper iii ) and more recently up to @xmath19 in an extended array ( grainge et al .",
    "this paper describes the complete set of extended array data observed during october 2001 @xmath20 june 2003 .",
    "the data cover a larger area of sky than those analysed by grainge et al .",
    "( 2003 ) by adding more pointings to the previous vsa fields and by observing 4 new fields .",
    "we use mosaicing techniques to increase the sensitivity , reduce the sample variance and to facilitate finer @xmath2 resolution @xmath20 or equivalently reduce correlations between @xmath2 bins @xmath20 over the range @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : extended_array ] summarises the telescope parameters and the extended array configuration . in section  [ sec : abs_and_data ]",
    "we describe the observations , data reduction and calibration of the data , including a range of data checks . in section [ sec :",
    "foregrounds ] we discuss the various foregrounds , particularly discrete radio sources , and the corrections that were made to the data .",
    "the main results , cmb mosaic maps and cmb power spectrum covering @xmath22 , are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "a morphological analysis of the power spectrum is given in section  [ sec : ps_gaussians ] .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] is a discussion of the results and comparisons with other data , followed by conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the cosmological interpretation of these data , both on their own and combined with other data , is described in a companion paper ( rebolo et al .",
    "the vsa is a 14-element interferometer operating in the ka - band ( @xmath23 ghz ) situated at the high and dry site of the el teide observatory , in tenerife , at an altitude of 2340  m ( see paper  i ) .",
    "each antenna comprises a conical corrugated horn feeding a paraboloid mirror and mounted anywhere on a @xmath24-m@xmath25-m tip - tilt table located in a metal enclosure to minimise ground emission . due to the geometry of the table and enclosure ,",
    "the vsa declination range is restricted to @xmath26 to @xmath27 . in the `` compact '' configuration ( taylor et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter paper  ii ) , the mirrors were 143-mm in diameter giving a primary beam of @xmath28 fwhm at 34  ghz .",
    "the `` extended array '' , described here , has larger 322-mm diameter apertures allowing longer baselines while maintaining a high filling factor and therefore high temperature sensitivity .",
    "the longer baselines increase the angular resolution while the larger horns give a primary beam of @xmath29 fwhm at 33  ghz .",
    "this configuration has a total of 91 baselines with lengths ranging from 0.6  m to 2.5  m as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : array_config ] .",
    "the maximum possible baseline length , set by the extent of the main tip - tilt table , is considerably higher with lengths up to @xmath30  m. however , for the data presented here , we chose a limited range of lengths to maximise the overall temperature sensitivity of the array , will be utilised in future cmb observations with the vsa . ] .",
    "this still allows a wide range of angular scales to be measured but with well - sampled @xmath31 coverage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : array_config ] ) , which in turn provides good sampling of the power spectrum in @xmath2 and mapping with high fidelity .",
    "the filling factor of this configuration is @xmath32 times greater than that of the compact array , leading to an increase in the overall temperature sensitivity of the array .",
    "the vsa has so far operated in a single channel with instantaneous band - width of 1.5 ghz .",
    "we chose to use the higher end of the band ( @xmath33  ghz ) to minimise foregrounds since the minimum contamination for total - power measurements is at @xmath34  ghz ( banday et al .",
    "2003 ; bennett et al .",
    "2003b ) . with an average system temperature of @xmath35 k",
    ", the vsa achieves an overall instantaneous point source sensitivity of @xmath36 jy s@xmath37 .",
    "this corresponds to a temperature sensitivity , over a synthesized beam area ( @xmath38  sr ) of @xmath39  mk  s@xmath37 .",
    "note that the exact conversion from flux density to temperature depends on the beam area and on the @xmath31 coverage which in turns depends on the declination and the flagging / filtering of the visibility data .",
    "a typical vsa field at declination @xmath40 gives a total @xmath2-range of @xmath41 and a naturally weighted synthesized beam of fwhm @xmath42 arcmin over a @xmath43 field - of - view .",

    "an important application of cmb maps is to look for the signature of any non - gaussian structures which may be foregrounds or primordial in origin , such as cosmic strings which would appear as a discontinuity on a map , or a sze which would produce a negative temperature against the cmb .",
    "the largest foreground component for the vsa is discrete sources .",
    "the stronger sources can be identified in the raw vsa maps , before source subtraction .",
    "they show up as large positive temperatures in the maps , although they can coincide with negative cmb features ( or noise ) , making faint sources difficult to identify in the sky maps .",
    "a comparison of an un - subtracted map with one that has had sources removed is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sources_compare ] .",
    "these maps have been deconvolved with the clean algorithm to optimise detection of discrete sources . in vsa6e",

    "the r.m.s .",
    "noise in the data is @xmath44  mjy .",
    "the requirement for accurate source subtraction , as used by the vsa , is evident .",
    "the vsa maps allow a comparison to be made with other cmb data . the recent wmap data release ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) has provided 5 all - sky maps at frequencies centred at 22.8 ( k - band ) , 33 ( ka - band ) , 40.7 ( q - band ) , 60.8 ( v - band ) and 93.5  ghz ( w - band ) with resolutions ranging from 49.2  arcmin ( k - band ) to 12.6 arcmin ( w - band ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of wmap data at the vsa resolution is @xmath45 and hence much of the cmb signal is lost in the noise .",
    "the actual noise level in the wmap data depends on position due to the scanning strategy of the wmap satellite . for the 1-year wmap data release ,",
    "the noise is @xmath46k per @xmath47  arcmin pixel in the vsa regions , compared to @xmath48k in the vsa mosaiced maps .",
    "the wmap team provide their own foreground - cleaned cmb maps by combining all the wmap channels and optimising the individual weights to a cmb signal .",
    "however , the resolution is constrained by the k - band channel at a resolution of 49  arcmin .",
    "more recently , tegmark , de oliveira - costa & hamilton ( 2003 ) have produced a foreground - cleaned cmb map at the resolution of the highest frequency channel ( 12.6  arcmin ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vsa1_tegmark ] , we compare the vsa data for region vsa1 , with the foreground - cleaned cmb map of tegmark et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , based on wmap 1-year data at a resolution of @xmath47  arcmin .",
    "the colour scale uses the same range ( @xmath49 to @xmath50k ) as that used in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps1 ] . some features , both positive and negative ,",
    "can be seen on both maps .",
    "the correlation is however restricted due to the larger noise level in the wmap map for this field .",
    "the minimum and maximum values for these maps are typically @xmath51k , while for the vsa maps the minimum and maximum values are @xmath52k , in agreement with simulated cmb maps based on the concordance model and a noise level of @xmath53k . fig .",
    "[ fig : vsa1_tegmark ] also shows the sfd98 @xmath54 m dust map , smoothed to 11  arcmin resolution .",
    "for the vsa1 region , which contains moderate dust emission , there are no obvious galactic signals in either the vsa or wmap data for this region .",
    "it is evident that the strongest galactic emissions are on large angular scales ( @xmath55 ) , at least at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "in general , the vsa maps are consistent with each other with no obvious sign of contamination from foregrounds or other correlated signals .          the vsa power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ) clearly shows the existence of the first three acoustic peaks and the exponential fall - off in power towards higher @xmath2 .",
    "the wmap all - sky data provides measurements limited by cosmic variance , at @xmath57 . at moderate to high @xmath2 values ( @xmath58 )",
    "there are fewer measurements of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "recently , the acbar and cbi instruments have released new results which extend the @xmath2-range further .",
    "the morphological analysis presented in section  [ sec : ps_gaussians ] also suggests very good agreement between experiments , particularly on the 1st and 2nd peaks . the slight discrepancy in the amplitude of",
    "the third peak might suggest a change in the cosmological model .",
    "however , since the discrepancy is between low and high frequency data , it is possible that this could be a consequence of some systematic effects either in the lf or hf data .",
    "an important aspect of these results is the improved absolute calibration .",
    "we have used the wmap brightness temperature for jupiter resulting in a reduction of the vsa values by @xmath59 per cent and an absolute uncertainty of @xmath60 per cent in the power spectrum .",
    "interestingly , with the new calibration scheme , the vsa data are slightly lower in amplitude , at least over the @xmath2-range @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , if we had used the original calibration scheme , we would be in closer agreement to the 1-year wmap power spectrum .",
    "we find that the best - fitting scaling factor is @xmath62 i.e. the new vsa data are lower than the wmap data by @xmath63 .",
    "foregrounds in the vsa data are expected to have a negligible effect on the final power spectrum .",
    "the brighter sources have already been subtracted prior to power spectrum estimation ( section  [ sec : source_subtraction ] ) .",
    "the statistical corrections for residual sources and the galactic foreground are relatively small as depicted in fig.[fig : ps ] .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the residual sources are becoming significant in the highest @xmath2-bins .",
    "this emphasises the need for deeper source surveys if we are to accurately measure cmb fluctuations at @xmath64 . on the other hand ,",
    "the diffuse galactic foregrounds are stronger at low @xmath2-values . in the @xmath2-range covered here , the foreground maps in the vsa regions suggest typical galactic signals of a few tens of @xmath65k@xmath66 at @xmath67 compared to the cmb at @xmath68k@xmath66 .",
    "the exception to this is vsa5 , and to a lesser extent vsa1 . the location of these fields ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : field_positions ] ) explains why the foreground estimates ( table  [ tab : gal_foregrounds ] ) are higher than in the other fields .",
    "the diffuse foregrounds may indeed be stronger ( @xmath53k@xmath66 ) in these fields but they still are below the cmb anisotropies ( @xmath68k@xmath66 ) .",
    "this is verified by the fact that there are no obvious foreground signals seen either in the vsa maps or in the individual power spectra for each field . moreover",
    ", the relative weights of the different vsa fields means that the combined power spectrum would still remain virtually unaffected @xmath20 vsa5 contributes just 5 per cent to the total weight of the data as a whole .",
    "this is a major advantage of observing a number of independent fields before combining them to increase the signal - to - noise ratio in the power spectrum .",
    "as for other systematics , the data from each individual field are tested using a bayesian joint power spectrum and non - gaussianity estimation discussed in rocha et al .",
    "this method operates directly on the visibilities and , as such , is ideally suited to the detection of any residual systematics ( savage et al .",
    "additionally , the method properly accounts for the presence of noise in the data , making it extremely sensitive to any non - gaussian signal .",
    "however , we find no evidence of significant residual systematics in the data .",
    "we have presented high sensitivity and foreground subtracted measurements of the cmb power spectrum up to @xmath69 observed with the vsa . the cosmological interpretation is described in a companion paper ( rebolo et al .",
    "the final extended array data set contains a factor of @xmath30 more than those presented by grainge et al .",
    "the sky - coverage has increased by a factor of @xmath70 utilising 4 additional 3-field mosaics and increasing the original 3-field mosaics to 7-field mosaics , resulting in a significant increase to the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "mosaicing techniques allow for smaller correlations between adjacent bins and hence , can give finer resolution in @xmath2 .",
    "however , in this paper we have used the same binning scheme as grainge et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for comparison and to reduce the bin - bin correlations ; the @xmath2 resolution is @xmath71 .",
    "we adopt a new absolute calibration scheme based on jupiter temperature measurements with wmap to give a 3 per cent accurate absolute scale in the power spectrum .",
    "this reduces absolute values by 4 per cent in temperature or 8 per cent in the power spectrum compared to previous vsa data .    the vsa power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ) is in good agreement with data from other cmb experiments .",
    "there are now good signal - to - noise detections of the first 3 peaks in the cmb power spectrum and a damping tail at high @xmath2 which continues to @xmath72 .",
    "the different instruments have different potential systematic problems and they cover a wide range of frequencies .",
    "the agreement therefore indicates that none of the experiments are seriously contaminated by foreground emission or other systematic effects ( see also griffiths & lineweaver ( 2004 ) ) . from the analysis of the peak structure ( section  [ sec : ps_gaussians ] ) , there is extremely good agreement on the peak structure between experiments , except for a slight discrepancy in the amplitude of the 3rd peak which may have important consequences for the cosmological models .",
    "the slight discrepancy ( @xmath73 ) in the overall scaling between vsa and wmap may also be an important factor in terms of fitting cosmological models .",
    "this is discussed by rebolo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in the near future",
    ", the vsa will be reconfigured with even larger horns and longer baselines .",
    "it will allow the vsa to increase the @xmath2-range even further , up to a maximum of @xmath74 , while maintaining good @xmath2 resolution without loss of overall temperature sensitivity .",
    "the assistance of high frequency radio source surveys , to identify and measure the flux densities of sources over large areas of sky , will be a crucial role in keeping the discrete source foregrounds under control .",
    "the one centimetre receiver array ( ocra ; browne et al . 2000 ) , a prototype multi - beam receiver system currently begin tested on the torun 32  m telescope , will be ideal for such purposes .",
    "moreover , ocra is currently operating at @xmath75  ghz and hence direct source subtraction , without the need to extrapolate to other frequencies will be possible in the near future .",
