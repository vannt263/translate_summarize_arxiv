    "among the many results obtained with the renormalization group , two of the most famous are certainly the asymptotic freedom of qcd and the non - trivial ir behavior of scalar field theories below the critical dimension , due to the presence of a wilson - fisher fixed point .",
    "however , the two phenomena are hard to find in the same system : the non - trivial ir behavior of qcd is due to confinement , not to an ir fixed point , and the marginal couplings of scalar field theories do not go to zero in the uv , running instead into landau poles .",
    "one example of coexistence is provided by gauge theories with @xmath3 massless fermions , with @xmath3 close to the critical number above which asymptotic freedom is lost : in such case one finds the so - called banks - zaks fixed point @xcite .",
    "however , such a fixed point is not a generic feature of gauge theories , it exists only for a restricted range of parameters .",
    "more recently , a new class of field theories has emerged which appears to enjoy asymptotic freedom in quite some generality , and for which we will show here another case of its coexistence with a wilson - fisher fixed point .",
    "such theories are known as tensorial group field theories ( tgfts ) .",
    "tgfts are a particular case of group field theories ( gfts ) @xcite , a class of field theories defined on a group manifold , whose non - local interactions give a complex cellular structure to the feynman s graphs of the perturbation theory .",
    "such a structure is particularly interesting for quantum gravity , because it provides a tool for summing over manifolds . in their simplest form , and historically their original one , they appear as generalizations of matrix models @xcite to higher dimensions , in the form of _ tensor models _ @xcite .",
    "the most fruitful form of these models are the colored tensor models , for which an expansion in @xmath4 , similar to the one for matrices , has been constructed by gurau and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "such results boosted a fast expansion in this direction ( e.g. @xcite references therein ) .",
    "proper gft models can be seen as enrichments of tensor models with group - theoretic data .",
    "they originated in the context of topological field theory @xcite , and they were further developed because of their links with loop quantum gravity @xcite and spin - foam models @xcite .",
    "lastly , tgfts can be seen either as an enrichment of the colored tensor models by the addition of group variables , or alternatively as gfts whose interactions show the same structure and the same unitary invariance as the interactions of the colored tensor models .",
    "such particular models will be studied in this paper , by means of a specific example .    from the quantum gravity point of view ,",
    "one of the main challenges of gfts is to understand how the quantum degrees of freedom organize to form a geometric structure which can be identified with a semi - classical space - time ( a challenge that gft share with loop quantum gravity @xcite ) . in this quest",
    ", the physics of phase transitions seems to be a promising route . in the most widely admitted scenario @xcite , and",
    "according to recent works @xcite , these phase transitions should correspond to the condensation of quanta corresponding to the fields involved in the gfts .",
    "this phenomenon , very similar to the bose - einstein condensation , implies the spontaneous acquisition of a nonzero value by the mean field ( something similar has been explored recently also in tensor models @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "the help of the renormalization machinery , which perfectly matches with the gfts formalism , is invaluable @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of gfts @xcite and tgfts @xcite has been studied for several years , and the tgfts ( with non - trivial propagator ) are the only models found so far which allow to build rigorously a renormalization program , a success mainly due to the loosening of the ultra - locality of usual gfts , and to the tensorial nature of the interactions .",
    "this leads to a new notion of locality , called `` traciality '' , which enables one to clearly define the contraction notion of a high graph @xcite . for now ,",
    "several approaches have been followed , especially perturbative ones , and some characteristics of these models start to emerge .",
    "one of them is their asymptotic freedom , which has been discovered by ben geloun and his collaborators by perturbative calculations @xcite , and which seems to be a generic characteristic of tgfts @xcite .",
    "another aspect is the presence of non - trivial fixed points , which started being explored only recently by means of the functional renormalization group ( frg ) @xcite and the @xmath5-expansion @xcite .",
    "the frg is a widely used formulation of the wilsonian rg , with a vast range of applications @xcite . for many purposes its most convenient formulation is in terms of the effective average action , which satisfies what is often called the wetterich equation @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the frg is that it allows to explore different approximation methods that do not necessarily rely on having a small coupling constant , and thus are particularly interesting in the search of non - trivial fixed points .",
    "it is precisely for such reason that we will employ here the frg machinery , following the path opened by its application to matrix models @xcite and tgfts @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will further develop the frg approach to tgfts , by studying the case of a just renormalizable abelian tgft @xcite .",
    "after briefly reviewing tgfts in section [ sec : tgfts ] , and the frg construction at the beginning of section [ sec : frg ] , we will obtain , by the end of section [ sec : frg ] , a closed system of differential equations which describe the renormalization group flow of the model . in sections",
    "[ sec : large - s ] and [ sec : small - s ] , we will study the occurrence of fixed points and phase transitions in two different approximate regimes , corresponding to the deep uv and deep ir , or to the limit in which the radius of the group manifold goes to infinite and zero , respectively .",
    "we will summarize and discuss our findings in section [ sec : concl ] , leaving the connection to the perturbative calculations for the appendices .",

    "the true peculiarity of tgft models lies in the non - local form of the interactions contained in @xmath26 , which are built as follows .",
    "the convolution of the fields follows the outline of index contractions from the interactions of the uncolored tensor models @xcite : group elements are contracted ( i.e. identified and integrated over the group ) pairwise , such that an element appearing as the @xmath27-th argument of a @xmath12 is contracted with an element appearing as the @xmath27-th argument of a @xmath13 . a pattern of contracted fields is sometimes referred to as a _",
    "bubble_. what makes the bubbles non - local is both the restriction to pairwise identification and the fact that a given field can contract different arguments to different fields . while the interactions are non - local on the group , the pairwise contraction allows the definition of a new locality principle , known as _",
    "traciality _ , essential for the renormalization . in the lattice gauge field theory language",
    ", traciality means essentially that , for all the leading order graphs , flat holonomies imply necessarily trivial connection @xcite . in the case that @xmath7 is the abelian group @xmath28 , this amounts to imposing invariance under a formal unitary symmetry , the limit for @xmath29 going to infinity of the uncolored tensor models @xmath30 invariance .",
    "the interactions are formed by all the possible index contractions compatible with the @xmath30 invariance , i.e. they are formed by the pairwise contraction described above , with no insertion of external functions or operators on the group .",
    "we refer to these interactions as _ invariant traces _ : @xmath31:=\\sum_{b}\\lambda_b{\\mathrm{tr}}_{b}[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi],\\ ] ] where @xmath32 labels each contraction possible , involving an arbitrary number of fields , and is associated to the coupling @xmath33 .",
    "those contractions are graphically represented by bipartite colored graphs , whose vertices , black or white , are associated to the fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and whose lines correspond to the contracted field indices . for example , the graph of figure [ fig1 ] below ,     [ fig1 ]    corresponds to the following rank-6 interaction : @xmath34d^6[g']\\psi(g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4,g_5,g_6)\\bar{\\psi}(g'_1,g_2,g_3,g_4,,g_5,g_6)\\psi(g'_1,g'_2,g'_3,g'_4,g'_5,g'_6)\\bar{\\psi}(g_1,g'_2,g'_3,g'_4,g'_5,g'_6).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] other examples of bubbles are given on figure [ fig2 ] , for various ranks .",
    "there is obviously only one bubble constructible out of two fields , represented in the last graph of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this is the only local interaction in the usual sense , it corresponds to a mass term , and it is often included directly in the covariance .",
    "all the other interactions arise from the multiplication of fields at different points in @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig2 ]    in the tgft models , a specific symmetry is often imposed at the level of the field variables , known as the closure constraint , which reads @xmath36    this gauge symmetry is part of the physical enrichments added to purely tensorial models in the gft context and it can be interpreted as geometrical data",

    "the choice of the covariance @xmath11 must respect this invariance and must enforce it at the level of the feynman graphs .",

    "in fact , as pointed out in @xcite , and as usual in the presence of an external scale @xcite , this is the reason why we will obtain non - autonomous rg flow equations .",

    "note that , as we have seen in section [ sectiongaussian ] , moving infinitesimally away from the critical dimension one loses asymptotic freedom , but a new non - trivial fixed point emerges from the gaussian one .",
    "such merging or splitting of fixed points near the critical dimension is a standard phenomenon , but it has nothing to do with the fixed points , which appear precisely at the critical dimension .",
    "contrary to that , this is not a standard phenomenon , and it has to be attributed to the non - local structure of the tgft interaction .    the numerical integration of the large-@xmath130 flow leads to the phase diagram of figure [ fig10 ] , which shows again a strong resemblance to the one found in @xcite .",

    "more precisely , the region above the irrelevant trajectory at the ngfp can be interpreted as a symmetric phase , with coupling and mass of the same sign , and the region below this irrelevant trajectory as a broken phase , with negative mass and positive coupling .    within the present truncation ,",
    "our conclusion about the existence of such non - trivial fixed point is only valid in the large cutoff limit , i.e. in the uv limit .",
    "therefore , the occurrence of a non - trivial behavior associated to the broken phase , rests upon the survival of such fixed point in the ir , and this is why we will study the counterpart of the regime studied in this section , the small cutoff limit , in the next section .",
    "when the cutoff becomes very small , @xmath351 , all the sums obtained in [ sectiongfe ] reduce to a single element , the zero mode @xmath352 . in this limit , for the sums defined in and",

    ", we find the matrix : @xmath367 with eigenvalues @xmath368 , giving one relevant and one irrelevant directions .",

    "the numerical integration of these flow equations give the figure [ fig11 ] below .",
    "note that in this ir regime the rescaling for mass and coupling does not correspond to the canonical one defined in section [ sectiondim ] .",
    "again , this is a consequence of the fact that at small-@xmath130 our model is essentially a zero dimensional field theory , and our rescaling matches exactly with the one expected for a such theory , by fixing to zero the dimension of the ( effective ) action , and @xmath265 the dimension of the mass parameter . indeed , by direct inspection of our truncation , we find @xmath93=4 $ ] .",
    "because no phase transition is expected for such model , we have found an essential indication for the symmetric phase restoration in our model , as it should be on a compact space . in the physics of phase transition , it is well known that phase transitions occur in the `` thermodynamic '' limit or , in other worlds , for a non - compact manifold .",
    "this limit , in our case , can be approached by restoring in our expressions the radius @xmath80 of @xmath1 , here always fixed to 1 , and by sending this radius to infinity .",
    "such non - compact limit has been recently studied in @xcite , confirming the fact that in such limit one is left with a picture identical to the large-@xmath130 regime , and thus with a non - trivial phase transition .",
    "we have not extended our results in the intermediate cutoff regime , between small and large cutoff , but being the two asymptotic regimes qualitatively very similar to the ones in @xcite , we expect the intermediate regime to add no new qualitative insight with respect to the analysis performed there .",
    "in this paper we have developed the frg formalism for a just - renormalizable model of tgft on the compact group @xmath0 , and we explored two regimes of the flow , for large and small cutoff , which are more suitable to analytical and numerical study .    the lessons of our analysis can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , we have shown that the presence of the closure constraint can be incorporated in the frg formalism without too much pain .",
    "we have thus obtained a wetterich equation for this class of tgfts .",
    "second , from our analysis of a specific truncation , we have recovered in the uv limit the asymptotic freedom found perturbatively in @xcite for this model , and more generally observed for several tgfts models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the same limit , we have found a non - gaussian fixed point , of which we have studied the stability , and identified the critical directions .",
    "interestingly , this non - trivial fixed point has qualitatively similar characteristics to the wilson - fisher one , and it is associated to a phase transition in the flow diagram .",
    "lastly , in the ir sector , due to the compactness of the group manifold , we obtained an effectively zero - dimensional theory , and thus we have symmetry restoration in the deep ir .",
    "this is not a surprise , given the compact nature of the manifold .",
    "the compactness of space can be viewed as an additional regularization , to be removed in order to study the non - compact limit @xcite , or otherwise one can view the latter as the uv approximation , as we did here . in the non - compact limit one is left with just the large-@xmath130 regime of our analysis ( because @xmath369 , if @xmath80 is the radius of @xmath370 and @xmath371 the dimensionful rg scale ) , and thus with a non - trivial ir fixed point associated to a phase transition between a broken and a symmetric phase .",
    "overall , the above picture is strikingly similar to the one obtained in @xcite , and in part to the one in @xcite , despite the models having essential differences .",
    "the model in @xcite is in three dimensions , whereas our is in six ; the model in @xcite has no closure constraint , whereas our does ; and the model in @xcite has a kinetic term linear in momentum , whereas our is quadratic .",
    "these are all important differences , and the fact that the final result is nevertheless so similar points towards the greater importance that lies within the main similarity between the two models : the non - local melonic interaction .",
    "we are therefore tempted to conjecture that such tgfts with melonic interactions enjoy in quite some generality not only asymptotic freedom , but also a wilson - fisher - like fixed point .",
    "of course , the approximation we employed here is the simplest one , and making our result more solid will require studying larger truncations . and",
    "more models will need to be studied in order to understand whether our conjecture applies to all asymptotically free tgfts or only to some specific sub - class . grasping also at a more qualitative level how such feature arises",
    "( e.g. similarly to how asymptotic freedom is understood to arise from the wave function renormalization taking place already at one loop @xcite ) is also an open question .",
    "we are just at the beginning of the frg investigations of tgfts and hopefully these and other aspects will be clarified very soon .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to joseph ben geloun , daniele oriti , and vincent rivasseau , for many useful remarks during the preparation of this work , and on the final draft .",
    "in this section we review a well - known argument explaining why the one - loop beta function does not depend on the choice of the regularization , and we give an explicit example of this result for the computation of the beta function with frg method around the gaussian fixed point using a different regulator than the one used in the main part of the paper .",

    "therefore , under these assumptions , @xmath379 and @xmath380 , i.e. the one- and two - loop coefficients of the beta function , are scheme independent .",
    "note that if @xmath381 , the flow of @xmath373 is not autonomous , unless @xmath382 , or unless the @xmath130-dependence of @xmath383 is related to the beta function of another coupling .",

    "however , when expanding the beta functions around zero mass , the above argument must hold true also for the frg .      as we mentioned in section",
    "[ sec : frg ] , the choice of a cutoff function corresponds to a choice of coarse graining scheme .",
    "different choices thus affect the flow , but we expect that physical quantities , such as the critical exponents , will not depend on it . as we argued above , one such quantity is the one - loop coefficient of the beta function for the marginal coupling . to illustrate this point more explicitly , we choose here a different regulator : @xmath384 - 1}\\label{regulatorbis},\\ ] ] and study the large cutoff limit ( @xmath385 ) of the flow equations around the gaussian fixed point , in order to compare them with the ones obtained in section [ sectiongaussian ] . at the leading order in@xmath221 , i.e. discarding the derivative of @xmath223 , the derivative of the regulator writes as : @xmath386 ^ 2\\big(1-e^{-(z_s\\vec{p}\\,{}^2+m_s^2)/z_se^{2s}}\\big)^2.\\ ] ] following the same procedure as in section [ sectiongfe ] , we find the three equations : @xmath387 @xmath388_{k=0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath389 for each of these equations the leading order can be easily extracted .",

    "we will see in the next appendix that a different computation of the one - loop beta function , using yet another regularization , gives the same result .",

    "the third one is more interesting for us , as it gives the wave function renormalization @xmath401 , with : @xmath402      @xmath113 * 4-points function*. the first one loop corrections to the 1pi 4-point function involve three types of diagrams , but only those of the type depicted in figure [ fig13 ] contribute here . as for the tadpole of the previous calculation",
    ", they involve five internal faces , but a line more than tadpole graphs .",
    "hence , the power counting of these graphs gives a logarithmic divergence .",
    "the structure of the 1pi melonic 4-points function @xmath403is the following : @xmath404\\frac{1}{2}{\\mathrm{sym}}\\mathcal{w}^{(i)}_{\\vec{p}_1,\\vec{p}_2,\\vec{p}_3,\\vec{p}_4},\\ ] ] where : @xmath405 making use once again of and , we obtain @xmath406 and , at the leading order in @xmath83 : @xmath407\\sum_{i=1}^6\\frac{1}{2}{\\mathrm{sym}}\\mathcal{w}^{(i)}_{\\vec{p}_1,\\vec{p}_2,\\vec{p}_3,\\vec{p}_4}.\\ ] ]      @xmath113**beta function**. the previous equations and give the renormalization of the coupling and the field at the one - loop order .",
