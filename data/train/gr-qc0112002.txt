    "spin foam models have been proposed as candidates for a quantum theory of space - time geometry  @xcite and therefore form candidates for a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "spin foam models also play a central role in the construction of invariants of piecewise - linear three- and four - manifolds  @xcite .",
    "they arise as the models that are strong - weak dual to non - abelian lattice gauge theory  @xcite and form a possible starting point for the generalization of gauge theories from lie groups to quantum groups  @xcite . for reviews on the subject , see , for example @xcite .    a spin foam  @xcite whose symmetry group is a compact lie group @xmath6 , is an abstract oriented @xmath5-complex consisting of faces , edges and vertices , together with a colouring of the faces with representations of @xmath6 and a colouring of the edges with compatible intertwiners ( representation morphisms ) of @xmath6 .",
    "a spin foam model is a discrete model in the framework of statistical mechanics whose partition function is a sum over spin foams each of which is assigned a boltzmann weight . if the boltzmann weight factors into contributions for each vertex , edge and face , these factors are usually called vertex , edge and face amplitudes .    barrett ,",
    "crane and baez  @xcite have developed a particular spin foam model whose partition function can be understood as the sum over all quantized euclidean geometries that can be assigned to a given triangulation of a four - manifold . the spin foam model is usually defined on the @xmath5-complex dual to that triangulation .",
    "several versions of this model are studied in the literature  @xcite which differ in their boltzmann weights ( amplitudes ) , in particular in their edge amplitudes .",
    "some of the models are formulated on a fixed @xmath5-complex while others include a sum over @xmath5-complexes . in the following ,",
    "we call all these models barrett  crane models .    in this article",
    ", we study a generalized version which encompasses all interesting choices of amplitudes , but we restrict ourselves to a fixed @xmath5-complex .",
    "the partition function of our model is a sum over all possible assignments of _ balanced _",
    "irreducible representations of the lie group @xmath0 to the faces .",
    "the balanced representations are of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an irreducible representation of @xmath9 .",
    "they are also called the _ simple _ representations .",
    "each edge is then assigned a unique intertwiner , the barrett  crane intertwiner  @xcite .",
    "we allow quite generic edge and face amplitudes , but the vertex amplitude is always the generalized @xmath10-symbol  @xcite consisting of one barrett ",
    "crane intertwiner for each edge attached to the vertex .",
    "we make use of the fact that the barrett  crane intertwiner can be written in terms of an integral over the sphere @xmath2  @xcite and of the techniques familiar from the duality transformation for non - abelian lattice gauge theory  @xcite and derive a dual expression for the partition function of the barrett  crane model in which the fundamental variables are pairs of @xmath2-values associated to the edges .",
    "the partition sum is then given by an integral over @xmath2 for each of these variables .",
    "provided that the edge amplitude of the original model is of a particular form , the dual model has local interactions , its boltzmann weight factors into one contribution for each face , and it depends on the @xmath2-variables at the edges in the boundary of that face .",
    "this reformulation of the barrett ",
    "crane model has the following geometric interpretation if the @xmath5-complex is chosen to be dual to a triangulation of a four - manifold .",
    "the @xmath2-variables are then associated to the tetrahedra .",
    "they parameterize the ( normalized ) normal vectors of the hyperplanes spanned by the tetrahedra where the tetrahedra are locally embedded in @xmath3 .",
    "the factorized boltzmann weight provides an interaction term for each triangle so that the interaction depends on the @xmath2-values associated to all tetrahedra that contain the triangle in their boundaries .    however , there are two @xmath2-values associated to each tetrahedron one of which belongs to either one of the two four - simplices that contain the tetrahedron in their boundaries .",
    "this suggests that there exists an @xmath0-valued parallel transport along the tetrahedron which maps the first @xmath2-value to the second one .",
    "however , this parallel transport is defined only up to elements of @xmath0 that stabilize the first of the @xmath2-values .",
    "following this idea , we show that the barrett  crane model can be obtained from @xmath0 lattice @xmath4-theory ( the @xmath0 ooguri model  @xcite ) if we impose a constraint at the quantum level by averaging over this stabilizer in a suitable way .",
    "this means that of the @xmath0-valued parallel transport only the action of @xmath0 on @xmath2 is physically relevant .",
    "finally , we consider the boltzmann weight of the dual formulation of the barrett ",
    "crane model and list possible face and edge amplitudes for which the partition function is well defined ( not just divergent ) .",
    "we outline how one can analyze this model in the context of statistical mechanics , for example in order to study its ground state and fluctuations around it .",
    "in addition , one can expect that the dual formulation of the barrett  crane model is well suited for numerical studies .",

    "we review some mathematical background material on the algebra of representation functions of a compact lie group , we construct the spherical functions of @xmath2 , and we introduce our notation for abstract @xmath5-complexes . the barrett  crane model and @xmath0 lattice @xmath4-theory are introduced in section  [ sect_bcmodel ] . in section  [ sect_transform ]",

    "the interaction therefore depends only on the relative angles between the normal vectors of each pair of neighbouring tetrahedra , the so - called _",
    "dihedral angles_. two tetrahedra are neighbours with respect to a given triangle if they are contained in the boundary of the same @xmath266-simplex ( this is the same as saying that on the dual @xmath5-complex , two neighbouring edges contain a common vertex , but expressed in the language of the original triangulation ) .    however , there is the complication that each tetrahedron carries two @xmath2-variables , @xmath267 and @xmath268 . for a given triangle ,",
    "each of these values is involved in the interaction term : the first variable , @xmath267 , in association with one neighbour and the second variable , @xmath269 , with the other one , see figure  [ fig_geometry](a ) .",
    "the tetrahedron dual to @xmath156 therefore contributes with different @xmath2-values @xmath267 and @xmath269 depending on the four - simplex in which the interaction takes place .",
    "it is thus plausible to conjecture that there is some parallel transport associated to the tetrahedra which contains the information of how @xmath269 is rotated to @xmath267 when we transit from one four - simplex along a tetrahedron to a neighbouring four - simplex .",
    "the obvious candidate for the parallel transport is the transitive @xmath0-action on @xmath2 for which the @xmath0 element is , however , only defined up to an element in the stabilizer of a given point on @xmath2 . in section  [ sect_bcgauge ]",
    ", we reconstruct the @xmath0 parallel transport , and our intuition about the ambiguity due to the stabilizer is shown to be correct .",
    "the weight   resembles the character decomposition of a function on @xmath14 where the character decomposition can be understood as a generalization of fourier expansion .",
    "because of the geometric picture , the @xmath2-variables have a natural interpretation as variables conjugate to the representations labelling the faces  conjugate in the sense of the quantum mechanical uncertainty relation .",
    "if we suppose that the partition function can be interpreted as the trace over a suitable hilbert space , there are two pictures for the barrett  crane model in analogy to position and momentum basis in quantum mechanics : in the original formulation , the partition function is a sum over all possible quantized areas associated to the triangles where the areas are determined by the balanced irreducible representation of @xmath0  @xcite . if we are in a quantum state with definite areas of the triangles , the directions of the tetrahedra in @xmath3 which are represented by the @xmath2-variables and the corresponding dihedral angles , would be maximally uncertain .",
    "in addition to this ` area basis ' we also have a ` direction basis ' which is given by the dual partition sum .",
    "the dual partition sum is the integral over all possible @xmath2-directions of the tetrahedra . in a quantum state with definite directions ,",
    "however , we would expect a maximal uncertainty of the quantized areas assigned to the triangles .",
    "we have conjectured above that it is possible to find the parallel transports of an @xmath0 connection which , for each edge @xmath154 , map the first @xmath2-variable @xmath269 to the second one @xmath267 .",
    "this would mean that the barrett  crane model has some properties of an @xmath0 gauge theory and therefore enjoys the corresponding local symmetry . a suitable notion of local @xmath0 symmetry is the invariance of the boltzmann weight under a transformation which takes an arbitrary @xmath0 element for each vertex @xmath270 and transforms each edge variable @xmath257 depending on the group elements that have been chosen for the two vertices .",
    "let @xmath271 define a generating function . here",
    "@xmath272 represents a class of @xmath111 .",
    "the barrett  crane model   is invariant under the local transformations ,    @xmath273    by proposition  [ prop_su2action ] , this transformation involves the action of @xmath0 on @xmath2 for each of the @xmath2-variables at the given edge .    for a given face @xmath148 and a vertex @xmath190 , the transformation reads    @xmath274    so that @xmath275 is invariant .",
    "it is now possible to reconstruct @xmath0 parallel transports from the pairs of @xmath2-values .",

    "therefore for any @xmath280 , the action is , @xmath281    we wish to start with an @xmath0 gauge theory and then impose the condition that elements from these stabilizers are irrelevant .",
    "in other words , we wish to describe an @xmath0 gauge theory of which only the action of the parallel transport on @xmath2 is physically relevant .    technically , the key idea is to consider a representation function of @xmath0 whose argument is the @xmath0 element @xmath282 and to average over the stabilizer as parameterized in  .",

    "the new parameter @xmath338 and maybe the freedom to choose different edge amplitudes , also raise the question of whether and how we have to renormalize the model . from the above considerations",
    ", one might conjecture that the barrett  crane model had to be renormalized along the lines of lattice gauge theory .    the choice of a triangulation or of a dual @xmath5-complex for a given smooth manifold would correspond to a choice of coordinates , and the triangulation had to be ` fine ' enough ,  had to contain sufficiently many simplices , for the aspects we wish to study .",
    "an interesting question is certainly whether there exist long range correlations which would arise from local degrees of freedom of the model and correspond in some sense to the euclidean analogue of the graviton .",
    "long range is here referred to in a combinatorial sense ,  variables that are separated by many simplices should still be correlated .",
    "provided that such long range effective degrees of freedom exist , several scenarios are conceivable .",
    "first , we might have to tune or fine - tune @xmath338 or the edge amplitude in order to obtain an infinite or at least a very large correlation length .",
    "alternatively the model could be , at least for some range of parameters , in a coulomb like phase and exhibit correlations that decay with the reciprocal distance ( again in the combinatorial sense ) .",
    "this would provide a scenario in which there are always long range correlations and which is largely insensitive to the choice of parameters .",
    "after one has finally understood the spectrum of correlation lengths of the model in a combinatorial sense of ` length ' , one would have to reconstruct metric information from the data provided by the model so that , say in a suitable ` classical ' limit , the combinatorial correlations could be interpreted as correlation functions with respect to a metric distance .",
    "it is an interesting question how a fundamental length scale might arise in such an approach .",
    "finally , we mention that two versions of the barrett  crane model , @xcite with normalized intertwiner , and  @xcite , have edge amplitudes that do not factorize . in this case",
    ", the dual model   has a non - local boltzmann weight , and the classical ground state is no longer obvious and might even have better properties .",
    "this is a second possibility , besides quantum effects , how one could avoid the degenerate ground state .",
    "a more detailed study of the possible edge amplitudes of the dual model is in preparation .",
    "we have presented a reformulation of the euclidean barrett  crane model in terms of dual @xmath2-variables .",
    "the new variables have a geometric interpretation and can be understood as variables conjugate to the quantized areas .",
    "the fact that the dual model can be phrased in terms of continuous variables , prepares the ground for the application of a variety of analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "interesting are in particular the question of how the degenerate classical ground state can be regularized , maybe by quantum effects , maybe by a non - local boltzmann weight for the dual model or maybe only if we introduce a cosmological constant or couple gravity to matter .",
    "also important is the question of which correlations are relevant in the dual model .",
    "the possible choices of edge amplitudes and regularization parameters @xmath338 raise the question of whether and how one has to renormalize the theory .",
    "on the one hand , the model is not immediately triangulation independent , so that some refinement or sum over triangulations will be necessary . on the other hand ,",
    "the result ( however this will be achieved ) is expected to be background independent .",
    "this requires an entirely new interpretation of the renormalization procedure as opposed to what is familiar from the context of lattice gauge theory and statistical mechanics .",
    "we are confident that the reformulation presented here offers a framework in which these questions can be approached .",
    "the author is grateful to emmanuel college , cambridge , for a research fellowship .",
    "i would like to thank john barrett , mtys kardi , alan macfarlane , robert oeckl , daniele oriti , nuno romo , ruth williams and toby wiseman for many valuable discussions , for comments on the manuscript and on relevant literature .",
