    "magnetic reconnection is the driver of explosions in the solar corona .",
    "the first self - consistent description of magnetic reconnection , the sweet - parker model @xcite , was immediately recognized as yielding energy release rates too slow to explain observations .",
    "petschek reconnection @xcite and related models @xcite can be much faster , but requires anomalous resistivity @xcite , a process which is not well understood . in the past 10 - 15 years , a new paradigm of collisionless ( hall ) reconnection has emerged , in which non - magnetohydrodynamic terms make reconnection much faster @xcite , about six orders of magnitude faster for solar flare parameters .",
    "signatures of hall reconnection have been observed in magnetospheric observations @xcite and laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "however , explaining observed reconnection rates is only part of the problem .",
    "one must also explain why reconnection is explosive : explaining how magnetic energy can accumulate without significant dissipation and identifying the mechanism triggering the onset of fast ( hall ) reconnection to release the stored energy are long - standing problems .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that a catastrophic transition from sweet - parker to hall reconnection occurs when the width @xmath0 of the sweet - parker dissipation region falls below the ion skin depth @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ion plasma frequency and @xmath3 is the plasma density .",
    "this is the length scale at which magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) breaks down and the hall term in the generalized ohm s law becomes important . for @xmath4 , the sweet - parker solution ceases to exist , and an abrupt transition to hall reconnection ensues .",
    "the catastrophic transition to hall reconnection when @xmath5 was demonstrated by ( externally ) decreasing the resistivity @xmath6",
    ". however , the idea that a solar eruption is caused by a change in the resistivity by a large enough amount to cause a transition from collisional to collisionless reconnection requires ad hoc assumptions about the poorly understood energetics of the corona . in this letter",
    ", we suggest that the transition can occur as the result of the dissipation region thinning due to the convection of stronger magnetic fields into the dissipation region during slow sweet - parker reconnection .",
    "this is a generic process which is entirely self - driven : it relies on no external forcing or fine tuning of any parameters . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first self - consistent model for the spontaneous onset of fast reconnection .    to see why transitions to fast reconnection are generic to the reconnection process ,",
    "consider a macroscopic current sheet with a small but non - negligible resistivity . without small scale structure , the hall term in ohm s law is unimportant , so the system undergoes sweet - parker reconnection . since the resistivity is small , the dissipation region",
    "is embedded within the macroscopic current sheet . the width @xmath0 of the sweet - parker current layer",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the alfvn speed evaluated using the magnetic field @xmath9 just upstream of the dissipation region and @xmath10 is the macroscopic length of the sweet - parker current sheet . during reconnection",
    ", stronger magnetic field lines are convected into the dissipation region by the inflow , causing a decrease in the sweet - parker layer width . when the dissipation region becomes thinner than @xmath11 a transition ensues .    in the following section , we review the salient properties of sweet - parker and hall reconnection . in   [ sec - sims ] ,",
    "we describe the numerical simulations and their results , and we discuss implications for the onset of solar flares in ",
    "[ sec - disc ] .",
    "in the sweet - parker model @xcite , a steady state is reached when the convective inflow of magnetic field lines is balanced by diffusion of field lines towards the x - line , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the inflow speed . from continuity , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the outflow speed .",
    "therefore , the inflow alfvn mach number @xmath16 ( a measure of the reconnection rate ) is given by the right hand side of equation ( [ spd ] ) since @xmath17 .",
    "the extreme elongation of the dissipation region due to @xmath6 being very small for most plasmas of interest throttles sweet - parker reconnection . for solar flares ,",
    "the sweet - parker prediction of @xmath18 is far smaller than inferred from observations , where we used typical parameters of @xmath19 for the preflare density , @xmath20 for the preflare coronal magnetic field , @xmath21 for a typical flux tube length , and a classical resistivity of @xmath22 based on a temperature of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the physics of hall reconnection is fundamentally different from that of sweet - parker .",
    "the motion of ions decouples from that of the electrons and the magnetic field at a distance @xmath11 from the x - line .",
    "the electrons remain frozen - in to the magnetic field down to the electron skin depth @xmath24 .",
    "where the species are decoupled , the hall term in ohm s law introduces whistler and/or kinetic alfvn waves ( depending on the plasma @xmath25 ) into the system @xcite .",
    "both waves are dispersive with @xmath26 .",
    "the dispersive property of these waves causes the outflow jet from the x - line to open as discussed by petschek @xcite . in the absence of dispersive waves ,",
    "reconnection is slow as in the sweet - parker model .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite have shown that the inflow speed for steady - state hall reconnection is @xmath27 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath28 ) .",
    "this result has been found to be independent of electron mass @xcite , system size @xcite , and dissipation mechanism @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect a dramatic increase in the reconnection rate when a transition from sweet - parker to hall reconnection occurs .",
    "we perform numerical simulations using the massively parallel compressible two - fluid code f3d @xcite in a periodic two - dimensional domain .",
    "the initial equilibrium magnetic field is a double current sheet configuration given by one period of a sine sheet , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the size of the domain in the inflow direction , with pressure balance enforced by a non - uniform density profile , @xmath31 . here",
    ", @xmath32 is a constant corresponding to the density at the edge of the domain and @xmath33 is the temperature , assumed constant and uniform for simplicity .",
    "the initial density at the center of the current sheet is , therefore , @xmath34 .",
    "we impose no initial guide field .",
    "lengths are normalized to the ion skin depth @xmath35 based on the density @xmath32 at the edge of the computational domain , not the center of the x - line , which we denote as @xmath36 .",
    "magnetic field strengths , velocities , times , and resistivities are normalized to @xmath37 , the alfvn speed @xmath38 based on @xmath37 and @xmath32 , the ion cyclotron time @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the computational domain is of size @xmath41 with a cell size of @xmath42 .",
    "there is no viscosity , but fourth order diffusion with coefficient @xmath43 is used in all of the equations to damp noise at the grid scale .",
    "an electron mass of @xmath44 is used .",
    "although this value is unrealistic , the electron mass only controls dissipation at the electron scales which does not impact the rate of hall reconnection .",
    "a small coherent perturbation @xmath45 $ ] is used to initiate reconnection .",
    "the resistivity is taken to be uniform .",
    "simulations are performed with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , both of which exhibit transitions to fast reconnection .",
    "we present results from the @xmath46 simulation , which was initialized from the @xmath48 simulation at @xmath49 .",
    "initializing the simulation in this way introduces transient behavior , but it dies away ( by @xmath50 ) before small scale dynamics become important .    when the system is evolved in time",
    ", the hall effect is initially very small because the width of the current layer @xmath51 is large compared to @xmath36 , so the system evolves essentially as it would in pure resistive mhd .",
    "a sweet - parker current layer develops , as we will demonstrate later .",
    "the ion and electron inflow velocities , measured as the maximum value of the inflow into the x - line for each species , are plotted as a function of time late in the simulation in figure  [ spontplots]a .",
    "up until @xmath52 , the electrons and ions are coupled as expected in mhd .",
    "the inflow speed is very small , but is slowly rising due to a gradual increase in the upstream magnetic field strength @xmath9 as stronger magnetic fields are convected into the dissipation region .",
    "figure  [ spontplots]b shows the slow increase in @xmath9 , measured just upstream of the current layer in the simulation .",
    "when the ions decouple from the electrons , the inflow speeds begin to increase dramatically and the system begins a transition to hall reconnection .",
    "this transition initiates when the width of the current layer @xmath0 falls below @xmath36 , as is shown in figure  [ spontplots]c .",
    "the thick solid line is @xmath36 as a function of time .",
    "after decoupling , one must distinguish between the electron and ion current sheet widths , which we denote as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the solid line is @xmath53 , determined by the half width at half maximum of the total current layer .",
    "the dashed line is @xmath54 , determined by the greater of @xmath53 and the half width at half maximum of the total inflow current .",
    "the latter becomes non - zero where the electrons and ions decouple , and is therefore a measure of the edge of the ion dissipation region .",
    "one can see @xmath54 decreasing from large scales ( larger than @xmath36 ) as the upstream magnetic field increases , and the transition begins when it is of the order of @xmath36 .    finally , to verify that the system is undergoing sweet - parker before the transition , and hall reconnection after",
    ", we must check the validity of the inflow speed predictions from equations ( [ spresult ] ) and ( [ hallresult ] ) .",
    "the thick solid line of figure  [ spontplots]d shows @xmath13 as a function of time .",
    "the dashed line is the sweet - parker prediction from equation ( [ spresult ] ) ( @xmath55 in code units ) , while the thin solid line is the hall reconnection prediction with a constant coefficient of 0.17 , which is of the order of @xmath56 as expected from equation ( [ hallresult ] ) .",
    "clearly , up until about @xmath57 , there is excellent agreement with the sweet - parker result .",
    "a grayscale plot of the current layer during the sweet - parker phase ( at @xmath58 ) is shown in figure  [ cursheet]a , showing the characteristic elongated dissipation region ( similar to those observed with pure mhd simulations by @xcite ) . after a relatively brief transition time lasting until @xmath59 , the inflow speed is well modeled by the hall prediction .",
    "a grayscale plot of the current layer during the hall phase ( at @xmath60 ) is shown in figure  [ cursheet]b , showing the open outflow configuration characteristic of hall reconnection .",
    "we observe a large enhancement of the quadrupolar structure in the out of plane magnetic field , a signature of hall reconnection @xcite .",
    "cuts across the current sheet at the x - line normalized to its maximum value are plotted as the dashed line and dot - dashed lines in figure  [ cursheet]c , showing that @xmath53 falls to @xmath61 during hall reconnection , as is expected when electron inertia provides the dissipation . for comparison ,",
    "the solid line is a cut across the initial equilibrium current sheet .",
    "the spontaneous onset model presented here provides a possible explanation of why reconnection sites in weakly collisional plasmas are apparently quiet for a long time as magnetic energy accumulates before a sudden onset of fast magnetic reconnection releases it .",
    "a rigorous comparison of this model with flare observations is challenging because the dissipation regions associated with the transition to fast reconnection are much narrower than can be resolved with satellite or ground - based observations .",
    "we can , however , compare some basic predictions with observations .",
    "first , are macroscopic current sheets in the corona wide compared to the ion skin depth ? using values of the plasma parameters in a solar flare from   [ sec - spandhall ] gives an ion skin depth of only @xmath62 , far narrower than expected macroscopic current sheets in the corona . at present ,",
    "current sheets in the corona are inaccessible to observations , though reasonable scales for the current sheet width @xmath63 may be 100 - 1,000 km .",
    "second , taking @xmath6 as a given , what is the critical upstream magnetic field strength @xmath64 which would make the sweet - parker current layer width equal to @xmath11 ? setting @xmath65 in equation ( [ spd ] ) , we find @xmath66 using the values from   [ sec - spandhall ] .",
    "this is accessible during reconnection in the corona .",
    "third , what is the time scale for the quiet time @xmath67 , during which sweet - parker reconnection could be active but magnetic energy could accumulate ?",
    "since the field is frozen - in outside of the dissipation region , it is the time it takes for a field of strength @xmath64 to be convected in by the inflow , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the distance upstream from the x - line .",
    "this can be approximated using @xmath70 and by assuming a linear profile in the magnetic field @xmath71 in @xmath72 .",
    "integrating from @xmath73 to approximately zero gives @xmath74 where @xmath38 is the alfvn speed based on @xmath37 .",
    "the numerical factor is about 11 hours , which is a reasonable time scale for the accumulation of magnetic energy due to footpoint motion in the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the time it takes for the transition from sweet - parker to hall reconnection , corresponding to the time from onset until maximum flare signal , can be bounded above by the convective time across the sweet - parker current sheet @xmath75 , which at the transition time is the same as the resistive time across the layer @xmath76 and the convective time along the layer @xmath77 . for our simulation ,",
    "the resistive time is @xmath78 , which compares reasonably well with the observed time of the transition ( see figure  [ spontplots]d ) . for solar flare parameters ,",
    "the resistive time across the layer is approximately @xmath79 , which is comparable to the onset times seen in flares @xcite .",
    "the predicted observable parameters are quite consistent with solar flare phenomena .",
    "the present simulations do not include the effect of an out of plane ( guide ) field , the more generic configuration for magnetic reconnection .",
    "it was conjectured @xcite that the transition to fast reconnection in the presence of a guide field is also catastrophic , but occurs when the width of the current layer reaches the ion larmor radius @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the ion sound speed , instead of the ion skin depth @xmath11 .",
    "this is because @xmath82 is the scale where dispersive ( kinetic alfvn ) waves become important in the presence of a guide field @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent laboratory experiments at the versatile toroidal facility @xcite have observed spontaneous reconnection , and preliminary diagnostics suggest that the width of the current layer at onset is very close to their value of the ion larmor radius @xmath82 ( egedal , private communication ) .    finally , @xcite recently observed an active region reconnect with a nearby flux loop as it emerged from the corona .",
    "a phase of slow reconnection was observed for @xmath83 , during which magnetic energy accumulated in the corona .",
    "this was followed by fast reconnection lasting @xmath84 .",
    "the onset was sudden with no visible trigger mechanism observed .",
    "the energy released during fast reconnection was shown to be comparable to the energy accumulated during slow reconnection . based on parameters inferred from the observations ( a loop voltage of @xmath85 , a current sheet depth of @xmath86 , a sheet length of @xmath87 , a sheet current of @xmath88 , and a density of @xmath89 ) , the fast reconnection rate was @xmath90 , based on a reconnection electric field of @xmath91 and a reconnecting magnetic field of @xmath92 ,",
    "consistent with hall reconnection .",
    "these observations provide solid evidence for the accumulation of magnetic energy during a slow reconnection phase followed by a spontaneous onset of fast reconnection , as proposed here ."
