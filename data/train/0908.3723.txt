    "an important goal of exoplanet imaging is understanding how planetary systems form and this requires observing planets when they are very young , i.e. at ages less than a few million years .",
    "ten years after the first discovery of an extra - solar giant planet ( egp ) , the imaging era of exoplanet science has finally started .",
    "the year 2008 has been particularly prolific in that matter with the discovery of the first planetary system around the @xmath14 myr old hr 8799 @xcite , of the exoplanet candidates in orbit around the @xmath15 myr old fomalhaut @xcite , in orbit around the @xmath16 12 myr old @xmath17 pictoris @xcite , the potential companion to the @xmath18 myr old 1rxs j160929 - 210524 @xcite and the planetary mass object ( pmo ) candidate evolving round the 0.9 to 3 myr old t - tauri star ct cha @xcite .",
    "these new discoveries add to a few previous detections of planet candidates such as the pmo in orbit around the young ( @xmath16 10 myrs ) 25 @xmath19 brown dwarf ( bd ) 2m1207 @xcite and the companion in orbit around the @xmath16 @xmath20 myr old t tauri star gq lup @xcite .",
    "gq lup b is particularly interesting ; the co - moving companion is relatively bright ( k=13 ) and lies at 0.7 arcsec ( 100 @xmath21 50 au ) from the 7th magnitude k7ev primary . despite several studies , the mass of gq lup b is still poorly constrained .",
    "@xcite identified prominent co and @xmath22 bands typical of cool m9@xmath23l4 dwarfs but could not constrain accurately the mass of the companion ( @xmath24 ) because the effective temperature ( @xmath5 ; @xmath25 k ) , the gravity and the distance of the object were not well determined .",
    "@xcite have analyzed archived hst wfpc2 and nicmos data and subaru @xmath26 , @xmath3 , @xmath27 and l@xmath28 band images of gq lup b and provided estimates of its bolometric luminosity ( @xmath29 at 140 pc ) , its radius ( 0.38 @xmath21 0.05 @xmath30 ) and its effective temperature ( 2335 @xmath21 100 k ) . assuming a @xmath31 and based on the evolutionary models of @xcite , they inferred a mass ranging from 10 to 20 @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite secured @xmath2- and @xmath3-band spectra and found the companion to be somewhat hotter than previously reported with a spectral type between m6 and l0 corresponding to effective temperatures between 2400 and 2900 k assuming the effective temperature - spectral type relationship from @xcite . using the evolutionary models from @xcite and @xcite and their derived bolometric luminosity of @xmath32 they inferred a mass of @xmath33 .",
    "a mass estimate has also been reported by @xcite who acquired @xmath2- , @xmath3- and @xmath34-band spectra and compared them to the predictions of the gaia model from @xcite .",
    "the best fit resulted in @xmath35 and @xmath36 dex . from these values , their estimated @xmath37 and by comparison with 2m0535 @xcite which has a dynamically determined mass of @xmath38 @xmath19 and a similar age as gq lup , they derived a mass between 4 and 36 @xmath19 .",
    "a summary of previously reported physical parameters of gq lup b is given in table [ tab : gqlupcarac ] .    in light of the international astronomical union ( iau ) working definition which states that a planet must have a mass below the deuterium burning limit of @xmath39 @xmath19 , the nature of gq lup b thus remains uncertain .",
    "further progress will be made through a better distance estimation of the system and better spectroscopic characterization of the companion .    in this paper",
    ", we present new @xmath1 @xmath0 spectroscopic observations of the gq lup system taken with the integral field spectrograph nifs in combination with the adaptive optics system altair at the gemini north telescope using angular differential imaging ( adi ) to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the companion .",
    "the resulting spectrum is analyzed and compared with synthetic atmospheric spectra and evolutionary tracks to infer the physical parameters of the companion .",
    "the gq lup system was observed in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath34 bands respectively on the nights of 2007 may 30 , june 1 and june 27 at the gemini north telescope ( program gn-2007a - q-46 ) using nifs combined with the altair adaptive optics system @xcite .",
    "nifs is a near - infrared integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) based on the image slicer concept @xcite .",
    "it has a spectral resolving power of 5000 in each band , a total field of view of @xmath40 and rectangular spatial resolution elements of @xmath41 .",
    "all observations were obtained with the cassegrain rotator turned off to allow rotation of the field around the host star .",
    "the @xmath2- and @xmath3-band sequences consisted of @xmath42s and @xmath43s exposures , respectively , without any dithering .",
    "this allowed enough field rotation to use angular differential imaging ( adi ; @xcite ) to suppress the speckle noise .",
    "as the psf is better sampled and ao achieves better performance in the @xmath34 band , observations were obtained with a 9-position square dithering pattern with each position offsetted by @xmath44 ; in total 72 exposures of 50s were obtained .",
    "the median seeing was measured to be @xmath45 ,",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath34 respectively and the observations were conducted under a median air mass of 1.79 in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 and of 1.83 in @xmath34 . a spectroscopic standard for telluric correction was observed at five random dither positions having a maximal excursion of @xmath48 after the @xmath2-band sequence and both before and after the @xmath3 and @xmath34 bands observations .",
    "the spectroscopic standards for telluric correction were hip 82714 in @xmath2 and hip 69021 in both @xmath3 and @xmath34 .",
    "sky and arc lamp frames were taken at the end of each sequence .",
    "darks and flats as well as ronchi flats allowing the calibration of the spatial distortion of the camera were taken during daytime calibration .",
    "no astrometric calibration data ( plate scale and orientation ) were obtained .",
    "an observation log is shown in table [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the data cube reconstruction was done with the iraf gemini data reduction package version 1.9.1a .",
    "the calibration data were first processed to construct a flat field , a bad pixel map , a wavelength solution and a map of the curved spectral traces .",
    "the telluric data cubes were then reconstructed .",
    "the images were rectified to correct for the trace curvature and re - sampled to yield a common constant wavelength step for all spatial elements .",
    "a sky cube was built from the median of the dithered spectroscopic standard data and subtracted from each telluric cube .",
    "the latter were then corrected for atmospheric dispersion by fitting a gaussian kernel to the psf to find its center in each spectral slice and by translating the psfs to the center of the field - of - view .",
    "the median telluric spectrum was computed and divided by the spectrum of a blackbody at 10 000 k , the approximate a0v spectroscopic standard temperature .    the final step consisted in reducing the science data and building their associated data cubes . the sky frame obtained after the science observations was first subtracted from each image of the time - lapsed sequence .",
    "the science data cubes were extracted following the same procedure used for the telluric data .",
    "telluric correction was then applied .",
    "atmospheric dispersion was then corrected as before .",
    "interstellar extinction was considered to be negligible as most of the extinction associated with gq lup a is believed to be circumstellar @xcite .",
    "the rectangular ifs spatial resolution elements were interpolated to yield a spaxel size of @xmath49 in the final reconstructed cube .",
    "the term spaxel will be used to refer to a single @xmath50 element in the final data cube .",
    "this is applied to all ifs images to get a final dataset composed of time - lapsed data cubes .",
    "an example of a collapsed data cube , i.e. integrated over the full wavelength range of the photometric band , obtained for each observed band is shown in the top panels of figure [ fig : figcompallbands ] .",
    "a bright vertical stripe aligned with nifs slitlets is present in all our data .",
    "nifs is known to have some scattered light in each independent channel which can result in an enhanced sky proportional to the star brightness in each slitlet and could explain such a bright stripe .    in preparation for the extraction of the signal of gq lup b ,",
    "the bright signal from the primary psf was subtracted to first order by applying an unsharp mask with a gaussian kernel of six pixels fwhm , followed by the subtraction of a median radial intensity profile about the center of the psf .",
    "the images were then convolved by a 1 pixel fwhm gaussian kernel to attenuate the pixel - to - pixel noise resulting from the interpolation of the rectangular ifs spatial resolution elements to the square data cube spaxels .",
    "the resulting residual broad band images obtained after collapsing the data cubes are shown in the lower panels of figure [ fig : figcompallbands ] .",
    "note that the residual vertical stripe is subtracted by the adi speckle suppression algorithm ( see next section ) and does not impact the final @xmath2 and @xmath3 spectra . in the @xmath34 band , however , no such algorithm is used .",
    "we therefore only considered the first 45 data cubes obtained , in which the companion does not overlap with the vertical stripe .",
    "the @xmath34 band spectrum was extracted from these residual images by summing the flux in a 2 spaxel diameter circular aperture .      as can be seen in figure [ fig : figcompallbands ] ,",
    "the residual speckle noise is significant at the separation of the companion and this severely limits the accuracy by which the spectrum can be extracted . in principle , this speckle noise could be attenuated using spectral deconvolution techniques @xcite but , in practice , the companion radial displacement is only @xmath51 nifs spaxels in a data cube rescaled such that the speckles at different wavelengths overlap .",
    "this , combined with the companion brightness , makes an accurate fit of the speckle pattern contaminating the companion spectrum very hard to obtain .",
    "the approach chosen instead was to use the adi technique developed by @xcite .",
    "this technique consists in acquiring a series of images with the cassegrain rotator of an alt - az telescope turned off .",
    "this allows field rotation between each observation of the sequence . the companion is then rotating around its host star in the time - lapse sequence while the quasi - static speckles introduced by the defects of the telescope optical elements stay fixed . for each data cube of the time series",
    ", a reference data cube can be built from the other data cubes , and used to subtract the speckle pattern and attenuate the speckle noise .",
    "examples of images obtained after the subtraction of their median radial profile taken at intervals of 65 minutes in the @xmath3 band are shown in figure [ fig : figadirot ] .",
    "this corresponds to an image at the beginning , the middle and the end of the whole sequence .",
    "the long speckle life time is clearly seen in that sequence while the companion revolves around its host star due to field rotation .",
    "the reference data cube was built using the `` locally optimized combination of images '' ( loci ) algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "this algorithm builds a reference psf having the highest speckle correlation with respect to the analyzed frame from the dataset composed of the time sequence of images .",
    "this is done by first dividing the frame in optimization subsections .",
    "the reference psf is then built for each zone by computing the linear combination of images that guarantees the lowest possible residual noise after subtraction .",
    "only the images of the time sequence in which the companion had a sufficient displacement compared to the analyzed frame are used to build the reference psf to avoid a significant companion flux loss .",
    "the resulting minimal time separation between two frames is the one yielding the best companion s / n when two frames are differentiated .",
    "this was found to be 2400s in @xmath2 and 2700s in the @xmath3 band which respectively corresponds to 6 and 9 images in the time sequence and to a minimal companion displacement of 2.7 and 2.9 pixels .",
    "since the companion position is already known , a single horseshoe shaped optimization zone centered on the host star and having a mean radius corresponding to that of the companion was used .",
    "the radial width is taken to be 4 pixels .",
    "the missing azimuthal zone is the one in which the companion is moving through the time sequence .",
    "this algorithm is applied to each spectral slice of each data cube .",
    "the resulting data cubes are then rotated to align the field of view and summed to build the final adi data cube .",
    "the companion spectrum was extracted from this final cube by summing the flux in a 2 spaxel diameter circular aperture .    applying this adi process to each data cube",
    "has the advantage of increasing the s / n of the companion spectrum by significantly attenuating the speckle noise .",
    "however , a fraction of the companion signal is lost through the application of the loci algorithm @xcite . moreover",
    ", the fact that each spectral slice is treated independently from the others can have an impact on the resulting spectral shape .",
    "hence , we have developed an algorithm to determine the influence of adi on the companion spectrum .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider only a single slice of a given data cube in the sequence , keeping in mind that the procedure described below is repeated for each slice and each cube .",
    "following the execution of the above loci subtraction algorithm , the residual integrated flux at the companion position in the cube considered can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the integrated flux in the slice considered before loci subtraction , @xmath54 is the same but for cube @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the set of coefficients found by the loci algorithm .",
    "the integrated flux @xmath53 can be expressed as the sum of a signal @xmath57 coming from the companion and a signal @xmath58 coming from quasi - static speckles , yielding @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the residual speckle signal , which on average will be close to zero .",
    "our goal is to find the true companion signal @xmath57 , and so we must estimate the quantity @xmath61 , i.e. the fraction of the companion signal that was subtracted by the algorithm .",
    "this was done by introducing a fake companion of known flux and flat spectrum into the images , at the same separation as gq lup b but 180  from it .",
    "the fake companion was taken to be a shifted and intensity scaled - down version of the primary star ; its psf should thus be very similar to that of gq lup b. the loci algorithm was applied to the sequence of data with the fake companion by using the exact same coefficients as for the data without the fake companion . then the fake companion residual flux @xmath62 was retrieved .",
    "since the true fake companion signal @xmath63 and the residual speckle signal @xmath64 at the location of the fake companion are known ( the latter from the execution of the algorithm without the fake companion ) , the fraction of the fake companion flux that was subtracted by the algorithm in a given spectral slice can be readily computed as @xmath65 this fraction should be the same for gq lup b as for the fake companion since the same coefficients were used for both and they have the same psf .",
    "note also that @xmath66 is independent of the fake companion azimuthal position as @xmath67 only depends on the relative angular position of the companion psf between the analyzed frame and the cube @xmath55 .",
    "so , the true signal of gq lup b can be calculated as @xmath68 where in practice @xmath69 is neglected ; the resulting error on @xmath57 is computed by measuring the residual speckle noise at the companion radius .",
    "the correction factors @xmath66 computed for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 adi spectra by the above procedure are shown in figure  [ fig : graphspeccorrection ] .",
    "finally , to make sure that the above procedure did not introduce any artificial feature in the spectra , mainly in their continuum shape , we have performed a simple spectrum extraction directly from the reduced data cubes without any adi processing .",
    "the resulting spectra were compared with the spectra obtained with adi processing and no significant difference was found , save for a lower s / n . more precisely , a similar procedure as for the @xmath34 band data was used to extract a non - adi spectrum from the data cubes in which the companion is the least affected by the vertical stripe in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "the resulting adi spectrum was then divided by the non - adi one to characterize the continuum dispersion .",
    "the median non - adi @xmath2 band spectrum of the first six data cubes had only a 5% continuum difference with the adi spectrum .",
    "similarly , the first eight and last four data cubes in the @xmath3-band were used to compute the median non - adi spectrum and the resulting continuum had only a 6% slope difference with the adi spectrum .",
    "the ability of the algorithms described in the previous section to attenuate the speckle noise in nifs data is evaluated in this section .",
    "the speckle noise attenuation factor is defined as the ratio of the noise in the initial image over the noise in an adi image .",
    "the noise in adi images was corrected for the companion flux loss during the adi process using fake companion implants .",
    "each spectral slice was evaluated independently .",
    "we report the median value of speckle noise attenuation in all the spectral slices as a function of angular separation from gq lup .",
    "the noise was evaluated by computing the standard deviation of spaxels within an annulus of one spaxel width at each radius .",
    "gq lup b was masked out from the images .",
    "the results are plotted at the top of figure [ fig : specnoiseattadi ] for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands while the contrast curves achieved are plotted at the bottom of the figure . for a single data cube ,",
    "the adi subtraction provided a noise attenuation by a factor of 1.5 to 2 in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while the combination of all adi data cubes after alignment of their field of view provided an additional noise attenuation by a factor of 2 to 3 .",
    "overall , the speckle noise is attenuated by a factor of @xmath70 in @xmath2 and a factor @xmath71 in @xmath3 .",
    "the relative photometry of the companion compared with its host star is first evaluated .",
    "unfortunately , the peak of gq lup a is saturated or in the detector non - linear regime over most of the @xmath2 band and the entire @xmath3 band , preventing us from calculating differential photometry over those bands . in @xmath2 , over the narrow spectral range in which gq lup a is in the detector linear regime ( @xmath72 ) , we calculated a contrast of @xmath73 mag for the companion .",
    "the uncertainty was measured by computing the standard deviation of the flux in 20 apertures identical to the one used to integrate the companion flux at the same radius as the companion .",
    "the peak of gq lup a is below non - linearity in the entire @xmath34 band ; we measured a differential photometry of @xmath74 mag .",
    "gq lup a is a known variable classical t tauri star ( e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite reported it to vary by @xmath75 mag and @xmath76 mag in @xmath2 and @xmath27 bands respectively over a period of @xmath77 days while @xcite found it to vary by a maximal amplitude of @xmath78 mag in the @xmath27 band between may 2005 and feb 2007 . using the gq lup a photometry reported by @xcite of @xmath79 mag and the @xmath2-band photometry from 2mass @xmath80 with the updated error bar from @xcite , we find a gq lup b photometry of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath27 value is consistent with @xmath83 from @xcite and the @xmath2-band value is consistent with @xmath84 reported by @xcite .",
    "our spectra of gq lup b are shown in fig .",
    "the s / n are 145 , 76 and 15 at @xmath85 in @xmath0 respectively where the noise was computed from the dispersion of the flux measured in 20 apertures situated at the same radius as the companion .",
    "the integrated flux in each aperture were corrected by @xmath86 ( see section [ sec : adi ] ) .    in the same figure ,",
    "our @xmath0 spectrum of gq lup b is compared with the previously published results obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first noted feature is that our spectra are redder than the ones reported by @xcite in all three bands while they have a similar continuum slope as the ones reported by @xcite .",
    "dividing our spectra by the ones reported by @xcite reveals differences in the overall spectral slopes of 22% , 48% and 15% respectively in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath34 .",
    "this difference is of 8% in @xmath2 and of 17% in @xmath3 when compared to @xcite where most of the @xmath3-band difference lies in the bluer spectral range with a 14% continuum difference below @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "the difference between the two spectra at the redder end is then of only @xmath89 .",
    "a second difference is seen for the @xmath13 emission line , which is weaker by about an order of magnitude in our spectrum compared to that of @xcite .",
    "while it is detected with an equivalent width of ew(@xmath90 = @xmath91 by these authors , it is detected with an ew@xmath92 = @xmath93 in ours .",
    "emission - lines of pms accreting objects are known to vary either due to accretion variability , to projection effects on the accreting column rotating around the object or to hot spots that are not always visible to the observer due to the object rotation ( see @xcite and reference therein for more details ) .",
    "the strongest @xmath94 variations found in the literature were reported by @xcite who analyzed a sample of 14 bds also observed by @xcite one to two years later .",
    "they found a variation of a factor of two at most for all the objects in their sample except for one that varied by a factor of three .",
    "this makes gq lup b significantly more variable than any other bd previously observed .",
    "this fact along with the continuum differences raise the possibility that gq lup b spectra from @xcite are contaminated by some host star flux .",
    "indeed , such a contamination could explain both the bluer continuum and the significantly stronger @xmath13 emission line measured by @xcite since the spectrum of a is bluer than b and exhibits strong @xmath13 emission .",
    "however , the similarities between the ki doublets ew reported in table [ tab : ewcomp ] for both spectra argues against this .",
    "the use of psf subtraction algorithms could potentially introduce artefacts in the companion spectrum .",
    "the fact that different algorithms were used in the three compared papers could then explain the discrepancy between their spectra .",
    "as discussed before , we do not believe that artefacts were introduced by our adi subtraction procedure given the small difference ( respectively , 5 and 6% for the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 band ) between the median non - adi and adi spectra .",
    "this assertion is reinforced by the presence of the same discrepancy between our results and the ones from @xcite in the @xmath34 band where no adi processing was done .",
    "at this point , we do not have any satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy between the results of the different papers .",
    "in figure [ fig : graphspeccomp ] , our spectra are compared with the @xmath18 myr late - m to early - l dwarfs usco j160830 - 233511 , usco j161302 - 212428 and usco j163919 - 253409 from @xcite , the @xmath95 myr 2mass j014158 - 463357 @xcite and some older field dwarfs taken from the nirspec brown dwarf spectroscopic survey ( bdss ) @xcitemclean / bdssarchive/ ] and from @xcitespex / spexlibrary / irtflibrary.html ] .",
    "a first feature that is seen by comparing gq lup b with the field dwarfs is that the absorption from @xmath22 at 1.34 @xmath88 , known as being mostly temperature dependent in low - mass objects ( e.g. @xcite ) , is similar to objects of spectral types between l0 and l2 .",
    "this is also supported by the comparison of the continuum slope shortward of @xmath96 @xmath88 and longward of @xmath97 , while the region in between has been reported as being particularly affected by the reduced @xmath98 collisionally - induced absorption ( cia ) in young , low gravity objects such as gq lup b @xcite .",
    "this also explains the better agreement in that zone with the younger objects .",
    "@xmath98 cia has its strongest effect in the @xmath34 band where gq lup b does not exhibit the decrease in flux seen between 2.15 and 2.30 @xmath88 in field objects and has significantly shallower co absorption .",
    "the @xmath34-band spectrum is better reproduced by the young objects , with the l1 spectra being the most similar .",
    "hence , we find a spectral type of l1@xmath99 for this object .",
    "this is at the cooler end of the m6-l0 spectral type reported by @xcite and is consistent with the m9-l4 spectral type inferred by @xcite .",
    "this is verified by computing the @xmath22 index at 1.5 @xmath88 defined by @xcite , which is believed to be independent of surface gravity .",
    "we find a spectral type of l0 @xmath99 also consistent with our spectral type estimate .",
    "the @xmath5 - spectral type relationship of @xcite implies @xmath100 .",
    "however , this relation was only calibrated for evolved field objects and thus should be used with caution with young objects .",
    "@xcite also demonstrate that objects of a similar optically determined spectral type exhibit a significant dispersion in their near - ir relative color .",
    "this illustrates the challenge of using such a relation to infer @xmath5 , especially from near - ir data .",
    "one can also estimate the effective temperature of gq lup b and its gravity by comparing our @xmath0 spectra with synthetic ones generated by the gaia model v.2.6.1 @xcite .",
    "the grid explored includes r=5000 spectra ranging from @xmath5 = 2000 to 2900 k and from @xmath101 1.5 to 5.5 dex with increments of 100 k and 0.5 dex respectively .",
    "a @xmath102 minimization algorithm was used to find the best fitting parameters . as reported by @xcite ,",
    "current atmosphere models poorly reproduce the strong @xmath22 absorptions between 1.32 and 1.60 @xmath88 and between 1.75 and 2.20 @xmath88 .",
    "hence , the @xmath3 band was not used in the fit and those zones were masked out of the @xmath2- and @xmath34-band spectra .",
    "the @xmath13 emission line in the @xmath2 band was also masked out of the fit .",
    "the @xmath34-band fit is poor and leads to an optimal @xmath5 @xmath103 2900 k which is largely inconsistent with any previous @xmath5 estimates for this object .",
    "however , our @xmath34-band spectrum is very similar to other young brown dwarfs of similar spectral types in the zone fitted as seen in figure [ fig : graphspeccomp ] .",
    "this indicates that there is still some discrepancy between models and young low - gravity objects in that band .",
    "hence , only the @xmath2-band spectrum was used to estimate @xmath5 and @xmath104 .",
    "good fits were obtained for @xmath5 = @xmath105 k and @xmath104 = @xmath106 with a best fit value of @xmath5 = 2400 k and @xmath107 .",
    "the model and observed spectra are compared in figure [ fig : gaiafitspec ] for the @xmath2 band .",
    "the observed @xmath3- and @xmath34-band spectra as well as the synthetic ones obtained for those best fitting values are shown in figure [ fig : gaiafithk ] .",
    "hence , we adopt @xmath5 = @xmath6 k and @xmath108 dex . the same exercise was repeated with grids of ames - dusty and ames - cond synthetic spectra and all converged to the same solution .    from these results ,",
    "the mass of gq lup b is evaluated following the procedure used in @xcite .",
    "the model spectra flux is first adjusted to best fit the photometric data points reported in this work and in the literature through a @xmath102 minimization algorithm .",
    "the resulting spectra along with the photometric measurements used for the fit are plotted in figure [ fig : compmag ] .",
    "the luminosity is then evaluated to be equal to @xmath109 dex by integrating the model flux over the whole wavelength range and by using the companion distance estimate from @xcite of @xmath110 pc . adopting the @xcite age estimate of @xmath20 myr for the companion and plotting the new luminosity on the dusty evolutionary tracks from @xcite yields a mass estimate between @xmath111 ( see figure [ fig : dustylum ] ) putting gq lup b most likely in the brown dwarf regime .",
    "even though evolutionary models are uncertain at the young age of gq lup @xcite , @xcite provide a first anchor point with the @xmath112 myr eclipsing binary 2m0535 - 05 .",
    "the lower mass object of this system ( @xmath38 @xmath19 ) is particularly interesting as it has a mass comparable to the one estimated for gq lup b. the comparison of its dynamically measured mass with the prediction of the evolutionary model gives an estimate of the model systematic error .",
    "@xcite evolutionary tracks predict a luminosity of @xmath113 for an object with such a mass and then underestimate it by a factor of @xmath114 . even though this lies only at @xmath115 of its measured luminosity and , hence , does not constitute a convincing evidence of a model systematic error , it is still interesting to include this error in our analysis to take into account the model uncertainty .",
    "updating our mass estimate with this systematic error leads to a revised lower mass value of @xmath116 which is below the boundary between a planetary mass object and a brown dwarf .",
