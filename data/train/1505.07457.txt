    "<S> in other words , by increasing the separable correlations above a ` reactivation threshold ' we can retrieve the otherwise lost quadripartite entanglement ( it is in this sense that we talk of ` reactivated ' entanglement below ) . the measurement of the relay </S>",
    "<S> can then localize this multipartite entanglement into a bipartite form , shared by the two remote parties and exploitable for the various protocols .    as a matter of fact , we find that all the quantum protocols can be reactivated . in particular , their reactivation occurs in a progressive fashion , so that increasing the environmental correlations first reactivates entanglement swapping and teleportation , then entanglement distillation and finally qkd . our theory is confirmed by a proof - of - principle experiment which shows the reactivation of the most nested protocol , i.e. , the qkd  protocol . </S>"
