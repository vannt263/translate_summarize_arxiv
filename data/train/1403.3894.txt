    "a _ barrier _ or an _ opaque set _ for @xmath3 is a set @xmath4 that intersects every line that intersects @xmath0 . for example , when @xmath0 is a square , any of the four sets depicted in figure  [ figure : barriers_square ] is a barrier .     and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the third barrier consists of two sides and half of a diagonal , and has length @xmath6 .",

    "note that some part of the barrier may lie outside @xmath0        ( figure  [ figure : barriers_disk ] ) , and the barrier need not be connected .",
    "this notion dates back at least to mazurkiewicz s work in 1916  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in `` short '' barriers  @xmath8 for a given object  @xmath0 , and hence we restrict attention to _ rectifiable",

    "we mean that @xmath8 is a union of countably many curves  @xmath9 , pairwise disjoint except at the endpoints , that each have finite length @xmath10 , and the sum of these lengths converges .",
    "we call this sum the _ length _ of @xmath8 and denote it by @xmath11 .    finding the shortest barrier is hard , even for simple shapes  @xmath0 , such as the square , the equilateral triangle , and the disk  @xcite .",

    "the best known lower bound for the unit square has been @xmath2 , established by jones in 1964  @xcite . in general , for convex @xmath0 , a barrier needs to have length at least half the perimeter of @xmath0 ( we review a proof in section  [ section : jones lower bound ] ) :    [ lemma : jones lower bound ] @xmath13 for any rectifiable barrier @xmath8 of a convex set @xmath3 with perimeter @xmath14 .",
    "thus , from the point of view of finding short barriers , the trivial strategy of enclosing the entire perimeter ( or the perimeter of the convex hull if @xmath0 is a non - convex connected set ) gives a @xmath2-approximation .",
    "see @xcite and references therein for algorithms that find shorter barriers .",
    "the current best approximation ratio is @xmath15  @xcite .    proving a",
    "better lower bound has been elusive ( again , even for specific shapes @xmath0 ) .",
    "there has been some partial progress under additional assumptions about the shape ( single arc , connected , etc . ) and location ( inside @xmath0 , near @xmath0 , etc . ) of the barrier  @xcite , but establishing an unconditional lower bound strictly greater than @xmath2 for the unit square has been open ( see ( * ? ? ? * open problem",
    "5 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote 1 ) ) .",
    "we prove such a lower bound in section  [ section : main ] :    [ theorem : square ] @xmath16 for any rectifiable barrier  @xmath8 of the unit square  @xmath17 .",
    "dumitrescu and jiang @xcite recently obtained a lower bound of @xmath18 under the assumption that the barrier lies in the square obtained by magnifying @xmath17 by @xmath2 about its centre .",
    "their proof , conceived independently of ours and at about the same time , is based on quite different ideas , most notably the line - sweeping technique .",
    "it will be worth exploring whether their techniques can be combined with ours .",
    "our proof can be generalized ( section  [ section : general convex ] ) :    [ theorem : general convex ] for any closed convex set @xmath0 with perimeter  @xmath14 that is not a triangle , there is @xmath19 such that any barrier  @xmath8 for @xmath0 has length at least @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the only convex objects for which we fail to establish a lower bound better than lemma  [ lemma : jones lower bound ] are triangles .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ section : jones lower bound ] , we present jones proof for lemma  [ lemma : jones lower bound ] .",
    "we also prove that instead of rectifiable barriers , it is sufficient to restrict our attention to barriers comprised of line segments . in section",
    "[ section : lemmas ] , we present three preliminary lemmas , analyzing some important special cases in which we can expect to improve on jones bound .",
    "the proof of one of these lemmas is postponed to section  [ section : proof of lemmas ] .",
    "the three preliminary lemmas are combined in section  [ section : main ] to obtain our lower bound for the length of a barrier for the square ( theorem  [ theorem : square ] ) . in section  [ section : general convex ] , we show how to generalize these arguments to other convex sets ( theorem  [ theorem : general convex ] ) . in the last section , we discuss a closely related question .",

    "note that theorems [ theorem : square ] and [ theorem : general convex ] do not merely state the non - existence of a straight barrier  @xmath8 of length exactly half the perimeter of @xmath0 .",
