    "the detection of gravitational waves is a critical test of einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "we have at present good indirect evidence for the existence of such waves in the orbital decays of binary pulsars  @xcite , but no direct evidence .",
    "unfortunately , we expect most astrophysical sources to be so distant that the waves should be very weak by the time they reach the solar system , making terrestrial detection a challenge .",
    "it is natural to ask whether gravitational waves might have effects on matter or light closer to the sources , where the waves are stronger , but with the effects being observable on the earth . in particular",
    ", one might search for modulations in light caused by its passage through gravitational waves , for instance light from another electromagnetic source passing nearby a neutron star or binary system .",
    "( here and throughout , ` light ' means electromagnetic signals of any frequency which can be treated by geometric optics . ) these modulations could include variations in intensity , in apparent position , in polarisation , in phase , or in time - dilation ( often referred to in the literature as time - delay ) .",
    "of course , such variations could also be produced by other means ; one would need further information to conclude they were caused by gravitational waves .",
    "such possibilities were contemplated by a number of authors , notably @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; it seemed from these papers that some of the effects might be detectable in the near future .",
    "concerns , though , were raised about the adequacy of those treatments , and @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , after more considered analyses , found very much smaller effects than then the optimistic ones in the earlier papers .",
    "the effects were so small that they seemed to preclude the detection of gravitational waves by these means , at least for known classes of systems in the near future .",
    "this conclusion has been accepted by much of the community @xcite .",
    "but the situation is not so clear - cut .",
    "for one thing , the later authors investigations , while overlapping the earlier ones , do not cover all of the physical possibilities they considered . also the results as they stand strongly suggest there are essential points which have not yet been understood .",
    "we can appreciate this if we ask how such gross discrepancies between the earlier and later work could have occurred .",
    "while it is true that much of the earlier work involved rough approximations , one would think that in order to explain such a large and systematic change there must have been a shift in what was taken to be the essential physics .",
    "the earlier papers typically and very plausibly found that the light rays responded to the gravitational radiation fields of the sources , but later authors found that there were cancellations which resulted in those terms not entering .",
    "indeed , damour and esposito - farse pointed out that pure , vacuum , gravitational waves would give _ no _ overall scattering in linearized theory .",
    "more specifically , both damour and esposito - farse , and kopeikin et al . , reported that what scattering of a light - ray by an isolated source ( on a straight world - line in linearised theory ) does occur depends only on the source s configuration at the light - ray s point of closest approach .",
    "this is something which can not be locally causally determined , and therefore must depend on a non - local cancellation of effects over the light - ray s trajectory .",
    "these observations suggest that the cancellations are tied to the infinite extent of the light - ray s trajectory , and may not occur for propagation along finite , or only half - infinite , segments .",
    "we shall see below that this is indeed the case .",
    "in other words , the cancellations are present when the light effectively comes in from infinity , but larger effects are possible when the emission is from a finite point , in particular when it might be close to the gravitational - wave source .",
    "such situations are very much of interest , because there are many astrophysical configurations in which there is a source of light near an expected source of gravitational radiation .",
    "this fits well with other points in the literature .",
    "one can see that many of the earlier works did , either explicitly or in effect , use scattering estimates which depended on integration over half - infinite or finite segments rather than doubly - infinite lines , and in some cases ( depending on the situation considered ) the authors were correct in wanting to do so . and damour and esposito - farse ( see also @xcite ) correctly noted that overcoming the cancellations would depend on ` edge effects ' .",
    "the paper of kopeikin et al .",
    "is sometimes considered to show that no significantly larger effects arise from finite or half - infinite segments .",
    "this , however , is not really correct . while these authors did indeed work out formulas for the null geodesics around certain sources in linearised gravity ,",
    "those formulas are very lengthy and were examined in detail only in certain limiting cases .",
    "none of those cases corresponds to the configuration of ultimate interest here , a light - emission reasonably close to the gravitational - wave source ( precisely , within of the order of the impact parameter to the light - ray s point of closest approach to the gravity - wave source ) received by a distant observer .",
    "in fact , the computations of kopeikin et al .",
    "are consistent with the possibility of larger effects from restricted segments .",
    "there is , additionally , a key issue which must be properly addressed if we are to take into account the emission ( or reception ) of light - rays at finite events , especially events near gravitationally radiating sources .",
    "we do not expect to learn anything about gravitational radiation from the reception of one light - ray ; rather , it is in the changes in the light received over time that the we hope the information is encoded .",
    "in other words , it is _ differential _ scattering effects , of successive light - rays _ relative _ to each other , which are of interest . but to treat these properly , we must know we are modelling the emissions of the successive rays accurately .",
    "this is potentially problematic when the light - sources themselves are in the region affected by the gravitational waves , because the effects of the waves on the light through their perturbations of the motion of the light - sources compete with the other contributions .    another way of saying this is that the received signal depends , not only on the gravitational field through which the light has passed , but also on the apparent acceleration of the light - emitter , as inferred from electromagnetic measurements at the receiver .",
    "even if the emitter suffers no _ local _ acceleration , its trajectory as reconstructed from light - signals coming into the detector will appear to involve accelerations , because of the gravitational radiation the light has passed through .",
    "( and so one might want to say that the variations in the received signal are not purely due to scattering , but also to this non - local acceleration of the source . however , from a general - relativistic point of view these are two facets of the same thing . )",
    "this is a point which has only been partially attended to in the literature on scattering . in certain restricted cases , where the gravitational waves have a simple form and the light - rays considered",
    "are aligned to take advantage of it , the issue has been considered ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but the pattern has been to compute the null geodesics but not examine all the details of the time - dependence of light - emission and reception .    for instance , @xcite worked out the null geodesics around certain gravitational sources in linearised theory , in terms of the geodesics initial positions and tangents .",
    "they derived formulas for the coordinates of finite points along the geodesics , but they did not fully resolve the question of how to choose the data for a one - parameter family of null geodesics emitted at one world - line and received at another .",
    "( they addressed some aspects of the issue , with their discussion of the appropriateness of their gauge choice .",
    "that argument shows that some light - emitters may be modelled by taking the spatial coordinates , in the gauge used , fixed .",
    "for such an emitter , the initial positions of the null geodesics would simply be the points on the emitter s world - line .",
    "however , this leaves open the question of how to choose the geodesics tangents , so as to ensure the geodesics go from the emitter to the receiver ; it also leaves open the question of how to treat generic emitters , which need not have their space coordinates constant . ) developments of this approach can of course take into such variations ; see @xcite .",
    "we wish then to extend the existing treatment of light - scattering by gravitational fields to propagation over finite or half - infinite segments , accounting for the gravitational waves effects on the light - sources in those cases .",
    "it is worthwhile considering what the best approach is .",
    "virtually all work that has been done in this area has been done in the linearised - gravity ( or at least linearised gravitational - wave ) setting , and has used detailed coordinate calculations in specific gauges .",
    "there are reasons for wanting a more general , and invariant , approach .",
    "most importantly , the core issue  how light emitted from successive events along one world - line is received along another , after passage through a region of space  time  is evidently a basic problem in relativity : it is worth treating in generality .",
    "it is a tenet of relativity that the physics is invariant , so invariant treatments focus most directly on the physics ; a central goal of this paper is to give one .",
    "as emphasized earlier , the key physical observables are associated with _ differential _",
    "scattering , of successive light - rays relative to each other .",
    "this is governed by the geodesic deviation equation , a linear ordinary differential equation involving the curvature , and it is the solution of this equation which is the central mathematical chore in an invariant approach .",
    "by contrast , gauge - based approaches focus on the metric and on integrating the null geodesics , a considerable task .",
    "it is only once these are known that one can proceed to extract the measurable differential effects ( and , as noted above , this further step has not generally been completely worked out in these approaches ) .",
    "one sees that the invariant approach goes more directly to the observables .",
    "also , by limiting oneself to differential effects , one expands considerably the cases which can be treated , since one need not confront the problem of finding the null geodesics explicitly .",
    "the invariant formulas derived here would , for instance , be applicable in a cosmological context , or to treat light - rays in strong gravitational fields .    with the invariant formulas in hand",
    ", one can always specialise to gauge choices which may be convenient for particular problems .",
    "but not having to make such a choice too early saves much work , and does away with many conceptual issues associated with gauges .    in some of the literature the motivation for",
    "the choice of gauge is to be confident that one is indeed modelling gravitational waves , as opposed to other gravitational disturbances . in this paper , that is a distinction which is best made , not at the beginning of the analysis , but rather once we have the general formulas .",
    "this is because there is no very simple invariant characterization of what counts as gravitational radiation and what does not .",
    "we first derive general , invariant , formulas ; we may then specialise these to systems which are gravitationally radiating .",
    "the aims and results of this paper are :    \\(a ) to provide an invariant treatment of the effects of gravity on light , in the approximation where the electromagnetic field can be treated by geometric optics , in exact general relativity , and a specialisation of that treatment to linearised gravity .",
    "in particular , while much of the motivation for this work comes from wanting to understand gravitational waves , the approach here allows us to treat any gravitational fields in general relativity .",
    "i emphasized above that the effects of interest were all differential ones , where one light - ray is compared with a nearby one .",
    "thus the main tool in the analysis is the geodesic deviation equation .",
    "essentially , the task is to solve this equation with initial and final conditions corresponding to the emission of light at one world - line and its absorption at another .",
    "this approach allows us to disregard many of the coordinate issues which occur elsewhere .",
    "for instance , previous papers have tended to discuss ` time - delay ' effects in terms of local coordinate times , whereas it is really the clock times of the emitter and the receiver of light which are relevant ; the approach here gives an integro - differential equation directly relating the clock times .",
    "there are similar equations for the changes observed at the receiver in the wave - vector ( this is equivalent to equations for the change in phase , since the wave - vector is the gradient of the phase ) and the electromagnetic field ( and thus the amplitudes and polarisations ) . in all of these cases ,",
    "the changes are determined partly by the geometry of the space  time the light propagates through , partly by the world - lines of the emitter and receiver , and partly by any intrinsic changes in the field at the emitter .",
    "all of these contributions are accounted for directly .",
    "these results are closely related to those of damour and esposito - farse ; the chief difference is that they worked with the field s fourier transform and gave global results , whereas our analysis is directly in terms of the radiative data and considers not only the limiting case of a doubly - infinite geodesic , but how that limit arises .",
    "similarly , the results here are also compatible with the computations of kopeikin et al .",
    "\\(b ) to give rough estimates of the effects in question in the case of quadrupolar radiation in linearised gravity .    of the various effects on the propagation of light by its passage through , or emission in , a gravitational wave field ",
    "changes in its position on the celestial sphere of the receiver , in its phase , polarisation , amplitude , or time - dilation ",
    "the last is , at present , the least difficult to imagine measuring .",
    "we shall find that changes in the position on the celestial sphere and phase are suppressed by a geometric factor ( related to the ` lighthouse effect ' ) . while changes in polarisation or ( fractional ) amplitude might be , in numerical terms , of the same magnitudes as those due to time - dilation",
    ", it is hard to foresee polarisation or intensity measurements accurate enough to reveal gravitational - wave effects .    the time - dilation effects ( often referred to as ` time - delay effects ' ) arise from the distortion @xmath1 of the light - emitter s proper time @xmath2 as measured by light - signals arriving at the receiver s proper time @xmath3 .",
    "this function @xmath1 depends on gravitational radiation the light encounters ; in particular , we shall see that an integral of a curvature component over the geodesic contributes to @xmath4 .",
    "one result of this is a red - shift ; also , if the emitter can be expected to give off signals at known proper times ( for instance , if it is a pulsar ) , then the light s passage through a gravitational wave may cause the times of arrival of those signals to wander slightly from what they would have been , had no radiation been present .    the detection of these effects would require training a telescope , whether optical or radio , on a light - emitter in the vicinity of a gravitational - wave source .",
    "for this reason we are interested primarily in sources which have at least a reasonable likelihood of radiating in a reasonable observing period",
    ". these will be continuous , localised , sources of gravitational waves , which unfortunately are thought to be weak .",
    "the best sort of candidate found here would involve a tight binary as the source of gravitational waves , with a nearby pulsar ( perhaps as a distant tertiary ) as the light - emitter . for two @xmath5 stars ( or black holes ) in a @xmath6-day circular orbit , i find possible displacements @xmath7 in pulse arrival times @xmath8 . for ( as might possibly be found in a globular cluster ) a one - solar - mass star in a one - day circular orbit around a @xmath9 black hole , one has @xmath10 . for ( as might happen near the galactic centre ) a star of mass @xmath11 in a ten - year circular orbit around a @xmath12 black - hole , one has @xmath13 .",
    "these displacements would vary with a period half the orbital period .",
    "the next section develops a general formalism for the analysis , valid in full general relativity , based on geodesic deviation . in section 3 , this is specialised to the case of linearised gravity ; there the geodesic deviation equation can be solved in terms of curvature integrals .",
    "section 4 considers the effects of quadrupole sources ( allowing both ` electric ' and ` magnetic ' terms ) of gravitational radiation on light - rays in the sources wave zones . in section 5 ,",
    "those results are applied to estimate the magnitudes of the effects for some expected sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "section 6 contains a summary and discussion .    the reader wishing to skip the derivations",
    "will find the formula ( [ ttimeqtheta ] ) for the comparison of emitter and receiver clock - times at the end of section 4 ; the meanings of the symbols in this formula are recapitulated in the paragraph containing it .",
    "the rough estimate of the magnitude of the effect is ( [ rough ] ) .",

    "( [ rough ] ) .    finally , two remarks about the angular dependence of the effects through the factor in curly braces in eq .",
    "( [ ttimeqtheta ] ) .",
    "first , the variations of this term for moderate @xmath215 means that different light - emitters in this regime will probe the different components of the quadrupole tensors .",
    "second , one might have thought that , for light - sources further away , the trigonometric factors would tend to suppress the dependences on @xmath207 , the vector from the origin to the point of closest approach , and lead to a dependence of the effects primarily on @xmath208 , the tangent to the light - ray .",
    "the opposite is true of the factor in curly braces in eq .",
    "( [ ttimeqtheta ] ) , however .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the transversality of the waves ; the components of the curvature that enter are orthogonal to the position - vector relative to the origin .",
    "of the various possible modulations of the light by its passage through , and emission within , the gravitational radiation  changes in the received light s amplitude , polarisation , phase , location on the receiver s sky , and time - dilation ",
    "it seems that in most cases time - dilation will be the most promising for detection ( but still , as we shall see , quite challenging ) . as pointed out earlier , changes in the location and phase will be suppressed by a geometric factor .",
    "changes in amplitude and polarisation would be so small they would probably be too hard to detect .    in this section",
    "i shall estimate two time - dilation effects , red - shift and pulse time - of - arrival offsets , in some cases of interest .",
    "first some rough general formulas for these will be derived ; we will see that they are expressed naturally in terms of a dimensionless intrinsic measure of gravitational - wave strength , the _ bondi news _",
    "( essentially @xmath274 in our case ) .",
    "while this quantity is central in much of gravitational radiation theory , few numerical values for it have appeared in the astrophysical literature , so samples of these are given .",
    "i then discuss the pulsar timing resolutions appropriate to the detection of time - of - arrival wanderings ( unfortunately , the extraordinary long - term stability of pulsars does not help directly with this ) , and finally estimate those wanderings .",
    "the entire light - signal from the emitter is subject to a time - dilation , which will itself be a function of time",
    ". if the emitted signal is @xmath275 in the frame of the emitter , then , the received signal will be ( neglecting other effects ) @xmath276 ; that is , there will be a distortion due to the relative differences in the flows of time .",
    "one effect this would give rise to would be a time - dependent red - shift .",
    "or if one knew the light - source was , in its own frame , emitting regular signals ( for instance , if it were a pulsar ) , the effect of the gravitational radiation would be to make the times of receipt of these wander slightly from complete regularity .    where linearised gravity is adequate , the equation governing this was ( [ timeq ] ) , and it contained three sorts of contributions : terms due to possible covariant accelerations of the emitter or the receiver ; a sort of kinematic term due to the possible boost of the receiver relative to the emitter ; and the curvature integral estimated in the previous section .",
    "it is the last which will be important , as will now be explained .",
    "recall that our main hope for detecting gravitational waves by this effect comes not from relative magnitudes of these terms ( the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the earth is far larger than the expected gravitational - radiation effects ) , but from the different time - dependences of the terms .",
    "we must assume that we can account for any source and receiver accelerations well enough to distinguish the effects from those of possible gravitational waves .",
    "the kinematic term @xmath277 requires a bit more discussion , though . here",
    "@xmath140 is the difference between @xmath278 and @xmath119 , parallel - propagated along the null geodesic .",
    "while in the situations we shall consider the zeroth - order contribution to this will have a different time - dependence than the gravitational - wave effects , the first - order contribution will be affected by the gravitational radiation .",
    "however the corresponding effects are suppressed by a factor of @xmath279 ( essentially because they involve velocities rather than accelerations ) , as inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ deltsqcheq ] ) , ( [ wavechange ] ) shows ; see the discussion under point ( b ) in 3.1 .",
    "we thus consider only the curvature - integral contributions to the time - dilation .",

    "( again we assume the emission occurs near the point of closest approach  more generally one would replace the factors of @xmath287 with @xmath288 , in accord with ( [ ttimeqtheta ] )  , and that the motion of the receiver relative to the emitter is sub - relativistic . )",
    "we recall that the analysis of the previous section assumed that the light emission occurred in the gravitational wave zone .",
    "this means that we must have @xmath289 .",
    "( emissions from points closer to the gravitational source could be studied by the general formulas given earlier , but they would correspond to near- or intermediate - zone gravitational disturbances , which had not propagated far enough for their wave character to be fully developed . )",
    "thus we have @xmath290 and @xmath291 for rough estimates of the largest possible red - shift and time - offset due to light emissions near the geodesic s point of closest approach , in the gravitational wave zone , for a given gravitational - wave source .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in much of the literature ,",
    "gravitational radiation is estimated by a combination @xmath292 of the linearised metric components at the earth . while useful for discussions involving terrestrial detectors , this measure is neither invariant nor intrinsic ; it is not well - suited for the present considerations .",
    "the measure which is appropriate is the _",
    "bondi news _",
    "@xmath293 , which we have already mentioned .",
    "this is a function of retarded time and angle ; it has a suitable invariance ( bondi  metzner  sachs covariance ) , is intrinsic and dimensionless @xcite .",
    "the gravitational luminosity is @xmath294 ( over the sphere of directions ) . in the quadrupole approximation one",
    "has @xmath295 ( where @xmath177 is a complex null vector coding the direction ) , and so the quantity @xmath296 given in eq .",
    "( [ mndef ] ) is an average of @xmath297 over directions .",
    "there are , however , few numerical values of the news in the literature .",
    "table 1 gives some rough estimates for the news , using @xmath298 where @xmath299 is the gravitational luminosity ( and , for the last four lines , the quadrupole approximation ) .",
    "note that the first three cases correspond to burst - type sources .",
    "it is clear from table 1 that if we should be lucky enough to observe light - signals from the vicinity of an extreme gravitational - wave event , such as an asymmetric supernova or colliding black holes of comparable mass , a great deal of information could be gained .",
    "however , because the gravitational waves decay very quickly in such cases ( typically on a time - scale of order the light - crossing time associated with the mass , that is @xmath300 ) , one would have to already have the telescope trained on the object , and in general this would require extraordinary serendipity .",
    "an exception would be if we could detect an inspiralling system and thus be prepared to monitor light - sources in its vicinity when strong gravitational waves were produced .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we leave aside the possibility of gravitational - wave sources with news any significant fraction of unity .",
    "the best other candidates for detection appear to have binaries as sources of gravitational waves , corresponding to the last two lines in table 1 . for these",
    ", we have @xmath301 for the case of equal masses in a circular orbit and @xmath302 for highly unequal masses @xmath303 in a circular orbit ; in each case @xmath304 is the period .      for neutron - star glitches , the factor @xmath305 in the third line of table  1 corresponds to a spectral resolving power of @xmath306 .",
    "the red - shift will be smaller by a factor @xmath307 , and for a light - source ten light - seconds away from the glitching neutron star ( say , a companion ) this is likely @xmath308 ( taking @xmath309 ms ) , giving @xmath310 .",
    "radial components of stellar velocities are measured , interferometrically , to @xmath311 @xcite ; however , such precisions typically require integration times of a minute or more , whereas the glitches are thought to decay over milliseconds .",
    "for the other sources we considered , the red - shifts would be smaller , and hence we now move on to the possibilities of detecting the wanderings of times - of - arrival of signals from pulsars .",
    "we now come to the possibility of measuring the offsets caused in pulsar signals times - of - arrival caused by their passage through gravitational waves .",
    "we saw above ( eq .",
    "( [ taumax ] ) ) that the maximum offset was roughly @xmath312 .",
    "the effect is therefore determined by a ratio of the intrinsic gravitational wave strength @xmath296 to the gravitational wave period @xmath143 , and we must consider this for different classes of sources .",
    "first , however , let us consider what temporal resolution we might get from the pulsar signals .      as account of pulsar and timing is given by @xcite . while millisecond pulsars can have extraordinary long - term stability , that stability is essentially a secular effect , based on measuring the times and numbers of pulses between initial and final pulses years apart , and having only to reckon with the uncertainties in locating the times of arrival of those initial and final signals .",
    "except in searching for very low frequency gravitational waves ( or ` memory ' effects , which are essentially zero - frequency phenomena ) , that stability is not of direct help .",
    "we must consider timing over shorter scales .",
    "there are two key issues : that pulsars are weak radio sources , and that their signals over a period appear to be subject to intrinsic variations , jitter and drifting sub - pulses .",
    "because of these , one can not extract very accurate times of arrival from individual pulses ; instead one must fold them , that is , integrate ( typically over a few minutes ) with a mean periodicity removed in order to get a good pulse profile .",
    "one may then have a resolution around @xmath313 .",
    "if we search for effects corresponding to shifts in the times of arrival of order @xmath314 , we need of order @xmath315 samplings , each of some minutes length .",
    "there are about @xmath316 minutes in a year , and so it would be very hard to track changes smaller than @xmath317 by this crude statistical means with current technology",
    ".    however , were we to learn more about the jitter and sub - pulse drift , we might be able to do better .",
    "most of the effects considered here will have fairly well - defined periods , and the question is whether those fourier components could be distinguished from the jitter and drift .",
    "these displacements of the times - of - arrival would show up in the fourier domain as splittings of the angular frequencies of the components of the signal by @xmath318 , or as peaks in the fourier - transformed residuals , at angular frequencies @xmath318 .",
    "the case where the pulsar is one member of a binary , the other member being a neutron star gravitationally radiating due to an asymmetry or instability ( fourth line of table 1 ) , turns out not to be very promising .",
    "( note that here the gravitational radiation in question is _ not _ due to the binary system . )",
    "taking the case of a non - axisymmetric neutron star considered by @xcite , we have @xmath319 where @xmath304 is the period of rotation . using table 1",
    ", we see that in optimistic circumstances for persistent waves , we might have effects as large as @xmath320 .",
    "this is very small .",
    "contours of approximate maximum time - offsets @xmath7 from two equal masses , each @xmath321 , in a circular orbit of period @xmath304.,width=312 ]    it is more promising to consider as a source of gravitational waves a tight binary , and assume that there is a nearby pulsar .",
    "this pulsar could be a ( relatively distant ) tertiary , or not be directly gravitationally bound but still close by ( as might happen if , for example , both the binary and the pulsar were in a globular cluster ) .",
    "recalling that @xmath322 for the wave character of the binary - induced changes in curvature to be developed at the pulsar , and using eqs .",
    "( [ eqmalg ] ) , ( [ taumax ] ) , we see that for a binary of equal masses , each @xmath321 , in a circular orbit , the maximum offset in pulse time - of - arrival will be @xmath323    figure [ fig : emf ] shows contours for @xmath7 for ( [ emc ] ) .",
    "for example , if we had the component masses @xmath324 and period @xmath325 , we would have @xmath326 .",
    "this ( rough ) estimate of the maximum time - displacement corresponds to the pulsar being at the inner part of the gravitational radiation zone , that is @xmath327 away from the binary .",
    "if the pulsar were as far away as @xmath328 ( representative of interstellar distances in a globular cluster ) , one would have @xmath329 .",

    "[ fig : umf ] . for instance",
    ", if one could find a black hole of mass @xmath332 ( in , say , a globular cluster ) , with a star with mass @xmath330 orbiting in a one - day period , one would have @xmath333 ; again , this limit is set when the pulsar is at the inner part of the gravitational wave zone , in this case a few light - days away from the radiating binary . for a solar - mass star in a ten - year circular orbit about",
    "the @xmath334 presumed black hole at the galactic centre , we should have @xmath335 , and this would apply to pulsars around @xmath336 l - yr from that system .    it should be emphasized that these estimates are very rough .",
    "the first main goal of this paper was to present an invariant framework for treating the differential scattering of light - rays in exact general relativity .",
    "this allows one to keep track of the different physical contributions to the various scattering effects , and to focus on quantities of direct physical interest .",
    "the result of greatest near - term possible observational consequence is that light emitted from the vicinities of gravitational - wave sources may be scattered by much larger amounts than those discussed by damour and esposito - farse , and by kopeikin , schfer , gwinn and eubanks .",
    "the results here are however compatible with those authors ; one can understand them as due to ` edge effects ' , whose possibility was explicitly noted by damour and esposito - farsee , and which could be treated within the general formalism of kopeikin et al .",
    "an equivalent statement is that for light emissions at finite distances from the gravitational - wave sources , the scattering depends on the gravitational radiation field , in contrast to the cancellations found by damour , kopeikin et al . which occur in the limit of infinite distances .",
    "the effects do come out to be , roughly , of the scale of those predicted in some of the still earlier papers @xcite , and in a very rough sense one may say that this is because those papers did have the scattering respond to the gravitational radiation fields ; however ( again in accord with damour , kopeikin et al . )",
    "the details of the arguments of those papers are not really compatible with those here .",
    "the main physical issue which was not addressed systematically in earlier work was the effect of the gravitational waves on the motion of the light - sources .",
    "( see however @xcite for an exception . )",
    "this showed up , mathematically , in leaving the results in terms of the coordinate times rather than clock times of the light - emitter and receiver .",
    "such formulas are of direct physical significance only if the coordinates are adapted to the motions of both the light - emitter and receiver .",
    "this issue is particularly problematic when the light - emitter is close enough to the gravitational - wave source that that gravitational effect on the light - emitter s motion must be accounted for .",
    "the present approach works with the clock times and can account for any motions of the light - emitter and receiver .",
    "some candidates for the possible observation of these scattering effects were considered , in a quadrupole approximation for the gravitational waves .",
    "it was found that the best effects to search for were based on the relative distortion of the emitter s proper time @xmath2 as measured by light - signals incoming to the receiver at its proper time @xmath3 .    because these observations would require training a telescope on the emitter , one is driven to look for specific likely sources of gravitational radiation , and these are in general weak ones .",
    "the most promising sort identified here would be a tight binary , the light - emitter being a pulsar orbiting the binary as a distant tertiary , or not gravitationally bound but close by . in an example with favourable but not extreme parameters ( a binary of two @xmath5 stars with a @xmath337 period , and a pulsar about @xmath338 l - min away ) , we found offsets in the times of arrival of the pulsar pulses of the order of @xmath317 , with the offsets varying with a period around an hour .",
    "if we a were able to find a solar - mass star orbiting a @xmath9 black hole with a one - day period , for example in a globular cluster , pulsars a few light - days away might have their pulse times - of - arrival offset by @xmath339 .",
