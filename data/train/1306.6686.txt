    "the problem of computing nash equilibrium is known to be hard ( see @xcite ) , even for two - player games ( see @xcite ) . however , there are still many open questions regarding the complexity of an _ approximate _ nash equilibrium . in this paper",
    "we will focus on one of them .",
    "given a normal form @xmath0-player game with a constant number of actions for each player , how hard is it to compute an approximate nash equilibrium ?",
    "note that in the above problem the size of the input is exponential .",
    "a reasonable model to consider in such a case is the _ query model_. instead of a huge input that contains the whole game , we assume the existence of a _ black box_. for every question of the algorithm about payoffs in the game , the black box returns an answer .",
    "the questions could be about either action profiles ( see section [ sec : main ] ) or distributions over action profiles ( see section [ sec : dist ] ) .",
    "we measure the complexity of an algorithm by the number of queries that it asks .    for every _ deterministic _ algorithm , the query complexity of approximate nash equilibria is exponential in @xmath0 .",
    "this follows from a recent paper by hart and nisan @xcite , where they show that even for the simpler question of approximate correlated equilibria the query complexity is exponential .",
    "this raises the question of the query complexity of an approximate nash equilibrium for _ probabilistic _ algorithms ( for probabilistic algorithms the query complexity of an approximate correlated equilibrium is polynomial in @xmath0 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "this question was posed in @xcite as an open problem . in this paper",
    "we answer this question : the query complexity of an approximate nash equilibrium is exponential , even for probabilistic algorithms ( see theorems [ theo : main ] , [ theo : nedist ] , and [ theo : ane ] ) .",
    "this result has several contributions .",
    "first , for computational complexity , this result provides evidence that it is very unlikely that there is a polynomial ( in @xmath0 ) algorithm for computing an approximate nash equilibrium in this class of games .",
    "this is because if such an algorithm exists , then it must depend on more complex data of the game than just expected payoffs under distributions .",
    "note that for the parallel question of computing an approximate or even an exact correlated equilibrium , such an algorithm exists ( see @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "second , the result provides insights into the rate of convergence of adaptive dynamics to an approximate nash equilibrium ( see section [ sec : dyn ] ) .",
    "the question of the convergence of adaptive dynamics to an exact nash equilibrium ( pure or mixed ) was studied by hart and mansour @xcite , where they provide exponential lower bounds via communication complexity results . however , the problem of convergence to an _ approximate _",
    "nash equilibrium remained open .",
    "our result yields an exponential lower bound on the rate of convergence of adaptive dynamics to an _ approximate _",
    "nash equilibrium ( see corollary [ cor : dyn - pure ] and theorem [ theo : dyn ] ) for a wide class of adaptive dynamics , which we call @xmath3-queries dynamics ( see definition [ def : qd ] ) .",
    "there are also contributions that arise from the proof of the result .",
    "we prove the result by reducing the approximate nash equilibrium problem to the problem of finding an approximate fixed point ( section [ sec : ne->fp ] ) .",
    "then we reduce the approximate fixed - point problem to an end - of - path problem ( section [ sec : fp->ep ] ) . eventually , we prove that the end - of - path problem is hard ( section [ sec : ep->hp ] ) .",
    "the connection between nash equilibria , fixed points , and end - of - path problems is not new .",
    "the classical result about the @xmath4 completeness of the nash equilibrium problem ( see @xcite ) establishes these connections .",
    "however , the established reductions fail to work for an approximate nash equilibrium for constant approximations . beyond the simplicity of our reduction in section [ sec : ne->fp ] , the best of our knowledge this is the first reduction that works for an _ approximate _ notion of nash equilibrium ( the approximate well - supported nash equilibrium ) .",
    "the proof of the result also provides several insights into the approximate fixed - point problem .",
    "the approximate fixed - point problem was studied by hirsch , papdimitriou , and vavasis @xcite for _ deterministic _ algorithms . here",
    "we analyze the same problem for _ probabilistic _ algorithms .",
    "these more general settings allow us to answer an open question that was posed in @xcite on the query complexity of an approximate fixed point in the case where queries are _ distributions over the domain _ ( rather than just a point in the domain ) .",
    "theorem [ theo : fp ] , answers this question in negative : even if the queries are distributions , an exponential number of queries is needed to find an approximate fixed point .",
    "in a recent paper , fearnley , gairing , goldberg , and savani @xcite study the query complexity of an approximate nash equilibrium .",
    "in particular , they derive a lower bound on the complexity of an approximate nash equilibrium in two - player games .",
    "in addition , they provide several classes of @xmath0-player games where a polynomial number of queries is enough to find an approximate nash equilibrium .",
    "the negative result of this paper shows that unlike the above mentioned games , in general games an exponential number of queries is needed .",
    "in the query model every problem @xmath5 is specified by possible inputs , desired outputs , and _",
    "queries_. the queries are specified by the type of questions that can be asked , and by the answers that are provided . a _ query algorithm _ , which in this paper will be called simply _ algorithm _ , is a procedure that asks queries in an adaptive manner and essentially for every input generates an output .",
    "the _ query complexity _ of an algorithm is the number of queries that are asked by the algorithm for the worst - case input .",
    "note that we put no computational constraints on the way the algorithm generates the next query or the output , given the previous answers .",
    "given an input , the number of queries of a probabilistic algorithm is a random variable .",
    "there are two reasonable definitions for the _ query complexity of a probabilistic algorithm_.    one definition is via expectation , namely , the expected number of queries for solving the problem , which is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "another reasonable definition is as follows .",
    "we fix a probability @xmath7 , and we ask what is the number of queries that are required in order to provide the correct answer with probability @xmath7 .",
    "we denote this number of queries by @xmath8 .",
    "[ rem : qq ] note that there is a close relation between these two definitions .",
    "@xmath9 the first inequality follows from markov inequality .",
    "the second inequality follows from the fact that we can repeat the same algorithm until we will find a correct answer .",
    "the results in the present paper are formulated using @xmath10 . by the above remark",
    "we can easily translate all the results on @xmath10 to results on @xmath11 .",

    "the payoff function @xmath22 can be multilinearly extended into @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the _ payoffs profile _ is denoted by @xmath24 , and we will identify the game with @xmath25 .    given a profile of mixed actions @xmath26 where @xmath19 , we denote by @xmath27 the best - reply value of player @xmath14 , i.e. , the maximal payoff that player @xmath14 can get against opponents strategy @xmath28 .",
    "a profile is an @xmath2__-nash equilibrium _ _ ( @xmath2-ne for short ) if no player can gain more than @xmath2 by deviating to a different strategy , i.e. , @xmath29 for every player @xmath14 .",
    "a profile of mixed actions @xmath26 is called an @xmath2-_well - supported nash equilibrium _ ( @xmath2-wsne for short ) if every player assigns positive probability only to actions that are an @xmath2-best reply , i.e. , if @xmath30 then @xmath31 .",
    "note that every @xmath2-wsne is an @xmath2-ne , but not vice versa .",
    "nevertheless , we can construct an approximate wsne from an approximate ne by relaxing the approximation from @xmath2 to @xmath32 .",

    "this theorem is in contrast to the correlated equilibrium case , where the regret - minimizing algorithms ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) require only a polynomial number of queries to find an approximate correlated equilibrium .",

    "* outline of the proof of theorem [ theo : main ] . *",
    "the proof is done in three steps .    in the first step ( section [ sec : ne->fp ] ) , we reduce the problem of finding approximated wsne in a @xmath38-player game to the problem of finding an approximate fixed point of a lipschitz continuous @xmath0-dimensional mapping . for every function @xmath44",
    "we define a game @xmath45 ( see equations ( [ eq : payoff - def1 ] ) and ( [ eq : payoff - def2 ] ) ) , such that every approximate wsne of @xmath46 corresponds to an approximate fixed point of @xmath44 .",

    "the proof appears in a blog by eran shmaya @xcite .    in the second step ( section [ sec : fp->ep ] )",
    ", we introduce the reduction of hirsch , papadimitriou , and vavasis @xcite from the problem of finding an approximate fixed point of an @xmath0-dimensional mapping to the problem of finding the end of a simple path ( path with no cycles ) on the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube . for every simple path @xmath47",
    ", they construct in a mapping @xmath48 such that every fixed point of @xmath44 corresponds to the end of the path @xmath47 ( see properties ( p1)(p3 ) in remark [ rem : pro ] ) .",
    "finally , in the third step ( section [ sec : ep->hp ] ) , we prove that the end of a simple path is a hard problem , even in probabilistic settings .",
    "hart and nisan @xcite show that the end of a path ( not necessarily a simple one ) is a hard problem . using similar arguments to those in @xcite",
    ", we strengthen this hardness result : it is hard to find the end of a path , even if it is known that the path is simple .",
    "in theorem [ theo : main ] we considered the model where each query is a pure action profile @xmath49 in the game .",
    "we would like to generalize the exponential lower bound of theorem [ theo : main ] to the case where each query can be a _ distribution _ over action profiles @xmath50 .",
    "the most natural model that comes to mind is the one where the answer to the query @xmath51 is the exact value @xmath52 .",

    "theorem [ theo : nedist ] emphasizes even more the difference from the correlated equilibrium case .",

    "the formal definition is as follows :    [ def : qd ] a dynamic will be called @xmath3-queries dynamic , if there exists a mapping that assigns to each history of play a set of @xmath3 ( additional ) pure actions payoff queries , such that the mixed strategy of all players at time @xmath121 can be calculated using the @xmath135 queries until time @xmath121 .",
    "we argue that most studied adaptive dynamics are @xmath136-queries dynamics .",
    "example [ ex : rel ] illustrates the fact that _ regret based _ dynamics are @xmath136-queries dynamics .",

    "better reply dynamics _ are also @xmath136-queries dynamics , because the mixed action of every player @xmath14 at time @xmath121 depends on the set of payoffs @xmath137 , which again requires @xmath136 queries .",

    "therefore , from theorem [ theo : main ] we get the following corollary regarding the rate of convergence of @xmath3-queries dynamics :    [ cor : dyn - pure ] there is no @xmath3-queries dynamic that converges to a @xmath37-well - supported nash equilibrium in @xmath139 steps with probability of at least @xmath40 in all @xmath38-player games with @xmath39 actions for all players .",
    "there are important dynamics , as for example the fictitious - play dynamic ( see @xcite ) , where in order to calculate the mixed action of the player using small number of queries we must use _ mixed _ action queries , rather than pure . in fictitious - play for example",

    "we can similarly define @xmath3__-mixed - queries _ _ dynamics , or more general class of @xmath3__-distribution - queries _ _ dynamics . in order to derive a lower bound on the rate of convergence of those dynamics we should rely on the impossibility result of theorem [ theo : nedist ] , which corresponds to the case where the queries could be mixed actions , or more general distributions over action profiles .",
    "a difficulty arises when we try to do so .",
    "the query model in theorem [ theo : nedist ] assumes that the answers are given with a precision @xmath63 , whereas in the dynamics model the answers are precise .",
    "an additional assumption of _ continuity of the dynamic _",
