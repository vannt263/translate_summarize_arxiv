    "the rg flow is illustrated in fig .",

    "the non - trivial correction can be understood as the _ strong _ screening effect with the anomalous dimension .",
    "considering the different scaling between the @xmath70 and @xmath71 directions , we obtain @xmath72 at the stable fixed point .",

    "then , the momentum anisotropy gives @xmath74 at the stable fixed point .",
    "therefore the renormalized coulomb interaction has the following structure @xmath75 at the fixed point .",
    "it means that in the real space @xmath76 depends on the spatial coordinate @xmath77 anisotropically as @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the novel quantum effect in interacting awf can induce unusual dielectric responses of the system . here",
    "we consider the screening problem of a coulomb impurity with the electric charge @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) by awf . because of the non - trivial quantum corrections caused by interacting fermions , the distribution of the screening charge in interacting awf can be completely different from that in the non - interacting system .",
    "let us first consider the noninteracting awf coupled to a single charged impurity , which can be described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the coupling constant of the noninteracting system .",
    "in fact , because of the anisotropic momentum dependence of the polarization function which can be summarized as @xmath84 with the positive constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the screening charges distribute in a highly unusual way even in the noninteracting system . according to the linear response theory ,",
    "the induced charge density is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inducedcharge ] , the peculiar structure of @xmath66 gives rise to strong spatial anisotropy in the distribution of the induced charges in real space , @xmath89 .",
    "in particular , owing to the anisotropy of @xmath90 , the partially integrated charge densities @xmath91 and @xmath92 show characteristic coordinate dependence such as @xmath93 where @xmath94 in which @xmath95 indicates the bessel function of the first kind . here",
    "@xmath96 is defined as @xmath97 with the in - plane momentum cutoff @xmath51 .",
    "this sharp momentum cutoff causes the oscillation of @xmath98 with fixed amplitude .",
    "notice that the partially integrated charge densities distribute in a highly unusual way , i.e. , @xmath99 is strongly localized near the impurity while @xmath100 shows slow decay with a power - law tail .",
    "the detailed behavior of @xmath90 is shown in supplementary note 3 .",
    "surprisingly , the strong coulomb interaction between electrons completely modify the screening charge distribution in awf .",
    "since all coupling constants are irrelevant at the stable fixed point , the induced charge can be computed to the leading order by using @xmath101 and @xmath84 .",
    "since the amount of the total induced charge is fixed , i.e. , @xmath102 , @xmath103 is fixed to be @xmath24 , which gives rise to @xmath104 .",
    "in contrast to the case of the noninteracting system , the screening charge is strictly localized near the impurity site .",
    "similar localized distribution of the induced charge is predicted in graphene .",
    "@xcite in graphene , it is shown that the coulomb interaction can induce small spreading of the screening charge in subleading order .",
    "in our case such an additional spreading of the screening charge can only play a minor role since the coulomb interaction is irrelevant at the fixed point while it is marginal in graphene .  @xcite",
    "up to now we have considered the system having a single awf . however , in real materials , several awfs can simultaneously appear at the fermi level due to the time - reversal or crystalline symmetries . in this case , to describe the renormalized coulomb interaction , it is necessary to add the contribution from all awfs to the polarization .",
    "in other words , the polarization function should be given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 indicates the polarization due to the @xmath107th awf .",
    "here it is assumed that the polarization induced by the coupling between neighboring awfs can be neglected , which is valid if the distance between awfs is far enough .",
    "the important point is that the direction along which the awf shows the quadratic dispersion can vary for different awfs in general .",
    "therefore in the system with multiple awfs , the total polarization should behave as @xmath108 on average with @xmath109 . in this case",
    ", the renormalized coulomb interaction should have the following form of @xmath110 .",
    "equivalently , it means that the long range coulomb interaction shows the unusual power law given by @xmath111 in real space due to the screening effect .",
    "if we introduce a charged impurity to this system , the induced charge spreads in a way of @xmath112 when the electron - electron interaction is neglected . on the other hand ,",
    "once the electron - electron interaction is considered , the induced charge is again strictly localized near the impurity site , i.e. , @xmath113 with a constant @xmath114 .",
    "the results from our perturbative rg approach are further supported by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) approach . as shown in the supplementary note 4",
    ", we find that along the direction with linear ( quadratic ) dispersion , the momentum dependence of the polarization shows @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "note that the rpa and the one - loop rg calculations match perfectly , thus we believe that the results of the one - loop rg calculation is _",
    "robust_. besides the fact that two different methods give the same momentum dependence of @xmath66 , we further consider the corrections to the rpa results by performing the strong coupling expansion .",
    "as shown in supplementary note 5 , it is explicitly proved that the quantum fluctuations near the stable fixed point do not cause any divergent corrections confirming the robustness of the conclusions obtained from the rg analysis .    to conclude",
    ", we have rigorously demonstrated the novel quantum critical phenomena of the awf .",
    "we emphasize that the anisotropic partial screening is clearly distinct from the conventional screening phenomena in usual metallic or semi - metallic systems , which is concisely summarized in table 1 .",
    "for example , the thomas fermi screening in conventional metals forces the renormalized coulomb interaction to be short - ranged and the fermionic excitations coupled by the short range repulsive interaction gives rise to the fermi liquid state .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , in the awf , the interplay between the coulomb interaction and fermions induces the anisotropic partial screening , which allows the screened coulomb interaction to maintain the long - ranged nature and the fermions to be free from the coulomb interaction in the low energy limit .",
    "therefore the anisotropic partial screening can be considered as the intermediate screening phenomena distinguished from both the thomas - fermi screening in metals and the logarithmic screening in dirac fermions , which is uncovered for the first time in this study .                                                              , and grant - in - aids for scientific research ( no .",

    "<S> * topological phase transitions in condensed matters accompany emerging singularities of the electronic wave function , often manifested by gap - closing points in the momentum space . in conventional topological insulators in three dimensions ( 3d ) , the low energy theory near the gap - closing point can be described by relativistic dirac fermions coupled to the long range coulomb interaction , hence the quantum critical point of topological phase transitions provides a promising platform to test the novel predictions of quantum electrodynamics . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that a new class of quantum critical phenomena emanates in topological materials breaking either the inversion symmetry or the time - reversal symmetry . at the quantum critical point , </S>",
    "<S> the theory is described by the emerging low energy fermions , dubbed the anisotropic weyl fermions , which show both the relativistic and newtonian dynamics simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between the anisotropic dispersion and the coulomb interaction brings about a new screening phenomena distinct from the conventional thomas - fermi screening in metals and logarithmic screening in dirac fermions . *    </S>",
    "<S> fathoming quantum phases and the associated phase transitions is one of the most significant problems in modern condensed matter physics . through the natural extension of classical order parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the conventional symmetry breaking paradigm has been successfully applied to quantum systems and has deepened our understanding , especially of magnetism and superconductivity.@xcite on the other hand , the recent theoretical advances in the study of topological orders have provided solid theoretical grounds to predict exotic topological phases . due to the lack of the classical counterparts , </S>",
    "<S> the description of these exotic topological phases and the phase transitions between them is far beyond the realm of the conventional paradigm.@xcite for instance , through the recent active studies of the systems with strong spin - orbit coupling , a new topological semi - metal ( sm ) , dubbed the weyl sm , is proposed in systems such as a@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite or topological insulator multilayers  @xcite . in weyl sm , composed of several gapless points ( weyl points ) on the fermi energy @xmath2 , the bulk energy spectrum shows the 3d linear dispersion relation around each weyl point ( wp ) . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the conventional phases distinguished by order parameters , the weyl sm is characterized by the topological number , so - called the chirality of wp whose nontrivial topological nature gives rise to the `` fermi arc '' surface states . </S>",
    "<S> since the chirality of each wp guarantees its stability , the topological phase transition from the weyl sm must accompany the pair - annihilation of wps .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in this way , the nature of the weyl sm and its topological phase transition can be clearly described as long as the interaction between electrons is neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the complete understanding of topological phases and related phase transitions in interacting weyl sm requires the careful consideration of electron correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , because of the relativistic nature of the electronic dispersion in weyl sm , the fermionic excitations coupled to the long range coulomb interaction induce logarithmic corrections to all physical quantities .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite moreover , in the presence of the cubic and time reversal symmetries , the interplay between the fermions and the long range coulomb interaction induces the non - fermi liquid phase after the pair - annihilation of wps .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in fact , in generic systems without high symmetries , the pair - annihilation of wps generates insulating phases as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . since the critical point is connected to the insulating phase , the effective theory of the quantum phase transition should respect the zero - chirality condition . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the minimal model for the phase transition is the 3d anisotropic weyl fermion ( awf ) whose dispersion is quadratic along one direction but linear along the other two orthogonal directions . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to note that awf can emerge ubiquitously in materials breaking either the time - reversal symmetry or the inversion symmetry , and mediate various topological phase transitions .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for instance , the recent theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies on bitei have shown that the same critical theory describes the direct topological phase transition between the trivial and topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> therefore for the universal description of topological quantum phase transitions in generic topological materials , it is crucial to unveil the intriguing quantum criticality of the 3d awf coupled to the long range coulomb interaction , which is the main subject in this study .    </S>",
    "<S> the main finding of this work is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , we find that the anisotropic dispersion of awf induces exotic screening effects . </S>",
    "<S> namely , significant screening appears along the direction with linear dispersion of electrons in the sense that the momentum dependence of the coulomb potential is strongly modified from the bare value along that direction . on the other hand , along the direction with quadratic dispersion of electrons , </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb potential is just weakly modified . </S>",
    "<S> we call this the _ anisotropic partial screening _ phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , such a nontrivial screening effect makes the coulomb interaction _ irrelevant _ in the low energy limit . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the critical theory becomes a _ </S>",
    "<S> non - interacting _ fermion theory eventually , which allows the complete theoretical understanding of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is in sharp contrast to the cases of other sms such as graphene and conventional weyl sm with isotropic dispersion where the coulomb potential remains marginal in the infrared limit rendering various physical quantities to receive logarithmic temperature dependence .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the nontrivial screening effect of interacting awf can give rise to intriguing dielectric responses of the system , which will be discussed below . </S>"
