    "transition state theory ( tst ) @xcite plays a central role in chemistry because it provides both a tantalizingly simple approach to calculating chemical reaction rates and an intuitive interpretation of reaction mechanisms through the identification of the bottleneck between reactants and products .",
    "although the rate could in principle be calculated exactly using known methods , in practice , it is often out of reach because such computations are laborious , even if quantum effects are ignored.@xcite therefore , the tst approximation to the rate has played a central role in kinetics , but its accuracy hinges on the optimal identification of the ts dividing surface.@xcite indeed tst is exact when the latter is crossed once and only once by each reactive trajectory.@xcite while a constructive prescription for a no - recrossing ts dividing surface has long been sought , it was only in the 70 s that it was found in the special case of low - dimensional systems.@xcite a general method that yields a no - recrossing ts dividing surface for reactions in arbitrarily many ( but finite ) degrees of freedom has been described only recently .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , even approximate ts dividing surfaces located near the phase - space bottlenecks between reactants and products provide a portrait of the activated complex that has been used routinely in the chemistry community .",
    "reactions in solution are even more complex : the presence of the solvent introduces a complicated many - body problem .",
    "nevertheless , tst has been remarkably successful at providing accurate estimates of thermal reaction rates when a reasonable ts dividing surface can be identified .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , such estimates are seldom exact because the dividing surfaces available in the literature are not strictly free of recrossings .",
    "one approach lies in choosing the dividing surface so as to minimize the tst reaction rate .",
    "@xcite the recrossing problem is thereby alleviated , but usually not eliminated .",
    "alternatively , one can eliminate consideration of the nonreactive trajectories entirely by sampling the transition path ensemble ( tpe ) directly.@xcite all such paths intersect the ts dividing surface and hence , as a collection , they provide a portrait of the activated complex . using monte carlo approaches,@xcite tpe",
    "can also be readily applied to complex molecular reactions in all - atom solvents but it does not provide the simple geometric picture of a dividing surface free of recrossings .    the geometry of the finite dimensional no - recrossing ts dividing surface is described in this paper for chemical reactions that can be represented using stochastic models of the solvent interactions . the moving ts dividing surface is most readily constructed in cases of uniform solvents such as those represented by the langevin equation as was summarized in a recent letter.@xcite the present article expands that discussion , and extends the results to the colored noise case of the generalized langevin equation .",
    "it should be noted that a finite - dimensional - like ts dividing surface can be specified if an explicit infinite - dimensional model _viz . _  an infinite collection of harmonic oscillators is used to represent the heat bath in the langevin equation.@xcite in spite of its simplicity",
    ", this model leads to an excellent approximation to the rate constant@xcite that , remarkably , has been rederived without recourse to an explicit model of the heat bath.@xcite within the finite - dimensional phase space of the solute , the reaction geometry has also been illustrated using the stochastic separatrix ( i.e. , the collection of all phase space points for which the reaction probability is 50% . ) that work portends the present development.@xcite    in this paper , we introduce a generalized view of the transition state that allows for the temporal variation of the solvent .",
    "while this has not yet been accomplished in an all - atom representation , we show here that if the solvent is modeled through the langevin equation , a time - dependent ts dividing surface can be constructed that is strictly free of recrossings .",
    "this is achieved by identifying a privileged stochastic trajectory that remains in the vicinity of the barrier for all time .",
    "this transition state trajectory serves as a moving origin to which geometric structures in a noiseless phase space , such as invariant manifolds and a no - recrossing surface@xcite are attached .",
    "the time - dependent dividing surface thus obtained adds to the evolving understanding of the geometric structures separating reactants from products in the presence of noise .",
    "the picture presented here provides a detailed time - resolved description of the reaction dynamics and , in particular , gives a precise geometric interpretation of the collective reaction coordinate introduced in ref .  .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows : section  [ sec : prelim ] recapitulates the macroscopic model of the solvent dynamics represented by the langevin equation . in section  [ sec :",
    "fund ] , we introduce the fundamental construction that allows us to separate the full dynamics into the noisy ts trajectory and the noiseless relative motion . the ts trajectory for a particle driven by a white noise bath",
    "is described explicitly in section  [ sec : wn ] .",
    "the construction is simple and direct , and requires no more effort than that for a typical trajectory .",
    "several statistical properties of the ts trajectory are also discussed in section  [ sec : wn ] .",
    "in addition , the ts trajectory is used to to compute reaction probabilities and the stochastic separatrix .",
    "the generalization of the ts trajectory to the chemically important case of colored noise is discussed in section  [ sec : coloured ] .",
    "the influence of the solvent on a chemical motion or reaction coordinate , @xmath0 , has been routinely represented using the langevin equation ( le ) of motion,@xcite @xmath1 or its generalization ( gle ) to allow for colored noise.@xcite in eq .",
    "[ le ] , the vector @xmath0 denotes a set of mass - weighted coordinates in a configuration space of arbitrary dimension @xmath2 , @xmath3 the potential of mean force governing the reaction , @xmath4 a symmetric positive - definite friction matrix and @xmath5 a stochastic force .",

    ", there are infinitely many different trajectories @xmath8 that are distinguished by their initial conditions at some time @xmath9 .",
    "note that no restriction on the dimensionality of the configuration space is imposed and the derivations below work in one as well as in many dimensions .",
    "although in eq .",
    "[ le ] , the deterministic force is formally assumed to be derived from a potential @xmath3 , it would be straightforward to include velocity - dependent forces from , e.g. , a magnetic field.@xcite meanwhile , the stochastic force @xmath5 is assumed to be gaussian distributed with zero mean .",
    "it is related to the symmetric positive - definite friction matrix @xmath4 through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xcite @xmath10 where the angular brackets denote the average over the instances @xmath6 of the fluctuating force , and the dirac @xmath11 function appears because white noise is local in time .",
    "the assumption of white noise in eq .",
    "[ fdtwhite ] is consistent with the le : it requires that the dynamics of the heat bath , which determines the correlation time of the fluctuating force , takes place on much shorter time scales than the dynamics along the chosen system coordinates _viz .",
    "_ , the reaction coordinate and any other solute or solvent modes coupled to it .",
    "this is not always the case in applications relevant to chemistry where the dynamical time scales of the system and the bath are usually comparable .",
    "nevertheless , the special case of white noise is treated in detail in the next two sections because it accommodates an explicit description of the relevant geometric structures .",
    "the generalization of the moving ts structures to the gle is formally straightforward though mathematically more cumbersome . in the case of colored noise",
    ", the fluctuation dissipation theorem requires that the friction kernel be nonlocal in time , _ viz .",
    "_  contain memory.@xcite the ts trajectory is nevertheless computable and is presented in section  [ sec : coloured ] .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , each of the geometric structures associated with the gle is analogous to that in the le .",
    "a further assumption in this work requires that the the reactant and product regions in configuration space are separated by a potential barrier , as is the case for most chemical reactions .",
    "the position of the barrier is marked by a saddle point @xmath12 of the potential @xmath3 . in the absence of noise",
    ", the saddle point is a fixed point of the dynamics .",
    "the invariant manifolds that determine the relevant phase space geometry @xcite are attached to it . in the presence of a fluctuating force , the geometric structures fixed at the saddle point no longer determine the reaction .",
    "as shown below , however , there is a unique stochastic trajectory @xmath13 that can play the role of the saddle point and serve as the carrier of invariant manifolds .    because the reaction rate is determined by the dynamics in a small neighborhood of the saddle point,@xcite the deterministic force in the le of eq .",
    "[ le ] can be linearized around the saddle point to yield @xmath14 where the first term in the rhs involves the symmetric force constant matrix , @xmath15 although any rectilinear coordinate system can be chosen , it is convenient to choose the one for which the force matrix , @xmath16 is diagonal from the outset . in eq",
    "[ linle ] , @xmath17 is the reaction coordinate , @xmath18 the barrier frequency and @xmath19 the frequencies of oscillations in the stable transverse normal modes @xmath20 .",
    "the aim in the following is first to construct a no - recrossing surface for eq .",
    "[ linle ] and then to generalize the construction to correlated noise .",
    "it is well known that in the absence of noise and of dissipation which are closely related by eq .",
    "[ fdtwhite] the phase - space hypersurface ( @xmath21 ) is free of recrossings.@xcite . as shown below , the damping does not pose particular difficulties .",
    "the noise , however , does , because the fluctuating force leads the particle to move randomly back and forth , so that it will typically cross and recross any fixed dividing surface many times .",
    "we will overcome this difficulty by constructing a dividing surface that is itself randomly moving such as to avoid recrossing . to achieve this ,",
    "the dividing surface must be constructed as a function of the fluctuating force .",
    "given any two trajectories @xmath8 and @xmath13 under the influence of the same fluctuating force , we define the relative coordinate , @xmath22 it describes the location of the trajectory @xmath8 with respect to the moving origin @xmath13 . by eq .",
    "[ linle ] , the relative coordinate @xmath23 satisfies the deterministic equation of motion @xmath24 and thus exhibits non - random noiseless dynamics .",
    "this result is indicated by the lack of a subscript @xmath6 in @xmath25 . due to the presence of the damping in eq .",
    "[ releq ] , the dynamics of the relative coordinate , though noiseless , is still dissipative .",
    "nevertheless , with respect to the relative dynamics , it is possible to specify a no - recrossing surface , as well as the invariant manifolds of the equilibrium point @xmath26 .",
    "these geometric objects in the noiseless phase space can be regarded as being attached to and propagating with the reference trajectory @xmath13 .",
    "they thus define moving invariant manifolds and a randomly moving no - recrossing surface in the phase space of the original , noisy system .",
    "the relative dynamics between any two trajectories , @xmath8 and @xmath13 , is described by eq .",
    "[ releq ] .",
    "because it is always noiseless , a moving no - recrossing surface can be thought of as attached to any reference trajectory",
    ". however , only a specific surface is relevant for the reaction dynamics : the crossing of the surface should indicate the transition of the trajectory @xmath8 from the reactant to the product side of the barrier .",
    "it can not serve that purpose if it is attached to a reference trajectory that is itself far away from the barrier .",
    "if the reference trajectory is chosen arbitrarily , it will typically descend into either the reactant or the product wells over time and thus lose its ability to carry a chemically meaningful dividing surface . only a reference trajectory that remains in the vicinity of the barrier for all time without ever descending on either side of it can carry a no - recrossing surface that describes the reaction in the same way that a static dividing surface in conventional tst does .",
    "indeed , we will show below that for each instance of the noise there is a unique reference trajectory with this property .",
    "this is the transition state ( ts ) trajectory mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we will henceforth restrict the notation @xmath13 to this particular privileged reference trajectory .",
    "the definition of the ts trajectory as `` remaining close to the saddle point '' for all time might at first appear somewhat vague . in the construction of the ts trajectory",
    "below , it will become clear that the exponential instability that is inherent in the noiseless dynamics associated with eq .",
    "[ linle ] in both the distant past and the remote future must be absent from the ts trajectory .",
    "a precise meaning can be given to the notion in statistical terms as follows : because it is stochastic , at any given time there is a probability distribution for the ts trajectory in phase space .",
    "this distribution is invariant under the time evolution given by eq .",
    "[ linle ] . in mathematical language",
    ", the ts trajectory represents an invariant measure of the noisy dynamical system.@xcite that is , for any instance @xmath27 of the noise , where the dot indicates a function of time , there is an instance @xmath28(t)$ ] of the ts trajectory that is given as a functional of the noise and is itself a function of time , @xmath29 .",
    "it can be used to obtain the instance of the ts trajectory @xmath28(t+\\tau)$ ] that will be found if the origin from which time is measured is moved an increment @xmath30 .",

    "we have now given a general outline of the method .",
    "in the following sections , we will actually construct the ts trajectory , determine its statistical properties and describe the invariant manifolds and the no - recrossing surface attached to it in detail .",

    ", one must consider the behavior of @xmath23 in the remote future and in the distant past and then determine those trajectories that pass across the barrier from the reactant to the product side .",
    "the simplest case occurs in one degree of freedom where @xmath55 reduces to the squared barrier frequency @xmath56 and @xmath4 to a scalar damping coefficient @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", the matrix @xmath40 can be diagonalized analytically .",
    "it possesses the eigenvalues    [ evals ] @xmath58    with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath59 the phase portrait of the dynamics is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase]a .",
    "the eigenvectors corresponding to the positive and negative eigenvalues , respectively , span one - dimensional unstable and stable manifolds of the saddle point .",
    "they act as separatrices between reactive and nonreactive trajectories .",
    "the knowledge of the invariant manifolds allows one to determine the ultimate fate of a specific trajectory from its initial conditions . it should be clear that line",
    ", @xmath60 , in the quadrant of reactive trajectories acts as a surface of no recrossing .    in the absence of damping ( and in units where @xmath61 ) , the invariant manifolds bisect the angles between the coordinate axes .",
    "the presence of damping destroys this symmetry . as the damping constant @xmath57 increases , on obtains the limits , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the unstable manifold rotates toward the @xmath64-axis , the stable manifold toward the @xmath65-axis . in the limit of infinite damping , the invariant manifolds coincide with the axis .",
    "thus , the fraction of phase space on the reactant side that corresponds to reactive trajectories decreases with increasing friction .",
    "this is intuitively clear because if the dissipation is strong , a trajectory must start at a given initial position with a high velocity to overcome the friction and cross the barrier .    in multiple dimensions ,",
    "the dynamics of the single unstable degree of freedom is the same as in the one - dimensional case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase]a .",
    "transverse damped oscillations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase]b , must be added to this picture .",
    "their presence manifests itself , for small damping , through @xmath66 complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues @xmath41 . for stronger damping ,",
    "some of the transverse modes can become overdamped , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : phase]c , so that further eigenvalues become negative real . in any case",
    ", there is exactly one unstable eigenvalue with positive real part .",
    "this eigenvalue is actually real and corresponds to the system sliding down the barrier . in all other directions ,",
    "the dynamics is stable , and at least one eigenvalue is negative real .",
    "the dynamics in the distant past is determined by the eigenvalue or pair of eigenvalues with the largest negative real part .",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to the most stable eigenvalue together with the unstable eigenvector span a plane in phase space in which the dynamics is given by the phase portrait of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase]a . because the dynamics in all other , `` transverse '' directions is stable , the separatrices between reactive and nonreactive trajectories that we identified for the one - dimensional dynamics together with the transverse subspace form separatrices in the high - dimensional phase space . in a similar manner ,",
    "a no - recrossing curve in the plane together with the transverse directions form a no - recrossing surface in the full phase space .",
    "if the most stable eigenvalues occur as a complex conjugate pair , the leading dynamics in the remote past is given by an oscillation across the barrier that , because it is strongly damped , has a huge amplitude in the distant past and causes the system to cross the barrier infinitely often .",
    "this behavior is clearly unphysical .",
    "in fact , once the oscillations become large , nonlinearities of the reaction dynamics become relevant , and the ultimate fate of the trajectory can no longer be determined from the linear approximation .",
    "this situation can only occur if the damping is strong and at the same time the undamped transverse frequencies are so large that the corresponding eigenmodes do not become overdamped .",
    "this rare situation is ignored below .",
    "an exception to the discussion above occurs if for any eigenvector @xmath67 the component @xmath68 in the direction of the reaction coordinate is zero . in this case",
    "the excitation of the corresponding eigenmode has no impact on whether a trajectory is reactive or nonreactive .",
    "the unstable and the most stable eigenvalues must then be chosen among the eigenvalues with @xmath69 , which we call the `` relevant '' eigenvalues . because the unstable eigenmode corresponds to the particle sliding down the barrier , it is always relevant",
    ". similarly , there must be one relevant negative eigenvalue corresponding to the particle being shot at the barrier from infinity and coming to rest on it .",
    "the occurrence of irrelevant eigenvalues might seem a rather unlikely exception , but it does arise in the important special case of isotropic friction , where the friction coefficient @xmath70 is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix .",
    "in this situation , the friction does not couple different normal modes of the undamped dynamics , and all but two eigenvalues are irrelevant .",
    "in particular , our construction of a no - recrossing surface can always be carried out for isotropic friction .",
    "the influence of noise in the equation of motion , eq .  [ diageq ] , can be accounted for by means of the retarded green s function @xmath71 which satisfies @xmath72 it gives the general solution of eq .",
