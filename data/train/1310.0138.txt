    "relativistic flows are likely to be encountered in accretion discs around compact objects like neutron stars and black holes , astrophysical jets , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) etc . a fluid",
    "is said to be relativistic if the bulk speed of the plasma is comparable to the speed of light ( @xmath0 ) , or if its thermal energy is comparable or greater than its rest energy  a fancy way of saying , that the random or jittery speed of the constitute particles of the fluid become comparable to the speed of light . this brings the issue of equation of state ( eos ) of the fluid .",
    "the issue of relativistic equation of state was raised long ago ( chandrasekhar 1938 , hereafter c38 ; taub 1948 ; synge 1957 , hereafter s57 ) , and was used for theoretical calculations too ( blumenthal & mathews 1976 , hereafter bm76 ; fukue 1987 ) , although didnot become very popular in the community .",
    "later falle & komissarov ( 1996 ) showed that the relativistic eos of the form presented by c38 and s57 , is computationally expensive which led mignone ( 2005 ) to use the eos of the form presented by bm76 .",
    "ryu ( 2006 , hereafter rcc06 ) , proposed a new eos , which is very close to the eos by c38 and s57 , and better than the eos proposed by bm76 , and which can be efficiently implemented in a simulation code .",
    "however , these eos states are for single species fluid .",
    "chattopadhyay ( 2008 ; hereafter c08 ) , chattopadhyay & ryu ( 2009 ; hereafter cr09 ) then modified the single species eos for multi - species eos , and analytically showed that the the accreting and solutions around black holes are indeed dependent on the composition of the flow .",
    "more interestingly , cr09 showed that electron - positron jets are the least relativistic when compared with flows containing protons .",
    "the most relativistic flow is the one with composition parameter ( defined as the ratio proton to electron number density ) @xmath1 .",
    "later chattopadhyay & chakrabarti ( 2011 ; hereafter cc11 ) showed that , fluids containing protons can produce accretion shocks while an entirely leptonic fluid ( @xmath2 ) will not be able to form accretion shocks .",
    "although it is difficult to envisage an accreting flow entirely composed of leptons electrons - positrons from close to the horizon to infinity , however , our main intention is to show that  ( 1 ) fluid behaviour do depend on composition even in absence of composition , and ( 2 ) it is erroneous to a assume the most relativistic matter fluid is the lightest one that is pair plasma . in this paper therefore we want to compute the radiation produced by flow accreting onto a black hole , and show that indeed the spectra also depends on the composition of the fluid even if the outer boundary condition is the same .",
    "for that purpose we have developed a general relativistic monte - carlo code .",
    "we assume a non - rotating black hole described by the schwarzschild radii @xmath3 where , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath0 are the universal gravitational constant , the mass of the central black hole and the speed of light , respectively , and @xmath6 are the usual four coordinates .",
    "@xmath7 where , the energy momentum tensor of the fluid is @xmath8 , the radiation stress - tensor being @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the total number density of the fluid .",
    "the fluid equation is solved theoretically assuming there is no radiation .",
    "and then it is fed to the general relativistic monte carlo code .",
    "the monte carlo code estimates bremsstrahlung emission from each grid point , and then the emitted photons travels and impinges on the electron at some other point .",
    "if the energy of the photon is less than electrons kinetic or thermal energy then inverse - comptonization , the photon will take energy away",
    ". if the the photon energy is more , then the opposite happens .",
    "the energy density of the fluid is given by ( see , c08 , c09 ) , @xmath11 \\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\xi\\left[\\frac{1}{\\eta}+\\theta\\left(\\frac{9\\theta+3/\\eta}{3\\theta+2/\\eta } \\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath12 is the composition parameter , where electron number density @xmath13 , the mass density @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the pressure @xmath17 . for radial and adiabatic flow in steady state , the equation of motion simplifies to the form given in cr09 .",
    "the initial configuration of the fluid is , semi - analytical calculation of an adiabatic radial inflow for bernoulli parameter @xmath18 in units of @xmath19 .",
    "the the electron number density is plotted assuming @xmath20 and particle flux rate to be @xmath21@xmath22s@xmath23 .",
    "this value @xmath24 is the particle flux corresponding to accretion rate @xmath25 for an electron - proton ( ) fluid or a fluid with @xmath26 .",
    "all types of fluid starts with these values of @xmath24 and @xmath27 . in fig .",
    "1a - b , we plot total lepton density @xmath28 ( long dashed ) , temperature @xmath29 ( dashed ) and the radial three velocity @xmath30 ( solid ) are plotted with @xmath31 in log - log scale , for two kinds of fluid the @xmath2 or ( a ) and @xmath26 or ( b ) .",
    "it is to be noted the positron number density ( @xmath32 ) is different for these two fluid , for @xmath2 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 but for @xmath26 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "the @xmath46 s are modified bessel s function of various kind .",
    "now there are at least three reference frames involved , the local comoving frame , the local rest frame and the schwarzschild frame .",
    "the three velocities are measured in the local fixed frame and the cooling rates are calculated in the comoving frame .",
    "the photons , however will be moving in a curved geometry , and would follow geodesic equations .",
    "the coordinate transformations between the locally fixed frame ( @xmath47 ) and the coordinate frame ( @xmath48 ) are given by ( park 2006 ) , @xmath49 and the transformation between local fixed frame ( @xmath47 ) and the comoving frame ( @xmath50 ) are related by lorentz transformation of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 indicates the tetrads and @xmath53 are the components of lorentz transformation .",
    "the photons in strong gravity moves in curved trajectories and the geodesic equations given by weinberg ( 1972 ) , can be written as , @xmath54 moreover the definition of optical depth in curved space and moving media in radial direction , is modified to @xmath55 where , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the lorentz factor , klein nishina cross - section and the directional cosine of the photon",
    ". equations 5 - 11 , are implemented in the monte - carlo code of ghost ( 2011 ) and garain ( 2012 ) , to make the code general relativistic .",
    "therefore , not only the fluid is moving in curved space , but even the photons are doing the same .",
    "the total cooling / heating of fluid is @xmath59 , where , @xmath60 is cooling term , @xmath61 is the total bremsstrahlung loss and @xmath62 is the comptonization term , if there is heating then @xmath62 is negative and if there is cooling then the sign is positive .",
    "@xmath62 has been calculated following pozdnyakov ( 1983 ) .",
    "if @xmath63 is the energy radiated from a grid from unit volume ( @xmath62 or @xmath61 or @xmath60 ) , then the new energy density will be given by , @xmath64 , which will result in new temperature because @xmath65 , @xmath66 where , @xmath67 , @xmath68 $ ] , @xmath69 $ ] , and @xmath70 .",
    "the code updates the new non - dimensional temperature of the fluid @xmath71 , until it converges .",
    "in fig . 2,we show that , photon trajectories of two photons originating from same location at s. one photon escapes and suffers no scattering ( blue ) , while the other scatters ( magenta ) , changes direction and is captured by the black hole at the centre ( location @xmath72 ) .",
    "the arrow heads are the velocity field or @xmath30 as shown in fig . 1a . in schwarzschild metric ,",
    "the trajectories of the photons , which follows geodesic equations , are curved .",
    "it is to be noted that the seed photons generated will depend on @xmath73 , as well as temperature and other relevant quantities . if the fluid is then @xmath26 , then the contribution due to eq .",
    "( 7 ) is zero , while for fluid or when @xmath2 , contribution due to eq .",
    "( 5 ) is zero .    in fig .",
    "3 , we show the convergence of temperature , or in other words , calculating the new temperature at each iteration . the initial temperature ( red )",
    "is decreased as bremsstrahlung and comptonization is considered . at large distances away from the black hole the radiative loss is not much but at @xmath74 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath75 ) , cooling becomes important .",
    "however , close to the horizon the temperature rises , since the cooling time scale is much larger than the infall timescale at those distances .",
    "the temperature converges after few iterations .",
    "final spectra is obtained from the converged temperature ( black ) .    in fig .",
    "4 , we present the combined spectra due to bremsstrahlung and comptonization for fluids of different composition or @xmath2 ( red ) , or @xmath26 ( magenta ) , and @xmath76 ( blue ) .",
    "clearly , fluid which was coldest and the least relativistic is the least luminous and the less energetic in terms of the spectra as well .",
    "this is to be expected since the temperature of fluid is much lower than that by fluids containing protons .",
    "therefore , inverse - comptonization produces much less energetic photons . in this paper , we have compared with flows starting with the same outer boundary condition , namely , at @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79@xmath22s@xmath23 .",
    "we have not injected flows with the same accretion rate , because in that case the number density of particles at the outer boundary for fluid will be much higher than fluids with @xmath76 and fluid .",
    "it has been shown earlier ( c08 , cr09 , cc11 ) that , the solution of relativistic , transonic , and adiabatic accretion depends on the composition of the plasma .",
    "more interestingly , we also showed that , contrary to the expectation , we found that fluid is the least relativistic fluid .",
    "and we conjectured that a purely leptonic flow will be less luminous and of low energy .",
    "since flow is least relativistic and slowest , density should be higher .",
    "this would increase the optical depth , and therefore should be less luminous .",
    "moreover , the temperature of is very low too , so higher energies will not be available through inverse - comptonization .",
    "chattopadhyay ( 2013 ) showed that this is indeed true for a toy model of radiation , where the seed photons were mono - energetic and artificially injected . in this paper , we present preliminary solutions of the total spectra from radial accretion onto black holes by considering realistic seed photons ( bremsstrahlung ) and the comptonization of those photons , and we vindicate the conclusions of chattopadhyay ( 2013 ) .",
    "it may be noted though , that fluid can not completely describe an accretion flow from infinity to the horizon .",
    "this is shown here as an extreme case , the realistic cases are and @xmath76 fluid . in view of the results of cc11 ,",
    "extension of these methods to accretion disc , in presence of all kind of cooling processes , is very interesting .",
    "we are working on it and will be reported elsewhere .",
