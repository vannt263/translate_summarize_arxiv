    "laser spectroscopy is a powerful tool to gain insight into the structure of atoms and molecules .",
    "spectroscopy of optical transitions in highly charged ions ( hcis ) has been proposed for tests of fundamental physics and for superior optical clocks .",
    "for example , due to high relativistic contributions to the binding energy of their electrons , some transitions in hcis are exceptionally sensitive to a change of the fine structure constant @xcite . also , small polarizabilities and high internal fields render hcis insensitive to external perturbations , promising small systematic shifts in atomic clocks based on optical transitions in hcis @xcite . however , laser spectroscopy of hcis is still in its infancy .",
    "the highest resolution in laser spectroscopy of hcis has been demonstrated on the dipole forbidden @xmath4 to @xmath5 transition in ar@xmath3 with a pulsed dye laser , reaching a resolution of @xmath6400mhz of this line with an excited state lifetime of 10ms @xcite .",
    "the measurement was limited by the large kinetic energy of the hcis in the electron beam ion trap .",
    "sympathetic cooling to the mk regime by embedding the ar@xmath3 ions in a laser cooled crystal of be@xmath7 ions has been demonstrated in the cryogenic paul trap experiment ( cryptex ) @xcite .",
    "the seven orders of magnitude reduction in the temperature of the ions enables doppler - limited spectroscopy with a resolution on the order of 100khz .",
    "laser spectroscopy of this transition and similar transitions in other hcis requires a continuous - wave spectroscopy laser that can be adjusted to operate over a large wavelength range and exhibits a linewidth and long - term drift below 100khz as described in this work .",
    "there are several ways to achieve this goal .",
    "the spectroscopy laser can be locked to a passive cavity @xcite , to a stabilized optical frequency comb @xcite , or to a broad atomic or molecular transition either directly @xcite or via a transfer cavity @xcite . in our specific case",
    ", the laser will be transported from ptb in braunschweig , where it is built and calibrated , to the mpik in heidelberg , where the hci spectroscopy will be performed .",
    "while stabilization to a passive cavity can in principle provide the required performance goals , a significant engineering effort is required to make it transportable @xcite and to eliminate unexpected shifts and non - predictable long - term drifts of its resonance frequencies @xcite . for decades",
    ", lasers have been stabilized to atomic references that can in principle provide light with very small long - term drift .",
    "however , typically two issues have to be overcome : often there are no suitable atomic transitions close to the desired spectroscopy laser frequency , and the linewidth of the transition may be broader than requir ed for the target laser linewidth .",
    "both issues can be resolved using a frequency comb referenced to a stable cavity or atomic reference that allows to transfer the stability of the reference to the spectroscopy laser on all relevant time scales @xcite .",
    "however , a comb and a suitable reference are required for such an approach , both of which are resource intensive and therefore not generally available in all laboratories . for bridging frequency ranges of up to a few thz , an eom inside a fabry - perot cavity can be used to produce a narrow band frequency comb @xcite . as an alternative",
    ", a cavity can be used to transfer the stability of a reference laser to the spectroscopy laser @xcite . to achieve simultaneous resonance of both lasers with the transfer cavity ,",
    "at least one of them must be tunable by one free spectral range ( fsr ) . for common cavity lengths",
    "the fsr is on the order of 1ghz .    here",
    ", we report on a setup to stabilize a spectroscopy laser with a wavelength of 882 nm via a transfer cavity to a reference laser operating at the rb d@xmath1-line wavelength of 780 nm .",
    "the reference laser is stabilized to the f=3 to f=4 transition of the @xmath0rb d@xmath1-line using the modulation transfer spectroscopy technique @xcite .",
    "frequency drifts of the atomic reference are suppressed by an active temperature stabilization of the rb vapor cell and magnetic shielding .",
    "we use an evacuated cavity to transfer the stability of the reference laser to the spectroscopy laser , thus avoiding environmental influences that affect the performance of the transfer lock .",
    "the length of the cavity is actively stabilized to the reference laser frequency using a pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) @xcite sideband locking technique to provide gap - less tuning .",
    "the spectroscopy laser is stabilized to the transfer cavity in a standard pdh configuration .    using an optical frequency comb that is locked to a long - term - stable h - maser",
    ", we show that the resulting frequency stability of the reference and spectroscopy laser is below 50khz on a time scale of several days .",
    "the short term linewidth is measured via a comparison with an ultra - stable laser .",
    "our setup enables us to narrow the linewidth of the spectroscopy laser to well below that of the reference laser , which reduces the requirements for the latter .",
    "we operate the laser system at 882 nm to produce the spectroscopy wavelength of 441 nm for ar@xmath3 after frequency doubling",
    ". however , the ti : sapphire laser can be broadly tuned to access optical transitions in other hcis . the current set of transfer cavity mirrors supports a wide range of wavelengths spanning from @xmath8 nm .",
    "this range can be further extended to other spectroscopy laser wavelengths by adapting the mirror coating .",
    "the experimental setup is schematically shown in fig.[setup ] .",
    "it is divided into three parts : the reference laser , the cavity transfer lock , and the spectroscopy laser , each of which will be discussed in detail in the following .",

    "the output power of @xmath650mw is divided into two parts : 5mw are used to stabilize the frequency to an atomic resonance by modulation transfer spectroscopy ( mts ) @xcite , the remainder is sent through a fiberized electro - optic modulator to provide the modulation for locking the length of the transfer cavity .",

    "it is aligned to counterpropagate along an unmodulated probe beam in a temperature - stabilized rubidium vapor cell .",
    "the laser is subject to dispersion in the rubidium vapor which , around resonance , converts the phase modulation of the pump beam to amplitude modulation .",
    "thus , the saturation of the medium becomes modulated with @xmath12 .",
    "the counterpropagating probe beam experiences a modulated absorption , which is subsequently detected as amplitude modulation on a photo diode .",
    "homodyne mixing of the photo diode signal with @xmath12 yields a dispersion - shaped output signal around the atomic resonance .",
    "this mts signal is tailored by a pi controller and fed back as a modulation of the current via the laser diode driver with a typically achieved feedback bandwidth of 7  khz .",

    "the transitions for @xmath0rb f=3 to f=2,3,4 and @xmath13rb f=2 to f=1,2,3 are shown .",
    "only the cycling transitions f=3 to f=4 ( @xmath0rb ) and f=2 to f=3 ( @xmath13rb ) produce a strong dispersive signal in the modulation transfer spectroscopy .",

    "the advantages of the mts technique for absolute frequency stabilization can be seen in the figure .",

    "in contrast to frequency modulation or polarization spectroscopy @xcite mts is free of a doppler background .",

    "part of the laser power is overlapped with the output of a maser - stabilized optical frequency comb and a beat note is observed on a high bandwidth photo diode and recorded by frequency counters .",
    "we use two independent counters to validate the frequency data .",
    "since the rubidium vapor is enclosed in a fixed volume , any temperature change translates directly into a pressure change .",
    "this not only broadens the transition lines , but also shifts them in energy @xcite . by changing the set - point of the temperature stabilization while observing the beat frequency over time on an electronic counter ,",
    "a temperature sensitivity of @xmath6100khz / k is measured for the transition used here .",
    "the temperature fluctuations of the stabilized cell are @xmath610mk , leading to a frequency instability on the few - khz level .",
    "the differential magnetic field shift of the hyperfine levels used for laser stabilization is 2.3mhz / mt @xcite . with typical magnetic field fluctuations on the order of @xmath14mt and shielding as described above , magnetic field shifts are negligible on the khz level .",
    "the error signal of mts consists of a signal with odd symmetry with respect to the resonance frequency ( originating from phase modulation ) and a signal with even symmetry ( originating from amplitude modulation ) .",
    "residual amplitude modulation ( ram ) at the eom resonance frequency thus introduces an asymmetry in the error signal @xcite .",
    "the effect of varying laser power on the error signal is a linear scaling of the voltage response . for a symmetric error signal",
    "this only affects the slope . for an asymmetric signal , however , the position of the zero - crossing on the frequency axis depends on laser power .",
    "ram - induced asymmetry thus introduces a laser power dependence of the lock point .    in order to study the influence of laser power fluctuations on the laser frequency we vary",

    "the laser frequency responds to a good approximation linearly to a change in laser power ( see fig .  [ pow_sens ] ) . choosing the laser power level for the mts is a tradeoff between a larger error signal for high power and a narrower linewidth for lower power .",
    "the optimum power level is defined by a maximum in the error signal slope .",
    "after determining this optimum power level , a sensitivity for absolute laser frequency shift per unit optical power shift was extracted . with the given laser and rf power",

    "this effect could be further suppressed by active laser power stabilization .    , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the linewidth of the reference laser was estimated through comparison with a stable optical reference .",
    "for this , we stabilized the optical frequency comb to the optical reference @xcite and recorded the spectral distribution of the beat note between the reference laser and the frequency comb with a spectrum analyzer .",
    "this signal is a convolution of the @xmath6100khz broad comb tooth with the reference laser line . from a gaussian fit to the signal we derive an upper bound for the linewidth of the reference laser of 400khz .",

    "each data point is averaged over 30seconds .",
    "the error bars for each measurement are well within the size of the symbol representing it .",

    "fig.[rb_drift ] shows the frequency deviation of the reference laser for each measurement relative to the first measurement . in a time interval of 4  days",
    "the change in frequency is well within a 100khz band , the rms deviation being 20khz . at a wavelength of 780 nm",

    "we employ a cavity spacer made from a 25 mm diameter invar rod with a through hole .",
    "together with a ring piezo attached to one end of the rod , the total cavity length amounts to 100 mm . two curved mirrors with @xmath17 mm are glued to both ends of the spacer , yielding a symmetric cavity with a free spectral range of about 1500mhz .",
    "the length of the cavity was chosen such that higher order modes do not coincide with pdh modulation signals .",
