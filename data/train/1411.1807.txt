    "following a series of papers in 1978 @xcite , it has been widely accepted that drift waves in a plasma in a sheared magnetic field , in the absence of parallel current , temperature gradients , and magnetic curvature , are absolutely stable . in other words ,",
    "the `` universal mode '' driven by the density gradient in slab geometry@xcite becomes absolutely stable if any magnetic shear is included .",
    "this conclusion is important as a basic problem of plasma physics , and for understanding the physical mechanisms underlying instabilities in more complicated configurations in laboratory or space plasmas .",
    "for example , the slab limit can provide insight into the edge of magnetically confined plasmas , in which the slab - like drive from radial equilibrium gradients ( @xmath8 for scale length @xmath9 ) exceeds the curvature drive ( @xmath10 for major radius @xmath11 ) , and in which the temperature gradient may tend to be relatively weaker than the density gradient since the former is more strongly equilibrated over ion orbits @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the 1978 work ( and later studies @xcite ) , here we demonstrate that the universal mode is in fact unstable for a range of perpendicular wavenumbers @xmath3 satisfying @xmath12 , where @xmath2 is the ion gyroradius .",
    "we reach a different conclusion to the 1978 work because these earlier calculations relied on an eigenmode equation derived under the assumption @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the radial scale length of the fluctuating mode in untwisted coordinates .",
    "in contrast , our gyrokinetic approach does not share this limitation .",
    "in slab geometry with magnetic shear , the magnetic field in cartesian coordinates @xmath13 is @xmath14b$ ] for some constant @xmath15 and shear length @xmath6 .",
    "a field - aligned coordinate system is introduced : @xmath16 , so @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we consider electrostatic fluctuations satisfying the standard gyrokinetic orderings @xcite : the gyroradii are of the same formal order as the perpendicular wavelengths of the fluctuations , and these scales are one order smaller than the scale lengths of the equilibrium density and magnetic field .",
    "we therefore may use the linear electrostatic gyrokinetic and quasineutrality equations derived in @xcite , dropping toroidal effects , temperature gradients , and collisions ( except where noted in figure [ fig : tnu ] . ) for perturbations varying in @xmath19 as @xmath20 and independent of @xmath21 , the gyrokinetic equation is @xmath22 and the quasineutrality condition is @xmath23 = 0 .",

    "the frequency satisfies @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the growth rate is smaller in magnitude than the real frequency .",
    "when @xmath74 , instability is found for @xmath75 , extending beyond @xmath76 for the highest values of @xmath77 .",
    "stability for @xmath78 can be understood from the fact that @xmath79 in ( [ eq : gke])-([eq : qn ] ) becomes small , as the gyro - motion averages out very small - scale fluctuations .",
    "stability is the opposite limit of small @xmath3 is expected since refs .",

    "a region of stability also exists around @xmath80 when a realistic mass ratio is used .",
    "no such notch in the growth rate is found when the shear is exactly zero . this abrupt change in eigenvalue when a small change is made to the physical system",
    " in this case the addition of small magnetic shear for @xmath80  is a phenomenon seen in many systems with non - orthogonal eigenmodes @xcite such as this one . for such `` non - normal '' systems ,",
    "the behavior over a finite time is typically a much less sensitive function of parameters than the eigenvalues , which represent behavior for @xmath81 when all points along the field line have had time to communicate .",
    "indeed , in initial - value computations we find no notch near @xmath80 in the growth for short times @xmath82 , before ions have have traveled far enough in @xmath61 to `` realize '' there is shear ; these results will be presented in a separate publication .",
    "instability is found for at least some values of @xmath3 whenever @xmath83 exceeds a critical value of @xmath84 .",

    "@xmath86 is the safety factor , @xmath11 is the major radius , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the minor radius .",
    "the general trend in figure [ fig : landscape ] of decreasing growth rate with increasing shear can be understood from the observation that in the zero - shear limit , instability is found when @xmath89 is below a @xmath90-dependent threshold .",
    "when sufficient shear is included , all of these unstable parallel wavelengths are sufficiently long for there to be a significant increase in @xmath91 , causing @xmath92 to be averaged out by gyroaveraging as discussed above .",
    "for some @xmath38 such as @xmath93 , the growth rate does not increase monotonically with @xmath77 .",
    "this effect is another example of eigenvalues being sensitive and perhaps misleading , typical in non - normal systems @xcite such as this one , for we find the short - time amplification to increase with @xmath77 monotonically .    .",

    "[ fig : landscape],width=336 ]    a typical unstable eigenmode is shown in figure [ fig : eigenmodes ] .",

    "the eigenmode amplitude is small in the inner electron region where @xmath99 .",
    "the electrons are highly nonadiabatic : noting the ratio of electron nonadiabatic / adiabatic terms in ( [ eq : integral ] ) is @xmath100 , then the nonadiabatic electron term exceeds the adiabatic term wherever @xmath101 , everywhere the eigenfunction is significant .    , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ( near the maximum growth rate in figure [ fig : landscape ] ) .",

    "collisions ( using the operator in @xcite ) reduce the growth rate , particularly at the highest @xmath3 values .",
    "this behavior is expected because ( i ) in the free energy moment of ( [ eq : gke ] ) ( eq ( 222 ) of @xcite ) collisions provide an energy sink ; ( ii ) the gyrokinetic collision operator @xcite contains terms @xmath106 ; and ( iii ) the modes at highest @xmath3 have fine velocity - space structure ( as high resolution in energy and pitch - angle is required for numerical convergence ) which collisions destroy . for sufficient collisionality , @xmath107 or more ,",

    "let us now examine in greater detail why we find instability whereas previous authors found stability . first , consider ref .",
    "@xcite , which gave an analytical proof of stability in the limit @xmath109 .",
    "we find no contradiction using gyrokinetic simulations , obtaining instability only when @xmath110 is not small .",
    "( recall @xmath63 for all figures here . )    next , consider refs . @xcite .",
    "these authors considered a differential eigenvalue equation , not equivalent to ( [ eq : integral ] ) , derived assuming @xmath111 ( see e.g. @xcite . )",
    "no such assumption was made in deriving ( [ eq : integral ] ) , which is therefore more general .",
    "considering the typical eigenmode in figure [ fig : eigenmodes].b , there is structure on scales smaller than @xmath2 , violating ( [ eq : differentiallimit ] ) .",
    "therefore the approach used in refs .",
    "@xcite is inapplicable for the modes that are unstable .",
    "@xcite claims to give a proof of stability which does not rely on ( [ eq : differentiallimit ] ) .",
    "however , this reference uses an integral eigenmode equation which differs from ( [ eq : integral ] ) , so it is not surprising that we reach different conclusions .",
    "the eigenmode equation in @xcite is effectively a wkb approximation , the zero - shear dispersion relation but with @xmath112 replaced by @xmath113 .",
    "this wkb approximation is not justified for modes such as the one in figure [ fig : eigenmodes ] , in which the wavelengths in @xmath21 are comparable to or much longer than the scale of variation in the ion and electron @xmath58 functions .",
    "the problems with the integral equation in @xcite are discussed in the introduction of @xcite and references therein .",
    "ref @xcite appears to give a proof of stability using the full gyrokinetic integral eigenmode equation ( [ eq : integral ] ) .",
    "although we retain @xmath114 for all numerical results shown here while @xmath114 is set to 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite , this difference is unimportant : we find little change in the instability for @xmath115 if @xmath114 is set to 1 in gs2 .",
    "the proof in @xcite is accomplished by multiplying the electron nonadiabatic term in ( [ eq : integral ] ) ( @xmath116 ) by a parameter @xmath117 .",
    "the authors first prove stability in the adiabatic electron limit @xmath118 .",
    "we do not disagree , as we find no instability numerically with adiabatic electrons .",
    "however we do disagree with the final step of the proof , where it is argued that solutions for @xmath119 can not cross the real axis as @xmath117 is increased from 0 to 1 to recover ( [ eq : integral ] ) .",
    "including @xmath117 in gs2 , we find that modes do continuously transform from damped to unstable as @xmath117 is increased from 0 to 1 . for the case @xmath105 and @xmath120 shown in figure [ fig : eigenmodes ] , marginal stability occurs when @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the problematic step in @xcite is item ( iii ) on p750 . indeed , when @xmath122 , a nonadiabatic electron term must be included in ( 38)-(55 ) , and this term can have opposite sign to the other terms in ( 55 ) , so ( 56 ) no longer follows .",
    "in summary , we find the plasma slab with weak or moderate magnetic shear ( @xmath123 ) is generally unstable at low collisionality , even when temperature gradients are weak . the density - gradient - driven electron drift wave , known to be absolutely unstable in the absence of magnetic shear @xcite , is not stabilized at all wavelengths when small magnetic shear is introduced , counter to previous findings .",
    "this instability is seen robustly in multiple gyrokinetic codes , and occurs for @xmath124 .",
    "previous work that apparently showed stability of the universal mode @xcite assumed either ( [ eq : differentiallimit ] ) or @xmath109 , whereas we make neither assumption . ref . @xcite employed a less accurate dispersion relation , and @xcite appears incorrect for nonadiabatic electrons .",
    "though it has sometimes been assumed that an electrostatic instability seen in a gyrokinetic simulation propagating in the electron diamagnetic direction must be a trapped electron mode or electron temperature gradient mode , our results indicate neither trapped particles nor temperature gradients are necessary for instability in this phase - velocity direction .",
    "as the universal mode can indeed be absolutely unstable in the presence of magnetic shear , it should be considered alongside temperature - gradient - driven modes , trapped particle instabilities , ballooning modes , and tearing modes as one of the fundamental plasma microinstabilities .",
