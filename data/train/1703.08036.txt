    "consider a quantum mechanical system consisting of two entangled photons .",
    "one photon of each pair is detected on the ground while the other is sent to the international space station ( iss ) .",
    "different theoretical models have been proposed to analyze this scenario with widely varying results .",
    "for example , one possible approach would be to place the system on a curved background metric and quantise the field over the set of modes formed by the geodesics on the metric . thus taking into account the differences in expected arrival times ( due to path lengths , turbulence , time - dilation , clock drifts , etc . ) .",
    "standard quantum mechanics ( qm ) predicts no additional decoherence due to the difference in gravitational curvature between the two photon paths .",
    "such an approach , however , breaks down in the presence of exotic gravitational fields with non - hyperbolic metrics .",
    "so one requires new models to deal with these types of space - time curvatures .",
    "another analysis using quantum field theory in curved space - time shows that a single - photon wave - packet undergoes not only a doppler frequency shift , but also the broadening of the mode profile .",
    "this broadening occurs because the propagation through curved space - time induces an effective change in refractive index that shifts excitations to other frequency modes  @xcite .",
    "there have also been different predictions for a gravitationally induced decoherence effect .",
    "reference  @xcite shows that a decoherence effect is produced by the shifting and the flattening of the wavepacket s frequency distribution . in this derivation",
    ", no particle creation was assumed to happen .",
    "thus , it is possible , in principle , to recover the information that has been lost by adjusting the detector to correct the gravitationally induced effects . in contrast , the model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite predicts an irrecoverable gravitational decoherence effect due to a speculative nonlinear back - action of the metric on the quantum fields that leads to particle loss into a causally disconnected region of space - time .",
    "furthermore , refs .",
    "@xcite show that this type of decoherence effect is seen only by entangled systems ( i.e. ,  classical correlations are not affected ) .",
    "uniquely , the predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite , referred to as the event operator formalism , can be experimentally verified with current technology , providing a rare opportunity to test models of fundamental qm and general relativity simultaneously .",
    "we present ( in section  [ sec : theory ] ) an extension of the theoretical framework behind the mission , to address practical concerns including losses and the need for space - like separation of detection events .",
    "we also show that certain types of entangled quantum systems / states show a more pronounced decoherence effect and study the feasibility of a simple , low - cost space - based mission to search for decoherence in quantum systems due to gravity ( section  [ sec : feas ] ) . in section  [ sec : expt ] we present a minimalistic experimental design which utilizes several resources already on board the iss .",
    "further , the same apparatus can be used for many other far - reaching quantum experiments including long distance bell tests , a variety of earth - to - space quantum communication protocols ,  @xcite .",
    "the same flight hardware can also be used for classical communication research ; for example , the precise time tags can be used for very high order ( @xmath02048 ) pulse position modulation ( ppm )  @xcite , while the polarization channels can be used for multiple input multiple output transmit diversity  @xcite .    the experiment scientific requirement ( esr )",
    "document was submitted to the european space agency ( esa ) at the conclusion of the phase - a study .",
    "the esr defines the scientific objectives and derives from them the requirements driving the mission design , while this manuscript furthers the underlying science as well as details the feasibility study and one recommended implementation on the iss .",
    "the event operator formalism is a non - linear extension to standard relativistic quantum field theory . building upon the underlying theory presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , we present a detailed , case by case analysis of the model addressing the practical implementations to support a complete feasibility study . to facilitate this",
    "we introduce an effective theory , applicable under the conditions of the proposed experiment .",
    "consider an initial two - mode gaussian state @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 label the modes ) generated by the source on the ground .",
    "mode @xmath3 is sent into space and detected on the iss , while mode @xmath4 is detected on earth at some small spacio - temporal displacement to ensure that the two detection events are space - like separated . under these conditions",
    "the event operator formalism can be represented by a map @xmath5 , between input @xmath6 and final states @xmath7 : @xmath8 .",
    "unlike typical quantum channels , which are _ linear _ completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) maps , the event operator channel @xmath5 is a fundamentally _ non - linear _ cptp map .",
    "the map @xmath5 is equivalent to a displacement @xmath9 followed by a beamsplitter with reflectivity @xmath10 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ec ] ) , where @xmath11 depends on the initial displacement @xmath12 of mode 1 , and where @xmath10 equals the `` event overlap '' .",
    "the event overlap depends on the properties of the source mode , the intrinsic resolution of the detectors and the properties of the space - time along the optical paths .",

    "below , we give an expression for @xmath10 relevant for the proposed experiment .",
    "acting on the mode 1 as it travels through curved space - time .",
    "this map is equivalent to a displacement followed by a beamsplitter as depicted in the lower diagram .",
    "it is nonlinear because @xmath13 depend on the initial state , and because the initial state has to be `` copied '' to modes @xmath14 , which violates the no - cloning theorem . in this diagram , there are two copies of the state @xmath15 ; one acts on the modes @xmath2 and the other acts on the modes @xmath14 . ]",
    "we can use the equivalent optical circuit of fig .",

    "the decoherence effect of gravity on mode @xmath3 is modelled by coupling it to its twin mode @xmath17 via the beamsplitter @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath18 are photon creation operators for these modes , the beamsplitter evolution is given by a unitary @xmath19 according to @xmath20 the state experiences a displacement @xmath9 if @xmath21 is nontrivial , and evolves through the beamsplitter @xmath5 using eq .  .",

    ", we apply @xmath19 to @xmath28 to obtain : @xmath29 finally , by performing a partial trace over modes 3 and 4 we arrive at the final state @xmath30 to measure the coincidences , we apply the projector : @xmath31 which represents a coincidence measurement by ideal detectors that are frequency insensitive . by decomposing the mode operators into their spectral components we obtain @xmath32 , which is precisely the event operator prediction ( compare to eq .",

    "hence the effect does not affect the singles counts .",
    "the experimental implementation proposed here will only measure the decoherence of a time energy entangled state in the arrival time basis .",
    "thus , the gravitationally induced decoherence can only be observed ( with this experiment ) as a decorrelation in the arrival times .",
    "a lossy channel can be modeled by a beamsplitter interacting with the vacuum state , whose transmission coefficient @xmath36 equals the transmittivity of the channel  @xcite . applying losses @xmath37 to modes @xmath2 results in the modified input state : @xmath38 after evolving through the @xmath10 beamsplitter , any further losses to mode @xmath3 is just another added factor that can be absorbed into @xmath39 . the overall effect is just to transform @xmath40 .",
    "this results in the coincidence rate : @xmath41 in addition , since dark counts happen at the detectors , they wo nt change the factor @xmath10 .",
    "equation  [ pulse ] describes a pulsed source producing spectrally uncorrelated photons , i.e. ,  the joint spectral amplitude for the source is separable , to first - order in @xmath42 .",

    ". we can represent the initial state in this situation by @xmath43 where , now the joint spectral amplitude ",
    "h(k ) is strongly correlated . following the same procedure as before ,",
    "i.e. ,  copying the state onto ancilla modes , interacting with the beamsplitter , tracing out the ancilla modes and modelling detection with a broadband detector , produces the same result as before , eq .",
    "[ eq : loss ] .",
    "suppose the initial state contains only classical correlations , in the form of two coherent states : @xmath44 .",
    "now , the event operator map will apply a non - trivial displacement @xmath45 .",
    "after copying the state to modes @xmath14 we obtain the following evolution : @xmath46    after tracing out modes @xmath14 we are left with the same state we started with .",
    "this is just a special instance of the more general feature that classical correlations are preserved by the event operator formalism .",
    "thus this theory predicts no decoherence with faint coherent pulses obtained , for instance , by attenuating a laser .    for non - gaussian states ( e.g. ,  classically correlated single - photons or photons from a deterministic single - photon source ) , the circuit of fig .  [ fig : ec ] fails to agree with the predictions of the event formalism , and it remains an open problem to find an accurate circuit that applies to these states . in this case",
    ", calculations performed directly in the event formalism confirm that classical correlations experience no gravitational decoherence ( or decorrelation ) effect in general .",
    "the de - correlation of entanglement due to event operators is not restricted to time - energy entanglement  in principle it applies to any kind of entanglement .",
    "let us consider the case of polarization entanglement with an initial state : @xmath47 using the notation e.g. ,  @xmath48 .",

    "coincidences in which the photons have different polarizations do occur , but only with probability @xmath51 , making these events negligible .",
    "so we can not practically measure the de - correlation of polarization entanglement .",
    "experimentally we are most interested in the case of the cw , time energy entangled spdc .",
    "the event overlap for this case can be calculated using the methods described in refs .",
    "if we assume that the spectral amplitude @xmath52 is gaussian , we obtain : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the dimensionless ratio of the gravitational time - dilation , @xmath55 , to the photon coherence time , @xmath56 .",
    "the photon coherence time is the temporal standard deviation of @xmath57 , where @xmath57 is the fourier transform of the joint spectral amplitude  @xmath52 , which is assumed to be a gaussian .",
    "the gravitational time - dilation is the difference , @xmath58 , between the propagation times of the photons sent to the iss as measured by local observers along the path , @xmath59 , and a global observer situated far from the gravitating body @xmath60 .",
    "we find @xmath61 where @xmath62 is earth radius , @xmath63 is the iss height , @xmath64 is the mass of the earth expressed in units of length and @xmath65 is the angle from the zenith .",
    "this result is obtained assuming @xmath66 .",
    "if we further assume @xmath67 and consider the result at the zenith ( @xmath68 ) we obtain @xmath69 , in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite .       at this juncture",
    ", we address an ambiguity in the formalism that has its roots in the long - standing measurement problem in quantum mechanics .",
    "what happens to the state from eq .   after a photon is detected in mode @xmath4",
    "for all practical purposes , the state is said to have  collapsed \" , resulting in a two - photon state ( actually a one - photon state if the measurement is destructive , as it is here ) .",
    "however , different interpretations disagree about whether this apparent collapse is a physical process , or merely illusory .",
    "according to the many - worlds interpretation , for instance , there exists another branch of the wavefunction in which a photon was not detected in mode @xmath4 , and hence the state is still vacuum in that branch .",
    "the total state is therefore expressed as an entangled state that includes the environment , containing the detector and the scientists observing the outcome :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 indicates a quantum state of the environment in which no photon was detected and recorded by experimenters , while @xmath72 indicates that a photon was detected in mode @xmath4 and recorded .",
    "this state is still a superposition of the vacuum and two - photon state for modes @xmath2 , so it is still entangled in photon number .",
    "the event operator model therefore predicts a drop in coincidence counts due to the decorrelation of this entanglement . on the other hand , according to an objective collapse interpretation , the state after measurement of mode @xmath4 should be just the two - photon state :    @xmath73    this state could still be entangled in its internal degrees of freedom ( such as polarization ) but it is clearly not entangled in photon number and hence the event operator model does not imply any loss of coincidences .",
    "we therefore face a dilemma : the predictions of the event operator model seem to depend on whether one uses a many - worlds or an objective collapse version of the model !     luckily , there is a very simple argument that shows that the objective - collapse version of the model must give the same predictions as the many - worlds version , in the special case of an experiment in which the heralding event ( on earth ) is measured at space - like separation from the detection event ( at the iss ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cones ] .",
    "the argument rests upon the empirical principle that no signals can be sent faster than light . assuming that objective collapse interpretations must adhere to this principle ,",
    "the objective collapse of the wave - function due to the detection of a photon in mode @xmath4 , despite being instantaneous , can not change the model s predictions from what they would have been if the two modes had still been entangled in photon number .",
    "if any such difference were permitted , it could be exploited to send a signal between space - like separated events , violating the no - signaling principle .",
    "( as an example of such a protocol , consider a state having photon number entanglement between three modes .",
    "the first mode is used to either collapse or not collapse the whole state , while the remaining two modes are used to check for the presence or absence of photon number correlations at a space - like separation ) .",
    "non - signalling non - linear theories of this type were described by kent in refs .",
    "the above argument shows that , in order to be consistent with the no - signaling principle , both versions of the event - operator model ( the many - worlds version , and the ` kent ' version ) must predict a visible loss of coincidences when the detection events are space - like separated . hence , space - like separation is necessary to conclusively test both variants of the model .",
    "we note that the kent version of the model  @xcite is also important to test because it has some advantages over the many - worlds variant .",
    "in particular , the many - worlds variant suffers from one aspect of the ` preparation problem '  @xcite for non - linear theories , in that it does not make clear how to produce pure states operationally .",
    "by constrast , the kent version of the model allows pure states to be created by measurement and post - selection , via an objective collapse of the wavefunction .    typically in qm a measurement",
    "is considered finished when the measurement has been stored as classical information that the quantum system can no longer affect .. this process takes a certain amount of time , typically on the order of 100  200 ns .",
    "thus on the ground the only delay needed is about 200 m of optical fibre to obtain a delay of @xmath01@xmath74s .     or",
    "@xmath75 ( events @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) while the other ( mode 1 ) is sent to space and detected at time @xmath78 ( event @xmath79 ) .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the path that would be taken by light traveling in a vacuum . as a result ,",
    "the detection event @xmath76 is in the causal past of @xmath79 , while event @xmath77 is causally separated from @xmath79 .",
    "if the event operator model is modified to take into account the proposal of kent  @xcite , then only photons detected at events @xmath77 and @xmath79 will experience gravitational decoherence . ]",
    "other than this small distance necessary to space - like separate the detection events , no other delay is needed .",
    "let us consider an additional delay @xmath80 which is beyond that necessary for the aforementioned space - like separation . to see why @xmath80 does not play a role in the effect , we introduce @xmath80 to the case discussed in section  [ sec : timeent ] .",
    "this is done by applying the unitary @xmath81 . since it commutes with the beamsplitter and displacement of @xmath5 ( which do nt act on mode 2 ) , the state of all modes before detection is just : @xmath82 the projector @xmath83 is not sensitive to this phase shift , since : @xmath84 hence the expectation value is unaffected .    we emphasize that although the detection events need to be space - like separated , we do not need to make a fast basis choice as in a loophole free bell experiment .",
    "we measure the decoherence effect by measuring in fixed measurement bases and looking at the change in correlations between measurement outcomes .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] as well as previous works  @xcite predict an unusual and unexpected behavior of some systems . these predictions challenge standard quantum theory and pose interesting interpretations to relativity .",
    "therefore it becomes very important to experimentally verify these effects .",
    "a successful detection of gravitational decoherence would have far reaching consequences for relativistic qm . on the contrary , proving the absence of ( or experimentally imposing more stringent limits to ) this decoherence effect can be used to test between several models in general relativity .    the mission needs to provide scientifically rigorous and meaningful results and be practically possible . in this section",
    "we evaluate the feasibility of testing the above theory using a very simple single - photon detection module on board the iss . in general",
    ", we show the feasibility in a worst case scenario , i.e. ,  we choose the worst alternatives / set of parameters that we can reasonably expect and for which the experiment remains possible .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] shows that the effect is only present when using entangled states , further time - energy entanglement would produce a large observable effect unlike polarization entanglement .",
    "we have also demonstrated that to observe the effect it is sufficient to measure the decorrelation in one specific fixed measurement basis .",
    "consider a time - energy entangled state produced from a spdc source ( section  [ sec : timeent ] ) .",
    "the effect is observable as a reduction in the coincidence rate ( @xmath85 ) without a reduction in the singles rates ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "we define the heralding efficiency as @xmath88 . from eq .",
    "[ eq : loss ] , we observe that the change in heralding efficiency @xmath89 due to gravitational decoherence is given by the decoherence factor ( @xmath90 ) defined as @xmath91 . consequently ,",
    "if @xmath92 is the heralding efficiency in the absence of any decoherence , the efficiency with the effect ( @xmath93 ) is given by : @xmath94 this decoherence factor ( @xmath95 ) is the same as @xmath96 in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath97 experimentally , pairs ( coincidences ) are identified based on their individual arrival times  @xcite as recorded by independent time tagging modules .",
    "typically , a cross correlation histogram ( @xmath98 ) of these arrival times is used to identify coincidences .",
    "the width of the @xmath98 peak is limited by the detector jitter , while accidental coincidences ( noise ) prevent the @xmath98 outside the peak from falling to zero .",
    "figure  [ fig : g2 ] shows the expected change in the @xmath98 histogram with and without the gravitational decoherence effect .",
    "photon pairs that undergo gravitational decoherence lose correlation in their arrival times and ( if not lost ) are detected only as singles .",
    "thus , in the @xmath98 histogram , they contribute only to the offset from zero .",
    "however , since the decohered pairs can contribute evenly to one of several time bins , the contribution to any one bin and thus to the offset is negligible in practice .     between the arrival times of photons at the ogs and on the iss .",
    "the area of the peak represents the number of photon pairs while the number of singles events is obtained from the photon counting module . the gravitational decoherence effect from ref .",
    "@xcite , should result in a decrease in the number of photon pairs ( area ) without altering the singles rate , the position of or the width of the peak .",
    "this is depicted in the above figure where the red ( solid ) curve shows the @xmath98 in the absence of a gravitational field gradient ( i.e. ,  without gravitational decoherence effect ) and the blue ( dashed ) curve shows the effect of gravitational decoherence between an ogs and the iss at the zenith 400 km away using a source of time entangled photon pairs with a coherence time of 0.8ps .",
    "the offset shown here is grossly exaggerated and for illustrative purposes only .",
    "therefore , to observe the gravitational decoherence effect we can not rely on measuring the change in noise / background accidental count rates , instead we rely on measuring the change in area between the two curves .",
    "we emphasise that the gravitational decoherence effect can still be observed despite a detector jitter of several ns . reducing the jitter only improves the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) by reducing the accidental coincidence rate ( which contributes to the offset ) .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] ]      we measure the decoherence of the time energy entangled photon pair by observing only in one degree of freedom  the arrival time of each individual photon . measuring in an energy degree of freedom would require a significantly more complex experiment .",
    "thus , we can only observe what will appear to be a decorrelation effect .",
    "the largest challenge of this experiment is to distinguish the decorrelation from losses and background noise .",
    "we plan to achieve this through a combination of _ four _ different measurements out of which three depend on the functional dependence of @xmath90 with three different parameters and the last relies on comparison to a classical system that does not undergo decoherence .",
    "consider eq .",
    ", @xmath90 depends on two factors we can change during an experiment : the gravitational time dilation @xmath55 depends on two parameters  the distance between the optical ground station ( ogs ) and the iss as well as the total gravitational potential difference . from the perspective of an observer on the ground these parameters can be expressed in terms of the zenith angle @xmath65 ( i.e. ,  the angle  subtended by the iss with the observer s zenith ) and the orbital altitude @xmath63 .",
    "further , @xmath90 depends strongly on the coherence time ( @xmath56 ) of the photons .",
    "lastly , section  [ sec : coherentstates ] predicts that @xmath99 for a non - entangled faint pulse source ( fps ) ; thus by comparing photons from a fps and an entangled photon pair source ( epps ) we could detect the presence of gravitational decoherence .",
    "the decoherence effect as quantified by @xmath90 is dependent on the coherence time of the photons used as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coherencetime ] .",
    "experimentally , varying the coherence time in the approximate range of 0.8ps to 3ps ( i.e. ,  @xmath02 nm to 0.5 nm bandwidth at 830 nm ) can be easily achieved by using a few different spectral filters .",
    "we recommend using this range as a good compromise between the increase in losses due to dispersion in the atmosphere , the strength of the effect , and the brightness of the source .    ) as a function of the photon coherence time for two different orbital heights of the iss .",
    "@xcite predicts that the dechoherence effect will be more pronounced for entangled photon pairs where the signal and idler modes have a large bandwidth ( corresponding to a short coherence time ) .",
    "[ fig : coherencetime ] ]      by varying the orbital altitude of the iss , we predict a large and measurable change in @xmath90 as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : height ] .",
    "boosters on the iss are used to control this orbital altitude .",
    "currently the perigee altitude is maintained at 400 @xmath100 2 km .",
    "however this was not always so : in the years 1999 to 2009 the orbital altitude of the iss underwent changes from @xmath0340 to 400 km at rates of more than 40km / year .",

    "these calculations were made according to ref .",
    "@xcite for the case when the iss is at the zenith of the ogs .",

    "this height difference is clearly insufficient to measure a significant change in @xmath90 .",
    "further , to exploit the ellipticity of the orbit would require the iss to have both its apogee and perigee at the zenith of the ogs . even in this case , weather conditions and a limited mission lifetime ( to further reduce costs ) could hinder this measurement .",
    "still , we believe this is important to consider the possibilities of performing such measurements on the iss , or if unfeasible there , in future missions .",
    "most passes of the iss over a given ogs will be at some angle @xmath65 away from the zenith ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "this zenith angle also affects @xmath90 and must be taken into account ( fig .",

    "[ fig : angle ] ]      the previous three subsections have dealt with the characteristic ways in which @xmath90 changes when we change an experimentally controllable parameter . another way to test the presence of gravitational decoherence of a quantum entangled system is to send an otherwise identical non - entangled photon along with one photon from an entangled pair and observe the difference between these two types of systems . a fps with exactly the same wavelength as the epps can be used as an experimental control .",
    "the pulse width can be adjusted to produce attenuated single - photon states with exactly the same coherence times ( for 830 nm this corresponds to pulse widths of @xmath0340fs to 2ps ) . by rapidly multiplexing photons from a fps and an epps on a time scale much faster than the atmospheric turbulence",
    ", we can ensure a direct comparison . naturally , to minimize error bars",
    "we must have high count rates , and the next section addresses this problem .",
    "to show the feasibility of the experiment we must focus on three aspects : the losses , the error bars due to counting statistics and the ability / sensitivity to perform the measurement despite the motion of the iss .",
    "losses in a free space uplink to the iss are attributed to several different factors  absorption and scattering in the atmosphere , clipping losses due to a limited sending and receiving telescope apertures ( the divergence of the beam due to diffraction limits and dispersion in the atmosphere further contributes to this loss ) , beam wander and pointing accuracy that also cause clipping , limited detection efficiency , and limited transmission through the sending and receiving optics and telescopes .",

    "the fried parameter @xmath107 ( an indication of the size of pockets of turbulence in the atmosphere ) can be used to determine the optimal sending telescope diameter for the smallest spot size at the iss . for a typical ogs at tenerife ( say )",

    "considering telescope imperfections , we expect a final beam diameter of @xmath03 m . to make a conservative worst case estimate let us consider a beam diameter of 4.5 m .    on board the iss we have a choice of receiving telescopes  a  nikon af - s nikkor 400 mm \" photographer s telephoto lens with a clear aperture of 13 cm mounted in the cupola window , and a 23.5 cm astronomical telescope ( celestron cpc 925 ) mounted in the window observational research facility ( worf ) window ( part of the  iserv \" mission ) .",

    "for now we plan on using the 24 cm telescope which gives us a clipping loss of between 26 to 28db ( calculated assuming a gaussian beam profile ) .",
    "third , let us consider the beam wander loss which is limited by the pointing accuracy of the sending telescope ( the receiving telescope can use fast mirrors to track the ground beacon ) .",
    "the pointing error of the ogs is measured against the position of a distant star and includes the atmospheric seeing ( turbulence ) effects and mechanical alignment .",
    "for example , the ogs at tenerife has a minimum pointing error of 1.45@xmath74rad ( with a fine adjustment mirror installed )  @xcite , thus it is reasonable to expect the pointing accuracy for other similar ogss to be @xmath1105@xmath74rad .",
    "due to the fast motion of the iss ( up to @xmath01.1@xmath103/s ) , we must also consider about 5@xmath74rad of additional error in the point ahead angle .",

    "however , atmospheric turbulence influences both the signal count rate and the background count rate simultaneously thus averaging or accumulating statistics over long periods can not reduce the error due to background count fluctuations . for a successful experiment we must identify the heralding efficiency change despite these fluctuations .",

    "we can rapidly alternate between sending photons from the fps and from the epps on the time scale of @xmath0100@xmath74s .",

    "scaling it is very important to maximize the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) in the experiment . in low earth orbit ( leo )",

    "operating at night while the iss is within the earth s shadow and the moon is in a favorable position is essential to avoiding direct and reflected sunlight .",
    "strong spectral filtering , shielding ( optical and radiation ) , a small field of view and complete darkness surrounding the ogs can further reduce the background counts . by waiting for good weather conditions ( i.e. ,  clear skies and @xmath115 which is equivalent to a fried parameter @xmath116 cm ) we can further reduce the effect of background counts . for high altitude observatories like those at tenerife",
    "such suitable conditions occur 20 to 35% of the time .",
    "let us consider the change in the heralding efficiency due to the motion of the iss from the zenith ( @xmath101 ) towards the horizon ( @xmath117 ) of the ogs .",
    "there are two main contributors to the change in the heralding efficiency : the change in losses ( fig .",

    "@xcite for photons from the epps .",
    "the error bars represent 1 standard error in measuring the heralding efficiency using lnd .",
    "the figure was computed using the worst case losses ( 46db ) and noise rates ( 6000/s for each of the 2 space - based detectors of which 100counts / s are assumed to be due to intrinsic dark counts with a poissonian distribution while the remaining 5900 background counts / s are assumed to have a lnd .",
    "we assume 200000counts / s ( with a poissonian distribution ) divided among all detectors / pixels on the ground .",
    "we assume that both the fps and epps each emit 350@xmath11810@xmath119photons / s towards the space segment .",
    "the eeps is assumed to have a 20% intrinsic heralding efficiency .",
    "thus on board the iss we approximately expect 2650pairs / s and 19500singles / s inclusive of accidentals and noise counts most of which follow a lnd .    the extent / strength of gravitational decoherence ( if any ) can be found by fitting the experimental data to either the gray or the orange curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : efferr ] . to observe the decoherence effect",
    "it is sufficient to be able to differentiate between these two curves , which is still possible despite the significantly larger error bars of the lnd .",
    "the curves shown here are for an orbital altitude of 400 km .",
    "the atmospheric transmission losses are roughly the same for orbital altitudes between 300 to 500 km",
    ". only losses due to clipping change significantly , thus similar curves for different orbital altitudes will be parallel to each other .    thus far in this subsection",
    ", we have considered distinguishing the gravitational decoherence from losses and drastic / worst case fluctuations in background count rates at the level of one standard error .",
    "we note that the other methods of detecting gravitational decoherence discussed in this manuscript ( such as , the strong variation with the coherence length of the photon pairs ) are statically more rigorous and can lead to identifying the presence or absence of the gravitational decoherence by 6 or more standard errors .",
    "further , measurements under more favourable weather conditions ( @xmath115 ) or with lower noise count rates would also increase the statistical significance of the results .",
    "thus , scientifically meaningful conclusions can be drawn form the mission despite the limited statistical significance of one type of measurement . nonetheless , designing the mission to ensure a statistical significance of 6 standard errors for the measurement described in this subsection would prohibitively increase the cost of the mission .    ]",
    "the dependence of @xmath90 on coherence time , orbital altitude and zenith angle @xmath65 can be calculated theoretically and is shown in figs .",

    "[ fig : pvsnoise ] ]    out of the 4 measurements we can perform to verify the decoherence effect , @xmath90 is least sensitive to changes in the zenith angle @xmath65 specially near 0@xmath103 . nevertheless , we can show that even this measurement is feasible despite the large and worst case background count rates and fluctuations .",
    "so far there have been no measurements of the background count rates we can expect using single - photon detectors in space with a narrow field of view .",
    "this makes it very difficult to estimate the background count rates we will observe in the final experiment .",
    "our best estimates predict between 1000 to 5000 counts per second .",
    "the maximum field of view ( mfov ) of the telescope through the worf window on the iss depends on the details of how it is mounted and how much room there is for the telescope to move . in the worst case",
    "the mfov is limited to 45@xmath103 .",
    "thus the maximum observable change in @xmath90 is from a zenith angle @xmath65 of 0@xmath103 to 22.5@xmath103 . here",
    "@xmath120 is 0.051 or approximately 5% ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : angle ] ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pvsnoise ] we can tolerate up to 6000 noise counts per second and still be able to resolve this change .",
    "we emphasize that this is only a worst case estimate and the actual experiment can be expected to be much more sensitive because only a small fraction of the background light will follow a lnd due to atmospheric turbulence as we expect the largest contribution to be light reflected from clouds , the upper atmosphere , or the iss itself .",
    "similarly a 5% @xmath120 can be obtained by changing the coherence time from 0.8ps to 0.864ps which corresponds to a decrease in the bandwidth by 0.14 nm .",
    "it can also be obtained by varying the orbital altitude of the iss by @xmath031 km thus in the worst case ( i.e. ,  with a noise count rate of 2000/s for each of the two iss based detectors ) , we will be able to detect the effect if we were to change the bandwidth by about 0.16 nm , the altitude by @xmath031 km , or the zenith angle @xmath65 by 22.5@xmath103 .    the sensitivity of our measurements to a change in @xmath90 is strongly dependent on the noise count rate(as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : pvsnoise ] ) . consequently decreasing the noise count rate to 950/s on each detector",
    "allows us to be sensitive to a change in @xmath90 of 2.5% .",
    "thus the smallest change in orbital height that could be used to detect the decoherence effect is about 15 km .",
    "obtained when the orbital altitude changes from 400 to 415 km at the zenith of the ogs when using a coherence time of 0.8ps ( see fig  [ fig : height ] ) .",
    "similarly , the smallest change in bandwidth that results in the smallest measurable change in @xmath90 of 2.5% is about 0.08 nm , obtained by changing the coherence time from 0.8 to 0.84ps at an orbital altitude of 400 km and at the zenith of the ogs .    we can clearly see that the best possible measurements of @xmath90 are to study the variation with coherence time ( due to its sensitivity ) and to make a comparison of the epps with a fps .",

    "we can divide each experiment into several integration time windows of say 1s each , during which calibration measurements are followed by the quantum experiment .",
    "we suggest the following utilization pattern for each integration time window :    * 5% for measuring the intrinsic dark counts of the detectors by using a shutter to block all incident light . *",

    "all of these requirements can be accomplished with existing technology .",
    "the biggest challenge is the production of a few hundred million photon pairs per second .",
    "we currently have a type 0 periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) based source capable of producing 8@xmath123photon pairs / s / mw of pump power .",
    "increasing the pump power would in principle allow us to generate at the required pair rates . the ground based detectors should be capable of detecting a singles rate of @xmath124photons / s .",

    "qm , being a _ linear _ theory , predicts the absence of any gravitational decoherence in the proposed experiment .",
    "consequently , if an effect was observed this would be a monumental achievement that would overturn the traditional view about how quantum matter interacts with the gravitational field .",
    "nevertheless , should our experiment fail to detect gravitational decoherence , a first upper bound will be established in a benchmark experiment .",
    "this limit will provide direct experimental evidence to bound the possible non - linearity of qm in the presence of gravity , and allow us to place bounds on the maximum decoherence predicted by various models of gravitationally - induced decoherence .",
    "the absence of decoherence in this experiment would suggest that qm should not be modified in order to conform to the predictions of classical general relativity .",
    "one motivation for the event - operator model is consistency with non - hyperbolic space - times such as closed time - like curves .",
    "thus a plausible conclusion in this case is that general relativity ( gr ) has to be modified to accommodate ( linear ) qm , in one of the following possible ways :    1 .",
    "it may be that the non - linearity only manifests in cases where the local curvature is due to the presence of a closed time - like curve ( ctc ) somewhere in space - time ( and not due to , e.g. ,  a massive planet ) .",
    "however , this would imply that local physics can depend on the global topology of space - time , in violation of the equivalence principle .",
    "2 .   physical laws ( such as unknown quantum gravity effects )",
    "might prevent ctcs from existing at all , which would remove the motivation for the non - linear model considered here .",
    "however , since ctcs are a direct prediction of gr , this option would clearly require a modification of gr .",
    "3 .   it may be that ctcs can exist , and their nonlinear effects can be observed in general curved space - times , but that the nonlinearity is described by a model other than the event - operator model , for example a field theory extension of post - selected closed time - like curves ( p - ctcs ) along the lines of the path integral approaches discussed in refs .  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the experiment would place bounds on the size of this non - linearity .",
    "4 .   finally , it could be that the event - operator model is correct , but decoherence is not observed because all correlations are fundamentally classical ( i.e. ,  entanglement is really the result of a classical realistic hidden - variable theory ) . due to bell13s theorem",
    ", this would imply reality is non - local , which is arguably contrary to the local structure of gr .",
    "the only one of the above options that does not immediately require a modification of gr is option ( 3 ) .",
    "however , there is evidence that p - ctcs and possibly other ctc models would imply the ability to signal information between events that are not causally connected in the space - time metric , also violating a basic principle of gr .",
    "although it might be possible to find a model that does not have this pathological feature , nobody has yet seen how to achieve this despite much effort , making it unlikely to be the case .",
    "thus , the significance of the experiment can be summarized as deciding whether qm becomes non - linear in the presence of gravity ( in which case decoherence is predicted ) , or whether the theory of gr will ultimately need to be changed in order to allow for the linearity of qm ( if entanglement is seen to be preserved ) .    to have a scientific payload outside",
