    "such flavor @xmath0 symmetries can be naturally identified with the anomalous @xmath10 symmetry of string theory @xcite .",

    "we will assume in the present work a universal susy breaking spectrum that is also @xmath13invariant so that excessive edms are not induced from the fundamental soft susy breaking parameters .",

    "<S> we show that in supersymmetric models with a gauged flavor symmetry explaining the hierarchy of fermion masses and mixings , the electron , muon , neutron and the deuteron acquire sizable electric dipole moments ( edm ) through loop diagrams involving the flavor gaugino / gauge boson near the planck scale . </S>",
    "<S> these edms are proportional to the phases in the fermion yukawa couplings and are typically much larger than the neutrino seesaw induced edm for the leptons . in a popular class of models based on anomalous @xmath0 flavor symmetry of string origin , we find @xmath1 cm , @xmath2 cm , @xmath3 cm , and @xmath4 cm , which are within reach of next generation experiments .    </S>",
