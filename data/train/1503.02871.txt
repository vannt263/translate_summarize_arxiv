    "some strange baryons experimental information on their binding in nuclei exists , information on antibaryons in nuclei are rather scarce . only for the antiproton",
    "the nuclear potential could be constrained by experimental studies .",
    "the ( schrdinger equivalent ) antiproton potential at normal nuclear density turns out to be in the range of @xmath3mev , i.e. a factor of approximately 4 weaker than expected from naive g - parity relations @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that this discrepancy can be traced back to the missing energy dependence of the proton - nucleus optical potential in conventional relativistic mean - field models .",
    "the required energy and momentum dependence could be recovered by extending the relativistic hadrodynamics lagrangian by non - linear derivative interactions @xcite thus also mimicking many - body forces @xcite . considering the important role played e.g. by strange baryons and antibaryons production for a quantitative interpretation of high - energy heavy - ion collisions and dense hadronic systems",
    "it is clearly mandatory to test these concepts also in the strangeness sector .",
    "furthermore , it was pointed out recently @xcite that in - medium interactions of antibaryons may cause compressional effects and may thus provide additional information on the nuclear equation - of - state @xcite .",
    "therefore , the question if and to what extend g - parity is violated by antihyperons in nuclei is also a challenging problem by itself .",
    "antihyperons annihilate quickly in nuclei and conventional spectroscopic studies of bound systems comparable to hypernuclei are not feasible . as a consequence ,",

    "may be obtained via exclusive antihyperon - hyperon pair production close to threshold in antiproton - nucleus interactions .",
    "once these hyperons and antihyperons leave the nuclear environment they can be detected and their asymptotic momentum distributions will reflect the depth of the respective potentials . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that momentum correlations of emitted hyperon - antihyperon pairs can be used to extract information on the relative potential of hyperons and antihyperons in nuclei . since in the @xmath4",
    "center - of - mass the distribution of the free baryon - antibaryon pairs is non - isotropic , the analysis relied mainly on the _ transverse _ momenta of the coincident baryons and antibaryons .",

    "however , these schematic simulations ignored rescattering processes and refractive effects at the potential boundary .",
    "these effects are expected to erode the two - body character of the @xmath1 production and may thus diminish or even destroy the sensitivity . in order to go beyond the schematic calculations presented in refs . @xcite and to include simultaneously rescattering , refraction and absorption effects , we present here first realistic calculations of this new observable with a microscopic transport model .",

    "each parameter set shown in the following contains approximately 8000 @xmath1-pairs where both , the @xmath2 and the @xmath19 escaped the nucleus .",

    "[ fig:01 ] .",
    "consequently , free antihyperon - hyperon pairs are mainly produced at low nuclear densities corresponding to 20 to 25% of the central density .",
    "for scaling factors @xmath7 between 1 and 0.25 the average impact parameter persists at 3.8fm . only for @xmath7=0 a slight increase to 3.9fm",
    "is observed . at the same time",
    "the number of produced @xmath1-pairs remains fairly constant on a level of about 8700 events over the range @xmath22 and decreases for @xmath7 = 0 by about 15% to @xmath23 7500 events .",
    "this moderate decrease indicates that absorption does not change dramatically with the depth of the @xmath2-potential . in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] ( top ) the main variations are seen at small impact parameter .",
    "this suggests that the smaller number of events in case of a shallow antihyperon potential is caused by an increased absorption at more central collisions . for a quantitative interpretation one",
    "has to keep in mind , however , that also a potential - dependent rescattering can enhance the escape probability from the nucleus by decreasing the path length until the nuclear surface of particularly the antihyperons .",
    "the role of secondary deflection can be explored by the coplanarity of the @xmath1-pairs .",

    "the coplanarity is even less pronounced .",

    "elastic scattering will on the average decrease the longitudinal momentum and will broaden the transverse momentum distribution .",
    "[ fig:03 ] shows the longitudinal momenta ( top ) and transverse momenta ( bottom ) for @xmath2 and @xmath19-hyperons from exclusive pair production . since the antihyperons are emitted more forward in the center of mass , their ( longitudinal ) momentum distributions peak at values around 0.9@xmath26 , while for @xmath19-hyperons the typical momenta reach only half of this value .",
    "the decrease of the longitudinal momenta for both , @xmath19-hyperons as well as @xmath2-hyperons with deeper antihyperon potentials and hence more rescattering ( c.f .",
    "[ fig:02 ] ) is clearly seen in the top part of fig .",
    "[ fig:03 ] .",
    "because of the larger initial longitudinal momenta , scattering in the target nucleus is expected to lead to a larger absolute broadening of the @xmath2 transverse momentum distributions as compared to the lower momentum @xmath19-hyperons . as can be seen in the lower part of fig .",

    "the figure suggests that at small impact parameters the rescattering is indeed crucial for antihyperons being able to escape from the nucleus .    in fig .",

    "@xcite as well as the shift of the average @xmath5 towards more negative values are linked to the substantial transverse momentum broadening for the @xmath2-hyperons by secondary scattering ( c.f .",

    "but even in this region of @xmath31 a systematic variation of @xmath5 with the antihyperon potential might show up with improved statistics .    the international facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) presently under construction in darmstadt ( germany )",
    "will provide high intensity antiproton beams with momenta between 1.51 and 15@xmath26 . a unique feature of antiproton interactions in the energy range of panda is the large production cross section of hyperon - antihyperon pairs @xcite . at its full luminosity",
    "the production rate of @xmath33-pairs range from a few 100 per second for the @xmath34-channel , up to a few thousand per second for the @xmath1-channel in the elementary @xmath4-reaction . due to the strong absorption of antibaryons in nuclei this production rate",
    "will be lowered depending on the size of the target nucleus in antiproton - nucleus collisions . according to the gibuu calculations presented above , for a typical medium size target nucleus like @xmath11ne still several hundreds free @xmath1-pairs",
    "can be produced per second .",
    "for a nuclear target in this mass range and at maximum interaction rate , approximately 10 reconstructed @xmath1-pairs per second are expected @xcite .",
    "therefore , a measurement period of about one hour will provide a statistics exceeding that of the gibuu simulations shown above",
    ". this will be sufficient to reach a precision of about 10% for the scaling factor @xmath7 of the antilambda potential .",
    "these numbers illustrate that even on rather pessimistic assumption about the luminosity and/or the availability of the antiproton beam during the commissioning phase of the panda experiment , one can reach unique and relevant information on the behavior of strange antibaryons in nuclei shortly after the delivery of the first antiproton beam at fair ."
