    "an attitude / orientation control system is necessary for all satellites with different satellites requiring varying degrees of pointing accuracy .",
    "satellites with a high - gain directional antenna , a telescope , or an earth - imaging instrument as payloads require highly accurate ( few arcminutes or arcseconds ) pointing system . determining",
    "the current pointing position is of primary importance in such applications and it is usually achieved using star sensors : a wide - fov camera with online image processing capabilities which reduces the image data to an attitude quaternion that describes the rotation of the sensor coordinate system with respect to the earth - centered inertial ( eci ) coordinate system .",
    "this is achieved by applying multiple algorithms on the image in sequence @xcite .",
    "we have developed a low - cost star sensor _",
    "starsense _ to deploy on minisatellites and cubesats using off - the - shelf components , in which we have implemented a centroiding algorithm for finding centroids of stars seen in the image , a geometric voting algorithm for star pattern identification , and a quaternion estimator ( quest ) algorithm for quaternion estimation . to determine how each algorithm performs in terms of sky coverage , memory requirements , calculation time , and so on",
    ", we simulate the algorithms along with idealized and real hardware parameter inputs using a specially developed testing software package .    in this paper",
    ", we present a complete software package intended to evaluate the performance of algorithms implemented on the _ starsense_. this software package can be applied to any star sensor by changing the hardware parameters , such as the focal length of the imaging setup , the field of view ( fov ) of the camera , angle measurement accuracy , distortion effects , and others .",
    "it is written to run under matlab due to the simplicity of scripting and its excellent capability of visualizing the results .",
    "the implementation on actual star sensor electronics hardware will be done in c , keeping in view its easy portability to other platforms .    in section  [ sec : hardware_info ] , we briefly describe the hardware of the star sensor .",
    "section  [ sec : software ] describes the architecture of the software package we used to evaluate the algorithms .",
    "section  [ sec : algorithms ] describes the algorithms in detail . in section  [ sec : performance_est ] , we describe the testing methodology to analyze the performance parameters of these algorithms , and the final results from different tests .",
    "_ starsense _ is essentially a wide - field imaging camera with high sensitivity .",
    "the optics consists of a four - element tessar lens system designed to minimize chromatic aberration , coma , and distortion .",
    "the lens system is designed with weight as a limiting constraint , and a condition of seeing a minimum of 3 stars in fov in any field of the sky .",
    "the lens assembly is designed to sustain vibrations experienced during the satellite launch .",
    "a baffle is used to prevent the stray - light from the sun and the earth entering the optical system , thereby contributing to the sky background .",
    "in addition , we have used a thermal cut - down filter ( a hot mirror ) , which reflects the ir and uv wavelengths and only allows optical wavelengths from 450750 nm to pass through , to prevent the detector from getting heated by the direct sun .",
    "the imaging sensor is the only electronic component directly open to the radiation environment and , therefore , its performance is prone to degradation with time . we have used a radiation - hardened cmos detector star-1000 @xcite , which is sensitive to low light conditions due to its large pixel size ( @xmath0 @xmath1m@xmath2 ) .",
    "the optics has been designed specifically for this detector , so that the point spread function ( psf ) is spread over 4 pixels .",
    "the electronic system of _ starsense _ is inspired by cubestar @xcite .",
    "it is distributed over two separate printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) : detector pcb and image processor pcb .",
    "the image sensor and its biasing circuits are soldered on the detector pcb , which is fixed inside the star sensor structure in such a way that the focal plane of the star sensor optics coincides with the image sensor plane .",
    "the detector is connected to the image processor board through a flat plastic cable .",
    "such an arrangement allows for the image processor board to be removed from the structure without disturbing the focal plane alignment of the detector pcb . the readout system for the image sensor",
    "is implemented using a mil - grade spartan-6 field programmable gate array ( fpga ) @xcite on the image processor pcb .",
    "the pcb also hosts sdram , required for the online processing of images , and a flash memory for nonvolatile storage of the bitstream and a star catalog .",
    "figure  [ fig : processor_board ] shows the _ starsense _ image processor board .",
    "since the optics , electronics and the structure were fully designed in - house , their characteristic properties and modeling parameters are well known , and we have verified them using different calibration tests .",
    "these parameters are used as inputs to algorithms discussed further in the paper .",
    "the key parameters of the camera are described in table  [ table : camera_param ] , and the key features of the electronics system are presented in table  [ table : star_sensor_electronics ] . a detailed paper justifying the choice of the hardware and various design parameters is forthcoming .    ._starsense _ camera parameters [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ table : sky_coverage ]",
    "we have put together a complete software package to reduce star sensor images to quaternions and to evaluate the performance of the operational algorithms .",
    "the package simulates centroiding , geometric voting and quest algorithms , and evaluates such performance parameters as attitude accuracy , calculation time , required memory , star catalog size , sky coverage , etc . , and estimated the errors introduced by each algorithm .",
    "the testing is parametrized for different hardware parameters of the star sensor , such as the focal length of the imaging setup , fov of the camera , angle measurement accuracy , distortion effects , and others .",
    "we conclude with the following remarks :    * for our _ starsense _ , we find that a limiting magnitude of v=6.0 is optimal to get significant sky coverage with minimal calculation time . *",
    "this software package is robust , fast , user - friendly in terms varying hardware parameters , and easily portable to various operating platforms . * due to the parametrized approach in package development , it can be applied to evaluate the performance of such algorithms in any star sensor",
    ".    the source codes of the software package can be obtained from a github repository @xcite .",
