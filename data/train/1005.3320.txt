    "when twisting a strip of paper or acetate under high longitudinal tension , one observes , at a critical load , a buckling of the strip into a regular triangular pattern ( see figure [ fig : model_strip](a ) ) .",
    "the deformation is reversible .",
    "sheets of paper or acetate are for practical purposes inextensible and the observed pattern , consisting of helically stacked nearly - flat triangular facets , appears to be nature s way of achieving global twisting by means of local bending and minimal stretch .",
    "this mode of buckling does not appear to have been reported in the literature .",
    "perhaps this is because the phenomenon occurs at relatively large twisting angles and under relatively high tension ( in order to suppress the more common looping instability ) .",
    "the buckling pattern observed has ridges running at roughly @xmath1 angles to the centreline of the strip .",
    "the ridges radiate out from vertices on the edge of the strip where stress concentration occurs .",
    "there is superficial similarity with the well - known yoshimura or diamond buckling pattern of thin cylindrical shells ( yoshimura 1930 ) but this pattern requires compressive rather than tensile loading .",
    "the phenomenon of buckling of an _ extensible _ elastic strip under tension and twisting moment has been studied before . in the 1930s green considered buckling of twisted strips under constant tensile force , treating both the case of zero and non - zero end force ( green 1936 , green 1937 ) .",
    "buckling of a twisted orthotropic plate into a sinusoidal buckling pattern in the longitudinal direction was studied in crispino & benson ( 1986 ) .",
    "a numerical investigation of wrinkling of twisted plates was carried in mockensturm ( 2001 ) , considering both the case of constant end - to - end distance and the case of constant end force , and finding different results in the two cases . in the latter case",
    "it was found that buckling may occur in both the lateral and longitudinal directions .",
    "a perturbation method was used recently to further explore the wrinkling instability under small twist ( coman & bassom 2008 ) . as the twist increases from zero ,",
    "the surface of a strip first becomes helicoidal , which causes extensional forces near the edges while the core domain is in compression .",
    "when a critical twist and tension are reached , the core domain of the strip buckles into an oscillatory pattern .",
    "the surface near the edges remains helicoidal ; no strain localisation occurs .    the problem of bending and twisting of an _ inextensible _ flat plate has also been studied before .",
    "such a plate deforms isometrically and its surface is therefore developable ( i.e. , has zero gaussian curvature ) , making the analysis more geometrical .",
    "sadowsky developed a large - deformation theory of narrow elastic strips as early as in 1930 ( sadowsky 1931 ) .",
    "approximate equations for wide strips were derived in the mid-1950s by mansfield ( see mansfield 1989 ) .",
    "these equations predict the distribution of generators of the developable surface while ignoring the actual three - dimensional geometry .",
    "this work was followed up by ashwell ( 1962 ) , where localisation of stresses at two diagonally opposite corners is found for a strip in its first buckling mode .",
    "the actual shape of the strip was not computed .",
    "the constraint of zero gaussian curvature causes the buckling patterns of inextensible strips to differ strongly from the oscillatory buckling patterns of extensible strips .",
    "the helicoidal shape of the edges of the strip found in coman & bassom ( 2008 ) is not a solution for inextensible strips not even for infinitesimally small twist .",
    "rather we observe a sequence of relatively flat triangular domains which are not restricted to the core of the strip .",
    "the edges show a sequence of points with high curvature .",
    "it is worth noting that both responses , the smooth sinusoidal one and the localised one , can be observed on the same paper strip model depending on the environmental conditions . when the humidity is low and the paper is dry it behaves like an inextensible material . when it is slightly wet it becomes noticeably stretchable .",
    "note also that the solution for a slightly extensible strip is well described by the inextensible model almost everywhere except for small domains where the stress concentrates . in this paper",
    "we compute geometrically - exact developable solutions of inextensible strips .",
    "a geometrically - exact set of equilibrium equations for the large deformation of thin inextensible plates of finite width has recently been derived ( starostin & van  der heijden 2007 ) .",
    "the equations are ordinary differential equations and obtained by using the inextensibility constraint to reduce stresses and strains to the centreline of the strip .",
    "they are much easier to analyse than the usual partial differential equations of elastic plate theory .",
    "the new set of equations was used to solve a classical problem in mechanics , namely to find the equilibrium shape of a developable mbius strip ( starostin & van  der heijden 2007 ) .",
    "numerical solutions revealed the existence , for any aspect ratio of the strip , of a nearly flat triangular region associated with the ( unique ) inflection point of the strip ( see figure [ fig : model_strip](b ) ) .",
    "the triangular facet of the mbius strip solution clearly resembles the facets of the buckling pattern of the twisted strip in figure [ fig : model_strip](a ) and in this paper we use the new system of equations to construct post - buckling solutions in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the central idea is to modify the boundary - value problem for the mbius strip such as to ` cut out ' the triangular ( more precisely , trapezoidal ) region ( see figure [ fig : model_strip](c ) ) and to use symmetry to reflect and multiply the elementary triangular facet into a periodic triangular pattern .",
    "this procedure avoids having to integrate numerically through the bending energy singularity associated with the vertex of the triangle on the edge of the strip , as found in starostin & van  der heijden ( 2007 ) and analysed further in hornung ( 2009 ) .",
    "having obtained a post - buckling strip solution with a certain number , say @xmath0 , of triangular facets we then study the strip s force - extension and moment - twist behaviour for various mode numbers @xmath0 . neither gravity nor other distributed forces acting on the strip are taken into account in the present work .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the boundary - value problem for the centreline - reduced equations for a developable strip .",
    "we also use symmetry properties of the solution to construct triangular buckling patterns for the strip by concatenating elementary facets . in section 3",
    "we numerically solve the boundary - value problem and compute load - displacement curves for the post - buckling strip solutions for various mode numbers @xmath0 . in section 4",
    "we discuss our results and draw some conclusions .",
    "a sufficiently thin elastic surface will deform by bending only ( witten 2007 ) and therefore deform isometrically .",
    "if such a surface is flat in its unstressed state it will remain so under deformation and therefore have zero gaussian curvature ( graustein 1966 ) .",
    "it is said to be developable .",
    "now consider a rectangular sheet or strip . if @xmath2 is a parametrisation of the centreline of the strip , @xmath3 being arclength , then @xmath4,\\\\ \\tau(s)=\\eta(s)\\kappa(s ) , \\qquad s\\in [ 0,l ] , ~t\\in[-w , w ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] is a parametrisation of an embedded developable strip of length @xmath5 and width @xmath6 ( randrup & rgen 1996 ) . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are two unit vectors of the frenet frame @xmath9 of tangent , principal normal and binormal to the centreline , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the curvature and torsion of the centreline , which uniquely specify ( up to euclidean motions ) the centreline of the strip ( graustein 1966 ) . by equation , the surface , in turn ,",
    "is completely determined by the centreline of the structure .",
    "the straight lines @xmath12 are the generators of the surface , which make an angle @xmath13 with the positive tangent direction . given this parametrisation , the mean curvature @xmath14 can be easily calculated , e.g. , by using the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms of the surface , themselves calculated from partial derivatives of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath16 ( graustein 1966 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath17 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to arclength @xmath3 .",
    "introducing rectangular co - ordinates @xmath18 by developing the surface into a rectangle , @xmath19 the bending energy of a strip of thickness @xmath20 can be written as the following integral over the surface of the strip ( love 1927 ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 $ ] is the flexural rigidity , @xmath23 is young s modulus and @xmath24 is poisson s ratio .",
    "when @xmath14 ( given by ) is substituted into , and the co - ordinates changed to @xmath25 , the @xmath16 integration can be carried out ( wunderlich 1962 ) giving @xmath26 with @xmath27 in the zero - width limit , @xmath28 , this reduces to the sadowsky result @xmath29 ( sadowsky 1931 ) .",
    "minimisation of this elastic energy functional is a one - dimensional variational problem cast in a form that is invariant under euclidean motions . in anderson ( 1989 )",
    "euler - lagrange equations for such geometric variational problems are derived in a general context via a splitting of the cotangent bundle @xmath30 of the infinite jet bundle @xmath31 of a fibred manifold , which induces a bigrading of the differential forms on @xmath31 known as the variational bicomplex ( see also kogan & olver 2003 ) . in more physical terms",
    "they can be written in the form of six balance equations for the ( normalised ) components of the internal force , @xmath32 , and moment , @xmath33 , in the directions of the frenet frame , and two scalar equations ( starostin & van  der heijden 2007 , starostin & van  der heijden 2009 ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the darboux vector .",
    "the equations are nothing but the vectorial fixed - frame force and moment balance equations @xmath36 , @xmath37 , written out in the frenet frame .",
    "( here we adopt the convention that bold roman symbols are used for vectors while bold italic symbols are used for triples of components of these vectors in the frenet frame . )",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are first integrals of the equations . note that the first equation in is algebraic in the variables @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , while the second is a second - order ordinary differential equation ( ode ) in @xmath41 .    it will be of interest to a more general audience how the same equations can be obtained from first principles using standard variational methods , extending to a function of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 the examples in capovilla _",
    "et al_. ( 2002 ) ( which covers functional dependence up to @xmath43 only ) .",
    "this is done in the appendix , where it is shown that it is straightforward to accommodate the additional functional dependence on @xmath46 without computing any new variations , by simply reusing the results already given in capovilla _",
    "et al_. ( 2002 ) and langer & perline ( 1991 ) .",
    "the additional terms generated by the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath44 and @xmath45 are easily managed .",
    "it is straightforward to extend this method to a functional involving any number of derivatives of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and hence obtain the closed - form expressions given in starostin & van  der heijden ( 2009 ) .",
    "the shape of the strip s centreline is found by first differentiating the first equation in in order to turn it into a differential equation and then numerically solving equations and as a boundary - value problem ( bvp ) in conjunction with three euler - angle equations describing the evolution of the frenet frame relative to a fixed frame , and the centreline equation @xmath48 . taking love s convention for the euler angles @xmath49 ( love 1927 ) ,",
    "the derivatives of the angles are related to the curvature and torsion as @xmath50 while the centreline equation in component form gives @xmath51 equation can be written down directly from the darboux vector by noting that love s convention is the usual @xmath52-convention ( van  der heijden & thompson 2000 ) in classical mechanics with @xmath53 and @xmath54 interchanged ( goldstein 1980 ) .",
    "alternatively it can be obtained from the frenet - serret equations .",
    "the convention is such that the polar singularity ( here at @xmath55 ) usually associated with euler angles does not cause any problems for the solutions we are interested in ( the flat strip will have @xmath56 ) .",
    "alternatively a 4-parameter quaternion representation can be used to avoid the singularity at the expense of a norm condition .    before we specify",
    "the boundary conditions let s have a closer look at the buckling pattern in figure [ fig : model_strip](a ) and the mbius strip solution in figure [ fig : model_strip](b ) .",
    "the mbius strip solution has special points where either @xmath41 or @xmath57 is zero .",
    "points where @xmath58 are called cylindrical points as the surface is locally a cylinder , i.e. , the mean curvature in is constant along the local generator . in figure",
    "[ fig : model_strip](b ) this corresponds to a generator of constant colour .",
    "points where @xmath59 , by contrast , are called conical because the edge of regression , on which nearby generators intersect each other , has a cusp . at these conical points",
    "the generator is perpendicular to the centreline , as follows from .",
    "clearly there must be at least one point where @xmath58 between any two points with @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , the mbius strip has three cylindrical points and three conical points , one of the latter being special because it corresponds to the only inflection point of the centreline ( where @xmath60 ) . at this point",
    "the binormal component of both the force and the moment are zero .",
    "furthermore it is found that at the inflection point , @xmath61 ( i.e. , the edge of regression reaches the edge of the strip ) and the bending energy density @xmath47 diverges , i.e. , we have stress concentration . as is seen in figure [ fig : model_strip](b ) ,",
    "coming out of this singular point is a nearly flat ( violet ) triangular region .",
    "now , turning to figure [ fig : model_strip](a ) we observe that the buckling pattern consists of points of high stress located alternatingly on both edges of the strip , while locally cylindrical ridges bound flat triangular ( more precisely , trapezoidal ) regions similar to those found in the mbius strip solution .",
    "this suggests that we can describe the buckling pattern by a solution of the equations built up of alternating copies of the trapezoidal section between the inflection point ( where @xmath59 ) and the nearest cylindrical point ( where @xmath58 ) . a cut - out of this section",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : model_strip](c ) .",
    "note that both bounding generators are of constant colour , illustrating that the section can be reflected about both end generators .",
    "a two - step symmetry operation is therefore used to construct a strip of length @xmath62 from a trapezoid of length @xmath63 .",
    "let the arclength parameter of the centreline be @xmath64 at the cylindrical point ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath65 at the inflection point ( @xmath59 ) ( see figure [ fig : model_strip](c ) ) .",
    "the first operation is a rotation through 180@xmath66 of the trapezoid about the normal @xmath67 at @xmath64 ( see also figure [ fig : rotations1 ] ) .",
    "the original and the rotated trapezoid together make a continuous surface , which forms one period of the full strip ( @xmath68 of figure [ fig : rotations1 ] ) , of length @xmath69 .",
    "the binormal to the strip at the inflection point is denoted @xmath70",
    ".     mode @xmath71 symmetry operations .",
    "the first half period is rotated about @xmath67 to form the first period @xmath72 .",
    "rotating @xmath72 about @xmath73 produces the second period @xmath74 .",
    "rotating @xmath74 about @xmath75 , then @xmath76 about @xmath77 , produces the final two periods of the figure.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    in the second step a symmetrical strip of @xmath78 periods is obtained from a parent strip of @xmath0 periods by rotating an end period of the parent strip 180@xmath66 about the end binormal .",
    "this binormal is located at the inflection point of that end period and therefore aligned with the end generator .",
    "thus strips of any period can be built up in this way by successively reflecting an end period about its end binormal .",
    "the length of the centreline of a symmetrical strip of @xmath0 periods made in this way is therefore @xmath62 . in particular , let @xmath79 , @xmath80 be respectively the position vectors of the centreline at the inflection and cylindrical points of the trapezoid solution of the bvp .",
    "define a rotation of @xmath81 around the unit vector @xmath82 , @xmath83 then the first and subsequent periods are obtained by the iteration @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath86 are then the unit binormals at the inflection points of the periods of the strip .",
    "the reflection rules in are for the centreline , but can be easily generalised to the whole surface , as was done in starostin & van  der heijden ( 2007 ) to obtain closed - strip solutions from the trapezoid solution of the bvp .",
    "these reflection rules are shown in figure [ fig : rotations1 ] for the example @xmath71 with the relevant binormals shown .",
    "the initial trapezoid ( with one boundary aligned with @xmath70 ) is rotated about @xmath67 giving the first period @xmath68 .",
    "this first period is then rotated about @xmath73 to give the second period @xmath87 , which itself is rotated about @xmath75 to give the third period @xmath88 .",
    "finally the third period is rotated about @xmath77 to give the fourth period @xmath89 .",
    "it remains to formulate the boundary conditions for the initial trapezoid . at @xmath64",
    "these are @xmath90 where the values for @xmath91 , @xmath52 and @xmath92 fix an arbitrary position in space , and @xmath93 which can be read off as the @xmath64 limit of the first equation of , where @xmath94 .",
    "equation is required to fix the integration constant for the ode obtained by differentiating the first equation of .",

    "the boundary conditions at @xmath65 are @xmath96 where the angles fix an arbitrary orientation of the strip in space .",
    "the force and moment boundary conditions in and are enforced by the rotational symmetry .",
    "since @xmath67 and @xmath70 are local axes of rotational ( or reflection ) symmetry , any component of force and moment along those axes must vanish .",
    "this guarantees continuity of forces and moments in the strip and therefore yields a valid solution of the mechanical problem .",
    "the remaining boundary conditions for the system of odes are the projections of the end force and moment of the strip on the end - to - end unit vector @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 where @xmath100 are also continuation ( control ) parameters .",
    "equations  give a final count of @xmath101 boundary conditions for the same number of first - order odes .",
    "the bvp is solved by continuation of each of the boundary conditions in in turn . to obtain the starting solution of the continuation , the numerical solution of the mbius strip between the inflection point and nearest cylindrical point",
    "is continued in @xmath102 and @xmath103 until equations are satisfied .",
    "there are significant numerical difficulties solving this bvp as both ends of the integration interval have a singularity . the boundary condition @xmath104 enforces an inflection point at @xmath105 . at this point",
    "the torsion @xmath11 must also be zero and in fact it must go to zero , in @xmath3 , faster than the curvature @xmath10 ( randrup & rgen 1996 ) .",
    "therefore we also have @xmath106 . in practice , to compute a starting solution we first compute an approximate solution with @xmath107 to stay away from the singularity at @xmath105 . when all other boundary conditions are satisfied we ` pull ' the solution into the singularity by continuing @xmath108 to zero as far as possible , typically reaching values of 0.001 . at this point",
    "we typically have @xmath109 , while @xmath110 , the distance from the singularity , is typically as small as @xmath111 .    at the other singularity , at @xmath64 ,",
    "numerical convergence requires taylor expansions ( up to fourth order in our case ) of the left - hand sides of equations about @xmath58 to be used for a small interval around @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , to improve convergence , the absolute value of the logarithm is taken in equation .",
    "we note that it has not proved possible ( for instance by similar taylor expansions ) to remove the singularity in at @xmath112 .    as a check on the numerical results ,",
    "the first integrals @xmath38 and @xmath39 are typically found to be constant to within @xmath113 .",
    "once the bvp has been solved , the surface of the strip is obtained from and the reflection rules .",
    "we note that no measures in the above formulation are taken to prevent self - intersection of the strip .",

    ", strips for different modes have been scaled to the same aspect ratio @xmath133 .",
    "parts of these curves with positive slope are expected to correspond to stable solutions .",
    "the curves predict that , for @xmath151 , under increasing tension solutions jump to higher mode ( down in @xmath115 ) as the force is increased beyond the folds seen in the diagram .",
    "when twisted , and pulled , an acetate model strip buckles into a regular pattern of triangular facets .",
    "we have computed periodic solutions describing this buckling pattern by formulating and numerically solving a geometrically - exact boundary - value problem for the large deformation of a thin , wide , inextensible strip .",
    "we have also obtained response curves of force against end - to - end distance and twisting moment against end - to - end angle for mode numbers @xmath135 , 4 and 8 .",
    "our results predict critical forces and jumps into higher buckling modes that would be interesting to explore experimentally .    by construction",
    "our solutions are periodic , which tends to be what one observes in experiments .",
    "however , non - periodic solutions can be constructed in a similar way by matching different trapezoidal segments .",
    "one would keep the first symmetry operation ( reflection about the normal at the cylindrical point ) but instead of reflecting about the binormal at the inflection point in the second step one could match the segment to a ( suitably rescaled ) trapezoidal segment of different length @xmath63 .",
    "the resulting solution would no longer be symmetric about the inflection points .    in mansfield ( 1989 ) and ashwell ( 1962 ) analyses",
    "were performed similar to ours in that there too the double strain energy integral was reduced by integrating along the generator .",
    "however , the integrand expression was subsequently simplified by using an approximate moment balance equation that ignores the non - planarity of the strip .",
    "this approach gives a realistic evolution of the generator with arclength , but fails to predict the appearance of a cylindrical point at finite distance from the clamped end of the strip .",
    "triangular patterns are known to occur in a variety of problems of elastic sheets , including fabric draping and paper crumpling ( witten 2007 ) .",
    "a sheet crumples ( forming sharp points and straight creases ) when it is forced into a constrained area .",
    "the sheet is predominantly under compression .",
    "it is interesting to note that , by constrast , in our triangular buckling pattern the strip is in ( relatively high ) tension . in both cases",
    "we observe a focussing of the strain energy which may lead to fracture of the material .",
    "strain energy localisation thus appears to be a generic response of a thin elastic sheet to an external constraint .",
    "our results may be relevant for paper , fabric and sheet metal processing .",
    "they may also be of importance in the robotic manipulation of flexible belts , e.g. , film circuit boards ( wakamatsu _ et al_. 2007 ) .",
    "in all these sheet manipulations it is important to avoid shapes with high concentrated stresses that may lead to tearing .",
    "our formulation may help to choose boundary conditions that avoid unwanted configurations .",
    "we wish to calculate the variation of the functional @xmath152 .",
    "this calculation can be done using the formulation of capovilla _ et al_. ( 2002 ) , substituting explicit expressions for quantities wherever they arise and grouping similar terms , which gives fully simplified expressions for all quantities of interest .    alternatively , one can re - use the variations already calculated in capovilla _ et al_. ( 2002 ) , to yield the same results , without having to compute new variations .",
    "there , for example , the variation is given for @xmath153 , stating that it can be written down from the variations of @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which are previously calculated . the resulting force and moment corresponding to @xmath156",
    "can then be written down from the expressions for the force and moment for @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "this follows from the chain rule .",
    "similarly , one can calculate the variation of the functional @xmath152 using @xmath159 without computing new variations .",
    "this follows as a consequence of the chain and product rules in differentiation . the resulting force and moment corresponding to @xmath160",
    "can then be written down from the expressions for the force and moment for @xmath156 , with a small number of additional terms arising from the chain and product rules .    instead of following these approaches",
    ", we here use a third and more economical method by leaving @xmath161 expressed in terms of @xmath162 and @xmath163 only . this method is easily generalised to functionals involving higher derivatives of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . following the notation of capovilla _ et al_. ( 2002 ) , the infinitesimal deformation of a space curve is @xmath164 , and denoting @xmath165 as the tangential and normal parts of the deformation respectively , the variation of any functional @xmath166 is @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "we therefore need to calculate the second term on the right - hand side of equation , where by the chain rule , @xmath169 , using the notation @xmath170 .",
    "since for any scalar @xmath171 , @xmath172 , then @xmath173 where @xmath174 and @xmath175 are given in capovilla _ et al_. ( 2002 ) .",
    "equation along with equation is of the form @xmath176 with @xmath177 the noether charge , so that the euler - lagrange equations @xmath178 can be immediately written down , since these are just the coefficients of @xmath179 which can be read off from equation .",
    "these are two coupled differential equations in the unknowns @xmath180 , and the known density @xmath181 , which are quoted in general form in thamwattana _ et al_. ( 2008 ) and in hangan ( 2005 ) for the sadowsky functional .",
    "apart from the euler - lagrange equations , it is of interest to find expressions for the conserved force @xmath182 and the moment @xmath183 .",
    "the force @xmath182 is obtained by specialising the deformation to a constant infinitesimal translation @xmath184 , where @xmath182 is defined by @xmath185 .",
    "similarly , the conserved moment @xmath186 is obtained by specialising the deformation to a constant infinitesimal rotation @xmath187 , where @xmath186 is defined by @xmath188 and decomposed into @xmath189 .",
    "thus only the total derivative parts of contribute to @xmath182 and @xmath183 . but these contributions can be read off from the results in capovilla _ et al_. ( 2002 ) by noting that a term in equation of the form @xmath190 , where @xmath191 , has to be re - expressed in the form to isolate its total derivative part .",
    "this has already been done in capovilla _ et al_. ( 2002 ) . for a term in equation of the form @xmath192 ,",
    "one just needs the contribution from @xmath193 .",
    "thus , for an infinitesimal rotation @xmath194 and @xmath195 . using the compact expressions of langer & perline ( 1991 ) ( equations ( 3.7b , c ) ) , @xmath196 gives @xmath197 , i.e. , @xmath198 .",
    "but @xmath199 , giving @xmath200 .",
    "as this is of the form @xmath201 , @xmath202 in does not contribute to the moment @xmath183 .",
    "similarly , @xmath203 , giving @xmath204 . as this is of the form @xmath201 , @xmath205 in also does not contribute to the moment @xmath183 .",
    "( note that by retaining these terms one would obtain the force @xmath206 , but in the next paragraph we will , instead , calculate @xmath206 by considering a constant infinitesimal translation . ) now , from capovilla _",
    "et al_. ( 2002 ) ( equations ( 49 ) and ( 67 ) ) , @xmath207 contributes @xmath208 to the moment , whereas @xmath209 contributes @xmath210 .",
    "thus from equations and one can immediately write down the moment as :      in order to calculate the contribution to the force of @xmath212 , one notes that since @xmath184 is a constant , it follows from the formulation of langer & perline ( 1991 ) ( equations ( 3.7b , c ) ) that @xmath197 , i.e. , @xmath213 .",
    "thus the contribution of @xmath214 in to @xmath182 is @xmath215 . in a similar manner , for this constant translation , @xmath216 , giving @xmath217 , so that @xmath218 in contributes @xmath219 to the force .",
    "now from capovilla _ et al_. ( 2002 ) ( equations ( 48 ) and ( 64 ) ) , @xmath207 contributes @xmath220 to the force , whereas @xmath209 contributes @xmath221 .",
    "also , @xmath222 contributes @xmath223 to the force .",
    "thus from equations and one can immediately write down the force as : @xmath224    from these components of @xmath182 and @xmath183 , the differential equations for the moment components and the differential equation for @xmath225 in equation are easily obtained . for instance , from it is seen that @xmath226 , while equations for @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath225 can be extracted similarly .",
    "the remaining two equations for @xmath229 and @xmath230 are obtained from and the euler - lagrange equations @xmath178 .    in summary , the variation of @xmath152 can be easily obtained from the variations @xmath231 .",
    "their explicit expressions are not required ; their contributions can be read off from capovilla _ et al _ ( 2002 ) .",
    "the additional terms generated by the additional dependence of @xmath181 on @xmath44 and @xmath45 are therefore easily managed .",
    "one way of regarding equations and , is that they prescribe @xmath182 and @xmath183 once @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the given density @xmath181 are known .",
    "the two euler - lagrange equations for @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given by @xmath178 , i.e. , by setting the coefficients of @xmath179 to zero in equation .",
    "instead of solving the problem this way , however , it is preferable to set up an equivalent system of coupled one - dimensional odes as in starostin & van  der heijden ( 2009 ) .",
    "one way to do this is to use the natural variables @xmath182 and @xmath183 , and , for the functional , to change variables from @xmath232 to @xmath233 .    by considering functionals of the form @xmath234",
