    "the strichartz estimates originated by strichartz @xcite have been extensively studied by many authors ( @xcite ) . over the past several years , considerable attention has been paid to the fractional order where @xmath1 in the radial case ( see @xcite and references therein ) . from these works , when @xmath15 , the homogeneous strichartz estimate @xmath16 holds for radial functions @xmath17 if @xmath18 here the condition is optimal if @xmath19 .",

    "this means that @xmath24 and @xmath25 lie on the segment @xmath27 in figure [ figure ] .",
