    "since 2001 when superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 was first discovered @xcite , many calculations of its bulk and surface electronic structure have been performed . in general , these calculations showed a good agreement with arpes experiments , suggesting that mgb@xmath0 is not a strongly correlated system , and that superconductivity is probably a consequence of some strong electron - phonon coupling mechanism .",
    "in other words , mgb@xmath0 appears to be an extreme case of an eliashberg superconductor .",
    "indeed , many studies show strong coupling of @xmath6 electrons and @xmath9 phonons in the b layer , and a wide superconducting gap in the @xmath6 band has been measured @xcite .",
    "also , since the recent fabrication of pristine ultra - thin mgb@xmath0 films @xcite , surface enhanced superconductivity has become an increasingly active area of research @xcite .",
    "these theoretical investigations greatly contributed to the understanding of the peculiar bulk / surface electronic structure of the seemingly simple mgb@xmath0 crystal .",
    "bulk electronic structure calculations @xcite show that mgb@xmath0 has five main bands , namely completely filled @xmath1 b , partially filled @xmath10 , @xmath4 and @xmath11 b , along with completely unoccupied @xmath7 mg bands .",
    "bonding within the b layers is mostly covalent ( @xmath12 hybridization ) and ionic / metallic between b",
    " b layers .",
    "due to the mg between the b planes , the nature of in - plane covalent bonding is not typical , as in graphite for example .",
    "specifically , the presence of mg enhances the inter - layer overlap and induces strong hybridization between dangling b @xmath11 and mg @xmath7 orbitals ( @xmath2 bond ) .",
    "this causes an upward shift of the mg @xmath7 and downward shift of the b @xmath11 band . in other words",
    ", this induces an emptying of the mg @xmath7 and filling of the b @xmath11 bands . in this way",
    "mg atoms donate electrons interstitially ( between b  mg layers ) and become positively ionized .",
    "this causes an additional downward shift of the b @xmath13 band relative to the b @xmath6 bands and charge transfer from the @xmath6 to the @xmath13 band .",
    "in this way mgb@xmath0 has a small hole doping of the higher energy @xmath10 and @xmath14 bands ( at the @xmath15 point ) and bonds within the b layers become mixed covalent / metallic .",
    "such hole doping in the b layers enhances the superconductivity .",
    "this is similar to the case of intercalated graphites @xcite , where doping ( inter - plane intercalation ) by alkali metals causes the graphite to become superconducting .",
    "the above description is also consistent with charge density distributions calculated in ref .  , where it was seen that mg atoms are strongly ionized , but electrons are donated interstitially , rather than directly to the b layers , and inter - layer bonding is much more metallic than ionic .",
    "also , it has been shown that less charge is participating in the in - plane b ",
    "b bonding in mgb@xmath0 compared to the c  c bonding in primitive graphite .",
    "this suggests that mg induces a covalent bonding in the b layer which is not completely saturated and is weakened , i.e.  slightly metallic .    on the other hand ,",
    "the electronic structure of the mgb@xmath0 surface is much more delicate .",
    "due to the weak dispersion of bulk b @xmath6 bands in the ( 0001 ) direction , there exist two wide gaps in the projected bulk band structure of mgb@xmath0 at the @xmath16 point .",
    "this allows for the formation of many different types of surface states .",
    "indeed , several studies of the mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface @xcite showed the existence of various surface and subsurface states , whose positions and existence depend on crystal termination and coverage @xcite .    for the case of a b terminated surface , every bulk band has its own surface state band which follows the upper edge of the corresponding projected bulk band .",
    "all these states are mostly localized in the first few b layers .",
    "for example , the surface state band for b terminated mgb@xmath0 reported in ref .   has @xmath11 symmetry and is located on the upper edge of the projected @xmath11 bulk band .",
    "it s energy at the @xmath16 point in the surface brillouin zone ( spz ) is about @xmath17  ev and its charge density is mostly distributed throughout the first three b layers .    in the case of the mg terminated surface ,",
    "there is one surface state whose energy at the @xmath16 point is about @xmath18  ev .",
    "this surface state has @xmath2 symmetry and is mostly localized above the surface plane in the vacuum region ( supra - surface ) .",
    "however , arpes measurements which followed @xcite showed a good agreement with bulk electronic structure calculations @xcite , although the peak at @xmath19  ev in the normal photo - emission does not agree with any of the above mentioned surface states .",
    "the calculations of servedio _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed good agreement but are not particularly relevant , as the surface potential barrier was there modeled by a step potential , so that the binding energy of the surface state was strongly dependent on the position of the potential step . on the other hand , calculations by profeta _",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath2 surface state at the @xmath16 point strongly depends on the termination and coverage of the mgb@xmath0 crystal , indicating that in the experiment @xcite the surface termination may have been mixed or had significant surface contamination .",
    "@xcite paid much more attention to surface preparation , and in their measurement the normal photo - emission peak appeared at @xmath20  ev . in refs .   an @xmath21 monolayer ( ml ) thick ( @xmath21 ml b and @xmath21 ml mg layers ) mgb@xmath0 film was deposited an a mg(0001 ) substrate using the molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) co - deposition technique . following this it was determined ( using several techniques including xps , leed+xrd , x ray absorption ) that indeed , there was no surface contamination , and arpes measurements were then performed .",
    "the results showed an excellent agreement of the projected bulk band structure with bulk calculations @xcite .",
    "agreement with surface band structure calculations @xcite was also quite good .",
    "for example , peaks at about @xmath22  ev and @xmath23  ev are measured which correspond to @xmath2 surface states in mg and b terminated surfaces respectively .",
    "measurements in refs .   also suggested that the most stable surface termination is mg , as was anticipated in refs .  .",
    "recent experimental realizations of the mgb@xmath0 surface have been brought to an increasingly high level of precision @xcite .",
    "these experiments were aimed at investigating the fine superconductivity properties of mgb@xmath0 , e.g. , multiple superconductivity gaps @xcite , and surface enhanced superconductivity @xcite .",
    "however , such clean mgb@xmath0 surfaces , with a very well defined electronic structure , can also be an excellent starting point for the investigation of both optical and dielectric mgb@xmath0 surface properties .",
    "it also should be noted that in ref .",
    "ultrathin mgb@xmath0 films down to @xmath24  nm were fabricated , which is quite close to the thicknesses used in the calculations shown herein .",
    "interplay between 2d and 3d electronic structures give rise to the unique dielectric @xcite and extraordinary optical properties @xcite of the mgb@xmath0 crystal . on the other hand , because of the plethora of surface , localized and subsurface states , the mgb@xmath0 surface dielectric and optical properties may be even more interesting . before providing such theoretical calculations",
    "we require an accurate description of the surface electronic structure .",
    "for this reason , we will focus here on the investigation of three ( b , mg and li ) terminated mgb@xmath0 surface electronic structures by comparing the results of three different ( two plane wave and real space ) _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) methods . in so doing",
    ", we may demonstrate how by changing the surface termination , charging , and doping the mgb@xmath0(0001 ) we may tune both the localization and energy range of the surface and subsurface states , with potential applications in the areas of plasmonics and superconductivity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ compmeth ] we describe the _ ab initio _ methods used for the surface electronic structure calculations , the description of surface formation energies , and develop criteria to distinguish between surface , subsurface , vacuum , and bulk states .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ numres ] for b , mg , and li terminated surfaces , with results for each termination in separate subsections . these results are then discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ conclus ] , where we show how surface termination and electro - chemical doping may be used to tune mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface states .",
    "this is followed by a concluding section .",
    "structural optimization and electronic structure calculations for each mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface have been performed by combining three different _ ab initio _ codes . specifically , we compare our own pseudopotential based plane wave dft code ( sppw ) and the plane wave self - consistent field dft code ( pwscf ) belonging to the quantum espresso ( qe ) package @xcite , with a real - space projector augmented wave function method dft code ( gpaw ) @xcite .    in each case",
    "we have employed the perdew - zunger local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange correlation ( xc)-potential @xcite .",
    "an electronic temperature of @xmath25 ev was used to converge the kohn - sham wavefunctions , with all energies extrapolated to 0 k. the electronic density was calculated using a @xmath26 monkhorst - pack special @xmath27-point mesh , i.e.  by using @xmath28 special points in the irreducible brillouin zone .    in both sppw and pwscf , lda based pseudopotentials for li , mg and b@xcite were used , and the energy spectrum was found to be converged with a @xmath29  ry plane wave cutoff . for gpaw we employed a grid spacing @xmath30    in the mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface plane , and @xmath31    normal to the surface , which yielded converged results .",

    "as initial atomic coordinates we consider the system to be a hexagonal lattice with lattice parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 taken from the bulk experimental values , @xmath34  a.u .",
    "@xmath35    and @xmath36  a.u .",
    "@xmath37    from ref .  , which were previously shown to change by less than 0.6% upon structural optimization of the mgb@xmath0 bulk @xcite .",
    "structural optimization is performed within qe @xcite , and the system is structurally optimized until a maximum force below @xmath38  ry / a.u .",

    "schematics of the relaxed mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface supercell models with b , mg , and li termination are shown in fig .",
    "[ mgb2_surfaces ] .",
    "the b terminated surface was modeled using a supercell consisting of @xmath40 mg and @xmath41 b alternating layers , while the mg terminated surface was obtained by adding mg layers on top of each surface , with the li terminated surface formed by replacing the two mg surface layers with two li layers . for all terminations four unit cells of vacuum , i.e. @xmath42  a.u .",
    "@xmath43   , were used to separate the surfaces .",
    "this was found to be sufficient to ensure a good description of both surface and bulk states .",
    ".gpaw calculated formation energies @xmath44 for b , mg , and li terminated mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface in ev / @xmath45 and j / m@xmath45 relative to bulk mgb@xmath0 and the chemical potential of the terminating metal in the bulk for species @xmath46 , @xmath47 , taken from ref .  . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to understand how surface charging , or electro - chemical doping might affect mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface states , we have directly replaced mg by li in the first atomic layer ( mg@xmath48li ) . in effect , this approximates the removal of one electron from each of the mg terminated surfaces . in other words , replacing mg by li resembles a positively charged mg terminated ( mg@xmath8 ) surface .",
    "this allows us to directly probe the effect of surface charging of the mg terminated surface without the need for compensating background charges in the calculation .",
    "we have then performed structural optimization of the li terminated mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface to model how li termination changes the surface states . from table",
    "[ table3 ] we see that the smaller atomic radius of li induces a substantial relaxation , with the relaxed li atomic layer moved down by 52.4 pm towards the b atomic layer .    both the surface charging and the crystal structure modification strongly change the electronic structure of the surface states .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows that the lowest b @xmath1 surface resonance band for the structurally unoptimized surface ( mg@xmath48li@xmath49mg@xmath8 ) , is slightly separated from the upper edge of the bulk b @xmath1 band .",
    "the density distributions of such states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a , b , c , f ) , where we see that b @xmath1 surface resonances are mainly localized in the four topmost b layers .",
    "structural optimization causes a slight downward shift of the surface resonance b @xmath1 bands and induces a strong interaction / hybridization with the bulk b @xmath1 band , so that they decay into the bulk states .",
    "i.e. , it increases the amplitude of the propagation of the resonance state into the bulk , as can be seen at the @xmath16 point in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) . for @xmath50 and @xmath51 points",
    ", the b @xmath1 surface resonances can not even be distinguished from the normal bulk states and are not shown .",
    "this is seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig_gpaw_li ] , with the relaxed li terminated b @xmath1 surface states becoming increasingly bulk - like between @xmath16 and k , until @xmath52 .    relaxation also causes a @xmath53  ev reduction of the binding energy of the @xmath2 supra - surface state band .",
    "this is expected because relaxation causes contraction of the topmost li - b interstitial region ( _ cf .",
    "_  table [ table3 ] ) where the @xmath2 surface state is mostly located ( _ cf . _  fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the binding energy of the @xmath2 surface state at @xmath16 point is strongly reduced , from about @xmath54  ev to @xmath55  ev , comparing with the b terminated surface .",
    "this suggests that the binding energy of the @xmath2 surface state at the @xmath16 point may be strongly influenced by surface contamination or doping of the b terminated surface , as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "we also find the more localized b @xmath10 and @xmath14 bands are strongly modified by li termination . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for mg@xmath48li@xmath49mg@xmath8 , the b @xmath3 and @xmath14 surface bands are always slightly separated from the upper edge of the bulk b @xmath3 and @xmath14 bands , with their density highly localized in the first one or two b layers , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6](g , e , h ) .",
    "these states resemble the highly localized b @xmath3 and @xmath14 surface states in the b terminated surface . however , surface relaxation shifts the localized b @xmath10 and @xmath14 bands down in energy .",
    "this causes a strong interaction between localized and bulk @xmath6 states , with the surface state decaying into the bulk states .",
    "this is clearly illustrated by the densities of these states for the relaxed li terminated structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](e , h ) . here",
    "we see that the @xmath6 localized state now penetrates substantially into the crystal . by plotting the same distributions for an extended crystal structure ( _ cf .",

    "[ fig_gpaw_b ] , [ fig_gpaw_mg ] , and [ fig_gpaw_li ] , respectively , clear trends emerge .",
    "these suggest that changing surface termination or doping electro - chemically can tune both the energy and localization of the mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface states .    to demonstrate this point , we replot in fig .  [ trends ] the energies of the surface and subsurface states at the @xmath16 point as a function of surface termination .",
    "as we move from left to right in fig .",
    "[ trends ] , charge is transferred to the b atomic layer , as we move from neutral ( b ) , to charging of less than @xmath60 ( mg@xmath48li@xmath49mg@xmath8 ) , of about @xmath60 ( li ) , and finally , of about @xmath61 ( mg ) . as charge",
    "is donated to the b atomic layer , both the degenerate b @xmath3 and @xmath14 levels ( shown in fig .  [ trends](a ) ) and b @xmath1 levels ( shown in fig .  [ trends](c ) ) are filled and move down in energy relative to the bulk mgb@xmath0 fermi level , in a quasi - linear fashion .",
    "further , when surface states cross the bulk b @xmath6 bands , they hybridize , and lose much of their weight on the surface .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_gpaw_li ] , where for the b @xmath3 and @xmath14 states @xmath62 , and the b @xmath1 state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , also has more weight in the bulk .",
    "this strongly suggests that by electro - chemically doping the surface , we may tune both the energy and localization of the b @xmath6 surface states .    for the higher energy b @xmath3 and @xmath14 surface states",
    "this is particularly interesting , as they resemble quantum well ( qw ) states .",
    "this is because the occupying electrons effectively feel the potential of a qw centered around the b layer .",
    "moreover , electrons in such states are trapped in the topmost b layer but are `` free '' to move within the band . in this way , the b @xmath6 band may be considered a 2d electron gas decoupled from the surrounding 3d electron gas of the bulk mgb@xmath0 .",
    "such a two - component electron plasma allows different types of plasma dispersions relations .",
    "for example , a noble acoustic plasmon may be present , whose dispersion resembles that of the acoustic plasmons .",
    "such a plasmon may affect ( screen ) the electron - phonon coupling .    on the other hand , for the @xmath2 state shown in fig .",
    "[ trends](b ) , the energy of the surface state does not correlate with charging of the b atomic layer . instead , to understand the behavior of the @xmath2 state",
    ", we must first consider its projected density @xmath63 .",
    "for each termination we find that the @xmath2 state is an ionic / metallic bonding state between the mg / li and b atomic layers .",
    "this is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , [ fig4](a ) , and [ fig6](d ) , where we see that the @xmath2 state has mostly @xmath11 character localized in the inter - layer region .",
    "specifically , for b termination the @xmath2 has significant weight in the bulk , while for mg and li terminations the @xmath2 state has more @xmath7 character , with significant weight in the vacuum region .",
    "this is also clear from the band structures shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_gpaw_b ] , [ fig_gpaw_mg ] , and [ fig_gpaw_li ] .",
    "specifically , for b termination ( _ cf .",
    "_  fig .",
    "[ fig_gpaw_b ] ) the @xmath2 state is at the top of the broad @xmath13 band , having mostly @xmath11 character , and is filled throughout most of the sbz . for the mg terminated surface ( _ cf . _",
    "[ fig_gpaw_mg ] ) the @xmath2 state has more @xmath7 character , is separated from the bulk @xmath13 bands although still following the @xmath13 bands through the sbz , is shifted up in energy , and partially emptied . when we directly replace mg by li to model a mg@xmath8 surface , we find that the @xmath2 surface state has mostly mg / li @xmath7 character ( _ cf .",
    "_  fig .",
    "[ fig6](d ) ) , is shifted up in energy between the @xmath13 and mg @xmath7 bulk states , and is almost completely empty . for the relaxed li",
    "terminated surface ( _ cf . _  fig .",
    "[ fig_gpaw_li ] ) the @xmath2 state is nearly emptied , and has significant @xmath7 character , as shown in fig .  [ fig6](d ) .    together",
    ", this suggests that by altering the termination of the mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface , the @xmath2 surface state is changed from a bulk - like state with @xmath11 character for b termination , to an increasingly localized and emptied surface state with more metallic @xmath7 character from mg termination , to mg@xmath48li ( or mg@xmath8 ) termination , and finally the structurally optimized li termination .",
    "this is consistent with previous calculations for the na terminated mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface @xcite , which found the @xmath2 surface state between that calculated here for mg and mg@xmath48li terminations . in effect , by varying the surface termination or electro - chemically doping the surface , one can tune both the localization and energy range of mgb@xmath0(0001 ) @xmath2 surface states .    in this way",
    ", one could then modify the density or fermi velocity of the charge carriers on the surface and consequently surface plasmons dispersions .",
    "this means that surface plasmon characteristics may be tuned rather easily by surface charging or doping .",
    "in this paper we have investigated mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface and subsurface states , and the influence of surface termination ( by b , mg , and li ) and surface charging ( replacing mg by li to model mg@xmath8 ) using both plane wave and real - space _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "generally we find for the mgb@xmath0(0001 ) surface there exist three types of surface states which are often well separated from bulk bands , namely , the b @xmath1 surface band , the @xmath2 supra - surface state band , and the b @xmath3 and @xmath64 qw bands .",
    "if charge is added to the b layer by either changing the surface termination or surface charging , the b @xmath6 surface bands shift shift down in energy .",
    "as these bands cross the bulk b @xmath6 bands , they lose their surface state character due to hybridization . in effect , by adjusting the charging of the b subsurface atomic layer , we may tune both the localization and energy range of the b @xmath6 surface states .    on the other hand , the addition of a mg , mg@xmath8 , or li layer above the b surface layer gives the @xmath2 surface state band an increasingly metallic @xmath7 character as it is emptied .",
    "we find these results are quite robust , and independent of the _ ab initio _ methodology employed ( plane wave or real - space ) and relaxation of the surface .",
    "overall , these results suggest that by changing surface coverage and charging , one may tune both the density and fermi velocity of the charge carriers at the surface .",
    "this would make possible the controlled tuning of the surface plasmon dispersions , e.g. the slope of the acoustic surface plasmon , which may then influence ( modify or enhance ) `` surface '' superconductivity .",
    "this has profound implications for both the superconducting behaviour and surface or acoustic surface plasmon dispersion of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , because of the diversity of mgb@xmath0 s surface electronic structure , with combinations of various types of quasi-2d and 3d plasmas , it seems that the mgb@xmath0 surface should have very unusual dielectric and optical properties . to clarify these unique properties",
    ", our next step will be the investigation of the mgb@xmath0 surface dielectric response .",
