    "the astrid asteroid family is characterized by an unusual distribution in the @xmath9 plane , with a dispersion in inclination of its members at @xmath10  2.764  au much larger than that of members at other semi - major axis .",
    "@xcite recently showed that this feature of the astrid family is caused by its interaction with the @xmath1 nodal secular resonance with ceres .",
    "asteroid crossing this resonance are significantly dispersed in inclination , causing the crab - like appearance of the family .",
    "the unusual distribution in inclination of the astrid family also produces other consequences .",
    "@xcite observed that the current distribution of the @xmath2 component of terminal ejection velocities field computed from inverting gauss equation for this family is characterized by a leptokurtic distribution , i.e. , a distribution with larger tails and more peaked than a gaussian . if we define as kurtosis the ratio of the fourth momenta of a distribution with respect to the fourth power of its standard deviation , that for a distribution of n random variable @xmath11 is given by :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the mean value of the distribution , then pearson @xmath14 kurtosis is equal to k-3 .",
    "gaussian distributions are characterized by values of @xmath14 equal to 0 .",
    "the value of the pearson @xmath14 parameter for the whole astrid family is quite high , but is closer to mesokurtic values if asteroids in the resonant region are excluded .    in this work",
    "we investigate what information on key parameters describing the yarkovsky effect , such as the thermal conductivity of material on the surface and the mass density , can be obtained by studying the orbital diffusion of fictitious members of several simulated astrid families . by checking on what time - scales the current value of @xmath15 can be reached , and for what values of the parameters describing the yarkovsky force , constraints on the allowed range of values of these parameters can be , in principle , obtained .",
    "the independent constraints provided by secular dynamics ( and from the current inclination distribution of astrid members ) could then be used to estimate the age of the astrid family with a higher precision than that available for other families .",
    "as a first step in our analysis we selected the astrid family , as identified in @xcite using the hierarchical clustering method ( hcm , @xcite ) and a cutoff of 60  m / s .",
    "489 members of the astrid dynamical group were identified in that work .",
    "we also selected asteroids in the background of the family , defined as a box in the @xmath16 domain .",
    "we selected asteroids to within the minimum and maximum values of astrid proper elements , plus or minus 0.02 au , 0.02 , and 0.02 in proper @xmath17,@xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively , with the exception of the maximum values in @xmath17 that was given by the semi - major axis of the center of the 5j:-2a mean - motion resonance .",

    "the astrid family is a c - complex family , and c - complex objects dominate the local background : out of 207 bodies with information on geometric albedo , only 5 ( 2.4% of the total ) have @xmath22 , and are possibly associated with a s - complex composition .",
    "no taxonomic or albedo interlopers were identified in the astrid hcm group .",
    "how much the local dynamics is responsible for the current shape of the astrid family ? to answer this question , we obtained dynamical maps in the domain of proper @xmath9 with the method described in @xcite , based on the theory developed by @xcite .",

    "no asteroid was identified in librating states of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath39 resonances .",

    "any family that reached this resonance more than @xmath3 12 myr ago , would have had its members completely dispersed along the separatrix of the @xmath52 resonance , which suggests that astrid resonant members reached this resonance more than 12 myr ago .",
    "the astrid family is the product of a relatively recent collision : @xcite estimate its age to be @xmath54 myr , while @xcite , using a v - shape criteria , estimate the family to be @xmath55 myr old .",
    "monte carlo methods @xcite that simulates the evolution of the family caused by the yarkovsky and yorp effects , where yorp stands for yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievskii - paddack effect , could also be used to obtain estimates of the age and terminal ejection velocities of the family members ( these models will be referred as `` yarko - yorp '' models hereafter ) .",
    "however , the age estimates from these methods depend on key parameters describing the strength of the yarkovsky force , such as the thermal conductivity @xmath56 and bulk and surface density @xmath57 and @xmath58 , that are in many cases poorly known . before attempting our own estimate of the family age and terminal ejection velocity field , here we analyze what constraints could be obtained on the possible values of terminal ejection velocities of the original astrid family from its current inclination distribution .    in the yarko - yorp models ,",
    "fictitious families are generated considering an isotropic velocity field , and assuming that the fragments are dispersed with a gaussian distribution whose standard deviation follows the relationship :    @xmath59    where @xmath8 is the terminal ejection velocity parameter to be estimated , and @xmath60 is the asteroid diameter .",
    "@xcite estimated that the parent body of the astrid family was 42.0 km in diameter , which yields an escape velocity of 33.0 m / s . assuming that the @xmath8 parameter of the terminal ejection velocity field would be in the range @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , as observed for most families in the main belt @xcite , then , expected values of @xmath8 would be in the range from 5 to 50 m / s .",
    "if we only consider objects with @xmath63  au , so as to eliminate the asteroids that interacted with the @xmath1 resonance , then the currently observed minimum and maximum values of @xmath19 of family members are 0.0086 and 0.0148 , respectively . neglecting possible changes in @xmath19 after the family formation , which is motivated by the fact that the local dynamics does not seems to particularly affect asteroids in this region",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : maps_ai ] ) , and will be further investigated later on , these values set constraints on the possible terminal ejection velocity parameter @xmath8 with which the family was created . currently , only 7 objects not members of the family are observed at sines of inclinations lower that 0.016 , i.e. , 1.5% of the current number of family members .",

    "had values of @xmath19 outside the range of values currently observed , while for @xmath66 m / s these number was 55 ( 11.5% of the total ) . based on these considerations , it seems unlikely that the ejection velocity parameter @xmath8 was larger than @xmath67  m / s , or a larger number of asteroids outside the astrid family at @xmath63  au would be visible today .",
    "this implies that @xmath68 was at most 0.76 , excluding larger values associated with more catastrophic events .",
    "@xcite recently investigated the shape of the current distribution of the @xmath2 component of terminal ejection velocity fields and argued that families that were produced with a @xmath8 parameter smaller than the escape velocity from the parent body , are relatively young , and are located in dynamically less active regions , as is the case of the astrid family , should be characterized by a leptokurtic distribution of the @xmath2 component .",
    "this because , assuming that initial ejection velocities followed a gaussian distribution , fragments with initial ejection velocities less than the escape velocity from the parent body would not be able to escape . this would produce a distribution of ejection velocities more peaked and with larger tails than a gaussian one , i.e. , leptokurtic . while the subsequent dynamical evolution would tend to cause the distribution of ejection velocities to be more mesokurtic , this effect would be less intense for families such astrid , that are both relatively young and in dynamically less active regions",
    ".    one would therefore expect astrid to be a relatively leptokurtic family .",
    "however , as also noticed in @xcite , the effect of the @xmath1 secular resonance tend to increase the dispersion in inclination values of the family members , and therefore of @xmath2 .",
    "while the current value of @xmath14 , the parameter associated with the kurtosis of the @xmath2 distribution ( equal to 0 for mesokurtic or gaussian distributions ) of the whole astrid family is quite large , ( @xmath69 ) , if we only consider objects with @xmath63  au that did not interacted with the secular resonance , the value of @xmath14 is just 0.39 , more compatible with a relatively somewhat leptokurtic family .",
    "this shows that most of the leptokurtic shape of the currently observed astrid family is therefore caused by the interaction of its members with the @xmath1 secular resonance .    to investigate what information the @xmath2 component of the terminal ejection velocities",
    "could provide on the initial values of the @xmath8 parameter , we simulated fictitious astrid families with the currently observed size - frequency distribution , values of the parameters affecting the strength of the yarkovsky force typical of c - type asteroids according to @xcite , i.e. , bulk and surface density equal to @xmath70  kg / m@xmath71 , thermal conductivity @xmath72   w / m / k , thermal capacity equal to @xmath73  j / kg / k , bond albedo @xmath74 and infrared emissivity @xmath75 .",

    "[ fig : gamma2 ] displays the time evolution of the @xmath14 parameter of the @xmath2 distribution for the fictitious family with @xmath84 m / s ( panel a ) and 10 m / s ( panel b ) .",
    "the peak in the @xmath14 value occurs when most particles interacted with the @xmath1 secular resonance and had their inclination value increased by this resonance .",
    "the current value of @xmath14 of the astrid family is not reached for any time inside the range of possible ages , as estimated by @xcite ( vertical red lines , the largest range of uncertainty for the age of this family in the literature .",
    "this range of ages corresponds to a 1-standard deviation confidence level , obtained by computing a yarkovsky calibration , with 20% relative uncertainty , and with an assumed density of 1410  kg / m@xmath71 ) , neither for the simulations with @xmath84 m / s nor that with @xmath85 m / s .",
    "the situation is even worse for families with larger values of the ejection parameter , for which the peak in @xmath14 is achieved earlier .",
    "this suggests that standard parameters describing the yarkovsky force may not apply for the astrid family .",
    "@xcite analyzed the effect that changing the values of the yarkovsky parameters had on estimate of the family age , and found that the largest effect was associated with changes in the values of the thermal conductivity and bulk and surface density of asteroids , in that order .",
    "based on these results , we first considered two other possible values of @xmath56 , 0.001 and 0.100 w / m / k , and repeated our simulations for @xmath85  m / s .",

    "this suggests that @xmath56 = 0.001 w / m / k could be closer to the actual value of thermal conductivity of the real astrid asteroids .",
    "we then considered the effect of changing the bulk and surface density , assumed equal , for simplicity .",
    "we used for the two sets of simulations @xmath87 kg / m@xmath71 and @xmath88 kg / m@xmath71 , that are at the extreme of the range of values for the density of c - type asteroids @xcite .",
    "the other parameters were equal to previous values , and @xmath56 = 0.001 w / m / k .",
    "[ fig : gamma2_k_rho ] , panels c and d , displays our results . while the values of @xmath14 for the first simulation , do not reach the current value in the time interval covering the uncertainty associated with astrid age , larger values of the density could be still compatible with our @xmath14 test .",
    "overall , our results suggest that the thermal conductivity @xmath56 of astrid members should be of the order of @xmath56 = 0.001 w / m / k , while the mean density of astrid fragments should be higher than 1000 kg / m@xmath71 .",
    "remarkably , results obtained with the @xmath89 method are in good agreement with those obtained from independent methods @xcite .",
    "now that the analysis of the current inclination distribution and our @xmath14 test provided independent constraint on the values of the @xmath8 parameter and of the thermal conductivity and density of astrid members , we can try to obtain an independent age estimate for this family .",
    "we use the approach described in @xcite that employs a monte carlo method @xcite to estimate the age and terminal ejection velocities of the family members .",
    "more details on the method can be found in @xcite .",
    "essentially , the semi - major axis distribution of simulated asteroid families is evolved under the influence of the yarkovsky effect ( both diurnal and seasonal version ) , the stochastic yorp force , and changes in values of the past solar luminosity .",

    "<S> the peculiar orbital configuration of the astrid family can be used to set constraints on key parameters describing the strength of the yarkovsky force , such as the bulk and surface density and the thermal conductivity of surface material . by simulating various fictitious families with different values of these parameters , and by demanding that the current value of the kurtosis of the distribution in @xmath2 be reached over the estimated lifetime of the family </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained that the thermal conductivity of astrid family members should be @xmath3 0.001 w / m / k , and that the surface and bulk density should be higher than 1000 kg / m@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo methods simulating yarkovsky and stochastic yorp evolution of the astrid family show its age to be @xmath5 = 140@xmath630 myr old , in good agreement with estimates from other groups . </S>",
    "<S> its terminal ejection velocity parameter is in the range @xmath7  m / s . </S>",
    "<S> values of @xmath8 larger than 25 m / s are excluded from constraints from the current inclination distribution .    </S>",
