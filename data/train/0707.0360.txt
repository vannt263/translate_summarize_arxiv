    "since the observation of martensitic transformations in ni - mn based heusler alloys @xcite , and the later discovery of the magnetic shape memory effect ( msm ) in ni - mn - ga @xcite , there has been growing interest in the magneto - mechanical properties of ni - mn-@xmath0 systems ( @xmath0 : group iiia - va elements ) @xcite .",
    "martensitic transformations in these systems are found roughly in a valence electron concentration range of @xmath5 electrons per atom .",
    "next to the msm effect , large magnetocaloric effects ( mce ) have been reported in the vicinity of the martensitic transformation in ni - mn - ga @xcite and other ni - mn - based heusler alloys such as ni - mn - sn and ni - mn - in @xcite .",
    "the mce in these systems relies on the large and rapid temperature variation in the magnetic interaction around the martensitic transition .",
    "furthermore , the mce in ni - mn - based heuslers is usually `` inverse , '' i.e. , the alloy cools on applying a magnetic field adiabatically instead of heating @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the inverse mce is about 20 j kg@xmath4k@xmath4 for 5 t in ni@xmath1mn@xmath2sn@xmath3 being comparable with those of giant mce material @xcite .",
    "the use of normal and inverse mce materials in the form of composites can affect the heat transfer efficiency favorably in heating or cooling units based on the mce .    to understand the influence of introducing small amounts of transition elements on the size of the mce in ni@xmath1mn@xmath2sn@xmath3",
    ", we have investigated the entropy change around the martensitic transition of ( ni , co)@xmath1mn@xmath2sn@xmath3 and ( ni , fe)@xmath1mn@xmath2sn@xmath3 , in which ni was replaced by fe and co , each in amounts of 1 at% and 3 at% .",
    "higher concentrations of fe and co lead nearly to the complete suppression of the martensitic state .",
    "the entropy change was determined from field dependent magnetization measurements .",
    "ingots of about 3 g were prepared by arc melting pure metals under argon atmosphere in a water cooled cu crucible .",
    "the ingots were then encapsulated under argon atmosphere in quartz glass and annealed at 1273 k for 2 hours .",
    "afterwards , they were quenched in ice - water .",
    "the compositions of the alloys were determined by energy dispersive x - ray photoluminescence analysis ( edx ) and are given in at% in table [ tab : composition ] . the valence electron concentrations @xmath6",
    "are also given in the table .",
    "this is calculated as the concentration weighted sum of the number of 3@xmath7 and 4@xmath8 electrons of ni and mn and the number of 4@xmath8 and 4@xmath9 electrons of sn .",
    "an estimated error of @xmath10% in determining the concentration leads to an error of @xmath11 in the value of @xmath6 .",

    "the sample containing no fe or co is referred to as reference. [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     polycrystalline samples were cut from the ingots using a low speed diamond saw and used as samples for magnetization and calorimetric studies . for differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) measurements , one side of the samples were ground with 1200 grid sic abrasive to insure proper thermal contact .",
    "calorimetric measurements were carried out in the temperature range 100 k@xmath12 350 k. typical heating and cooling rates were 0.5 k min@xmath4 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetization @xmath13 was measured in magnetic fields @xmath14 of 5 mt and 5 t in the temperature range 5 k @xmath15 k using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer . prior to the measurements ,",
    "the samples were prepared in a zero - field - cooled state ( zfc ) by cooling it from 380 k to 5 k in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "subsequently , an external field was applied , and the data were taken on increasing temperature up to 380 k. then , without removing the external field , the data were taken on decreasing temperature , giving the field - cooled ( fc ) branch . as a last step , again without removing the external field , the magnetization was measured on increasing temperature . the last step is denoted as the field - heated ( fh ) sequence .",
    "any hysteresis in the fc and fh sequences is expected to be associated with a structural transition , whereas any splitting of the zfc and fh curves is expected to be associated with pinning due to antiferromagnetic ( af ) or noncollinear magnetic structures existing within the ferromagnetic ( fm ) matrix .",
    "such structures can reside within twin boundaries if the system is martensitic .",
    "the results of the calorimetric experiments are collected in fig .",
    "1 . next to the features associated with",
    "the martensite start @xmath16 , martensite finish @xmath17 , austenite start @xmath18 , and austenite finish @xmath19 temperatures , features associated with the curie temperature of the austenitic state @xmath20 are also observed . for co1 ,",

    "all samples order ferromagnetically in the austenitic state below @xmath20 .",
    "with respect to @xmath20=311 k of the reference alloy , @xmath20 increases with increasing fe and co concentrations , whereby the increase is more significant for the case of co ( tab .",

    "an additional feature within the transition region is observed , which is indicative of an intermartensitic transition .",

    "the spin system is in a frozen state . on heating ,",
    "@xmath13 remains constant up to about 100 k in all samples . at this temperature ,",
    "the thermal energy begins to overcome the exchange anisotropy of the frozen state in the 5 mt measuring field , and the magnetization begins to increase . at a slightly higher temperature ,",
    "the rate of increase slows down , and eventually , the zfc and fh curves merge .",
    "this occurs at a temperature between @xmath18 and @xmath19 as the proportion of the austenitic phase increases , and along with it , ferromagnetic exchange gains strength .",
    "@xmath13 measured in 5 t is shown in fig .",
    "a difference in the zfc and fh @xmath13 curves no longer exist in this field , and zfc data are omitted .",
    "however , a hysteresis is still present in the fc and fh curves for all samples .",
    "the hysteresis narrows with increasing co content , while it becomes broader with increasing fe content . the temperature corresponding to the peak in the fc-@xmath13 curve shifts to lower values with respect to @xmath16 found from the data in fig .",
    "the shift is about 10 k for the co1 sample and 20 - 30 k for the other samples .",
    "for all samples , the magnetization drops as the structure transforms from austenite to martensite .",
    "this drop can be related to the fact that in mn - based heusler systems , the exchange interaction strongly depends on the mn - mn distance , and any change in the distance caused by a change in the crystal structure can modify the interactions and introduce antiferromagnetic exchange .",
    "this has been shown to be the case for a ni@xmath1mn@xmath35sn@xmath36 alloy , in which short range antiferromagnetic exchange was found to be present between mn atoms located at the 4(b ) positions of the austenite phase and that the exchange strengthens in the martensitic state @xcite .      to determine the size of the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) in the vicinity of the transition we use the maxwell relation    @xmath37    from which the mce can be estimated numerically from @xmath38 isotherms .",
    "the @xmath38 curves for the samples in the temperature range of their respective structural transition temperatures are given in figs .",
    "the curves are obtained on increasing field and decreasing temperature as indicated by the arrows .",
    "the sequence of measurements shown with open circles ( red ) shows an increase in @xmath38 with decreasing temperature down to @xmath16 for all samples .",
    "the behavior reverses below @xmath16 . for fe1 , fe3 , and co1",
    ", @xmath38 increases steadily up to 5 t without any major feature . for co3",
    ", there is a tendency for a metamagnetic - like transition for temperatures below @xmath16 as can be seen from the development of an upturn of the data with increasing field at an inflection point around 2@xmath303 t. this feature is expected to be due to the onset of a field induced transition from the martensitic to the austenitic state , which is the state of higher magnetization .",
    "the observability of this effect only in the co3 sample is because , the shift in @xmath16 to lower temperatures in the applied fields in these experiments exceeds the width of the hysteresis in @xmath13 ( fig .",

    "1 . for this particular concentration",
    ", a large @xmath40 can be found to lie in the large spacing of the magnetization isotherms in fig .",
    "two additional peaks in @xmath39 appear for the co3 sample around 240 k and 260 k. these are expected to be related to the step - like features observed below @xmath16 in the @xmath13 data ( fig .",
