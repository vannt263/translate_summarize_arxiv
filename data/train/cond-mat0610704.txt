    "a classical non - linear dynamical system , when driven to a point of instability , will undergo a bifurcation , where the system evolves toward distinctly different final states . at bifurcation the system becomes very sensitive and the smallest fluctuation can determine the evolution of a massive system with huge potential energy .",
    "this property of infinite sensitivity at the point of instability can be used to amplify very weak signals , and has recently been the focus of investigation in the design of quantum detectors to readout the state of quantum bits ( qubits ) built from josephson junction ( jj ) circuits . here",
    "we examine in experiment and theory a pulse and hold strategy for rapid switching of a jj circuit which is quickly brought near a point of instability , pointing out several important properties for an ideal detector .",
    "we focus on switching in a circuit with overdamped phase dynamics at high frequencies , and underdamped at low frequencies .",
    "this hf - overdamped case is relevant to experiments on small capacitance jjs biased with typical measurement leads .",
    "classical jjs have strongly non - linear electrodynamics and they have served as a model system in non - linear physics for the last 40 years . more recently it has been shown that jj circuits with small capacitance can also exhibit quantum dynamics when properly measured at low enough temperatures",
    ". experimental demonstration of the macroscopic quantum dynamics in these circuits has relied on efficient quantum measurement strategies , characterized by high single shot sensitivity with rapid reset time and low back action .",
    "some of these measurement or detection methods are based on the switching of a jj circuit from the zero voltage state to a finite voltage state .",
    "@xcite other detection methods are based on a dispersive technique , where a high frequency signal probes the phase dynamics of a qubit .",
    "these dispersive methods have achieved the desired sensitivity at considerably higher speeds than the static switching methods , allowing individual quantum measurements to be made with much higher duty cycle .",
    "in particular , the dispersive methods have shown that it is possible to continuously monitor the qubit.@xcite however , for both static switching and dispersive methods , the sensitivity of the technique is improved by exploiting the non - linear properties of the readout circuit in a pulse and hold measurement strategy .",
    "this improved sensitivity of the pulse and hold method is not surprising , because when properly designed , the pulse and hold technique will exploit the infinite sensitivity of a non - linear system at the point of instability .",
    "the general idea of exploiting the infinite sensitivity at an instable point is a recurrent theme in applications of non - linear dynamics .",
    "the basic idea has been used since the early days of microwave engineering in the well - known parametric amplifier@xcite which has infinite gain at the point of dynamical instability .",
    "the unstable point can be conveniently represented as a saddle point for the phase space trajectories of the non - linear dynamical system . in the pulse and",
    "hold measurement method an initial fast pulse is used to quickly bring the system to the saddle point for a particular hold bias level .",
    "the hold level is chosen so that the phase space topology favors a rapid separation in to the two basins of attraction in the phase space .",
    "the initial pulse should be not so fast that it will cause excessive back action on the qubit , but not so slow that it s duration exceeds the relaxation time of the qubit .",
    "the length of the hold pulse is that which is required to achieve a signal to noise ratio necessary for unambiguous determination of the resulting basin of attraction . in practice",
    "this length is set by the filters and amplifiers in the second stage of the quantum measurement system .    in this paper",
    "we discuss pulse and hold detection in the context of switching from the zero voltage state to the finite voltage state of a jj .",
    "we give an overview of such switching in jjs , focusing on the hf - overdamped case .",
    "switching detectors with overdamped high frequency phase dynamics are different from all other qubit measurement strategies implemented thus far , where underdamped phase dynamics has been used .",
    "however , the hf - overdamped case is quite relevant to a large number of experiments which measure switching in low capacitance jjs with small critical currents.@xcite we show that by making the damping at high frequencies large enough , a favorable phase space topology for switching can be achieved.@xcite in this overdamped situation the external phase can be treated classically and contributions of macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) to the switching probability can be neglected , in contrast to the underdamped case.@xcite experimental results are shown where on - chip rc damping circuits are used to create an hf - overdamped environment .",
    "we observe that for longer pulses of duration 20 s , the switching process is initiated by thermal fluctuations in the overdamped system and thermal equilibrium is achieved at the base temperature of the cryostat ( 25 mk ) .",
    "for short pulses of duration @xmath0  ns , the switching is unaffected by thermal fluctuations up to a temperature of 500 mk , and the width of the switching distribution at low temperatures is rather determined by random variations in the repeated switch pulse . although the detector apparently had the speed and sensitivity required for making a quantum measurement , we were unfortunately unable to demonstrate quantum dynamics of the qubit due to problems with fluctuating background charges .",
    "the non - linear dynamics of a dc - driven jj can be pictorially represented in a phase space portrait .",
    "we begin by examining the phase space portraits of the resistive and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) , which is the simplest model from which we can gain intuitive understanding of the non - linear dynamics .",
    "the rcsj model consists of an ideal josephson element of critical current @xmath1 biased at the current level @xmath2 , which is shunted by the parallel plate capacitance of the tunnel junction , @xmath3 and a resistor @xmath4 , which models the damping at all frequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ washboard](a ) ) .",
    "the circuit parameters define the two quantities @xmath5 called the plasma frequency , and the quality factor @xmath6 .",
    "the dynamics is classified as overdamped or underdamped for @xmath7 or @xmath8 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath9 is the reduced flux quantum .",
    "the circuit dynamics can be visualized by the motion of a particle of mass @xmath10 in a tilted washboard potential @xmath11 subjected to the damping force @xmath12 , where the particle position corresponds to the phase difference @xmath13 across the junction and the tilt @xmath14 is the applied current normalized by the critical current , @xmath15 ( see fig  [ phasespace1](a ) ) .",
    "below the critical tilt @xmath16 the fictitious particle will stay in a local minimum of the washboard potential ( marked a in fig  [ phasespace1](a ) ) corresponding to the superconducting state where @xmath17 .",
    "increasing the tilt of the potential to @xmath18 , where local minima no longer exist , the particle will start to accelerate to a finite velocity @xmath19 determined by the damping .",
    "if the tilt is then decreased below @xmath16 , the particle for an underdamped jj ( @xmath8 ) will keep on moving due to inertia . further decreasing the tilt below the level @xmath20 , where loss per cycle from damping exceeds gain due to inertia , the particle will be retrapped in a local minimum . in terms of the current - voltage characteristic",
    ", this corresponds to hysteresis , or a coexistence of two stable states , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for a bias fixed in the region @xmath23 . for the overdamped rcsj model the particle",
    "will always be trapped in a local minimum for @xmath24 and freely evolving down the potential for @xmath18 and there is no coexistence of two stable states .",
    "a phase space portrait@xcite of the rcsj model is shown in fig .",
    "[ phasespace1](b ) .",
    "this portrait shows trajectories that the particle would follow in the space of coordinate ( @xmath13 ) versus velocity ( @xmath25 ) for a few chosen initial conditions .",
    "the topology of the phase space portrait is characterized by several distinct features .",
    "fix point attractors marked `` a '' in fig .",
    "[ phasespace1 ] correspond to the particle resting in a local minimum of the washboard potential , and the saddle points marked `` s '' corresponds to the particle resting in an unstable state at the top of the potential barrier ( compare with fig .",
    "[ phasespace1](a ) ) .",
    "two trajectories surrounding a and ending at s are the unstable trajectories which define the boundary of a basin of attraction : all initial conditions within this boundary will follow a trajectory leading to a. we call this the 0-basin of attraction .",
    "the thick line b is a stable limiting cycle , corresponding to a free - running state of the phase @xmath13 , where the circuit is undergoing josephson oscillations with frequency @xmath26 .",
    "all trajectories leading to the limiting cycle b start in the 1-basin of attraction , which is the region outside the 0-basins .",
    "the existence of two basins of attraction in the phase space topology , and in particular the clear separation of all 0-basins by the 1-basin , make the underdamped rcsj circuit ( @xmath8 ) appropriate for a switching current detector , as we discuss below .",
    "for the overdamped rcsj circuit ( @xmath7 ) attractors a and b do not coexist for any fixed bias condition , and it therefore can not be used for a switching current detector .",
    "however , the rcsj model is not always the most realistic model for the dynamics of jj circuits , as the damping in real experiments is usually frequency dependent , and in the case of small capacitance jjs , this frequency dependence can very much change the character of the damping .    .",

    "if we model the leads as a transmission line , the high frequency impedance would correspond to a damping resistance of the order of free space impedance @xmath29 . with the small capacitance of a typical jj as used in present experiments , this damping inevitably leads to overdamped dynamics @xmath7 .",
    "it should be noted that for small capacitance jjs , underdamped phase dynamics is hard to achieve in practice as high impedance all the way up to the plasma frequency is desired , and this requires an engineering effort where the high impedance leads need to be constructed very close to the junction .",

    "an initial condition which is infinitesimally below or above c will eventually end up either in an attractor a , or on b respectively . in fig .",
    "[ phasespace1](c ) we also see that the boundaries of the 0-basins are directly touching one another as a consequence of the existence of c. thus , it is possible to have a trajectory from one 0-basin to another 0-basin , without crossing the 1- basin .",

    "the transition from the 0-basin to the 1-basin , called switching , can be used as a very sensitive detector .",
    "the idea here is to choose a `` hold '' bias level and circuit parameters where the phase space portrait has a favorable topology such as that shown in figs .",
    "[ phasespace1](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "a rapid `` switch pulse '' is applied to the circuit bringing the system from a to a point as close as possible to the unstable point s. balanced at this unstable point , the circuit will be very sensitive to any external noise , or to the state of a qubit coupled to the circuit .",
    "the qubit state at the end of the switch pulse can be thought of as determining the initial condition , placing the fictitious phase particle on either side of the basin boundary , from which the particle will evolve to the respective attractor .",
    "the speed and accuracy of the measurement will depend on how rapidly the particle evolves away from the unstable point s , far enough in to the 0-basin or 1-basin such that external noise can not drive the system to the other basin . from this discussion it is clear that a phase space portrait with the topology shown in fig .  [",
    "phasespace1](c ) is not favorable for a switching current detector . here",
    "the switching corresponds to crossing the unstable cycle c. initial conditions which are infinitesimally close to c will remain close to c over many cycles of the phase , and thus a small amount of noise can kick the system back and forth between the 0-basins and the 1-basin , leading to a longer measurement time and increased number of errors .",
    "the _ measurement time _ is that time which is required for the actual switching process to occur and must be shorter than the relaxation time of the qubit . in the ideal case",
    "the measurement time would be the same as the duration of the switch pulse .",
    "a much longer time may be required to actually determine which basin the system has chosen .",
    "this longer _ detection time _ is the duration of the hold level needed to reach a signal to noise ratio larger than 1 , which is in practice determine by the bandwidth of the low - noise amplifier and filters in the second stage of the circuit . in our experiments described in the following sections , we used a low noise amplifier mounted at the top of the cryostat which has a very limited bandwidth and high input impedance . while this amplifier has very low back action on the qubit circuit ( very low current noise ) , it s low bandwidth increases the detection time such that individual measurements can be acquired only at @xmath48  khz repetition rate . since many measurements ( @xmath49 )",
    "are required to get good statistics when measuring probabilities , the acquisition time window is some 0.5 seconds and the low frequency noise ( drift or @xmath50 noise ) in the biasing circuit will thus play a role in the detector accuracy .",
    "the measurement time of a switching detector will depend on fluctuations or noise in the circuit .",
    "the phase space portraits display the dissipative trajectories of a dynamical system , but they do not contain any information about the fluctuations which necessarily accompany dissipation . for a switching current detector , we desire that these fluctuations be as small as possible , and therefore the dissipative elements should be kept at as low a temperature as possible . analyzing the switching current detector circuit with a thermal equilibrium model , we can calculate the rate of escape from the attractor a. this equilibrium escape rate however only sets an upper limit on the measurement time .",
    "when we apply the switch pulse , the goal is to bring the circuit out of equilibrium , and we desire that the sensitivity at the unstable point be large enough so that the measurement is made before equilibrium is achieved ( i.e. before thermal fluctuations drive the switching process ) .",
    "equilibrium fluctuations can cause a jj circuit to jump out of it s basin of attraction in a process know as thermal escape .",
    "the random force which gives rise to the escape trajectory will most likely take the system through the saddle point s , because such a trajectory would require a minimum of energy from the noise source .",
    "@xcite for the topology of phase space portraits shown in figs .  [ phasespace1](b ) and ( d )",
    ", thermal escape will result in a switching from a 0-basin to the 1-basin , with negligible probability of a `` retrapping '' event bringing the system back from the 1-basin to a 0-basin .",
    "however , for the topology of fig .",
    "[ phasespace1](c ) , thermal escape through the saddle point leads to another 0-basin , and thus the particle is immediately retrapped in the next minimum of the washboard potential .",
    "this process of successive escape and retrapping is know as phase diffusion , and it s signature is a non - zero dc voltage across the jj circuit when biased below the critical current , @xmath51 .    phase diffusion can occur in the overdamped rcsj model , or in the hf - overdamped model when parameters result in a phase space topology of fig .",
    "[ phasespace1](c ) . in the latter case ,",
    "a switching process can be identified which corresponds to the escape from a phase diffusive state to the free running state , or to crossing the unstable limiting cycle c in fig .",
    "[ phasespace1](c ) which marks the boundary between the phase diffusive region and the 1-basin .",
    "this basin boundary c is formed by the convergence of many trajectories leading to different s , and the escape process of crossing this boundary is fundamentally different than escape from a 0-basin to the 1-basin .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite of switching in jjs with such a phase space topology show that escape over the unstable boundary c is characterized by late switching events , which arise because even a small amount of noise near this boundary can kick the system back and forth between the 1-basin and the many 0-basins for a long time before there is an actual escape leading to the limiting cycle b.    the rate of thermal escape from a 0-basin can be calculated using kramers formula @xcite @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the depth of the potential well from a to s , @xmath54 boltzmann s constant and @xmath55 the temperature .",
    "the prefactor @xmath56 is called the attempt frequency , where @xmath57 is a factor which depends on the damping .",
    "analytical results for @xmath58 were found by kramers in the two limiting cases of underdamped ( @xmath8 ) and overdamped ( @xmath7 ) dynamics .",
    "for the application of kramers escape theory we require that @xmath59 , i.e. thermal escape is rare , so that each escape event is from a thermal equilibrium situation . the fluctuations in thermal equilibrium are completely uncorrelated in time , which is to say that the strength of the fluctuations are frequency independent ( white noise ) .",
    "furthermore , the kramers formula assumes absorbing boundary conditions , where the escape process which leads to a change of the basin of attraction has zero probability of return .",
    "these conditions restrict the direct application of kramers formula in describing switching in jj circuits@xcite to the case of the underdamped rcsj model such as that depicted in fig .",
    "[ phasespace1](b ) . in principle",
    "one could apply kramers formula to the overdamped rcsj model , where the escape is from one well to the next well ( switching between adjacent attractors a ) , but experiments thus far are unable to measure a single @xmath60 jump of the phase , as this corresponds to an extremely small change in circuit energy .",
    "thermal induced switching of small capacitance josephson junctions which experience frequency dependent damping as modeled by the circuit of fig .",
    "[ washboard](b ) , was analyzed in experiment and theory by the quantronics group @xcite who generalized kramers result .",
    "the theoretical analysis was subject to the constraint that the dynamics of the voltage across the shunt capacitor @xmath41 is underdamped ( i.e. the quality factor @xmath61 where @xmath35 is the parallel resistance of @xmath33 and @xmath31 ) so that the dynamics of @xmath41 is subject to the fast - time average effects of the fluctuating phase @xmath13 . separating timescales in this way , the switching of @xmath41",
    "could then be regarded as an escape out of a meta - potential , @xmath62 , formed by the averaged fluctuating force in the tilted washboard potential @xmath63 .",
    "assuming non - absorbing boundary conditions , this `` escape over a dissipation barrier '' can be written as a generalization of kramers formula @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the position - dependent diffusion constant , and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 stand for the bottom and the top of the effective barrier , respectively .",
    "detailed expressions can be found in refs.@xcite    in section  [ analysis ] , we use these escape rate formulas to analyze pulse and hold switching measurements .",

    "the critical current @xmath118  na is not the bare critical current @xmath119  na since the quantronium was biased at a magnetic field such that a persistent current of @xmath30  na was flowing in the loop .",

    "this low value of @xmath121 at low temperatures is not unreasonable , as circuit simulations with the nominal value of 10 nf showed that the initial pulse would not exceed the hold level , which clearly is not possible because excellent latching of the circuit was observed .    from the experimental and simulated s - curves , we define the switching current of the sample as the pulse amplitude that gives 50 % switching @xmath124 and the resolution",

    "a comparison of experimental and theoretical @xmath86 vs. @xmath55 and @xmath126 vs. @xmath55 is shown in fig .",
    "[ ioveri0 ] .",
    "we see that the experimental data for the long pulses ( points marked by an x ) are in reasonably good agreement with the simulated values when the theory of switching in an environment with frequency dependent damping is used ( escape from a meta - potential , equation [ overdampedescape ] ) which is plotted as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ ioveri0](a ) .",
    "we note that for the 20  s pulses , escape occurs at bias currents @xmath127 , where the phase space has a topology as shown in figure [ phasespace1](d ) .",
    "hence we can neglect phase diffusion and escape is from a saddle point , so that the non - absorbing boundary condition assumed in the theory is valid . for comparison",
    ", we use the overdamped kramers formula ( equation [ kramers ] ) to simulate the s - curve and calculate @xmath86 and @xmath128 , which is shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ ioveri0 ] . here",
    "the prefactor @xmath129 is given in ref.@xcite and we have used the high frequency quality factor @xmath130 as determined by the resistor @xmath31 only .",
    "we see that the kramers formula overestimates @xmath86 by some 25% ( fig .",
    "[ ioveri0](a ) ) and is worse than the simulation based on eqn .",
    "[ overdampedescape ] , in reproducing the temperature dependence of @xmath128 ( fig .",
    "[ ioveri0](b ) ) . in fact",
    ", the experimental data for the @xmath131  s pulses only shows a weak increase in @xmath128 over the temperature range studied , whereas both theoretical curves predict a slight increase in @xmath128 .",
    "thus an equilibrium thermal escape model explains the data for long , 20 s pulses reasonably well and the data is better explained by the theory of escape with frequency dependent damping , than by the simpler theory embodied in the overdamped kramers formula .",
    "however the correspondence with the former theory is not perfect .",
    "we may explain these deviations as being due to the fact that the quality factor @xmath132 ( see section  [ fluctuations ] ) does not really satisfy the condition for validity of the theory , @xmath133 .",
    "experimental data for the short pulses of duration @xmath74  ns generated by the capacitive bias method is plotted in fig .",
    "[ ioveri0 ] as circles . here",
    "we see that the value of @xmath86 is constant in the temperature range studied , indicating that escape is not from a thermal equilibrium state . for the ideal phase space topology ,",
    "as shown in figure [ phasespace1](d ) , the initial pulse would bring the phase particle arbitrarily close to the saddle point s for the hold bias level .",
    "if the separation in to the basins of attraction occurs before thermal equilibrium can be established , we would not expect temperature dependence of @xmath86 . in this case",
    ", the width of the switching distribution will be determined not by thermal fluctuations , but by other sources of noise , such as random variation in the height of the switch pulse .",
    "these variations are significant because the 1/f noise from the waveform generator must be taken in to account when generating the train of pulses over the time window of the measurement which was about 0.5 sec . in our experiments however , we may not have achieved a constant hold level since the voltage ramp from the waveform generator is not perfectly smooth . knowing the bias capacitor we can calculate an average hold level of @xmath134 , somewhat lower than the critical value of @xmath135 necessary to achieve the phase space topology of figure [ phasespace1](d ) .",
    "nevertheless , we observe excellent latching of the circuit for these 25  ns switch pulses .",
    "we conclude that the observed temperature independence of @xmath86 , and the fact that @xmath86 exceeds @xmath1 by 20% is consistent with a very rapid switching of the junction .",
    "we can rule out excessive thermal noise as a reason for the temperature independent value of @xmath86 for the short pulses . by measuring the gate voltage dependence of @xmath86 as a function of the temperature , a clear transition from @xmath136 to @xmath137 periodicity",
    "was observed in the temperature range 250 mk to 300 mk . for the size of the superconducting island used in this experiment , we can estimate a crossover temperature @xmath138   mk , above which the free energy difference between even and odd parity goes to zero.@xcite hence , we know that the sample is in equilibrium with the thermometer below @xmath139 , and therefore heating effects that might occur in the short pulse experiments , can not explain the fact that the observed @xmath86 is independent of temperature .",
    "thus we have achieved a very rapid , 25 ns measurement time of the switching current , which should be sufficient for measurement of the quantum state of a quantronium circuit . for qubit readout , not only the measurement time is important , but also the resolution of the detector .",
    "for the 25 ns pulse , we obtained the resolution of @xmath140 , or @xmath141 na .",
    "this implies that single shot readout is possible for a quantronium with parameters @xmath142  k and @xmath143 where the switching current of the two qubit states at the optimal readout point differ by 9.6  na .",
    "numerous experiments were made with microwave pulses and continuous microwave radiation to try and find the qubit resonance .",
    "however , due in part to uncertainty in the qubit circuit parameters ( level separation ) and in part to jumps in background charge , no qubit resonance was detected in these experiments .",

    "fast and sensitive measurement of the switching current can be achieved with a pulse - and - hold measurement method , where an initial switch pulse brings the jj circuit close to an unstable point in the phase space of the circuit biased at the hold level .",
    "this technique exploits the infinite sensitivity of a non - linear dynamical system at a point of bifurcation , a common theme in many successful jj qubit detectors .",
    "we have shown that with properly designed frequency dependent damping , fast switching can be achieved even when the high frequency dynamics of the jj circuit are overdamped . with an on - chip rc damping circuit ,",
