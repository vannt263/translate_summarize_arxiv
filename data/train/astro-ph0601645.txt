    "the origin of the stable magnesium isotopes , mg , mg and mg , is of particular interest to astrophysics because mg is one of the few elements for which we can obtain isotopic information from stellar spectroscopy .",
    "the ratio mg : mg : mg has been derived from high - resolution spectra of cool dwarfs and giants in the thin and thick disk of the galaxy @xcite , and for giants stars in the globular cluster ( gc ) ngc 6752 @xcite .",
    "these observations show that many of the stars , including relatively metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ) , have non - solar mg isotopic ratios with enhancements in the neutron - rich isotopes , mg and mg , compared to what is expected from galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models .",
    "the main stellar nucleosynthesis site for all three stable isotopes is hydrostatic burning in the carbon and neon shells of massive stars that explode as type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "the abundances of the neutron - rich mg isotopes are further enhanced by secondary @xmath5-capture processes operating in the helium shell .",
    "the amount of mg produced does not strongly depend on the initial metallicity of the model and is an example of primary nucleosynthesis , whereas secondary production requires some heavier seed nuclei to be present , and the amount produced scales with @xmath6 . ] , whereas the amounts of mg and mg produced scale with the initial metallicity of the star .",
    "this means that the mg content of the ejecta of low metallicity supernovae will be mostly mg with very little mg and mg produced , with typical ratios mg : mg : mg @xmath7 99.0:0.50:0.50 from a 25@xmath8 supernova model with metallicity @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that gce models using ejecta from massive stars match the observational data well for [ fe / h ] @xmath10 but severely underestimate mg / mg at lower metallicities @xcite , indicating that another production site for the neutron - rich mg isotopes at low metallicities is required to account for the observations .",
    "recently , @xcite included the predicted stellar yields of mg and mg from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite along with yields from type ii supernovae @xcite into a gce model of the solar neighborhood .",
    "the gce model with the agb contribution could successfully match the mg isotopic ratios of the metal - poor galactic disk stars while the model without an agb contribution could not .",
    "this result indicates that low - metallicity intermediate mass agb stars may play an important role in the production of these species in galaxies and stellar systems .",
    "the production of the neutron - rich isotopes in agb stars is also of interest in relation to the non - solar mg isotopic ratios observed in giant stars in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the non - solar mg isotopic ratios observed in ngc 6752 have been attributed to agb stars , but @xcite used a gce model with tailor made agb yields from @xcite and failed to match the abundance patterns observed in stars in that cluster .",
    "as @xcite have pointed out , there are still many uncertainties that effect the stellar yields , so an agb solution to the globular cluster anomalies can not be ruled out at present .",
    "further motivation for the study of the production of the mg isotopes in agb stars is given by their relevance in the important current debate on the apparent variation of the fine - structure constant @xcite , and the origin of pre - solar spinel grains , some of which show enhancements in both mg and mg compared to solar @xcite .",
    "briefly , intermediate - mass stars ( initial mass @xmath114 to 8@xmath8 ) will enter the thermally - pulsing phase with a hydrogen ( h)-exhausted core mass ( hereafter core mass ) @xmath12 0.8@xmath8 , after experiencing the second dredge - up ( sdu ) @xcite .",
    "the sdu brings the products of h - burning to the stellar surface ( mostly he and n ) , and will slightly alter the composition of the mg isotopic ratios , with an enrichment in mg at the expense of mg . for the massive , @xmath13 models ,",
    "the sdu is the first time the surface abundances are altered , because there is essentially no first giant branch phase @xcite .",
    "following the sdu , the he - burning shell becomes thermally unstable and flashes every few thousand years or so .",
    "the energy from the thermal pulse ( tp ) drives a convective pocket in the he - rich intershell , which thoroughly mixes the products of he - nucleosynthesis within this region .",
    "following the tp , the convective envelope moves inward in mass and may reach the region previously mixed by the flash - driven convective pocket .",
    "this mixing event is known as the third dredge - up ( tdu ) and if it occurs , is responsible for enriching the envelope in material from the h - exhausted core . following the tdu the star contracts and",
    "the h - shell is re - ignited and provides nearly all of the surface luminosity for the next interpulse period .",
    "the thermal pulse  tdu  interpulse cycle may occur many times during the tp - agb phase ; how many times depends on a number of factors including the convective model which determines the surface luminosity and mass - loss rate and hence the total agb lifetime @xcite .",
    "hot bottom burning can also occur when the base of the convective envelope becomes hot enough to sustain proton - capture nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "if temperature at the base of the envelope is sufficiently hot ( over @xmath14k ) , the nena and mgal chains may operate alongside the cno cycle ; li production is also possible via the cameron - fowler mechanism @xcite , which operates at lower temperatures ( typically @xmath15k ) .",
    "@xcite noted that intermediate - mass agb stars may become luminous , optically obscured carbon stars near the end of the tp - agb , when mass loss has removed much of the envelope , extinguishing hbb but allowing dredge - up to continue .",
    "@xcite described in detail the various nucleosynthesis processes that alter the mg isotopic ratios in agb stars . to summarize , mg and mg are synthesized in the he - shell during thermal pulses by the reactions ne(@xmath16)mg and ne(@xmath17)mg , when the temperature exceeds about 300@xmath18k .",
    "the amount of mg produced depends on the thermodynamic conditions inside the pulse as well as on the composition of the intershell , which will have been altered by previous h and he - burning .",
    "neutron captures , in particular the mg(@xmath19)mg reaction , can also alter the mg isotopic ratio in the intershell , where the neutrons come from the ne(@xmath20)mg reaction @xcite .",
    "hbb can also significantly alter the surface mg isotopic ratio via the activation of the mgal chain , which can result in the destruction of mg if the temperature exceeds @xmath21k .",
    "the stellar yields of mg presented in @xcite and shown in figure  [ fig : mg - previous ] were calculated from models covering a range in mass ( 1@xmath8 to 6@xmath8 ) and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath22 ) . from this figure",
    "we see that the most massive agb models produce the most mg , as a consequence of higher temperatures in the he - shells compared to lower mass stars ; we also notice an increase in production at a given mass with a decrease in metallicity .",
    "the computationally demanding nature of agb models precluded a detailed study in that paper of the effect of the major uncertainties ( mass loss , nuclear reaction rates , convection ) .",
    "a recent comprehensive study by @xcite demonstrated that the predictive power of agb models is still seriously undermined by these uncertainties .",
    "the theory of convection has a significant effect on the structure and nucleosynthesis @xcite , whilst varying the mass - loss rate results in larger changes to the stellar yields than varying the nuclear reaction rates @xcite .",
    "however , the magnitude of the errors associated with the relevant nuclear reaction rates is still one of the key questions concerning predictions of magnesium production in intermediate - mass agb models . whilst the rates of the n(@xmath17)f and o(@xmath17)ne reactions are well determined @xcite , the two key @xmath5-capture reaction rates : ne(@xmath16)mg and ne(@xmath17)mg , suffer from large uncertainties at the stellar energies appropriate for agb stars @xcite .",
    "for example , at typical he - shell burning temperatures , @xmath23k , the nacre compilation @xcite give an upper limit to the ne(@xmath16)mg reaction rate that is about 47 times larger than the recommended rate . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the uncertainties are even larger .",
    "the aims of this paper are two fold .",
    "first , we present new reaction rates for the two key @xmath5-capture reactions , with considerably reduced uncertainties compared to those given by the nacre compilation .",
    "second , we use these new rates within models of different metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath24 ) , for a typical mass ( 5@xmath8 ) that produces the mg isotopes during the thermally - pulsing agb ( tp - agb ) phase . for each model",
    "we calculate the stellar yields and compare to previous nucleosynthesis calculations using older estimates of these reaction rates , including those by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also examine the effect of other model uncertainties , in particular the inclusion of a partial mixing zone and mass loss , on the stellar yields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ section : method ] we discuss the numerical method used for the stellar model calculations , including a discussion of the input physics used . in  [ section : rates ] we present new rates for the ne @xmath3 capture reactions .",
    "the results of the calculations are presented in ",
    "[ section : results ] and discussed in  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "we calculate the structure first and perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations afterward , using a post - processing algorithm .",
    "the stellar structure models were calculated with the monash version of the mount stromlo stellar structure program ; see @xcite and references therein for details .",
    "mass loss on the first giant branch is included using the reimer s mass - loss prescription @xcite with the parameter @xmath25 ; on the agb we use the formulation given by @xcite in all models unless indicated otherwise .",
    "we calculate two models ( 5@xmath8 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) using reimer s mass loss on the agb with the parameter @xmath28 . here",
    "we assume that the @xcite and @xcite mass - loss prescriptions , derived for solar - like metallicities or those appropriate for the magellanic clouds , can be applied to @xmath27 intermediate - mass agb models without modification .",
    "the use of either mass - loss law results in a large number of thermal pulses ( up to @xmath29 ) .",
    "all models were calculated from the zero - age main sequence to near the end of the tp - agb phase .",
    "the occurrence of the third dredge up and hot bottom burning ( hbb ) depend critically upon the convection model used @xcite and the method for determining convective borders .",
    "briefly , we use the standard mixing - length theory ( mlt ) for convective regions , with a mixing - length parameter @xmath30 , and determine the border by applying the schwarzschild criterion . hence we do not include convective overshoot , in the usual sense .",
    "we do however , search for a neutral border to the convective zone , in the manner described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that this method has been shown to increase the efficiency of the third dredge - up compared to models that strictly use the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "we performed detailed nucleosynthesis calculations using a post - processing code which includes 74 species and time - dependent diffusive mixing in all convective zones @xcite .",
    "the details of the nucleosynthesis network are outlined in @xcite , but we remind the reader that we include 59 light nuclei and 14 iron - group species .",
    "we also add the fictional particle @xmath31 , to count the number of neutron captures occurring beyond ni @xcite .",
    "initial abundances are taken from @xcite for the @xmath26 models and we assume scaled - solar for the @xmath27 models .",
    "we assume an initially @xmath5-enhanced mixture typical of thin - disk stars @xcite for the 5@xmath8 , @xmath32 models .",
    "the initial mg isotopic ratios ( e.g. mg / mg ) are 21.9% and 35.2% less than solar in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 models , respectively .",
    "the bulk of the 506 reaction rates are from the reaclib data tables @xcite , based on the 1991 updated version .",
    "some of the proton , @xmath5 and neutron capture reaction rates have been updated according to the latest experimental results , see @xcite for details , and we calculate one set of models using these rates .",
    "we define this set to be our _ standard _ set and the results from these computations are shown in figure  [ fig : mg - previous ] . in all the other sets of computed models",
    "we have updated the proton capture rates for the nena and mgal chains to those recommended by nacre ( see table  [ tab : pcaptures ] in  [ app : rates ] for details of which proton capture rates that have been updated ) . with this new set of updated rates ,",
    "we study the effect of changing the ne @xmath3 rates : we run models with our standard choice for these rates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* without the inclusion of the 633 kev resonance , indicated as k94 in table  [ tab : mgyields ] ) , with the nacre recommended rates ( indicated as nacre in table  [ tab : mgyields ] ) , and with our new recommended rates , as well as using combinations of the new upper and lower limits .",
    "the reaction rates for the ne+@xmath5 fusion processes are determined by the level structure of the compound nucleus @xmath35 mg above the @xmath5 threshold at @xmath36=10.615 mev and near the neutron threshold @xmath37=11.093 mev .",
    "there is only very limited experimental and theoretical information available about possible natural parity resonances in that energy range and both the @xmath38ne(@xmath17)@xmath35 mg as well as the @xmath38ne(@xmath16)@xmath39 mg reaction rates have substantial uncertainties in the temperature range of stellar helium burning .",
    "these uncertainties have been a matter of debate for quite some time .    the uncertainty for the @xmath38ne(@xmath16)@xmath39 mg reaction is mainly determined by the possible contribution of a low energy 1@xmath40 resonance at 0.538 mev which has been observed both in photon induced neutron emission @xcite as well as in neutron capture measurements @xcite .",
    "yet it is not clear how strongly this level is populated in the @xmath5 channel .",
    "direct @xmath38ne(@xmath16)@xmath39 mg measurements @xcite were performed over the entire energy range down to the neutron threshold , but these measurements were handicapped by cosmic ray induced background in the neutron detectors , therefore only an upper limit for the resonance strength was obtained .",
    "also in a @xmath38ne(@xmath41li , d)@xmath35 mg @xmath5 transfer measurement @xcite only an upper limit for the @xmath5 spectroscopic factor @xmath420.2 was determined .",

    "was neglected .",

    "it was shown by @xcite that in particular the possible contribution of the 2@xmath44level at 11.112 mev to the reaction rate does raise its uncertainty by more than an order of magnitude . in view of this debate and in absence of new data",
    "it seems worthwhile to review the present status and suggest more reliable limits for the rate taking into account all of the presently available experimental information .",
    "as it has been outlined by @xcite , several natural parity resonances near the neutron threshold can contribute significantly to the @xmath38ne(@xmath16)@xmath39 mg reaction rate increasing the neutron production at low energies .",
    "the upper limits given by @xcite were scaled to the experimental upper limits of the resonance state at @xmath45=0.538 mev ( @xmath46=11.153 mev , @xmath47=1@xmath40 ) by @xcite . as pointed out above @xmath5 transfer measurements",

    "in comparison , the r75 mass - loss rate is proportional to both the radius and the luminosity and as we can see from table  [ table : agbmodels ] at the lowest metallicity we consider ( @xmath66 ) the large luminosity at this composition results in fewer tps than using vw93 mass loss , the reverse of the behavior observed at @xmath26 .",

    "the envelope abundances of the mg isotopes are first modified by the operation of the sdu , and the magnitude of such modifications increases with a decrease in the metallicity or an increase increase in the mass . for the 5@xmath8 , @xmath26 , the envelope mg abundance decreases by 4.2% while mg increases by 3.7% after the sdu , whereas in the 5@xmath8 , @xmath34 model we observe a decrease of 9.4% in the mg abundance and an 8.4% increase in mg . for all cases but the 5@xmath8 , @xmath27 model , the mg abundance does not change . for this model ,",
    "the mg abundance increases by 11% , whereas the mg and mg abundances decrease by 13% and 6.8% respectively .",
    "the results quoted above are for the calculations that use the nacre nena and mgal chain reaction rates .    in figure  [ m5z02 ]",
    "we show the evolution during the tp - agb phase of the mg ( solid line ) and mg ( dashed line ) abundances at the surface of the 5@xmath8 , @xmath26 model for four different choices of the ne @xmath3 reaction rates .",
    "the abundances in figure  [ m5z02 ] are the mole fraction , @xmath80 ( where the mass fraction @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the atomic mass ) , scaled to the total magnesium abundance , mg @xmath83 mg@xmath60mg@xmath60 mg . in figure  [ mg - surf ]",
    "we show the surface abundance evolution of the mg isotopes for three different initial compositions , that use the new recommended rates for the ne @xmath3 reactions . in table",
    "[ tab : agb2 ] we also present the mg isotope ratios ( in terms of mg : mg : mg ) at the beginning and at the end of the tp - agb phase for each model .",
    "figure  [ mg - surf ] and table  [ tab : agb2 ] shows the influence of metallicity on the evolution of the mg isotopes , where the effects of hbb become more significant at lower @xmath6 .    from figure  [ m5z02 ]",
    "we see the important result that using the new recommended rates for the ne @xmath2 reactions does not result in large changes to the production of mg compared to the calculations performed using older estimates . for the solar metallicity model ,",
    "the final surface mg isotopic ratios are 70.8:13.5:15.6 when using nacre compared to 72.2:12.4:15.4 when using the new recommended rates .",
    "the only observable change is less mg but about the same amount ( or just slightly less ) mg .",
    "these results are consistently observed in the metal - poor agb models , although the trends are stronger at lower metallicity .    to explain the above trends , we need to examine the behavior of the new rates compared to the nacre and k94 rates .",
    "we produce less mg because the older estimates for the ne(@xmath20)mg reaction are up to 40% faster at typical he - shell burning temperatures i.e. @xmath84k to @xmath85k . why the production of mg is reduced or remains about",
    "the same is not immediately obvious given that the new recommended rate is faster than both the nacre ( by up to 26% ) and k94 ( by 70% to 100% ) rates .",
    "the reason is again related to the ( @xmath20 ) reaction which releases neutrons during a tp , some of which are captured to produce mg , a process that is most efficient in the lowest @xmath6 models . in the solar metallicity models the production of mg is less dependent on the neutron flux and we produce about the same when using the new recommended rate for the ne(@xmath17)mg reaction .      in the first row of table  [ tab :",
    "mgyields ] we present the stellar yields of mg and mg ( in @xmath8 ) for the 5@xmath8 models of different @xmath6 , computed using the new recommended rates . in other rows",
    "we present the percentage difference between yields calculated with a different set of rates ( as noted in the table ) and our reference yields given in the first row yield(ref)]/yield(ref ) multiplied by 100 , where @xmath86 is one of the combinations of reaction rates described in  [",
    "section : method ] ] . in figure  [ yield - compare1 ]",
    "we show the percentage difference between the stellar yields calculated using the new recommended rates ( the reference ) , the new upper and lower limits and the nacre recommended rates , for two different metallicities .",
    "the @xmath87-axis is atomic mass , and we present percentage differences for ne through to p , with al included at @xmath88 .",
    "according to the definition of the percentage difference given above , a positive difference means that that model produced ( or destroyed ) more of a given species compared to our reference case . to compare to the magnitude of the uncertainties",
    "associated the nacre rates , in figure  [ yield - compare2 ] we show the percentage difference for models that use the nacre recommended ( the reference ) and the nacre upper and lower limits .",
    "we also vary the mg(@xmath19)mg reaction rate by a factor of two each way ( see figure  [ yield - compare2 ] ) .",
    "these figures show that using the new rates for the ne @xmath2 reactions results in considerably smaller uncertainties in the production of all isotopes between ne to p compared to models that use the nacre rates . for the mg isotopes ,",
    "differences of the order @xmath11400% in the case of the 5@xmath8 , @xmath26 model with the nacre upper limits are reduced to less than 30% , when using the new upper limits . for models of lower metallicity , the uncertainties are even smaller ( at most @xmath89% ) . varying the mg(@xmath19)mg reaction rate given by @xcite by a factor of two each way results in differences of at most 33% in the production of p , about 26% in the production of mg and about 15% in the production of mg for all models , regardless of metallicity .",
    "note that the abundance of heavier isotopes are affected by neutron captures hence the dependence on these reaction rates .",
    "the percentage differences reported in table  [ tab : mgyields ] and shown in figures  [ yield - compare1 ] and  [ yield - compare2 ] illustrate that the computed errors decrease with a decrease in the metallicity of the model .",
    "the reason could be that the yields significantly increase with an decrease in @xmath6 , and hence changes to a larger number result in smaller differences than changes to a smaller number ( in the case of the @xmath26 models ) . also , the low @xmath6 models have more tps and more efficient hbb means that the proton - capture mgal chain reactions have a greater overall effect on the stellar yields",
    ".      the inclusion of a partial mixing zone ( pmz ) at the deepest penetration of the tdu will mix protons from the envelope into the he - intershell , producing a c pocket . in the pmz neutrons",
    "are liberated during the interpulse period by the neutron source reaction c(@xmath16)o and the mg isotopic abundances can be modified because of the activation of the chain of neutron captures starting from the abundant ne and proceeding through na to mg , mg and mg .",
    "given the high value of the neutron capture cross section of mg , with respect to those of mg and mg ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , neutron captures in the c pocket produce mg and mg , while depleting mg .",
    "the details of how the c pocket forms is still unknown although various mechanisms have been proposed ; see @xcite for a wider discussion . in nucleosynthesis studies , the extent of the pocket is usually set as a free parameter with typical values @xmath901/15@xmath69 the mass of the he - intershell @xcite . in intermediate mass stars ,",
    "the mass of the he - intershell is smaller by about an order of magnitude compared to lower mass stars and hence the importance of the c pocket may be lessened @xcite .",
    "as done in previous nucleosynthesis studies @xcite , we artificially include in the post - processing calculation a pmz of constant mass @xmath91 in the 5@xmath8 , @xmath26 model .",
    "we chose a proton profile in which the number of protons decreases exponentially with the mass depth below the base of the convective envelope exactly in the same way as described in @xcite .",
    "the mass of the he - intershell decreases with evolution and for the solar metallicity model , the final he - shell mass is about 0.001 , so that our pmz region is at maximum 1/10@xmath69 of the he intershell .",
    "the inclusion of the pmz produces small percentage differences ( less than @xmath1110% ) for most species , with the exception of p ( 28% ) and the particle @xmath31 ( 104% ) . hence there are no changes to the mg yields with the introduction of a pmz of @xmath91 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the results obtained by @xcite for the elements si and ti and can be extended to all intermediate - mass elements .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , since elements lighter than iron have very small neutron capture cross sections , as much as 3 orders of magnitude smaller as compared to those of nuclei heavier than iron , their abundances are not strongly affected by the neutron flux in the c pocket .",
    "in fact , the changes in the abundances of intermediate mass elements in the c pocket are at maximum of one order of magnitude , while the abundances of heavy elements are produced by up to three orders of magnitudes of their initial values ( see e.g. table 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "second , the c pocket is engulfed and diluted ( of factors between 1/20@xmath69 to 1/10@xmath69 ) by the next growing convective pulse , and is thus mixed with material already @xmath5 processed during the previous pulses , and with the ashes of the h - burning shell . during this dilution process",
    "the signature on intermediate mass elements of neutron captures in the c pocket is completely lost . as for proton captures occurring in the pmz region just after the mixing of protons has occurred , they are expected to destroy mg only in the upper layer of the pmz where the number of protons is higher than 0.5 ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus they do not produce a strong effect when this region is diluted in the he intershell , unless the proton profile is very different from the one assumed here .",
    "we also experiment with varying the mass - loss rate .",
    "the results for the @xmath26 case with r75 mass loss are shown in figure  [ m5z02r75 ] . in this figure",
    "we observe large differences of a few hundred percent for most species .",
    "for the 5@xmath8 , @xmath27 r75 model we use two different choices of the ne @xmath2 reaction rates , as described in figure  [ m5z0001r75 ] .",
    "the r75 model has fewer tps than the vw93 case which results in smaller yields , hence the negative values .",
    "we see from figure  [ m5z0001r75 ] that changing the reaction rates has only a small effect on the yields , compared to the change induced by varying the mass - loss rate .",
    "this was also well demonstrated by @xcite for intermediate mass agb stars of @xmath92 .",
    "the species most affected by the change in mass - loss law are na , mg and al , because the abundances of these isotopes depend on the duration of the hbb phase .      with regards to the reaction rates ,",
    "uncertainties remain related to the proton capture rates for the nena and mgal chains that modify the abundances of these nuclei because of hbb .",
    "table  [ tab : mgyields ] shows that updating these proton capture rates from our standard set to those recommended by nacre did not produce any major modifications on the mg isotopes , since variations are only a few percent .",
    "the variations are small because the reaction rates in the mgal chain which affect the mg isotopic ratios the most are similar between nacre and our standard choices , with differences typically less than 40% .",
    "a detailed study of the impact of the uncertainties of proton capture reactions on the results produced by hot bottom burning on the ne , na , mg and al isotopes is underway ( izzard , lugaro , karakas & iliadis , 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "we discussed in the introduction that major uncertainties are still present in the computation of the stellar models , in particular in relation to the treatment of convection and of convective boundaries . when our results for the 5@xmath8 , @xmath34 model , which are calculated using mlt with @xmath93 , are compared with those produced by a 5@xmath8 , @xmath92 model computed using the `` full spectrum of turbulence '' ( fst ) prescription for convective regions by @xcite , we find that the final abundances of the mg isotopes are lower in the fst case with respect to our case by about 2  dex for mg , 1  dex for mg and 0.4  dex for mg ( including the contribution of radioactive al ) . in particular , in our case , mg and mg are produced in similar abundances by the effect of the ne @xmath2 reactions and deep tdu , while , in the fst case , the production of nuclei of mass a@xmath8326 ( al and mg ) is favored with respect to that of mg by the combined effect of strong hbb and weak tdu ( ventura p. 2005",
    ", private communication ) .",
    "these different behaviors should be tested against data from pre - solar grains and , using gce models , against the observations of the mg isotopes in stars , and also the galactic abundance of the radioactive nucleus al , as obtained by the galactic gamma line at 1.809  mev @xcite .",
    "@xcite implements a diffusive convective overshoot scheme at all convective borders in his agb models ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which results in a considerably different stellar structure to our models of the same mass and metallicity .",
    "the most significant differences are hotter tps and deeper tdu ( where @xmath94 ) , as well as the mixing of some co core material into the flash - driven convective pocket .",
    "if we compare the surface mg mass fractions after the 14@xmath69 tp , we find that these isotopes are enriched by up to 5 times more in herwig s 5@xmath8 , @xmath27 model compared to our equivalent case with the new recommended rates .",
    "these differences are much larger than those introduced by the ne @xmath2 capture rates .",
    "herwig also reports @xmath95 after 14 tps , whereas after the same number of pulses we find this ratio to be less than unity .",
    "this is because hotter tps result in a stronger activation of the ne(@xmath20)mg reaction hence more neutrons are released that are captured by mg to form mg .",
    "the main important result of the present study is that the reduction of the uncertainties on the ne @xmath2 reaction rates has allowed us to considerably reduce the uncertainties coming from these rates on the production of isotopes from mg to p in agb stars of intermediate mass .",
    "the uncertainties on the mg yields are now at a level of @xmath96% , much lower than those obtained when using the nacre upper or lower limits .",
    "the yields of mg and mg are 20% to 45% and 9% to 16% , respectively , smaller with the new rates , as compared to nacre .",
    "the uncertainties have also been reduced for species heavier than mg , where for example , the uncertainty on the production of p in solar metallicity models is now at a level of 35% , much lower than the 400% obtained when using the nacre upper limit .",
    "these results are clearly illustrated by figures  [ yield - compare1 ] and  [ yield - compare2 ] and in table  [ tab : mgyields ] .",
    "from our analysis it would appear that among the uncertainties related to the stellar models , those coming from the treatment of convection and of the mass loss are the largest .",
    "we described earlier that these are enormous when compared to the current uncertainties coming from the ne @xmath2 reaction rates .",
    "much effort is needed to improve the situation for agb models , in particular with respect to convection , by trying to evaluate and reduce the uncertainties , perhaps by exploiting all the available observational constraints .",
    "our new evaluation of the ne @xmath3 reaction rates will encourage much future work , as these rates are important for many nucleosynthetic processes and sites .",
    "the ne(@xmath20)mg reaction is an important source of neutrons both during the final evolutionary stages of massive stars , and during the agb phase of low to intermediate mass stars .",
    "it is responsible for the production of heavy s - process elements in these environments @xcite . the new rate and its uncertainties have to be tested in relation to this process .",
    "moreover , the smaller uncertainties of the rates presented here with respect to those in nacre , appear to rule out the possibility that the production of the relatively abundant p - only isotopes of mo and ru could be related to a high value of the ne(@xmath20)mg rates @xcite .",
    "it is important to study the relative production of mg and mg , as we have done in table  [ tab : mgyields ] , because both spectroscopic observations and the analysis of pre - solar grains are able to separate these two isotopes .",
    "also the contribution of radioactive al to the abundance of mg has to be carefully evaluated .",
    "in particular , one pre - solar spinel grain ( * ? ? ? * oc2 ) appears to bear the signature of nucleosynthesis in intermediate mass agb stars , with excesses in both mg and mg .",
    "a future application of our present work will be to compare our detailed results to the composition of this grain , extending the study to the oxygen isotopic ratios in agb stars and their uncertainties , as these are also measured in the grain .",
