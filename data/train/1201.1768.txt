    "although various properties of light mesons have been explained within this @xmath9 minimum fock space , there are still properties of some meson states can not be described well by this quark model  @xcite .",
    "in fact , mesons might be more complicated objects with higher fock components other than the lowest @xmath9 .",
    "the wavefunction of zero baryon number ( b=0 ) hadron , if the gluon degree of freedom is neglected , should be in general as @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "the recent studies on meson spectroscopy called for unquench the quark model , i.e. , the @xmath9 and @xmath12 mixing  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the introduction of tetraquark states @xmath12 is indispensable for the states with exotic quantum numbers  @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "comprehensive researches on tetraquark states have been carried out by many authors  @xcite , because belle , babar and other experimental collaborations have observed many open and hidden charmed hadrons , which are difficult to be fitted into the conventional meson @xmath13 spectra  @xcite .",
    "the states with quantum numbers @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 had been theoretically studied as tetraquark states  @xcite .",
    "experimental evidences of the exotic states with quantum numbers @xmath17 were accumulated  @xcite .",
    "the investigations of multiquark states with flux - tube structures will provide important low energy quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) information , such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 interactions  @xcite , which is absent in ordinary hadrons due to their unique flux - tube structure .",
    "qcd is widely accepted as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , in which color confinement is a long - distance behavior whose understanding continues to be a challenge for theoretical physics .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) allows us to investigate the confinement phenomenon in a nonperturbative framework and its calculations on mesons , baryons , tetraquark and pentaquark states reveal flux - tube or string like structure  @xcite .",
    "such flux - tube like structures lead to a `` phenomenological '' understanding of color confinement and naturally to a linear confinement potential in @xmath9 and @xmath20 quark systems .",
    "it is well known that nuclear force and molecule force are very similar except for the length and energy scale difference  @xcite . for multi - body systems ,",
    "the flux - tubes in a multi - quark system should be also very similar to the chemical bond in the molecular system . among organic compounds ,",
    "the same molecular constituents may have different chemical bond structure , which are named as isomeric compounds .",
    "in hadronic world , the multiquark states with same quark contents but different flux - tube structures should be similarly called as qcd isomeric compounds .",
    "the past theoretical studies on multiquark states reveal various flux - tube structures  @xcite : hadron molecular states @xmath21_1[q\\bar{q}]_1 $ ] , @xmath21_1[q^3]_1 $ ] , @xmath22_1[q^3]_1 $ ] and @xmath23_1[q^3]_1 $ ] and hidden color states @xmath24_8[q\\bar{q}]_8]_1 $ ] , @xmath25_{\\bar{3}}[\\bar{q}^2]_3]_1 $ ] , @xmath24_8[q^3]_8]_1 $ ] , @xmath25_{\\bar{3}}[q^2]_{\\bar{3}}\\bar{q}]_1 $ ] , @xmath26_3\\bar{q}]_1 $ ] , @xmath27_8[q^3]_8]_1 $ ] , @xmath25_{\\bar{3}}[q^2]_{\\bar{3}}[q^2]_{\\bar{3}}]_1 $ ] , @xmath28_8[q^3]_8]_1 $ ] and a qcd quark benzene @xmath29_1 $ ] , et al , here the subscripts represent color dimensions , which should be mixed and affect the corresponding hadron properties if they really exist .",
    "based on the chemical benzene and the similarity between color flux - tubes and chemical bonds , a new flux - tube structure , the quark benzene , for a six - quark system was proposed and its possible effect on @xmath30 scattering was discussed in our previous paper  @xcite . in the present work , a new flux - tube structure for a tetraquark state , which is similar to the molecular cyclobutadiene and is therefore called as a qcd quark cyclobutadiene , is proposed .",
    "the aims of this paper are : ( i ) to investigate the properties of a qcd cyclobutadiene in the flux - tube model , this model involves a multibody confinement potential and has been successfully applied to multiquark systems  @xcite ; ( ii ) to study the spectra of light tetraquark states with two flux - tube structures ( diquark - antidiquark and qcd quark cyclobutadiene ) , which helps us to understand the meson states beyond a @xmath9 configuration and will provide a new sample to study the mixing of @xmath9 and @xmath31 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : four possible flux - tube structures of a tetraquark system are discussed in sec .",
    "section iii is devoted to the description of the flux - tube model and the multibody confinement potentials of a diquark - antidiquark and a qcd quark cyclobutadiene structures .",
    "a brief introduction of the construction of the wave functions and quantum numbers of a tetraquark state are given in sec .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are presented in section v. a brief summary is given in the last section .",
    "in the flux - tube picture it is assumed that the color - electric flux is confined to narrow , flux - tube like tubes joining quarks .",
    "a flux - tube starts from every quark and ends at an antiquark or a y - shaped junction , where three flux - tubes annihilate or be created  @xcite . in general , a state with @xmath32-particles can be generated by replacing a quark or an antiquark in an @xmath33-particles state by a y - shaped junction and two antiquarks or two quarks . according to this point of view , there are four possible flux - tube structures for a tetraquark system as shown in fig.1 , where @xmath34 represents the position of a quark @xmath35 ( antiquark @xmath36 ) which is denoted by a solid ( hollow ) dot , @xmath37 represents a junction where three flux - tubes meet . a thin line connecting a quark and a junction represents a fundamental flux tube , _ i.e. _ color triplet .",
    "a thick line connecting two junctions is for a color sextet , octet or others , namely a compound flux tube .",
    "the numbers on the flux - tubes represent the color dimensions of the corresponding flux tube .",
    "the different types of flux - tube may have different stiffness  @xcite , the detail will be discussed in the next section .",
    "both the overall color singlet nature of a multi - quark system and the @xmath38 color coupling rule at each junction must be satisfied .",
    "the flux - tube structure ( * a * ) in fig . 1 is a meson - meson molecule state , many newly observed exotic hadrons are discussed in this picture  @xcite",
    ". the tetraquark states with the flux - tubes tructure ( * b * ) generally have high energies due to a repulsive interaction between a quark and an antiquark in a color octet meson .",
    "thus this flux - tube structure is often neglected in the study of multiquark states .",
    "however sometimes the attraction between two color octet mesons will lower the energies of the system considerably .",
    "in the case of the flux - tube structure ( * c * ) , called as a diquark - antidiquark structure , it has two possible color coupling schemes , namely @xmath39_{\\bar{3}}[\\bar{q}\\bar{q}]_{3}]_1 $ ] and @xmath39_6[\\bar{q}\\bar{q}]_{\\bar{6}}]_1 $ ] , the latter is expected to be a highly excited state and therefore the @xmath40 diquark is usually named as a `` bad '' diquark , since the interaction between two symmetric quarks ( antiquarks ) is repulsive , thus many authors are in favor of the @xmath41 (  good \" ) diquark picture  @xcite .    = 3.8 in    the first three flux - tube structures can be explained as the basic structures for a tetraquark system .",
    "the last structure can be generated by means of exciting two y - shape junctions and three compound flux - tubes from vacuum based on the second or third structures . in the constituent quark model ,",
    "a quark is massive .",
    "one can suppose that the recombination of flux - tubes is faster than the motion of the quarks .",
    "subsequently , the ends of four compound flux - tubes meet each other in turn to form a closed flux - tube structure , a ring-@xmath42 , which was interpreted as a pure gluon state by isgur and paton  @xcite , as a glueball state , and discussed in the framework of the dual ginzburg - landau theory  @xcite . with quarks or antiquarks connecting to vertexes of the square by a fundamental flux tube , this picture",
    "could be explained as a @xmath31-glueball hybrid . according to overall color singlet and @xmath38 color coupling rule , the corresponding compound color flux - tube dimensions @xmath43 have six different sets : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the flux - tubes locate in opposite sides of the ring-@xmath42 have the same dimension , which is similar to the symmetry with the distribution of double bonds and single bonds in a cyclobutadiene in chemistry .",
    "we thus name the flux - tube structure ( * d * ) as a qcd quark cyclobutadiene .",
    "of course , the existence of another qcd quark cyclobutadiene is also allowed in which two quarks or antiquarks seat neighboring positions in the flux - tubering .",
    "certainly , more complicated configuration are permitted , including more y - shaped junctions and more complex topological structures .",
    "recently , lqcd and nonperturbative qcd method have made impressive progresses on hadron properties , even on hadron - hadron interactions  @xcite . however , qcd - inspired cqm is still an useful tool in obtaining physical insight for these complicated strong interaction systems .",
    "cqm can offer the most complete description of hadron properties and is probably the most successful phenomenological model of hadron structure  @xcite . in traditional cqm , a two - body interaction proportional to the color charges @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 or 2 and @xmath53 is the distance between two quarks , was introduced to phenomenologically describe quark confinement interaction .",
    "the traditional model can well describe the properties of ordinary hadrons ( @xmath54 and @xmath9 ) because the flux - tube structures for an ordinary hadron are unique and trivial .",
    "however , the traditional model is known to be flawed phenomenologically because it leads to power law van der waals forces between color - singlet hadrons  @xcite .",
    "it is also flawed theoretically in that it is very implausible that the long - range static multi - body potential is just a sum of the two - body ones  @xcite .",
    "many papers were devoted to eliminate the physically nonexisting long - distance van der waals force arising from the traditional models based on the sum of two - body casimir scaled potentials  @xcite .",
    "lqcd studies show that the confinement potential of a multiquark state is a multibody interaction which is proportional to the minimum of the total length of flux - tubes which connects the quarks to form a multiquark state  @xcite .",
    "the naive flux - tube model is developed based on lqcd picture by taking into account a multi - body confinement potential with a harmonic interaction approximation , i.e. , a sum of the square of the length of flux - tubes rather than a linear one is assumed to simplify the calculation  @xcite .",
    "the approximation is justified with the following two reasons : one is that the spatial variations in separation of the quarks ( lengths of the flux tube ) in different hadrons do not differ significantly , so the difference between the two functional forms is small and can be absorbed in the adjustable parameter , the stiffness .",
    "the other is that we are using a nonrelativistic dynamics in the study .",
    "as was shown long ago  @xcite , an interaction energy that varies linearly with separation between fermions in a relativistic first order differential dynamics has a wide region in which a harmonic approximation is valid for the second order ( feynman - gell - mann ) reduction of the equations of motion . combining with gaussian expansion method ( gem ) ,",
    "the flux - tube model including one gluon exchange and one boson exchange interactions was successfully applied to new hadronic states and some interesting results were obtained  @xcite .    within the flux - tube picture ,",
    "the flux - tubes in the ring - structure , see fig.1d , are assumed to have the same properties as the flux - tubes in the ordinary meson or baryon  @xcite .",
    "thus in the flux - tube model with quadratic confinement , the confinement potentials @xmath55 and @xmath56 for diquark - antidiquark and cyclobutadiene structures , have the following forms , respectively .",

    "the limit @xmath61 going to zero indicates the rupture of the corresponding compound flux - tube and then a multiquark state decays into several color singlet hadrons .",

    "such as in the process of a meson - meson scattering , when two color singlet mesons are separated far away , the dominant component of the system should be two isolated color singlet mesons because other hidden color flux - tube structures are suppressed due to the confinement . with the separation reduction",
    ", a deuteron - like meson - meson molecular state may be formed if the attractive force between two color singlet mesons is strong enough .",
    "when they are close enough to be within the range of confinement ( about 1 fm ) , all possible flux - tube structures including the qcd quark cyclobutadiene and even more complicated flux - tube structures may appear due to the excitation and rearrangements of flux - tubes and junctions .",
    "all of these hidden color components can not directly decay into two colorful hadrons due to the color confinement .",
