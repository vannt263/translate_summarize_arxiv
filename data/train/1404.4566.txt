    "one of the most interesting discoveries of the heavy ion program at the lhc is the phenomenon known as _ di  jet asymmetry _  a strong imbalance between the energies of two energetic back  to  back jets produced in an ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "this is attributed to the effect of the interactions of one of the two jets with the dense qcd matter that it traverses , while the other leaves the system unaffected .",
    "originally identified @xcite as missing transverse energy within a conventionally defined ` jet ' with small angular opening ( the same as for the trigger jet ) , this phenomenon has been subsequently shown , via more detailed studies @xcite , to consist in the transport of a part of the jet energy towards large angles and by soft particles .",
    "the total amount of energy thus transferred from small to large angles ( about 10 to 20  gev ) is considerably larger than the typical transverse momentum , @xmath0  gev , of a parton in the medium , so in that sense the effect is large and potentially non  perturbative .    yet , there exists a mechanism within perturbative qcd which naturally leads to energy loss at large angles : the bdmpsz mechanism for medium ",
    "induced gluon radiation @xcite .",
    "most previous studies within this approach have focused on the energy lost by the leading particle , as controlled by relatively hard emissions at small angles .",
    "more recently , in the wake of the lhc data , the attention has been shifted towards softer emissions ( which occur at large angles ) and , more generally , towards a global understanding of the in  medium jet evolution .",
    "this raised the difficulty of including the effects of multiple gluon branchings , which become important for the soft emissions .",
    "after first studies of interference phenomena , which exhibited the role of medium rescattering in destroying the colour coherence between partonic sources @xcite , we have recently demonstrated @xcite that the in  medium jet evolution can be reformulated ( to the perturbative accuracy of interest ) as a classical stochastic process .",
    "this allows for systematic numerical studies via monte carlo methods , like for jets fragmenting in the vacuum .",
    "it also allows for analytic studies , at least for particular problems , like the recent study of the energy flow throughout the cascade in ref .",
    "this study revealed a remarkable phenomenon , which is new in the context of qcd and which , besides its conceptual interest , has also the potential to explain the lhc data for di - jet asymmetry : the _ wave turbulence_. the developments in refs .",
    "@xcite will be briefly reviewed in what follows , with emphasis on the physical picture of wave turbulence .",
    "the bdmpsz mechanism relates the radiative energy loss by an energetic parton propagating through a dense qcd medium ( ` quark ",
    "gluon plasma ' ) to the transverse momentum broadening via scattering off the medium constituents .",
    "a central concept is the _ formation time _",
    "@xmath1  the typical times it takes a gluon with energy @xmath2 to be emitted .",
    "( @xmath3 is the energy of the original parton , a.k.a . the ` leading particle ' . )",
    "the gluon starts as a virtual fluctuation which moves away from its parent parton via quantum diffusion : the transverse separation @xmath4 grows with time as @xmath5 .",
    "the gluon can be considered as ` formed ' when it loses coherence w.r.t to its source , meaning that @xmath4 is at least as large as the gluon transverse wavelength @xmath6 . but",
    "the gluon transverse momentum @xmath7 is itself increasing with time , via collisions which add random kicks @xmath8 at a rate given by the _ jet quenching parameter _",
    "@xmath9 : @xmath10 .",
    "the ` formation ' condition , @xmath11 for @xmath12 , implies @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the typical values of the gluon transverse momentum and its emission angle at the time of formation .",
    "( [ thetaf ] ) applies as long as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the length of the medium and @xmath18 is the mean free path between successive collisions .",
    "the second inequality implies an upper limit on the energy of a gluon that can be emitted via this mechanism , and hence a lower limit on the emission angle : @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the bdmpsz regime corresponds to @xmath21 and hence @xmath22 .",
    "choosing @xmath23 ( the weak coupling estimate @xcite for a qgp with temperature @xmath24  mev ) and @xmath25  fm , one finds @xmath26  gev and @xmath27 .",
    "it is furthermore easy to deduce a parametric estimate for the spectrum of the emitted gluons ( at least for the relatively soft gluons with @xmath28 ) : this is the product of the standard bremsstrahlung spectrum for the emission of a single gluon times the average number of emissions which can occur within the plasma , that is @xmath29  : @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "note that the number of emissions @xmath29 is much smaller than the number of collisions @xmath32 , since several successive collisions can coherently contribute to a single emission ; this is known as the lpm effect ( landau , pomeranchuk , migdal ) and leads to the characteristic @xmath33 dependence of the bdmpsz spectrum . by integrating this spectrum over all the energies @xmath34 , one estimates to the total energy loss by the leading particle : @xmath35 the above integral is dominated by its upper limit : the total energy loss is controlled by the hardest possible emissions , those with energies @xmath36 .",
    "such hard emissions , however , propagate at small angles @xmath37 w.r.t . to the jet axis , so they remain a part of the conventionally defined ` jet ' and thus can not contribute to the di - jet asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the soft gluons with @xmath28 are emitted directly at large angles @xmath38 and , moreover , these angles are further enhanced after emission via rescattering in the medium : a gluon which crosses the medium over a distance @xmath39 acquires a transverse momentum broadening @xmath40 , which for @xmath28 is in fact larger than the respective momentum acquired during formation : @xmath41 . accordingly",
    ", a soft gluon emerges at a typical angle @xmath42 which is even larger than @xmath43  and of course much larger than @xmath44 .",
    "it is interesting to try and estimate the typical energy which would be transported in this way at angles larger than a given value @xmath45 , with @xmath46  : @xmath47 this is only a small fraction @xmath48 of the total energy loss , but it is lost at large angles , so it counts for the energy loss _ by the jet_. yet , eq .",
    "( [ etheta0 ] ) does not show the right trend to explain the lhc data : this estimate decreases quite fast with increasing @xmath45 , thus predicting that most of the energy loss should lie _ just outside _ the jet cone ( and thus be easily recovered when gradually increasing the jet angular opening ) .",
    "this contradicts the results of a detailed analysis by cms @xcite , which show that most of the ` missing ' energy is deposited at very large angles @xmath49 .",
    "however , the previous argument misses an important ingredient : the gluon spectrum is a measure of the probability for emitting a gluon via the bdmpsz mechanism . for @xmath36 , this probability if of @xmath50 , showing that hard emissions are relatively rare events .",
    "but when @xmath51 , this probability becomes of @xmath52 , meaning that the soft emissions with @xmath53 can occur abundantly , event - by - event .",
    "for such small energies , the result must be corrected to account for _ multiple emissions _ and , especially , _",
    "multiple branchings _ of the soft emitted gluons @xcite .",
    "multiple soft emissions by the leading particle have already been discussed by bdmps @xcite : they change the energy distribution of the leading hadron , but not the inclusive spectrum for the soft radiation , nor its ( unrealistic ) prediction for the angular distribution of the radiation , eq .",
    "( [ etheta0 ] ) .",
    "what is more important for the present purposes , is the fate of the soft gluons after being emitted .",
    "the probability for a gluon with energy @xmath54 to split into two daughter gluons with energy fractions @xmath55 and @xmath56 is obtained by replacing @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ spec ] ) .",
    "hence , when @xmath51 , this probability is of @xmath52 for _ generic _ values of @xmath55 : the soft parent gluon is _ certain _ to split and its branching is _ quasi  democratic _",
    "( i.e. unbiased towards the endpoints at @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the distribution in @xmath55 ) @xcite . for even softer energies , @xmath60 , the _ lifetime _",
    "@xmath61 of a gluon generation , i.e. the time interval between two successive branchings , is considerably smaller than the medium size follows from the condition that the emission probability @xmath62 become of @xmath52 . ] : @xmath63 .",
    "hence , such soft gluons undergo successive branchings leading to gluon cascades .",
    "being quasi ",
    "democratic , these branchings efficiently degrade the energy to smaller and smaller values of @xmath55 . and",
    "since the gluons produced by these branchings are softer and softer , they get easily deviated by the collisions in the medium to larger and larger angles ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : jet ] ) .",
    "thus , the quasi  democratic and quasi  deterministic cascade provides a very efficient mechanism for transporting energy at large angles .",
    "this mechanism is a manifestation of a phenomenon well known in other fields of physics : the _ wave turbulence _",
    "@xcite .",
    "( at a small angle @xmath37 ) together with a myriad of soft gluons with @xmath64 , which in turn generate gluon cascades ( at relatively large angles ) via successive , quasi  democratic , branchings . ]",
    "before we characterize this new phenomenon in mode detail , let us describe the formalism which allows us to treat multiple branching @xcite . in principle , one can construct a parton cascade by iterating the @xmath65 ` vertex ' for parton splitting , which here is the bdmpsz spectrum",
    ". this would certainly be the correct procedure for a _ classical _ branching process .",
    "it turns out to that this is also the right procedure for the _ quantum _ problem at hand , but in this case such a procedure is highly non - trivial , as it could be invalidated by _",
    "interference phenomena_. recall e.g. the evolution of a jet via successive parton branching _ in the vacuum _ :",
    "the daughter partons produced by one splitting remain ` color - coherent ' with each other ( their total color charge is fixed to be equal to the respective charge of the parent parton ) until the next splitting of any of them .",
    "this coherence implies interferece effects between the emissions by the two daughter partons , which in that context are well known to be important : they lead to the _ angular ordering _ of successive emissions , which ultimately favors jet collimation @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the situation in that respect appears to be simpler for parton branching _ in the medium _ @xcite : the daughter partons efficiently randomize their color charges via rescattering in the medium and thus lose their mutual color coherence already during the formation process @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the interference effects are suppressed ( as compared to the independent branchings ) by a phase",
    " space factor @xmath66 , which is small whenever @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that the successive medium ",
    "induced emissions can be effectively treated as _",
    "independent _ of each other and taken into account via a _",
    "probabilistic branching process _ , in which the bdmpsz spectrum plays the role of a branching rate . such a process has already been used in applications to phenomenology , albeit on a heuristic basis @xcite .",
    "the general branching process is a markovian process in 3 + 1 dimensions which describes the gluon distribution in energy ( @xmath54 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath7 ) , and its evolution when increasing the medium size @xmath17 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "this process is well suited for numerical studies via monte - carlo simulations .",
    "but analytic results have been obtained too @xcite , for a simplified process in 1 + 1 dimensions which describes the energy distribution alone .",
    "these results lead to an interesting physical picture , that of wave turbulence , that we shall now describe .     due to one additional branching @xmath67 . ]",
    "to that aim , it is convenient to focus on the _ gluon spectrum _",
    "@xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the energy fraction carried by a gluon from the jet and the ` evolution time ' @xmath70 is the medium size in dimensionless units , as defined in the equation below .",
    "the quantity @xmath71 obeys a ` rate ' equation @xcite , which reads , schematically , @xmath72(x,\\tau)\\,\\equiv\\,\\mathrm{gain}[d]-\\mathrm{loss}[d ] \\,,\\qquad{\\rm with}\\quad   \\tau\\,\\equiv\\,\\bar \\alpha\\sqrt{\\frac   { \\hat q}{e}}\\,l\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ` collision term ' @xmath73 $ ] ( a linear functional of @xmath71 ) is the difference between a ` gain ' term and a ` loss ' term , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] .",
    "the ` gain ' term describes the increase in the number of gluons with a given @xmath55 via radiation from gluons with a larger @xmath74 , with any @xmath75 .",
    "the ` loss ' term expresses the decrease in the number of gluons at @xmath55 via their decay @xmath76 , with any @xmath77 . by construction ,",
    "the first iteration of this equation coincides with the bdmpsz spectrum , which in our new notations reads ( for relatively soft gluons with @xmath78 ) @xmath79 this approximation breaks down when @xmath80 , meaning for @xmath81 ( the familiar condition @xmath82 in these new notations ) . in this non  perturbative regime at small @xmath55",
    ", one needs an exact result which resums multiple branchings to all orders .",
    "such a solution has been presented in @xcite and reads ( for @xmath78 once again ) @xmath83 formally , one can read eq .",
    "( [ dex ] ) as ` bdmpsz spectrum by the leading particle @xmath84 survival probability for the latter ' .",
    "however , unlike eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) , the spectrum ( [ dex ] ) also includes the effects of multiple branchings .",
    "that is , the energy in a given bin with @xmath78 is produced both via direct radiation by the leading particle , and via energy transfer from the higher bins at @xmath85 , through successive splittings .",
    "the persistence of the scaling spectrum @xmath86 under this evolution demonstrates that this spectrum is a _",
    "fixed point _ of the collision kernel : @xmath87(x)=0 $ ] for @xmath78 . in turn",
    ", this means that the rate for energy transfer from one parton generation to the next one is independent of the generation ( i.e. of @xmath55 ) .",
    "this property is the distinguished signature of _ wave turbulence _",
    "@xcite : via successive splittings , the energy _",
    "flows _ from large @xmath55 to small @xmath55 without accumulating at any intermediate value of @xmath55 .",
    "it rather accumulates into a condensate at @xmath58 .",
    "since there is only a finite amount of energy available ( the energy @xmath3 of the leading particle ) , it follows that the total energy which is contained in the spectrum ( i.e. in the bins at @xmath88 ) must decrease with time .",
    "indeed , a direct calculation yields @xcite @xmath89 the quantity @xmath90 is the energy fraction carried away by the flow and which formally ends up in the condensate .",
    "as we shall shortly discuss , this energy is in fact transferred to the medium , at very large angles .",
    "these considerations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] which shows the spectrum for various values of @xmath70 . at small @xmath91 ,",
    "the small@xmath55 part of the spectrum rises linearly with @xmath70 , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) ( see the full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) . at the same time , the leading  particle peak , which originally was a @xmath92function at @xmath59 , moves at @xmath93 and becomes broader . for larger times @xmath94 , the source disappears and the spectrum is globally suppressed by the gaussian factor in ( [ dex ] ) ; yet , the scaling behavior @xmath95 is still visible at small @xmath55 ( see the dotted lines in fig .

    "; from ref .",
    "the emergence of a flow component @xmath90 in the energy transport down the cascade explains one of the main characteristics of ( wave ) turbulence : this is a very efficient mechanism for transferring energy between two widely separated scales  here , from @xmath59 down to @xmath58 . to see this ,",
    "let us compute the energy transferred after time @xmath70 below a given value @xmath98 .",
    "this includes two components : the energy which is contained in the spectrum , in the bins at @xmath99 , and the flow energy , which is independent of @xmath100 ( since accumulated at @xmath58 ) . thus , @xmath101 where the second , approximate , equality holds for @xmath102 . note that , even for small times , the flow component dominates over the non  flow one provided @xmath103 , that is , in the non  perturbative regime at small @xmath55 where the multiple branching becomes important . for larger times @xmath94 , the flow piece dominates for any @xmath100 and approaches unity , meaning that the whole energy can be lost towards arbitrarily soft quanta , which propagate at arbitrarily large angles .    to understand how remarkable this situation is ,",
    "let us compare it with the more familiar example of the dglap evolution ( say , for a jet in the vacuum ) , where there is _ no flow_. ( the dglap equation too can be viewed as a ` rate equation ' , cf .",
    "( [ rate ] ) , with the logarithm of the virtuality playing the role of the ` evolution time ' . ) in that case , the splittings are typically asymmetric ( @xmath104 or @xmath105 ) , leading to a rapid increase in the number of gluons at small @xmath55 .",
    "yet most of the energy remains in the few partons with relatively large values of @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , for the dglap cascade , the energy is fully contained within the spectrum ( no flow ) and the energy sum - rule @xmath106 is dominated by the higher values of @xmath55 in the support of the function @xmath71 at time @xmath70 .",
    "conversely , one can show that a necessary condition for the emergence of ( turbulent ) flow is quasi ",
    "democratic branching @xcite .",
    "so far , we have assumed that the evolution remains unchanged down to @xmath58 , but physically this is not the case : when the gluon energies become as low as the typical energy scale in the medium  the ` temperature ' @xmath107  gev  , the gluons ` thermalize ' and disappear from the jet .",
    "the energy which is thus transferred to the medium ( and hence lost by the jet ) can be evaluated by replacing @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ esmall ] ) .",
    "this energy loss is independent of the details of the thermalization mechanism and even of the medium temperature ( since dominated by the flow component , as we shall shortly see ) .",
    "this _ universality _ is the hallmark of turbulence : the rate for energy transfer at the lower end of the cascade is fixed by the turbulent flow alone , and thus is independent of the specific mechanism for dissipation .    to make contact with the phenomenology",
    ", we notice that for a jet with @xmath109 , eq .  ( [ rate ] ) implies @xmath110 , which is quite small . the flow piece in eq .",
    "( [ esmall ] ) , which is independent of @xmath100 , dominates over the non  flow piece for any @xmath111 , a value much larger than the thermalization scale @xmath112 .",
    "thus , in evaluating the energy loss via thermalization , one can keep only the flow component in the small@xmath70 version of eq .",
    "( [ esmall ] ) , as anticipated . returning to physical units ,",
    "one finds @xmath113 where @xmath114 would be equal to @xmath115 according to eq .",
    "( [ esmall ] ) , but a more precise calculation yields @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "this is formally suppressed by an additional power of @xmath117 as compared to the total energy loss by the leading particle , eq .",
    "( [ etot ] ) , which we recall is controlled by hard gluon emissions ( @xmath36 ) at small angles ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "however , the flow contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eth ] ) is numerically quite large ( because @xmath114 is a reasonably large number ) and moreover this is associated with soft emissions at large angles .",

    "( [ eth ] ) predicts @xmath120  gev , a value that compares well with the experimental observations .",
