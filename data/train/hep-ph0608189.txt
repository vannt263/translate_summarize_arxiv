    "to create extremely hot and dense matter with partons as its fundamental components - called the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) - is a major goal of current and future high energy heavy - ion collisions experiments at sps , rhic and lhc @xcite .",
    "however , due to the complex nature of the relativistic nucleus - nucleus reactions , the qgp , if it has been created , escapes direct detection .",
    "therefore , in order to establish the existence and later on to investigate the properties of the new state of matter , one must find observables which allow to deduce the properties of the intermediate ( qgp ) state from the final state hadrons .",
    "the exploration of the transverse collective flow is the earliest predicted observable to probe heated and compressed nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the transverse flow is intimately connected to the pressure gradients .",
    "therefore , it is sensitive to the equation of state ( eos ) and might be used to search for abnormal matter states and phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the intermediate energy regime available at cern - sps or at the future gsi - fair facility is often referred to as the right place to look for a phase transition to the qgp .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations @xcite show that the critical temperature is around 170 mev ( for @xmath7 ) and the critical energy density is around 1 @xmath8 .",
    "these values can already be reached at 20 - 30 agev beam energy . at finite baryo - chemical potential ,",
    "the heated and compressed nuclear matter created at these energies crosses the phase transition line possibly even on the high @xmath9 side of the critical endpoint .",
    "therefore , it is possible to talk about a phase transition of first order , here . during such a first order phase transition the softest point in the equation of state would be mostly pronounced .",
    "for example , the proton antiflow around midrapidity ( `` third flow component''@xcite ) and the collapse of the elliptic flow observable have been declared as a signal for the phase transition @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "recent results on proton and pion directed and elliptic flow from the na49 experiment @xcite are investigated and predictions for fair are presented .",
    "the data is compared to transport model calculations ( urqmd v2.2 ) .",
    "the proton flow measures the behaviour of the nuclear matter during a heavy ion collision , while the flow of pions is a sign for the properties of newly produced particles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii includes an introduction of the urqmd model .",
    "section iii and iv introduce the flow systematics and the different measurement methods .",
    "then , in section v , the directed flow results are shown .",
    "there are rapidity and transverse momentum distributions for 40 and 160 agev beam energy .",

    "v ( c ) the energy dependence of the slope around midrapidity of the directed flow is investigated in the context of the available data .",
    "afterwards , in section vi , the same analysis for the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of elliptic flow ( @xmath1 ) is shown .",
    "section vi ( c ) discusses the excitation function of elliptic flow over the whole energy range from sis to rhic .",
    "section vii summarizes the paper .",
    "for our investigation , the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd v2.2 )  @xcite is applied to heavy ion reactions from @xmath13  mev to @xmath14 gev .",
    "this microscopic transport approach is based on the covariant propagation of constituent quarks and diquarks accompanied by mesonic and baryonic degrees of freedom .",
    "it simulates multiple interactions of in - going and newly produced particles , the excitation and fragmentation of colour strings and the formation and decay of hadronic resonances . towards higher energies ,",
    "the treatment of sub - hadronic degrees of freedom is of major importance . in the present model ,",
    "these degrees of freedom enter via the introduction of a formation time for hadrons produced in the fragmentation of strings @xcite . a phase transition to a quark - gluon state",
    "is not incorporated explicitly into the model dynamics . however , a detailed analysis of the model in equilibrium , yields an effective equation of state of hagedorn type @xcite .",
    "the urqmd transport model is successful in describing the yields and the @xmath15 spectra of different particles in pp and pa collisions @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to study the flow at lower energies and at rhic energies(@xcite ) .",
    "the first coefficient of the fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution of the emitted particles ( @xmath2 ) describes the directed in - plane flow .",
    "the directed flow measures the total amount of transverse flow .",
    "it is most pronounced in semi - central interactions around target and projectile rapidities where the spectators are deflected away from the beam axis due to a bounce - off from the compressed and heated matter in the overlap region .",
    "@xmath2 is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the azimuthal angle of one outgoing particles and @xmath18 is the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane .",
    "the angular brackets denote an average over all considered particles from all events .",
    "three different interesting properties of the directed flow have been proposed .    *",
    "the time scales probed by the directed flow are set by the crossing time of the lorentz - contracted nuclei .",
    "thus , it serves as keyhole to the initial , probably non - equilibrium , stage of the reaction @xcite . *",
    "the softening of the equation of state in a first order phase transition leads to a decreasing directed flow @xcite . *",
    "the space - momentum correlation of the emitted particles can be adressed experimentally via the @xmath2 rapidity distributions of nucleons and pions",
    ".    the second coefficient of the fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution of the emitted particles ( @xmath1 ) is called elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "this type of flow is strongest around central rapidities in semi - peripheral collisions .",
    "it is driven by the anisotropy of the pressure * gradients * , due to the geometric anisotropy of the initial overlapping region . therefore , it is a valuable tool to gain insight into the expanding stage of the fire ball .",
    "@xmath1 is defined by    @xmath19\\rangle \\quad.\\ ] ]    there are two competing effects which lead to contributions with different signs to the integrated @xmath1 value . at low energies or early times",
    "there is the so called `` squeeze - out''-effect .",
    "the spectator matter blocks the emission in the impact parameter direction and therefore the flowing matter is `` squeezed''-out perpendicularly to the reaction plane .",
    "this leads to negative elliptic flow values .",
    "the second effect is the so called in - plane flow .",
    "this type of flow becomes important at higher energies and/or later times . at higher bombarding energies ( @xmath20  gev )",
    "the spectators leave the interaction zone quickly .",
    "the remaining hot and dense matter expands almost freely , where the surface is such that in - plane emission is preferred .",

    "bottom : elliptic flow of pions ( squares ) versus time at midrapidity for mid - central collisions ( b=7 fm).,width=377 ]    let us now explore the time evolution of the pressure gradients in connection with the elliptic flow development .",
    "the transverse pressure gradients have been calculated for the first 10 fm at @xmath24gev ( see fig . [ figv2grad40 ] ) and the highest sps energy ( see fig .",
    "[ figv2grad160 ] ) . in both cases",
    "one observes large pressure gradients in the very early stage of the collision .",
    "for the lower energy the maximum is reached around @xmath25fm and for the higher energy it is shifted to even earlier times .",
    "the difference between the pressure gradients in x- and y- direction is responsible for the @xmath1 development . as it can be seen in figs .",
    "[ figv2grad40](bottom ) and [ figv2grad160](bottom ) the temporal evolution of elliptic flow for pions starts exactly after this maximum .",
    "the elliptic flow increases during @xmath26fm until it reaches almost its final value .",
    "after @xmath27fm it decreases a little because of resonance decays .",
    "so , elliptic flow builds up in the early stage of the collision due to the difference of pressure gradients as it is expected .",

    "in the urqmd model calculation of flow , the exact azimuthal angle of the reaction plane @xmath18 is known by definition . however , an unambiguous experimental measurement of the azimuthal anisotropic flow is not a trivial task due to the unknown orientation of the reaction plane .",
    "often , experiments use the so called reaction plane method @xcite to extract the magnitude of flow . in this method",
    ", the reaction plane is fixed according to the flow vector of the event , then the estimated @xmath1 with respect to the chosen reaction plane is corrected for the event plane resolution , which accounts for the error in the deduction of the reaction plane .",
    "however , these two - particle correlations based method might suffer from effects which are not related to the reaction plane , these additional contributions are usually called non - flow effects @xcite , such as the overall transverse momentum conservation , small angle azimuthal correlations due to final state interactions , resonance decays , jet production @xcite and quantum correlations due to the hbt effect @xcite . recently , the cumulant method was proposed @xcite to diminish the non - flow effects .",
    "the idea of the cumulant method is to extract flow with many - particle cumulants , which are the many - particle correlations with subtraction of the contributions from the correlations due to the lower - order multiplets .",
    "it is believed that the pure many - particle non - flow correlations have much less contributions to the measured flow in the many - particle cumulant method . in other words ,",
    "the many - particle cumulant method should be much less sensitive to non - flow effects @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by the test of the cumulant method with the urqmd model @xcite .",
    "however , the test also shows that , at least for the @xmath1 measurement , the cumulant method is not completely free from the effect of event - by - event @xmath1 fluctuations @xcite .",
    "especially when the genuine @xmath1 signal is weak ( for example , for the most central events and very peripheral events ) , the effect of @xmath1 fluctuations could be so strong that the results from the cumulant method becomes unreliable .",

    "<S> recent data from the na49 experiment on directed and elliptic flow for pb+pb reactions at cern - sps are compared to calculations with a hadron - string transport model , the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model . </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the directed and elliptic flow , i.e. @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the flow results are compared to data at three different centrality bins . generally , a reasonable agreement between the data and the calculations is found . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the energy excitation functions of @xmath2 and @xmath1 from @xmath3  mev to @xmath4  gev are explored within the urqmd framework and discussed in the context of the available data . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that , in the energy regime below @xmath5  gev , the inclusion of nuclear potentials is necessary to describe the data . above @xmath6  gev beam energy , </S>",
    "<S> the urqmd model starts to underestimate the elliptic flow . around the same energy </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the rapidity spectra of the proton directed flow develops negative values . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is known as the third flow component ( `` antiflow '' ) and can not be reproduced by the transport model . </S>",
    "<S> these differences can possibly be explained by assuming a phase transition from hadron gas to quark gluon plasma at about @xmath6  gev . </S>"
