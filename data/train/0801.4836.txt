    "low - temperature magnetoresistance oscillations related to linear and nonlinear transport of electrons in high landau levels of high - mobility two - dimensional systems , induced by microwave radiation@xcite or by direct current excitation,@xcite have attracted a great deal of attention in the past few years . despite the fact that detailed microscopic mechanisms are still under debate",
    ", there is almost no objection to refer these oscillatory magnetoresistances mainly to impurity or disorder scatterings and the direct phonon contributions to resistivity are believed to be negligible in these systems at such low temperatures .",
    "recently , the magnetophonon resonance in semiconductors , previously known to result from electron coupling with optic phonons and can be observed only at high temperatures and high magnetic fields,@xcite has been demonstrated to occur at temperatures as low as @xmath0k and lower magnetic fields in gaas - based heterosystems.@xcite the resonant magnetoresistance was detected and referred to as electron scatterings by two leaky interface phonon modes that have sound velocities @xmath1km / s and @xmath2km / s,@xcite or by a single leaky interface phonon mode that has a velocity @xmath3km / s.@xcite very recently , zhang _ et al_@xcite found that acoustic phonon - induced resistance resonances are dramatically enhanced in the nonlinear dc response and a finite current can strongly modify the phonon resonance behavior , transforming resistance maxima into minima and back.@xcite these phonon - related resistance oscillations remain poorly understood , especially the exact resonant condition , relative contributions of different modes and how they are affected by temperature and current .    in this paper",
    ", we present a systematic analysis on nonlinear magnetotransport in gaas - based semiconductors with a microscopic balance - equation scheme directly controlled by the current , which takes into account electron couplings with impurity , bulk longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons as well as polar optic phonons . due to the quick rise of electron temperature ,",
    "the phonon resonances are dramatically enhanced by a finite current .",
    "when electron drift velocity @xmath4 gets into the supersonic regime ( @xmath5 , the speed of sound ) , additional magnetophonon resonance peaks emerge . as a result , a remarkable resistance oscillation and",
    "a negative differential resistivity appear in the nonlinear magnetotransport in a modest mobility sample at low temperatures .",
    "we consider a quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) system consisting of @xmath6 electrons in a unit area of an @xmath7-@xmath8 plane .",
    "these electrons , subjected to a uniform magnetic field @xmath9 along the @xmath10 direction and a uniform electric field @xmath11 in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane , are scattered by random impurities and by phonons in the lattice . in terms of the center - of - mass momentum and coordinate defined as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the momentum and coordinate of the @xmath16th electron in the 2d plane , and the relative electron momentum and coordinate @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the hamiltonian @xmath19 of this coupled electron - phonon system can be written as the sum of a center - of - mass part @xmath20 , a relative electron part @xmath21,@xcite @xmath22\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{1.1cm}+\\sum_{i < j}v_{\\rm c}({\\bm r}_{i}'-{\\bm r}_{j}',z_i , z_j),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\label{her}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and a phonon part @xmath23 , together with electron - impurity and electron - phonon interactions as follows : @xmath24 here , @xmath25 , the in - plane component of the vector potential of the uniform magnetic field , is linear in the spatial coordinate @xmath26 ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the electron effective mass parallel and perpendicular to the plane ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for the confined and coulomb potentials , respectively @xmath31 is the density operator of the two - dimensionalo ( 2d ) relative electrons ; @xmath32 is the effective potential of the @xmath33th impurity located at @xmath34 in the 2d fourier space ; @xmath35 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the bulk phonon with wave vector @xmath36 in branch @xmath37 that has an energy @xmath38 ; @xmath39 is the matrix element of the electron - phonon interaction in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) plane - wave representation ; and @xmath40 is a form factor of the quasi-2d electron.@xcite here , for simplicity , we have assumed that the quasi-2d electrons occupy only the lowest subband and thus the subband summation indices in eqs.([hei ] ) and ( [ hep ] ) are neglected.@xcite    the separation of the electron hamiltonian into a center - of - mass part and a relative electron part amounts to looking at electrons in a reference frame moving with their center of mass .",
    "the most important feature of this separation is that a spatially uniform electric field shows up only in @xmath20 , and that @xmath21 is the hamiltonian of a many particle system subject to a perpendicular magnetic field _ without the electric field_. this enables us to deal with relative electrons in the magnetic field _ without tilting the landau levels_. the coupling between the center of mass and relative electrons is shown by the factor @xmath41 inside the momentum summation in @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the moving center - of - mass assisted transitions of relative electrons between different landau levels provide the major mechanism for the current - driven magnetotransport .",

    "we treat it as a semiempirical parameter , which will serve as the only adjustable parameter in the present investigation .    at lattice temperature @xmath47 ,",
    "the energy balance [ eq.([eqenergy ] ) ] yields the electron temperature @xmath46 for a given carrier drift velocity @xmath48 at a given magnetic field .",
    "then , with this @xmath46 , the force balance [ eq.([eqforce ] ) ] determines the relation between @xmath48 , @xmath74 and @xmath11 , i.e. , the longitudinal and transverse resistivities in the magnetotransport .",
    "such a formulation indicates that the carrier drift velocity @xmath48 is the basic physical quantity that controls the nonlinear magnetotransport .",
    "the frictional force @xmath75 and energy dissipation rate @xmath53 solely depend on the drift velocity @xmath48 at a given magnetic field @xmath73 , while the electric field only plays a role in balancing the frictional force .",
    "thus , the resistivity is directly determined by the scattering mechanisms and by the drift velocity or the current density , rather than by the electric field .",
    "equations ( [ eqforce ] ) and ( [ eqenergy ] ) are conveniently applied to current - driven magnetotransport of any configuration , in which the current is an experimentally directly controlled quantity . for",
    "an isotropic system where the frictional force is in the opposite direction of the drift velocity @xmath48 and the magnitudes of both the frictional force and the energy - loss rate depend only on @xmath76 , we can write @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in the hall configuration with velocity @xmath48 in the @xmath7 direction [ @xmath79 or the current density @xmath80 and @xmath81 , eq.([eqforce ] )",

    "nevertheless , it is still useful to formally write the total resistivity as a direct sum of separate scattering contributions by the respective components of the frictional force @xmath75 .",
    "in the numerical analysis we first concentrate on a gaas - based heterosystem with carrier sheet density @xmath88m@xmath89 and zero - temperature linear mobility @xmath90m@xmath91/vs in the absence of a magnetic field , considering electron scatterings from bulk longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonons ( one branch , via the deformation potential and piezoelectric couplings with electrons ) and transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonons ( two branches , via the piezoelectric coupling with electrons ) , as well as from remote and background impurities .",

    "first , it results in the electron heating and thus raises the rate of phonon emission . as a result , the phonon contributed resistivity and the oscillatory amplitude of magneto - phonon resonance is enhanced with increasing bias current density .",
    "the electron temperature is determined by the frictional force @xmath82 and the energy - dissipation rate @xmath143 through the energy balance [ ea.([eqenergy ] ) ] .",
    "generally , longitudinal acoustic phonons give the dominant contribution to @xmath143 in gaas - based systems at lattice temperatures considered in this paper ( @xmath144k ) , and the polar optic ( lo ) phonons are usually frozen .",
    "however , electron scattering from lo phonons should still be taken into account when the bias current density becomes strong that electron temperature @xmath46 rises up to the order of @xmath145k , at which a weak emission of lo phonons can take place .",

    "the differential resistivity @xmath86 of the system at a given bias drift velocity @xmath4 is obtained from the @xmath154 function through eq.([eqdr ] ) , with the electron temperature @xmath46 determined above . since the peak ( valley )",
    "positions of @xmath46 are essentially fixed in the @xmath73 axis , the variation of the resistivity maxima ( minima ) with changing bias velocity @xmath4 is mainly determined by its direct effect in the @xmath154 function , as reflected in the frequency shift @xmath155 in the argument of the electron density correlation function .",
    "physically , because an extra energy @xmath156 is provided by the moving center of mass to the relative electrons during the scattering process , the transition rate of an electron from landau level @xmath67 to @xmath157 ( @xmath157 can be equal to or not equal to @xmath67 ) experiences a change due to impurity and phonon scatterings , which shows up through the @xmath158 shift in , for instance , the @xmath159 function in @xmath160 ( i.e. , the resistivity ) .",
    "the effect of such an energy shift in the impurity scattering case has been shown to induce an oscillatory differential magnetoresistance @xmath109 that is controlled by the following parameter:@xcite @xmath161 which has peak positions at around @xmath162 . in the case of acoustic phonon scatterings",
    ", the resistivity maxima are expected to occur near the possible integer values of parameter @xmath163 , i.e. , @xmath164 and this integer can be used as an identification for each magnetophonon resonance peak of the differential resistivity in nonlinear transport .",
    "when drift velocity @xmath4 is smaller than the sound speed @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) , the resonance condition ( [ sj ] ) can be satisfied only for positive integers @xmath167 , whence the effect of a small current @xmath142 is roughly to change the resistivity maxima from @xmath168 in the linear case to @xmath169 this means that for a given index number @xmath122 , the peak position of magnetophonon resonance moves towards lower @xmath73 with increasing current density , and for a given @xmath142 the shifts of peak positions in the @xmath170 axis are larger for larger index @xmath122 ( lower @xmath73 field ) .",
    "these features are clearly seen in fig.2(a ) , where we show the calculated differential resistivity @xmath86 as a function of the magnetic field at @xmath112k under different bias drift velocities from @xmath171 to 0.006 in steps of 0.0005 , corresponding to current densities",
    "@xmath172a / m in steps of 0.058a / m . we see that though within certain @xmath4 and @xmath73-field ranges , e.g. @xmath173 and @xmath73 is around @xmath174 t , the peak positions of the resistivity may be somewhat influenced by the rapid change in the electron temperature because of the enhanced phonon contributions at higher @xmath46 ; the main trend of the resistivity peak shift with increasing @xmath142 remains .",
    "the progress and movement of respective peaks compare favorably with recent experimental observation.@xcite    , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath86 ) and electron temperature @xmath46 are shown as functions of @xmath175 at fixed magnetic fields @xmath176 , and 0.72 t , respectively , at @xmath107k .",

    "the prominent oscillations show up in resistivities @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath86 , all exhibiting a main oscillation period @xmath181 . however , since the peak positions of la and ta phonon resistivities @xmath110 and @xmath111 in the @xmath175 axis change with changing magnetic field , as indicated by condition ( [ sj ] ) ( @xmath182 ) , the oscillating behavior of total resistivity @xmath86 is strongly @xmath73-field dependent .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath183 t , the la phonon resonance peaks 1,0,-1 , and -2 are essentially in phase with the ta phonon resonance peaks 0,-1,-2 and -3 , and close to the maxima of the impurity resistivity @xmath109 near @xmath184 , which lead to an enhanced @xmath86 with maxima around these positions [ fig.3(c ) ] . in the case of @xmath185 t , where the la resonance peaks 1,0,-1 , and -2 are around @xmath186 , and 3.5 and the ta resonance peaks 0,-1,-2 , and -3 are around @xmath187 , and 3.7 , the resulting @xmath86 oscillation is out - of - phase with that of @xmath109 oscillation and has secondary extremes [ fig.3(b ) ] . as a result , at fixed @xmath175 , e.g. , @xmath188 , @xmath86 exhibits maxima for @xmath183 and 0.72 t while minima for @xmath189 and 0.47 t .",

    "in summary , we have examined magneto - phonon resonances in gaas - based 2d systems at low temperatures .",
    "good agreement between theoretical prediction and experimental observation is obtained by using the well - defined bulk la and ta phonon modes with no adjustable parameter .",
