    "phenomena involving high transverse momenta @xmath0 in @xmath1@xmath1 collisions with the incoming photons being real or quasi ",
    "real have been studied for many years now , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "emphasis has been on @xmath1@xmath1 collisions at relatively high center of mass energies in order to obtain information beyond the low @xmath2 region which is determined by soft physics .",
    "this has been achieved recently at the tristan @xcite and lep @xcite storage rings .",
    "two tristan collaborations , topaz @xcite and amy @xcite have presented data for inclusive one  jet and two  jet cross sections with @xmath2 s up to 8 gev .",
    "this is the domain of perturbative qcd calculations which are expected to be valid when there is a large energy scale in the interaction .",
    "then the lowest order diagram is that of the quark parton model ( qpm ) ( see fig .",
    "1a ) also referred to as the direct contribution in leading order ( lo ) qcd . here the two photons couple directly to the charge of the bare quark with no further interactions involved , so that the final state consists of just two jets . in next  to  leading order ( nlo ) , i.e. @xmath3 , there exists a contribution as , for example , the one in fig .",
    "1b where a gluon is emitted from the internal quark line .",
    "this contribution becomes singular when the momentum of the outgoing quark ( antiquark ) is collinear to the momentum of the upper ( lower ) photon .",
    "this divergent contribution is dealt with by introducing the scale dependent photon structure function at the upper or lower vertex .",
    "this leads to the so ",
    "called ` single resolved ' ( sr ) contribution depicted in fig .",
    "1c in lo , being @xmath4 , when the photon structure function is factored out .",
    "nlo corrections to the single resolved cross section , for example , produce contributions with a gluon emitted from the internal quark line in fig .",
    "1d which becomes singular in the collinear limit .",
    "these singular pieces are absorbed as before in the scale dependent photon structure function now at the lower ( upper ) vertex .",
    "this is the double resolved contribution ( dr ) with photon structure functions at the upper and lower vertex , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "in addition to the two high @xmath2 jets the single resolved ( double resolved ) contributions have one ( two ) low @xmath2 `` beam jets '' or photon remnant jets .",
    "this was first discussed in the paper by brodsky et al .",
    "@xcite who showed that resolved photon cross sections are of the same order as from lo direct contributions , i.e. the qpm process .",
    "this work has recently be extended by drees and godbole @xcite .    in all these processes ,",
    "direct ( d ) , single resolved ( sr ) and double resolved ( dr ) there is a hard subprocess in which two partons scatter at high @xmath2 which can be calculated in perturbative qcd .",
    "the subprocess cross sections are convoluted with luminosity functions that give the distributions of the virtual photons in an electron and one or two photon structure functions that give the distribution of quarks and gluons inside a photon .",
    "the topological structure of these cross sections is equivalent to cross sections for jet production in @xmath5 collisions .",
    "there the direct ( resolved ) process corresponds to the sr ( dr ) component in @xmath6 collisions .",
    "the proton structure function must be replaced by the photon structure function .    in lo calculations",
    "the three cross sections , d , sr and dr are superimposed , and rates for topologies with two high @xmath2 jets plus one or two photon remnant jets can be predicted .",
    "it is well known that lo calculations give only qualitative results . in this order",
    "the predictions depend highly on the factorization scale , in particular for the dr contribution .",
    "furthermore lo results do not depend on any jet definition which is present in nlo and in the experimental data .",
    "therefore all three processes must be treated in nlo , i.e.  with higher order corrections included both in the photon structure function and the hard subprocesses in a consistent way .",
    "such calculations were done by aurenche et al .  for the inclusive single ",
    "jet cross section at @xmath7 gev @xcite .",
    "they compared their results with the topaz data @xcite and found good argeement up to the highest @xmath2 by slightly adjusting the non  perturbative input of the photon structure function still consistent with the data on @xmath8 .",
    "besides the inclusive one  jet data from topaz @xcite and amy @xcite there exist also measurements of the inclusive two  jet cross sections by the topaz @xcite and the amy @xcite collaborations .",
    "these data have been compared so far only to lo calculations by the authors assuming different sets of photon structure functions . in this work",
    "we make an effort to predict these two  jet cross sections in nlo assuming the same kinematical constraints as in the two tristan experiments .",
    "unfortunately we are not in the position yet to calculate all three components , the d , sr and dr cross sections up to nlo .",
    "we have only the nlo formalism for the direct and the single resolved cross section at our disposal .",
    "since they yield , depending on @xmath2 , the major part of the two  jet cross section at 58 gev we shall estimate the dr cross section with a lowest order calculation including some @xmath9 factor .",
    "this @xmath9 factor is estimated with the inclusive one  jet cross section by comparing with the nlo prediction .    in section 2",
    "we explain the formalism used to calculate the inclusive two  jet cross section .",
    "section 3 contains the comparison with the topaz and amy data and a discussion of the results .",
    "as explained in the introduction the inclusive jet cross section at large @xmath2 consists of three parts according to how the incoming photons take part in the hard subprocesses . if both photons couple to the quarks in the hard scattering one defines the direct cross section @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "for example , the inclusive two  jet cross section has the following form : @xmath11 in ( [ f1 ] ) @xmath2 denotes the transverse momentum of the measured or trigger jet with rapidity @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the rapidity of another jet such that in the three  jet sample these two jets have the highest and second highest @xmath2 .",
    "the first term on the right  hand side of ( [ f1 ] ) stands for the lo cross section and the second term is the nlo correction which depends on the factorization scale @xmath14 , at which the initial state collinear singularity is absorbed in the photon structure function .",
    "the variable @xmath15 is the usual parameter defining the size of the jets with transverse momentum @xmath2 , rapidity @xmath16 and azimuthal angle @xmath17 .",
    "when two partons fulfill the snowmass constraint @xcite with the cone size parameter @xmath15 they are recombined in one jet .",
    "the same jet definition is used in the topaz and amy analysis .",
    "the nlo corrections @xmath18 are calculated with the phase ",
    "space slicing method using for the seperation of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 cross sections an invariant mass cut  off @xmath21 , defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the partonic center of mass energy squared . in the direct process",
    "the cross section for @xmath24 has soft , initial and final state collinear singularities .",
    "the @xmath24 cross section is integrated over these singular regions up to the cut  off value @xmath21 which isolates the respective singularities which are cancelled against the singular contributions of the virtual corrections to @xmath25 and the subtraction term at the scale @xmath14 which are absorbed into the photon structure function .",
    "outside the cut  off region controlled by the parameter @xmath21 we have genuine @xmath26 final states . in this contribution two of the partons",
    "are recombined if they obey the snowmass constraint . the lo contribution and the nlo correction inside the @xmath21 cut  off contribute to the two  jet cross section together with the contributions inside the cone with radius @xmath15 .",
    "that part of the @xmath26 contribution not fulfilling the cone recombination condition stands for the 3jet cross section of which we have calculated the inclusive two  jet cross section as a function of @xmath2 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath2 is the transverse momentum of the measured jet or trigger jet with rapidity @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the rapidity of another jet so that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the jets with highest @xmath2 .",
    "for the two  jet cross section @xmath29 .",
    "this inclusive cross section is independent of the invariant mass parameter @xmath21 used to seperate those regions of phase space that contain the soft and collinear singularities .",
    "however the inclusive two  jet cross section depends on the cone size @xmath15 .",
    "if one of the two incoming photons interacts via the quark or the gluon component in its structure function we define @xmath30 this cross section has the same structure as the direct inclusive two  jet cross section for photoproduction @xmath31 , where the photon structure function in ( [ f2 ] ) is replaced by the proton structure function .",
    "this cross section has been calculated recently with the phase space slicing method with invariant mass cut slicing @xcite .",
    "the developed formulas for the two  jet photoproduction cross section can be transformed easily to the corresponding @xmath1@xmath1 process .",
    "the first term in each bracket of ( [ f2 ] ) is the lo cross section and @xmath32 , @xmath33 stand for the nlo corrections which depend on @xmath15 and the two scales @xmath34 ( renormalization ) and @xmath14 ( factorization ) .",
    "the cross section in ( [ f2 ] ) has two separate terms , depending whether the first or the second photon interacts through its structure function @xmath35 .",
    "when both photons are resolved we have @xmath36 this cross section has the same structure as the nlo resolved inclusive two  jet cross section for photoproduction @xmath37 , where the photon structure function at one vertex is replaced by the proton structure function . for this cross section the higher order corrections",
    "@xmath38 have not been calculated yet .",
    "however they are available for the inclusive single  jet cross section @xcite and are transformed to the @xmath1@xmath1 case . concerning the inclusive two  jet cross section in the double resolved case our strategy is as follows .",
    "first we have calculated the inclusive one  jet cross section in nlo , i.e.  with the terms @xmath39 , and have compared it with the lo cross section , so that we know the @xmath9 factor for the one  jet cross section .",
    "the same @xmath9 factor is applied to the two  jet cross section which is calculated in lo only . since for @xmath40 gev",
    "the dr contribution is less than 20% this estimate of the two  jet double resolved cross section is sufficient .",
    "it is obvious that the nlo corrections @xmath41 , @xmath32 and @xmath39 in ( [ f1 ] ) , ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) depend on the same kinematic variables @xmath2 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the lo cross sections .",
    "we specified only the dependence on the cone size @xmath15 , on the factorization scale @xmath14 and on the renormalization scale @xmath34 .    before we compare our results with the topaz and amy data we have made some tests of the nlo corrections to the one and two  jet cross sections .",
    "first we checked that these cross sections are independent of the cut  off @xmath21 if @xmath21 is chosen small enough .",
    "this was the case for @xmath42 in all considered cases .",
    "for @xmath21 above @xmath43 we observed some small @xmath21 dependence which is caused by our approximation that we neglected contributions @xmath44 in the analytical contribution to the two  jet cross section .",
    "second we tested that , first , the sum of nlo direct and the lo single resolved cross section and , second , the sum of the nlo single resolved cross section and the lo double resolved cross section are independent of the factorization scale @xmath14 .",
    "this test was performed for the one and two  jet cross section",
    "seperately under kinematic conditions as for the topaz data .",
    "similar checks were done earlier for the photoproduction one  jet cross section @xcite .",
    "in @xmath45 collisions at tristan the jets are produced via the exchange of two quasi  real photons .",
    "the spectrum of these small @xmath46 photons is described by the weizscker ",
    "williams approximation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the maximally allowed angle of the electron ( positron ) which experimentally is realized by the anti  tagging counters .",
    "@xmath49 is the beam energy of the electron ( positron ) and @xmath50 is the fraction of electron ( positron ) energy transferred to the respective photon .    in this approximation",
    "the inclusive two  jet cross section @xmath51 is obtained from @xmath52 where the cross section on the right  hand side stands for the interaction between two real photons .",
    "depending on the experimental conditions we encounter specific values for @xmath48 and eventually for the integration range of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , in ( [ f5 ] ) .    before presenting the results we must specify the parton distributions in the photon , @xmath35 , which appear in ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) .",
    "we have chosen the nlo set of glck , reya and vogt ( grv ) in the @xmath55 scheme @xcite . in @xcite the photon structure function is given in the so  called @xmath56 scheme . the transformation to the @xmath55 scheme is known and given in @xcite .",
    "this means that the direct , single resolved and double resolved cross section must also be calculated with the @xmath55 subtraction .",
    "we have tested that the @xmath57 scheme for the photon structure function of grv leads to the same results .",
    "we choose all scales @xmath58 and calculate @xmath59 from the two  loop formula with @xmath60 massless flavours with @xmath61 gev equal to the @xmath62 value of the nlo grv photon structure function . the charm quark is treated also as a light flavour with the boundary condition that the charm content of the photon structure function vanishes for @xmath63 ( @xmath64 gev ) .",
    "the topaz data are obtained for @xmath65 and @xmath53 , @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the rapidities of the two jets are restricted to @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the same input is used for the calculations of the nlo cross sections .",
    "our result for the inclusive single jet cross sections @xmath70 is shown as a function of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "we show four curves , the direct , single resolved , double resolved and the sum of all three components .",
    "all three cross sections are calculated up to nlo and the curve for the sum should be compared with the topaz points .",
    "the agreement is good at small @xmath2 . at larger @xmath2 ,",
    "where the theory is more trustworthy , the theoretical curve falls off stronger with increasing @xmath2 than the data .",
    "the error bars on the data include both statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the effects of the nlo corrections are as follows .",
    "if we compare with the lo result , where only the nlo corrections in the hard scattering are removed , i.e.  the lo cross section is calculated with the same nlo grv photon structure function as in the nlo computation we encounter the following @xmath9 factors : @xmath71 ( direct ) , @xmath72 ( single resolved ) , @xmath73 ( double resolved ) and @xmath74 1.0 ( sum ) factors for the special cone radius @xmath69 . for smaller or larger cone radii the @xmath9 factors would be completely different @xcite . ] .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath9 factor depends on the way the lo cross section is evaluated .",
    "if we use in lo the one  loop @xmath59 with the same @xmath62 value the @xmath9 factors are : @xmath71 ( d ) , @xmath71 ( sr ) , @xmath75 ( dr ) and @xmath71 ( sum ) . in fig .",
    "2b we have plotted the two  jet cross section @xmath76 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we show again the direct , single resolved , double resolved cross section and the sum of all three contributions . over the whole range of @xmath2",
    "the agreement with the topaz data is excellent .",
    "we notice that the double resolved cross section falls off with @xmath2 somewhat stronger in relation to the direct and single resolved components as in the one  jet cross section .",
    "the double resolved cross section is calculated in lo with the same @xmath9factor as obtained in the inclusive one  jet cross section .",
    "for the direct and single resolved cross section the @xmath9 factors for the one and two  jet cross section are approximately equal , so that we can expect this also for the double resolved cross section .",
    "the same plots but now with the kinematical contraints of the amy experimental data , @xmath77 , @xmath53 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the one  jet cross section and @xmath67 , @xmath80 for the two  jet cross section are shown in fig .",
    "all other input is as for the topaz curves .",
    "the @xmath9 factors are the same as for the topaz cross sections .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment for the one  jet data is somewhat better than in the topaz case .",
    "the low and high @xmath2 data points agree quite well . only in the intermediate range @xmath81 gev",
    "the measured cross section is smaller than the predicted cross section .",
    "the two  jet cross section agrees very well with the data for all @xmath2 .",
    "we observe that for both experiments the two  jet data agree somewhat better with our prediction than the one  jet data .",
    "this shows that the nlo cross sections correctly account for the experimental data .",
    "also the grv photon structure function which gives a good fit of existing inelastic @xmath82 scattering data produces the correct description of the single resolved and double resolved cross sections . before stronger conclusions can be drawn from the comparison one should investigate several effects that could influence our predictions .",
    "most of them would change the cross section noticeable only at small @xmath83 gev .",
    "such effects are , for example , corrections to the weizscker ",
    "williams approximation .",
    "part of these corrections have been studied in @xcite , including intrinsic @xmath2 effects caused by the non  zero momentum of the virtual photons .",
    "other corrections come from the non  vanishing charm mass or non  perturbative intrinsic @xmath2 effects in the photon structure functions .",
    "all these corrections , as far as they have been estimated @xcite , are below the experimental errors and most of them are relevant only at small @xmath2 .",
    "differential inclusive single and dijet cross sections @xmath84 have been calculated in nlo for the direct , single resolved and double resolved component as a function of @xmath2 . for the double resolved two  jet cross section the nlo corrections are estimated with a @xmath9 factor taken from the inclusive one  jet cross section .",
    "the sum of these cross sections are compared to the topaz and amy experimental data .",
    "we obtained good agreement between measured data and the theoretical predictions .",
    "for both experiments the two  jet data seem to agree better with the theory , than the one  jet data which may be due to the larger experimental errors of the two  jet data .",
    "the single and double resolved cross sections are obtained with the grv photon structure function which gives also good overall agreement with all measurements on @xmath85 . at large @xmath2 the direct and the single resolved components are the most important ones , so that only at smaller @xmath2 the photon structure function can be constrained by the double resolved component .    99    h.  hayashii et al . , topaz collaboration , phys .",
