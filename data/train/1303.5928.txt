    "we have studied the impact of nuclear effects and nonisoscalarity corrections on the extraction of the weak - mixing angle @xmath0 , using antineutrino and neutrino nucleus scattering .",
    "the calculations have been performed in a theoretical model using relativistic nuclear spectral functions which incorporate pauli blocking , fermi motion , binding energy and nucleon correlations .",
    "we have also included the pion and rho meson cloud contributions calculated from a microscopic model for meson - nucleus self - energies .",
    "the details of the model are given in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . paschos and wolfenstein(pw ) demonstrated that for an isoscalar target the ratio of neutral current to charged current cross sections is given by  @xcite : @xmath7 the above relation assumes no contribution from heavy quarks , symmetry between the strange quark and anti - strange quark and considers no medium effect and no contribution from outside the standard model .",
    "nutev collaboration  @xcite has extracted the weak mixing angle using the differential scattering cross section in the pw relation as eq .",
    "( [ pwrelation ] ) is also valid for differential cross section for an isoscalar nuclear target .",
    "the differential cross section for charged current ( anti)neutrino interaction with a nucleus is written as @xcite :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath10 is the mass of the w boson and @xmath11 is a lepton . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the four momentum of the incoming neutrino and outgoing lepton respectively and @xmath14 is the four momentum transfer .",
    "@xmath15 is the leptonic tensor tensor which is given as @xmath16 where plus sign is for antineutrino and minus sign is for neutrino .    in the local - density approximation",
    "the nuclear hadronic tensor @xmath17 can be written as a convolution of the nucleonic hadronic tensor with the hole spectral function . for a n@xmath18z nucleus like @xmath19 ,",
    "we have considered separate distributions of fermi sea for protons and neutrons@xcite:@xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the two different spectral functions , each one of them normalized to the number of protons or neutrons in the nuclear target and are functions of fermi momentum of protons and neutrons respectively which are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 pw ratio for nonisoscalar nucleus(@xmath26 ) in our model may be written in terms of pw ratio for the isoscalar nucleus(@xmath27 ) and the correction due to nonisoscalarity(@xmath28 )  @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 with    @xmath31    @xmath32~(u_v - d_v)\\right\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath33    @xmath34 } { 2m\\left(q^{2}-(q^{0})^{2}\\right)\\cdot(p\\cdot q)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the up and down valence quark distributions respectively .",

    "to see the effect of nonisoscalarity in iron target , we have plotted @xmath28 vs @xmath2 for different values of @xmath1 at anti(neutrino ) energy @xmath41 gev in fig .",
    "we find that the effect of non - isoscalarity is large at low @xmath2 and high @xmath1 which decreases with the increase in the value of @xmath2 .",
    "this effect is smaller at low values of @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have presented the dependence of isoscalar corrected @xmath0 on @xmath42 and @xmath3 as well as the effect of medium on the weak mixing angle .",
    "we observe that at low @xmath1 for @xmath43 gev and @xmath3=25 @xmath44 , @xmath0 is almost close to the standard value .",
    "the value of @xmath0 changes significantly with the change in @xmath42 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , we observe that there is a strong dependence on nuclear medium effects as well as nonisoscalarity corrections in the different regions of @xmath1 and @xmath3 . therefore , nonisoscalarity and nuclear medium effects are important in the extraction of @xmath0 , as well as it depends on at what ( anti)neutrino energies the evaluation is performed for a fixed @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
