    "the obtained currents are periodic functions of phase difference between superconductors with a period of @xmath81 .",
    "it is clarified that by increasing the thickness of normal layer , amplitude of currents decreases , which is understandable because by increasing thickness of the normal metal , quantum coherency of macroscopic phases between left and right superconductors decreases .",
    "the current - phase relations are qualitatively different from the case of @xmath82wave @xcite and @xmath83wave josephson junction @xcite . in particular , an interesting case is the zero of charge current at finite phase @xmath84 in fig.[fig2 ] ( b ) which occurs for the most of junctions exactly at @xmath85 or @xmath86 . on the other hand , for finite misorientation between left and",
    "right gap vectors even at the zero phase difference we obtain finite charge current . this is because according to eq .",
    "( [ axial ] ) in geometry ( ii ) misorientation @xmath15 plays role of phase difference rotation by @xmath15 gives the phase factor @xmath87 .",
    "also , in figs .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig6 ] , it is found that the spin current of josephson junction between two triplet superconductors has been created by misorientation between gap vectors of superconductors @xcite .",
    "for the case of geometry ( ii ) and axial state ( [ axial ] ) , spin current is absent because both of gap vectors are in the same direction .",
    "also , by using eq .",
    "( [ spin ] ) , we find that spin currents @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the axial state ( 12 ) and also the planar state ( 13 ) in geometry ( i ) , and spin currents @xmath59 and @xmath88 for the planar state ( 13 ) in geometry ( ii ) are absent .",
    "in contrast to the charge current , the spin current has a large value at @xmath86 ( or at @xmath85 for large misorientation angle ) .",
    "it is seen that charge current are generally odd function but spin current are even function of the phase difference because charge current is odd in time reversal while spin current is even . since spin",
    "current is an even function of phase , its derivative becomes odd in phase and hence should be zero at @xmath85 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the spin current has a local maximum or minimum at @xmath85 and @xmath1 .",
    "we also see that for some phases as @xmath86 the spin current exists but charge current disappears .",
    "this is a purely spin transport in the absence of charge current .",
    "this effect can not be observed in singlet superconducting junction like conventional or high @xmath89 superconductors . only in the case of superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor junction with inhomogeneous magnetization",
    "this spin current is present @xcite .",
    "the critical currents as a function of the misorientation angle are shown in figs.[fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .",
    "critical charge and spin currents , defined as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , are plotted as a function of misorientation angle @xmath15 for specified temperature and normal layer thickness ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) . by changing the misorientation",
    ", we see the @xmath92 transition due to the anisotropy of the gap.@xcite also , at the @xmath92 transition point for both symmetries in geometry ( i ) we have a jump of spin current due to the jump of the phase as found in ref.@xcite but in geometry ( ii ) there are nt any @xmath92 transition and hence jump of spin current .",
    "finally , in figs.[fig9]-[fig11 ] we have plotted the density of states in the normal region .",
    "it is known that proximity effect in the sns junction strongly changes the density of states in the normal metal . in our calculations , we obtained andreev bound states in the junctions as shown in figs.[fig9]-[fig11 ] .",
    "this is understandable , by interference effect of electrons and holes in the normal metal .",
    "an electron will be reflected by andreev reflection as a hole .",
    "this process is also repeated on the other sn interface .",
    "then , interference of holes and electrons increases the effective andreev reflection probability and proximity effect at the low energies .    in fig.[fig9 ] , we obtain a mini - gap like @xmath82wave and @xmath83wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "exactly at @xmath86 we obtain a peak at the fermi energy . here , like josephson junction between other types of unconventional superconductors @xcite , we obtain the finite density of states for energies inside the gap ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the results of a finite misorientation and different @xmath19 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the density of states gets smeared by increasing @xmath19 . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we plotted the density of states for both of geometries and both of symmetries .",
    "it is observed that by increasing the misorientation two peaks are gradually merged into one and there will be a peak at zero energy at @xmath94 .",
    "the increase of the density of states at low energy corresponds to that of the spin current .",
    "we find that effect of thickness of normal layer is only quantitative but misorientation changes currents and the density of states qualitatively .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated transport properties and also local density of states in triplet sns josephson junction with two @xmath0wave superconductors .",
    "a spin - polarized current normal to the interface is investigated theoretically .",
    "it is observed that normal layer decreases both of charge and spin currents .",
    "it is also found that misorientation of @xmath11-vector between left and right superconducting bulks produces the spin - polarized current which can flow even in the absence of charge current .",
    "we also unveiled a jump of the spin current associated with the 0-@xmath1 transition .",
    "in addition , density of states have been calculated for various phase difference , normal metal thickness and misorientation .",
    "normal metal thickness has only quantitative effect on the mid - gap states .",
    "misorientation of the @xmath11-vectors drastically changes the junction property .",
