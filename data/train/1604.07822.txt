    "* rl06 ) :    @xmath89      we ran ` cprops ` using the ` bootstrap ` flag , which calculates uncertainties on all quantities using a bootstrapping technique which we summarize here . in brief , for each cloud , the algorithm runs an additional 1000 independent times .",
    "each time , an artificial realization of the original data set is constructed by drawing @xmath51 sets of @xmath90 one at a time from the full distribution of these quantities in the original cloud , with repetition allowed . each moment ( @xmath91 , and @xmath81 ) is then computed , and the variations in moments across all 1000 realizations is taken to be the uncertainties in those moments .",
    "the uncertainties reported in table  [ tab : gmcprops ] are those computed through this bootstrap method .",
    "there are additional potential sources of uncertainty in the properties ` cprops ` reports . as a test of the reliability of extrapolated source sizes in the resolved subsample , we compared the fwhm major and minor axis lengths computed by ` cprops ` to those derived by a simple 2d gaussian spatial fit to the co integrated intensity map . for 2 of the 12 sources , a direct comparison was not possible , as 2d spatial fitting failed due to the integrated intensity map containing highly overlapping structures .",
    "for an additional 2 sources , the 2d gaussian fit was successful , but the fit had to include additional pixels beyond those in the cloud being compared , and thus the source sizes derived were significantly larger . for the remaining eight sources , 2d gaussian spatial fitting produced sources that appeared to reasonably represent the clouds ` cprops ` found .",
    "for these eight sources , 2d fitting leads to estimated fwhm major and minor axes on average 13% larger than the extrapolated moments from ` cprops ` , although there is a range in this difference from smaller by 20% to larger by 38% .",
    "position angles between these two methods always agree to within twice the reported uncertainty on position angle from the gaussian fitting procedure .",
    "the difference in fwhm axis lengths leads to an even larger discrepancy in deconvolved source sizes .",
    "source sizes computed from simple 2d fits are on average 50% larger than those from ` cprops ` , and as high as 140% larger in one case .",
    "this larger discrepancy comes from the nonlinearity of the deconvolution calculation  the more similar the observed size and beam size , the bigger a change in deconvolved source size due to a minor change in observed size .",
    "we thus caution that in addition to the uncertainties reported by ` cprops ` , there may be a 50% systematic uncertainty in source size .",
    "one source in particular deserves additional mention : dcl79 - 2 .",
    "it is the most massive gmc in our sample , and is resolved , but only marginally so ( its deconvolved minor axis is 0.8  ) .",
    "thus its deconvolved size is estimated to be only 10  pc , which causes it to fall significantly off the scaling relations expected for gmcs ( see ensuing sections ) .",
    "due to the extreme nonlinearity of the deconvolution algorithm when the source size is similar to the beam size , we performed a series of tests to assess any additional uncertainties that may have led to an underestimate of this source s size .",
    "for one , we find that even small changes in the position angle could lead to drastic changes in the deconvolved size : simply rotating the cloud by only 6@xmath92 leads to an increase in deconvolved size by a factor of two .",
    "another potential uncertainty is that this source shows an extremely high central concentration , and so the intensity - weighted spatial moments appear small compared to the extent of the source out to its 2@xmath38 contour .",
    "this may indicate that it follows a steeper relation than the @xmath93 assumed in the calculation of @xmath43 .",
    "we do not attempt to correct for these effects , but simply caution the reader that this source may appear to be an outlier in parameter spaces involving the size .",
    "investigation of the density profiles of gmcs in ngc  300 would help better address this issue , but will require higher resolution observations than those presented here .",
    "the effects discussed here for dcl79 - 2 are minimized in the other resolved sources in our sample because their deconvolved axis lengths are sufficiently large .",

    "we unfortunately do not have sufficient statistics to divide the sample by galactocentric radius and determine if there is a real difference in the mass spectrum slope between the inner and outer regions of the galaxy , as there appears to be in the milky way .",
    "comparing to other galaxies in which resolved gmc measurements are available , and assuming our sample of gmcs is representative of the full gmc population of ngc  300 , we find that ngc  300 s mass spectrum has a similar slope to that of the large magellanic cloud ( @xmath273 ; * ? ? ?",

    "our derived slope is also shallower than that of the mass spectrum across m51 ( @xmath277 ) , but again similar to the slope in m51 s spiral arms ( @xmath278 ; * ? ? ?",
    "since we are specifically targeting regions with active star formation , our sample likely better resembles the inner galaxy and spiral arm samples in the galaxies discussed above rather than the more diffuse outer milky way or m33 . as @xcite point out",
    ", galactic environment can play a strong role in shaping the gmc mass spectrum , to the point that the slope changes significantly with environment ( for example , becoming steeper with increasing galactocentric radius ) .",
    "this can be interpreted theoretically as a change in the relative formation and destruction times of molecular clouds such that in more diffuse regions , the lack of availability of dense material leads to an increase in formation time while the destruction time remains relatively constant @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the mass spectrum of gmc complexes ( at 250 pc scales ) in ngc 300 to have a very steep slope of @xmath279 above a completeness limit of @xmath280 .",
    "however , they did not resolve individual clouds , and we can see from our data that each apex gmc complex breaks up into two or more gmcs at high resolution .",
    "furthermore , only 4 of the 45 clouds in our sma sample have individual masses higher than the completeness limit from @xcite ) , so we are clearly probing different mass regimes as well as size scales .",
    "further studies of ngc  300 will be necessary to connect these differing regimes and assess whether the gmc and gmc complex mass spectra are related .",
    "@xcite first demonstrated the existence of empirical relations between the size , linewidth , and luminosity of gmcs in the milky way . in the first such relation ,",
    "the linewidth scales with approximately the square root of the size @xcite , i.e.    @xmath281    this relation reflects the equilibrium conditions of supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds : turbulence appears to be injected on large scales and cascades down to smaller scales , decreasing in kinetic energy as it does so .",
    "the mechanisms that inject and maintain this turbulence are still debated , and may include feedback from newly formed stars , energy from supernova explosions , and/or galaxy - scale effects including spiral shocks and shear instabilities .",
    "regardless of the origins , it has somewhat surprisingly been shown that a size - linewidth relation holds amongst gmcs in many nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although m51 at least appears to be an exception @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that there is some universality in the turbulent equilibria of the molecular ism in many galaxies , independent of spiral galaxy mass and morphology .",
    "we present the size - linewidth relation for the resolved subsample in ngc  300 in figure  [ fig : larson1 ] , compared with milky way gmcs from the five colleges radio astronomy observatory galactic ring survey ( grs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the m33 gmc sample of @xcite . note that the grs sample consists of the same clouds from @xcite but with properties recomputed based on higher resolution data , and also utilizing @xmath6co observations instead of @xmath0co .",
    "we take the grs cloud properties to be accurate , and thus for the relation shown in figure  [ fig : larson1 ]",
    ", we have recomputed the intercept in equation  ( [ eqn : sizelinewidth ] ) using the grs data .",
    "the ngc 300 gmcs appear consistent in their sizes and linewidths to those in the milky way and m33 .",
    "taken alone , our data suggest an increasing trend between size and linewidth , and we perform an orthogonal distance regression on the logarithms of these quantities in the resolved subsample to determine the best - fit power law relation between them . to perform the fitting",
    ", we utilize the ` scipy.odr ` package , which accounts for errors in both variables .",
    "we use the @xcite relation to provide initial guesses for the parameters @xmath282 and @xmath283 to the equation @xmath284 .",
    "the formal best fit relation in the ngc  300 clouds is @xmath285 this exponent , while uncertain , is fully consistent with the value of 0.5 found by @xcite for the milky way , and within the uncertainties of the @xcite value for nearby galaxies .",
    "thus quantitatively as well as qualitatively , the size - linewidth relation in ngc  300 is in agreement with the general trend in disk galaxies in the local universe , including the milky way .",
    "we do note that the relatively large uncertainties in ` cprops`-derived size and linewidth and limited dynamic range in our sample make it difficult to draw firm conclusions as to the physical implications of the size - linewidth correlation beyond the general empirical trend discussed above .",
    "further high - resolution studies in ngc  300 are needed to better constrain these gmc parameters and improve the dynamic range in cloud properties .",
    "larson s third relation ( and the second we discuss here ) , which originally related the average volume densities and sizes of clouds , has received much attention recently in the literature .",
    "larson found that the volume density @xmath286 scaled with size roughly as    @xmath287    i.e. the mass scales as size like @xmath288 .",
    "one key implication is that the column density @xmath289 of gmcs , which goes as @xmath290 , is approximately constant",
    ". showed that , using high - fidelity near - infrared extinction maps to trace cloud column densities , the value of this constant surface density is @xmath291  pc@xmath5 , with very little scatter in the relation .",
    "this result is based on analysis in which the cloud is considered to extend out to an extinction threshold of @xmath292  mag in the @xmath293-band .",
    "@xcite find a similar value of 42  @xmath253  pc@xmath5 when re - analyzing the gmcs from the @xcite sample in a consistent manner using grs @xmath6co data .",
    "we present the mass - size relation in the resolved subsample in ngc  300 in figure  [ fig : larson2 ] , again compared to milky way grs data and m33 .",
    "we again find that the ngc  300 data are consistent with the mass - size relation in the milky way and m33 .",
    "the median surface density in our sample is 54  @xmath294  pc@xmath5 , slightly higher than the milky way average  .",
    "we also note that surface densities in our sample range widely , from 15 to 125  @xmath294  pc@xmath5 , but with very large uncertainties ( factors of one to a few ) .",
    "this discrepancy may reflect more on the large potential systematic uncertainties in deconvolved sizes ( see section  [ sec : uncertainties ] ) , which enter the surface density calculation to the power of two , than on any intrinsic variation of surface density in gmcs .",
    "we note that one gmc , dcl79 - 2 , appears to have an exceptionally high surface density , but this is likely a result of its size being underestimated ( see section  [ sec : uncertainties ] ) .",
    "we present the final larson s relation , the mass - linewidth relation , for ngc  300 in figure  [ fig : larson3 ] , as only two of the three larson relations are independent , it follows naturally that since the ngc  300 resolved subsample shows similar behavior to gmcs in the size - linewidth and mass - size relations in other galaxies ( including the milky way ) , it also is similar in the mass - linewidth relation .",
    "we attempted to fit power law functions to the mass - size and mass - linewidth relations , but the large uncertainties in these quantities led to indeterminate fits .      with both pure interferometric and single dish data of the same regions",
    ", we can compare our results directly with those of the apex survey of @xcite to assess what fraction of the single dish flux we recover with the sma . to make this comparison , we perform the following procedure on the sma primary beam - corrected data cubes .",
    "first , we mask all pixels ( each of which is a one - dimensional spectrum ) in the data cubes that do not show significant co emission .",
    "specifically , we require for inclusion that a pixel have at least one velocity channel in the spectral region including the line exhibiting emission greater than twice the spectral rms .",
    "the spectral region here is taken to include all channels within twice the apex spectral fwhm on either side of the apex line center , as determined by single gaussian fits to the apex spectra .",
    "the spectral rms is calculated from the portion of the spectrum outside this region .",
    "this criterion ensures that we do not include pixels in the spectral sum that are purely noise .",
    "next , we multiply each plane of the sma primary beam - corrected data cube by the apex beam profile , which we approximate as a @xmath295 fwhm circular gaussian , centered at the apex pointing position .",
    "then , we sum all unmasked pixels in each plane over a circular region the size of the sma primary beam , and the sequence of all such planes forms the sma spectrum .",
    "finally , we use the trapezoidal rule to numerically integrate this spectrum over a velocity range encompassing twice the apex spectral fwhm and centered at the apex central velocity to determine the apex - attenuated sma integrated intensity , @xmath296 .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath297 on @xmath296 is given formally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by @xmath298 where @xmath299 is the number of channels across @xmath300 , the velocity range over which the integration is performed , and @xmath301 is the velocity width of a channel .",
    "@xmath302 is calculated as the quadrature sum of the line - free spectral rms and the 20% flux calibration uncertainty .",
    "the fraction of the apex integrated intensity recovered by the sma , @xmath303 , is then finally @xmath304 and the uncertainty is computed by propagating uncertainties in the standard way .",
    "we take @xmath305 and the corresponding uncertainty directly from @xcite .",
    "the mean recovered fraction is @xmath306 , which demonstrates that our sma observations do not generally recover the full emission detected by apex .",
    "one likely cause could be the relative sensitivities of the apex and sma observations combined with our masking procedure .",
    "the apex observations have a median rms noise of 11  mk per 1.389  km  s@xmath1 channel @xcite , while these sma observations have an rms of 27  mk when scaled to the same channel velocity width .",
    "thus there may be real co emission ( e.g. , from low - mass gmcs ) that contributes to the apex spectrum that we are simply not sensitive enough to detect with the sma .",
    "observations with increased sensitivity and better angular resolution would be likely to detect such clouds if they exist ( e.g. , rosolowsky et al . 2013 ) .",
    "another possibility is that there is diffuse and extended co emission that is resolved out due to incomplete @xmath18,@xmath19 coverage of the sma observations .",
    "the shortest baseline of 16.4 m corresponds to a maximum recoverable size scale of 16  , which is about 150 pc at the distance of ngc 300 .",
    "although we should recover most of the apex emission with a characteristic scale size smaller than this , diffuse emission with @xmath307  pc scales would be filtered out in our sma observations .",
    "however , it seems implausible that diffuse emission could explain the entire discrepancy for the lowest @xmath303 regions , as this would imply that more than 50% of the co emission detected by apex is extended , diffuse emission . indeed in the milky way , only about 25% of the global molecular gas reservoir is in diffuse form  @xcite , and much of this is likely less extended than 150  pc .",
    "we note that @xmath303 does vary on a region - by - region basis , from 0.32 ( dcl88 - 52 ) to about unity ( dcl88 - 137b ) across the sample .",
    "we examine potential causes of this variation in @xmath303 visually in figure  [ fig : smaapex ] , which shows @xmath303 as a function of four parameters : ( 1 ) the 250  pc scale apex region molecular mass ; ( 2 ) galactocentric radius ; ( 3 ) the 250  pc scale sfr ; and , ( 4 ) @xmath296 .",
    "@xmath303 is flat with apex region mass ( which is proportional to @xmath305 ) .",
    "this indicates that there is no systematic trend in how much emission the sma recovers with single dish integrated intensity .",
    "there is also no correlation in @xmath303 with galactocentric radius .",
    "there is a hint of a trend is in the @xmath303-sfr relation at moderate to high sfrs : above @xmath308  yr@xmath1 , the fraction of single dish emission recovered appears to increase with the region s sfr .",
    "finally , there is a clear trend in @xmath303 with @xmath296 .",
    "this latter trend may result from a systematic variation in the relative amounts of emission from large gmcs detected by both apex and sma and some combination of low mass gmcs and potentially some diffuse molecular gas detected only in the apex observations . in regions with very bright co emission ( massive gmcs ) ,",
    "emission from these bright regions dominates and so the relative contribution of the low - level emission is small , leading to a higher @xmath303 .",
    "conversely , in regions with only moderate mass gmcs , the relative contribution of the undetected emission can be significant , as suggested by @xmath303 lower than 50% .",
    "we also briefly speculate here on a potential physical origin for the weak @xmath303-sfr trend at moderate to high sfrs .",
    "one explanation is that regions having the majority of their molecular gas in large , massive gmcs are more actively star - forming than regions where the majority of molecular gas is exterior to large gmcs .",
    "feedback from active star formation is energetically capable of efficiently disrupting diffuse molecular gas and small , low mass gmcs in short timescales through a high flux of ultraviolet radiation .",
    "thus in the most actively star - forming regions ( those with the highest sfrs ) , feedback is effectively disrupting the majority of the diffuse gas or low - mass gmcs that were present , while the molecular gas in massive gmcs ( i.e. , those we have the sensitivity to detect ) is shielded enough to remain in the harsh radiation field for significant timescales . in quiescent ( low sfr ) regions ,",
    "diffuse gas and low - mass gmcs may be able to better survive due to the weaker radiation fields present .",
    "the disagreement with the trend for the very lowest sfrs ( below @xmath308  yr@xmath1 ) may be ( 1 ) a result of these regions being in an earlier ( pre - star forming ) state of evolution ( and thus sfrs underestimated using the method that relies on tracers of young massive stars ) , but with the majority of their gas bound in gmcs that will soon but has not yet formed stars , or ( 2 ) a sign that the trend discussed above is not universal .",
    "in this study we have mapped the @xmath0co emission at @xmath251  pc spatial and @xmath309  km  s@xmath1 spectral resolution in eleven star forming regions in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc  300 with the submillimeter array .",
    "we used the ` cprops ` algorithm with physically motivated priors to identify gmcs within our @xmath0co data cubes and compute their masses , linewidths , and ( where possible ) sizes .",
    "we find that the co emission seen as a single pixel in the apex survey of @xcite is resolved into two or more discreet gmcs in each region .",
    "our sample consists of 45 total gmcs , 12 of which are spatially resolved ( the `` resolved subsample '' ) .    1 .",
    "we extracted spectra from each gmc , and find that the majority of spectra are well - fit by a single gaussian , suggesting that these gmcs are indeed individual clouds to the limit of our spectral resolution .",
    "two of the resolved subsample appear to show evidence for multiple emission components and therefore we may have overestimated their actual line widths and virial masses in this analysis .",
    "we detect @xmath6co in four of the most massive clouds in the sample , and in those clouds find an average @xmath0co/@xmath6co flux ratio of 6.2 .",
    "we find that masses derived directly from co luminosity and virial masses are in relative agreement for those gmcs without evidence for multiple spectral emission components .",
    "this suggests that the majority of the ngc  300 clouds are virialized , similarly to gmcs in the milky way and other nearby galaxies .",
    "the exception , dcl79 - 2 , likely has a size underestimated by ` cprops ` and potentially a steep mass density profile .",
    "we fit the gmc mass spectrum in this sample of ngc  300 clouds and derive a slope of @xmath310 .",
    "this value is intermediate between the slopes of the mass spectra in the inner ( @xmath311 ) and outer ( 2.1 ) milky way , and similar to the mass spectrum slopes in the inner regions of m33 ( 1.6 ) and in the spiral arms of m51 ( 1.8 ) .",
    "since our sample consists of gmcs near regions and at galactocentric radii less than 4 kpc , this result suggests a similarity in mass spectrum slope in inner galaxy star - forming environments across galaxies .",
    "the resolved subsample shows consistency with the @xcite size - linewidth , mass - size , and mass - linewidth relations seen in the milky way and many other galaxies .",
    "we fit the resolved subsample data using orthogonal distance regression fitting and find a statistical significant trend of @xmath3 .",
    "this result is in agreement with studies of other nearby galaxies , though our data preclude any conclusive statements regarding the origin and nature of the turbulence in gmcs .",
    "the surface densities of the resolved clouds range from 25 to 125  @xmath253  pc@xmath5 , with a median of 54  @xmath253  pc@xmath5 , similar to gmc surface densities in milky way clouds .",
    "the fraction of the apex single dish integrated intensity we recover with the sma ranges from 30% to nearly 100% across our sample .",
    "low detection fractions are likely due to being unable to detect low - mass gmcs with our limited sensitivity observations as compared with the single dish measurements , and also possibly the presence of some diffuse gas .",
    "the sma / apex integrated intensity ratio is not correlated with the apex molecular mass or galactocentric radius .",
    "there is however a trend with the sma integrated intensity , suggesting systematic variation in the contribution of massive gmcs to the total co intensity of the region .",
    "in addition , for regions with star formation rates larger than @xmath308  yr@xmath1 , we tend to recover a higher fraction of the single dish flux in regions with high sfrs than in those with low sfrs .",
    "this result could be explained by the dissociation of low mass clouds and diffuse gas due to energetic ultraviolet radiation from the many newly formed massive stars in the high sfr regions .    to test these conclusions , additional high - resolution observations of a larger sample size of ngc  300 clouds will be needed . with the resolution and sensitivity of alma , for example",
    ", the entire gmc sample of @xmath312 regions from @xcite could be studied at @xmath313  pc resolution in a very reasonable amount of observing time .",
    "such studies will be crucial to understanding the general properties and broad populations of gmcs .",
    "the authors owe their deepest gratitude to nimesh patel for tireless guidance on the use of ` mir - idl ` and ` miriad ` for sma data reduction and imaging .",
