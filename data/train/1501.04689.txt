    "topological insulators @xcite ( ti ) represent a novel state of quantum matter that comes about due to the combined effects of spin - orbit interactions and time - reversal symmetry . @xcite",
    "though characterized by a bulk band gap , they are adiabatically distinct from ordinary insulators and support protected gapless surface states . in the case of a three - dimensional strong ti , these surface states form a novel two - dimensional topological metal with a spin - polarized massless dirac energy spectrum . the theoretical prediction and subsequent experimental discovery of ti states in 2d materials @xcite ( hgte / cdte quantum wells ) , 3d materials @xcite ( bi@xmath7sb@xmath8 ) , and the cleaner , simpler , second generation 3d materials @xcite ( bi@xmath9se@xmath10 , bi@xmath9te@xmath10 , and sb@xmath9te@xmath10 ) has led to great interest in this area , exploring both the fundamental physics as well as the potential for applications to fault - tolerant topological quantum computation @xcite .    the proximity of either magnetic materials or superconductors to the ti surface can induce an energy gap in the topological metal , resulting in even more exotic interface states . @xcite early on , fu and kane @xcite considered the proximity effect at the interface between a ti and a conventional @xmath11-wave superconductor , analyzing the proximity - induced superconducting interface state and finding that it should support majorana bound states @xcite at vortices .",
    "subsequent work has expanded this analysis in many directions , and has included the case of tis proximity - coupled to unconventional superconductors of different pairing symmetries @xcite .",
    "such ti interface state superconductivity has been demonstrated , experimentally , both for the @xmath11-wave case @xcite and for the case of tis coupled to high-@xmath12 cuprate @xmath13-wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "it is this last case , that of the proximity - induced superconducting state at the interface of a 3d strong topological insulator ( ti ) and a @xmath13-wave superconductor ( dsc ) , that is our focus here . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider a ti with a surface state characterized by a single dirac point at the origin of @xmath14-space , as is seen in the bi@xmath9se@xmath10 family of materials @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in the low energy quasiparticle excitations of this interface state , a system in which massless dirac fermions enter in two different ways , as both the surface states of the ti and the quasiparticles of the dsc . for the former ,",
    "the ti surface states , the massless dirac fermions are isotropic , a consequence of band structure , and not pinned to the fermi surface , such that one can tune through the dirac point by varying the chemical potential .",
    "they are described by a dirac equation where the gamma matrices live in @xmath15 spin space . for the latter , the dsc quasiparticle states , the massless dirac fermions are anisotropic , their energy spectrum squeezed in @xmath14-space , and are pinned to the fermi surface at four nodal points .",

    "the ti - dsc interface state that we consider mixes both spin and particle - hole space and will have quasiparticle excitations of its own , with features inherited from both of the above .",
    "a useful probe for studying massless dirac quasiparticles in @xmath13-wave superconductors has been low temperature thermal transport @xcite , measurements of which can be extrapolated to the particularly simple and interesting regime where temperature , @xmath16 , is small compared to the impurity scattering rate , @xmath17 .",
    "this is known as the universal limit because thermal conductivity due to massless dirac quasiparticles has been shown to be insensitive to disorder in this very low temperature regime .",

    "though the hamiltonian for this interface state couples particle to hole and spin - up to spin - down , its quasiparticles carry a well - defined heat .",
    "thus , thermal transport tracks quasiparticle transport , and is therefore well - suited to probing the excitations of this system . for @xmath19 , it probes the single isotropic dirac node inherited from the ti surface . for @xmath20 , it probes the four anisotropic dirac nodes resulting from proximity - induced @xmath13-wave superconductivity .",

    "since we are primarily interested in understanding the essential physics of this transition , without delving too deeply into the material - dependent details , we proceed by considering the following simple and rather standard expression for the order parameter of a generic @xmath13-wave superconductor @xmath218 which yields a gap velocity at @xmath55 of the form @xmath219 here , we have introduced two new model parameters , the gap maximum @xmath220 and the lattice constant @xmath221 . expressing all lengths in units of @xmath221 and all energies in units of @xmath222 , we define dimensionless parameters @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 , as well as a dimensionless wavevector with components @xmath226 and @xmath227 . doing so , plugging eqs .",

    "our numerical result matches the large-@xmath0 expression for @xmath20 , peaking with decreasing @xmath5 , before plunging down toward the small-@xmath5 value for @xmath19 .",

    "[ fig : integ_nozoom ] illustrates the structure of the large-@xmath0 limit . here , for @xmath234",
    ", the integrand is peaked within @xmath235 of four , well - separated , anisotropic nodal points .",
    "equal - intensity contours are ( nearly ) elliptical , squeezed in the direction parallel to the local fermi surface . in the middle panel , @xmath0 is reduced by a factor of 2 , which draws the nodes closer to the origin .",
    "the peaks are still well - separated , but less so than before , since the radius of the fermi circle has decreased and the nodal anisotropy ratio has increased .",
    "thus , the peaks have begun to curve around the fermi circle , toward each other , and the independent node approximation used to derive the large-@xmath5 expression of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa0largemu ] ) has begun to break down . in the lower panel , @xmath0 is reduced by an additional factor of 10 .",
    "now the independent node approximation has completely broken down , and the four anisotropic peaks have curved into each other , forming an annulus of width @xmath235 about the fermi circle . with decreasing @xmath0 , the radius of this annular peak decreases , resulting in the decrease of @xmath18 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa0vsmu_limits ] .",
    "we reproduce this image , zoomed - in about the annulus , in the upper panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : integ_nozoom ] . in the middle panel of that figure , @xmath0 is reduced by another factor of 10 , such that it is nearly equal to @xmath17 .",
    "now the width and radius of the annular peak are nearly equal .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases further , the system is tuned toward the dirac point inherited from the ti surface state and the isotropic node at the origin is revealed . for @xmath19 , the annular peak blurs into a single isotropic peak at the origin , of width @xmath235 .",
    "this is shown in the lower panel where @xmath236 .",
    "the integral over this single isotropic peak recovers the small-@xmath5 value of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa0smallmu ] ) .",
    "as @xmath0 becomes negative , the process reverses , dominated now by the @xmath181 branch of the quasiparticle excitation spectrum instead of the @xmath179 branch .",
    "all else is the same , so @xmath18 is even in @xmath0 .",
    "results for five different values of the impurity scattering rate , @xmath17 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa0vsmu_multipleg0 ] .",
    "note that in both the large-@xmath5 and small-@xmath5 limits , @xmath18 is disorder - independent .",
    "the transition between these limits does , however , depend on disorder , with the peaks of the @xmath18 vs @xmath0 curves smoothed out for greater disorder .",
    "this effect can be understood in terms of our integrand analysis ( above ) . as @xmath5 decreases from its largest values , increasing anisotropy ratio yields increasing @xmath18 via our large-@xmath5 expression , eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa0largemu ] ) .",
    "but for greater disorder , the independent node approximation that defines the large-@xmath5 limit breaks down sooner , as the four anisotropic peaks broaden with growing disorder and merge together earlier , limiting the enhancement of @xmath18 with increasing anisotropy ratio .",
    "the resulting annular peak is of greater width for greater disorder and therefore blurs into a single peak sooner , ushering in the small-@xmath5 limit as its radius becomes smaller than its width .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the universal - limit thermal conductivity , @xmath237 , as a function of chemical potential , @xmath0 , due to quasiparticle excitations of the proximity - induced superconducting state at the 2d interface of a topological insulator and a @xmath13-wave superconductor . in both the large-@xmath5 and small-@xmath5 limits",
    ", we have obtained simple closed - form expressions for @xmath18 , combined here from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kappa0largemu ] ) and ( [ eq : kappa0smallmu ] ) @xmath238 where @xmath25 is the slope of the isotropic dirac cone inherited from the ti surface state , @xmath203 is the @xmath0-dependent anisotropy ratio of the four anisotropic dirac cones of the proximity - induced @xmath13-wave superconducting state , and @xmath17 is the impurity scattering rate , the energy scale characterizing disorder in the system . note that the large-@xmath5 expression is exactly half the value obtained @xcite ( per layer ) for an ordinary @xmath13-wave superconductor : @xmath239 .",
    "this is an overt demonstration of the sense in which the underlying topological metal is `` half '' of an ordinary metal @xcite , and comes about because , for large @xmath5 , only one of the two branches ( positive or negative ) of the isotropic dirac cone contributes at a time . for @xmath19 ,",
    "both branches contribute , but the four nodes have coalesced into one isotropic node at the origin of @xmath14-space .",
    "thus , the small-@xmath5 expression is equal to the standard dsc value ( with anisotropy ratio equal to one ) , divided by four ( since there is only one node instead of the usual four ) : @xmath240 . while @xmath18 is disorder - independent in both of these limits , the transition between them , as a function of @xmath0 , depends on disorder . and",
    "furthermore , it depends , in the details , on the functional form of the proximity - induced order parameter , @xmath35 . adopting a simple model for @xmath35 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltakmodel ] ) ) , we have calculated @xmath18 across the full range of @xmath0 , for different levels of disorder , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa0vsmu_multipleg0 ] . as @xmath0 decreases from its maximum value , the four nodal peaks of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa0num ] ) become more anisotropic , resulting in an increase in @xmath18 , as per our large-@xmath5 expression .",
    "but they also move closer together , eventually merging into an annular peak about the fermi circle .",
    "along the way , the independent node approximation that defined the large-@xmath5 limit breaks down , and @xmath18 reaches its maximum value , decreasing as @xmath0 decreases further and the fermi circle shrinks .",
    "finally , as @xmath0 gets smaller than @xmath17 , the annular peak blurs into an isotropic nodal peak at the origin , and @xmath18 reaches its minimum at the value given by our small-@xmath5 expression . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa0vsmu_multipleg0 ] , the peaks in the @xmath18 vs @xmath0 curve are more pronounced for smaller @xmath17 , smoothing out with increasing disorder .",
    "note that we have assumed herein that the bulk band gap of the topological insulator extends well above and below the dirac point of the surface state , such that @xmath0 could be varied over a wide range of energies without accessing the bulk valence or conduction bands . in real materials ,",
    "the available energy windows may be more restricted .",
    "we have also assumed that the chemical potential can be accurately controlled , via gating , doping , or other means , and that proper contact can be made to the ti - dsc interface .",
    "both may present experimental challenges .",
    "our focus in this work has been on the evolution with changing chemical potential of the massless dirac quasiparticle excitations of the ti - dsc interface state .",
    "results shed light on the essential features of low - temperature thermal transport due to these quasiparticles .",
    "further theoretical development , including incorporation of a subdominant spin - triplet order parameter , a more realistic disorder model , and vertex corrections to our diagrammatic calculation , are left for future work .",
