    "one of the powerful techniques for probing the dynamic state of driven vortex matter in type ii superconductors is the mode locking ( ml ) experiment .",
    "ml is a dynamic resonance between a superimposed rf drive and the dynamic lattice mode ( as expected to appear when vortices flow coherently in a ( random ) pinning environment ) excited collectively at the internal ( washboard ) frequency @xmath0 with @xmath1 integer , @xmath2 the average dc velocity and @xmath3 the lattice spacing of the array along the flow direction .",
    "when @xmath4 and the rf drive frequency @xmath5 are harmonically related , i.e. , @xmath6 with @xmath7 integer , the resonance appears as steps in the dc current - voltage ( @xmath8 ) characteristics and also emerges more sensitively as jumps ( dips ) in a real ( imaginary ) part of rf impedance at low rf drives @xmath9 @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "so far , some features of the ml phenomenon have been well studied in sliding charge density waves in quasi one dimensional conductors @xcite .",
    "it turns out that complete ml features characterized by `` perfect '' steps in dc @xmath10 curve appear when the flow is coherent enough , whereas incomplete features like rounded and broadened steps in the @xmath10 curve appear if the flow becomes more incoherent .",
    "thus , the ml feature provides information on the amount of coherency in the flow . in this study , we have employed the ml technique to study flow of vortices driven through disordered mesoscopic channels @xcite .",
    "the channel device consists of a strong pinning nbn film ( thickness @xmath11=50 nm ) on top of a weakly pinning amorphous nb@xmath12ge@xmath13 film ( @xmath11=550 nm and @xmath140.3 ) . by reactive ion etching and proper masking ,",
    "straight channels were etched leaving a 300 nm thick nbge layer .",
    "the width and length of each channel is 230 nm and 300@xmath15 m , respectively .",
    "the pinning potential for vortices inside the channel is dominated by the interaction with strongly pinned edge vortices which form a disordered configuration ( see the inset to fig.1 ) .",
    "the transport current is applied perpendicular to the channel and drives the vortices along the channel . for ml experiments",
    ", we sweep the dc current with a constant superimposed rf current and record both the in- and out - of - phase part of the rf - voltage as well as the dc voltage .",
    "the sample was immersed in superfluid @xmath16he at a temperature of 1.9k .",
    "because of the confinement of the vortex array in the channels , an integer number @xmath17 of rows is expected to form inside each channel . in a previous study",
    ", we demonstrated that the flow configuration can be related to the voltage @xmath18 at which the fundamental ml ( @xmath19 ) occurs @xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath20 with @xmath21 the flux quantum and @xmath22 ) the number of channels .",
    "in fig.1 we plot the real part of the rf - impedance @xmath23 versus the dc voltage @xmath24 taken at several magnitudes of rf currents @xmath25 of 6mhz .",
    "we choose a field of 170mt where moving configurations of @xmath17=4 rows form in each channel .",
    "around @xmath26v we observe rounded jumps , while below and above @xmath18 @xmath23 increases monotonically with @xmath24 .",
    "it is clear that the height and the voltage broadening of the rounded jump are enhanced when @xmath25 is reduced . for definition of the jump height @xmath27 , we take the derivative of @xmath23-@xmath24 curve and integrate over the corresponding peak in a differential plot of @xmath28 versus @xmath24 .",
    "the inset to fig.2 shows a plot of @xmath27 as a function of @xmath25 . by decreasing @xmath25 , @xmath29 first increases and",
    "then levels off at low @xmath25 .",
    "thus , @xmath29 is `` ohmic '' at low @xmath25 , consistent with the fiory experiment @xcite and theory @xcite .",
    "next we turn to the voltage broadening @xmath30 of the rounded jump .",
    "figure 2 shows the rf current dependence of @xmath30 .",
    "we determine @xmath30 by taking the full width at half maximum of the peak in the differential plot .",
    "it is clear that , with reducing @xmath25 , @xmath30 increases monotonically and seems to diverge at @xmath310 .",
    "since @xmath29 is constant , this indicates that the jump is smeared out toward @xmath32 .",
    "such divergence of @xmath30 implies a pronounced spread in the internal frequency , i.e. , a wide distribution of local velocities and/or lattice spacings .",
    "in fact , we find that no narrow band noise at @xmath4 is detectable in the dc vortex flow",
    ". with increasing @xmath25 , however , the spread in @xmath4 gradually decreases .",
    "this can be explained by the frequency pulling effect where the distribution of @xmath4 narrows and becomes locked into @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "thus , with increasing rf drive , the ml gradually enhances the order of the moving vortex lattice .    at high rf drives ,",
    "the ml jumps in the @xmath33 curves disappear .",
    "therefore , we determined @xmath30 from the measured current steps in the dc @xmath8 curves .",
    "the open symbols in fig.2 show that this @xmath30 first decreases monotonically and then levels off at large @xmath25 .",
    "this indicates that complete ( characterized by @xmath30=0 ) ml does not occur , even at high rf drives .",
    "since @xmath30 is more than one decade larger than what is expected for purely elastic deformations @xcite , we conclude that slip between moving rows and possibly remaining plastic regions in the channel partially influence the ml characteristics .",
    "this plasticity is caused by the disordered vortex configurations in the channel edges .",
