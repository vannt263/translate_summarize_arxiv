    "the granular materials investigated are cylindrical compacts made by uniaxial compression of powders based on microcrystalline cellulose ( mcc ) , lactose or calcium phosphate .",
    "all samples have a diameter of 13 mm and a total weight of 500 mg .",
    "the compaction force applied varied between 5 and 55 kn , and thickness were between 1.9 and 3.5 mm .",
    "the mcc - samples represent realistic pharmaceutical wet granulated compacts , and were manufactured from three different granule size fractions a , b and c ( granules being @xmath0 @xmath1 m , @xmath2 @xmath1 m and @xmath3 @xmath1 m , respectively ) .",
    "lactose and calcium phosphate samples were , on the other hand , made from pure powders ( 5 - 10 @xmath1 m mean particle size ) . for reference , we also make experiments on homogenous isotropic turbid materials with scattering properties similar to those of the granular samples",
    ". these are spectralon ( a commercially available porous fluoropolymer ) , a macroporous sintered alumina ceramic @xcite , and a tio@xmath4-based epoxy phantom @xcite .",
    "light transport is investigated by conducting spatially resolved photon time - of - flight spectroscopy ( ptofs ) .",
    "short ( picosecond ) pulses of 760 nm light are injected into the tablets at the radial position @xmath5 using a @xmath6m - core graded - index optical fiber , and light transmitted through the sample is detected at the radial positions @xmath7 using a second identical fiber ( radial positions defined relative to the sample center ) .",
    "a key parameter in measurements is the radial ( transverse ) source - detector separation , @xmath8 .",
    "the collected light consist of pulses that are temporally broadened due to multiple scattering , and the detection fiber direct these pulses to a fast photomultiplier that combined with time - correlated single photon counting allows us to resolve them in time .",
    "details on the spectroscopic instrument is available in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the experimental configuration is elaborated in figure [ fig : setup ] .    .",
    "sideway translation of the source fiber allows tuning of @xmath5 .",
    "part ( b ) shows how transverse translation of sample and ring allow simultaneous tuning of @xmath7 and @xmath5 , a configurations used for investigation of sample homogeneity ( keeping @xmath9).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    to avoid being very close to the edge of the samples ( sample radii being 6.5 mm ) , measurements were conducted up to @xmath10 mm . for the most strongly scattering samples ,",
    "however , there was an upper limit to @xmath11 above which the signal is so weak so that stray light distorts obtained time - of - flight ( tof ) histograms . in calcium phosphate samples and the porous alumina , for example ,",
    "light completely change its direction on average each every @xmath12 m ( i.e. , the transport mean free path of light is around @xmath12 m ) . the resulting high reflectivity and strong attenuation limits us to measurements up to @xmath11 of  3 mm . at larger @xmath11 ,",
    "measurements are susceptible of stray light , e.g. light that exited the sample at lower @xmath11 and ideally should not reach the detector fiber .",
    "analysis of the obtained photon tof histograms are made by employing standard diffusion models generalized for anisotropic diffusion @xcite , and using the extrapolated boundary conditions as described by contini et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the inadequacy of homogenous isotropic diffusion models is elucidated in fig .",
    "[ fig : isotropic_model ] .",
    "there , measurements at different source and detector separation are evaluated individually using the isotropic diffusion model .",
    "if diffusion is isotropic , fitted diffusion constants should be constant ( independent of @xmath11 ) .",
    "data from the reference materials are thus in excellent agreement with isotropic diffusion , and shows the capability of our system to deliver consistent data over a wide range of optical properties and source detector separations . at the same time",
    ", it is evident that the light transport in the compacted granular samples can not be explained by homogenous isotropic diffusion .",
    "note that also for the calcium phosphate data , although not easily seen in the figure , fitted diffusion constants are non - constant and systematically increasing with @xmath11 ( growing from 0.29 at @xmath9 to 0.33 mm@xmath13/ns at @xmath14 ) .",
    "one possible cause of the mismatch with the model of homogenous isotropic diffusion could , of course , be that our samples exhibit a spatially varying diffusion constant due to macroscopic density heterogeneity .",
    "however , careful investigation of sample homogeneity rules out this possibility .",
    "first , we investigated the radial sample homogeneity optically by making ptofs measurements with @xmath9 at different positions of the samples ( @xmath15 from 0 to 5 mm in steps of 0.5 mm , cf .",
    "[ fig : setup]b ) .",
    "for the compacted granular samples , coefficients of variation in fitted @xmath16 was smaller than 3% ( similar variation was seen also for the isotropic reference materials ) , and dependence on radial position was insignificant .",
    "this shows that our compacted samples are radially homogenous . to verify longitudinal homogeneity , our structures were also investigated by x - ray microtomography ( @xmath17ct ) . since radial homogeneity",
    "is confirmed by our optical experiments , @xmath17ct scans were optimized for longitudinal density mapping .",
    "still , there were no signs of longitudinal heterogeneity .",
    "series ) goes from being clear evidence of model inadequacy to becoming virtually perfect .",
    "the displayed data is from the mcc c50 sample but is representative for all samples . for visual clarity , only a subset of the involved spatial recordings are shown ( @xmath18 mm ) . ]",
    "convincing evidence that anisotropy is the proper explanation of why homogenous isotropic diffusion modeling fails is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : simultaneous_fits ] . there",
    ", simultaneous evaluation of the tof histograms of a @xmath11 series clearly shows that isotropic homogenous diffusion is far from being capable of explaining experimental data , while the anisotropic diffusion model , with its two diffusion constants , results in excellent fits .",
    "[ fig : simultaneous_fits ] gives only one example , but similar results were observed for all compressed granular samples . even for the calcium phosphate samples , which looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : isotropic_model ] may appear close to isotropic , a dramatic reduction of residuals are obtained when moving to anisotropic diffusion modeling . in comparison , and as expected , anisotropic modeling of data acquired from the isotropic reference materials result in insignificant improvement of fits .",
    "and @xmath19 ) as more and more spatial information is included ( i.e. , evaluation involving all datasets up to an upper @xmath11 ) . in order to reach good estimates of both longitudinal and radial diffusion constants",
    ", evaluation must clearly include measurements made at @xmath11 being on the order of the sample thickness . here , datapoints from three measurement repetitions from the mcc a ( 20kn ) sample are shown . ]",
    "it is important to realize that estimation of @xmath20 requires measurements at @xmath21 , while @xmath19 can be estimated using only a single measurement at @xmath9 .",
    "this can be inferred directly from anisotropic diffusion theory ( cf .",
    "[ eq : i_tr ] ) , and the issue is elaborated further in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial_info ] by showing how estimates of diffusion constants evolve as the amount of spatial information increase .",
    "while estimation of @xmath19 is very robust , proper evaluation of @xmath20 requires inclusion of measurements made at @xmath11-values comparable to sample thickness . on the other hand , @xmath20 converge to a constant value rather quickly .",
    "this means that inclusion of very large @xmath11-values is not necessary in general , making it possible to avoid low transmission measurements where stray light may distort data .",
    "measurements made very close to the radial boundary may also be influenced by edge effects in material density , and eventually also by the breakdown of the infinite slab diffusion - model .",
    "in fact , seen in fig . [",
    "fig : spatial_info ] , we generally observe a minor change in @xmath20 when including measurements at high @xmath11 ( when @xmath10 mm , the outer part of the fiber core is only 1.2 mm away from the sample boundary ) . in the following , our evaluation of anisotropy is therefore based on simultaneous evaluation of tof histograms recorded at @xmath11 not larger than 4 mm ( as mentioned earlier , the strongly scattering calcium phosphate samples are exceptions , and evaluation is limited to @xmath11 not larger than 3 mm ) .    , versus compression force for all samples .",
    "the general trend is that both anisotropy and diffusion constants increase with pressure ( the increase in @xmath16 corresponds to a decrease of the scattering strength ) .",
    "mcc samples are shown as solid circles ( @xmath22 ) , plus signs ( + ) and open circles ( @xmath23 ) , for the granule size classes a , b and c respectively .",
    "lactose samples are given by triangles ( @xmath24 ) , and calcium phosphate samples by the times symbol ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "note that three measurement repetitions were done on samples made at the lowest and highest compression force , as well as for the intermediate 20 kn mcc samples . ]",
    "[ fig : summary ] presents observed anisotropy and longitudinal diffusion constants for all the materials .",
    "measurement repetitions ( also shown ) show that the variation in derived @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath26 generally is very small .",
    "the coefficients of variation were between 0.3 and 3.3% , except for the 50 kn calcium phosphate which gave a 6.6% percent variation in @xmath20 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "the anisotropy of the mcc and lactose samples increase with pressure .",
    "interestingly , this trend is not shared by the calcium phosphate samples . in this context , it is important to note also differences in scattering properties .",
    "it is clear that the scattering strength is largely the same for the calcium phosphates .",
    "in contrast , scattering decrease with pressure for lactose and mcc samples ( note , however , the plateau reached at  30 kn for mcc samples , after which scattering remains constant ) .",
    "the fact that light propagation in compacted granular media can be strongly anisotropic represents a major revision of our understanding of the optics of such systems .",
    "it is therefore important to realize that our findings correlate well with recent reports on anisotropic pore structure .",
    "for example , pore space anisotropy of mcc compacts have been confirmed and shown to increase with compression force @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pore space anisotropy reported in these studies occur on length scales that should influence light scattering .",
    "the fact that radial diffusion is faster than longitudinal is presumably related to formation of crack - like pores running perpendicular to the compression axis @xcite . on the other hand , it should be noted that nmr porosimetry has been applied to e.g. lactose and calcium phosphate samples without clear signs of anisotropy .",
    "however , the major difference in the way the the the pore space is probed ( and differences in samples ) makes deeper comparison meaningless .",
    "we note , instead , that anisotropy of _ mechanical _ properties have been observed for compacts based on all material investigated here @xcite , rendering our observations highly plausible .",
    "in fact , since light scattering and its wavelength dependence is extremely sensitive to microstructure , we believe that spectroscopic optical methods may turn out to be very useful and sensitive probes of pore space anisotropy .",
    "conventional porosimetry methods like mercury intrusion and gas adsorption does not give information of pore directionality , and currently employed methods that do are subject to important limitations @xcite .",
    "besides opening a promising new route for characterization of material anisotropy , our results also have obvious implications for quantitative spectroscopy of compacts in general",
    ". the use of isotropic diffusion models must be reconsidered . moreover , considering a combination of anisotropic effects with the density variations characteristic of more complex shapes of e.g. pharmaceutical tablets @xcite , it is clear that model - based quantitative spectroscopy of powder compacts indeed is challenging .",
    "the picture gets even more complicated when considering also the more fundamental issue of how light sample complex porous structures @xcite .",
    "to conclude , our observation of strong anisotropic diffusion of light in compacted granular media have broad implications .",
    "as discussed above , the phenomenon can be used for material characterization and fundamental investigations of compression physics , and also has important implications for quantitative spectroscopy of compacts . at the same time , reaching full understanding of the relation between compression , microstructure and light scattering is challenging , and this endeavor will require extensive and interdisciplinary efforts in the future .",
    "the compacted granular samples are based on either microcrystalline cellulose ( mcc ) , lactose or calcium phosphate .",
    "all compacts were manufactured using a standard single - punch tablet press with a cylindrical die ( all having a 13 mm diameter and a total weight of 500 mg ) .",
    "the mcc - based samples represent realistic pharmaceutical tablets , containing 38.1% mcc ( excipient ) , 31.8% metoprolol ( active ingredient ) , 12.7% sodium starch glycolate ( disintegrant ) , 11.1% lactose ( filler ) , 2.9% colloidal silica , 2.2% povidone ( binder ) 1.2% magnesium stearate ( lubricant , reduces friction during compaction ) . in order to investigate influence of granule sizes ,",
    "mcc compacts were manufactured from sieved granules ( granule sizes : ( a ) @xmath27 m , ( b ) @xmath28 m , and ( c ) @xmath29 m , respectively ) .",
    "compression forces investigated are 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 40 and 50 kn , yielding sample thicknesses from 3.5 mm down to 2.7 mm .",
    "the samples are similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , for which mercury intrusion porosimetry showed than predominate pore size is around 1 - 5 @xmath1 m .",
    "lactose and calcium phosphate samples , on the other hand , were manufactured from pure powders with a 5 - 10 @xmath17 m mean particle size .",
    "compression forces were 30 , 40 and 55 kn for lactose ( thickness range 2.7 - 2.6 mm ) , and 20 , 30 , 40 and 50 kn for calcium phosphate ( thickness range 2.1 - 1.9 mm ) .      in a system with cylindrical symmetry , the time evolution of the intensity transmitted through a slab at a radial distance @xmath11 from the incident light pulse , @xmath30 , is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : i_tr ] @xcite .",
    "there @xmath31 is the incident intensity , @xmath32 the speed of light in the medium , @xmath33 the absorption coefficient , and @xmath20 and @xmath19 the radial and longitudinal diffusion constants respectively . the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 contain the dependence on slab thickness @xmath36 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . apart from @xmath39 , which gives the position of the isotropic light source that models injected light , they correspond to positions of negative and positive virtual sources introduced to handle boundary effects @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 is the position of the , so called , extrapolated boundary .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that both @xmath41 and @xmath40 depend on the diffusion constant @xmath19 .",
    "the source is located one transport mean free path into the medium , i.e. @xmath42 , and @xmath40 depends on the effective refractive index ( @xmath43 ) in a more complex manner .",
    "in fact , @xmath43 is not known exactly for our complex porous systems , but as long as sample dimension significantly exceed the transport mean free path of light , the time evolution of the transmitted intensity depends only weakly on @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "we use the approximate value @xmath44 throughout this work , resulting in a @xmath40 of @xmath45 . note that this value of @xmath40 is calculated using ordinary isotropic considerations @xcite , and is only a convenient approximation for anisotropic media .",
    "we have verified that a change in the assumed value of @xmath43 has negligible influence of results presented .",
    "it should also be noted that the size of the fiber cores ( @xmath6 m ) , i.e. the fact that @xmath11 is not really a single value for a single measurement , are taken into account by integration over source and detector areas .",
    "finally , note that the isotropic model of dynamic light diffusion through a slab is reached simply by setting @xmath46 , where @xmath16 then is the isotropic diffusion constant of the medium .",
    "fitting of eq .",
    "[ eq : i_tr ] to experimental data is made using only diffusion constant(s ) , absorption coefficient and amplitude coefficients as free fit parameters ( since @xmath41 and @xmath40 depend on @xmath19 , they are varied accordingly ) .",
    "when multiple tof histograms are evaluated simultaneously ( modeling of @xmath11 series as one compound dataset ) , each single dataset has its own free amplitude coefficient . measuring diffuse intensity in an absolute manner is extremely difficult , and attempts to maintain relative intensity relation for different @xmath11 would be highly inefficient due to the enormous difference in transmission .",
    "the absolute time scale ( @xmath47 ) is inferred from careful measurements of the instrumental response function ( irf ) , and the shape of the irf is taken into account during fitting by measuring the fit in terms of agreement between experimental data and the convolution between irf and diffusion model @xcite .",
