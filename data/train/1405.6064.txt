    "the discovery of detailed and integral fluctuation theorems is arguably one of the most significant recent advances in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the best known examples are the jarzynski equality @xcite ( integral fluctuation theorem ) and the crooks relation  @xcite ( detailed fluctuation theorem ) .",
    "the crooks relation implies the consideration of the time - reversed dynamics .",
    "as was already pointed out by crooks himself  @xcite , the application of the theorem involves a stringent condition on the initial condition of the reverse process , namely , that it be such that the final distribution of this reverse process is the initial distribution of the forward process ; see also @xcite . in that sense ,",
    "the integral fluctuation theorems appear to have a broader range of validity , a point made particularly clear in the work by speck and seifert @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation theorems derive from time - symmetry properties of the underlying microscopic dynamics .",
    "it was however realized that one can , at least in the context of markovian processes , consider two types of symmetry operations related to time - irreversible behavior . besides the time inversion of the driving",
    ", one can perform the time inversion of the dynamics associated to nonequilibrium boundary conditions .",
    "this is technically done by considering the adjoint of the markov operator .",
    "it was thus found by esposito and van den broeck @xcite that there are three different types of integral and detailed fluctuation theorems .",
    "each of these fluctuation theorems is associated to one of the three combinations of the two symmetry operations , corresponding to the total entropy production , the non - adiabatic entropy production ( loosely speaking associated to relaxation processes ) , or the adiabatic entropy production ( loosely speaking related to the dissipation of the nonequilibrium steady states ) .",
    "this discovery clarified the status of the speck - seifert and hatano - sasa @xcite fluctuation theorems and of the @xmath0 theorem familiar from the theory of stochastic processes @xcite . in the adiabatic fluctuation theorem ,",
    "the same initial condition is considered for both the original and transformed processes . for the total and non - adiabatic fluctuation theorem",
    "the transformed process starts with the final distribution reached in the forward process .",
    "the question can be raised whether the final distribution of this transformed process reproduces the initial distribution of the forward process , as this has a direct consequence on the interpretation of the fluctuation theorems .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that there is indeed a , generically unique , initial distribution for which this property holds .",
    "we call such an initial distribution an  echo state .",
    "\" as we will see , the echo state depends in an intricate manner on the details of the dynamics and is , in general , different for the total and non - adiabatic entropy productions .",
    "the identification of the echo states is of particular interest in the case of time - periodic driving , which we discuss in more detail . in the experiments considered so far",
    ", the measurements were restricted to the case in which the steady state was , for symmetry reasons , trivially identical to the echo state @xcite .",
    "this need not be the case .",
    "we will show how to identify the echo states in a general setting , and how to extract the proper statistics even when not operating with an echo state as the initial condition , by an appropriate  shadowing operation . \"",
    "finally , we illustrate how our prescriptions can be implemented with the analytic and numerical discussion of a modulated two - state quantum dot .",
    "we consider systems with markovian dynamics and a discrete space of states .",
    "the transition rates from a state @xmath1 to a state @xmath2 are denoted by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a time - dependent control variable that describes the external driving and @xmath5 specifies the mechanism that causes the transition .",
    "transitions are caused by contact with equilibrium reservoirs .",
    "the total transition rate from @xmath1 to @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the probability to be in state @xmath2 at time @xmath7 obeys the following master equation : @xmath8 or @xmath9 in vector notation .",
    "the initial condition is given by the probability distribution @xmath10 .",
    "the diagonal elements of the rate matrix satisfy @xmath11 . in the absence of driving ( @xmath12 )",
    ", a system in contact with a single reservoir @xmath5 will relax to the equilibrium distribution @xmath13 .",

    "the time of the @xmath16th jump is denoted by @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , with @xmath19 the number of jumps .",
    "the trajectory starts at @xmath20 and ends at @xmath21 .",
    "a trajectory is completely specified by its jump times @xmath17 , state prior to the jump @xmath22 , state after the jump @xmath23 , and reservoir that causes the jump @xmath24 . the probability to observe a trajectory",
    "@xmath25 , given @xmath10 , is equal to @xmath26.\\label{eq::probpathfwd}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in order to define the total trajectory entropy production ( ep ) we need to introduce the time - reversed trajectory @xmath27 \\}$ ] . also , with the ( forward ) driving @xmath4 we can associate the time - reversed driving @xmath28 . for later reference ,",
    "we introduce the following ( stochastic ) matrices : @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the time - ordered exponential .",
    "these matrices describe the time evolution from @xmath31 to @xmath32 of , respectively , the forward and reverse dynamics .    the probability to be in state @xmath2 at time @xmath7 under the reverse dynamics",
    "is written as @xmath33 , or in vector notation @xmath34 .",
    "the probability for a trajectory @xmath35 during the reverse dynamics and starting from @xmath36 is @xmath37.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the total trajectory ep is then defined as ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39 where the first term is the change in system entropy and the second term is the change in reservoir entropy .",
    "it is important to note that the end probability of the forward dynamics @xmath40 is taken as the start probability of the time - reversed dynamics , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "as outlined in @xcite , the total ep can be separated into adiabatic and non - adiabatic components .",
    "the adiabatic trajectory ep is defined as @xmath42 where we used detailed balance : @xmath43 the non - adiabatic trajectory ep reads @xmath44 the definitions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are equivalent to @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes that the system undergoes the adjoint dynamics with rates @xmath49 the adjoint dynamics @xmath50 has the same ness @xmath51 as the original dynamics @xmath52 .",
    "the dynamics @xmath53 starts with probability distribution @xmath10 , while the dynamics @xmath54 starts with @xmath55.the adiabatic ep is a measure of the difference between the instantaneous steady state @xmath56 and the equilibrium distributions @xmath57 of the reservoirs that cause the transitions .",
    "it is zero if the system is in contact with a single reservoir .",
    "physically , it can be understood as the part of the total ep associated with nonequilibrium boundary conditions , i.e. , coupling with different equilibrium reservoirs .",
    "the non - adiabatic ep is zero if the system undergoes no external driving @xmath58 , and if it starts in the steady state @xmath59 .",
    "it is therefore seen as the part of the total ep associated with time - dependent driving and relaxation to the steady state .",
    "having defined the different eps on the trajectory level , we now move on to the detailed fluctuation theorems which deal with probability distributions of the entropy production .",
    "we start by calculating the probability to observe a total ep @xmath60 in the forward dynamics , given the initial distribution @xmath10 . using the definition eq .",
    "one finds : @xmath61 with @xmath62 the dirac @xmath63 function .",
    "the sum appearing on the right - hand side of eq .   is a normalized function with respect to the variable @xmath60 , so it is tempting to regard it as the probability to observe a total ep @xmath64 during the reverse dynamics .",
    "this is , however , not correct ; the distribution for the total ep during the reverse dynamics , in analogy with eq .",
    ", is @xmath65 where we have used that @xmath66 , since @xmath67 by definition .",
    "the initial distributions appearing inside the @xmath63 function are related via @xmath68 .",
    "it is clear that such a relation is not satisfied in general for eq .  , but only when @xmath69 .",
    "hence only for initial conditions @xmath10 satisfying the condition @xmath70 the requirement is that the end probability of the time - reversed process is equal to the start probability of the forward process .",
    "initial conditions satisfying this requirement are called echo states , and are denoted by @xmath71 .",
    "we can then write the detailed fluctuation theorem ( dft ) for the total ep as follows : @xmath72 if one starts from an echo state the entropy production is odd under time reversal [ cf .",
    ": @xmath73 the requirement eq .   is equivalent to requiring that the ep is odd under time reversal for all paths @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , from eq .",
    "it is clear that the reservoir ep is always odd under time reversal : @xmath74 .",
    "the system ep is odd under time reversal only if @xmath75 for all @xmath2 , i.e. , if the initial condition is an echo state .",
    "echo states can be found by obtaining the eigenvector of @xmath76 with eigenvalue 1 .",
    "since @xmath76 is the product of two stochastic matrices , it is itself again a stochastic matrix .",
    "hence there is at least one such eigenvector @xmath71 .",
    "if the matrix is furthermore irreducible and aperiodic , which we consider to be the typical case , the perron - frobenius theorem dictates that there is exactly one eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath77 .",
    "we next turn to the dfts for the adiabatic and non - adiabatic ep @xcite . for the adiabatic ep we have @xmath78 where we have used that @xmath79 .",
    "hence we can write @xmath80 for _ any _ initial distribution @xmath10 .",
    "for the non - adiabatic ep we find @xmath81 and for the time - reversed adjoint process : @xmath82 where we use that @xmath83 , and where we have defined @xmath84.\\ ] ] initial conditions satisfying @xmath85 are again called echo states , and are denoted as @xmath86 .",
    "the dft for the non - adiabatic ep can be written as @xmath87 the derivation of this condition is completely analogous to the one for the total ep eq .  .",
    "for the echo states @xmath86 , the non - adiabatic ep is odd under the adjoint time - reversed dynamics : @xmath88 starting from the echo state @xmath86 ensures that the system entropy is odd under the adjoint time - reversed dynamics , while the other term of the non - adiabatic ep is always odd under the adjoint time - reversed dynamics ; see eq .  .",
    "equation is therefore equivalent to requiring that eq",
    ".   holds for all paths @xmath25 .",
    "consider a process @xmath4 between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the echo state for the total ep can be calculated from eq .  , with @xmath89 and @xmath90 given by eq .  .",
    "as such , @xmath71 depends in an intricate manner on the dynamics of both the forward and the reverse processes .",
    "it is therefore difficult to make general comments on its properties .",
    "for some relevant special cases , the echo state can however be determined by a simple calculation .",
    "an important class of processes which always start from the echo state for the total ep is nonequilibrium steady states @xcite . since @xmath58 one has that @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    ".   then reduces to @xmath93 \\mathbf{p}_0 $ ] , whose solution is @xmath94 . in this case",
    "the non - adiabatic ep is zero , so the adiabatic and total eps are equal .",
    "the echo state for the total ep can also be easily calculated for processes with periodic time - dependent rates that are symmetric under time reversal @xcite .",
    "consider a system subject to a periodic driving @xmath95 , with @xmath96 the period . in the long - time limit",
    "the system is in a time - dependent periodic steady state @xmath97 @xcite : @xmath98 consider the situation where @xmath99 , with a driving symmetric under time reversal : @xmath100 . in this case @xmath92 and @xmath101 is the echo state : @xmath102 the dft for the total ep has been verified experimentally for this situation @xcite .",
    "we stress that @xmath101 is , in general , not the echo state for the non - adiabatic ep .    in the limit",
    "@xmath103 the contribution of the initial condition to the eps can become negligible .",
    "more precisely , the conditions eqs .   and",
    "are violated because of the contribution of the system entropy in respectively eqs .   and .",
    "the reservoir ep typically grows with time .",
    "hence , when the system ep is bounded , its contribution becomes negligible in the limit @xmath103 . in this limit one recovers the asymptotic fluctuation for the total ep @xcite .",
    "if the state space is infinite , the asymptotic fluctuation theorem can be invalid @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention a particular scenario for the total ep described in @xcite which reproduces the echo state . a system in contact with several reservoirs",
    "is prepared so that its initial state is the equilibrium distribution of one particular reservoir at @xmath104 .",
    "when the forward process is finished , the system is allowed to relax to the same equilibrium distribution but now at @xmath105 .",
