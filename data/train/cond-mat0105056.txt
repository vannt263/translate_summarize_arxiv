    "comparisons between highly accurate computed and measured compton spectra @xcite indicate systematic discrepancies which are _ anisotropic _ and would be difficult to explain within the standard lam - platzman ( lp ) type correlation correction to the emd @xcite which is _ isotropic _ by construction .",
    "the emd in al , on the other hand , is adduced to be reasonably close to the lda predictions @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to gain a theoretical handle on this problem @xcite .",
    "the early optimism of a gw computation @xcite in li did not hold up to a later investigation @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) studies of si and li @xcite also do not reveal any substantial differences in the emd with respect to the lda predictions .",
    "it should be emphasized that a successful theory must not only explain what may be thought of as the `` low '' density case of monovalent li , but also it must approach the lda results correctly in the `` high '' density limit of trivalent al in addition to explain the behavior of divalent be .    in order to make progress ,",
    "we observe first that the current gw and qmc computations in connection with the emd assume that the fermionic correlation is not modified drastically by interactions and that an adiabtic path exists between the free and the interacting electron gas .",
    "the many body wavefunction underlying the gw and qmc work is built from slater determinants of single - particle orbitals , with an implicit nodal structure and plasmon - type physics of correlations @xcite which is more or less similar to that of the lda @xcite .",
    "bearing these considerations in mind , we have been motivated to examine other strategies , and here we propose a bcs - like approach for going beyond the framework of the dft @xcite , wherein we start with singlet electron pairs referred to as ` geminals ' @xcite , and then combine these objects into an antisymmetrized product ( agp ) to obtain the wavefunction of the many body system .",
    "such an idea has been invoked previously , for example , in connection with liquid he@xmath4 @xcite and in quantum chemistry calculations of molecules @xcite .",
    "an application to the problem of the emd in extended systems which is presented here has , to our knowledge , not been reported in the literature before .",
    "notably , the agp wavefunction in molecules typically yields only @xmath5 % of the available correlation energy @xcite .",
    "however , our main goal here is to develop a working scheme which can capture some of the essential physics of the emd of the correlated electron gas , and not so much to obtain the total energy accurately . in this spirit",
    ", it is hoped that the agp method can provide a useful tool for understanding the recent compton spectra and the nature of the emd over a wide range of electron densities .",
    "an outline of this article is as follows .",
    "we start in section ii with a rigorous expression for the emd , @xmath6 , in the correlated electron gas in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the one - particle density matrix @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "section iii discusses the conventional lam - platzman ( lp ) treatment @xcite of correlations within the lda which is based on the momentum density @xmath8 of the interacting heg @xcite , including a useful parametrization of the more recent qmc data for @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "section iv takes up a description of the agp wavefunction and the associated total energy functional @xcite .",
    "a relatively simple practical implementation of the agp scheme is discussed in section v. the theory is illustrated by considering aspects of the emd and compton profiles in li , be and al in section vi .",
    "we emphasize that although these results indicate that the present method is promising , further work is necessary for confronting the agp model quantitatively with experiments .",
    "finally , section vii summarizes the main results of this article .",
    "we start with the one - particle density matrix , @xmath9 , which is defined in terms of the normalized n - particle wavefunction , @xmath10 , as @xmath11 where the integral extends over the coordinates of all other particles .",
    "the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath12 define the _ natural orbitals _",
    ", @xmath13 , and the associated occupation numbers , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the density operator @xmath12 can then be expanded into projectors @xmath15 via the spectral theorem : @xmath16 if one requires the natural orbitals to possess the symmetry of the hamiltonian , then they constitute a unique decomposition in an orthonormal basis set .",
    "other basis sets for describing the many body wavefunction are often used , e.g. the _ generalized overlap amplitudes _",
    "@xcite which are linearly dependent .",
    "any basis set can of course be related to the natural orbitals through an appropriate canonical transformation .",
    "the emd is defined as the momentum transform of the density matrix , @xmath17 note that , in general , the emd involves off - diagonal elements of the real space density matrix . in terms of the natural orbitals @xmath13 , however , the emd can be cast in the simple form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the momentum transform of @xmath13 .",
    "if the many body wavefunction is represented by a single determinant , which is true in the case of hartree fock or the dft @xcite , then the density matrix is idempotent @xmath20 and reduces to a summation over the occupied spin - dependent orbitals @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 the emd in this _ independent particle model _ ( ipm ) is similar to the more general eq .",
    "( 2 ) , except that the occupation numbers are now strictly 0 or 1 depending upon whether the state in question is empty or filled .",
    "electron correlations , in effect , allow these occupied and empty ipm states to mix so that the occupation of states below the fermi energy ( @xmath23 ) becomes less than 1 , while that of states above @xmath23 becomes non - zero .",
    "one further point is noteworthy . in a periodic system ,",
    "the electronic states are the bloch states , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the band index and @xmath26 is the crystal momentum which is restricted to the first brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the associated occupation numbers , @xmath27 , possess translational symmetry , i.e. @xmath28 with respect to the set of reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath29 .",
    "as a consequence of the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite , the ground - state expectation value of any operator @xmath30 is a functional @xmath31 $ ] of the electron density @xmath32 .",
    "it can be shown that @xcite @xmath33=o_0[n(\\r ) ] +   \\frac{d}{d\\lambda } e_{xc}[n(\\r)](\\lambda)~ , \\label{eq : bauer}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 $ ] is the expectation value for a system of noninteracting fermions moving in the effective field involved in the kohn - sham formalism , @xmath35 is the exchange - correlation energy functional and @xmath36 is a scalar coupling parameter for the operator @xmath30 .",
    "the value obtained for the non - interacting case given by the first term on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bauer ] ) , must be corrected by the second term .",
    "this so - called lp correction@xcite provides a formal scheme for treating correlation effects in the interacting system within the dft .    insofar as the momentum density in extended systems is concerned , lda is perhaps the most common implementation of the dft .",
    "the relevant expression for the lp correction , @xmath37(p)$ ] , is based on the treatment of @xmath35 in the heg @xcite .",
    "@xmath38(p)=\\int_{\\mbox{ws}}~                 [ \\rho_h(r_s({\\bf r}),p)-\\rho_0(p ) ]                 ~n({\\bf r})~d^3{\\bf r}~. \\label{eqlp}\\ ] ] here , the integral extends over the wigner - seitz ( ws ) unit cell .",
    "the square brackets in the integrand give the difference between the momentum densities @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the interacting and non - interacting heg , respectively , evaluated at the local density @xmath32 of the physical system given by the electron density parameter @xmath41 .    despite the limitations of form ( [ eqlp ] ) a point to which we return below , this equation has been used extensively in the literature for evaluating the lp correction by using a variety of different results for the heg starting with the work of daniel and vosko @xcite .",
    "the most recent qmc data for @xmath8 however would be the most satisfactory to employ @xcite .    with this motivation",
    ", we provide a convenient formula for @xmath42 as a function of @xmath43 , which we have obtained by parameterization of the qmc data @xcite .",

    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 has been chosen to satisfy the electron number sum rule .",
    "[ heg ] shows that the qmc results parametrized here over the typical metallic range of densities ( @xmath43 varying between 2 and 5 ) differ significantly from those given by the early work of lundqvist @xcite parametrized by cardwell and cooper @xcite ; the original qmc data points lie indistinguishably close to the fitted solid curve of fig . 1 and are not shown for simplicity .",
    "the lp expression of eq . ( [ eqlp ] ) suffers from a number of limitations .",
    "most importantly , this form only describes an _ isotropic _ redistribution of the emd , even though the effect of correlations will in general be _",
    "this also implies that the lp corrected emd will possess a spurious feature at the free electron fermi radius in all directions in the momentum space . finally , the movement of spectral weight from below to above @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eqlp ] ) is not very transparent in the sense that it is not associated directly with changes in the occupation numbers of various states , making it very difficult to impose reasonable physical conditions on the occupation numbers such as those of translational symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) .    bearing these considerations in mind , and the fact that the qmc and gw results based on the lda in li @xcite are not all that different from the lp correction and , therefore , would not explain the experimental emd in li , it is clear that there is need to go beyond the basic form of the slater - jastrow many - body wavefunction implicit in much of the qmc work given by @xmath57 where the jastrow factor @xmath58 accounts for the plasmon zero modes@xcite and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are slater determinants for up and down spin electrons . to make a headway , we propose using a bcs - like many body wavefunction in which individual elements involve _ singlet electron pairs _ , rather than one - particle orbitals .",
    "the underlying nodal structure of such a many body wavefunction tends to minimize the effects of the exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "as already noted , such an approach has been invoked in a variety of problems in the literature over the years @xcite , and here we are suggesting its use in connection with the treatment of momentum density in extended systems .",
    "the starting point is a singlet pair wavefunction or the associated _ generating geminal _",

    "for a two electron system , agp is exact and equivalent to a configuration interaction calculation .",
    "the @xmath13 s and @xmath62 s may be determined by minimizing the total energy functional . in extended systems",

    "notably , the agp satisfies the translational - symmetry requirement of eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss some of the salient features of the emd predicted by the relatively simple theoretical model of the preceding subsection .",
    "examples of li , be and al are considered as a means of getting a handle on correlation effects for a range of electron concentrations varying from one electron per atom in li to two in be and three in al . as emphasized already in the introduction ,",
    "our main purpose here is to establish that the present scheme is capable of explaining , at least in principle , some of the key experimental observations in li , be and al @xcite .    in connection with the compton spectra",
    ", it should be noted that the compton profile ( cp ) , @xmath108 , represents the double integral of the ground - state emd @xmath109 : @xmath110 where @xmath111 lies along the scattering vector of the x - rays .",
    "li is considered first .",
    "( [ eq : janak ] ) , we obtain @xmath112 ry , which when compared with the valence electron band width , @xmath113 ry , yields @xmath114 .",
    "this implies that the ipm values of occupation numbers will be modified substantially by correlations .",
    "2 compares a typical cp ( results along [ 100 ] are given ) in li for lda with and without the lp correction , and the agp model computation .",
    "the lda ( solid ) displays a cusp around 0.6 a.u . which reflects the break in the emd at @xmath2 .",
    "the addition of the lp correction ( light dashed ) shifts some spectral weight from low to high momenta , but the cusp at @xmath2 is essentially unchanged . in sharp contrast , in the agp curve ( thick dashed ) , the feature at @xmath2 is completely smoothed out and the emd is redistributed throughout the momentum space .",
    "the agp results are at least qualitatively similar to the behavior of the experimental cp s in li which show that the size of the discontinuity @xmath1 at @xmath2 is very small and that the measured cp is substantially lower than lda around @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "we should keep in mind nevertheless the fact that the agp results in fig .",
    "2 invoke a series of approximations which might oversmooth the discontinuity at @xmath2 .",
    "notably , spin - polarized electronic structure computations indicate the importance of spin - wave fluctuations in li@xcite , suggesting that some renormalization of the occupation numbers in li could also be produced by such a mechanism .",
    "interestingly , an extensive study of @xmath116 disordered alloys @xcite over the composition range @xmath117 indicates that the measured cp s come into better accord with the lda predictions with increasing mg concentration .",
    "this observation will find a natural explanation in our theoretical framework since we expect the width of the valence band to increase with increasing mg content with little change in the exchange integral @xmath96 , so that the parameter @xmath105 ( see , eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha ] ) will presumably decrease as will the correlation effect .    turning to be ,",
    "the exchange integral is computed to be , @xmath112 ry , but @xmath118 ry , giving @xmath119 .",
    "therefore the correlation effect on the emd in be is smaller than li , consistent with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "3 focuses on the difference , @xmath120 , between the agp and the lda ( including the lp correction ) predictions of cp s along two different crystal directions .",
    "the lp correction ( dashed ) is seen to mimick the overall shape of @xmath121 .",
    "however , in contrast to the lp correction which is _ isotropic _ , the residual correlation correction given by @xmath121 is _",
    "anisotropic_. along [ 100 ] , @xmath122 differs relatively little from the lp curve , but along [ 001 ] the excursions are much larger .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "3 are in qualitative accord with some of the characteristics of the experimental cp s in be . by comparing the residuals of our fig .",
    "3 with the experimental residuals ( defined as , @xmath123 , which are given in fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it will be seen that @xmath124 , like @xmath121 , deviates little from the lp curve along [ 100 ] ; in sharp contrast , along [ 001 ] @xmath124 contains a remarkable pattern of undulations rather similar to that seen in @xmath121 in fig .",
    "further study is needed to pin down the origin of specific structures in @xmath121 in terms , for example , of the fermi surface features .    finally ,",
    "in the case of al , we find @xmath125 ry , which as expected is small , reflecting the decrease of @xmath96 with increasing electron density . on the other hand ,",
    "the band width @xmath126 ry is quite large , so that @xmath127 is rather small .",
    "therefore , the emd in al will not suffer much redistribution beyond the lda via electron correlations .",
    "this again is consistent with experimental observations which show that the emd in al is described reasonably well by the conventional lda picture @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this point further by fig . 3 where the lda and agp momentum densities @xmath128 are compared along a typical direction ( note these are 3d momentum densities and not the cp s ) .",
    "the agp and lda are seen to be quite close overall , some rounding of the fermi break in agp notwithstanding .",
    "we discuss the theoretical treatment of the emd in the correlated electron gas with the purpose of developing an understanding of recent high resolution compton scattering experiments on a variety of materials .",
    "emd can be expressed rigorously in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the one - particle density matrix , which play the roles of effective orbitals @xmath13 s  the ` natural orbitals ' , and the associated occupation numbers @xmath14 s , respectively .",
    "much of the existing emd work in crystals is based on the use of bloch wavefunctions computed within the lda and the related ipm values of occupation numbers ( i.e. , 1 for filled and 0 for empty states ) . in the dft , the expectation value of any operator ( excepting the electron density @xmath129 ) must be corrected with respect to its ipm value in order to include the effect of correlations in the interacting system .",
    "the standard calculation of such an lp correction to the ipm momentum density involves the momentum density @xmath8 in the interacting heg .",
    "although many attempts to evaluate @xmath39 in the heg have been made , the recent qmc results are perhaps the most accurate . in this connection",
    ", we provide a convenient parametrization of the qmc data for @xmath39 as a function of the electron density parameter @xmath43 ; this form of @xmath39 should be used for computing the lp correction . note that the lda - based lp correction possesses fundamental limitations , e.g.",
    ", it can only describe an isotropic redistribution of the emd .    in order to go beyond the framework of the dft",

    "although such an approach has been invoked previously in a variety of problems , we are not aware of its application to treat the emd in extended systems",
    ". the agp wavefunction tends to minimize the effects of the exclusion principle and possesses a fundamentally different nodal structure compared to the slater - jastrow type many body wavefunctions based on single - particle orbitals which are implicit in the lda and qmc work .",
    "we begin to explore the nature of the emd in the agp scheme in this article by approximating the natural orbitals by the kohn - sham orbitals . by making the assumption that the energy gained through the bcs - like term",
    "will be roughly compensated by the exchange - correlation part of the hartree - fock term in the total energy functional , we show that the bcs energy scale , @xmath130 , where @xmath96 is a readily computed exchange - type integral . the key parameter which controls",
    "the redistribution of states in our theory then is , @xmath131 , with @xmath102 being the valence electron band - width .",
    "finally , we consider the application of the agp method to discuss the emd and compton spectra of li , be and al as illustrative examples . in li , we find @xmath132 , implying a substantial renormalization of the lda states , in essential accord with experimental results which indicate the break in the emd to be renormalized to a nearly zero value . in be , @xmath133 , and",

    "<S> recent high resolution compton scattering experiments clearly reveal that there are fundamental limitations to the conventional local density approximation ( lda ) based description of the ground state electron momentum density ( emd ) in solids . in order to go beyond the framework of the density functional theory ( dft ) </S>",
    "<S> , we consider for the correlated system a bcs - like approach in which we start with a singlet pair wavefunction or a geminal from which the many body wavefunction is then constructed by taking an antisymmetrized geminal product ( agp ) . </S>",
    "<S> a relatively simple practical implementation of the agp method is developed where the one - particle orbitals are approximated by the kohn - sham solutions used in standard band computations , and the orbital - dependent bcs energy scale @xmath0 is determined through a readily computed exchange - type integral . </S>",
    "<S> the methodology is illustrated by considering emd and compton profiles in li , be and al . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in li the present scheme predicts a substantial renormalization of the lda result for the emd ; in be , the computed correlation effect is _ anisotropic _ , while in al , the deviations from the lda are relatively small . </S>",
    "<S> these theoretical predictions are in qualitative accord with the corresponding experimental observations on li , be and al , and indicate the potential of the agp method for describing correlation effects on the emd in wide classes of materials .    </S>",
