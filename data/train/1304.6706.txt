    "the deterministic motion of spherical particles through geometric constrictions is at the core of a number of microfluidic unit operations and devices .",
    "some prominent examples include separation systems , e.g. , based on pinched flow fractionation,@xcite particle focusing methods,@xcite such as geometrical focusing,@xcite and constricted microchannels and micromodels of porous media used to study particle deposition and clogging.@xcite in all cases , the interactions of the suspended particles with the confining walls of a microfluidic channel play a crucial role in determining their motion and fate .",
    "the nature of the interactions can be hydrodynamic , particularly important when particle size is comparable to the confinement , or non - hydrodynamic , such as solid - solid contact due to surface roughness .",
    "the motion of suspended particles in microfluidic systems is in many cases described based on the fluid flow streamlines obtained in the absence of particles .",
    "rigorously , such an explanation is valid only for point particles , because it neglects the effect of particle size and particle - wall hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "moreover , the streamlines are calculated in the stokes regime , neglecting fluid inertia .",
    "particle inertia is also ignored and the effect of non - hydrodynamic interactions , such as solid - solid contact , is typically incorporated indirectly .",
    "for example , jain and posner model the effect of roughness on particle dispersion in order to estimate the relevant statistical properties of the separation process , such as its resolution.@xcite however , there is ample evidence that hydrodynamic interactions , inertia effects , and non - hydrodynamic repulsive forces significantly affect the individual particle trajectories through narrow constrictions.@xcite    consider the case of pinched flow fractionation ( pff ) , in which the separative lateral displacement experienced by particles of unequal size is achieved by passing the suspension through a constriction , followed by a sudden expansion.@xcite although the original explanation offered for the separative lateral displacement was based on particle motion superimposed on the streamlines in stokes flow,@xcite particle size and hydrodynamic interactions can not be ignored in pff due to the small particle - wall separations that take place near the constriction.@xcite it has been also shown recently , that inertia effects ( manifesting themselves as ` lift ' forces ) might play a crucial role in pff.@xcite in some particle focusing methods inertial effects are also present , and even exploited as a suspension of particles moves through a series of constrictions.@xcite in fact , the asymmetric trajectories observed in focusing devices in which the constriction geometry is fore - aft symmetric@xcite indicates the presence of _ irreversible _ forces , i.e. , inertial forces or non - hydrodynamic interactions between the particles and the channel wall .",
    "otherwise , the trajectories should be symmetric and reversible , consistent with stokes equations .",
    "in the case of clogging in microchannels , it has been argued that particle deposition involves the interplay between hydrodynamic as well as non - hydrodynamic interactions.@xcite the hydrodynamic interaction of particles with constrictions / channel walls leads to particle trajectories that deviate from flow streamlines , and if a particle reaches a critical separation from the wall , non - hydrodynamic attractive interactions result in particle deposition.@xcite    in this work , we investigate the motion of a spherical particle passing through a constriction created by a spherical obstacle of the same size and a plane wall ( see figure [ fig : systemgeometry ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the minimum surface - to - surface separation between the particle and the obstacle occuring during the motion , since it is the relevant length scale to assess the relative importance of short - range non - hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "specifically , we show that the minimum separation decreases as the magnitude of inertia increases and/or the aperture of the constriction decreases .",
    "the inferences drawn from these results are consistent with the observations reported in previous experiments , in that , the lateral displacement of a given size of particles increases as the aperture of the constriction becomes smaller.@xcite in addition , the computational nature of this work enables us to isolate the effects of fluid and particle inertia by adjusting both the particle - to - fluid density ratio as well as the force acting on the particle . in comparison ,",
    "the ratio of the densities was moderate in the experiments reported in @xcite ( @xmath0 ) , and hence the effects of particle and fluid inertia were coupled .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the following section , we define the geometry of the system under investigation and describe the parameter space relevant to the problem in terms of dimensionless numbers . in  [ sec : onlywall ] , we introduce a hard - core model for non - hydrodynamic repulsive interactions , and discuss its effect on particle trajectories in the absence ( [ subsec : hardwallmodel ] ) and presence ( [ subsec : hardwallmodelinertia ] ) of inertia . in  [ sec : bothinertiandwall ] , we present the results of our simulations in the presence of a pinching wall only ( [ subsec : applmodelonlywall ] ) , in the presence of inertia only ( [ subsec : applmodelonlyinertia ] ) , and in the presence of both a pinching wall as well as significant inertia ( [ subsec : applmodelboth ] ) . finally in ",

    "in general , the trajectories followed by the particles for different initial offsets @xmath10 , and thus the minimum dimensionless separations @xmath12 , are functions of the three dimensionless numbers : @xmath44 .",
    "we estimate the effect of short - range non - hydrodynamic interactions on a particle trajectory by comparing the range of the interactions with the corresponding minimum separation attained by the particle along that trajectory .",
    "further , the particle trajectories in the stokes regime are symmetric about the @xmath9-axis in the absence of non - hydrodynamic interactions",
    ". therefore , the symmetry ( or equivalently , asymmetry ) exhibited by a particle trajectory also serves a diagnostic purpose : any asymmetry present in the trajectories obtained in our simulations is indicative of deviations from the stokes regime ( i.e. , significant inertia)@xcite .",
    "the presence of such asymmetry can be determined by comparing the initial and final offsets .",
    "thus , in the next sections , we use the minimum separation ( @xmath12 ) as well as the offsets ( @xmath10 and @xmath1 ) as representative variables to investigate the effect of non - hydrodynamic interactions , inertia and pinching on the particle trajectories . throughout this article , for brevity and clarity , we present results corresponding to @xmath45 . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appa ] , we present the minimum separation @xmath12 for the entire range of @xmath10 considered ( @xmath46@xmath47 ) .",
    "we have shown in previous work that the minimum separation @xmath12 decreases dramatically with the initial offset @xmath10 , especially when @xmath10 becomes comparable to the obstacle radius ( or , the mean of particle and obstacle radii for unequal sizes).@xcite an initial offset of @xmath48 , for example , results in a minimum separation @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , for a particle with its radius in the millimeter range , the corresponding minimum separation amounts to a few microns , while for micrometer - sized particles , the predicted minimum separations are at atomic length - scales . in reality ,",
    "micrometer - sized particles exhibit various non - hydrodynamic interactions at separations @xmath50 nm@xmath51 , of which we are concerned with those of a repulsive nature in the context of this work , such as , electrostatic double layer repulsion,@xcite solid - solid contact due to surface roughness@xcite and steric repulsion.@xcite following previous studies , we use a simple model that describes these interactions with a hard - core repulsive potential.@xcite in this approximation , if the dimensionless range of the repulsive interaction is @xmath52 , any surface - to - surface separation @xmath53 is not possible , since it is inside the core of the interaction .",
    "consequently , if a particle trajectory reaches a minimum separation @xmath12 in the absence of non - hydrodynamic interactions , by comparing it with @xmath52 we investigate the effect of these interactions .",
    "moreover , we assume that the hard - core repulsion is the only effect of the potential , in that , the hydrodynamic mobility of the suspended particle is not affected.@xcite        in the absence of inertia , there is a one - to - one relationship between the minimum separation and the initial offset .",
    "@xcite we can thus define a _ critical _ offset @xmath54 ,",
    "as the final offset resulting from a minimum separation equal to the range of the repulsive interaction i.e. , @xmath55 ( see figure [ fig : threetypesofcollisions ] ) . in previous work",
    ", we have established that the critical offset @xmath54 completely characterizes the asymmetry in the particle trajectory caused by the repulsive interaction.@xcite any trajectory beginning with an initial offset smaller than the critical value ( @xmath56 ) would result in a minimum separation smaller than the range of the repulsive interaction .",
    "since such separations are unattainable in the presence of the interaction , once the particle attains @xmath52 , the separation remains constant and equal to @xmath52 on the approaching side and , as shown in figure [ fig : threetypesofcollisions ] , the outgoing half of the trajectory collapses onto the trajectory with @xmath57 . on the other hand , for @xmath58 ,",
    "the trajectories , unaffected by non - hydrodynamic interactions , are symmetric in the absence of inertia .",
    "the single - valued function relating @xmath12 and @xmath10 ( or @xmath1 ) is the same as that relating @xmath52 and @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite therefore , we can predict the dependence of @xmath54 on the pinching gap for a given @xmath52 by computing @xmath12 as a function of @xmath10 for different @xmath22 ratios .",
    "_ in conclusion , the critical offset is a macroscopic and experimentally measurable variable , which serves as a probe / proxy for the range of the repulsive interaction , a microscopic effective variable that is experimentally less accessible._@xcite      the fore - aft symmetry of the trajectories is broken in the presence of inertia ( see figure [ fig : threetypesofcollisionsinertia ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the presence of non - hydrodynamic interactions , we need to define two distinct critical offsets : the critical initial - offset @xmath59 and the critical final - offset @xmath60 , as shown in figure [ fig : threetypesofcollisionsinertia ] .    ) , the trajectories are asymmetric even in the absence of non - hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "such asymmetry leads to two critical offsets , viz.- @xmath61 as shown . ]",
    "the critical initial - offset @xmath59 is defined in the same manner as in case of negligible inertia .",
    "the definition of the critical final - offset ( @xmath60 ) needs the auxilliary assumption that inertia is negligible when the particle approaches small surface - to - surface separations from the obstacle . under this assumption ,",
    "the final offset would also present a critical behavior such that , all trajectories with @xmath62 would collapse onto a single trajectory downstream to the obstacle , which in turn defines the critical final - offset @xmath60 corresponding to @xmath59 .",
    ", exhibiting the effect of pinching in the stokes regime ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "the vertical dashed lines at @xmath65 represent the initial and final @xmath6-coordinates of the particle , respectively . ]    in figure [ fig : sampletrajectorieswall ] , we show representative trajectories corresponding to different apertures of the pinching gap , for the same initial offset @xmath45 and with negligible fluid and particle inertia .",
    "as expected , the trajectories remain fore - aft symmetric in all cases . when the aperture of the pinching gap is reduced , we observe that the particle follows trajectories that get significantly closer to the obstacle .    in light of the hard - core model",
    "discussed before , let us now consider the effect of the non - hydrodynamic interactions on the trajectories through a pinching gap in the stokes regime .",
    "consider trajectories with the initial offset @xmath66 ( see figure [ fig : sampletrajectorieswall ] ) , and non - hydrodynamic interactions with a dimensionless range @xmath67 .",
    "let the critical offset corresponding to @xmath68 in the absence of pinching be @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , in the absence of pinching the particle trajectories under consideration attain a minimum separation @xmath70 , and the non - hydrodynamic interactions have no effect on them ( e.g. , the top - most trajectory in figure [ fig : threetypesofcollisions ] ) .",
    "as the aperture of the pinching gap is reduced , while keeping the initial offset constant at @xmath71 , figure [ fig : sampletrajectorieswall ] shows that the particle comes closer to the obstacle . eventually , at a particular aperture",
    ", we get @xmath72 , which implies that the critical offset has increased from @xmath73 to @xmath71 . in other words ,",

    "figure [ fig : sampletrajectoriesinertia ] shows representative trajectories ( with @xmath66 ) in the presence of inertia effects , but in the absence of a pinching wall .",
    "we observe that the effect of inertia is similar to that of pinching discussed earlier , such that the particle gets closer to the obstacle as the magnitude of ( fluid and/or particle ) inertia increases .",
    "although the effects of pinching and inertia on the minimum separation are similar , in the presence of inertia the minimum separation is no longer attained at the symmetry plane ( @xmath75 ) but upstream to the obstacle - center ( at negative @xmath6-values , see figure [ fig : ximinvsxbothrest ] ) .",
    "we also observe that the @xmath6-coordinate at which the minimum separation is attained decreases with increasing inertia ( similar plots showing the individual effects of fluid and particle inertia can be found in appendix [ sec : appa ] ) .      ) on the minimum surface - to - surface separation between the particle and the obstacle , for different magnitudes of inertia and a fixed initial offset , @xmath45 . ]    in figure [ fig : ximindoverdbin2allinertia ] , we consolidate our results and present the minimum separation @xmath12 for all the cases of pinching and inertia considered in this work , at @xmath66 . as discussed so far , we observe that reducing the aperture of the pinching gap causes the particle to attain a smaller minimum surface - to - surface separation in all the cases shown , with or without particle and/or fluid inertia .",
    "further , the figure also shows that for any fixed aperture of the pinching gap the minimum separation attained by the particle decreases with increasing inertia .",
    "our simulations also indicate that the effect of particle inertia on @xmath12 is attenuated in the presence of the pinching wall",
    ". the attenuation could be due to the hydrodynamic resistance offered by the pinching wall , which reduces the particle velocity , thereby diminishing the effective magnitude of particle inertia ( note that for calculating the stokes and reynolds numbers reported in this work , we have used the bulk settling velocity of spheres ) .",
    "the detailed plots of @xmath12 as a function of @xmath10 for different stokes and reynolds numbers are presented in figures [ fig : onlyinertianowall ] and [ fig : bothrestnowall ] , and the effect of pinching on these plots is shown in figures [ fig : bothinertiandwallat30][fig : bothinertiandwall ] , in appendix [ sec : appa ] .",

    "corresponding to @xmath77 , as a function of reynolds and stokes numbers , in the presence and the absence of a pinching wall . ]",
    "we are also interested in the effect of inertia in combination with pinching on the final offset @xmath1 , since changes in the final offset as a function of inertia could lead to separation based , for example , on density differences . in figure",
    "[ figbout : onlyinertianowall ] , we present the effects of particle and fluid inertia on the final offset , for @xmath66 . in terms of particle inertia , we observe that the final offset decreases with increasing stokes number .",
    "the final offset decreases less when the trajectories undergo pinching , than in the absence of pinching .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we suspect that this behavior is due to the diminished particle inertia resulting from the hydrodynamic resistance offered by the wall . in the case of fluid inertia",
    ", we observe that for @xmath78 the final offset is not significantly affected , irrespective of the presence or absence of the pinching wall . for higher magnitudes of fluid inertia ( @xmath79 ) , we observe that the final offset decreases with the aperture of the pinching gap .",
    "such decrease is comparable to the effect of lift forces in the proximity of the pinching wall , which render the final offset ill - defined . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appa ] , we present the minimum separation @xmath12 as a function of the initial offset @xmath10 , which is consistent with the attenuation of particle inertia and the presence of lift forces ( figures [ fig : bothinertiandwallat30 ] , [ fig : bothinertiandwallat17 ] and the accompanying discussion ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ximindoverdbin2allinertia ] shows that the minimum separation decreases for smaller apertures of the pinching gap for a constant magnitude of inertia .",
    "therefore , similar to the discussion in ",
    "[ subsec : applmodelonlywall ] , we can infer that the critical initial - offset @xmath59 increases with pinching .",
    "further , the minimum separation also decreases with an increasing magnitude of inertia , for a fixed aperture of the pinching gap .",
    "thus , the critical initial - offset increases with increasing particle inertia ( see figures [ fig : onlyinertianowall ] and [ fig : bothinertiandwallat30][fig : bothinertiandwall ] in appendix [ sec : appa ] ) . since @xmath60 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath59 , one might expect that @xmath60 also increases with pinching and inertia .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ figbout : onlyinertianowall ] shows that for a constant @xmath10 , the final offset decreases due to the effect of inertia .",
    "due to such competing effects , the behavior of the critical final - offset as a function of the aperture of the pinching gap and inertia is not obvious .",
    "our simulations indicate , as shown in figure [ fig : bcoutvsrhoratio ] , that the critical final - offset @xmath60 indeed increases with inertia , but the change becomes substantially smaller in the presence of pinching , provided that the effect of lift forces generated due to the pinching wall are negligible ( see also @xmath12 as a function of @xmath1 in figures [ figout : bothinertiandwallat30 ] and [ figout : bothinertiandwallat17 ] in appendix [ sec : appa ] ) .",
    "thus , in conclusion , _ both critical offsets increase with inertia and/or pinching , for a constant range of the non - hydrodynamic interactions @xmath55_. thus , in a mixture of particles of the same size , a particle with sufficiently higher density would exhibit larger critical final - offset @xmath60 than a particle with lower density , thereby rendering its separation possible ( assuming that both particles are subjected to non - hydrodynamic interactions of similar range ) . in the presence of a pinching wall",
    ", a similar inference can be drawn .",
    "although , the change in the critical offsets due to inertia can be expected to be small because of the attenuation of inertia effects by the wall .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of inertia effects and/or a pinching wall , suspended particles driven around an obstacle by a constant force , get closer to the obstacle . using a simple hard - core repulsion model for non - hydrodynamic interactions ( such as solid - solid contact due to surface roughness )",
    "our observations lead to the definitions of critical initial- and final - offsets ( both offsets are equal when inertia is negligible ) .",
    "the offsets increase upon decreasing the aperture of the pinching gap and/or increasing inertia .",
    "when the inertia and pinching effects are combined together , the final offset varies only weakly with inertia . in this case",
    ", we surmise that the presence of a pinching wall attenuates the effect of particle inertia .",

    "similar to the discussion in the main text , here we present the effect that inertia and a pinching wall have on the critical final - offset .",
    "it is clear from the results discussed both in the main text as well as in the previous section that the minimum separation @xmath12 decreases when the aperture of the pinching gap is reduced , or the magnitude of inertia is increased , or both . using the @xmath12@xmath10 plots introduced in the previous section , we elaborate more on the idea of the critical initial - offset @xmath59 , and the effect of pinching and/or inertia on it",
    "further , extending the method , we plot @xmath12 as a function of the final offset @xmath1 for various cases of pinching and inertia , and comment on the behavior of the critical final - offset @xmath60",
    ".              consider figure [ fig : onlywallnoinertia ] in light of the hard - core model of the non - hydrodynamic repulsive interactions explained in the main text .",
    "for a fixed range of the interactions @xmath52 , we have explained in the main text that the critical final - offset completely characterizes the lateral displacement of the particle downstream of the obstacle .",
    "given that the case presented in figure [ fig : onlywallnoinertia ] corresponds to negligible inertia ( stokes regime ) , both critical initial- and final - offsets are equal . thus , figure [ fig : onlywallnoinertia ] can also be interpreted as a plot of @xmath52 versus @xmath54 , and clearly shows that the critical offset @xmath54 increases with a decreasing aperture of the pinching gap .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn concerning the critical initial - offset in absence of a pinching wall using figures [ fig : onlyinertianowall ] and [ fig : bothrestnowall ] , that is , the critical initial - offset increases for a fixed range of the repulsive interactions , with increasing magnitude of fluid and/or particle inertia .",
    "the asymmetry imparted to the particle trajectories by particle inertia , is readily seen in figure [ fig : boutbinresttwographs ] .",
    "this figure supplements the information provided in figures @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the main text .",
    "we observe that , in the absence of a pinching wall , the final offset decreases with increasing particle inertia , while fluid inertia has a weak influence on it .",
    "@xmath1 relationship , in the presence of pinching for two different apertures of the pinching gap .",
    "( left ) the aperture of the pinching gap is @xmath93 ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) , ( right ) the aperture is @xmath84 ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) . ]",
    "figures [ figbout : onlyinertianowallsupp ] and [ figbout : bothrestnowallsupp ] present the effect of inertia on the minimum separation , as a function of the final offset , and complement figures [ fig : onlyinertianowall ] and [ fig : bothrestnowall ] respectively .",
    "these figures show that the critical final - offset increases with the magnitude of inertia for a constant range of the repulsive interactions , @xmath52 .",
    "the presence of both pinching as well as inertia poses the most complex case for analysis , especially , when non - hydrodynamic repulsive forces also play a role .",
    "figures [ figout : bothinertiandwallat30 ] , [ figout : bothinertiandwallat17 ] and [ figout : bothinertiandwall ] are analogous to figures [ fig : bothinertiandwallat30 ] , [ fig : bothinertiandwallat17 ] and [ fig : bothinertiandwall ] , respectively .",
    "again , we see that the effect of pinching is to reduce the minimum separation and that the effect of inertia is small in all three figures . however ,",
    "in figures [ figout : bothinertiandwallat30 ] and [ figout : bothinertiandwallat17 ] , we observe a reversal of the usual trend when @xmath79 , with high inertia leading to smaller values of the final offset .",
