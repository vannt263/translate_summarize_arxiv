    "hydrogen bonding between the complementary base pairs ( @xmath1 and @xmath5 ) is the origin for the watson crick double helical dna structure @xcite .",
    "the secondary interaction via the nearest neighboring stacking interaction also has a major contribution towards the dna structure . the base pair stacking compensates the repulsive electrostatic force of phosphate groups of the two complementary bases which come closer due to hydrogen bonding , henceforth giving stability to the helical conformation .",
    "although this double helix is the most stable form of dna , it is not a static one @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen bonds can intermittently open up and rejoin , even at room temperature and normal salt concentration , without damaging the core of the nucleotide . this transient denatured zone in a dna polymer",
    "is commonly known as a bubble . as the total energy needed to open up a base pair depends on the nature of that base pair ( hydrogen bond interaction ) as well as its neighborhood ( stacking interaction ) , the probability of bubble formation becomes a function of the dna sequence , i.e it is connected to the stability profile of a genome .",
    "it is also important to mention that in most natural dna , the opening probability is much higher due to torsional stress @xcite .",
    "the breathing dynamics of bubble plays a crucial role in the functioning of dna @xcite .",
    "fundamental biological processes like replication and transcription largely rely on the local denaturation .",
    "a recent study on the interaction between the nucleoid - associated protein fis and dna in _",
    "e. coli _ suggests that fis - dna interaction is controlled by dna breathing dynamics and can be regulated experimentally via different nucleotide modifications @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of the dna direct the biological functioning of the living system .",
    "dna breathing is thus a good problem to study , both with respect to its physical and biological perspective .    many experimental techniques , such as , circular dichroism @xcite , uv spectroscopy @xcite , calorimetry @xcite , fluorescence resonant energy transfer ( fret ) measurements",
    "@xcite can map out the melting profile of dna .",
    "using single molecule florescence correlation spectroscopy , breathing dynamics has been monitored and multistep relaxation kinetics with characteristic time scale has been accounted from the study @xcite .",
    "experimental studies have also been performed to explore correlations between the dynamics of hetero - polymeric dna with the biological activities of nucleic acid enzymes @xcite .",
    "theoretical models of the dynamics have also been established based on the dna free energy landscape @xcite .",
    "another way of studying breathing dynamics is by carrying out a stochastic simulation @xcite using the gillespie algorithm @xcite .",
    "sequence sensitivity is one of the pivotal motivations for studying dna breathing dynamics . from the time",
    "series data of the dynamics , information about dna sequence and its stability parameters can be estimated .",
    "single dna manipulation techniques can produce stability parameters and can account for the strong dependence on salt concentration of the breathing dynamics @xcite .",
    "in one of our previous communications we showed that the conjunction of breathing dynamics of hetero - polymeric dna with one of the stochastic optimization technique , namely simulated annealing , can provide data regarding the stability parameters , as well as the activation energy and critical exponent with good accuracy @xcite .",
    "however , the dependence of the breathing dynamics on the individual parameters had not been discussed in earlier work .",
    "we here ask whether can we quantify the relative influence of the system parameters on the breathing dynamics ? to answer this question we quantify the sensitivity of the stability parameters as well as the activation energy and the critical exponent with respect to the breathing dynamics of a hetero - polymeric dna using the approach of sensitivity analysis ( sensa ) .",
    "sensa is used to understand the relative importance of input parameters with respect to the system output .",
    "generally sensa is of two types , local and global @xcite .",
    "local sensa is based on gradient calculation and can account for the local effect of that particular input parameter on the output , for which the calculation is performed .",
    "it generally fails to provide accurate results when all the input parameters come into consideration simultaneously .",
    "the global sensa follows a statistical formulation .",
    "the fundamental theory regarding the global strategy is how the variance of the output is guided by the perturbation on individual input parameters .",
    "global sensa is thus a sampling based technique .",
    "there are various ways to calculate the global sensa and the success of these techniques are system specific .",
    "one of the two most popular method is the measure of correlations between the input and output parameters which is essentially used for systems whose output varies monotonically with the input . but for those systems which do not follow a monotonic trend , the decomposition of the variance represents the best choice for determining sensitivity index .",
    "the most reliable variance based method is efast proposed by saltelli et .",
    "efast is actually based on the fourier amplitude sensitivity test ( fast ) , developed by cukier et.al @xcite and schaibly et.al @xcite . in the variance",
    "based sensitivity test the partitioning of variance ( of output ) is done for determining what fraction of the variance in the output occurs due to the variation of each input parameters .",
    "this is known as the partial variance of output .",
    "the sensitivity of a particular input parameter is estimated using the ratio of the partial variance of the output ( for that particular input ) to the total output variance .",
    "sensa has a wide range of application in different fields like economics @xcite , environmental science @xcite , systems biology @xcite , or chemical kinetics @xcite .",
    "biologists use sensa to understand the robustness of the model output with respect to the variation in model inputs .",
    "this study also helps to analyze the dynamical behavior of the biological model . in chemistry",
    ", there is also a long history of applying sensa in chemical kinetics .",
    "the sensa of rate constants on the reaction kinetics is an important way to understand a kinetic scheme @xcite .",
    "it also has profound implications on parameter optimization @xcite .",
    "we use the correlation coefficient as a measure of the the index of sensitivity for the parameters associated with the breathing dynamics as the breathing dynamics is monotonically related to these parameters . in this communication the pearson correlation coefficient ( cc ) , the rank correlation coefficient ( rcc ) , and the partial rank correlation coefficient ( prcc ) @xcite are calculated for three different dna sequences and their performance compared .",
    "we also discuss the relevance of the sensa on the parameter optimization and how these results can dramatically influence an optimization process .",
    "specifically , we study how the dna breathing parameters , as described by the poland - scheraga model , respond when subjected to a sensa test .",
    "in other words , the gradation of these model parameters on the basis of sensitivity will give us a picture as to which of the model parameters play a more important role in controlling the breathing dynamics . we also pursue the important question whether the sensitivity order is dependent on the nature of the sequence . in an earlier work , stochastic optimization ( simulated annealing )",
    "was demonstrated to extract reliably the interaction energies in dna breathing @xcite . in the present work",
    "we show that taking the sensitivity of individual parameters into consideration , an optimization procedure becomes more efficient in the determination of interaction energies of dna breathing data .",
    "the genetic algorithm , which has a completely different philosophy of operation as that of simulated annealing , is used as the stochastic optimizer in this work .",
    "one of the reason of using genetic algorithm over simulated annealing is that the genetic algorithm , because of the relatively large search space it can sample and exploit , requires a smaller number of optimization steps to converge than that of simulated annealing @xcite .",
    "the stability of the double helical dna hetero - polymer can be explained by considering the two types of watson - crick hydrogen bond interaction between the complementary bases @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 as well as the ten types of stacking interactions between the nearest neighbor base pairs . in numbers , the net free energy released due to opening of a base pair",
    ", whose nearest neighbor base pair to one side is already denatured , is quite low , due to the fact that enthalpy cost and entropy gain almost cancel .",
    "thus the free energy involved to break the strongest interaction , a @xmath5 base pair stacked with a @xmath10 downstream of the dna sequence , is around @xmath11 @xmath12 ( at 37@xmath13 ) , whereas the denaturation of an @xmath1 base pair with a downstream @xmath14 is marginally unstable with free energy change @xmath15 @xmath12 ( at 37@xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "the unzipping of dna double helix is an entropy driven process as it is basically a transformation from an ordered to disordered conformation .",
    "the high binding enthalpy is compensated by the entropy gain .",
    "but for a bubble initiation the activation energy is very high , of the order of 7 - 12 @xmath12 ( for weakest and strongest respectively ) as breaking of two stacking interactions along with the disruption of a hydrogen bond are concerned .",
    "thus it is justified to assume that bubble events are rare and two bubbles are well separated below the melting temperature .",
    "a bubble formation event may be denoted by the position of the left zipper fork ( @xmath16 ) and the size of the bubble ( @xmath17 ) in terms of the right zipper fork @xmath18 .",
    "one can visualize the breathing dynamics as a random walk of a bubble on a triangular lattice of @xmath16 and @xmath17 with forbidden horizontal transition .",
    "the master equation depicting this process @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the probability of the occurrence of a bubble of size @xmath17 at the left zipper fork @xmath16 at a time @xmath21 and @xmath22 matrix include all the allowed transition rates from the state @xmath23 in the triangular lattice .",
    "the transfer rates are defined in terms of the boltzmann factor of hydrogen bonding interaction and stacking interaction @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ swth ] ) , @xmath25 is the boltzmann factor for hydrogen bond at base pair position @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the boltzmann factor for nearest neighbor stacking interaction between the base pairs at @xmath28 and @xmath26 , respectively . at @xmath29 , @xmath20 from eq .",
    "( [ meq ] ) equilibrates to a probability distribution obtained from the statistical mechanical poland - scheraga model @xcite of the dna double helix .",
    "the equilibrium probability of a bubble of size @xmath17 and left zipper fork position @xmath16 can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the bubble partition function @xmath32 eq .",
    "( [ pf ] ) is for bubble size @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 , @xmath35 . moreover , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the ring factor which contributes to the cooperativity factor .",
    "the cooperativity factor is the free energy cost for bubble activation .",
    "the ring factor is the key element for the formation of a small constrained loop in dna double helix @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath38 is the critical exponent and is related to the entropy factor during bubble formation @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath39 accounts for the loss of entropy during the formation of a polymer loop . from the probability expression one",
    "may write the equilibrium mean bubble size @xmath40 , for a sequence of base pair of length @xmath41 as @xmath42",
    "sensitivity analysis is an efficient tool to understand the degree of susceptibility of the system with respect to different input parameters .",
    "the biological functions of dna are actually affected by the bubble dynamics as intermittent bubble opening of base pair helps in binding of rna polymerase , or single - stranded dna binding proteins , etc .",
    "thus it is relevant to study the effect of the stability parameters on the breathing dynamics . to this end",
    "we use sensa as a tool to measure the different weights of the dna breathing model parameters ( hydrogen bond interaction @xmath43 and stacking interaction @xmath44 ) on the process .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the equilibrium probability distribution for bubble formation also involves the ring factor factor @xmath2 and the critical exponent factor @xmath38 , which should have significant effect on bubble formation .",
    "this leads us to consider all fourteen model parameters in the sensa , namely , two hydrogen bond interactions , ten nearest neighbor stacking interactions , as well as the ring factor and critical exponent .    in order to quantify the effect of all fourteen parameters on the breathing dynamics of hetero - polymeric dna",
    ", we consider the mean bubble size @xmath45 as the measure for the breathing dynamics , which can be quantitatively determined via experiment .",
    "the breathing dynamics of hetero - polymeric dna is sensitive to the dna sequence @xcite , which leads us to consider three different dna sequences , the promoter sequence of the t7 phage @xcite , as well as the l42b12 @xcite and admlp @xcite sequences , for the present study to get a complete picture of sensitivity of the breathing parameters .",
    "the promoter sequence of t7 phage is used as the first sequence and is represented as @xmath46    firstly , to start the sensa test , we generate scatter plots of the mean bubble size vs all the parameters for the promoter sequence of t7 phage , which gives a first hand qualitative picture of sensitivity . to generate a scatter plot for a particular input parameter against an output ,",
    "all the input parameters of the system under consideration are perturbed simultaneously and the output is calculated using the set of perturbed parameters . if the output thus generated using the perturbed set of parameters is plotted ( typically known as input vs output scatter plot ) against the values of one specific parameter and falls in a narrow region around a virtual straight line , the corresponding input parameter seems to be more important with respect to that output parameter and is considered to have higher degree of sensitivity .",
    "points dispersed in a circular region in the scatter plot denotes less or no correlation between the input and the output .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] represents the set of the scatter plots generated using the above mentioned procedure for the promoter sequence of t7 phage .",
    "the input data has been picked up by a random process with the mean situated at the reported value ( of that model parameter ) @xcite and the width of the perturbation being @xmath475@xmath48 of the reported value . for most of the input parameters ,",
    "plots appear as a dispersed set of points . only in the scatter plots for the ring factor ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath0",
    ", the distribution of points falls in a narrow strip ( or follow a definite direction ) and hence could be considered to be more sensitive parameters related to dna breathing dynamics .    as the expression for calculating @xmath49 ( see eq .",
    "( [ mb ] ) ) is monotonic with respect to all the fourteen model parameters , we use the measured correlation coefficient using different techniques as the measure of sensitivity index of these model parameters . to this end",
    ", we estimate the pearson correlation coefficient ( cc ) , the spearman or rank correlation coefficient ( rcc ) , and the partial rank correlation coefficient ( prcc ) ( for detail , see appendix a ) for the t7 phage dna .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ t7tab ] .",
    "the set of input parameters is chosen in a similar manner as used for generating the scatter plots , while calculating correlation coefficients ( see appendix a for discussion of the implementation ) .",
    "specifically , the correlation coefficients are computed from a set of 100,000 data points for the generation of input and output data .",
    "the first set of cc , rcc and prcc in table  [ t7tab ] , designated as `` all parameters '' , are calculated by varying all the fourteen model parameters simultaneously .",
    "the values of coefficients obtained from the raw data ( cc ) and rank transformed data ( rcc ) are very close , as the mean bubble size shows a linear dependence on the input parameters . however",
    ", the prcc is much higher in magnitude than the cc and the rcc , which signifies that the effect of a particular input on the output is not independent of the other input parameters .",
    "hence , prcc gives a clearer picture of the parameter sensitivity .",
    "the set of correlation coefficients for all the stability factors ( only @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) and for the stacking interactions ( only @xmath44 ) are also calculated and are presented in table  [ t7tab ] under the column heading of `` excluding @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath37 '' and `` excluding @xmath50 , @xmath37 @xmath51 @xmath52 '' , respectively .",
    "these are calculated by perturbing all the parameters except the excluded parameters which are kept fixed at the corresponding literature values .",
    "this is done to check how the parameter sensitivity order changes with the gradual decrease in the set of parameter variation .",
    "results show that an increase in the values of different correlation coefficients occurs ( as calculated by adopting cc , rcc and prcc ) , but the relative order of the sensitivity remains the same , which is a signature of the linear dependence of the input parameters .",
    ".cc , rcc , and prcc values for the promoter sequence of the t7 phage ( the importance of the numbers in bold are discussed in sec iii ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "a simple way to examine a given parameter s sensitivity is to obtain the degree of correlation of various input parameters to the output .",
    "the correlation coefficient is a quantity to measure how strong the output of a system is linearly associated with the particular input parameter .",
    "it also accounts for the direction ( positive or negative ) of this linear association .",
    "thus it may be used as sensitivity index for a system in which the output varies linearly with the input variables , as it actually accounts for the perturbation on the output when input parameters are varied .",
    "the correlation coefficient of a particular parameter is fundamentally the measure of covariance between the output and that of input parameter , which is then normalised by dividing with the product of the standard deviation of input and output , @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the correlation coefficient of the input parameter @xmath55 and output @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the mean of input and output , respectively and @xmath59 is the number of sampling .",
    "the value of @xmath54 varies from -1 to + 1 .",
    "the ` + ' or ` - ' sign denotes the direction of the linear dependence , i.e , whether the output data increases or decreases with the increase in input parameter . for higher magnitudes of @xmath54 the effect of that particular input parameter will be larger on the output parameter .",
    "then that particular input parameter is said to be highly sensitive with respect to that output .",
    "a very low value of the correlation coefficient means that the output will differ only a little even when the perturbation on input is very high which signifies the lesser sensitivity of that input . if @xmath54 is calculated from the raw data of input and output using eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) , it is known as pearson correlation coefficient ( cc ) .    the parameter dependence may not always be linear .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient is inadequate to show the actual picture of sensitivity of the system in that case .",
    "if one uses rank transformed data instead of the raw data of both the input and output parameters to calculate the correlation coefficient ( known as rank correlation coefficient ( rcc ) ) , it will account for the nonlinear , yet monotonic trend of parameter dependence .",
    "the formal name of rcc is spearman correlation coefficient .",
    "the partial rank correlation coefficient ( prcc ) accounts for the dependence of a particular input with the output after deducting the effect of other inputs .",
    "prcc of a set of inputs @xmath55 and output @xmath56 may be calculated as the rcc of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 account for the effect of other input parameters on that particular input @xmath64 and output @xmath65 .",
    "these can be measured following the regression model @xcite @xmath66 the prcc can also be expressed in terms of the rank correlation matrix ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the matrix element @xmath68 represents the rcc between the @xmath69th and @xmath70th components . if @xmath71 is the co - factor of @xmath68 , then prcc ( @xmath72 ) will be @xcite @xmath73 thus the prcc of input parameters @xmath55 with respect to some output parameter @xmath56 of a system can be written as @xmath74 the correlation coefficient may give the picture of sensitivity properly only if the change of output with the input is monotonic . for",
    "non - monotonic relation one may perform variance based sensitive test .",
    "the implementation of the the correlation coefficient estimation is as follows .",
    "we generate the set of data points of input parameters by randomly perturbing it within the range of @xmath475@xmath48 of the reported literature value @xcite .",
    "the output data is calculated using the perturbed input variables . to estimate the cc ,",
    "these set of input and output data are put into the expression ( [ cc ] ) . for the rcc calculation both the input and output data",
    "are arranged in an increasing or decreasing order and a rank is set for each data .",
    "then the correlation coefficient is calculated with that of rank transformed data .",
    "for prcc calculation we used the second procedure with eq .",
    "( [ prcc ] ) among the two above mentioned techniques .",
    "the rcc between the different input parameters as well as the rcc between the inputs and the output are calculated .",
    "these rcc values could then be arranged in matrix @xmath67 .",
    "the prcc is calculated with the co - factors of this matrix by using eq .",
    "( [ prcc ] ) .",
    "mimicking the experimental scenario of ref .",
    ", one arrives at the equilibrium probability distribution for fluorophore tagged base pairs ( @xmath75 ) using eq .",
    "( [ eqd ] ) .",
    "fluorescence signals appear if the base pairs in the @xmath76 neighbourhood of the fluorophore are open .",
    "the time dynamics of the occurrence of fluorescence is thus related to the breathing dynamics , as local denaturation of all base pairs in @xmath77 is necessary for appearing fluoresce signal ( in our calculation we take @xmath78 ) .      where @xmath80 is the equilibrium probability of the tagged base pair at the @xmath69th position in the sequence for the experimental value of the input parameters and likewise @xmath81 is the equilibrium probability for the set of input parameters obtained in a step , during optimization .",
    "the @xmath82 is actually the difference in these probabilities ( @xmath83 ) and in the course of optimization it decreases .",
