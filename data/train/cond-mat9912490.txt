    "recent advance of nano - technology has stimulated much interest in the study of quantum transport in mesoscopic structures . among the various mesoscopic structures , devices based on quantum dot ( _ qd _ ) have drawn particular attention@xcite .",
    "for the quantum dot structures , electron transport is shown to be affected by the confined electrons in the dot . very recently , novel _ tunable _ kondo effect has been experimentally found in a single electron transistor@xcite , where the level position of the quantum dot and the tunneling rate were controlled by the external gate voltages , via coulomb blockade .",
    "the influence of time - varying fields on the transport through a quantum dot structure is one of potentially interesting areas .",
    "particular applications related to this physics are photo - electron devices , such as single electron pumps , turnstiles , and photon detectors ( see ref . for a review ) .",

    "we wish to study tunneling properties in an interacting quantum dot coupled to superconductors in the presence of an external ac voltage . for this purpose",
    "we first derive a general current formula for this system . using this formula",
    "we investigate two examples of time - dependent transport , pat of quasiparticles and that of the kondo - andreev resonance . when the quantum dot is coupled to a superconductor ( _ s _ ) , the resonant tunneling current is strongly affected by the singular bcs density of states@xcite .",
    "we find that the singularity of bcs density of states plays an important role in the photon assisted quasiparticle transport .",
    "if the coupling between the leads and the _ qd _ is sufficiently weak , the subgap transport is suppressed in the case of small dc bias , but the photon assisted tunneling combined with the asymmetric bcs density of states could allow finite electron transport .",
    "we also investigate the many - body resonance by an ac applied voltage in the _ n - qd - s _ system as an application of the derived current formula .",
