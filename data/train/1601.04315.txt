    "in 1972 ehlers , pirani and schild ( eps ) proposed an axiomatic framework for relativistic theories in which instead of assuming a geometric structure on a differentiable manifold @xmath1 , they assumed worldlines of particles and lightrays as primitive objects defined on @xmath1 itself .",
    "they showed how it is possible to define a geometric structure on @xmath1 assuming only these two primitive objects .",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "once two congruences of worldlines for particles @xmath2 and lightrays @xmath3 on @xmath1 have been defined we can define a _ conformal class of metrics _ @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "two metrics @xmath5 and @xmath6 on @xmath1 are equivalent iff there exists a positive scalar field @xmath7 such that @xmath8    then has been proven that free fall of particle is described by a _ projective class _ @xmath9 $ ] of connections .",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "two connections @xmath10 and @xmath11 are said to be equivalent iff :    @xmath12    for some covector @xmath13 .",
    "it is possible to see that @xmath10 and @xmath11 share the same geodesic trajectories for any convector @xmath13 . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are _ projectively equivalent_.    since both lightrays and mass particles feel the gravitational field we need a compatibility condition between the conformal class @xmath14 associated to light cones and the projective class @xmath15 associated to free fall .",
    "in other words we have to assume that lightlike geodesics are a proper subset of all geodesic trajectories of @xmath10 .",
    "in view of eps - compatibility condition we can see that fixed a representative @xmath10 of the projective structure @xmath15 there always exists a unique covector @xmath16 such that :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "see  @xcite    equivalently , it is possibile to see that the relation between the representative @xmath5 of the conformal structure and the representative @xmath10 of the projective structure has to be :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 are the christoffel of @xmath5 .    in view of eps framework",
    "we will assume a representative @xmath5 of the conformal class @xmath14 ( and two representatives differ for their measurement protocols ) and a ( torsionless ) connection @xmath10 which is related to free fall of test particles .",
    "then dynamics will determine a relation between these two structures .",
    "if dynamics enforces eps - compatibility then the theory is called an _ extended theory of gravitation ( etg ) _ and eps framework is implemented in the field theory .",
    "an example of dynamics which implements eps framework is the class of palatini@xmath0 theories .    in palatini@xmath0 theories we will assume a metric @xmath5 and a ( torsionless ) connection @xmath10 as independent fields and we can use the following lagrangian :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the trace of the ricci tensor @xmath23 of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath5 , namely :    @xmath24    if we have some matter field in the model ( as the electromagnetic field ) we can add a term in the lagrangian :    @xmath25    where we have denoted the set of matter fields by @xmath26 .",
    "this means that the phase space can be represented by local coordinates @xmath27 .",
    "palatini@xmath0 equation of motions are :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 are the matter field .",
    "we can define a conformal factor @xmath30 and we can define another metric :    @xmath31    and the second equation of is equivalent to :    @xmath32    or in other words the connection @xmath10 is the levi civita connection of @xmath6 .    if we trace the first equation of motion with respect to @xmath5 we obtain the so called _ master equation _ ( where the spacetime dimension has been fixed equal to four ) :    @xmath33    with @xmath34 .",
    "the master equation is an algebraic equation ( not differential ) for @xmath22 .    for any given ( regular enough ) function",
    "@xmath35 we can define the conformal factor as done before .",
    "this operation can be seen as a map :    @xmath36    and if this map is invertible we can define the function @xmath37 which will be useful later .",
    "in this section we will introduce the so called _ helmholtz lagrangian_. it is defined as follows :    @xmath38 + { \\mathcal l}_{mat}(g,\\psi)\\ ] ]    where we have considered @xmath39 as independent fields .",
    "equations of this lagrangian are :    @xmath40    it is easy to see that these equations are equivalent to palatini@xmath0 equation   together with the definition of the conformal factor @xmath41 .",
    "this means that the correspondence :    @xmath42    defined by @xmath41 ( or , equivalently , its inverse @xmath37 ) sends solutions into solutions and it is 1-to-1 .",
    "we will call the choice of @xmath43 as independent fields the _ helmholtz frame_.",
    "in this section we will use the freedom allowed on the eps framework in choosing the representatives of the conformal class @xmath14 and of the projective class @xmath15 in order to define other frames and discuss if these frames define equivalent theories .",
    "let us begin transforming the metric in the helmholtz lagrangian .",
    "we shall call the frame described with the coordinates @xmath44 the _ einstein frame _ , where @xmath45 and the helmholtz lagrangian becomes :    @xmath46    which is a standard palatini gr with an additional matter field @xmath47 .    since the transformation @xmath45 is invertible then @xmath48 will give equations which will be equivalent to the equation for helmholtz lagrangian .",
    "now we can transform the connection .",
    "we shall call the frame described with the coordinates @xmath49 the _ brans - dicke frame _ , where we have defined :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 means that the covariant derivative is independent of any connection .",
    "the new lagrangian is :    @xmath52    it can be shown that equations of motion of lagrangian are equivalent to equation of motion of helmholtz lagrangian equations .",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "we have defined several frames and we have discussed the equivalence among them at the lagrangian level . furthermore , the brans - dicke frame provided a palatini version of brans - dicke theory .",
    "indeed if we promote the connection as independent field in the brans - dicke lagrangian , equation of motions will not be equivalent to the original version .",
    "if we couple our lagrangians with a scalar field like the klein - gordon field , we can define and action of the conformal field over the klein - gordon field itself as follows :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the klein - gordon field .",
    "this transformation defines another lagrangian with a `` variable '' mass @xmath55 which is a function of the conformal factor @xmath47 .",
    "since the spectral line of the stars depend on the electric charge and on the mass of the particle we would like to study how they are affected by the conformal factor itself .",
    "further investigations are needed in this way .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the memory of mauro francaviglia .",
    "we acknowledge the contribution of infn ( iniziativa specifica qgsky ) , the local research project _ metodi geometrici in fisica matematica e applicazioni _ ( 2015 ) of dipartimento di matematica of university of torino ( italy ) .",
    "this paper is also supported by indam - gnfm ."
