    "ngc  3256 is a well - studied merging galaxy system and is the brightest ir source in the nearby universe , with a luminosity of @xmath3 in the 81000  @xmath4 m range @xcite , after conversion to a distance of 37  mpc ( h@xmath5 = 75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) .",
    "it is also at the top end of the x - ray luminosity range for starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "tidal tails extending @xmath2 200 kpc and other morphological and kinematical evidence @xcite suggest that the system was composed of two gas - rich disks , which coalesced @xmath21 galaxy crossing time ago @xcite",
    ". however , two `` nuclei '' are detected at radio and nir wavelengths , suggesting that the progenitors may not have completed their merger @xcite .",
    "all observations to date suggest that the system properties are best explained by an ongoing very intense starburst and associated superwind @xcite .",
    "recently , high - resolution _ chandra _ observations of ngc  3256 detected 14 discrete hard x - ray sources with luminosities of 10@xmath710@xmath8 ergs s@xmath6 at an assumed distance of 56  mpc @xcite ; 13 of these remain above @xmath9  ergs  s@xmath6 for a distance of 37  mpc .",
    "such sources are referred to as ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , since their isotropic luminosities are far above the eddington limit of @xmath10  ergs  s@xmath6 for an accreting @xmath11 neutron star in an x - ray binary , but below the limit for classical active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , @xmath12  ergs  s@xmath6 .",
    "possible explanations for ulxs include accreting intermediate - mass ( @xmath21001000 m@xmath13 ) black holes ( imbh ; probably in binaries ) , beamed `` normal '' x - ray binaries , microquasars , transient super - eddington accretors , young supernova remnants ( snrs ) in extremely dense environments , hypernovae / grb s , or background bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "the first large samples of ulxs suggested that they are fairly rare in normal galaxies @xcite , but much more common , and brighter , in merging and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "efforts to identify ulx counterparts at other wavelengths have had limited success : a ulx in ngc  5204 may be associated with a young optical star cluster @xcite , at least four ulxs are associated with x - ray ionized nebulae or snr @xcite , several ulxs in elliptical galaxies may be in globular clusters @xcite , and a radio counterpart recently has been identified for a ulx in ngc  5408 @xcite .",
    "centimetric radio observations penetrate the dust causing the optical obscuration in starbursts .",
    "if radio emission is associated with a ulx , the radio luminosity and spectrum can be used to constrain possibilities for the ulx identity .",
    "previous radio imaging of ngc  3256 identified two bright steep - spectrum nuclear sources @xcite , but had insufficient resolution to probe the ulx environment . here , we present new , high - resolution radio images of ngc  3256 that provide new clues to the nature of its ulxs .",
    "ngc  3256 was observed in 2001 february ( * bna * configuration ) and 2002 april ( * a * configuration ) using the nrao very large array ( vla ) at 6  cm ( 4860  mhz ) and 3.6  cm ( 8460  mhz ) , for @xmath2 7.5hrs each .",
    "a 12-minute 2  cm ( 14940  mhz ) observation was obtained in 2002 april , and a 35-minute 2  cm observation at lower resolution ( * cnb * configuration ) from 1986 was retrieved from the vla archive .",
    "the data were calibrated , self - calibrated , and imaged as described in @xcite .",
    "typical resolutions ( fwhm ) are 50 - 60  pc ( @xmath2035 ) by 140180  pc ( 0710 ) .",
    "we measured flux densities of compact radio sources associated with ulxs by fitting a parabola to the peak , and derived the amount of diffuse emission around the selected sources by integrating over a specified box and subtracting the flux of the related compact source ( table  [ tab : radio ] ) .",
    "errors in radio positions are @xmath1401 , negligible compared to the x - ray position uncertainties of @xmath1506 ; radio flux densities have typical ( @xmath16 ) errors of 5% at 3.6 and 6  cm , and 10% at 2  cm .    at both 6  cm and 3.6  cm ,",
    "two bright compact sources are embedded in diffuse extended emission ( figure 1 ) .",
    "no radio emission is detected outside the central 40  ( 7  kpc ) of the galaxy , with respective @xmath17 limits of @xmath236 and @xmath230  @xmath4jy beam@xmath6 at 6 and 3.6  cm . at the highest resolution",
    "( figure 2 , * a * configuration only ) , 3.6 and 2  cm images resolve both of the bright nuclear sources into several discrete components .",
    "ulx positions from @xcite are indicated on each image ( figures  1 and 2 ) , with the @xcite source numbers used in the remainder of this paper .",
    "ulxs 7 and 8 are coincident with compact radio sources , and ulx  13 is at the location of an extended , partly resolved radio source . properties of these radio sources are given in table  [ tab : radio ] .",
    "radio emission is found at the edges of the 18 radius ( @xmath17 ) _ chandra _ error circles of several other ulxs in ngc  3256 , but is neither compact nor precisely coincident with the x - ray position ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : for example , ulxs 9 , 10 , and 11 are clustered around the edges of a group of compact radio sources , ulx  2 is near the edge of another , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "@xcite note that these are sites of massive stars ionizing their surroundings , as evidenced by strong h@xmath18 emission @xcite .",
    "the nominal separations of @xmath2 2  between radio emission and ulxs correspond to @xmath19 pc in ngc 3256 .",
    "figure  2 shows that ulxs 7 and 8 nominally coincide with the two most compact nuclear radio peaks .",
    "@xcite indicate that the northern x - ray source , ulx  7 , is resolved , with a size of @xmath2115 ( @xmath2180270 pc ) ; they suggest that this corresponds to  a compact grouping of individual sources @xmath20 at the heart of the nuclear starburst .",
    "\" however , mushotzsky ( priv .",
    "comm ) has determined that ulx  7 is a dominant point source ( unresolved by _",
    "chandra _ ) embedded in low - level extended emission , as can be seen in fig 2c .",
    "our 3.6 and 2  cm images ( fig .",
    "2a , b ) indicate that the radio emission at this position is partially resolved on a similar scale and is also embedded in extended emission .",
    "the radio sources near ulxs 7 and 8 have respective spectral indices of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( for @xmath23 ) between 3.6 and 2  cm , indicative of optically thin synchrotron emission . however , the source spectra flatten between 6 and 3.6  cm in matched - resolution images ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , which may indicate that some of the subcomponents are free - free absorbed at longer wavelengths . for gas at 6000  k @xcite , the required emission measure for significant free - free absorption at 5  ghz is about @xmath26  @xmath27  pc .",
    "this implies ( for example ) a typical ionized density of @xmath28  @xmath29 for a path length of @xmath30  pc , or @xmath31",
    "@xmath29 for a path length of 100  pc .",
    "the density in the latter case is similar to that found by @xcite on scales of a few hundred parsecs , but the relatively low filling factor of the gas seen on these large scales makes it likely that any free - free absorption would be caused by higher density gas on scales of a parsec or less .",
    "we use the ratio of 6-cm radio emission to 210  kev x - ray emission , @xmath32 , defined by @xcite , to distinguish further among possible origins of ulxs 7 and 8 .",
    "table  [ tab : rxray ] gives values of this ratio for ulxs in ngc  3256 and for a number of comparison objects .",
    "first , consider flaring x - ray transients .",
    "ulxs 7 and 8 might be either beamed `` normal '' binaries or unbeamed binaries including intermediate - mass black holes ( @xmath0@xmath33 ) . using the peak values in both wavebands , @xcite",
    "compile values of the radio / x - ray ratio for galactic x - ray transients in outburst , and show that it always is less than @xmath34  mjy  crab@xmath6 , corresponding to @xmath35 .",
    "this is consistent with the result of @xcite , who interpret a ulx in ngc  5408 as a beamed x - ray transient ( although they note it could also be an imbh ) ; the faint radio detection implies @xmath36 .",
    "in contrast , ulxs 7 and 8 in ngc  3256 have @xmath37 well above @xmath38 , much larger than the ratio for galactic x - ray transients ; the radio flux densities are more than @xmath39 times stronger than expected from cygnus x-1 beamed toward us from a distance of 37  mpc @xcite .",
    "the northern nucleus of ngc  3256 ( ulx  7 ) is known to harbor an extreme starburst @xcite , so it is worth considering whether the radio and x - ray emission can be produced by only young stars or associated high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) optical and uv emission lines suggest that the ensemble of stars in the northern nucleus has @xmath40 k @xcite , and the x - ray spectrum is consistent with a hot - gas component at @xmath41k @xcite .",
    "a strong upper limit to the number of stars present can be calculated by assuming that the entire 3  mjy flux density at 2  cm is due to thermal emission from ionized gas ( unlikely due to the steep radio spectrum ) ; this would require the equivalent of @xmath42  o7 stars @xcite .",
    "these hot stars would generate x - ray emission primarily in stellar winds ; the expected x - ray luminosity from @xmath39 o7 stars would be @xmath43  ergs  s@xmath6 @xcite , a factor of 1000 below the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "it is likely that a cluster of o stars will contain a significant number of hmxb s .",
    "if systems like cyg x-1 @xcite were to produce all of the ulx  7 x - ray emission , @xmath2600 - 1000 such systems would be required , 1 per 100 o stars .",
    "these hmxbs would produce @xmath44 of the observed radio emission .",
    "although it is possible that the radio and x - ray emission could come from a combination of o stars and many hmxbs , it seems unlikely that this many hmxb s would have already formed while there are still @xmath210@xmath45 unevolved o stars .    since the x - ray and radio sources in ulx 7 both contain multiple components ( diffuse and discrete )",
    ", it seems useful to compare @xmath37 for ulx 7 with better - resolved starburst region in a nearby galaxy .",
    "ngc  253 , at a distance of @xmath2 2.6  mpc , has an x - ray flux of @xmath46 ergs  s@xmath6 ( weaver et al .",
    "2002 ) in its central 5  ( 60 pc ) ; integrating over the same area in the 5  ghz vla image from antonucci & ulvestad ( 1988 ) yields a flux density of @xmath47  mjy .",
    "for this compact nuclear starburst , therefore , @xmath48 , a factor of only a few higher than ulx 7 .",
    "this suggests that ulx 7 may represent a region of extreme `` nuclear '' star formation .",
    "next , we consider the possibility that ulxs 7 and 8 produce x - ray and radio emission in multiple snrs . for the galactic snr cas  a , @xmath49 ,",
    "similar to the values for ulxs 7 and 8 ( cas - a x - ray flux from http://hea-www.harvard.edu/chandrasnr /g111.7 - 02.1/ ; contemporaneous radio flux density derived from baars et al .",
    "the total radio and x - ray fluxes are @xmath50 times stronger than cas  a would be at 37  mpc , implying that many similar snrs would be required within a volume of @xmath39@xmath51  pc@xmath52 . in the case of ulx 13 , associated with a partially resolved steep - spectrum radio source well away from the galaxy nuclei , @xmath53 , also consistent with cas  a , with total emission @xmath54 times more powerful .",
    "some young radio supernovae may have radio powers of tens to hundreds times that of cas  a @xcite , but accounting for the relatively steady radio emission from the ngc  3256 nuclei still would require many supernovae over at least the last 15  yr . the same arguments apply to the case of hypernovae @xcite , with the additional constraint that ngc  3256 has not been identified with any grb s .",
    "a final possibility is that ulxs 7 and 8 are low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) , generated in or fueled by the galaxy merger .",
    "@xcite note that the x - ray properties and overall sed of ulx 8 are consistent with this possibility , but suggest that ulx  7 is to be too strong at 10@xmath4 m to be an agn .",
    "however , @xcite shows that llagns have a maximum in the sed at @xmath210@xmath4 m .",
    "@xcite also finds , when different classes of agn seds are normalized at 1 kev , that llagns are considerably stronger at mid - ir wavelengths than other classes of agn ( @xcite made the sed comparison by normalizing various agn seds at 3.5@xmath4 m ) .",
    "thus , @xcite s work stongly supports the idea that ulx  7 is also a llagn .",
    "both ulxs  7 and 8 have values of @xmath37 well within the range for radio - loud agns , defined by @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 for ulxs 7 and 8 is a factor of a few larger than for several llagns at comparable distances @xcite and for the nearby galaxy nucleus in m32 @xcite , and is similar to the values for the two agns in the merger ngc  6240 @xcite .",
    "further evidence for the llagn possibility comes from examination of archival hst long - slit spectra of the northern nucleus , which show broadened h@xmath18 , h@xmath55 , [ n ii ] , and [ s ii ] emission lines with linewidths of @xmath2450 km sec@xmath6 , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the emission line show a rotation - curve - like shear in their peak velocities of @xmath2300 km sec@xmath6 over a projected distance of @xmath240pc .",
    "if we assume this shear indicates rotation of a nuclear disk , it implies that ulx 7(n ) has a mass of _ at least _",
    "10@xmath56m@xmath13 within @xmath57 pc .",
    "llagns are the most plausible explanation for ulxs  7 and 8 in ngc  3256 , although large collections of supernova remnants are also consistent with their radio / x - ray ratios and powers .",
    "if ulxs  7 and 8 are llagn , the dual black holes are separated by only @xmath30  kpc , considerably closer than the @xmath58  kpc separation for the dual agns in ngc  6240 .    for the remaining ulxs that are not associated with discrete radio sources , the radio / x - ray limits are consistent with expectations for high - mass x - ray binaries , either beamed or accreting at super - eddington rates , and ulx 13 is also consistent with a collection of confined snrs .",
    "we have presented new , high resolution , sensitive radio images of the merging galaxy ngc  3256 .",
    "we found that three compact radio sources appear to be identified with ulx s .",
    "two of the ulx s are coincident with the two galaxy nuclei , and have properties indicative of being two llagn , separated by @xmath58 pc .",
    "radio properties of a third ulx suggest that is is a large complex of supernova remnants , and the remaining ulx s are likely associated with hmxrbs or imbhs .",
