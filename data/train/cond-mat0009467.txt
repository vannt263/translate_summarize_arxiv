    "quasiperiodic precipitation patterns emerging in the wake of chemical reaction fronts are called liesegang patterns .",
    "they have been studied for more than a century and a number of theoretical approaches have been developed to explain the experimental observations @xcite . nevertheless , it was only recently that a model with input parameters fewer than the number of static and dynamic parameters characterizing the patterns has appeared @xcite .",
    "this last theory is based on the assumption that the main ingredients of a macroscopic description should be a moving reaction front and the phase separation of the reaction product behind the front .",
    "taking the properties of the reaction front from the theory of the fronts in the @xmath2 process @xcite and describing the phase separation process by the cahn - hilliard equation @xcite , one arrives at a model with a minimal number of parameters .",
    "the above theory successfully explains that the positions , @xmath3 of the precipitation bands form a geometric series , @xmath4 ( spacing law @xcite ) , and gives the spacing coefficient @xmath5 in terms of the initial concentrations of the reactants @xmath6 and @xmath7 in agreement with the matalon - packter law .",
    "furthermore , the parameters in the model can be determined from experiments and the time - scale of the emergence of a band can be calculated @xcite .",
    "finally , the width law relating the position and the width of the bands can also be derived in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "the success and versatility notwithstanding , this theory needs further developments since , in its present form @xcite , it is a mean field theory without the fluctuations being accounted for .",
    "there are two ways to include the fluctuations .",
    "one is to add conserved thermal noise to the cahn - hilliard equation as it is done in model b of critical dynamics @xcite . in this case",
    ", there would be an additional problem of handling the noise in the reaction zone .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , however , that this noise is irrelevant for @xmath8 so , in principle , it could be neglected .    in this work ,",
    "another approach is taken for including the fluctuations .",
    "namely , we shall study the kinetic ising model version of the process and thus include the noise through the probabilistic description of the transitions between discrete states of the system .",
    "there are several reasons for our choice .",
    "first , the problem of difference between the handling of fluctuations in the diffusive and reaction processes does not arise .",
    "second , the kinetic ising version of the model has a meaning of a mesoscopic ( or perhaps a microscopic ) description . since the mechanism of band formation may be at work at a length - scale that makes possible the construction of submicron liesegang structures , this kinetic ising model approach may have a direct bearing on future experiments @xcite .",
    "third , our choice was also influenced by having more expertise in simulations of kinetic ising models .",
    "we shall start ( sec.ii . ) by a detailed discussion of the kinetic ising model designed to describe the band formation .",
    "the simulation results for this model are presented in sec.iii .",
    "first , the @xmath0 case is treated where we do not find regular band formation .",
    "then the @xmath1 simulations are discussed which show the emergence of liesegang patterns satisfying the usual spacing law .",
    "final comments about the difficulties of predicting temperature - dependent effects in liesegang phenomena can be found in sec.iv .",
    "the aim of the theories of liesegang phenomena is to explain how a high - concentration electrolyte @xmath6 diffuses into a gel soaked by a low - concentration electrolyte @xmath7 and how the spatial distribution of the precipitate @xmath9 is formed in the wake of the diffusive reaction front .",
    "accordingly , all the theories follow the scheme a+bcd .",
    "[ a+b->c->d ] where @xmath10 is an intermediate reaction product which is generally not very well known .",
    "this uncertainty is then the basis for the existence of a number of competing theories with the differences arising from the interpretation of @xmath10 and from the level of details in the description of the dynamics of @xmath10-s .",
    "a significant drawback of all these theories is that they contain a large number of parameters and many of them are uncontrollable experimentally .",
    "thus it is not entirely surprising that thorough comparisons between experiments and theories have not been carried out .      in our view",
    ", the uncertainty about the intermediate product and its dynamics can be used to advantage in building a general theory of band formation .",
    "one can interpret the concentration of @xmath10-s , @xmath11 , as a kind of _ order parameter _ that takes a value @xmath12 in the ordered ( precipitate ) phase and another value @xmath13 in the disordered ( low - density ) phase .",
    "the @xmath10-s are obtained from the @xmath2 process so they are produced in the reaction zone .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of @xmath10-s obeys global conservation and it should be a phase - separation type dynamics since , in the expected final state , one has regions of high- ( precipitation ) and low - density ( interband ) regions in equilibrium .",
    "this phase - separation dynamics can be described on a coarse - grained level by the cahn - hilliard equation @xcite with the generation of @xmath10 appearing as an additional source term .",
    "the resulting equation for the space- and time - dependent order - parameter density , @xmath14 is given by @xcite _",
    "c= -+ s(x , t ) .[move ] here @xmath15 is a kinetic coefficient , @xmath16 is the landau - ginzburg free energy of the system which should have two equal minima at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the term @xmath19 with @xmath20 provides stability against short - wavelength fluctuations , and finally @xmath21 is the production rate of @xmath10-s in the reaction - diffusion process @xmath22 .",
    "the properties of the source are known .",
    "it is localized , its center , @xmath23 , moves diffusively ( @xmath24 ) , and it leaves behind a uniform concentration @xmath25 of @xmath10-s .    the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath26 in eq.([move ] )",
    "can be used to set the time - scale and length - scale , respectively , and the source , @xmath27 , is completely specified by the initial densities ( @xmath28 ) and diffusion constants ( @xmath29 ) of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . only the function @xmath16 remains to be parametrized .",
    "one expects that the details of this function will not affect the overall properties of the pattern - formation process , the existence of two minima at @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the only important feature .",
    "thus , assuming e.g. a coexistence curve that is symmetric about @xmath30 , one can parametrize this function as @xmath31 .",
    "the scale of the concentration can be set by the parameter @xmath32 and @xmath33 remains a free parameter in the theory .",
    "consequently , one has a theory which has only a single adjustable parameter apart from the parameters setting the scale of the length , time , and the concentration field .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , all the observed general features of liesegang phenomena can be derived from the above theory @xcite , including the time - scale of the emergence of a single band and the length - scale for the width of the bands .",
    "actually , it is somewhat surprising that the mean - field level description in terms of eq.([move ] ) performs so well .",
    "the reason for this may lie in the experimental observation that the patterns are frozen ( they do not evolve over time - scales extending up to 30 years @xcite ) meaning that the dynamics takes place at a very low effective temperature , i.e.  the noise is negligible .    the noise may indeed be negligible in the late stages of the formation of precipitation bands but the initial stages should be related to some instabilities and there the fluctuations should play a more prominent role . in particular , the mean - field description relies on a spinodal - decomposition instability ( the moving front generates particles and pushes the concentration past the spinodal ) and the possibility for the precipitation to take place through a nucleation - and - growth mechanism ( where the fluctuations are important ) is completely lost .      in order to include fluctuations in the liesegang process , a kinetic ising model will now be considered that is , we believe , a finite - temperature extension of the theory embodied in eq.([move ] ) . the model introduced below can be viewed in two ways .",
    "either it is a discretization scheme to equation ( [ move ] ) and then the description is on a mesoscopic level with @xmath14 being the discretized concentration of the order parameter , @xmath10 . or , it can also be viewed as a simulation of the stochastic motion of @xmath10-s which are now particles at microscopic scales ( in this case the coarse graining has been carried out in time ) . in the following",
    "we shall use the latter `` particle '' language .",
    "let us begin the introduction of discretized description by identifying the particles @xmath10 with the up - spins of an ising model on a hypercubic lattice .",
    "then the down - spin sites are empty places and the formation of precipitation bands is modeled by a combination of spin - flip and spin - exchange dynamics @xcite .",
    "namely , the initial state is prepared with all spins down ( no @xmath10 particles present ) and the localized front flips the down spins ( glauber dynamics  @xcite ) thus producing the @xmath10-s .",
    "the flip rate @xmath34 at site @xmath35 is given by w_r = s(x , t)(1-_r ) , [ fliprate ] where @xmath36 is the ising spin at site @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the coordinate in the direction of the motion of the reaction front while @xmath39 representing the coordinates in the transverse direction ( length is measured in units of the lattice spacing @xmath40 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath41 ensures that the front flips only down spins ( the particles are produced in the front and the back reaction is negligible ) .",
    "finally , @xmath21 is a function describing the motion of the reaction front and the change of the reaction rate with time .",
    "the front is assumed to be homogeneous in the transverse direction and its actual shape , @xmath21 , can be taken from the solution and simulations of @xmath2 process . since the width of the reaction zone is small and it changes with time very slowly , for all practical purposes , the function @xmath21 can be approximated by a constant within a small interval @xmath42 $ ] around the center of the reaction zone @xmath24 s(x , t)= [ s_i ] .",
    "where @xmath43 is the step function and the amplitude a = c_0 [ a ] is chosen such that the front leaves behind a constant @xmath44 concentration of particles .",
    "once the particles are created , they diffuse and interact .",
    "this part of the dynamics can be described by a spin exchange process ( kawasaki dynamics  @xcite ) .",
    "the rates of the exchanges are assumed to satisfy detailed balance at temperature @xmath45 with ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath46 ) between the spins in order to describe the expected attraction among the @xmath10 s . assuming the usual nearest - neighbor ising hamiltonian h =- j_<r , r>_r_r , [ isingham ] the rate of exchange between neighboring sites @xmath35 and @xmath47 can be chosen to be @xcite w_r= ^-1 [ exchrate ] where @xmath48 sets the timescale , @xmath45 and @xmath49 are the temperature and the boltzmann constant , respectively , and @xmath50 is the change in the energy @xmath51 due to the exchange of spins at @xmath35 and @xmath47 .    without the spin - flip dynamics",
    ", the system would relax to the equilibrium of the ising model at temperature @xmath45 and at fixed magnetization . thus choosing the temperature low enough ( below @xmath52 of the ising model ) and making the spin - flip front produce the right magnetization density",
    ", the system will be in the unstable part of the phase diagram of the ising model and phase separation will take place .",
    "if this model represents the pattern forming process correctly then one expects the emergence of bands of up and down spins in the wake of the moving spin - flip front .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of the kinetic ising model described above have been performed in dimensions d=2 and 3 .",
    "the dimension - specific properties of the lattices used in the simulations will be given in the appropriate subsections below .",
    "here we enumerate and discuss only those adjustable parameters which are used independently of dimension :    * the temperature @xmath45 is measured in units of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the nearest - neighbor coupling of the ising model ( [ isingham ] ) .",
    "it is clear from the considerations of the previous section that @xmath55 should be used . * the particle concentration , @xmath25 , deposited by the front",
    "must be chosen so that , at the given @xmath45 , it places the system in the metastable or unstable region of the phase diagram of the ising model .",
    "* length is measured in units of the lattice spacing @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath40 depends on the interpretation of @xmath10 and @xmath40 can be a microscopic length - scale as well as a mesoscopic one . * time is measured in units of the `` microscopic '' timescale @xmath56 [ see eq.([exchrate ] ) ] .",
    "again , this timescale may be coming from microscopic or mesoscopic processes depending on the interpretation of @xmath10 . *",
    "the diffusion coefficient of the front ( @xmath57 ) is , in principle , a well defined quantity @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the connection between the microscopic and macroscopic length- and time - scales , however , makes it difficult to set a value for @xmath57 in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath56 .",
    "we shall thus treat @xmath57 as a parameter that can be freely varied .",
    "* the width of the reaction front ( @xmath58 ) does not appear to influence the emerging patterns ( this is the experience both from the mean - field theory @xcite and from small scale simulations ) .",
    "thus , in most of our simulations , we set @xmath59 i.e.  the front coincides with one of the lattice planes perpendicular to the motion of the front .",
    "the three important parameters are @xmath45 , @xmath25 and @xmath57 , and one should search for pattern formation in this three dimensional parameter space .",
    "this is not necessarily an easy task since it is known , both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , that patterns are formed only in a restricted domain of the available free parameters . since our search is finite , our statements ( especially about the absence of patterns ) are always pertinent only to the parameter domain investigated .",
    "simulations have been performed on stripes of length @xmath60 and width @xmath61 or @xmath62 with periodic boundary conditions in the transverse ( @xmath63 ) direction .",
    "@xmath60 was chosen to be long enough so that no end effects would be observed with @xmath64 being a typical value .",
    "the initial position of the front was always at @xmath65 and we used closed boundary conditions ( no particle crossing ) at both @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    the possible formation of patterns was investigated for the following ranges of the adjustable parameters : @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "about 200 sets of values have been studied in the above domain and no regular patterns were observed .",
    "a typical result is displayed in fig.[fig : d2random ] for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we have also made a few simulations outside of the above domain in order to check the possible strong effect of the changes in a single parameter .",
    "these nonsystematic searches did not lead to pattern - forming regimes either .",
    "we have extended the simulations to cases where the interactions are not restricted to nearest neighbors but extend up to seven lattice spacings .",
    "no patterns were found , although the randomness of the pattern slightly decreased when the range of the interaction was increased .",
    "this is expected as in the limit of long - range interactions one should reach a continuum , noiseless limit . thus the cahn - hilliard description [ eq.([move ] ) ] should apply and we should observe regular band formation .",
    "the nonexistence of regular banding should not be considered as a contradiction with the experimental observations of @xmath0 liesegang patterns .",
    "the experimental systems always have macroscopic width in the third dimension and this appears to stabilize the patterns .",
    "indeed , fig.[fig : d2+eps ] shows a simulation with the same parameters as those in fig.[fig : d2random ] , except an extra layer in the third dimension is added .",
    "as one can see , the bands in the two - layer system are much better defined and they display some regularity .",
    "note in particular , that the concentration within the bands in fig.[fig : d2+eps ] has reached the equilibrium value @xmath73 while the maximum concentration regions in fig.[fig : d2random ] are roughly halfway in between the equilibrium values , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the simulations were performed on slabs of length @xmath60 and of cross - section of size @xmath76 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used in the transverse ( @xmath77 ) directions while closed boundary conditions were employed at the two ends of the slabs . as in the two - dimensional case , @xmath60 was chosen so ( @xmath78 ) as to avoid end effects from the transverse wall at @xmath67 .",
    "most of the simulations were done for @xmath79 and @xmath80 in order to observe finite - size effects .",
    "the initial condition was again an empty ( all spins down ) state with the front situated at @xmath65 .",
    "precipitation patterns were observed for @xmath81 if @xmath82 was chosen well in the metastable or unstable region of the phase diagram of the d=3 ising model . for large front diffusion ( @xmath83 ) , these patterns were not regularly spaced and were not stable .",
    "namely , coarsening was observed within reasonable observation time ( time of formation of about 7 - 10 bands ) .",
    "a typical example is shown on fig.[fig : d3random ] .",
    "the bands are more stable at lower temperatures ( @xmath84 ) and their spacing becomes more regular , as the front diffusion coefficient is decreased below @xmath85 . for @xmath86 ,",
    "one observes the emergence of liesegang type band patterns , typical examples being those shown on fig.[fig : d3liese]a - c . in this case , the system is of size @xmath87 ) and the parameter values used are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "results of runs for three cross sections ( @xmath88 and @xmath80 ) are displayed . comparing these pictures",
    ", one can not see any obvious finite - size trends .    in order to investigate the spacing law",
    "one would need a large number of bands .",
    "unfortunately , in the regime where the best liesegang type patterns are obtained one is restricted in the extent of explorations by the computing resources . due to the low value of @xmath57 , the front is moving very slowly and consequently the computation time for obtaining e.g.  10 bands becomes very large .",
    "the cpu time necessary to produce the pattern on fig.[fig : d3liese]a was about 1500 hours on a sun ultra-10 workstation .",
    "fig.[fig : d3liese ] shows roughly the limits of the possibilities of our simulations at present . to establish the spacing law firmly",
    ", we would certainly need more bands .",
    "using the last 4 - 6 bands obtained from pictures similar to those on fig.[fig : d3liese ] , one can see that the positions of the bands ( @xmath3 ) do approximate a geometric series @xmath4 well , and one can extract an approximate the spacing parameter , @xmath5 .",
    "in general , we find that the spacing coefficient does not show discernible finite - size trends .",
    "for example , the spacing parameter is @xmath89 for all values of @xmath90 in fig.[fig : d3liese ] .    an interesting feature of the patterns emerging in our simulations is the presence of material ( @xmath10 ) in between the bands ( see figures [ fig : d3random]a - c and [ fig : d3liese]a - c ) . of course , it is not entirely clear whether part of this material should be considered as a low density precipitate ( seen in many experiments @xcite ) or should it be just regarded as a `` gas '' phase of particles @xmath10 .",
    "visual inspection of the interband region reveals the presence of both small clusters and single particles .",
    "the small clusters live long ( especially at lower temperatures ) , their lifetime is comparable to the time of formation of several bands .",
    "thus the interpretation of part of the interband material as low density precipitate may have some validity . in order to make progress in this problem",
    ", one would need larger scale simulations as well as more understanding of the connection between the microscopic and macroscopic time- and length - scales .",
    "apart from the simplicity , an important feature of our model is that fluctuations are included .",
    "a frequent consequence of the presence of fluctuations is the disapperance of order in low dimensions and , indeed , our simulations also indicate that liesegang type patterns are absent in @xmath0 dimension while they exist in @xmath1 dimensional samples .",
    "another advantage of including the noise is that the model has pattern - forming regimes which have characteristics of either the prenucleation theories or the postnucleation competitive growth theories @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can see ( fig.[fig : d3liese]b ) that the bands are forming at the position of the reaction front for @xmath57 small , while the bands are formed as a result of coarsening and competitive growth well behind the front in case of large @xmath57 ( fig.[fig : d3random ] ) .",
    "note that the absence of liesegang type patterns in the second regime is in agreement with the inability of producing such patterns in postnuclation competitive growth theories @xcite .",
    "we feel that the most important feature of the model is that it makes clear that the important and experimentally controllable parameters are @xmath45 , @xmath25 and @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , both @xmath25 and @xmath57 are known functions of the initial densities ( @xmath28 ) and diffusion constants ( @xmath29 ) of reagents @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the @xmath2 reaction . although the diffusion constants @xmath91 and @xmath92 are usually not controllable , @xmath93 and @xmath94 can be set to given values and , consequently , @xmath25 and @xmath57 can be varied independently .    among the three parameters ,",
    "a change in @xmath45 leads to unpredictable changes in the various diffusion coefficients and background processes in a real liesegang experiment ( for example , the diffusion coefficients of the background ions may also be important @xcite in determining the spacing coefficient ) .",
    "thus it is advisable to keep the temperature constant , and the most promising and , indeed , most often used way of looking for trends in experiments is the change of the concentrations of the inner and outer electrolytes ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "an obvious consequence of our simulations is that one should be able to observe a crossover from prenucleation regime to a regime where postnucleation processes are dominant .",
    "namely this could be achieved by tuning @xmath93 and @xmath94 in such a way that , at fixed @xmath25 , the front diffusion coefficient @xmath57 would be varied over as much a range as possible .",
    "this work has been supported by the swiss national science foundation and by the hungarian academy of sciences ( grant otka t 029792 ) .                                up to few years ago , the smallest distances between bands achieved in experiments were of the order of @xmath95 .",
