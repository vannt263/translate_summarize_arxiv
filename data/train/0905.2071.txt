    "a complete description of complex polymers , such as proteins , includes information about their structure and their dynamics .",
    "in particular it is of utmost importance to answer the following questions : what are the structural conformations possible ?",
    "is there any relevant hierarchy among these conformers ?",
    "what are the transition paths between them ?",
    "these and other questions can be addressed by analyzing in an efficient way the free energy landscape of the system . with this knowledge",
    ", several problems about biomolecular reactions ( such as enzymatic activity , protein folding , protein deposition diseases , etc ) can be tackled . in this article",
    "we show how to efficiently describe the free energy landscape for small and large peptides . by mapping the trajectories of molecular dynamics simulations into a graph ( the conformational markov network ) , and unveiling its structural organization ,",
    "we obtain a coarse grained description of the protein dynamics across the free energy landscape in terms of the relevant kinetic magnitudes of the system .",
    "therefore , we show the way to bridge the gap between the microscopic dynamics to the macroscopic kinetics by means of a mesoscopic description of the associated conformational markov network . along this path",
    "the compromise between the physical nature of the process and the magnitudes that characterize the network is carefully kept to assure the reliability of the results shown .",
    "polymers and , more specifically , proteins , show complex behavior at the cellular system level , _ e.g. _ in protein - protein interaction networks @xcite , and also at the individual level , where proteins show a large degree of multistability : a single protein can fold in different conformational states @xcite . as a complex system @xcite",
    ", the dynamics of a protein can not be understood by studying its parts in isolation , instead , the system must be analyzed as a whole .",
    "tools able to represent and handle the information of the entire picture of a complex system are thus necessary .",
    "complex network theory @xcite has proved to be a powerful tool used in seemingly different biologically - related fields such as the study of metabolic reactions , ecological and food webs , genetic regulatory systems and the study of protein dynamics @xcite . in this latter context",
    ", diverse studies have analyzed the conformational space of polymers and proteins making use of network representations @xcite , where nodes account of polymer conformations .",
    "additionally , some studies have tried to determine the common and general properties of these conformational networks @xcite looking at magnitudes such as clustering coefficient , cyclomatic number , connectivity , etc .",
    "recently , trying to decompose the network in modules corresponding to the free energy basins , the use of community algorithms over these conformational networks have been proposed @xcite .",
    "although this approach has opened a promising path for the analysis of free energy landscapes ( fel ) , the community based description of the network leads to multiple characterizations of the fel and thus it is difficult to establish a clear map from the communities found to the basins of the fel .",
    "a similar approach , commonly used to analyze the complex dynamics , is the construction of markovian models .",
    "markovian state models let us treat the information of one or several trajectories of molecular dynamics ( md ) as a set of conformations with certain transition probabilities among them @xcite .",
    "therefore , the time - continuous trajectory turns into a transition matrix , offering global observables as relaxation times and modes . in @xcite the use of markovian models is proposed with the aim of detecting fel meta - stable states .",
    "however , the above approaches to analyze fels of peptides involves extremely large computational cost : either general community algorithms or large transition matrices .    finally , other strategies to characterize the fel that have successfully helped to understand the physics of biopolymers , are based on the study of the potential energy surface ( pes ) @xcite .",
    "the classical transition - state theory @xcite allows us to project the behavior of the system at certain temperature from the knowledge of the minima and transition states of the pes .",
    "this approach entails some feasible approximations , such as harmonic approximation to the pes , limit of high damping , assumption of high barriers , etc .",
    "these approximations could be avoided working directly from the md data .    in this article",
    "we make a novel study of the fel capturing its mesoscopic structure and hence characterizing conformational states and the transitions between them .",
    "inspired by the approaches presented in @xcite and @xcite , we translate a dynamical trajectory obtained by md simulations into a conformational markov network .",
    "we show how to efficiently handle the graph to obtain , through its topology , the main features of the landscape : conformers and their basins of attraction , dwell times , rate constants between the conformational states detected and a coarse - grained picture of the fel .",
    "the framework is shown and validated analyzing a synthetic funnel - like potential .",
    "after this , the terminally blocked alanine peptide ( ace - ala - nme ) is studied unveiling the main characteristics of its fel .",
    "in this section we show the round way of the fel analysis : the map of microscopic data of a md into a conformational markov network ( cmn ) and , by unveiling its mesoscopic structure , the description of the fel structure in terms of macroscopic observables .",
    "first , we encode a trajectory of a stochastic md simulation into a network : the cmn .",
    "this map will allow us to use the tools introduced henceforth to analyze a specific dynamics of complex systems such as biopolymers .",
    "the cmn has been proven to be a useful representation of large stochastic trajectories @xcite .",
    "this coarse grained picture is usually constructed by discretizing the conformational space explored by the dynamical system and considering the hops between the different configurations as dictated by the md simulation . in this way , the nodes of a cmn are the subsets of configurations defined by the conformational space discretization and the links between nodes account for the observed transitions between them .",
    "the information of the stochastic trajectory allows to assign probabilities for the occupation of a node and for the transitions between two different configurations .",
    "defined as above , a cmn is thus a weighted and directed graph .",
    "our cmn is constructed as follows .",
    "the conformational space is divided into @xmath0 cells of equal volume , therefore every node @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) of the cmn contains the same number of possible configurations .",
    "next , by evolving a stochastic trajectory enough time steps ( of length @xmath3 ) to assure the ergodicity condition we can define the final cmn set up .",
    "we assign to each node a weight , @xmath4 , that accounts for the fraction of trajectory that the system has visited any of the configurations contained in node @xmath1 ( the following normalization @xmath5 holds ) .",
    "second , a value @xmath6 is assigned to each directional link , accounting for the number of hops from node @xmath7 to node @xmath1 .",
    "note that transitions between configurations contained in the same node are also considered by @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ the network can also contain self - loops . finally , the weights of the outgoing links from a node @xmath7 , @xmath9 , are conveniently normalized so that @xmath10 .",
    "the cmn constructed in this way , is described by a single matrix @xmath11 and a vector whose components are the occupation probabilities @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the matrix @xmath13 is the transition probability matrix of the following markov chain , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the instant probability distribution of the system at time @xmath16 .",
    "since the matrix @xmath13 is ergodic and time invariant , one can compute the stationary distribution associated to the markov chain , @xmath17 , that satisfies @xmath18 .",
    "the latter stationary distribution has to be identical to the computed weights of the network nodes , @xmath19 ( @xmath2 ) , provided the stochastic trajectory is long enough .",
    "moreover , the detailed balance condition , @xmath20 must hold thus relating the elements of matrix @xmath13 to the stationary probability distribution .",
    "therefore , the transition matrix @xmath13 appears to be the minimal descriptor of the stochastic trajectory and , as consequence , of the cmn .",
    "provided the md trajectory is long enough to consider the sample in equilibrium , the weight - distribution of nodes in the cmn will be the stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ evolves ] ) and detailed balance condition ( [ balance ] ) will be fulfilled @xcite . however , this property is not enough to consider the model markovian : although the continuous trajectory will be produced using langevin dynamics ( and therefore inherently markovian in the phase space @xcite ) the discrete representation of the cmn and the integration of momenta defies the markovian character of our model @xcite .",
    "several methods are proposed in the literature to validate markov models @xcite . in order to obtain a reliable description ,",
    "specially about those magnitudes related to the time evolution of the system ( see subsection temporal hierarchy of basins ) , the time step @xmath3 must be large enough to avoid memory effects @xcite",
    ".    a detailed check and discussion about the markovian character of the networks shown in this article can be found in the _ supporting information text ( si)_.          to illustrate the cmn approach and the methods presented below , we introduce here a synthetic potential energy function , that serve us as a toy model where results can be easily interpreted .",
    "this potential energy is reminiscent of that funnel surfaces recurrently found when the fel of proteins are studied @xcite . in particular , we have considered a two - dimensional system where a particle moves in contact with a thermal reservoir and whose potential energy is given by , @xmath21 where we have set @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . as shown in figure [ funnel]a the above potential energy confines the movement of the stochastic trajectory inside a finite region of the conformational space .",
    "however , thermal fluctuations allow the particle to jump between several basins of attraction .",
    "a stochastic trajectory has been simulated using an overdamped langevin dynamics and the equations of motion have been integrated with a fourth order stochastic runge - kutta method @xcite .",
    "figure [ funnel]c shows the region of the conformational space visited by the particle .",
    "we have conveniently discretized the two - dimensional space into pixels of equal area and computed their corresponding occupation probabilities . thereby , with the transition probabilities between pixels , the trajectory is represented as the cmn shown in figure [ funnel]b .",
    "the question now is : can we recover the topology of the fel ( derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : funnel ] ) ) from the cmn representation ?      up to now , we have illustrated the conversion of molecular dynamics data into a graph ( the cmn ) .",
    "now , we show how to efficiently obtain the thermo - statistical data from the mesoscopic description of the cmn .      inspired by the deterministic steepest descent algorithm to locate minima in a potential energy surface we propose a _",
    "stochastic steepest descent _ ( ssd )",
    "algorithm to define basins on the discretized fel . dealing with the nodes and links as we describe below",
    ", the proper structure of the cmn is unveiled to call the modules obtained conformational macro - states or basins .",
    "picking at random one node of the cmn , say @xmath29 , and an initial probability distribution @xmath30 ( @xmath2 ) , the markov process relaxes according to @xmath31 .",
    "the whole probability concentrated in node @xmath29 at time @xmath32 , in a single time step @xmath33 , evolves driving the maximum amount of probability down hill over the fel .",
    "the next node @xmath34 in the descendent pathway from @xmath29 is taken by following the link that carries maximum probability flux .",
    "focusing again all the probability in node @xmath34 , @xmath35 we continue the pathway from @xmath29 towards a local fel minimum by identifying the next node @xmath36 for which the probability current @xmath37 is maximal . iterating this operation for each node of the cmn",
    ", we obtain a set of disconnected descent pathways that help us to define the basins of attraction .",
    "we establish formally the above procedure assisted by a vector @xmath38 ( with @xmath2 ) that label the nodes :    * we start by assigning @xmath39 .",
    "* select at random a node @xmath40 with @xmath41 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath40 has not been labeled yet ) and start to write an auxiliary list @xmath42 of nodes adding @xmath40 as the first entry in this list . * search , within the neighbors of the node @xmath40 , a node @xmath43 so that @xmath44@xcite and check which of the following options is fulfilled : 1 .   if @xmath45 and @xmath46 : add @xmath43 to the list @xmath42 and go again to _",

    "the process returns to step _ ( iii ) _ with the next exception : since this step has been iterated @xmath52 times for the same node @xmath40 ( being @xmath53 the number of coordinates discretized to construct the cmn ) , @xmath40 is stated as local minimum and @xmath54 . in this case @xmath55 for those nodes @xmath56 and the process comes back to step _",
    "( ii)_.    the whole procedure ends when no nodes unlabeled remain in the cmn , @xmath57 @xmath58 . the restriction introduced in step ( _ iii_.c ) with the dimensionality",
    "@xmath53 avoids a transition from a local minimal energy configuration to any other node of the same basin or to a deeper local minimum of a different basin .",
    "when every node of the cmn has been visited , the conformational space is completely characterized and we have thus traced all the maximum descent pathways from any node to the local fel minima . finally , all those nodes with the same label @xmath59 belong to the same fel basin and therefore they are associated to the same conformational state . the result of the procedure is the partition of the cmn in a set of modules which correspond to basins of attraction of the discretized conformational space .    to illustrate the basin decomposition of a cmn",
    ", the ssd algorithm has been applied to the funnel - like potential .",
    "the result is the detection of six basins in agreement with the number of local minima in its fel ( figure [ funnel]b and [ funnel]c ) .      with the aim of studying biomolecules and systems with high degree of dimensionality , the way to detect these fel basins",
    "must be computationally efficient .",
    "the method described above takes a computational time @xmath60 , once the @xmath52 largest hooping probabilities @xmath61 are computed for all the nodes in the network .",
    "additionally , the method is deterministic providing with a unique partition of the cmn into different modules .",
    "these two characteristics make this analysis faster and more straightforward than any other partitioning method @xcite .",
    "these advantages come from the knowledge of the physical meaning of links and nodes of cmns . in the _",
    "si _ other community algorithms ( newman s modularity and markov clustering algorithm ) are tested over our toy model system .",
    "none of the algorithms reported in the _ si _ give a satisfactory result mapping the modules obtained with the free energy basins .      to get a more comprehensible representation of the fel studied , a new cmn network can be built by taking the basins as nodes .",
    "the occupation probabilities of these nodes as well as the transition probabilities among them can be obtained from those of the original cmn as @xmath62 @xmath63    where @xmath1 and @xmath7 are indexes relative to the nodes of the original cmn and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are indexes for the basins ( new nodes ) .",
    "note that the new coarse - grained cmn has its weights normalized and fulfills the detailed balance condition eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) .",
    "figure [ funnel]d shows the corresponding coarse - grained for the funnel - like potential .",
    "the weighted nodes and links have a clear physical meaning @xcite .",
    "considering the transition state @xmath66 and assuming local `` intra - basin '' equilibrium , the rate constant of this transition is @xmath67 ( where @xmath33 is the time interval between snapshots used to make the original cmn ) .",
    "the relative free energy of the basin @xmath64 , taking basin @xmath65 as reference , is @xmath68 . besides , the expected waiting time to escape from @xmath64 to any adjacent basin is @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "other magnitudes , such as first - passage time for inter - basins transitions and other rate constants relaxing the local equilibrium condition @xcite can also be computed from the original cmn .    the ability to define the proper regions of the conformational space in an efficient way let us compute physical magnitudes of relevance .",
    "for instance , the coarse - grained cmn is nothing but a graphical representation of a kinetic model with @xmath70 ( the number of basins ) coupled differential equations : @xmath71    ) .",
    "the original basins merge in function of time .",
    "both hierarchies reveals a coarse - grained behavior of two macro - states : @xmath72 and @xmath73.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      the first hierarchy aims to answer the following question : what is the structure of the cmn when nodes with lower weight than a certain threshold are removed together with their links ?",
    "let us take the control parameter @xmath74 as the threshold to restrict the existence of the nodes in the original cmn .",
    "where @xmath75 is the _",
    "`` adimensional free energy '' _ of a node @xmath1 relative to the most weighted node @xmath76 .    with the above definitions we start a cmn reconstruction by smoothly increasing the threshold from its zero value",
    "at each step of this process , we obtain a network composed of those nodes with free energy lower than the current threshold value . as the free - energy cut - off increases , new nodes emerge together with their links .",
    "these new nodes may be attached to any of the nodes already present in the network or they can emerge as a disconnected component . at a certain value of @xmath74 , some components of the network become connected by the links of a new node incorporated at this step .",
    "a hoshen - kopelman like algorithm @xcite is used to detect the disconnected components of the network at each value of the threshold used : from zero until all the @xmath0 nodes of the cmn were already attached .",
    "this bottom - up network reconstruction provides us with a hierarchical emergence of nodes along with the way they join together .",
    "this picture can be better described by a process of basins emergence and linking that is easily represented by means of a basin dendogram .",
    "this representation let us guess at first glance the hierarchical relationship of the conformational macro - states and the height of the barriers between them .",
    "let us remark that the transition times can not be deduced from these qualitative barriers since the entropic contribution or the volume of the basin are not reflected in this diagram .",
    "the basins family - tree obtained for the funnel - like ( see figure [ dendo]a ) reveals that , despite of having a two - dimensional potential with the shape of a funnel , one can not describe it as a sequence of metastable conformations that drive the system to the global minimum .",
    "moreover , the diagram shows a roughly similar behavior as for a double asymmetric well , composed by two sets of basins : @xmath77 and @xmath73 .",
    "the cmn representation of a md simulation provides with another hierarchical relationship that is meaningful to understand the behavior of the biological systems .",
    "the links of the original cmn have been weighted according to the stochastic matrix @xmath11 .",
    "taking into account the markovian character of the process , we can make use of the chapman - kolmogorov equation to generate new transition matrices at times @xmath78 , @xmath79 , etc ... formally , the markov chain at sampling time @xmath80 is defined by the matrix :    @xmath81^{m}\\;.\\ ] ]    for each value of @xmath43 a new cmn is defined .",
    "this family of cmns have different weighted links but the same weights @xmath4 for the nodes as the original one ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "it is worth to discuss the behavior of the matrix @xmath83 . in the limit @xmath84",
    "we have @xmath85 independently of the initial state @xmath86 .",
    "this means that any node is connected to a given node of the network with the same weight , regardless of the initial source .",
    "therefore , only one basin would be detected by the ssd algorithm since every node is connected with the most weighted link to the most weighted node in only one step .",
    "from the original @xmath33-description of the fel to the integrated ( @xmath87 ) one , we can devise another algorithm to establish a second hierarchy of the basins by performing the next two operations : first , for each value of @xmath43 a new cmn is generated by constructing the matrix @xmath88^{m}$ ] and second , the ssd algorithm is applied to this new cmn .",
    "the process finishes when only a basin ( the whole network ) is detected ( for large enough values of @xmath43 ) . by using this technique",
    "we can observe how basins merge with others at different time scales ( labeled by the integer @xmath43 ) .",
    "the result of this procedure performed for the funnel - like potential is shown in figure [ dendo]b . at @xmath89 only two basins",
    "are observed : @xmath90 and @xmath73 , being the largest plateau observed for any of the nontrivial arrangement of basins found .",
    "therefore , the macroscopic description in time is in agreement with the free energy hierarchy described previously .",
    "it is clear that the number of basins decrease as @xmath43 increases",
    ". one should be aware that the concept of basin depends dramatically on the time resolution at which the cmn is built , and this time limits also the resolution in the fel structure .",
