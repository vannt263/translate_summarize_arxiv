    "the creation of the ultracold dense gas of polar molecules is an important research goal since the heteronuclear molecules possessing a permanent electric dipole moment are promising candidates for numerous applications ranging from the ultracold controlled chemistry to the quantum simulations of many - body physics  @xcite .",
    "polar alkali - metal dimers have already been produced in their absolute rovibrational ground state close to the quantum degeneracy  @xcite and employed in many groundbreaking experiments  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the promise of exciting applications , the creation of ultracold polar molecules with a spin structure and a magnetic dipole moment is currently emerging as another important research goal  @xcite .    the simplest diatomic molecules with a spin structure and a magnetic dipole moment are those in the electronic state of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the former ones can consist of a closed - shell atom such as sr or yb and an open - shell atom such as rb or f , whereas the latter ones can be found in the alkali - metal dimers . until now",
    ", ultracold dense gas of the @xmath4 state molecules in the rovibrational ground state has not yet been produced albeit the efforts being undertaken to direct laser cool molecules such as srf  @xcite or yo  @xcite and photo- or magnetoassociate molecules such as rbyb  @xcite and rbsr  @xcite .",
    "the magnetoassociation of the @xmath4 state molecules , though possible , is rendered very difficult due to the small resonance widths  @xcite .",
    "the ultracold dense gases of alkali metal - dimers in the @xmath5 state have already been produced  @xcite but they may undergo chemical reactions and the use of an optical lattice to segregate the molecules and suppress losses may be necessary  @xcite .",
    "recently , more and more atoms with a complex electronic structure have been cooled down and investigated at low or ultralow temperatures .",
    "on one hand , the fesbach resonances in the mixtures of the yb atoms in the metastabe @xmath6 state with the ground state yb  @xcite or li  @xcite atoms have been explored .",
    "on the other hand , the bose - einstein condensate or fermi degeneracy of highly magnetic atoms such as cr  ( @xmath7 )  @xcite , er  ( @xmath8 )  @xcite , or dy  ( @xmath9 )  @xcite have been obtained and the fano - feshbach resonances were observed in the ultracold gas of the er atoms  @xcite .",
    "this opens the way for the formation of ultracold molecules containing these atoms .",
    "the chromium  alkali - metal - atom molecules such as crrb  @xcite and the chromium  closed - shell - atom molecules such as crsr or cryb  @xcite have been proposed as candidates for molecules with both large magnetic and electric dipole moments .",
    "the molecules formed from the er or dy atom and the alkali - metal or alkaline - earth - metal atom may be polar and will have a large magnetic dipole moment .",
    "unfortunately , the density of the interaction - anisotropy - induced feshbach resonances between the lanthanide atoms with the large electronic orbital angular momentum is very high  @xcite and the chaotic behavior in the interaction between these atoms  @xcite may make the magnetoassociation of heteronuclear molecules difficult . at the same time , the density of the feshbach resonances between the highly magnetic eu atom in the spherically symmetric @xmath10 electronic ground state will be lower  @xcite , and molecules containing this atom may also be polar and will have a large magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the buffer - gas cooling and magnetic trapping of the eu atoms were demonstrated  @xcite and the further cooling to the quantum degeneracy will not be more challenging than the already demonstrated production of the ultracold gas of the similar cr atoms  @xcite or other lanthanide atoms with a more complex electronic structure  @xcite .",

    "the molecules in the @xmath16 electronic state inherit the large magnetic dipole moment of the eu atom @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the bohr magneton ) , whereas the magnetic dipole moment of the molecules in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 electronic states is @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .    in the present work",

    "<S> the spin restricted open - shell coupled cluster method restricted to single , double , and noniterative triple excitations , rccsd(t ) , was employed and the scalar relativistic effects within the small - core energy - consistent pseudopotentials were included . </S>",
    "<S> the permanent electric dipole moments and static electric dipole polarizabilities were computed . </S>",
    "<S> the leading long - range coefficients describing the dispersion interaction between atoms at large internuclear distances @xmath3 are also reported . </S>",
    "<S> the euk , eurb , and eucs molecules are examples of species possessing both large electric and magnetic dipole moments making them potentially interesting candidates for ultracold many - body quantum simulations when confined in an optical lattice in combined electric and magnetic fields . </S>"
