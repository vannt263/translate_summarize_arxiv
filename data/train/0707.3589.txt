    "walker metric @xcite and the friedmann equations @xcite which govern the expansion behavior of the universe are used extensively in cosmology , and are at the core of this carefully and tightly woven paradigm . however , it is probably fair to say that the friedmann equations , while providing a very self - consistent and highly successful framework for cosmology , have not been subjected to extensive , independent testing . in this paper",
    "we show that one particular aspect of general relativity , i.e. , the self - gravity of pressure can be tested quantitatively .",
    "the development of sophisticated big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) codes @xcite , coupled with measurements of the relevant nuclear reaction rates @xcite , have allowed observations of light elemental abundances to become powerful tools with which to investigate the evolution of the early universe .",
    "computational predictions over a wide range of parameter space , when compared with observations , have yielded constraints on the current - epoch baryon density @xcite , neutrino physics @xcite , the fine structure constant @xcite , the gravitational constant @xcite , primordial magnetic fields @xcite , and other parameters of astrophysical interest .    increasingly exact measurements of elemental abundances , as well as augmented understanding of the processes ( i.e. , stellar nucleosynthesis ) which have altered the original abundances , allow these restrictions to be continually refined .",
    "deuterium abundances @xcite , helium abundances @xcite , and lithium abundances , including the effects of stellar mixing @xcite have all been well measured .",
    "more recently , observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have yielded an independent estimate of @xmath0 , the baryon to photon ratio @xcite .",
    "in the standard friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) cosmology , the expansion of the scale factor , @xmath1 , of the universe as a function of its density and pressure is given by the friedmann equations . in terms of @xmath2 , the `` acceleration '' of the scale factor",
    "is given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy density and @xmath5 is the pressure .",
    "this is an exact solution of the @xmath6 einstein field equation for a homogenous and isotropic universe .",
    "note that the @xmath7 term , implying the self - gravity of pressure , has no analog in newtonian gravity .",
    "the other well - used form of the friedmann equations : @xmath8 arises from the @xmath9 component of the einstein field equations ( for a flat universe ) . for any fluid with a significant pressure , and given its appropriate equation of state , eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be integrated to yield eq .",
    "( 2 )  but only , of course , if the @xmath7 term is included .",
    "it could be argued that eq .",
    "( 2 ) is adequate to derive the evolution of the scale factor , and yet it depends only on @xmath10 , and not explicitly on @xmath5 .",
    "yet , we know that without the @xmath7 term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the constant of proportionality in front of @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) will be incorrect , as long as pressure is significant .",
    "the friedmann equations have been frequently derived from newtonian theory , in the context of a _ pressureless _ ( @xmath11 )",
    "universe , both for scientific and strictly pedagogical reasons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , since the concept of self - gravity of pressure does not exist in newtonian gravity , it follows that eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can not be properly derived from any purely newtonian construction @xcite .",
    "finally we note that the friedmann equation given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) ( in which @xmath5 does not explicitly appear ) formally `` knows '' about the form of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ( which does contain @xmath5 ) via the bianchi identity .",
    "consider now the radiation dominated epoch of the universe which prevailed for the first few thousand years after the big bang .",
    "let us start with the friedmann equation in the form of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . from special relativistic considerations",
    "alone , we know that @xmath12",
    ". therefore the @xmath13 equation can be written as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is used as a placemarker for the pressure term ( i.e. , @xmath16 if the pressure term is present , and @xmath17 if not ) . since @xmath18 for radiation and relativistic particles ( e.g. , neutrinos ) undergoing an adiabatic expansion , eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be integrated to yield : @xmath19 variation of the value of @xmath15 away from unity would would significantly affect the outcome of bbn , degenerate with a variation in @xmath20 ( the gravitational constant ) or @xmath21 ( the number of neutrino families ) .",
    "however , assuming these latter two to be constant at their nominal values of 1 and 3 respectively , nucleosynthetic constraints are able to place limits on @xmath15 and thus test the validity of this aspect of general relativity in this regime .",
    "nucleosynthesis calculations were performed with the canonical kawano bbn codes @xcite which have been modified and updated with the latest reaction rates .",
    "the codes offer the ability to alter relevant early universe parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath20 . since the parameter we seek to constrain , i.e. , @xmath22)/2 , is multiplicative with @xmath20 , we simply vary @xmath20 as a surrogate . altering the parameters over repeated runs of these codes yields abundances of light elements as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath15 .    in this",
    "work @xmath2375000 bbn calculations were performed , varying @xmath15 between @xmath24 and 7 in steps of 0.02 ( or equivalently @xmath25 from 1/4 to 4 in linear steps of 0.01 ) and varying @xmath26 from @xmath27 to @xmath28 in steps of 1/200 dex .",
    "the result of these calculations , is a grid of @xmath29 , @xmath30 pairs , each point with a set of associated elemental abundances ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "as estimated in @xcite the uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates leading to deuterium are 3.4% ( 95% confidence limit ) , and as estimated in @xcite @xmath310.1% ( 95% confidence limit ) for he-4 .",
    "deuterium provides an excellent constraint because , as has been understood for the last few decades , the observed amounts necessitate that it must have formed in the big bang rather than in stellar or galactic processes @xcite .",
    "it is equally fortunate that it is extremely sensitive to the baryon to photon ratio , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "deuterium measurements from along the line of sight to high redshift quasars have culminated in the current determination of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 confidence ; * ? ? ?",
    "contours of constant deuterium abundance are shown as green curves in fig.1 .",
    "lithium-7 was initially a frontrunner as a nucleosynthetic constraint .",
    "however it has somewhat fallen out of favor because of large uncertainties arising from the systematic effects in stellar depletion models .",
    "@xcite determine the primordial lithium abundance as @xmath34 ( @xmath33 confidence ) , which while consistent at the 1-@xmath35 level with the estimates derived from other light elements , is unable to provide any additional significant constraint due to the relatively large error bars .",
    "until this situation can be improved , lithium-7 will not likely play a strong role in constructing bbn - based parameter limits .",
    "contours of constant lithium abundance are shown as purple curves in fig.1 .",
    "helium-4 , though not as sensitive to @xmath0 as deuterium , also serves as a useful constraint on @xmath15 .",
    "the primordial abundance is determined from present - day observations of hii regions , coupled with models of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the primordial he-4 mass fraction , @xmath36 , is most recently reported to be @xmath37 ( @xmath33 confidence ; * ? ? ?",
    "contours of constant helium-4 abundance are shown as blue curves in fig.1 .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background are able to provide an independent estimate of the baryon / photon ratio @xmath38 ( i.e. , @xmath0 in units of @xmath39 ) .",
    "the _ wmap _",
    "collaboration @xcite gives as the three - year measurement @xmath40 .",
    "this measurement assumes @xmath16 , and therefore does not provide any additional constraint .",
    "however , as shown in figure 1 , the _ wmap _ value of @xmath38 is in excellent agreement with the light element constraints .",
    "figure 1 displays the results of our analysis . a section of the @xmath29",
    ", @xmath30 parameter space is shown , with _ number _ density ( relative to hydrogen ) contours for deuterium shown in green , and for _ mass _ fraction of he-4 shown in blue .",
    "the purple contours represent the li-7 number density ( relative to hydrogen ) .",
    "the boldest contours indicate the current best abundance determinations , with the adjacent intermediate - width contours indicating the corresponding ranges of uncertainties ( @xmath33 confidence ) .    assuming statisically - independent gaussian errors",
    ", one can calculate the probability , via a maximum likelihood analysis , that the abundance determinations agree with the corresponding results of the bbn calculations at a given point in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 parameter space .",
    "only the constraints due to d and he-4 were used to compute the uncertainties in @xmath15 and @xmath0 ( see  2.3 for an explanation of why li-7 was not included ) . the black ellipse is the 90% probability contour .",
    "as illustrated in figure 1 , the combined constraints correspond well with the general relativity prediction of @xmath16 and the wmap constraint on @xmath38 .",
    "the 90-percent confidence contour gives a limit of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we have used current light element observations and bbn computations as a test of the general relativistic self - gravity of pressure .",
    "the agreement is good to within @xmath23@xmath42 .",
    "we reiterate that our result can also be expressed as a constraint on the newtonian constant , @xmath20 ( during the bbn epoch ) , the number of light neutrino families , or degeneracies among neutrinos ( see  1 for references ) . assuming that these latter parameters take on their nominally expected values , then the self - gravity associated with the pressure of light and neutrinos during the bbn epoch has been quantitatively measured .                                                              , d.  n. , bean , r. , dor , o. , nolta , m.  r. , bennett , c.  l. , dunkley , j. , hinshaw , g. , jarosik , n. , komatsu , e. , page , l. , peiris , h.  v. , verde , l. , halpern , m. , hill , r.  s. , kogut , a. , limon , m. , meyer , s.  s. , odegard , n. , tucker , g.  s. , weiland , j.  l. , wollack , e. , & wright , e.  l. 2007 , , 170 , 377"
