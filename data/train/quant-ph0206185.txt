    "one of the principal aims of information theory is to establish a link between two different kinds of quantities .",
    "one is an operational quantity which is defined as the optimal or limiting value of a concrete parameter such as code length , compression rate , transmission rate , convergence rate of error probabilities , etc .",
    "the other is an information quantity such as the entropy , divergence , mutual information , etc .",
    "note that the latter , in its definition , is more abstract than the former , and the meaning of the latter is usually clarified by linking it to the former . in the so - called information spectrum method which first appeared in a series of joint papers of han and verd ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "the process of establishing such a link is intentionally divided into two parts by introducing a third kind of quantity  _ information spectrum _ , putting it between an operational quantity and an abstract information quantity .",
    "this setting allows us to pursue many problems of information theory in their most general forms ; see @xcite for the whole perspective of the method .",
    "for instance , let us consider two sequences of random variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 for each @xmath4 are supposed to take values in a common discrete ( finite or countable ) are arbitrary measurable spaces . ] set @xmath5 subject to probability distributions ( mass functions ) @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath8 does not need to be the product set @xmath9 of an @xmath10 , although the notation suggests that the product set is a representative example of @xmath8 .",
    "han @xcite studied the hypothesis testing problem for the simple hypotheses consisting of the general processes @xmath11 and @xmath12 by means of the information spectrum , which is the asymptotic behavior of the random variable @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) in this case .",
    "he succeeded in representing several asymptotic characteristics of hypothesis testing in terms of the information spectrum with no or very few assumptions on the processes .",
    "the term ` spectrum ' is intended to mean that the scope of the theory covers the general case when the probability distribution of @xmath13 does not necessarily get concentrated at a point , but may spread out , as @xmath15 .    the purpose of the present paper is to extend , complement and refine han s analysis of hypothesis testing from several viewpoints .",
    "the biggest motivation comes from the question of how to extend the analysis to quantum hypothesis testing .",
    "following the above setting , we are naturally led to consider the problem of hypothesis testing for the simple hypotheses consisting of two sequences of quantum states @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are density operators on a common hilbert space @xmath20 for each @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is by no means obvious whether a similar analysis to that of han is applicable to the quantum setting .",
    "we show in this paper that it is actually possible to extend han s results by appropriately choosing a quantum analogue of the information spectrum so that both the classical and quantum cases are treated in a unifying framework .",
    "although this does not mean that application to a special class of quantum processes such as i.i.d .",
    "( independent and identically distributed ) ones immediately yields significant results , it seems to suggest a new approach to studying the quantum asymptotics and to elucidating a general principle underlying classical / quantum information theory .",
    "it should be noted that , even though the statements of our theorems are almost parallel to those for the classical setting , some of the proofs are essentially different from the original proofs of han .",
    "the technique of information - spectrum slicing , which was effectively used in @xcite to prove several important theorems , consists of a procedure of partitioning a set and does not straightforwardly apply to the quantum setting .",
    "we are thus forced to look for another idea for proofs .",
    "fortunately , we have successfully found a way which does not need information - spectrum slicing and is applicable to the quantum setting .",
    "moreover , the new proofs are much simpler than the original ones even in the classical case .",
    "this simplification is a byproduct of our attempt to pursue quantum extensions .",
    "this paper also contains results such as those of theorems  [ thm : be * ] and [ thm : r*e ] which improve the corresponding original theorems when applied to the classical setting .",
    "in addition , from the beginning , we treat generalized hypothesis testing in the sense of han @xcite , namely that the alternative hypothesis @xmath7 can be any nonnegative measure .",
    "this enables us to unify hypothesis testing and fixed - length source coding in a natural way .",
    "this paper aims at presenting a unifying framework to treat the classical and quantum generalized hypothesis testing problem in the most general and simplest manner . after presenting the notation in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , the concept of information spectrum is introduced in section  [ sec : info_spec ] for both classical and quantum cases . in sections",
