    "submillimeter ( submm ) wavelength blank - field surveys discovered a population of heavily dust - obscured starburst galaxies at high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "these submm galaxies ( smgs ) contribute a large fraction of the comoving infrared ( ir ) luminosity density at high - redshift @xcite , and their clustering properties indicate they could be progenitors of the most massive galaxies at @xmath13 @xcite . the number counts and dust production rates of these massive , high - redshift starburst galaxies actually place tight constrains on galaxy formation models @xcite .",
    "the identification of optical counterparts to the submm sources has mainly been based on the identification of radio counterparts , detected through deep very large array ( vla ) 20 cm imaging .",

    "for about @xmath15 of all submm sources precise positions can be determined from an identification of faint radio counterparts @xcite .",
    "however , the depth of current radio observations limits the identification of submm sources to @xmath16 , since due to the strong k - correction , the radio flux ( unlike the submm flux ) drops rapidly with redshift @xcite . the only unambiguous way to localize the highest - redshift smgs in the optical / near - ir is via submm interferometry .",
    "radio - selected smgs have been found to have a median redshift of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , recent interferometric submm imaging of a flux - limited sample of smgs has provided substantial evidence that up to @xmath18 of this population is likely located at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these radio - dim smgs appear to be inconspicuous at optical wavelengths , likely obscured by large amounts of dust , and their nature can only be revealed in the ir @xcite . to date , only five such high - redshift smgs have been confirmed spectroscopically @xcite . in this paper",
