    "the rigid rotor model is a very important concept in quantum mechanics that is discussed in most textbooks .",
    "we only recall that it is basic for understanding rotational spectroscopy and collisions of molecules . as is well known a mathematical model for rigid rotor is a free particle constrained to a surface of a sphere @xcite . in this work",
    "we study the quantum dynamics of a free particle on a sphere in the case when the initial condition is a coherent state .",
    "the coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a sphere are unstable with respect to the free evolution , nevertheless , in opposition to the motion in a plane , the corresponding wave packets do not spread . consequently , the dynamics is nontrivial . in particular",
    ", the evolution of the wave packets leads to beats in the expectation values of position observables for a particle on a sphere .",
    "we begin with a brief account of the quantum mechanics on a sphere .",
    "as shown in @xcite the most natural algebra for the study of the motion on a sphere @xmath0 is the @xmath1 algebra of the form @xmath2={\\rm i}\\varepsilon_{ijk}j_k,\\quad [ j_i , x_j]={\\rm i } \\varepsilon_{ijk}x_k,\\quad [ x_i , x_j]=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the angular momentum operator and @xmath4 is the position operator for a particle on a sphere . in fact , the algebra ( 1 ) has two casimir operators given in a unitary irreducible representation by @xmath5 in the following we restrict to the irreducible representations of ( 1 ) with @xmath6 i.e.  the unit sphere and the  most classical \" case of @xmath7 . then the angular momentum basis spanned by the common eigenvectors of operators @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is defined by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a nonnegative integer and @xmath14 .",
    "besides of the standard action of the angular momentum operators @xmath15 on the basis vectors @xmath16 such that @xmath17 we have the following relations satisfied by the position operators @xcite    @xmath18    where @xmath19 .",
    "we finally write down the orthogonality relations satisfied by the vectors @xmath16 such that @xmath20 and the completeness condition which in the case of @xmath7 takes the form @xmath21 coherent states for the sphere ------------------------------",
    "we now summarize the basic facts about the coherent states for a particle on a sphere .",
    "the coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a sphere @xmath0 were introduced by us very recently @xcite .",
    "these states were generalized by hall and mitchell @xcite to the case involving @xmath22-dimensional sphere .",
    "for @xmath23 they reduce to the coherent states for a particle on a circle @xmath24 introduced by us in the paper @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and utilized for the construction of coherent states on a torus @xcite .",
    "an alternative construction of coherent states for the sphere @xmath25 , @xmath26 , was described by daz - ortiz and villegas - blas in a very recent work @xcite .",
    "the coherent states can be defined as the solution of the eigenvalue equation @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 where the cross designates the vector product .",
    "the operator @xmath28 and @xmath30 satisfy @xmath31 the first equation of ( 10 ) is evident in view of the relation @xcite @xmath32 the coherent states @xmath33 can be generated from the coherent state @xmath34 ( fiducial vector ) , where @xmath35 , via @xmath36     the projection of the coherent state on the basis @xmath16 is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 are the gegenbauer polynomials and @xmath39 is the sign of @xmath40 .",
    "the coherent states are not orthogonal .",
    "we have @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the legendre polynomials .",
    "the natural parametrization of @xmath43 by points of the classical phase space is given by @xmath44 , fulfil @xmath45 and @xmath46 , that is we assume that @xmath47 is the classical angular momentum , @xmath48 is the norm of the vector @xmath47 , and @xmath49 is the radius vector of a particle on a unit sphere .",
    "introducing the spherical coordinates @xmath50 , and parametrizing the tangent vector @xmath47 by its norm @xmath48 and the angle @xmath51 between @xmath47 and the meridian passing through the point with the radius vector @xmath49 , we get from ( 16 ) the following natural parametrization of the phase space compatible with the constraints ( see @xcite ) : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the unit mutually orthogonal vectors .",
    "the correctness of the introduced coherent states for a sphere is confirmed by the good behavior of quantum averages .",
    "namely , we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 , with @xmath43 given by ( 16 ) , and the approximation is very good . from computer calculations it follows that for @xmath57 , the relative error is of order 1% .",
    "furthermore , the computer simulations indicate that @xmath58 where the approximation is as good as in ( 18 )",
    ". we point out that the factor @xmath59 in ( 19 ) is related to the fact that @xmath4 is not diagonal in the coherent state basis . proceeding analogously as in the case of the coherent states for a circle @xcite",
    "one can introduce relative expectation value @xmath60 of @xmath4 with respect to averages in the coherent states labelled by unit vectors @xmath61 , so that @xmath62 .",
    "yet another evidence of correctness of the described coherent states is behavior of the corresponding wave functions such that @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are the common eigenvectors of the position operators @xmath66 spanning the coordinate representation .",
    "namely , the probability density @xmath67 of the coherent state given by ( 15 ) is @xmath68 where @xmath69 , is peaked at @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "consider now a free particle on a sphere .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume that the particle has a unit mass and it moves in a unit sphere .",
    "clearly the quantum hamiltonian is given by @xmath72 as with standard coherent states of harmonic oscillator the discussed coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a sphere are not stable with respect to the free evolution .",
    "this can be demonstrated easily for the coherent state @xmath34 given by ( 13 ) using first equation of ( 3a ) and the relation @xcite @xmath73 therefore , in view of ( 12 ) none of the coherent states is stable .",
    "nevertheless , in opposition to coherent states for a particle on a plane the corresponding wave packet ( 20 ) do not spread .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath74 where @xmath75 . hence taking into account ( 20 ) we find that the time - dependent coherent state in the coordinate representation is @xmath76 it thus appears that @xmath77 is @xmath78-periodic function of time . from ( 25 ) and ( 21 ) it follows immediately that the probability density for the coordinates at time @xmath79 is @xmath80 the probability density ( 26 ) is a periodic function of time with period @xmath78 .",
    "thus it turns out that the wave packets on a sphere referring to coherent states do not spread but rather resemble maintaining their shape solitons . as a result of oscillations of the probability density",
    "an interesting phenomenon takes place that can be regarded as quantum beats on a sphere .",
    "more precisely , consider the following natural counterparts of the classical spherical coordinates for a free particle on a sphere @xmath81 where @xmath82 and the use was made of the relation ( 19 ) , and @xmath83 where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 corresponds to the position and @xmath47 to the angular momentum of a particle .",
    "we point out that correctness of the formula corresponding to ( 28 ) was demonstrated in the case of the quantum mechanics on a circle @xcite .",
    "the explicit formulas for the expectation values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 that can be derived with the help of ( 7 ) , ( 3a ) , ( 5 ) and ( 14 ) are too complicated to reproduce them herein . from numerical calculations",
    "it follows that whenever the condition @xmath88 holds then the dynamics of @xmath89 showing amplitude modulation is similar to well known acoustical beats ( see fig .  1 ) . clearly , the condition @xmath88 is a counterpart of the requirement of slightly different frequencies of two waves whose superposition is the  beat \" wave .",
    "the values of @xmath89 oscillate around @xmath90 marking the coherent states via @xmath91 ( see ( 16 ) ) .",
    "the minimum in the amplitude of oscillations of @xmath89 is reached at @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is integer , so the period of beats is @xmath78 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath94 resembles the classical one in the limit @xmath95 , that is the uniform motion in a circle .",
    "indeed , the plot of @xmath94 is piecewise linear with constant slope for @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the only exception is @xmath99 when the amplitude of @xmath89 is minimal .",
    "namely at @xmath99 we have two kinds of behaviour of the angle @xmath94 shown in fig .",
    "2 . first is the simple pulse and the second one the oscillation around @xmath100 .",
    "interestingly , these two types of graphs of the function @xmath94 at @xmath99 occur alternately i.e.  for @xmath101 we have oscillation , for @xmath102 we have a pulse , for @xmath103 an oscillation and so on .",
    "it is worth mentioning that that the distinguished role of @xmath99 is also present in the behavior of the probability density ( 26 ) having at @xmath99 the saddle point ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . as a result of beats the trajectory on a sphere parametrized as @xmath104 is not a grand circle as in the classical case but resembles the family of grand circles possessing a common diameter ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]             it should be noted that the discussed exotic dynamics of the rigid rotor is related to the free dynamics on a sphere that does not preserve the coherence .",
    "in fact , the coherent states for the quantum mechanics on a sphere are stable with respect to the evolution generated by the hamiltonian @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a constant vector .",
    "the stability of the coherent states is an immediate consequence of the identity @xcite @xmath107 implying via ( 8) @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 is given by @xmath111 in order to compare the quantum dynamics in the case of the free evolution discussed previously and that given by ( 28 ) we now restrict to @xmath112 , so @xmath113 .",
    "evidently , with such @xmath106 there exists a classical solution corresponding to the uniform motion in the equator .",
    "using the identities @xmath114 we find that relations ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) take the form @xmath115 it thus appears that @xmath89 and @xmath94 follow the classical uniform circular motion on a sphere . in view of ( 19 ) for @xmath116 and @xmath117 utilized in the case of the free evolution , where @xmath91 is a classical position marking the coherent state , the motion takes place in the equator .",
    "bearing in mind the behavior at @xmath99 analyzed in the case of the free evolution we now discuss the probability density for the coordinates corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath113 . from ( 20 ) and ( 31 ) it follows that the probability density is @xmath118 where @xmath110 is given by ( 32 ) with @xmath112 . the probability density ( 36 ) is periodic function of time with period @xmath119 . in opposition to ( 26 ) it shows maximum and has no saddle points .    in summary , the rigid rotor in the coherent state shows unusual behavior that can be interpreted as quantum beats .",
    "it seems plausible to relate these beats to quantum interference . however , the concrete scenario is not clear .",
    "an intriguing point is the correlation of behavior of the rigid rotor with saddle points of the probability density .",
    "the authors do not know any example of analogous relationship in the literature .",
