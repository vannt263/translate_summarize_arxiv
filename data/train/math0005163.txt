    "the graph of @xmath117 on @xmath120 is the the graph of @xmath105 .",
    "we see that the whole job of deforming @xmath45 to the graph of a piecewise linear convex function can be done by the maslov dequantization : the deformation consists of the graphs of the same polynomial @xmath113 on @xmath119 for @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "the coefficients @xmath122 of this polynomial are logarithms of the coefficients of the original polynomial : @xmath123 .",
    "since the map @xmath124 was denoted above by @xmath125 , we denote by @xmath126 the polynomial obtained from a polynomial @xmath127 with positive coefficients by replacing its coefficients with their logarithms .",

    "( i believe the subject of algebraic geometry would be better described by the name of _ polynomial geometry_. ) since a polynomial over @xmath91 is presented so explicitly as a quantization of a piecewise linear convex function , one may expect to find along this line explicit relations between other objects and phenomena of algebraic geometry over @xmath91 and piecewise linear geometry . indeed , in piecewise",
    "linear geometry the notion of piecewise linear convex function plays almost the same rle as the notion of polynomial in algebraic geometry .    a representation of real algebraic geometry as a quantized pl - geometry may be rewarding in many ways .",
    "for example , in any quantization there are _ classical objects _ ,",
    "i.e. , objects which do not change much under the quantization .",
    "objects of pl - geometry are easier to construct .",
    "if we knew conditions under which a pl object gives rise to a real algebraic object , which is classical with respect to the maslov quantization , then we would have a simple way to construct real algebraic objects with controlled properties .",
    "above in section [ s1 ] we discussed the drawing of graphs on a logarithmic paper only for a polynomial with positive coefficients .",
    "the graphs allowed us to see the behavior of the polynomials only at positive values of the argument .",
    "this was for a good reason : we used logarithms of coordinates .",
    "the maslov dequantization deals only with positive numbers .",
    "therefore each fragment of algebraic geometry that we want to dequantize must be reformulated first only in terms of positive numbers .",
    "this seems to be possible for everything belonging to real algebraic geometry .      above",
    "we could not encounter roots of polynomials , for a polynomial with _ positive _ coefficients has no _ positive _ roots .",
    "however if we really want to do algebraic geometry on log paper , we must figure out how to use graphs on log paper for visualizing roots ( well , only _ positive _ roots ) of an arbitrary real polynomial .",
    "any real polynomial @xmath134 is a difference @xmath135 of polynomials with positive coefficients .",
    "we can reformulate the problem of finding the positive roots of @xmath41 as the problem of finding positive values of @xmath0 at which @xmath136 .",
    "the graphs of @xmath137 and @xmath138 can be drawn on a log paper , where they are localized in the strips along broken lines , see section [ s1.5 ] above . for some polynomials",
    "this picture gives a decent information on the number and position of the positive roots .",
    "the negative roots of @xmath134 can be treated in the same way , since their absolute values are the positive roots of @xmath139 .",
    "now consider a real polynomial @xmath140 in two variables .",
    "similarly to the case of polynomials in one variable , in the _ logarithmic space _ the graph of a monomial @xmath141 with @xmath142 is a plane @xmath143 , and the graph @xmath45 of a polynomial @xmath144 with positive coefficients lies in a neighborhood of a convex piecewise linear surface , which is the graph @xmath47 of the maximum @xmath145 of the monomials .",
    "furthermore , @xmath41 is included into a dequantizing family @xmath130 defined as @xmath146 for @xmath95 , cf .",
    "section [ s2.2 ] .",
    "the graph @xmath83 of @xmath130 in the logarithmic space with scaled coordinates @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath147 coincides with the graph of the polynomial @xmath148 in @xmath149 . these graphs with @xmath150 $ ] constitute a continuous deformation of @xmath151 to @xmath47 .    for a polynomial @xmath41 in two variables with arbitrary real coefficients , denote by @xmath137 the sum of its monomials with positive coefficients , and put @xmath152 .",
    "thus @xmath41 is canonically presented as a difference @xmath153 of two polynomials with positive coefficients . to obtain the curve defined on logarithmic paper by the equation @xmath154",
    ", one can construct the graphs @xmath155 and @xmath156 for @xmath137 and @xmath138 in the logarithmic space , which are the surfaces defined in the usual cartesian coordinates by @xmath157 , and project the intersection @xmath158 to the plane of arguments .",
    "for the first approximation of this curve , one may take the broken line , which is the projection of the intersection of the piecewise linear surfaces @xmath159 and @xmath160 corresponding to @xmath137 and @xmath138 .    of course",
    ", it may well happen that the broken line does not even resemble the curve .",
    "this happens to first approximations .",
    "however , it is very appealing to figure out circumstances under which the broken line is a good approximation , for a broken line seems to be much easier to deal with than an algebraic curve .",
    "recall that in the logarithmic space the graph of @xmath141 is a plane @xmath143 .",
    "it has a normal vector @xmath161 and intersects the vertical axis at @xmath162 .",
    "thus if we want to construct a curve of a given degree @xmath163 , we have to arrange planes whose normals are fixed : they are @xmath161 with integers @xmath164 , satisfying inequalities @xmath165 .",
    "the only freedom is in moving them up and down .",
    "consider the pieces of these planes which do not lie under the others .",
    "they form a convex piecewise linear surface @xmath166 , the graph of the maximum of the linear forms defining our planes .",
    "the combinatorial structure of faces in @xmath166 depends on the arrangement .",
    "assume that at each vertex of @xmath166 exactly three of the planes meet .",
    "this is a genericity condition , which can be satisfied by small shifts of the planes .",
    "divide now the faces of @xmath166 arbitrarily into two classes .",
    "denote the union of one of them by @xmath167 , the union of the other by @xmath168 . by genericity of the configuration , the common boundary of @xmath167 and @xmath168 is union of disjoint polygonal simple closed curves .",
    "it can be easily realized as the intersection of pl - surfaces @xmath169 and @xmath170 as above : take for @xmath171 with @xmath172 the sum of monomials corresponding to the planes of faces forming @xmath173 and put @xmath174 .",
    "consider now for @xmath175 the curve @xmath176 which is the intersection of the graphs in @xmath149 of the polynomials @xmath177 and @xmath178 . at @xmath179",
    "this is the intersection of the convex pl - surfaces @xmath159 , @xmath160 . due to the genericity condition above",
    ", this intersection is as transversal as one could wish : at all but a finite number of points the interior part of a face of one of them meets the interior part of a face of the other one , and at the rest of the points an edge of one of the surfaces intersects transversaly the interior of a face of the other surface .",
    "when @xmath65 gets positive , the graphs are smoothed , their corners are rounded off .",
    "the same happens to their intersection curve . while the graphs are transveral , the intersection curve is deformed isotopically .",
    "take the curve corresponding to a value of @xmath65 such that the transversality is preserved between 0 and this value .",
    "the projection to @xmath180-plane of @xmath181 represents an algebraic curve of degree @xmath163 on the scaled logarithmic paper and it can be obtained by a small isotopy of the projection of @xmath182 to the @xmath180-plane .      a construction , which looks similar , has been known in the topology of real algebraic varieties for about 20 years as _ patchworking , _ or _",
