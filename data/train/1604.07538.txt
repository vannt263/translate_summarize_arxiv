    "jan oort  @xcite based his historic hypothesis on the existence of a distant , spherical cloud of cometary bodies surrounding the solar system on the original @xmath1-distribution of nineteen near - parabolic comets with the best - determined ( at that time ) original orbits .",
    "comet c/1890",
    "f1 brooks belonged to this group .",
    "it is distinguished by a long and rich series of observations : almost 2yr period covered by about 900  positional measurements .",
    "a question of the distribution of the reciprocal original semimajor axes @xmath2 is frequently repeated in the literature not only to support the oort cloud ( oc ) hypothesis , but also to examine the density distribution of the oc , recognized as a reservoir of the cometary bodies that can potentially penetrate into the planetary system @xcite .",
    "however , it was already established @xcite , that a significant fraction of investigated comets with the original @xmath1 within the so - called oort spike , @xmath3au@xmath4 , passed through the inner part of the solar system in their previous perihelion passage . therefore , the interpretation of the original @xmath1-distribution of the near - parabolic comets should be treated with caution . in particular",
    ", one should take into consideration that a vast majority of comets from the oort spike suffered planetary perturbations that have changed significantly their semimajor axes during each deep passage through planetary zone . here",
    "we focus our investigation on the dynamical history of oort spike comets in the period extending back to their previous perihelion passage .",
    "it is the only direct method that allows us to separate the dynamically new comets of the oort spike from the dynamically old ones .",
    "typical planetary perturbations defined by a change of @xmath1 during the passage within the inner part of the solar system are typically two to four times greater than the present estimate of the oort spike width . in consequence , after visiting the inner planetary system , a comet has an excessive chance to be outside the oort spike , leaving the solar system on a hyperbolic orbit , or moving on a significantly tighter orbit than previously .",
    "since many comets discovered so far will escape from the solar system in the future , we also investigate their future evolution which gives a much broader perspective on the dynamical evolution of comets discovered as oort spike comets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper 5 and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to the above general arguments , there are also some specific objectives of the present investigation .",
    "we chose comet c/1890",
    "f1  brooks not only for its historic importance but also to develop and test our methods of data treatment for such a long - ago discovered comet . in the case of c/1890",
    "f1 , we have an opportunity to repeat the reduction of astrometric observations using contemporary star catalogues , typically much more precise , particularly in terms of proper motions .",
    "the (    @xmath5)-measurementsstar)-measurements ] ( @xmath6 in right ascension and @xmath7 in declination ) are fortunately published in original papers together with calculated apparent comet positions for almost all observations of this comet . apart from seven transit circle observations made in washington the only sources without explicit (    @xmath5)-differences are original papers reporting 99  observations from bordeaux observatory ( only one paper with five observations from bordeaux listed also (    @xmath5)-measurements )",
    ". fortunately , these publications also consist of both , reference star identifications and their apparent places used for the reduction .",
    "thereby , the reconstruction of the (    @xmath5)-measurements is quite straightforward .",
    "for all these reasons , we also decided to show in this paper how the determination of the observed osculating orbitdepends on the adopted method of data processing ( how deep we are looking for sources of errors in the published data ) and our choice of the catalogue for reference star positions .",
    "two methods and two catalogues have been used for this purpose : ppm star catalogue @xcite and tycho-2 star catalogue @xcite .",
    "the first , fully automatic , method is very useful in cases in which we have at hand a list of astrometric cometary positions together with (    @xmath5)-measurements in right - ascension and declination , and we had not entered data on the reference stars originally used by observers .",
    "it involves the reconstruction of hypothetical star positions on the basis of (    @xmath5)-measurements , and published cometary positions if they were given by observers .",
    "otherwise , the cometary positions are estimated from preliminary orbital elements .",
    "next , the re - reduction of these stars positions using ppm catalogue is carried out . finally , the positions of comets are calculated based on obtained present - day star positions and original (    @xmath5)-measurements . of course",
    ", it can also be applied to a star catalogue other than ppm , but here the ppm catalogue is used for a comparison purpose .",
    "this method was successfully used for many comets discovered long ago ( @xcite and @xcite ) , thus it is only very briefly described in section  [ stars_in_ppm ] .    in this investigation however , all the data originally published by observers were collected .",
    "therefore , a much more in - depth analysis of the original data can be done and the second method described in this paper is devoted to such an investigation .",
    "the tycho-2 catalogue is chosen as it is perceived to be one of the best modern catalogues for this purpose , particularly regarding proper motions . in the first step , we collected a list of mean coordinates of all reference stars used by all observers and then their contemporary astrometric data were automatically obtained . next , we calculated astrometric positions of the comet using (    @xmath5)-measurements .",
    "finally , manual and time consuming part was to investigate the causes of large residuals obtained from this automated step for about 30  per cent of all observations .",
    "about half of them resulted from the wrong star identifications and the rest came from some inconsistency or typographical errors in papers published by observers . more details about this second method are given in section  [ section : stars_in_tycho-2 ] .",
    "the paper consists of seven sections .",
    "next section describes the observational material and previous orbital determinations of c/1890  f1  brooks that exist in literature . in section  [ section : star_recalculation ] details of the method of reference star position recalculation using the procedures based on ppm and tycho-2 star catalogues are given , and a brief description of further steps of our data treatment is delivered .",
    "a grid of osculating orbits based on both methods of reference star recalculations is described in section  [ section : our_osculating_orbits ] , where also the analysis of differences between these results is presented .",
    "the original and future orbits are discussed in section  [ section : original_future_orbits ] .",
    "the final result of this study , the most important from the dynamical point of view , is presented in section  [ section : past_next_orbits ] , where we discuss what can be deduced about the origin of comet c/1890",
    "f1  brooks and its future dynamical evolution . the summary and conclusions resulting from this research are outlined in the last section .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,^ \" , ]",
    "many interesting aspects of the past and future orbit evolution of c/1890  f1 under stellar and galactic perturbations can be found in fig.[fig : nominal - c/1890f1-orbit ] . in this picture",
    "the horizontal time axis extends from the previous perihelion passage through the observed apparition up to the next perihelion passage .",
    "the left vertical axis is expressed in au and describes the osculating perihelion distance evolution ( q , green line ) , as well as the heliocentric distance plot ( @xmath8 , thin blue lines ) . due to the time scale of this picture ,",
    "the heliocentric distance plots take a form of vertical blue lines exactly at perihelion passage moments .",
    "the right vertical axis is expressed in degrees and describes changes in the osculating inclination ( @xmath9 , magenta line ) and in the argument of perihelion ( @xmath10 , red line ) .",
    "both of these angular elements are expressed in the galactic frame .",
    "all thick lines depict dynamical evolution under joint stellar and galactic perturbations , while the thin lines mark the evolution with the stellar perturbations excluded .",
    "horizontal dashed lines draw attention to the beginning of the second and fourth quarter of @xmath10 , whose values ( 90and 270 ) are important from the point of view of the galactic perturbations ( crossing these lines coincides with perihelion distance minimum ) .",
    "the vertical dashed lines show the closest approaches of a comet with the star or stellar system , which name is placed at the top of the picture .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the timing of the stellar perturbation is not necessarily strictly aligned with this closest approach moment  it strongly depends on the geometry , since the final heliocentric orbit change is a net effect of a stellar gravitational action on both a comet and the sun .",
    "the action of gj 217.1 is a good example of a frequent self - cancelling stellar action : the perturbation gained during the approaching phase is then cancelled during the receding phase . during the presented 3.5myr interval of cometary evolution ,",
    "the galactic and stellar perturbations are notable only in the perihelion distance , while being infinitesimally small in angular elements .",
    "we have not identified any profound stellar perturbation in future motion of c/1890f1 since it will depart from the sun for only about 20000au and it will complete its future orbital revolution ( 1.1myr ) about 0.3myr before the predicted close flyby of the star gliese  710 .",
    "other stars are too small and/or too distant to noticeably change the future orbit of this comet .     and @xmath11 of 5001 vcs derived from the nominal orbit of the preferred solution for c/1890  f1 , stopped at their previous perihelion passage .",
    "the centre of the green circle marks the nominal values .",
    "small green dots overprinted on the marginal distributions show best - fitting gaussian distributions . ]     and [ tab : previous_and_next ] for more details ) .",
    "all known stellar and galactic perturbations were taken into account .",
    "black lines depict nominal orbits evolution .",
    "distributions of previous and next perihelia epochs are also shown . ]",
    "c/1890  f1 is definitely the dynamically old comet .",
    "even the most protruding clones in our swarm of vcs have the previous perihelion distance well below 10au . the osculating perihelion distance and the inverse semimajor axis distributions of c/1890  f1 for the moment of the previous perihelion passage ( nominally 2.5myr ago )",
    "are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : joint - and - marginal ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the presented @xmath1-distribution is still almost perfectly gaussian while the @xmath11-distribution significantly departs from the normal one , mainly as a result of galactic perturbations . the central , black joined distribution corresponds to the smaller cloud of 5001vcs presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : original_swarms_dataii ] after the 1.73.8myr of backward dynamical evolution under the simultaneous galactic and stellar action ( different vcs have different orbital periods , a nominal value equals 2.5myr , the fastest vc was at the previous perihelion 1.7myr ago while the slowest one almost 3.8myr ago ) .    the time - spread ( along horizontal axis ) and the space - spread ( along vertical axis ) of our swarms of vcs in previous and next perihelion",
    "are clearly visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fontanny ] .",
    "we presented here changes in the barycentric distance of all 5001 vcs from two different solutions of orbit determination , both based on the data_iib set of observations .",
    "the red ( darker ) swarm depicts the distribution evolving from the osculating orbit fitted to the weighted observations ( a5-solution ) while the green ( grey ) one depicts the evolution of swarm constructed without weighting ( a1-solution ) .",
    "nominal orbits for both of our solutions are marked as black curves .",
    "thus , this figure shows also how the data handling can change the results during the evolution to the previous / next perihelion distance ( see also table  [ tab : previous_and_next ] ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of strmgren s orbit would be very similar to the evolution of our a1 orbital solution .",
    "we conclude that our preferred a5-solution gives longer previous and next orbital periods of about 2.5 and 1.1myr respectively . as a result ,",
    "galactic perturbations act more effective during the evolution , and for this solution we get a greater change of the perihelion distances between three consecutive perihelion passages analysed here .",
    "a rich observational material of c/1890  f1 brooks allows to test whether it is productive to recalculate with the use of modern star catalogues the original positions of comets discovered long ago . during this study we compared two distinct algorithms :    * automatic search for reference stars in the ppm star catalogue according to @xcite , which was frequently used by us when we only have ( + @xmath5)-measurements and data on the positions of comets , * automatic search for reference stars in the tycho-2 star catalogue on the basis of mean coordinates of reference stars used by all observers , and next , a detailed analysis of all the cases of large residuals in the observed comet s positions , resulting from the star search ( @xmath1230  per cent of all observations in the case of c/1890  f1 ) .    the first method was successfully used several times before , and more recently by @xcite .",
    "this method of automatic search for stars in ppm catalogue recalculates about 50  per cent of the existing data of c/1890  f1 .",
    "the second method was developed for the present investigation . in the simbad database",
    "we have successfully found all stars used by observers more than hundred years ago to calculate the comet s position in @xmath13 and/or @xmath14 from (    @xmath5)-measurements .",
    "it means , that all positions of c/1890f1 were recalculated here using these original (    @xmath5)-measurements ( @xmath6 and/or @xmath7 ) .",
    "we decided to use stellar positions and proper motions from the tycho-2 catalogue for that purpose .",
    "it should be emphasized that thanks to the monumental publication by elis @xcite , our task has become much easier , though , it was still time consuming . searching for stars in the simbad database would be more difficult without the mentioned publication , particularly in the more complicated cases .",
    "in addition , thanks to strmgren s deep analysis of data , it turned out that one should take into account corrections to @xmath7 measurements from bordeaux observatory ( we prefer linear version of these corrections as described in section  [ section : stars_in_tycho-2 ] ) .",
    "however , these corrections change the orbital solution on the significantly lower level than the use of modern stellar data . for example , a solution based on data recalculated in about 50  per cent ( ppm catalogue , data_ia / data_ib ) differs a lot from the respective solution based on fully recalculated data ( tycho-2 catalogue data_iia / data_iib ) than any two solutions based on data with and without bordeaux corrections .",
    "moreover , the bordeaux corrections are also much less important than the method of data treatment .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : original_axes_all_models ] , where we can see that light - green histogram ( weighted data , corrections for bordeaux omitted ) is very similar to dark - green histogram ( weighted data , corrections for bordeaux applied ) , however , it differs significantly from the pair of yellow / orange histograms based on unweighted data .",
    "next , we have shown that both search algorithms for contemporary data for the reference stars resulted in a significant reduction of the uncertainties of orbital elements in the case of c/1890  f1 brooks .",
    "the comparison of our solutions with that derived by strmgren is presented in table  [ tab : orbits_osculating ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : osculating_swarms_dataiib ] . by analysing all these models",
    ", we concluded that the orbital solution based on data_iib ( all positional observations were recalculated using tycho-2 catalogue and next weighted ) gives the most reliable , and also the most accurate osculating orbit .",
    "using this most preferred orbital solution ( and its unweighted variant for comparison , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fontanny ] ) we numerically followed a motion of c/1890  f1 for one orbital period to the past and to the future . starting from full swarms of original and future vcs orbits we obtained previous and next orbital elements of this comet together with their uncertainties .",
    "all known stellar and galactic perturbations were fully taken into account but for comparison purposes we have also performed the calculations in which stellar perturbations were ignored .",
    "this comparison ( see table [ tab : previous_and_next ] for details ) shows that none of known stellar perturbers significantly change the past and future motion of c/1890  f1 during the three successive perihelion passages analysed here .",
    "it should be stressed that due to relatively short past orbital period of c/1890f1 brooks ( nominally 2.5myr ) it seems rather improbable that we have missed here some unknown but significant ( i.e. massive and/or slow moving ) and nearby stellar perturber .",
    "three consecutive perihelion passages of this comet ( the time interval of about 3.6myr ) clearly indicate that this comet deeply penetrates the planetary region during each of them ( below 5au from the sun , see table  [ tab : previous_and_next ] ) and easily crosses the so - called jupiter - saturn barrier .",
    "therefore , we conclude that c/1890  f1 brooks is a dynamically old comet and additionally , as a result of negligible planetary perturbations during the observed apparition , it will remain a member of the oort spike during the next apparition .",
    "note that @xcite treated this comet ( by definition ) as a dynamically new one and used it in support for his cometary cloud hypothesis .",
    "currently , on the basis of analysis of 109  oort spike comets , we estimate that about 50  per cent of them are dynamically old .",
    "however , the percentage of dynamically old comets grows up to almost 90 for comets with @xmath2 inside the range of 0.0000400.000100au@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "thus , the past dynamical evolution of comet brooks having @xmath2 greater than @xmath15au@xmath4 is not surprising . on the other hand , for the reason of very weak planetary perturbations one can say that the dynamical behaviour of c/1890  f1 is unusual among small perihelion comets .    in the near future ,",
    "we plan to deal with all near - parabolic comets discussed by @xcite as well as all oort spike comets discovered in the years 19011950 to answer the question about their source from the previous perihelion perspective , and make our sample of near - parabolic comets with known previous and next orbital elements more complete .",
    "it can also happen that some comets observed on a more tightly bound orbit ( @xmath16au@xmath4 ) will contribute to a future @xmath1-distribution as oort spike comets .",
    "therefore the extension of our research to objects with @xmath1 similar to that shared by c/2013 v2 borisov ( @xmath17au@xmath4and @xmath18au@xmath4 , @xcite ) seems to be important to put our investigation in the broader framework of dynamical evolution of long - period comets .",
