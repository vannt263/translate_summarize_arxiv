    "let @xmath5 , @xmath6 be two general quadratic forms in @xmath7 variables over @xmath8 . a well known theorem , which goes back to jacobi and weierstrass",
    ", says that @xmath5 , @xmath6 can be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "more precisely there exist linear forms @xmath9 and scalars @xmath10 such that @xmath11 an important feature is that the forms @xmath12 are unique ( up to order ) and their equivalence class , up to multiple scalars , depend only on the pencil @xmath13 , hence also @xmath14 are uniquely determined after @xmath5 , @xmath6 have been chosen in this order .",
    "the canonical form ( [ eq:2quadrics ] ) allows to write easily the basic invariants of the pencil , like the discriminant which takes the form @xmath15 .",
    "we call ( [ eq:2quadrics ] ) a ( simultaneous ) waring decomposition of the pair @xmath2",
    ". the pencil @xmath16 has a unique waring decomposition with @xmath7 summands if and only if its discriminant does not vanish . in the tensor terminology",
    ", @xmath2 is _ generically identifiable_.    we generalize now the decomposition ( [ eq:2quadrics ] ) to @xmath17 general forms , even allowing different degrees . for symmetry reasons ,",
    "it is convenient not to distinguish @xmath5 from the other @xmath18 s , so we will allow scalars @xmath19 to the decomposition of each @xmath18 , including @xmath5 . to be precise , let @xmath20 be a vector of general homogeneous forms of degree @xmath21 in @xmath7 variables over the complex field @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 for all @xmath24 .",
    "let assume that @xmath25 .",
    "[ simdec ] a _ waring decomposition _ of @xmath20 is given by linear forms @xmath26 and scalars @xmath27 with @xmath28 such that @xmath29 for all @xmath28 or in vector notation @xmath30    the geometric argument in  [ subsec : projbundle ] shows that every @xmath31 has a waring decomposition .",
    "we consider two waring decompositions of @xmath31 as in ( [ eq : simwaring ] ) being equal if they differ just by the order of the @xmath32 summands .",
    "the _ rank _ of @xmath31 is the minimum number @xmath32 of summands appearing in ( [ eq : simwaring ] ) , this definition coincides with the classical one in the case @xmath33 ( the vector @xmath31 given by a single polynomial ) .    due to the presence of the scalars @xmath19 , each form @xmath34 depends essentially only on @xmath35 conditions .",
    "so the decomposition ( [ eq : dec ] ) may be thought as a nonlinear system with @xmath36 data ( given by @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 unknowns ( given by @xmath39 scalars @xmath19 and @xmath32 forms @xmath34 ) .",
    "this is a very classical subject , see for example @xcite , although in most of classical papers the degrees @xmath40 were assumed equal , with the notable exception of @xcite .",
    "[ d : perfectcases ] let @xmath41 be as above .",
    "the space @xmath42 is called _ perfect _ if there exists @xmath32 such that @xmath43 i.e. when ( [ eq : dec ] ) corresponds to a square polynomial system .",
    "the arithmetic condition ( [ eq : perfect ] ) means that @xmath36 is divisible by @xmath44 , in other terms the number of summands @xmath32 in the system ( [ eq : dec ] ) is uniquely determined .",
    "the case with two quadratic forms described in ( [ eq:2quadrics ] ) corresponds to @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and it is perfect .",
    "the perfect cases are important because , by the above dimensional count , we expect finitely many waring decompositions for the generic polynomial vector in a perfect space @xmath42",
    ".    it may happen that general elements in perfect spaces have no decompositions with the expected number @xmath32 of summands , the first example , beside the one of plane conics , was found by clebsch in the xixth century and regards ternary quartics , where @xmath33 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : perfect ] ) gives @xmath50 but in this case the system ( [ eq : dec ] ) has no solutions and indeed @xmath51 summands are needed to find a waring decomposition of the general ternary quartic .",
    "it is well known that all the perfect cases with @xmath33 when the system ( [ eq : dec ] ) has no solutions have been determined by alexander and hirschowitz , while more cases for @xmath52 have been found in @xcite , where a collection of classical and modern interesting examples is listed .",
    "still , perfectness is a necessary condition to have finitely many waring decompositions .",
    "so two natural questions , of increasing difficulty , arise .",
    "0.4 cm * question 1 * are there other perfect cases for @xmath53 , beyond ( [ eq:2quadrics ] ) , where a unique waring decomposition ( [ eq : simwaring ] ) exists for generic @xmath31 , namely where we have generic identifiability ?",
    "0.4 cm * question 2 * compute the number of waring decompositions ( up to order of summands ) for a generic @xmath31 in any perfect case .",
    "0.4 cm the above two questions are probably quite difficult , but we feel it is worth to state them as guiding problems .",
    "these two questions are open even in the case @xmath33 of a single polynomial . in case @xmath33 ,",
    "question 1 has a conjectural answer due to the third author , who proved many cases of this conjecture in @xcite .",
    "the birational technique used in these papers has been generalized to our setting in  [ sec : ternary ] of this paper .",
    "always in case @xmath33 , some number of decompositions for small @xmath54 and @xmath35 have been computed ( with high probability ) in @xcite by homotopy continuation techniques , with the numerical software bertini @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we contribute to the above two questions . before stating our conclusions",
    ", we still need to expose other known results on this topic .    in the case",
    "@xmath55 ( binary forms ) there is a result by ciliberto and russo @xcite which completely answers our question 1 .",
    "[ thm : binforms0 ] let @xmath55 . in all the perfect cases",

    "we will provide alternative proofs to theorem [ thm : binforms0 ] by using apolarity , see theorem [ thm : nonabelian_applied2 ] .    as widely expected , for @xmath59 generic identifiability is quite a rare phenomenon .",
    "they have been extensively investigated in the xix@xmath60 century and at the beginning of the xx@xmath60 century and the following are the only discovered cases that we are aware : @xmath61    the interest in waring decompositions was revived by mukai s work on 3-folds , @xcite@xcite .",
    "since then many authors devoted their energies to understand , interpret and expand the theory .",
    "cases @xmath62 and @xmath63 in ( [ eq : classiclist ] ) were explained by ranestad and schreyer in @xcite by using syzygies , see also @xcite for an approach via projective geometry and @xcite for a vector bundle approach ( called in this paper `` nonabelian apolarity '' , see  [ sec : nonabelian ] ) .",

    "@xmath65 is a classical and `` easy '' result , there is a unique waring decomposition of a general 4-tuple of ternary quadrics .",
    "there is a very nice geometric interpretation for this latter case .",
    "four points in @xmath66 define a @xmath67 that cuts the veronese surface in 4 points giving the required unique decomposition .",
    "see remark [ rem : d^n ] for a generalization to arbitrary @xmath68 .",
    "our main contribution with respect to unique decompositions is the following new case .",
    "[ thm : main334 ] a general @xmath69 has a unique waring decomposition of rank 7 , namely it is identifiable .",
    "the theorem will be proved in the general setting of theorem [ thm : nonabelian_applied2 ] . beside the new example",

    "we adapted the methods in @xcite to our setting , by using the software bertini @xcite and also the package _ numerical algebraic geometry _",
    "@xcite in macaulay2 @xcite , with the generous help by jon hauenstein and anton leykin , who assisted us in writing our first scripts .",
    "the computational analysis of perfect cases of forms on @xmath70 suggested that for @xmath71 the waring decomposition is unique .",
    "then we proved it via nonabelian apolarity with the choice of a vector bundle .",
    "another novelty of this paper is a unified proof of almost all cases with a unique waring decomposition via nonabelian apolarity with the choice of a vector bundle @xmath72 , see theorem [ thm : nonabelian_applied2 ] .",
    "finally we borrowed a construction from @xcite to prove , see theorem [ thm : unirat ] , that whenever we have uniqueness for rank @xmath32 then the variety parametrizing waring decompositions of higher rank is unirational .",
    "pick @xmath45 and @xmath49 , the space @xmath73 is perfect if and only if @xmath74 is even .",
    "all the numerical computations we did suggested that identifiability holds only for @xmath4 ( by robert s theorem , see ( [ eq : classiclist ] ) @xmath64 ) .",
    "once again this pushed us to prove the non - uniqueness for these pencils of plane curves .",
