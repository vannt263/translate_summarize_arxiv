    "as an interesting research issue , experimental studies of the hadronic transitions of @xmath22 have been focused on by the belle collaboration in the past decade .",
    "when surveying the reported hadronic transitions of @xmath22 , we found their general property , i.e. , their observed hadronic transitions have large branching ratios .",
    "for example , belle observed anomalous decay widths of the @xmath23 @xcite , and @xmath24 transitions @xcite .",
    "in addition , two bottomonium - like states @xmath25 and @xmath26 were observed in @xmath23 @xcite . as indicated in a serial of theoretical studies @xcite",
    ", the puzzling phenomena happening on @xmath22 transitions reflect an underlying mechanism mediated by a coupled channel effect since @xmath22 is above the thresholds of @xmath27 @xcite .    in the bottomonium family",
    ", the @xmath28 has the similar situation to that of @xmath22 .",
    "we have a reason to believe that the coupled channel effect is still important to the hadronic transitions of @xmath28 , whose exploration is , thus , an intriguing topic .",
    "this theme can provide us a valuable information of the coupled - channel effect on these decays .    in this work , we calculate the @xmath14 ( @xmath29 ) along with @xmath18 ( @xmath29 ) processes via the hadronic loop mechanism , which is an equivalent description of the coupled channel effect @xcite . by analyzing these transitions ,",
    "the relative decay rates of @xmath14 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath29 ) , which are a typical physical quantity given by our calculation , are determined . especially , our results show that these relative decay rates are weakly dependent on the model parameters .",
    "thus , experimental measurement of these rates can be a crucial test of the hadronic loop mechanism in the @xmath14 and @xmath18 decays .",
    "in addition , we also estimate the typical values of the branching ratios of @xmath14 and @xmath18 , which can be measured experimentally in near future .",
    "anyway , we would like to inspire experimenlists interest in searching for the @xmath14 and @xmath18 decays by our results presented in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after introduction , we present the detailed calculation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 via the hadronic loop mechanism in sec .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary .",
    "under the hadronic loop mechanism , the @xmath32 transitions occur via the triangle loops composed of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which play a role of the bridge to connect the initial state @xmath28 and final states @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in figs .",
    "[ fig:6s - phi - chib0]-[fig:6s - phi - chib2 ] , we list the typical diagrams depicting the @xmath38 transitions . for",
    "the @xmath33 transitions , due to very different quark contents between @xmath36 and @xmath39 , the bridges change to @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the diagrams change simultaneously as in figs .",
    "[ fig:6s - omega - chib0]-[fig:6s - omega - chib2 ] .      for the interactions between a heavy quarkonium and two heavy - light mesons ,",
    "the lagrangians are constructed based on the heavy quark effective theory . in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "the light degrees of freedom @xmath42 is a good quantum number .",
    "thus , each value of @xmath42 is assigned to a doublet formed by the states with a total angular momentum @xmath43 , while for the heavy quarkonium , since the degeneracy is expected under the rotations of two heavy quark spins , there is a multiplet formed by heavy quarkonia with the same angular momentum @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , under the framework of heavy quark symmetry , general forms of couplings between an s - wave or p - wave heavy quarkonium and two heavy - light mesons can be constructed as @xcite @xmath45 + h.c .",
