    "the optical flux density of the two eastern knots of ( @xmath9)@xmath10jy exceeds the power - law extrapolation from the radio to the x - ray regime by almost three orders of magnitude ruling out synchrotron emission as a possible mechanism .",
    "the above data provide circumstantial evidence that shocks are implicated in the production of the jet - associated x - ray emission , produced as a result of the dissipation of some fraction of the jets kinetic power in jet - cloud collisions . given a 1.4ghz flux density of 0.15jy of both radio lobes , the corresponding radio luminosity is @xmath11ergs@xmath2hz@xmath2 .",
    "using the expressions given in @xcite the kinetic power in both jets is @xmath12 , where @xmath13hz@xmath2 is the ratio of monochromatic radio power to kinetic power .",

    "the 0.38kev x - ray luminosity associated with the jets is @xmath15ergs@xmath2 , i.e. , approximately 2.5% of the estimated jet energy flux .",
    "this is expected since shocks driven into dense clouds by a light jet only tap a small fraction of the jet power .",
    "the energy flux into the shock is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the shock velocity and the numerical factor @xmath18 depends upon the jet mach number , @xmath19 , and the deflection angle , @xmath20 , but is mainly sensitive to the latter .",
    "it is approximately 0.2 for a @xmath21 deflection and 1 for a head - on collision .",
    "the immediate post - shock temperature is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the proton mass and @xmath10 is the mean molecular weight of the shocked particles , so that 0.5kev corresponds to a shock velocity , @xmath24kms@xmath2 . in a radiative shock , approximately half of the energy flux into the shock is radiated in the hot continuum so that the expected x - ray luminosity is @xmath25ergs@xmath2 .",
    "this estimate is compatible to the observed value for a mildly relativistic jet with @xmath26 ( see vermeulen et al .",
