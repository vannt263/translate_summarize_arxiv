    "the interplay between spin and charge transport in nonmagnetic metal / ferromagnetic insulator ( nm / fmi ) hybrids gives rise to various interesting phenomena , such as spin injection  @xcite , spin pumping  @xcite , and spin seebeck  @xcite .",
    "the previous investigations on nm / fmi hybrids , e.g. , pt / y@xmath0fe@xmath6o@xmath7 , pt / cofe@xmath8o@xmath9 , pd / y@xmath0fe@xmath6o@xmath7 , and ta / y@xmath0fe@xmath6o@xmath7 , demonstrated a new - type of magnetoresistance ( mr )  @xcite in which the resistivity of the film , @xmath3 , has an unconventional angular dependence , namely , @xmath10",
    "^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are unit vectors in the directions of the magnetization and the current , respectively , and @xmath13 represents the normal vector perpendicular to the plane of the layers .",
    "the above unusual angular dependent resistivity differs from the conventional magnetoresistance ( cmr ) in which @xmath14 , and thus several theoretical models have been developed to explain the effect .",
    "one of the most successful models is spin hall magnetoresistance ( smr ) which is built on the spin hall and inverse spin hall effects  @xcite : an electric current ( @xmath15 ) induces a spin current @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the spin hall angle and @xmath18 is the spin of the conduction electron .",
    "such induced spin current in turn generates an electric current whose direction is opposite to the original @xmath15 , and thus the spin hall and inverse spin hall effects increase the resistivity by a factor of @xmath19 . however , in the case of a thin film in contact with a magnetic insulator , the spin current may be either reflected back , which would reduce the spin current in the film , or absorbed via spin transfer torques , which would preserve the spin current in the film  @xcite .",
    "the reflection is strongest when the magnetization direction of the insulator is parallel to the spin current , therefore the spin current is least when @xmath11 is parallel to @xmath20 , leading to the minimum resistivity as described in eq .",
    "another model is based on the spin - dependent scattering and rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc )  @xcite .",
    "when the electron scatters off the magnetic interface , the resistivity for spin up and down relative to the direction of the magnetization is different . in the presence of interface rashba spin - orbit interaction , two spin channels",
    "are mixed and an additional resistance appears .",
    "it has been found that such mechanism also gives rise to an unconventional magnetoresitance ( ucmr ) and an extraordinary hall resistance ( ehr )  @xcite .",

    "the ehr has shown rich characteristics such as unusual temperature dependence of hall conductivity whose magnitude and sign are highly non - trivial  @xcite .",
    "if one were to apply the smr model , one would have to use an unphysical imaginary part of the spin mixing conductance parameter .",
    "in particular , it requires an arbitrary temperature dependent mixing parameter to qualitatively fit the ehr data .",

    "in contrast to the yig film , which exhibits extreme high curie temperature ( @xmath23 540 k )  @xcite , it is much easier to investigate the difference of spin transport properties between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states in lco - based hybrids .",

    "for all three scans , the magnitude @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath4 monotonically decreases as increasing the pt thickness , which is different from the case of pt / yig , where the @xmath2@xmath3/@xmath4 shows a maximum around t@xmath31 @xmath90 @xmath91 ( @xmath91 is spin diffusion of pt )  @xcite . for t@xmath31 @xmath73 10 nm , there is no measurable oscillation for all three field scans .",
    "based on the above experimental data , we conclude that the observed extraordinary hall resistance and unconventional magnetoresistance in pt thin films are entangled with the ferromagnetism of lco insulator .",
    "however , these spin transport properties can not be generally explained by the existing theory . the recent theoretical model , namely , smr has been proposed to explain the observed ucmr in pt / yig hybrid , which is built on the spin hall and inverse spin hall effects and involves a conversion between the charge and spin current  @xcite . however , the smr model is unable to describe the unusual temperature dependence of ehr whose magnitude and sign are highly non - trivial and the unsaturated ucmr at high fields  @xcite .",
    "there are at least three contributions to the observed ehr in pt / lco hybrids : magnetic proximity effect , spin hall based smr , and spin - dependent interface scattering .",
    "the pt is near the stoner ferromagnetic instability and could become magnetic when contacts with ferromagnetic materials , as shown experimentally by x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) and theoretically by first principle calculation in pt / yig hybrids  @xcite . by injecting the au layer ,",
    "no measurable ehr can be detected for pt(3 nm)/au(6 nm)/yig , indicating the important role of mpe  @xcite .",
    "however , our observed ehr which shows a significantly enhanced ehr at lower temperature can not be simply explained by mpe since the xmcd measurements in pt / yig has revealed a slight decreased average pt moment at room temperature ( 0.054 @xmath92 ) compared to low temperature ( 0.076 @xmath92 at 10 k )  @xcite .",
    "the smr model based on spin hall effect predicts an anomalous hall - like resistance whose magnitude is determined by the imaginary part of the spin mixing conductance  @xcite .",
    "however , the smr model fails to explain the ehr behaviors in our pt / lco as well as previously reported pt / yig hybrids : an arbitrary temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the spin mixing conductance parameter is required to qualitatively describe the temperature dependent ehr data .",
    "particularly , the sign reversal can not even be qualitatively explained .",
    "finally , spin - dependent scattering at the interface , combined with the conventional skew - scattering and side - jump mechanisms  @xcite , can also give rise to ehr in our pt / lco hybrids .",
    "however , there is no existing quantitative theory to compare with our results .",
    "we conclude that non - trivial ehr observed in pt / lco and other similar hybrids demands further theoretical and experimental investigations in order to clarify the dominating mechanisms . on the hand , it is also interesting to investigate the impacts of possible spin state change in lco film on the spin transport properties of pt / lco hybrids .",
    "in summary , we carried out the measurements of transverse hall resistance r@xmath24 and longitudinal resistance r@xmath25 on pt / lco hybrids .",
    "all three types of hybrids , including pt / lco / lao , pt / lco / lsat , and pt / lco / sto , exhibit extraordinary hall resistance and unconventional magnetoresistance below the curie temperature of lco films .",
    "the amplitude of unconventional magnetoresistance and the extraordinary hall resistance on pt / lco hybrids are comparable to pd / yig and pt / yig hybrids .",
    "however , the observed spin transport properties can not be consistently explained by the existing theories , further investigations are needed to clarify this issue .",
