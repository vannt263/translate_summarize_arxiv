    "in quantum mechanics everybody knows that we can measure the component of a spin along a given direction  usually a magnetic field .",
    "why is not possible to measure the `` direction '' of the spin itself , like what we do in classical mechanics ?",
    "there must be a way to define the measurement of the direction of the spin also in quantum mechanics , otherwise we would face a situation which is inconsistent with what we normally do in the macroscopic world !    the situation is somewhat similar to what happens for the measurement of position and momentum : in classical mechanics we can measure both jointly , whereas in quantum mechanics we learn that we can measure either one or the other .",
    "this is true since only exact ( orthogonal ) measurements are usually considered .",
    "however , from quantum estimation theory @xcite we also learned that approximate measurements can be considered as well , and in this way we can define joint measurements of position and momentum , and , in principle , measurements of the direction of a spin .",
    "the first scheme for a joint measurement of non - commuting observables was introduced by arthurs - kelly @xcite .",
    "the problem of evaluating the minimum added noise in the joint measurement of position and momentum  and more generally of a pair of observables whose commutator is not a c - number  was then solved by yuen @xcite , and a similar approach to the problem has been followed in ref . @xcite . in the case of two quadratures of one mode of the electromagnetic field",
    "the problem can be phrased in terms of a coherent positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) whose naimark extension introduces an additional mode of the field : this kind of measurement can be realised by means of a heterodyne detector @xcite .",
    "the case of a joint measurement of the angular momentum is by far more difficult than the joint measurement of position and momentum , and no measurement scheme has appeared in the literature so far .",
    "spin coherent states have been introduced @xcite that can be interpreted as continuous overcomplete povms @xcite , but no physical model has been given for it .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that such coherent - spin povm minimizes suitably defined quantities that represent the precision and disturbance of the measurement , and that such povm would also be optimal for estimating the rotation parameters of a spin @xcite .",
    "even discrete - spectrum povms for the joint measurement of the three components @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the angular momentum have not been analyzed yet , and a physical model based on quantum cloning has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a model for the realization of the measurement of the spin direction would be essential in connecting the quantum with the classical meaning of the angular momentum itself , whence it is of great interest to find viable physical schemes to realize such measurement .",
    "the realization of the spin - direction measurement would also represent a first step toward the achievement of the povm that is needed for teleporting an angular momentum @xcite .    in this paper a first physical model for the measurement of the spin - direction is presented .",
    "it is based on a arthurs - kelly model that involves a sort of magnetic - dipole interaction of the spin with three modes of radiation .",
    "as we will see , the model achieves the optimal povm for spin @xmath0 , in a limit of infinite squeezing of the radiation modes .",
    "the spin coherent states @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , are generated by the action of the unitary operator @xmath6 $ ] , @xmath7 , on the eigenstate @xmath8 of @xmath9 with eigenvalue @xmath10 .",
    "the unitary transformation @xmath11 is a rotation that maps the direction @xmath12 on the direction @xmath13 , where the rotation is performed continuously along the meridian connecting the two directions .",
    "for this reason one has @xmath14 so that each spin coherent state is the eigenvector of @xmath15 with eigenvalue @xmath10 .",
    "this set of states provides the coherent - spin povm @xcite which is given by @xmath16 this povm is a continuous and overcomplete povm that provides an unbiased estimation of the spin direction .",
    "there is no known naimark extension of the povm ( [ spin_povm])i .",
    "e. an orthogonal projective realization of the povm on an enlarged hilbert space : we only know that such extension must be infinite - dimensional , since the povm spectrum is continuous .",
    "we emphasize again that coherent - spin povm ( [ spin_povm ] ) minimizes suitably defined precision and disturbance of the measurement @xcite , and that it is the optimal one for estimating the rotation angles of a spin @xcite .",
    "in the arthurs - kelly scheme @xcite the joint measurement of two non - commuting observables on a single quantum system was obtained upon introducing two auxiliary meters . here",
    "we let a spin @xmath17 interact with three independent radiation modes @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 for a time interval @xmath21 , according to the following kind of magnetic - dipole interaction @xmath22= \\exp\\bigg[-it\\jv\\cdot\\yv\\bigg]\\ ; , \\label{evolutor}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the quadrature @xmath24 , and all phases have been included in the definition of the annihilation operators @xmath25 .",
    "we fix the preparation of the radiation field in the squeezed state @xmath26 with @xmath27 is the wavefunction on the basis of the eigenstates of @xmath23 . after the interaction , the measurement of the quadratures @xmath28",
    "is performed through independent homodyne detection on each mode .",
    "the outcome of the measurement is a vector @xmath29 , and the resulting povm for the spin system is given by @xmath30d\\xv=\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\omega_\\lambda^\\dagger(\\xv)\\,\\omega_\\lambda(\\xv)\\,d\\xv\\;,\\label{pil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the trace over radiation modes , @xmath32 is the identity for the spin hilbert space , and @xmath33 . by inserting the completeness relation for the operators @xmath23 in the matrix element @xmath34 ,",
    "@xmath35 can be rewritten as follows @xmath36 we are now interested in the limit of eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) for infinitely squeezed radiation @xmath37 .    in order to simplify the analysis",
    ", we exploit the rotation covariance of the operator @xmath35 @xmath38 along with the fact that @xmath39 commutes with @xmath15 , namely it is diagonal on the eigenvectors of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , it is enough to evaluate the matrix elements @xmath40 on eigenstates @xmath41 of @xmath3 .",
    "we also know that such matrix element is real , since @xmath42 is self - adjoint .",
    "therefore , we are interested in the following evaluation @xmath43 the function @xmath44 , where @xmath13 points in the direction @xmath45 , does not depend on @xmath46 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath47 is a unit vector pointing in the direction @xmath48 , one has @xmath49v(\\nv)\\exp[-i\\delta j_3]$ ] , and thus @xmath50 is equal to its real part , the last integral in eq .",
    "( [ step1 ] ) can be replaced with its real part .",

    "notice also that depending on the chosen sign of @xmath21 , only a definite sign of @xmath63 will contribute for @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath55 , eq . ( [ popo ] )",

    ", we get a `` mixed '' povm which is not the optimal coherent - spin one .",
    "we have presented a first model for a physical realization of the measurement of the spin direction , corresponding to the coherent - spin povm , which also represents the optimal estimation of spin rotation angles . in our arthurs - kelly model , the spin",
    "is coupled with three radiation modes that are homodyne detected after the interaction . in the limit of highly squeezed radiation the coherent - spin povm",
