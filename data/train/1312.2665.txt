    "the dicke model describes the interaction between a system of @xmath0 two - level atoms and a single mode of a radiation field within a cavity .",

    "i.e. _ no photons and all atoms in their ground state .",
    "the superradiant phase is characterized by a macroscopic population of the upper atomic level and a comparable average photon number in the ground state of the system .    in general , for finite @xmath0 the dicke hamiltonian is not integrable . however , it has two integrable limits : when @xmath24 and when @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "moreover , when the coupling is weak it is possible to make the _ rotating wave approximation _ , by ignoring the counter - rotating terms .",
    "the result is another integrable limit , the tavis - cummings hamiltonian @xcite @xmath26 the tc hamiltonian is integrable because it commutes with the @xmath16 operator .",
