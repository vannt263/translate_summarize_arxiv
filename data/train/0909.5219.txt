    "in general , annihilation process can be described with an effective lagrangian of the following form : @xmath2 any additional operators will be of higher dimension and therefore their contribution will be suppressed .",
    "completing the textbook level calculation of the cross - section one can get @xmath3    assuming that we deal with non - relativistic light dark matter , we present transferred energy as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a mass of dark matter particle .",
    "another assumption we make is that dm particles are distributed according to maxwell - boltzman distribution .",
    "after we expand cross - section around @xmath6 and average it with mb distribution @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the following combinations of wilson coefficients @xmath10 @xmath11 + 4re[a_2\\frac{\\partial a_2}{\\partial s}]))\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with their values taken at @xmath6 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a fraction @xmath12 which means that in most cases the contribution from the second term is negligible .",
    "the differential flux of photons produced by dm annihilations is @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the angle between the galactic center and the line of observation , and @xmath15}{4\\pi}\\ ] ] is an integral along line of sight which depends on the choice of dark mater halo profile .",
    "as it was argued in @xcite , the maximum flux will be in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "the highest value of flux is given by the choice of navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile for the dm distribution .",
    "this will provide us with the upper limit on the theoretical value of the photon flux and on the parameters of dark matter . using results from the same paper",
    "we obtain : @xmath16 in this result the dependence on the particle physics dynamics is separated from the structure of dark matter halo .    to proceed further we need to introduce mechanism of dm annihilation .",
    "as electrically neutral field dm can not be coupled to the photons directly .",
    "it is natural to assume that for the light dark matter ( @xmath17 ) the only relevant couplings are the ones that couple it to the standard model fermions .",
    "if we limit ourselves to the operators of the highest possible dimension six , the effective lagrangian will take the form    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is a heavy mass scale , for example mass of heavy mediator that provides the interaction between the sm and the dm sectors .",
    "the operators are defined as @xmath20 the choice is such that they are hermitian and their wilson coefficients @xmath21 are real .",
    "@xmath14 are the sm fermion fields .",
    "there are only two types of diagrams that contribute to the annihilation process ( fig.[fig : sub ] )     [ fig : sub : a ]   [ fig : sub : b ]     for computation of annihilation rate the contribution from all possible fermions should be taken into account ( i.e. summation over leptons and quarks performed ) .",
    "summation is assumed and charge of loop fermions is denoted as @xmath22 in the analytical expressions presented further in text .",
    "explicit calculation of those diagrams using introduced generic lagrangian leads to the following wilson coefficients @xmath23 : @xmath24    where , @xmath25 is the mandelstam variable @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a passarino - veltman three - point function , and for particular set of parameters arising here it can be expressed analytically in the following form : @xmath28 it is worth pointing out , that our result for annihilation cross section via channel governed by operator @xmath29 essentially reproduces the result of @xcite for annihilation of higgs boson into two photons and does not vanish in the heavy fermion mass limit .",
    "also , when the mass of the dark matter particle is close to the mass of the fermion in the loop , some low energy resonance states that increase annihilation cross - section might appear .",
    "such a situation needs special treatment and is not considered here .",
    "let us now use the experimental data to put constraints onto @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "experimental data from egret can be parameterized in the following way @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 ^ 2}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{\\ for \\ } |l|\\geq30\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the highest flux will be from the direction of the galactic center , we need to compute flux at @xmath34 .",
    "there was no monochromatic peak observed at egret , which means that intensity of flux from dark matter annihilation is less than diffuse background .",
    "this leads to the following constraining condition : @xmath35 assuming annihilation of dm particles that are at rest , photon spectrum will be a monochromatic line with @xmath36 .",
    "detector measuring spectrum has finite resolution , thus instead of @xmath37-function a spectrum integrated over some region of energies will be measured .",
    "considering several different masses of dm particles leads to the following constrains that can be placed on coupling constants : @xmath38 which are presented graphically on the fig.[fig : limits : a ]     [ fig : limits : a ] , green -@xmath39 , blue -@xmath40 , pink -@xmath41 and yellow - @xmath42,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] [ fig : limits : b ] , green -@xmath39 , blue -@xmath40 , pink -@xmath41 and yellow - @xmath42,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    however , in real - life situation the spectrum will be smeared due to thermal motion of dm particle , orbital motion of earth , etc . and",
    "therefore energy spectrum will have a shape of a peak of finite width and finite height instead of @xmath37-function .",
    "assuming good enough resolution of experimental set up , this peak might be detected .",
    "thermal velocity of dm particles is taken to be @xmath43 @xcite and taking into account orbital motion of earth we approximate spectrum as a gaussian distribution with @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "such a choice of @xmath46 among all experimental data provides us with the most narrow and high peak .",
    "it will be very easy detectable and will lead to the highest values of upper bounds on dm model parameters .",
    "the results after relative motion is considered are presented at eq.[limits2 ] and fig.[fig : limits : b ] @xmath47    realistically , after taking into account all possible effects , contsrains will be somewhere between ones provided in eq.[limits1 ] , fig.[fig : limits : a ] and ones given in eq.[limits2 ] , fig.[fig : limits : b ]",
    "as an example we consider dm annihilation in framework of minimal scalar dark matter model ( see for example @xcite ) . in this model dm interaction with standard model fields is mediated by exchange of a higgs boson .",
    "the model is restricted based on relic abundance calculations , however due to its simplicity it is perfect for testing of our approach .",
    "the matching conditions for the wilson coefficients have the following form : @xmath48 inserting these parameters into model - independent bounds derived in eq.[limits1 ] and eq.[limits2 ] leads to the following constrains onto parameters of this model : @xmath49 for case of static dm and @xmath50 if we take thermal motion of dark matter particles into consideration .",
    "as one can see , the obtained constraints are not very restrictive for this particular model .",
    "however , consideration of the models with enhanced couplings ( for example two higgs doublet model ) provides more strict constraints onto the parameters of the model @xcite .",
