    "the bulk of the baryons in galaxy clusters are in their hot gas component , the intracluster medium ( icm ) , which typically contains 5 - 10 times the mass found in cluster galaxies .",

    "the abundances of different species can be used to constrain the relative numbers of type ia ( sne  ia ) and type ii ( sne  ii ) supernovae that occurred in the cluster galaxies .",
    "this is because the abundances of the @xmath0 elements ( e.g. o , mg ) are driven primarily by the rate of sne  ii , whereas the production of iron is dominated by sne  ia .",
    "the abundance of @xmath0 elements in the icm is found , from x - ray measurements , to be comparable to abundances in the solar neighbourhood , whereas the abundance of iron is only about 30% of that found locally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the former two papers find that the observed icm metallicities are only reproduced in models in which the chemical yield is twice the standard value for a solar neighbourhood imf , in agreement with the conclusions from monolithic collapse models .",
    "the first attempt to take into account metal enrichment due to sne  ia in hierarchical galaxy formation models was that of @xcite and @xcite . however , their calculations used only the star formation histories for spiral and elliptical galaxies extracted from the munich group s semi - analytical model , and assumed closed - box chemical evolution .",

    "the metal enrichment due to sne  ia was consistently included in a semi - analytical model for the first time by @xcite , who took into account the recycling of metals between stars , the cold gas in the disk and the hot halo gas . while the lifetime of sne  ia s was simply assumed to be a constant 1.5gyr , their model provides good agreement with the observed distributions of [ fe / h ] and of [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] for both solar neighbourhood and bulge stars , based on a salpeter - like imf .",

    "the model also computes the luminosities and colours of galaxies from their star formation histories and metallicities , using a stellar population model and including a treatment of dust extinction .",

    "( note that the `` metal incorporation '' redshifts given here are different from the `` metal production '' redshifts derived from fig .",
    "[ fig : hist2 ] , since the latter include ejected metals among the metals produced by a given redshift , provided these ejected metals have been recaptured by the present day . ) since we assume the same @xmath6cdm cosmology as de  lucia et al .",
    ", the differences must arise from using somewhat different assumptions about gas cooling , star formation , feedback and gas ejection .",
    "mergers of halos are expected to lead to extensive mixing of the icm , which will tend to erase any metallicity gradients .",
    "the prediction of the models that typically most of the iron in the icm is produced well before half of the cluster mass has been assembled then seems to make it harder to understand the iron abundance gradients seen in `` cooling flow '' clusters .",
    "however , since the production of iron by sne  ia is long - delayed , it may still be possible to build up iron abundance gradients in the central regions of clusters by ejection of iron from the central galaxy after most of the cluster mass has been assembled .",
    "this problem needs to be investigated using gas - dynamical simulations of cluster formation .",
    "we have also calculated the build - up of metals within cluster galaxies , counting metals in both stars and in the cold gas .",
    "when we compute trajectories for the evolution of the total mass in metals in galaxies summed over all cluster progenitors , relative to the present metal mass , we find that there is very little dispersion between different clusters of the same mass ( much less than for the icm metal mass shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist2 ] ) .",
    "the trajectories are also very similar for different ranges of cluster temperature , and for the superwind and conduction models . for clusters in the temperature range @xmath202kev , half of the o mass in cluster galaxies is produced by redshifts @xmath203 for the superwind model , and by @xmath204 in the conduction model .",
    "for the fe mass in cluster galaxies , the corresponding redshifts are @xmath205 in the superwind model , and @xmath206 in the conduction model .",
    "the metals in cluster galaxies are thus produced significantly earlier than the metals in the icm .",
    "=    finally , we examine which galaxies contribute the most to cluster metal enrichment . fig .",
    "[ fig : metaldist ] shows the total amount of iron which galaxies have produced ( either retained within the galaxy , injected into the icm , or ejected from the cluster ) as a function of their @xmath152-band luminosities at @xmath15 .",
    "the contribution of each galaxy is calculated by summing the iron production over its formation history .",
    "the distributions over luminosity @xmath207 are then normalized to unit area .",
    "results are shown for both the superwind and conduction models , and also split according to present - day cluster temperature .",
    "the solid line in each panel shows the iron production averaged over halos of all masses ( including halos much smaller than clusters ) .",
    "these distributions are quite similar to the distributions of total stellar mass , which is expected since the mass of iron produced is closely related to the mass of stars formed .",
    "we also find that the normalized distributions for the mass of iron injected into the icm are very similar to the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : metaldist ] for the total mass of iron produced .",
    "the distributions of iron production in fig .",
    "[ fig : metaldist ] for the clusters show pronounced peaks at the high luminosity end .",
    "as the cluster mass or temperature increases , the position of the peak moves up in luminosity , but its amplitude decreases .",
    "this peak is produced by the central galaxies in the cluster halos , and reflects the distribution of total stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the peak is most prominent for the lowest temperature clusters , because mergers are most effective at concentrating the stellar mass into a single central galaxy in such systems .",
    "since the position of the peak due to central galaxies depends on halo mass , it is smeared out when we average over all halos , producing a smoother distribution ( see the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : metaldist ] ) .",
    "we find that in the superwind model , half of the iron is produced by galaxies with luminosities @xmath208 brighter than @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 for low , medium and high temperature clusters respectively , corresponding to galaxy stellar masses @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 respectively . the median galaxy masses and luminosities for oxygen production are almost identical to those for iron . in the conduction model ,",
    "the median galaxy masses and luminosities for metal production are somewhat higher : for iron production , the median k - band luminosities are @xmath215 , @xmath216 and @xmath217 , and the median stellar masses are @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 respectively , with very similar values for oxygen production .",
    "when we look at metal production averaged over halos of all masses , we find median luminosities @xmath208 for producing fe or o of @xmath210 and @xmath221 respectively for the superwind and conduction models , and median stellar masses of @xmath222 and @xmath223 respectively .",
    "we thus see that the median k - band luminosity ( or stellar mass ) for metal production is similar ( within a given model ) for high mass clusters and field galaxies , but significantly larger in low mass clusters . for comparison ,",
    "the characteristic luminosity of field galaxies in the k - band is @xmath224 @xcite .",
    "the metal production in clusters and in the field is thus predicted to be dominated by galaxies with @xmath225 .    in our models ,",
    "the median galaxy luminosities and masses for metal injection into the icm are almost identical to those for metal production .",
    "our median stellar masses for metal production are 23 times larger in the case of the most massive clusters than the median galaxy mass of @xmath226 for metal ( effectively oxygen ) injection into the icm calculated by @xcite for a @xmath201 cluster .",
    "however , we are in agreement de lucia et al . on the general conclusion that the icm metal enrichment is dominated by fairly massive galaxies , in contrast to suggestions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that metal ejection by dwarf galaxies has dominated the chemical enrichment of the icm .",
    "we have investigated the metal enrichment of the icm for clusters of different masses using a semi - analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution , galform ( cole et al .",
    "we have implemented in this model a detailed treatment of metal production by both sne  ia and sne  ii , based on the predictions of stellar evolution models for both stellar lifetimes and yields of different heavy elements .",
    "this enables us to follow the evolution of different elements ( o , mg , si and fe ) , including the long time delays for sne  ia . our model consistently calculates the cycling of gas and metals between stars , cold gas and hot gas .",
    "in order to reproduce the observed present - day galaxy luminosity function using a realistic baryon fraction in the models , we have considered two alternative mechanisms to prevent the overproduction of bright galaxies : ( a ) galactic superwinds which expel gas and metals from dark halos , with subsequent recapture in very massive halos , and ( b ) thermal conduction which transfers heat from the outer to the central regions of hot gas halos , thereby supressing gas cooling .",
    "we considered two different imfs for bursts of star formation : the kennicutt imf that we also adopt for quiescent disk star formation , and a top - heavy , flat imf with @xmath7 .",
    "we have found that the form of the imf is strongly constrained by the metal abundances of o , mg , si and fe in the icm .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a top - heavy imf in starbursts is required in order to obtain icm metal abundances as high as those observed , when the imf for quiescent star formation in disks is fixed to be a standard , bottom - heavy imf , such as the kennicutt imf .",
    "a burst imf with @xmath7 reproduces the observed metal abundances in the icm .",
    "we have also tried the arimoto - yoshii imf with @xmath179 in bursts , and confirmed that it fails to produce sufficient metals .",
    "considering that the imf for quiescent star formation has been well constrained by many studies , including a semi - analytical model @xcite , this is strong evidence in support of a top - heavy imf with @xmath178 in starbursts .",
    "2 .   both the superwind and conduction models reproduce the observed icm metal abundances and abundance ratios .",
    "the superwind model predicts lower metal abundances in low temperature ( @xmath227 kev ) clusters .",
    "therefore if the drop in [ fe / h ] for clusters with @xmath227 kev found using _ asca _ is real",
    ", this could be evidence for the action of superwinds .",
    "the current data are still limited , however , so future observations , particularly of low temperature clusters , would strongly constrain the superwind model .",
    "our model is in broad agreement with the observed ratio of icm gas mass to the total @xmath161-band stellar luminosity in clusters , @xmath159 . in particular ,",
    "the superwind model predicts a decrease of @xmath228 in low temperature clusters , as is observed , because the superwind expels gas from these clusters .",
    "the iron metallicity , [ fe / h ] , is predicted to decrease only slowly with increasing redshift .",
    "the difference in [ fe / h ] between @xmath15 and 1 is at most 0.2 dex .",
    "this mild evolution is broadly consistent with the recent observations by @xcite .",
    "in contrast with [ fe / h ] , [ o / h ] is almost independent of redshift over this range , so [ o / fe ] increases with redshift .",
    "the metal production histories of clusters having the same present - day mass are very similar .",
    "in contrast , the cluster mass assembly histories show a wide variety .",
    "this suggests that the variety of metallicity gradients observed in clusters may be caused not only by observational errors but also by the variety of assembly histories .",
    "presumably this is the origin of the diversity in the observed metallicities of present - day clusters , because most observations measure metallicities only at cluster centres .",
    "6 .   in clusters and in the field ,",
    "metal production is dominated by galaxies with k - band luminosities similar to or brighter than @xmath1 . in low - mass clusters ,",
    "the contribution of the central galaxy to metal production is very important , but this effect is weaker in high - mass clusters .    throughout this paper , we have neglected any contribution of intracluster stars to the metal enrichment of the icm , since in our model all stars are in galaxies .",
    "based on recent measurements of the intracluster light , it has been suggested that intracluster stars might have produced a large fraction of the iron observed in the icm @xcite .",
    "the intracluster stars would presumably originate from material tidally stripped from galaxies or ejected during violent mergers , so the luminosity function of galaxies in clusters would also be affected . in our model ,",
    "tidal stripping of stars from galaxies would not affect the total mass of iron produced ( if all other parameters remain the same ) , but it might affect the fraction of the iron which is ejected into the icm .",
    "this possibility clearly deserves further observational and theoretical study .",
    "it is also evident that , in order to better constrain our model , we need more accurate icm metallicity measurements for larger samples of clusters .",
    "these measurements need to cover the outer parts of clusters as well as the central regions , in order derive accurate global metallicities .",
    "the observational situation will be substantially improved by the _ astro - e2 _ satellite scheduled for launch in 2005 , as well as by further data from _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra_. further constraints on the model can be obtained by examining the abundances of different heavy elements in galaxies , and we will investigate this latter topic in future papers .",

    "the metallicity at the cluster centre , @xmath240 in eq.([eqn : metalgrad ] ) , depends on the individual cluster . using the above equations and the values at @xmath250 , at which the observed data are given in the above papers , we obtain the average metallicity @xmath251 within the virial radius ( @xmath252 , corresponding to @xmath253 in a @xmath6cdm universe ) , @xmath254 the average [ fe / h ]",
    "is easily estimated from @xmath251 .",
    "peterson et al . ( 2003 ) observed only the central parts of clusters within a @xmath255 angular radius .",
    "their observed metallicities of fe and si are assumed to correspond to @xmath256 , where @xmath257 is the radius at which the angular size is equal to 1 arcmin .",
    "the average metallicity within the virial radius is then obtained from @xmath258 the parameters regarding redshift and structure required to obtain averaged metallicities are tabulated in their paper .",
    "recent observations suggest that the metallicity gradients of si are very similar to those of fe @xcite .",
    "therefore we assume that si has the same shape of metallicity profile as fe .",
    "as already mentioned , because o and mg seem not to have any metallicity gradients , we regard the observed values of central metallicities as equivalent to the metallicities averaged over the whole cluster .      the measurements of fe and si abundances by fukazawa et al .",
    "( 1998 ) include data from the outer parts of the clusters .",
    "we therefore assume that their abundance measurements are close to global averages , and do not apply any corrections .",
    "@xcite obtained average abundances of several elements , including fe and si , in bins of cluster temperature by performing a stacking analysis of observations of 273 clusters from the _ asca _ archives .",
    "although their cluster sample is large , metallicity gradients combined with the large point spread function for _ asca _ cause problems for interpreting their results , especially for fe .",
    "the iron abundance is usually estimated from the fe - k or fe - l lines . for high - temperature clusters ,",
    "the photon flux in the fe - k line is larger than that in the fe - l line , and the fe - k line yields accurate measurements of the iron abundance . on the other hand , for low and intermediate temperature clusters , the fe - k line becomes very weak , and the photon flux is larger in the fe - l line , so the fe - l line dominates in abundance estimates .",
    "lower temperature gas emits more photons in the fe - l line than in the fe - k line .",
    "this has the consequence that for clusters with cooling cores , the observationally - estimated iron abundance is weighted towards the value in the low temperature component , that is , the central region , where the iron abundance is typically higher than the average over the whole cluster .",
    "thus , as @xcite have done , the data for the central region should be removed to get a fairer estimate of the metallicity averaged over the whole cluster .",
    "@xcite have not done this , and this may be the reason why their data show an enhancement of the iron metallicity at intermediate cluster temperatures .",
    "for this reason , we do not include their data on fe abundances in our comparison with the models .",
    "their data on si abundances seem to be less affected by this problem , so we do include those data in our comparison ."
