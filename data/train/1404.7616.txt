    "<S> the entanglement area law ( or simply the area law ) is one of the prominent  @xcite . for a many - body pure state @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the bipartite entanglement between a subregion ( @xmath1 ) and the rest ( @xmath2 ) is quantified by the entanglement entropy @xmath3 , the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath3 has an upper bound proportional to the surface area of @xmath1 , we say @xmath0 obeys the area law  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that ground states of local hamiltonians typically obey the area law  @xcite , possibly with a multiplicative logarithmic correction  @xcite , although one can deliberately construct a counterexample  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the area law is indeed a very special feature because in a large hilbert space , almost all states , in the sense of the haar measure , exhibit a volume - law scaling of the entanglement entropy ; the states obeying the area law actually belong to a measure - zero set  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this anomaly leads to diverse and profound implications across various fields , e.g. , in classical simulations of quantum systems  @xcite , topological quantum phases  @xcite , and hamiltonian complexity theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conceptually , the area law is also reminiscent of the holographic principle  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has thus been of crucial importance to find out the general mechanism and criteria of the area law . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> one of the prominent open problems has been whether the area law is generally obeyed in gapped local systems in high dimension , since its one - dimensional problem was solved in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in this context , the fundamental question in hand is concerning the entanglement entropy of the ground state @xmath5 of a general local @xmath6-body hamiltonian @xmath7 having a finite spectral gap @xmath8 for sufficiently large @xmath6  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as it turned out , in an arbitrary spatial dimension , proving ( or disproving ) the area law in such a general case is a daunting task at present . from a practical point of view </S>",
    "<S> , however , if we are in a position to tackle ordinary many - body systems ( e.g. , as in the context of classical simulations of quantum systems  @xcite ) , we may bring in a few empirical assumptions without sacrificing much of the generality , thereby significantly relaxing the technical difficulties and furthermore offering a clear - cut insight into the problem . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we note that a many - body system is generally defined in terms of its microscopic details ( i.e. , its constituent particles , mutual interactions , external potential , etc . ) , while the system size @xmath6 is actually variable . formally speaking , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath7 is given , it is implicitly taken for granted that there also exist hamiltonians @xmath9 with @xmath10 and importantly all different @xmath9 share the common defining characteristics of the system . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when we say a certain system is gapped , it generally means that @xmath11 for any @xmath12 with a lower bound @xmath13 . here , </S>",
    "<S> all the different - sized ground states @xmath14 represent essentially the same matter and in the thermodynamic limit , if exists , any local observable can not discriminate between different @xmath6 as it becomes an intensive quantity . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it reasonable to assume that @xmath14 and @xmath15 have a finite overlap ( i.e. , they are nonorthogonal ) after the boundary effect is properly washed out ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) so that they share a common subspace that encapsulates the characteristic features of the system , e.g. , the order parameters , correlation functions , and so on . otherwise , the bulk properties of the system would be utterly unpredictable in practice as they will be drastically altered by a microscopic change of the system size , rendering the system unstable .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider such a practical situation and prove the entanglement area law in arbitrary - dimensional gapped local spin systems under two general conditions drawn from the above reasoning . before proceeding , let us first clarify our notation . </S>",
    "<S> we consider arbitrary systems of @xmath6 locally - interacting finite - dimensional spins placed on a @xmath16-dimensional lattice with one spin per site . for the ` localness ' of the interaction to make sense , the lattice has two properties . </S>",
    "<S> first , the euclidean distance @xmath17 and the graph distance @xmath18 between sites @xmath19 and @xmath20 satisfy @xmath21 for some constant @xmath22 . </S>",

    "<S> for given site @xmath19 , we define sets of neighboring sites as follows : @xmath26 the interaction being local means that @xmath6-spin hamiltonians can be written as a sum of local terms supported on @xmath27 for @xmath28 with @xmath29 being a constant bounding the range of the interaction . the trace distance between density matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> is denoted by @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the trace norm . </S>",
    "<S> the operator norm is denoted by @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> the two conditions we impose are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , there exist a sequence of hamiltonians with different systems sizes @xmath35 having nondegenerate ground states @xmath36 and finite spectral gap @xmath11 for all @xmath12 . here , we index the spins in such a way that the @xmath12-spin system is constructed by adding the @xmath12-th spin on the boundary of the @xmath37-spin system ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the interaction is local , @xmath9 and @xmath38 differ by a local term @xmath39 supported on @xmath40 ( not @xmath41 in general because there can be distinct boundary terms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction strength is finite , which means @xmath42 for some constant @xmath43 .    -spin and </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12-spin systems differ only locally . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced density matrices of the ground states @xmath44 and @xmath45 are obtained by tracing out a local neighborhood of spin @xmath12 . in this illustration , @xmath46 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> second , for all @xmath12 , the ground states @xmath47 and @xmath48 have a finite overlap in the sense that there exist constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 such that @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . for @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> , this condition means that when the ground state @xmath47 is written in terms of the eigenstates of @xmath38 and the states of spin @xmath12 as @xmath54 , the coefficient @xmath55 associated with the ground state @xmath48 is non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> although this seems intuitively natural , one can imagine a counterexample , albeit quite artificial , in which the entire system undergoes a quantum phase transition by a single change of the particle number at the boundary ( see the appendix ) . as mentioned </S>",
    "<S> , such an exceptional case is not of our interest in this work .    </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this paper is the following theorem .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a lattice spin system satisfying the above two conditions . </S>",
    "<S> take a subregion @xmath1 , which is a @xmath16-dimensional ball of radius @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> for the ground state , the entanglement entropy of this region is bounded as @xmath57 where @xmath58 s are constants determined by above - defined system parameters @xmath13 , @xmath43 , @xmath16 , @xmath22 , @xmath25 , @xmath29 , @xmath50 , and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the upper bound of @xmath3 scales as @xmath59 , satisfying the area law .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we took the ball - shaped region to simplify the proof . </S>",
    "<S> generalization to the case of a different shape is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> note that the area law makes sense only for simple - shaped regions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the surface area of a fractal shape can be arbitrarily large .    </S>",
    "<S> the underlying idea of the proof is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> take a subregion @xmath60 to be a @xmath16-dimensional ball of radius @xmath61 centered at the origin of region @xmath1 with positive constant @xmath62 to be chosen later ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> suppose there are @xmath63 spins in region @xmath1 , @xmath64 spins in region @xmath60 , and @xmath65 spins in the rest . </S>",
    "<S> our strategy is to take a particular sequence of ground states @xmath66 in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) @xmath67 is the ground state of the @xmath68-spin system corresponding to region @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) @xmath69 is the ground state of the whole system . ( 3 ) @xmath47 ( @xmath70 ) is the ground state of an intermediate system . </S>",
    "<S> here we choose the @xmath12-th spin , among @xmath71 remaining ones , to be the one having the shortest euclidean distance to the origin , whereby the shape of the system is retained as far as possible for all @xmath12 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) . for each ground state in the sequence , we can obtain the reduced density matrix for region @xmath1 , @xmath72 . note that @xmath73 is bounded by the logarithm of the hilbert space dimension for region @xmath74 . </S>",

    "<S> the ensuing procedure is based on the following intuitive picture . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we try to identify @xmath47 with @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a unitary operator supported on @xmath81 and @xmath82 is any state of spin @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the exact identity would be obtained only for sufficiently large @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath84 . however </S>",
    "<S> , one can see that the spectral gap can play a role here in approximating @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> note that both @xmath38 and @xmath9 are gapped . _ </S>",
    "<S> if _ @xmath86 also remains gapped for @xmath87 , where @xmath88 , we can then consider an adiabatic passage from @xmath89 to @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , @xmath90 is likely to be gapped for appropriately chosen @xmath82 since only a small portion of the hamiltonian is varied and @xmath48 and @xmath47 are essentially the same kind of states and hence no quantum phase transition occurs . for the moment </S>",
    "<S> , suppose it is the case . </S>",
    "<S> if so , as the adiabatic passage can be done in a finite time scale ( inversely - proportional to @xmath13 ) and the hamiltonian is varied only locally , the lieb - robinson bound implies that the adiabatic process can affect the system only ( quasi-)locally , which means that @xmath91 is approximately local . </S>",
    "<S> one can thus write @xmath92 for some constant @xmath93 up to a small error . </S>",
    "<S> _ if _ we neglect the error for the moment , we can choose @xmath78 to satisfy @xmath94 so that every term in the summation of eq .   vanishes because @xmath95 does not act on region @xmath1 , resulting in the area law . </S>",
    "<S> conceptually , what happens is that the boundary effect spreads no further than @xmath96 away and thus @xmath97 converges to @xmath98 once @xmath12 reaches the point where region @xmath1 does not recognize the existence of a boundary any more .    in the above picture , </S>",
    "<S> we have made two logical jumps to be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> first , it should be ensured that @xmath90 is indeed gapped . </S>",
    "<S> second , @xmath91 is only approximately local and thus we need to work out how the errors add up . as a preliminary step , note that condition   implies there is a unitary operator @xmath99 acting on @xmath100 such that @xmath101 , which follows from the uhlmann s theorem  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> as @xmath181 and @xmath182 yield entanglement entropies @xmath183 and @xmath184 for region @xmath1 , respectively , we can examine @xmath148 to obtain the bound . note that @xmath182 is obtained by evolving @xmath181 through eq .   during unit time . by performing the trotter expansion </S>",
    "<S> , one realizes that only @xmath152 s with @xmath185 can affect the entanglement entropy . by using the small incremental entangling theorem </S>",

    "<S> as a final remark , we note that our approach in its current form is not applicable to topologically ordered systems in general as our inherent physical setting based on an open boundary condition and nondegenerate ground states is not compatible with the nontrivial topology of the space and the topological degeneracy , which are the essential attributes of topological quantum phases  @xcite . </S>",
