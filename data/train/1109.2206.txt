    "an electron bunch excites wakefields when passing through an accelerating cavity .",
    "these wakefields can be decomposed into higher order modes ( hom ) , whose transverse components are usually dominated by dipole modes  @xcite .",
    "dipole modes have a linear relation to the transverse beam position of the excitation bunch .",
    "therefore , the beam offset within the cavity can be determined by monitoring the dipole modes .",
    "the principle has been proved on 1.3  ghz tesla cavities @xcite , and we intend to apply the idea to the third harmonic cavities @xcite .",
    "third harmonic cavities operating at 3.9  ghz were installed in flash @xcite at desy to linearize the energy spread of the electron bunch induced by the main accelerating module containing tesla cavities for bunch compression @xcite .",
    "there are four inter - connected 3.9  ghz cavities in the cryo - module acc39 ( fig .",
    "[ cavity - cartoon ] ) . due to the small size of the 3.9  ghz cavity itself ( scaled down from 1.3  ghz cavity by a factor of 3 ) and the larger - diameter beam pipes connecting the cavities ( larger than one - third of those of the 1.3  ghz cavity )",
    ", the hom spectrum is much more complex than that of the 1.3  ghz cavity @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that the dipole beampipe modes and the first two dipole passbands respond well to the beam movement @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the fifth dipole passband .",
    "most of the dipole cavity modes couple to adjacent cavities through attached beam pipes . however , there are modes in the fifth dipole band trapped within each cavity .",
    "a simulation is performed on an ideal cavity without couplers using cst microwave studio @xcite , with a convergence of 0.0001% , 1.3  million mesh cells and electric boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting field distributions are shown in table .",
    "[ simu - table ] along with the mode frequencies and r / qs . the first 4 modes seems trapped but weak couplings to the beam are expected because of small r / q values .",
    ".the fifth dipole band from the simulation [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ simu - table ]    to examine whether the modes are trapped in real cavities , various measurements were conducted both with and without beam - excitation .",
    "the transmission spectra measured at the single cavity test stand in fermilab have been analyzed .",
    "the result for c1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ rsa - cmtb - fnal - c1 ] ( black curve ) .",
    "the mode frequencies deviate from simulations because the cavity is not ideal and the couplers break the symmetry of the ideal structure . also , the cavity was not tuned to the accelerating mode frequency ( 3.9  ghz ) . then the spectrum measured across c1 , after assembly in the cryo - module at cmtb ( cryo - module test bench ) , is shown as red curve in fig .",
    "[ rsa - cmtb - fnal - c1 ] .",
    "the modes shift in frequency and/or change in shape , due to cavity tuning , etc . to test the mode localization ,",
    "the spectra are compared with the measurement across the entire four - cavity string ( from c1h2 to c4h2 , magenta curve in fig .",
    "[ rsa - cmtb - fnal - c1 ] ) . comparing with the single cavity spectrum ( red curve in fig .",
    "[ rsa - cmtb - fnal - c1 ] ) , modes below 9.08  ghz do not propagate .",
    "these modes are of great interest for our study , because they enable the beam position to be determined within each cavity .",
    "beam - excited spectra were measured in flash by using a real - time spectrum analyzer ( rsa ) from all eight hom couplers ( blue curve in fig .",
    "[ rsa - cmtb - fnal - c1 ] ) . the spectrum from 9 to 9.05  ghz was excited by a single electron bunch with a charge of about 0.5  nc , while the one from 9.05 to 9.1  ghz was excited by another single electron bunch with almost the same beam properties .",
    "compared with cmtb spectra ( red and magenta curves in fig .",
    "[ rsa - cmtb - fnal - c1 ] ) , modes excited by the beam are in general consistent with those from transmission measurements , while some modes were not picked up by the hom coupler or simply not excited by the beam .        both simulations and measurements show that some modes in the fifth dipole band are trapped below 9.08  ghz . as the spectrum above 9.05  ghz",
    "is excited by a single bunch , the spectrum from 9.05 to 9.08  ghz is used for the following analysis .",
    "to investigate the response of dipole modes to the transverse beam position , we moved the beam to create various transverse offsets in the cavity .",
    "the measurement setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ hom - setup ] .",
    "two steering magnets were used to kick the beam horizontally and vertically . the bunch ( about 0.5  nc ) was subsequently accelerated by acc1 , then went through acc39 with various transverse offsets . the position within each cavity",
    "is obtained by interpolating the readouts from two beam position monitors ( bpm - a and bpm - b in fig .",
    "[ hom - setup ] ) , which are situated on each side of acc39 .",
    "a straight - line trajectory of the beam was attained by switching off the accelerating field in acc39 and quadrupole magnets nearby .",
    "initially , the beam was kicked horizontally without changing the vertical steerer .",
    "the mode amplitude varies with the horizontal offset , as shown in fig .",
    "[ amp - cross - d5 ] for one mode at about 9.0562  ghz measured from c2h2 .",
    "the vertical position in c2 varies by @xmath00.29  mm . by exploiting a lorentzian fit , the amplitude of each peak in fig .",
    "[ amp - cross - d5 ] is obtained and plotted against the horizontal beam position in fig .",
    "[ dep - cross - x - d5 ] .",
    "linear dependence of the mode amplitude on the transverse beam position can be observed , which is a dipole - like behavior .",
    "the beam was then moved in a grid - like manner , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d - grid ] .",
    "the tilt is attributed to coupling between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 planes caused by the acc1 module and the two bpms .",
    "the data are split into calibration samples ( blue dots ) and validation samples ( red asterisks ) for further analysis .",
    "the amplitude of the same mode is again obtained by lorentzian fit for each beam position , and plotted in fig .",
    "[ dep - grid - d5 ] .",
    "the color denotes the amplitude magnitude .",
    "the polarization of this mode can be observed .      to study the dipole linear dependence , a",
    "_ direct linear regression _ ( dlr ) is applied on the spectra ( fig .",
    "[ svd - reco ] ) by @xmath3 where each row of matrix @xmath4 denotes a spectrum amplitude in linear scale ( normalized by beam charge ) taken at one beam position , each row of matrix @xmath5 denotes one set of transverse beam position in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and @xmath6 is an offset matrix .",
    "the linear system is solved by least - squares method .",
    "the calibration samples ( see fig .  [ 2d - grid ] ) are used to build the matrix @xmath7 and then tested on validation samples .",
    "the number of sampling points determines the size of matrix @xmath4 in eq .",
    "[ eq - dlr ] .",
    "a huge number of samples rapidly makes the calculation of @xmath7 computationally very expensive .",
    "therefore , the _ singular value decomposition _ ( svd ) @xcite method is alternatively applied to reduce the system size by looking for the prominent patterns of matrix @xmath4 in terms of svd modes : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are formed by base vectors , and @xmath11 contains the singular values ( fig .",
    "[ svd - sv ] ) . using only the first twenty svd modes according to their singular values",
    ", one can recover the spectra used for decomposition ( fig .",
    "[ svd - reco ] ) .",
    "then linear regression is applied on the svd amplitude matrix formed by the first twenty svd modes instead of the much larger sized matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ b - bp ] for both the dlr and the svd method .",
    "excellent agreement is attained with measurements for both methods .",
    "this provides confidence that the system can be well represented by a few svd modes .",
    "some modes in the fifth dipole band of the third harmonic cavities have been shown to be localized within each cavity by both simulations and measurements . according to spectra characteristics ,",
    "various techniques are applied and compared : lorentzian fit , dlr and svd .",
    "linear dependence of the mode amplitude on the transverse beam position is observed , comfirming the dipole character of the modes .",
    "these modes are considered in the development of hom electronics for beam diagnostics , along with propagating cavity modes in the first two dipole passbands and localized beampipe modes ."
