    "a meromorphic quadratic differential @xmath0 with at most simple poles on a riemann surface @xmath1 of genus @xmath2 defines a flat metric on @xmath1 with conical singularities .",
    "if @xmath0 is _ not _ the global square of a holomorphic 1-form on @xmath1 , the metric has a non - trivial linear holonomy group , and in this case @xmath3 is called a _ half - translation _ surface . in this paper",
    "we consider only quadratic differentials satisfying the previous condition .",
    "if @xmath4 is a partition of @xmath5 , @xmath6 denotes the moduli space of pairs @xmath3 as above , where @xmath0 has exactly @xmath7 singularities of orders given by @xmath8 .",
    "stratum _ in the moduli space @xmath9 of pairs @xmath3 with no additional constraints on @xmath0 .    in",
    "what follows we will refer to a half - translation surface @xmath3 simply as @xmath1 .",
    "a _ saddle connection _ on @xmath1 is a geodesic segment on @xmath1 joining a pair of conical singularities or a singularity to itself without any singularities in its interior .",
    "note that maximal flat cylinders filled by parallel regular closed geodesics have their boundaries composed by one or several parallel saddle connections . in this paper",
    "we will evaluate the number of such cylinders on @xmath1 in terms of the volumes of some strata , using the study of saddle connections by masur and zorich in @xcite .",
    "a saddle connection persists under any small deformation of @xmath1 inside the stratum @xmath6 .",
    "moreover masur and zorich noticed in @xcite that in some cases any small deformation which shortens a specific saddle connection shortens also some other saddle connections .",
    "more precisely , they give the following result ( proposition 1 of @xcite ) :    let @xmath10 be a collection of saddle connections on a half - translation surface @xmath1 .",
    "then any sufficiently small deformation of @xmath1 inside the stratum preserves the proportions @xmath11 of the lengths of the saddle connections if and only if the saddle connections are omologous .",
    "roughly two saddle connections are omologous if they define the same anti - invariant cycle in the orientation double cover .",
    "the precise definition will be recalled in   [ ssect : hom ] .",
    "in particular two omologous saddle connections are parallel with ratios of lengths equal to @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the geometric types of possible maximal collections of omologous saddle connections @xmath14 on @xmath1 are called _ configurations _ of saddle connections . masur and zorich classified all configurations of saddle connections in @xcite in terms of combinatorial data .",
    "we assume in the sequel that @xmath1 belongs to a connected stratum ( unless the non connectedness is stated explicitly ) , and we will not make a distinction when we speak about configurations for the surface @xmath1 or for the stratum @xmath6 , the second means that we look at all possible configurations on almost every surface @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested in collections of omologous saddle connections , such that some of the saddle connections bound at least one cylinder filled by parallel regular closed geodesics .",
    "we refer to the geometric type of these collections as `` configurations containing cylinders '' or `` configurations with cylinders '' .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that such cylinders have in fact each of their two boundaries composed by exactly one or two saddle connections in the collection , and that if there are several cylinders in the configuration , the lengths of their waist curves are either the same or have the ratio 1:2 .",
    "namely , some cylinders have their width twice larger than the width of the other cylinders . the boundary of the first cylinders",
    "are composed either by one or two saddle connections , and the boundary of the latter cylinders are composed by exactly one saddle connection .",
    "we will refer to cylinders of the first type as `` thick cylinders '' and to cylinders of the second type as `` thin cylinders '' .",
    "we call the length of the minimal saddle connection in the collection or equivalently the width of any thin cylinder the `` length of the configuration '' .",
    "let @xmath16 be a maximal collection of omologous saddle connections on @xmath1 .",
    "then the complimentary region of these saddle connections and the cylinders bounded by these saddle connections is the union of some surfaces with boundaries .",
    "each of them might be obtained by a specific surgery from a flat surface belonging to a stratum @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "the union of these strata @xmath19 is called the _ boundary stratum _ for the configuration @xmath20 .",
    "this distinction is meaningful : the boundary stratum corresponds to the degeneration of the stratum @xmath21 as the lengths of the saddle connections in the collection tend to 0 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a half - translation surface in a connected stratum @xmath6 , and @xmath20 a configuration with cylinders on @xmath1 .",
    "it means that in some given direction , there is a collection of omologous saddle connections of type @xmath20 on @xmath1 .",
    "note that by results of @xcite in many other directions , one can usually find another collection of omologous saddle connections of same type @xmath20 .",
    "we introduce @xmath22 the number of directions on @xmath1 in which we can find a collection of saddle connections of type @xmath20 , with the length of the smallest saddle connection smaller than @xmath23 . since we are interested in cylinders we introduce also @xmath24 that counts each appearance of the configuration @xmath20 with weight equal to the number of the cylinders of width smaller than @xmath25 , and @xmath26 that counts each appearance of the configuration @xmath20 with weight equal to the area of the cylinders of width smaller than @xmath25 .    for each of these numbers ,",
    "we introduce the corresponding siegel ",
    "veech constant , that gives the asymptotic of these numbers as @xmath23 goes to infinity : @xmath27 the stratum @xmath6 is equipped with a natural @xmath28-invariant measure induced by the lebesgue measure in period coordinates . eskin and masur showed in @xcite that the numbers are in fact constant on a full measure set of the stratum @xmath6 . combining these results with the results of veech @xcite ,",
    "one concludes that all these constants are strictly positive .",
    "one of the principal reasons why the siegel ",
    "veech constants are more and more intensively studied during the last years @xcite is the relation between them and the lyapunov exponents of the hodge bundle along the teichmller flow : the key formula of  @xcite expresses the sum of the positive lyapunov exponents for any stratum @xmath6 as a sum of a very explicit rational function in @xmath8 and the siegel  veech constant @xmath29 .",
    "the lyapunov exponents are closely related to the deviation spectrum of measured foliations on individual flat surfaces @xcite , which opens applications to billiards in polygons , interval exchanges , etc .    a recent breakthrough of a.  eskin and m.  mirzakhani provides , in particular , new tools allowing to prove that the @xmath30-orbit closure of certain individual flat surfaces is an entire stratum .",
    "by the theorem of j.  chaika and a.  eskin  @xcite , almost all directions for such a flat surface are lyapunov - generic .",
    "this allows to use all the technology mentioned above to compute , for example , the diffusion rate of billiards with certain periodic obstacles .",
    "the final explicit answer ( as @xmath31 for the diffusion rate in the windtree model studied in  @xcite ) is a certain lyapunov exponent as above .",
    "these kinds of quantitative answers or estimates are often reduced to computation of the appropriate siegel ",
    "veech constants .",
    "the kontsevich formula @xcite for the sum of the lyapunov exponents over a teichmller curve and recent results of s.  filip  @xcite showing that every orbit closure is a quasiprojective variety suggest that an adequate intersection theory of the strata might provide algebro - geometric tools to evaluate siegel  veech constants ( see also  @xcite in this connection ) .",
    "however , such intersection theory is not developed yet , and we are limited to analytic tools in our evaluation of siegel  veech constants .",
    "now we are ready to state the main theorem of this paper .",
    "[ th : ccyl ] let @xmath20 be an admissible configuration for a connected stratum @xmath6 of quadratic differentials .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the number of thin cylinders , @xmath33 the number of thick cylinders in the configuration @xmath20 , and @xmath34 the total number of cylinders .",
    "assume that the boundary stratum @xmath35 is non empty , and @xmath36 .",
    "then the siegel ",
    "veech constants associated to @xmath20 are the following : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 are combinatorial constants depending only on the configuration @xmath20 , explicitly given by equations ( [ eq : m_c ] ) , ( [ eq : m_t ] ) and ( [ eq : m_s ] ) .",
    "when the boundary stratum is empty , the formulas are simpler and given in   [ sssection : specialcase ] .",
    "this theorem is proved in section [ ssection : computation ] .",
    "note that these formulas coincide in genus 0 with the formulas of @xcite , for the two configurations containing cylinders ( named `` pocket '' and `` dumbell '' in the article ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath42 can be interpreted as the mean area of a cylinder in the configuration @xmath20 .",
    "note that it depends only on the dimension of the ambient stratum .    for a fixed stratum @xmath6 consider all admissible configurations , and denote @xmath43 the maximal number of cylinders for all these configurations .",
    "we evaluate this number in section [ ssect : maxcyl ] .",

    "veech constants ( reduced , in turn , to combinations of volumes of the boundary strata ) with numerics provided by experiments with the lyapunov exponents .",
    "these tests are based , in particular , on the results of a.  eskin and a.  okounkov  @xcite providing the explicit values of the volumes of all strata of abelian differentials in small genera .",
    "the description of combinatorial geometry of configurations of saddle connections for the strata of quadratic differentials is performed in the paper of h.  masur and a.  zorich  @xcite ; for the hyperelliptic components and for strata in genus zero such description is given in the paper of c.  boissy  @xcite .",

    "( the authors prove in  @xcite an extremely simple explicit formula for such volumes in genus zero conjectured by m.  kontsevich . )    in the current paper we treat the strata of quadratic differentials in arbitrary genus .",
    "we should point that , in the contrast to the strata of abelian differentials , the analogous results of a.  eskin , a.  okounkov  @xcite , and r.  pandharipande  @xcite do not provide explicit values for the volumes of the strata of quadratic differentials .",
    "this is why in @xcite we have computed the values of volumes of a large amount of strata in low dimension , implementing the algorithm of eskin and okounkov .",
    "these volumes were independently tested in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use these values to obtain some exact values of siegel  veech constants for the strata of quadratic differentials away from genus zero , and to show that our formulas for siegel ",
    "veech constants are consistent with numerics coming from lyapunov exponents of the hodge bundle over the teichmller flow .",
    "furthermore , we have compared all our results with the program polygon of alex eskin , which counts configurations of saddle connections for individual translation surfaces .",
    "the paper is divided into five parts .",
    "the first two sections , theoretical , give the proof of theorem [ th : ccyl ] , and develop the results on a special family of strata : @xmath55 .",
    "for the first strata of this type we compute the exact values of siegel  veech constants and we obtain the exact values of the sums of lyapunov exponents of the hodge bundle along the teichmller flow .",
    "these values are important for applications to billiards , such as windtree models @xcite .",
    "the computations of this first part generalize the computations presented in the articles @xcite , and @xcite , but in higher genus , this theory does not easily yield the exact values of siegel - veech constants , because the techniques involve phenomena of higher complexity .",
    "this is why we present in a second part all explicit computations .",
    "section [ sect : volhyp ] develops the formula in the case of hyperelliptic components of strata .",
    "for these components , the values of the volumes and the siegel ",
    "veech constants are known , which enables us to check the coherence of the formulas in this case .",
    "section [ sect : ex ] is devoted to the application of the main formula for strata of small dimension where we have explicit values of the volumes @xcite .",
    "in particular for non - varying strata we check the coherence of the main formula . in the other cases we get new explicit siegel  veech constants that we can compare with the experimental value of the sum of lyapunov exponents .",
    "this comparison serves as an independent test of coherence of our choice of numerous normalizations and a confirmation that all discrete symmetries of relatively sophisticated configurations are taken into consideration .",

    "a labeling of the zeros and a choice of a covering path of the graph of the configuration induce a labeling of the cylinders .",
    "sometimes some symmetries occur that exchange the cylinders but stabilize the zeros , they are taken into account in  [ sect : count ] . in the following",

    "roughly @xmath202 is described by coordinates @xmath205 representing the width , the heights and the twists of the cylinders , defined such that @xmath206 is the holonomy of the curve @xmath207 .",
    "the problem here is that there might be an ambiguity for the choice of this curve and so for the definition of the twist . in the following",
    "we assume that the cylinders are horizontal , that is @xmath208 represents the horizontal direction in the surface @xmath1 . first note that despite the fact that the surface has a non trivial holonomy , for a given configuration @xmath20 it is possible to choose an orientation for each cylinder , for example by choosing an oriented path covering the graph representing the configuration .",
    "so in each cylinder we have a notion of bottom , up , left and right .",
    "recall that thin cylinders are the one with each of their boundaries formed by a single saddle connection of holonomy @xmath193 , and so there is only one singularity on each of their boundaries .",
    "for these cylinders we can define the twist and the height of the cylinder as usual : starting from the only one singularity on the bottom of the cylinder , draw a vertical segment going up and ending at a point @xmath209 on the upper boundary of the cylinder .",
    "the length of this segment defines the height of the cylinder .",
    "starting from the point @xmath209 and following the boundary in the right horizontal direction , we meet the singularity on the upper boundary of the cylinder , which is at distance @xmath210 from @xmath209 , and @xmath210 defines the twist of the cylinder ( @xmath211 ) . the next picture shows a particular case where the twist is ambiguous for a thick cylinder .        for the thick cylinders , we can define their twist as follows : for such a cylinder , if one of its boundaries contains two distinct singularities ( recall that the singularities are labeled ) , then choose the one of the smaller index .",
    "we have now in each case one distinguished singularity on each of the two boundaries .",
    "consider the shortest geodesic segments joining these two singularities ( there might be two such segments ) .",

    "so we define the twist as the value @xmath221 equal to the horizontal coordinates reduced modulo @xmath213 .",

    "we can reformulate this discussion by saying that there is only one way to get a cone angle @xmath370 : one has to glue a cone angle @xmath371 with a cone angle @xmath372 .",
    "looking carefully at all the ways to have boundary singularities of order 1 or 0 in the local ribbon graphs and the consequence on the boundary components in the global graph , we reduce the case to only two possibilities : the boundary singularity of order 0 arises only as a cone angle around points on the boundary of a cylinder , and the one of order 1 arises either by creating a hole adjacent to a pole in a surface of non trivial holonomy ( i.e. for vertices of type @xmath373 and @xmath374 ) , or by breaking up a marked point on a surface of trivial holonomy ( i.e. for vertices of type @xmath375 ) .",
