    "the caloron correspondence appeared initially in the guise of a bijection between certain isomorphism classes of periodic instantons , or _",
    "calorons _ , on @xmath8 and isomorphism classes of monopoles on @xmath9 .    considering monopoles for loop groups and their twistor theory , garland and murray established in @xcite a correspondence between @xmath10-calorons on @xmath8 and monopoles on @xmath9 with structure group @xmath11 , the frchet lie group of smooth loops in @xmath10 . by virtue of being periodic , a caloron on @xmath8 may be naturally viewed as an instanton on @xmath12 , thus the work of garland and murray may be viewed as establishing a relationship between certain geometric data on @xmath10-bundles over @xmath13 and similar data on @xmath11-bundles on @xmath9 .",
    "the underlying principle of this original _ caloron correspondence_as it was first described by murray and stevenson @xcite  is that , for any compact lie group @xmath0 and manifold @xmath3 , there is a bijective correspondence between @xmath0-bundles over @xmath1 and @xmath14-bundles over @xmath3 , with @xmath2 the frchet lie group of smooth loops in @xmath0 .",
    "this procedure gives a sort of fake dimensional reduction , whereby the circle direction of the @xmath0-bundle @xmath15 is hidden in the fibres to obtain an @xmath2-bundle @xmath16 and vice - versa .",
    "the caloron correspondence may be thought of as the bundle - theoretic generalisation of the following simple observation .",
    "if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are sets , then denoting by @xmath19 the set of all functions @xmath20 , there is a bijection @xmath21 given by sending @xmath22 with @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in the case that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are finite - dimensional manifolds , let @xmath26 be the set of all smooth maps @xmath20 . if @xmath27 is compact then @xmath28 becomes a ( smooth ) frchet manifold .",
    "the map now gives a method by which one may study smooth maps from @xmath29 into the infinite - dimensional manifold @xmath28 by instead studying smooth maps from @xmath30 into @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , in the case that @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the map gives a bijective correspondence between the space of sections of the trivial @xmath0-bundle over @xmath1 and the space of sections of the trivial @xmath2-bundle over @xmath3 . for general (",
    "non - trivial ) @xmath0-bundles , the caloron correspondence is a twisted version of this equivalence .",
    "the caloron correspondence outlined thus far gives a means by which one may more easily study @xmath2-bundles , which are necessarily infinite - dimensional manifolds , by instead studying their finite - dimensional @xmath0-bundle counterparts .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the caloron correspondence may be extended to incorporate geometric data .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that a @xmath0-bundle over @xmath34 equipped with a @xmath0-connection is equivalent to an @xmath2-bundle over @xmath3 equipped with an @xmath2-connection and an extra geometric datum called a _",
    "higgs field _ , which is essentially the component of a connection on a @xmath0-bundle over @xmath1 in the @xmath35 direction .",
    "using this _ geometric _ caloron correspondence together with the machinery of bundle gerbes , murray and stevenson developed a useful generalisation of string classes .",
    "string classes first appeared in the work of killingback @xcite on string structures ; the string theory versions of the spin structures that are important in quantum field theory . taking a compact lie group",
    "@xmath0 one may ask whether a given @xmath2-bundle @xmath16 admits a lifting of the structure group to the kac - moody group @xmath36 , which is a central extension of @xmath2 by @xmath35 ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "the obstruction to such a lift is a class in the degree three integral cohomology of @xmath3 . in the case that @xmath37 is given by taking smooth loops in a @xmath0-bundle @xmath38 , killingback showed that this obstruction is given by transgressing the first pontryagin class @xmath39 of @xmath40 .",
    "thus the _ string class _ is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the evaluation map and @xmath43 denotes integration over the fibre in integral cohomology .",
    "the string class of @xmath44 measures the obstruction to @xmath44 having _ string structure _ ; i.e.  a lifting to an @xmath36-bundle .",
    "string structures are important in string theory because , as the work of killingback shows , the loop bundle @xmath45 has a dirac - ramond operator if and only if @xmath46 has a string structure .",
    "murray and stevenson used the caloron correspondence to extend the work of killingback by first defining the string class for all @xmath2-bundles @xmath16 and showing that it satisfies @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the first pontryagin class of the caloron transform @xmath49 of @xmath44 .",
    "they also showed , using bundle gerbes , that a de rham representative for the string class is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the curvature of a chosen @xmath2-connection on @xmath44 , @xmath52 is the covariant derivative of a chosen higgs field @xmath53 on @xmath44 and @xmath54 is the ( normalised ) killing form .    in his phd thesis @xcite and together with murray in @xcite , vozzo generalised the caloron correspondence to principal bundles with structure group @xmath55 ; the frchet lie group of smooth loops in @xmath0 based at the identity .",
    "the key innovation here is the use of framings to establish a correspondence between @xmath55-bundles over @xmath3 and @xmath0-bundles over @xmath1 equipped with a distinguished section over @xmath56 .",
    "as before , this correspondence generalises to incorporate connective data , which must necessarily be compatible with the framing data on the @xmath0-bundle side .",
    "murray and vozzo also defined ( higher ) string classes , which are characteristic classes for @xmath55-bundles that live in odd integral cohomology . fixing the @xmath55-bundle @xmath16 and choosing an @xmath55-connection @xmath57 and higgs field @xmath53 ,",
    "explicit de rham representatives for these characteristic classes called _ string forms _ are given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an @xmath60-invariant symmetric polynomial on the lie algebra @xmath61 of @xmath0 of degree @xmath62 and @xmath51 , @xmath63 are as above .",
    "if @xmath64 denotes the corresponding connection on the caloron transform @xmath49 of @xmath44 , it turns out that the string forms satisfy @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the chern - weil form associated to @xmath59 and @xmath64 .",
    "the higher string classes give a version of chern - weil theory for loop group bundles different from the more analytic approach of @xcite .",
    "in addition , by considering the path fibration @xmath67 which is a smooth model for the universal @xmath55-bundle , murray and vozzo show that the construction of the higher string classes provides a geometric interpretation of borel s transgression map @xmath68 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this thesis grew out of the attempt to answer a natural question that arises when one contrasts the theory of string classes for loop group bundles to the familiar chern - weil theory . in chern - weil theory ,",
    "differential form representatives for characteristic classes of the @xmath0-bundle @xmath69 are given in terms of the curvature of a chosen connection @xmath64 on @xmath49 .",
    "whilst the characteristic cohomology classes of the bundle @xmath49 are necessarily independent of the choice of @xmath64 , the differential form representatives are not .",
    "there are well - known differential forms , the chern - simons forms introduced in @xcite , that measure the dependence of the chern - weil forms on the choice of connection .",
    "it is natural to ask , therefore , whether such forms exists in the context of loop group bundles and string classes .    the first part of this thesis deals with the construction of the _ string potentials _ , which are the analogues of chern - simons forms for loop group bundles . like chern - simons forms ,",
    "the string potentials come in two different flavours : one has _ relative _ string potentials , which live on the base space of a loop group bundle and encode the dependence of the string forms on the choice of connection and higgs field ; and _ total _ string potentials , which live on the total space and carry secondary geometric data associated to a particular choice of connection and higgs field .    within the framework of the differential characters of cheeger and simons @xcite ,",
    "the total chern - simons forms become _ differential _ characteristic classes ( characteristic classes valued in differential cohomology ) .",
    "this thesis hints at a similar interpretation for the total string potentials by constructing such classes in a limited setting .",
    "the interpretation of the relative string potential forms is more involved and proceeds by analogy with the codification of relative chern - simons forms given by simons and sullivan in @xcite . in that paper , the authors use relative chern - simons forms to define an equivalence relation on the space of connections on a given vector bundle .",
    "the space of isomorphism classes of _ structured vector bundles _ , i.e.  vector bundles equipped with such an equivalence class of connections , determines a functor from the category of compact manifolds with corners to the category of abelian semi - rings . passing to the grothendieck group completion ,",
    "one obtains a multiplicative differential extension of the even - degree part of topological @xmath7-theory . by a result of bunke and schick @xcite",
    "this differential extension , denoted here by @xmath70 , is isomorphic to any other differential extension of even @xmath7-theory via a unique isomorphism .    the simons - sullivan model of even differential @xmath7-theory",
    "is built upon vector bundles rather than principal bundles , since the even topological @xmath7-theory of a compact manifold @xmath3 has a natural construction in terms of vector bundles over @xmath3 .",
    "topological @xmath7-theory is a generalised cohomology theory and as such has a ` homotopy - invariant ' representation as homotopy classes of maps into a spectrum @xmath71 . by the well - known bott periodicity theorem",
    "this spectrum is @xmath72-periodic and in fact @xmath73\\;\\;\\mbox { and } \\;\\ ;",
    "k^{-1}(m ) \\cong [ m , u],\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the stabilised unitary group and @xmath75 is its classifying space . using this representation , it is clear why even @xmath7-theory @xmath76 may be represented by vector bundles over @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , as @xmath3 is taken to be a smooth manifold , one may define @xmath76 using only smooth vector bundles .",
    "the odd @xmath7-theory of @xmath3 is a little more subtle and is usually defined in terms of vector bundles over @xmath77 , the reduced suspension of @xmath78 .",
    "this is problematic when attempting to construct a differential extension after the fashion of simons - sullivan as @xmath77 is rarely a smooth manifold so it is not clear how to incorporate differential form data .",
    "the homotopy - theoretic model for @xmath79 gives a clue as to how to resolve this issue : by pulling back the path fibration @xmath80 one may construct odd @xmath7-theory using @xmath81-bundles , or rather their associated vector bundles , over @xmath3 .",
    "the benefits of this are two - fold since the building blocks of the theory are bundles over @xmath3 that may additionally be taken to be smooth without loss of generality .",
    "the latter part of this thesis introduces @xmath6 vector bundles , which are the associated vector bundles of @xmath82- and @xmath5-bundles . as with their frame bundles",
    ", there is a caloron correspondence for @xmath6 vector bundles that may be extended to incorporate the appropriate connective data . a model for odd topological @xmath7-theory",
    "is given in terms of @xmath6 vector bundles and the odd chern character is computed in this model in terms of characteristic classes of the underlying @xmath6 vector bundles . using the relative string potentials to define an equivalence relation on connective data ,",
    "this model is refined to give a differential extension of odd @xmath7-theory : the @xmath6 model .",
    "using the work of bunke and schick @xcite and tradler , wilson and zeinalian @xcite it is shown that the @xmath6 model is isomorphic to the odd part of differential @xmath7-theory , thereby giving the desired codification of relative string potentials .",

    "this construction uses the relative string potential forms to generate an equivalence relation on the space of module connections and higgs fields of a given @xmath6 vector bundle , an equivalence class of which is called a _ string datum_. the @xmath6 model is given by applying the grothendieck group completion device to the abelian semi - group of ( a certain collection of ) isomorphism classes of _ structured @xmath6 vector bundles _ ; @xmath6 vector bundles equipped with string data .",
