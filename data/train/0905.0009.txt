    "spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) is a nonlinear process in which a pump photon interacting with a crystal decays into two daughter photons .",
    "the process has been successfully employed to demonstrate fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics such as the violation of bell s inequalities @xcite , and utilized in implementations of quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , linear optical quantum information processing @xcite , and other quantum - enhanced technologies .",
    "typically , photon pairs emerging from non - linear media are described by a complicated spatio - temporal wave function that exhibits correlations in multiple degrees of freedom .",
    "in contrast , many applications of photon pairs require their preparation in single isolated spatio - temporal modes .",
    "single spatial modes can be selected by coupling photons into single - mode fibers ( smfs ) that in effect filter heavily the spdc light .",
    "furthermore , many protocols rely on interference between photons originating from independent sources @xcite .",
    "although spatial modes are well defined by smfs , the interference visibility may be compromised by undesirable spectral correlations within individual pairs .",
    "one way to tailor the spectral degree of freedom is to use narrowband interference filters , which is easy to implement in an experiment , but in consequence reduces the useful photon flux .",
    "an alternative approach is to adjust the setup parameters to enforce the source to produce spectrally uncorrelated pairs @xcite .",
    "these issues bring the question of optimizing the useful fraction of photon pairs produced by spdc sources .",
    "a purely experimental approach would be just to try various alignments of the source . in practice",
    ", this strategy would be rather burdensome owing to the large number of controllable parameters of the setup , their time - consuming adjustments , and long data acquisition times .",
    "a natural alternative is to resort to numerical modeling .",
    "this however presents its own challenges , as including all relevant degrees of freedom is computationally demanding .    in this paper we discuss approximate methods that alleviate the numerical load necessary to model faithfully realistic spdc sources .",
    "our approach is based on an observation that optical fibers collecting photons define a relatively narrow range of wave vectors that need to be included in calculations .",
    "this justifies applying the paraxial approximation , which makes a substantial portion of the problem tractable analytically .",
    "the paraxial approximation can be also combined with a simplification of the two - photon wave function to an analytically manageable form leading to closed formulas .",
    "we exploit these strategies to analyze the performance of spdc sources in quantum information applications .",
    "coupling of down - converted photons into smfs has been a subject of a number of works , especially in the case of cw pumping .",

    "we consider here two strategies to reduce spectral correlation : one method is to adjust carefully the pump pulse and collection modes , while the other one is to restrict the spectrum of the generated photons with the help of interference filters .",
