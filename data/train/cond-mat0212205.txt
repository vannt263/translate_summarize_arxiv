    "we determine the actual phase boundary by comparing the energy between the symmetric phase and the asymmetric phase and find that the actual phase boundary and the instability boundary is not the same .",
    "this suggests that the transition is first order .",
    "the system may be a good laboratory to study issues of quantum metastability and tunnelling .",

    "theoretical treatment of such systems began in the context of superfluid helium mixtures @xcite and spin - polarized hydrogen @xcite , and now has been extended to bec in trapped gases @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium density distributions of segregated mixtures in the absence of gravity have been studied numerically for different system parameters .",
    "two types of configurations have been discussed : a symmetric  @xcite configuration , for which one component is inside the other one , and an asymmetric one in which the two components occupy the left and the right hand side of a sphere  @xcite .",

    "one can make the initial configuration unstable by manipulating the ratio @xmath3 close to one , e.g. , by means of feschbach resonances or by changing the ratio of the trapping frequencies . in this paper",

    "effect of the interface tension results in a shift of the transition point of the symmetric - asymmetric transition in the two component bec . in general ,",
    "the asymmetric phase possesses a lower interface energy . on the other hand , since the degree of self - repulsion may differ between the two species , the less self - repulsive component will prefer to remain where the density is higher , while the other component moves to the low density regions outside .",
