    "the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr ) , discovered only a decade ago @xcite , is the most compelling example of a satellite currently being cannibalized by the milky way .",
    "there have been numerous studies reporting the discovery of stars and star clusters plausibly associated with debris from this satellite , either trailing or leading it along its orbit ( see majewski et al .",
    "2003  hereafter `` paper i ''  for a comprehensive summary ) . using a study of faint , high - latitude carbon stars for which a significant overdensity was found to be aligned in angular position with the projection of sgr s orbit , totten & irwin ( 1998 )",
    "were the first to present data that suggested that the tidal tails of the disrupting sgr system extend a full @xmath5 across the sky .",
    "the conclusions of the carbon star study were recently dramatically verified using m giants selected from the 2mass database ( paper i ) .",
    "because sgr is relatively metal - rich , m giant stars are prevalent in its debris stream , are far more common than carbon stars , and can be easily identified to distances of more than 50 kpc within the 2mass database . moreover , the large sample of m giants in the core of sgr itself permits a much more reliable distance scale to be derived for these stars than is possible for the carbon stars . as a result , for the first time , primary leading and trailing tidal arms can clearly be traced using the 2mass m giants , with the trailing tail spanning at least 150@xmath6 across the southern galactic hemisphere and the leading tail arcing up to create a rosette orbital loop in the northern galactic hemisphere .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of sgr - candidate stars has determined line - of - sight ( i.e. `` radial '' ) velocities for sgr m giant stars throughout the trailing tail ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter  paper ii  ) , and work on stars in the leading trail is in progress ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter  paper v  ) .    a number of groups have sought to model the sgr  milky way interaction ( e.g. johnston , spergel , & hernquist 1995 , velazquez & white 1995 , ibata et al .",

    "the interaction of the sgr dwarf spheroidal with the milky way offers a sensitive probe of the shape and strength of the galactic potential , and also provides a nearby laboratory for exploring the internal dynamics of satellite galaxies under the strong tidal influence of a parent system .",
    "ibata & lewis ( 1998 ) made an extensive series of simulations to match data available at the time . among their models ,",
    "model k6-a provides the closest match to the general morphology of the sgr tidal tails as mapped by m giant stars selected from 2mass .",
    "however , the 2mass m giant work represents such a substantial increase in our knowledge of the phase - space distribution of sgr debris that a new study of the system fully constrained by these data is warranted .",
    "recently , a controversy has begun to develop over the oblate / prolate nature of the galactic halo as measured using sgr tidal debris .",
    "helmi ( 2004 ) has presented evidence in favor of a prolate ( @xmath1 1.25 ) halo using sgr leading debris velocity trends , while in a companion paper ( johnston , law , & majewski 2004 , hereafter `` paper iii '' ) we have demonstrated that such prolate halos fail to reproduce the observed orbital pole precession of leading vs. trailing debris , for which oblate ( @xmath1 0.90 ) halos best reproduce observational data . in earlier studies , @xcite and @xcite determined that values of @xmath7 1.0 and @xmath1 0.85 respectively best fit the available data . in this paper",
    ", we explore whether it is possible to resolve this conflict using a single - component ( i.e. mass - follows - light ) model for sgr , traveling along a single orbit in a non - evolving potential .",
    "we present the results of numerical simulations to find the best fit to the measured positions and velocities of the m giants presented in papers i , ii , and v ( preliminary results have been presented in law et al .",
    "2004 ) while allowing orbital , potential and sgr internal parameters to vary .",
    "our aim is to constrain the current mass and orbit of sgr as tightly as possible as a precursor to further studies in which higher order effects ( such as multi - component models for sgr travelling along evolving orbits ) are also accounted for .    in  2",
    "we describe our simulation technique , and outline the properties of the observed tails that will be used to constrain the simulations . in  3.1 we use simple test particle simulations to examine what range of galactic and orbital parameters could be consistent with sgr debris . in ",
    "3.2 we use the results from full n - body simulations of satellite destruction along viable orbits in the chosen galactic potentials to more tightly constrain the mass and orbit of sgr . in ",
    "4 we compare our results to previous observational and numerical work and assess possible evolution of the sgr orbit , and in  5 we summarize our conclusions .",
    "our simulation technique closely follows that outlined in @xcite .",
    "the milky way is represented by a smooth , rigid potential , and sgr by a collection of @xmath8 self - gravitating particles whose mutual interactions are calculated using a self - consistent field code ( hernquist & ostriker 1992 ) .",
    "a three - component model is used for the galactic potential and consists of a miyamoto - nagai ( 1975 ) disk , hernquist spheroid , and a logarithmic halo : @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 following johnston et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we take @xmath12 @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath13 , @xmath15 kpc , @xmath16 kpc and @xmath17 kpc . in ",
    "3.1 we investigate how different choices @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 kpc and @xmath21 km s@xmath22 ( the circular speed at the solar circle  @xmath23 in eqn .",
    "[ haloeqn ] was chosen to match @xmath24 for a given bulge and disk contribution and adopted @xmath25 ) affect our fit to the debris data .",
    "initially , the particles in our model of sgr are distributed to generate a plummer ( 1911 ) model @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the initial mass of sgr and @xmath28 is its scale length .",
    "these particles represent both the dark and light matter components of the satellite . we do not attempt to generate a more specific two - component model that matches sgr s internal density and velocity distribution since both will evolve during the simulation .",
    "rather , we explore to what extent sgr s debris can constrain the present global characteristics of the satellite .",
    "these global characteristics can then be used in a more careful consideration of the core structure in future work when better data on the core are available .      in this paper",
    "we use the spherical , sun - centered , sgr - coordinate systemsrm4n / sgr/ ] defined in paper i , since this is the coordinate system in which satellite debris is observed and therefore can be compared to simulations most clearly .",
    "the zero - plane of the latitude coordinate @xmath29 coincides with the best - fit great circle defined by sgr debris , as seen from the sun .",
    "the longitudinal coordinate @xmath30 is zero in the direction of the sgr core and increases along the sgr trailing debris stream , i.e. away from the galactic plane .",
    "figure [ xydiag ] shows a representative n - body simulation of the sgr dwarf in cartesian @xmath31 , @xmath32 coordinates ( see paper i for the definition of the sgr , gc and sgr,@xmath33 coordinate systems ) , and illustrates the orientation of the spherical coordinate system with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "the colors of the simulated data used in this and other figures in this paper represent different debris `` eras '' , i.e. orbits ( denoted as one apogalacticon to the next apogalacticon ) on which the debris was stripped from the satellite .",
    "yellow points represent debris stripped from the satellite since apogalacticon about 0.5 gyr ago , while magenta , cyan , and green points represent debris stripped from the dwarf 2 , 3 , and 4 orbits ago respectively . note that while each color represents debris unbound from the satellite between two successive apogalactic passages , the majority of debris of each color is released during the corresponding perigalactic passage .",
    "this color scheme allows us to discriminate readily between different wraps of tidal debris , and is also useful for determining the expected age of debris at any given point along the tidal stream .    the observed position and radial velocity data for",
    "sgr m giants ( papers i , ii , and v ) provide strong constraints on the orbit of the sgr dwarf .",
    "most other sgr detections around the sky fall within the m giant - traced tails ( see fig .",
    "17 of paper i ) ; therefore we compare our models to the m giants alone because they offer the most consistent , wide - ranging map of sgr debris , and at the same time encompass the previous detections .",
    "we compare our results to the recently announced sdss detections @xcite in  4.1 .",
    "we define eleven observed properties that we adopt as constraints on our simulated milky way  sgr system :    1",
    ".   the model sgr dwarf should be located at @xmath34 ( paper i ) .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity of the model dwarf should be @xmath35 171 km s@xmath22 ( ibata et al . 1997 ) .",
    "sgr debris should be aligned with the plane passing through the sun having a pole @xmath36 ( paper i ) .",
    "4 .   the average heliocentric distance for sgr leading debris at apogalacticon ( @xmath37 ) in the northern galactic hemisphere should be 42 @xmath38/24 kpc ) kpc , where @xmath39 is the assumed distance to sgr ( which sets the distance scale of the m giants and is taken to be 24 kpc in paper i ) .",
    "radial velocities along the trailing stream from @xmath40 - @xmath41 should match data presented in paper ii .",
    "radial velocities along the leading stream from @xmath42 - @xmath43 should match data presented in paper v. 7 .",
    "the leading and trailing debris tails should define two distinct planes with poles offset from each other by @xmath44 10 degrees ( paper iii ) .",
    "the physical width of the trailing debris stream perpendicular to the orbital plane should be consistent with m giant observations ( i.e. have a projected spatial dispersion @xmath45 kpc ) .",
    "the average radial velocity dispersion along the trailing stream from @xmath40 - @xmath46 should match the dispersion found for m giants in paper ii ( @xmath47 = 10.0 km s@xmath22 ) .",
    "the model debris to which the m giant data are matched should be younger ( i.e. have left sgr more recently ) than a typical sgr m giant age ( 2 - 3 gyr ; see paper i ) . 11 .",
    "there should be a break in the surface density of trailing debris at @xmath48 , which has previously been interpreted ( mateo et al .",
    "1998 , paper i ) to correspond to the transition between debris lost on the current pericentric passage and that lost on the previous passage .",
    "table [ param.table ] outlines the galactic and satellite parameters varied to produce a model that fits the constraints detailed above . rather than run lengthy n - body simulations to randomly search for a global minimum in this degenerate , multi - dimensional parameter space ( 8 of which",
    "are allowed to vary ) , a more efficient , multi - step approach was taken to converge to the best fit to the observational data , relying on physical insight gained both from analytical descriptions of debris dispersal ( tremaine 1993 , johnston 1998 , helmi & white 1999 , johnston , sackett & bullock 2001 ) and from previous modeling of sgr by the authors ( johnston , spergel , & hernquist 1995 , johnston et al .",

    "these studies have found that while there is a systematic distance offset for leading / trailing debris inside / outside the orbit of the sgr dwarf ( a reflection of the debris moving to more / less tightly bound orbits  see fig .",
    "[ xydiag ] ) the line - of - sight velocity remains approximately aligned with that of the satellite s orbit at all orbital phases . hence in  3.1 below we are able to eliminate a wide range of orbits in a variety of galactic potentials through test - particle integrations alone : we use constraint 4 as an upper limit on a possible orbit s apocentric distance and examine how well the line - of - sight velocities along the orbit match the data in constraints 5 and 6 .",
    "this technique allows us to find reasonable values for all of the free parameters listed in table [ param.table ] except for sgr s current mass . in ",
    "3.2 we describe full - scale simulations of the destruction run for satellites of various masses along the orbits and in the potentials selected in  3.1 .",
    "we assume sgr s current angular position , line - of - sight velocity and direction of proper motion to be fixed by constraints 1 , 2 and 3 respectively , and adopt an amplitude for the motion of sgr perpendicular to our line - of - sight ( @xmath49 ) somewhere within @xmath50 times the error bars on the @xcite measurement of @xmath51 km s@xmath22 . the sgr velocity and position relative to the sun are then tranformed to galactocentric coordinates to provide initial conditions for the test particle orbits , assuming some values for the solar distance from the galactic center ( @xmath52 ) and from sgr ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "( note that changing @xmath39 from the assumed value of 24 kpc scales the distances to all of the sgr m giants by the same fractional amount , since these distances are estimated from a color - apparent magnitude relation derived from m giants in sgr s core  paper i ) .",
    "these orbits are then integrated backwards and forwards in time in the chosen galactic potential ( see  3.1.2 ) and the quality of fit of the orbital path to the m giant position and velocity data quantified ( as described in  3.1.3 ) .",
    "we anticipate that sgr s debris will tell us something about the contours of the gravitational potential in the region that its orbit explores ( @xmath44 10 - 50 kpc ) . hence we do not vary all parameters in equations ( 1 ) - ( [ haloeqn ] ) , but instead hold the bulge component fixed and explore the effect of changing the contribution of the disk to the rotation curve through the parameter @xmath53 , as well as the radial length scale , flattening , and overall depth of the halo potential respectively through the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath54 and @xmath24 . as a final check on the generality of our results , we repeat our experiments with the halo component replaced by models of the form proposed by @xcite  hereafter referred to as nfw models . in this case , the flattening is introduced in the density @xmath55 , rather than potential contours , and the approximate form of the potential is adopted from @xcite . to explore a similar effective range in @xmath54 and radial gradient as the logarithmic models , @xmath55 and @xmath25 ( the length scale of the nfw potential ) are chosen from a wider range than for their logarithmic counterparts",
    " in particular , the range @xmath56 kpc was explored because this encompasses the range of scale lengths ( of order tens of kpc ) found for dark matter halos of similar mass - scale to the milky way in cosmological models of structure formation at the current epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the mass scale of the nfw potential is then constrained to match the adopted @xmath24 .",
    "a guideline for assessing the goodness of fit of an orbit to the positional data is that the maximum heliocentric distance observed for the leading debris ( @xmath57 , constraint 4 ) must be systematically less than that of the orbit of the sgr core , @xmath58  i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "we can also find an upper limit to this ratio since we expect the size of this offset to scale as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the mass of the milky way enclosed within the pericenter of the orbit @xcite .",
    "for example , if we take this limit as @xmath62 then we might expect to cover all models with @xmath63  i.e. sgr masses up to 10% of the mass of the milky way .",
    "since the internal dispersion measured for sgr ( 11 km s@xmath22 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests a mass far less than this we take @xmath64 as a generous range for considering an orbit apogalacticon distance acceptable .",
    "orbits with apogalactica outside this range are immediately rejected .",
    "we next quantify the fit of orbits that are not already rejected to the trailing and leading velocity data ( constraints 5 and 6 ) through the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 : @xmath67_i^2\\over{\\sigma^2_{\\rm a } } } \\label{khia}\\ ] ] where `` a '' represents the observed data set being considered ( i.e. `` lead '' or `` trail '' ) , @xmath68 is the number of m giants in the data set , @xmath69 is the velocity of an m giant at @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the velocity of the orbit at this @xmath70 .",
    "the data compared to in the leading portion of the debris are selected by fitting a 3rd order polynomial to the full data set of velocities as a function of @xmath30 in the range @xmath72 .",
    "outliers from the main trend are thrown out using a 2.5-@xmath73 iterative rejection technique until convergence is reached and the weight @xmath74 calculated as the dispersion of the velocities of this final set of @xmath75 stars about the best - fit polynomials .",
    "the process is then repeated for stars in the region @xmath76 most sensitive to the trailing debris .",
    "the selected stars in both regions are plotted as black squares in figure [ orb.fig ] .",
    "clearly , these data sets are not intended to represent a complete sample of sgr stars , but rather as a guide to the general trends of velocities and dispersion in these regions .",
    "we also express these quantities as a single parameter to measure the combined goodness - of - fit : @xmath77    note that since test particle orbits only serve as an indication of where the debris should lie , we do not simply search for the parameters corresponding to the minima of these quantities : for example , we do not consider a difference of order @xmath78 ( corresponding to average systematic offsets @xmath79 km s@xmath22  very much less than the dispersion in the data ) between the fit to two different orbits to be very significant . rather , we use more extreme differences to rule out or favor broad regions of parameter space .      although the velocity trends in the leading debris ( constraint 6 ) appear to strongly favor galactic models with prolate ( @xmath80 ) halo components @xcite , we have shown in paper iii that the direction of the precession of debris orbits ( as measured by the offset in the poles of best - fit planes to leading and trailing debris  constraint 7 ) strongly favors models with oblate halos since prolate models induce precession in the _ opposite _ sense to that observed . because no other adjustment to the potential can change the fundamental sense of precession in prolate _ vs _ oblate potentials , we restrict ourselves to asking whether we can resolve this contradiction between the implications of constraint 6 and constraint 7 by revisiting the fit to the velocity and distance data alone over a much wider range of parameter space than has been considered previously .",
    "the aim is to examine whether there are any circumstances in which an orbit in an oblate potential can be found that can fit all the constraints at once .",
    "figure [ khi.fig ] plots the minimum values of @xmath65 ( solid lines ) , @xmath66 ( dotted lines ) and @xmath81 ( dashed lines ) obtained as a function of @xmath54 ( left hand panel , logarithmic halo model ) or @xmath82 ( right hand panel , nfw halo model ) when all other parameters are allowed to vary freely within the ranges outlined in table [ param.table ] .",
    "the solid lines show that the trailing velocity data have a slight preference for models with oblate halos , although the difference @xmath83 between the minima for models with @xmath84 and @xmath80 is not sufficiently large that we can confidently rule out prolate models with test particle orbits alone , since it corresponds to a velocity offset much less than the dispersion in the data . in contrast , the dotted lines show that leading velocity data strongly prefer prolate halo models , to such an extent that this preference dominates the combined @xmath81 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "these results are the same for the logarithmic and nfw models .",
    "overall , we conclude that we can not find a single orbit in a static potential model that simultaneously fits the velocity data in the trailing data together with the sense of precession suggested by the offset of the planes of the leading _ vs _ trailing data .",
    "the exciting implication of the conclusion of the previous section  that no _ single _ orbit and/or potential can fit all the data  is that some evolution of sgr s orbit has occurred over the time since debris in the leading portion of the streamer , furthest in @xmath85 from sgr , was released .",
    "we discuss some possible culprits for this orbital evolution in  4.3 , but defer a detailed investigation of these effects for future work . for the remainder of this study",
    ", we narrow our present analysis to concentrate on the younger portions of the debris , lost within the last 1 - 2 orbits , where ( 1 ) the effect of orbit evolution is negligible , ( 2 ) the modelling can be acheived with the fewest free parameters , and ( 3 ) the interpretation of the data is less ambiguous .",
    "the goal is to ask what the younger debris alone can tell us about the galactic potential and sgr s current mass and orbit .",
    "these results can subsequently be used as starting points for studies that use the older debris to examine higher order effects such as orbital evolution , evolution of the potential , and/or multi - component models for sgr .",
    "we expect debris in the trailing streamer in the range explored by the velocity data to be roughly the same age as that in the early parts of the leading streamer to about the first apocenter ( as demonstrated by * ? ? ?",
    "* and see also  3.2 below ) . in these regions , the velocity data can be similarly fit by both oblate and prolate potentials ( as demonstrated by the solid lines in figure [ khi.fig ] ) , and there is no significant offset in the orbital poles between the leading and trailing components .",
    "hence , we now drop constraints 6 and 7 on our models since these were derived from regions where orbit evolution could be significant .",
    "we continue our discussion of test - particle constraints on the galactic potential and our position relative to the galactic center and sgr using the condition @xmath86 and examining @xmath65 alone .    in order to sort through our large parameter space ,",
    "we first look at parameters that do not appear to be strongly constrained by the data and fix reasonable values for those ( see discussion in a. and b. below ) before going on to look at preferred ranges for the remaining parameters ( in c. ) .    in the upper left hand panels of figures [ ktrail_log.fig ] ( for logarithmic halo experiments ) and",
    "[ ktrail_nfw.fig ] ( for nfw halo experiments ) we project results in our 7-dimensional parameter space onto the 2-dimensions of @xmath39 and @xmath87 by plotting the minimum value of @xmath65 at each point in this plane when all other parameters are allowed to vary freely .",
    "the plots reveals a preference for larger values of the ratio @xmath88 , with the absolute scale ( as set by @xmath39 ) being arbitrary . for consistency with",
    "the distance scales adopted earlier in paper i we choose to take @xmath89 kpc ( which also lies within the 2-@xmath73 error bars of the recent measurement by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and set @xmath90 kpc .",
    "so long as @xmath91 we expect all subsequent results involving distances ( e.g. scale - length of the halo @xmath25 , or predicted distances to debris ) can be scaled by whatever value @xmath39 is assumed in a given study .    with @xmath89 kpc and @xmath90 kpc fixed , the upper right hand panels of figures [ ktrail_log.fig ] and [ ktrail_nfw.fig ] project the remaining five - dimensions of parameter space onto the @xmath24 - @xmath53 plane . for high enough @xmath24",
    "there is no preference for a particular @xmath53 , but models with lower @xmath24 are inconsistent with heavier galactic disks ( i.e. higher @xmath53 ) .",
    "figure [ rot.fig ] offers some clue as to why this is the case by plotting rotation curves for only those potentials in which orbits with @xmath92 could be found .",
    "these are very flat out to large radii for all models , with circular velocities at 50 kpc in the range 180 - 220 km s@xmath22 ( which corresponds to enclosed masses for the milky way at these radii of @xmath93  in effect , sgr debris velocities are now providing additional evidence for the existence of a dark matter halo to the milky way ) .",
    "if enough of the contribution @xmath94 is provided by the disk , then the remaining halo component is simply not massive enough to support such an extended flat rotation curve .",
    "( larger mass halos could be built by allowing @xmath25 an even wider range , but these models would [ i ] have rising rotation curves at the solar circle ; and [ ii ] be inconsistent with scale lengths measured for milky way - sized dark matter halos formed in cosmological models of structure formation  see eke , navarro & steinmetz , 2001 ) .",
    "since no values of @xmath53 and @xmath24 are at this point clearly preferred , we adopt @xmath95 and @xmath96 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the colored lines in the lower panels of figures [ ktrail_log.fig ] and [ ktrail_nfw.fig ] demonstrate that , with @xmath90 kpc , @xmath89 kpc , @xmath97 and @xmath96 km s@xmath22 fixed , particular values for @xmath25 ( which determines the radial gradient of the potential and hence the shape of the rotation curve ) and @xmath49 ( which determines the scale of the orbit within this potential ) are quite strongly preferred , with only a mild dependence on @xmath54 .",
    "hence we perform full n - body simulations in potentials with logarithmic halos in which @xmath98 , @xmath99 kpc ( from the minima in the lower left hand panels ) and @xmath49 in the range @xmath100 km s@xmath22 around @xmath101 km s@xmath22 .",
    "all three values , @xmath98 , are considered since all represent equally viable fits to the younger debris",
    ".    clearly , our choices are not unique .",
    "the black curves in the lower panels of figures [ ktrail_log.fig ] and [ ktrail_nfw.fig ] outline where the colored lines would fall if all other parameter choices were the same but @xmath102 km s@xmath22 ( dashed lines ) or @xmath103 ( dotted lines ) . in both cases , the scale - length changes significantly in order to maintain the necessary flatness of the rotation curve , and @xmath49 is similarly affected .",
    "in addition , our decision to use logarithmic halos rather than nfw halos is arbitrary , since figures [ ktrail_log.fig ] and [ ktrail_nfw.fig ] reveal no preference for either form of the potential , but rather more generally indicate that any model that generates a flat rotation curve out to 50 kpc will suffice .",
    "we anticipate that data exploring even larger distances from the galactic center will be able to address whether an nfw ( with a falling rotation curve in this region ) or logarithmic potential is more appropriate .    despite these multiple minima in parameter space ,",
    "we are able to reach some general conclusions at this point : ( i ) sgr debris data prefers models with large values of @xmath88 and flat rotation curves out to 50 kpc , and ( ii ) with all other parameters fixed , sgr orbits in prolate halos will have systematically lower @xmath49 than in spherical or oblate halos .",
    "these conclusions offer a tantalizing glimpse of how sgr debris might be used to map out the galactic potential on large scales once parameters such as @xmath52 and @xmath49 are known with more certainty .      using the galactic parameters determined in  3.1 above",
    ", we now perform fully self - consistent n - body simulations to refine the estimates obtained in  3.1 of sgr s orbital velocity and to determine the mass of the dwarf .",
    "these simulations follow the evolution of satellites with a range of initial masses and physical scales ( varied through the parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 in equation [ [ plummereqn ] ] ) along a small range of plausible orbits within the three models of the galactic potential ( @xmath1 0.9/1.0/1.25 ) discussed in  3.1.5c .    in  3.2.1",
    "we find the mass of sgr ( independent of @xmath105 ) that best fits constraints 8 and 9 in each of these three models of the galactic potential , and demonstrate that this best - fit mass is common to all three cases . fixing the satellite mass to this best - fit value , we refine our estimate for sgr s tangential velocity using constraints 4 and 5 in  3.2.2 and summarize the properties of our best - fit models in  3.2.3 .",
    "while we do not attempt to model the sgr core in detail , we are nonetheless able to constrain its current total mass under the assumptions that the dwarf is roughly spherical and non - rotating .",
    "motivated by previous work ( e.g. , johnston , hernquist , & bolte 1996 , johnston 1998 ) we expect that debris width ( constraint 8) and velocity dispersion ( constraint 9 ) at a given orbital phase primarily reflect the mass within the tidal radius of the satellite on the orbit immediately prior to that debris becoming unbound , and that they do not depend strongly on the internal structure of the satellite ( in our case parameterized by the scale length of the initial plummer model ) . for the same reasons , we do not expect that our results are strongly sensitive to the particle distribution we have adopted .",

    "2004 ) . with the 2mass database it is possible to measure the apogalacticon of leading tidal debris directly , and we match this constraint best by using models for sgr that have orbits with perigalacticon and apogalacticon distances of 10 - 16/14/14 - 19 kpc and 56 - 58/59/56 - 59 kpc respectively .",

    "perhaps foremost is the @xmath149 component of the galactic @xmath134 velocity of the sgr dwarf . some simulations ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "1997 ) have simply set @xmath150 km s@xmath22 ( thereby assuming a polar orbit ) since this component was so poorly known .",
    "now that we have an accurate measurement of sgr s orbital pole ( paper i ) , we are able to predict the direction of its motion more precisely . based on our best - fit model , we predict that the proper motion of the sgr dwarf should be @xmath151 mas yr@xmath22 and @xmath152 mas yr@xmath22 in the solar rest frame km s@xmath22 relative to the lsr , for which we adopt a rotation velocity of 220 km s@xmath22 (  3.1.5b ) . ] .",
    "the direction of this proper motion prediction ( @xmath153 ) is expected to be fairly robust within potentials with each choice of @xmath54 . however , the amplitude of the proper motion will depend on the exact form of the galactic potential , and hence should be revised once other fundamental galactic parameters such as @xmath52 and @xmath24 are known more precisely .",
    "conversely , as more accurate measurements of sgr s proper motion become available it will be possible to refine constraints on the galactic rotation curve .    a second area of debate concerns the present bound mass of the sgr dwarf , for which estimates range from @xmath154 ( mart ' inez - delgado et al .",

    "( 2004 ) predict leading debris at @xmath160 ( corresponding to @xmath161 ) to be composed of stars which have been unbound from the satellite for 5 gyr or more ( since debris from lower - mass satellites takes longer to spread along the orbit ) , in contrast to the roughly 2 gyr found by our own analysis .",
    "as demonstrated in figure [ simplot1 ] , the sgr m giants  which have an estimated age of 2 - 3 gyr  are visible to at least this point in the leading tidal stream . as mart ' inez - delgado et al .",
    "( 2004 ) point out ( and we discuss in paper i ) , stellar populations formed in the densest central regions of the satellite should not be immediately reflected in the tidal streams , and it will take some time for these stars to be present in any quantity in the outer regions of the satellite .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that the m giant population became mixed into the outer regions of sgr within a small fraction of a gyr , and we consider the mean age estimate of 5 gyr for this section of the tidal stream to be too high .",
    "in paper iii we showed that only galactic potentials with oblate halos could reproduce the precession of the orbital plane apparent in the leading _ vs _ trailing data sets .",

    "we explore a much wider variety of galactic potentials than has been considered previously but fail to find a single orbit that can fit both the velocity trends and sense of precession .",
    "our conclusion is that the assumption of non - evolution of the orbit over the time - period that the debris explores is incorrect .",
    "since simulated debris in the region with troublesome velocities is cyan and green ( lost 2 and 3 orbits ago respectively ) , we estimate the timescale over which the evolution has taken place to be @xmath162 gyrs .",
    "we can get some idea of the physical scale of the evolution necessary by looking at the difference between the orbits in prolate , spherical and oblate potentials that is responsible for the difference in the velocity trend .",
    "figure [ orbxz.fig ] plots the orbits shown in figure [ orb.fig ] in galactic coordinates with the region corresponding to the leading debris velocity data shown as bold along each curve .",
    "as the potential moves from prolate to oblate , the orbit passes progressively nearer the sun and line - of - sight velocities more closely reflect the full motion along the orbit .",
    "this explains why the simulated line of sight velocities in this region become more extreme with the oblateness of the potential .",
    "figure [ orbxz.fig ] also suggests that observed debris velocities in the leading region might be accounted for even in an oblate or spherical potential if the pericenter of sgr s orbit has decreased by a factor of order unity within the last 2 - 3 gyrs ( from visual inspection of the figure ) since such a decrease in pericenter of the sgr _ dwarf _ over time could shift older sgr _ debris _ out to greater distances from the sun corresponding to the greater pericenter of the dwarf on the passage on which the debris became unbound .",
    "three factors could contribute to this evolution :    an encounter with a large lump in the milky way potential , either dark or luminous ( e.g. such as the large magellanic cloud , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a full description of this idea ) : we consider this unlikley since we would expect the signature of such an event to be a sudden change in sgr s orbit , and a corresponding sudden change in the velocities along its debris , rather than the smooth trends seen .",
    "global evolution of the galactic potential : we also consider this unlikely since : ( i ) the evolution would have to be very large in order to bring the pericenter inwards by a factor of two in such a short amount of time ; and ( ii ) any global evolution would affect both sgr s and the debris orbits similarly .",
    "dynamical friction : if we re - arrange equation [ 7 - 27 ] from @xcite we can find the mass necessary @xmath163 for a circular orbit at @xmath164 kpc ( i.e. to represent an orbit with of order unity larger pericenter than sgr today ) to decay to the center of the galaxy over a time period @xmath165 gyrs in a galaxy with a flat rotation curve and @xmath166 km s@xmath22 : @xmath167 @xcite estimate @xmath168 for the combined large and small magellanic clouds .",

    "although dynamical friction seems like the most favourable explanation for the orbit evolution it does require sgr to be an order of magnitude more massive just 2 gyrs ago and debris lost at that time in our mass - follows - light models would have a correspondingly larger dispersion in velocity ( by a factor of order @xmath172 ) and distances .",
    "since the observed velocity dispersion in the debris in the discrepant , leading portion of the stream is actually quite similar to that seen in our simulations ( @xmath173 km s@xmath22 , see fig .",
    "[ simplot1 ] ) this suggests that , in order to fit the data , in addition to dropping our assumption of a single orbit for sgr , we will also have to move beyond modelling sgr as a _",
    "single component _ system . hence , while the mean trend in the leading streamer will tell us how much total mass needs to have been lost from sgr , the low dispersion offers the additional opportunity of constraining how much more tightly bound the light matter is compared to the dark matter .",
    "a study of these combined effects is in progress .",
    "in this paper we have presented the first model of the tidal tails of the sgr dwarf galaxy based upon a coherent , all - sky picture of the system in both position and radial velocity , as represented by m giants selected from the 2mass database .",
    "we summarize our conclusions as follows :    shape and evolution of the galactic potential  in a companion paper ( paper iii ) we have shown that _ oblate _ ( @xmath1 0.90 ) models of the galactic halo potential best reproduce the difference in orbital poles between leading and trailing m giant tidal debris , while in this paper ( see also @xcite ) we find that _ prolate _ ( @xmath1 1.25 ) models are required to reproduce the trend of observed m giant leading debris velocities .",
    "although we explore a wide variety of galactic potentials we fail to find a single orbit that can simultaneously reproduce the observed orbital pole precession and leading debris velocity trend , and conclude that some evolution of the orbit of sgr has occured over the past few gyr .",

    "these values depend on the distance scale adopted for the m giants and the exact form of the galactic potential .    proper motion of sgr  for our best - fit models ( @xmath1 0.90/1.0/1.25 ) , the tidal tails of the dwarf as traced by 2mass m giants are best reproduced by a satellite situated at @xmath175 ( 16.2 , 2.3 , -5.9 ) kpc with velocity tangential to the line - of - sight @xmath121 275 - 280/265 - 270/255 - 260 km s@xmath22 corresponding to space velocities @xmath176 ( 238 , -42 , 222)/(235 , -40 , 213)/(231 , -37 , 198 ) km s@xmath22 , i.e. @xmath136(230 , 75 , 222)/(227 , 73 , 213)/(224 , 69 , 197 ) km s@xmath22 , @xmath137 ( 171 , 272 , -65)/(171 , 263 , -63)/(171 , 247 , -59 ) km s@xmath22 , and proper motion @xmath151 mas yr@xmath22 and @xmath152 mas yr@xmath22 in the solar rest frame .",
    "these velocities are dependent on the model assumed for the galactic potential , and will scale roughly with choice of @xmath94 and other galactic parameters .    solar neighborhood debris  our best - fit models orbiting in oblate ( @xmath177 ) and spherical ( @xmath178 ) potentials predict that the sun is currently bathing in a stream of debris from sgr , passing both inside and outside the solar circle",
    ". however , models orbiting in prolate ( @xmath1 1.25 ) potentials are inconsistent with this prediction , suggesting that conclusive proof of the presence or absence of sgr debris in the solar neighborhood could prove a useful tool for discriminating between models of the galactic potential .",

    "<S> m giants recovered from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) have recently been used to map the position and velocity distributions of tidal debris from the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal galaxy entirely around the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this data set to both test particle orbits and n - body simulations of satellite destruction run within a variety of rigid milky way potentials and find that the mass of the milky way within 50 kpc of its center should be @xmath0 in order for any sgr orbit to simultaneously fit the velocity gradient in the sgr trailing debris and the apocenter of the sgr leading debris . </S>",
    "<S> orbital pole precession of young debris and leading debris velocities in regions corresponding to older debris provide contradictory evidence in favor of oblate / prolate galactic halo potentials respectively , leading us to conclude that the orbit of sgr has evolved over the past few gyr . </S>",
    "<S> in light of this discrepancy , we consider constraints from the younger portions of the debris alone within three models of the flattening of the galactic potential ( @xmath1 0.90/1.0/1.25 , i.e. oblate / spherical / prolate ) in our further n - body simulations . based upon the velocity dispersion and width along the trailing tidal stream </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the current bound mass of sgr to be @xmath2 independant of the form of the galactic potential ; this corresponds to a range of mass to light ratios @xmath3 - 36 @xmath4 for the sgr core . </S>",
    "<S> models with masses in this range best fit the apocenter of leading sgr tidal debris when they orbit with a radial period of roughly 0.85 gyr and have perigalactica and apogalactica of about 15 kpc and 60 kpc respectively </S>",
    "<S> . these distances will scale with the assumed distance to the sgr dwarf and the assumed depth of the galactic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the density distribution of debris along the orbit in these models is consistent with the m giant observations , and debris at all orbital phases where m giants are obviously present is younger ( i.e. was lost more recently from the satellite ) than the typical age of a sgr m giant star . </S>"
