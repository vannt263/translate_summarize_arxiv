    "a flat rotating stellar disc and a slowly rotating spheroidal bulge in spiral and lenticular galaxies usually possess very different stellar population properties . consequently",
    ", the resulting stellar line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) can be strongly asymmetric in regions where the light contributions of both disc and bulge are comparable . at the first approximation , this can be accounted by the gauss - hermite parametrization of the losvd ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van der marel & franx , 1993 ) ) , however , different absorption features ( e.g. sensitive to age and metallicity ) will have different effective losvds .",
    "the first attempt to recover parametrically the multi - component dynamics connected to multi - component stellar populations was done by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* de bryuine et al . 2004 ) where the authors used stellar spectra to model different stellar populations . here",
    "we present a more realistic approach based on the full spectral fitting , where multiple dynamical components are represented by multiple simple stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "more sophisticated stellar population models can be used instead of ssps .",
    "as an example , here we present a two - component model having two pure gaussian losvd components with different stellar populations characterised by their ages and metallicities .",
    "an optimal template is represented by the linear combination of two ssps each convolved with its own losvd , hence the @xmath0 value is computed as follows :    @xmath1 ^ 2}{\\delta f_i^2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 - pure gaussian losvd ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are observed flux and its uncertainty ; @xmath5 is the flux from the @xmath6-th synthetic spectrum of ssp with given age @xmath7 and metallicity @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is multiplicative legendre polynomials of order @xmath10 for correcting the continuum which determined at each step of minimization loop by solving the linear least - square problem ; @xmath11 is the j - th component weight ( normally found by the linear minimization ) . the important point in this study",
    "is that we fixed the relative ssp contributions @xmath11 to the values derived from the photometric light profile decomposition .",
    "this approach was implemented on top of the nbursts full spectral fitting technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "our new approach was applied to the real spectra of luminous early - type galaxy ngc  524 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* katkov et al . ( 2011 ) ) ) .",
    "it was shown that losvd of ngc  524 exhibits strong asymmetry and a stellar component of galaxy can be described as a bulge , inner disc and a conterrotating outer disc .",
    "in order to explore the parameter space , we constructed and analysed using our technique a sample of 8000 realizations of synthetical spectra created as a linear combination of two components ( see table  [ tabl_parameters ] ) adding the random noise corresponding to the signal - noise ratio ( snr ) 100 .",
    "the relative contributions @xmath12 were fixed .",
    "the degeneracies between all the parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mc ] as a covariance matrix . here and after red and blue points correspond to the bulge and disc components respectively .",
    "we can see that the most degenerated pairs of parameters are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .           in order to demonstrate how the parameters are recovered depending on the snr we fitted a sample of 8000 models varying a snr between 30 and 250 .",
    "[ fig_snr](top line ) shows how the output parameter uncertainty decreases when increasing snr .",
    "the dashed lines show the input parameters of synthetic spectrum .",
    "we used the same approach to demonstrate how important is the knowledge of relative contributions @xmath11 .",
    "[ fig_snr](bottom line ) presents 4000 mc realizations where we varied the relative ssp contribution of bulge component @xmath15 in range between 0.5 and 0.9 while the real value was equal to 0.7 .",
    "snr=150 was adopted in these realisations .",
    "it is obvious that even little offset in @xmath11 can lead to important biases in the recovered parameters ."
