    "n quantum mechanics , the mathematical description of a composite quantum system is based on both the superposition principle and the tensorial structure of the hilbert space associated with it .",
    "the coexistence of these two principles makes the properties of generic states of a composite quantum system particularly weird , in the sense that they can not be reproduced by any state of a classical system .",
    "some of the most striking non - classical properties exhibited by quantum states can be collected under the name of _ quantum correlations _",
    "@xcite . nowadays , there is universal consensus on the fact that the quantum correlations shared by two subsystems in a global pure state are entirely captured by entanglement and can be quantified by any valid entanglement measure @xcite . on the other hand , it is also now quite clear that there exist non - entangled mixed states still manifesting some non - classical features , such as an unavoidable disturbance due to local measurements , which embodies the concept of quantum discord @xcite",
    ". therefore , in realistic open quantum systems , entanglement may represent only a portion , sometimes negligible , of the quantumness of correlations , while more general figures of merit to quantify quantum correlations are provided by suitable measures of discord - type correlations @xcite . despite an intense recent activity in investigating interpretation , quantification , and applications of discord and related quantifiers of quantum correlations @xcite",
    ", these quantities still remain less understood than entanglement .    in order to unveil the most profound signatures of quantumness in composite systems ,",
    "it is essential to identify mathematically rigorous and physically meaningful properties that differentiate the notion of discord - type quantum correlations from that of entanglement ( and of classical correlations ) , and are manifested by any valid measure thereof .",
    "one such property common to generic discord - type correlation measures is , for instance , the absence of monogamy @xcite . besides the fundamental implications , this area of investigation has a technological motivation @xcite , since quantum correlations beyond and even without entanglement have been shown to play a resource role for certain schemes of quantum computation @xcite , communication @xcite , and metrology @xcite .",
    "finding valuable and general traits of these quantum correlation resources , in particular for what concerns their dynamical preservation during the unavoidable interaction of a principal quantum systems with the surrounding environments , constitutes an important aim with a clear potential to lead to useful recipes for their practical exploitation .",
    "numerous works have in fact investigated the dynamics of general quantum correlations in open quantum systems undergoing various types of markovian or non - markovian evolution , as reviewed e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "although different measures of quantum correlations can exhibit distinct features and impose inequivalent orderings on the set of quantum states , it has emerged as a general trait that discord - type quantum correlations are more robust than entanglement against noise @xcite ( see also @xcite for a critical assessment ) and can not generally vanish at a finite evolution time ( due to the fact that zero - discord states are of null measure @xcite ) , while entanglement can suffer so - called sudden death @xcite . however , a fascinating and nontrivial phenomenon of _ extreme _ robustness to noise exhibited by general quantum correlations deserves special attention , and is the subject of our investigation .",
    "namely , under local non - dissipative decoherence evolutions , it has been observed that a number of known discord - type measures all remain constant ( ` frozen ' ) for a finite time interval in markovian conditions @xcite , and for multiple intervals @xcite or forever @xcite in non - markovian conditions , when considering two non - interacting qubits initially in a specific class of bell - diagonal states .",
    "this freezing phenomenon , not exhibited by any measure of entanglement , is quite appealing since it implies that every protocol relying on discord - type quantum correlations as a resource will run with a performance unaffected by noise in the specific dynamical conditions .",
    "currently , the occurrence of freezing has been investigated by explicitly considering the evaluation of specific discord - type measures on a case by case basis @xcite .",
    "however , it is natural to ask whether this phenomenon is a mere mathematical accident due to the particular choices of quantum correlations quantifiers , or whether it must manifest independently of the adopted measure , thus having a universal character and promising to bear a deep physical meaning .",
    "this work addresses such an issue .",
    "we prove that freezing occurs for any geometric measure of quantum correlations , whenever the distance defining the measure respects a minimal set of physical assumptions , namely dynamical contractivity under quantum channels , invariance under transposition , and convexity .",
    "the freezing phenomenon is therefore revealed as _ universal _ within the geometric approach to quantum correlations .",
    "notice that our work differs from other complementary investigations of the freezing phenomenon @xcite .",
    "in particular , in a recent work @xcite , the authors provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a general state to exhibit freezing under non - dissipative decoherence , according to some specific measure of discord . here ,",
    "instead , we focus on a specific class of initial states , and we identify the minimal set of conditions that _ any _ general distance - based measure of discord needs to satisfy in order to freeze . on some random family of initial states , it is certainly possible to see freezing according to one discord - type measure but not to another .",
    "what we prove here is that , for the specific class of bell - diagonal states identified in @xcite , all _ bona fide _ geometric quantifiers of quantum correlations ( respecting the three physical assumptions mentioned above ) undergo the same dynamics , featuring the freezing phenomenon . in proving the main result , we also introduce and characterise a global quantum control channel which can completely invert decoherence on a subset of bell - diagonal two - qubit states , and can be of independent interest .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first summarise the properties any valid measure of quantum correlations is expected to hold , and provide general definitions for distance - based measures , distinguishing between those for entanglement and those for discord - type correlations . in the * results * section , we illustrate the freezing phenomenon in geometric terms , by considering for convenience the specific case of the bures distance - based measure of quantum correlations .",
    "we then present the main result , by proving that freezing must happen for any bona fide distance - based discord - type measure .",
    "finally , we offer our conclusions in the * discussion * section .",
    "some technical bits are deferred to the * methods * section .",
    "* measures of quantum correlations*. here we recall the requirements that a valid measure of quantum correlations is expected to have , later focusing specifically on geometric ( distance - based ) definitions . for more details on the quantification of quantum correlations ,",
    "the reader is referred to recent review articles @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a state @xmath0 of a two - qubit system , with subsystems tagged @xmath1 and @xmath2 . as is well known @xcite ,",
    "entanglement quantifiers capture the degree of non - separability of the state @xmath3 of the global system ; the corresponding distance - based measures of entanglement are calculated from the set @xmath4 of separable states @xcite , i.e. , states @xmath5 which can be written as convex combination of product states , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a probability distribution , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are arbitrary ensembles of states for subsystem @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",

    "( [ eq : contractivity ] ) is a fundamental requirement for a distance in quantum information theory @xcite , and has two purposes .",
    "first , it makes @xmath46 a statistically relevant distance , due to the fact that non - invertible cptp maps are the mathematical counterparts of noise and the latter can not lead to any increase in the information related to the distinguishability of quantum states @xcite .",
    "second , ( d.i ) makes the distance - based measures of entanglement @xmath47 and quantum correlations @xmath48 [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : geometricentanglement ] ) and ( [ eq : geometricquantumcorrelations ] ) ] physically meaningful , by implying the essential properties ( e.ii ) , ( e.iii ) , ( q.ii ) , ( q.iii ) , and also ( q.iii.bis ) , where the latter applies to the corresponding distance - based one - way discord - type measure @xmath55 defined by choosing the set of cq ( rather than cc ) states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : geometricquantumcorrelations ] ) .",
    "notice that ( d.i ) implies in particular the standard property of invariance of the distance @xmath46 under unitary operations , since they can be seen as reversible cptp maps ; namely , @xmath56 , for any pair of states @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and any unitary @xmath57 .    on the other hand , the invariance of a distance @xmath46 under transposition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : antiunitarity ] ) , is not typically discussed in the literature .",
    "however , transposition of an @xmath58 hermitian matrix , which amounts to complex conjugation in the computational basis , corresponds to a reflection in a @xmath59$]-dimensional hyperplane .",
    "property ( d.ii ) thus means that a distance @xmath46 on the set of quantum states is assumed to be invariant under reflections , which appears as a fairly natural requirement @xcite .",

    "any antiunitary matrix @xmath60 can be expressed as @xmath61 , where @xmath57 is a unitary matrix and @xmath62 denotes complex conjugation in the computational basis .",

    "( [ eq : convexity ] ) , is also quite intuitive and it makes the corresponding distance - based entanglement measure @xmath47 convex , implying the desirable property ( e.iv ) .",
    "notice however that discord - type measures are , by contrast , neither convex nor concave @xcite , as the set @xmath15 of classical states is not a convex set @xcite .",
    "there are a number of known distances which satisfy the three physical assumptions listed above @xcite , and have been employed to define valid geometric measures of quantum correlations .",
    "suitable examples for @xmath46 include in particular the the relative entropy @xcite , the squared bures distance @xcite , the squared hellinger distance @xcite , and the trace ( or schatten one - norm ) distance @xcite .",
    "contrarily , the hilbert - schmidt distance does not respect the contractivity property ( d.i ) , and earlier attempts to adopt it to define geometric measures of quantum correlations @xcite have led to inconsistencies @xcite .    in this paper , we label a generic distance @xmath46 obeying properties ( d.i ) , ( d.ii ) , and ( d.iii ) as a bona fide one , and the associated distance - based quantities @xmath47 and @xmath48 as bona fide measures of entanglement and discord - type correlations respectively .",

    "we also note that the action of this channel resembles ( but is different from ) the physical situation of refocusing by dynamical decoupling control on qubits undergoing low - frequency pure dephasing @xcite . the further characterisation and experimental implementation of our global rephasing map for quantum information processing calls for an independent analysis which is beyond the scope of this paper .    from a fundamental perspective it is important to understand the deeper physical origin of frozen quantum correlations .",
    "there are reasons to reckon that the phenomenon is related to the complementary freezing of _ classical _ correlations .",
    "typically , as observed so far using specific quantifiers , given particular dynamical and initial conditions as studied here , quantum correlations are initially frozen and classical correlations decay but , after a characteristic time @xmath103 , classical correlations freeze and quantum correlations decay @xcite .",
    "this has been linked to the finite - time emergence of the classical pointer basis within the fundamental theory of decoherence @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , classical correlations are still inconsistently defined in geometric approaches @xcite and it remains unknown whether they exhibit freezing after @xmath237 for any bona fide distance .",

    "@xcite in a reference basis , can also remain frozen under local nondissipative decoherence channels for the same class of initial states as studied here @xcite .",
    "such a result holds more generally for a class of @xmath238-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals ( for any even @xmath238 ) , which include and extend the two - qubit set discussed in this work .",
    "this suggests that multiqubit and multipartite quantum correlations can freeze as well under the same dynamical conditions @xcite , and the methods of this work can be readily employed to prove the universality of freezing within the geometric approach , in such a more general instance as well .",
    "our result has also an impact from an applicative point of view .",
    "the property of being unaffected by the noise for a given period of time makes quantum correlations other than entanglement important for emergent quantum technologies @xcite . despite numerous basic experimental investigations ,",
    "this resilience has yet to be properly exploited as a resource for quantum enhanced protocols e.g.  in communication , computation , sensing and metrology .",
