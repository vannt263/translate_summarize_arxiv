    "relativistic jets have been observed in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( e.g. urry & pavovani 1995 ; ferrari 1998 ; blandford 2002 ) , in microquasars in our galaxy ( e.g. mirabel & rodriguez 1999 ) , and it is believed that they originate in the regions near accreting ( stellar ) black holes and neutron stars @xcite . to investigate the dynamics of accretion disks and the associated jet formation , we have performed jet formation simulations using a full 3-d grmhd code .",
    "this magnetic - acceleration mechanism has been proposed not only for agn jets , but also for ( nonrelativistic ) protostellar jets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "kudoh , matsumoto , & shibata ( 1998 ) found that the terminal velocity of a jet is comparable to the rotational velocity of the disk at the foot of the jet in nonrelativistic mhd simulations , and that a relativistic jet should be formed near the event horizon .",
    "it should be noted that the mechanism of jet generation in neutron star binaries may be different from black hole binaries .",
    "recently , an ultra - relativistic outflow was observed from an accreting stellar - mass neutron star ( fender et al .",
    "fender et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have concluded that the generation of highly relativistic outflows does not require properties unique to black holes , such as an event horizon .",
    "it seems plausible that production of ultrarelativistic jets may be a generic feature of accretion onto neutron stars such as cir - x and sco x-1 at or near to the eddington limit .",
    "this result differs from the suggestions that the velocities of jets would be limited to the surface escape speed ( livio 1999 ) .",
    "the fluorescent iron line ( k@xmath4 ) seen in the x - ray spectrum of many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and particularly in seyfert galaxies , has provided us with an extremely useful probe of the region close to an accreting black hole .",
    "this is an important diagnostic with which to study doppler and gravitational redshifts , thereby providing key information on the local kinematics of the material ( see the reviews by fabian et al . 2000 and reynolds & nowak 2003 ) .",
    "the simultaneous x - ray / ir flares from a black hole / relativistic jet system are the observational evidence revealing a time - dependent interaction between the jet and inner disk ( e.g. ueda et al . 2002 ) . in regions where disk - jet interactions take place near a black hole ,",
    "the plasma and magnetic fields interact in a complicated manner ; therefore a 3-dimensional grmhd simulation such as we perform here is required to investigate dynamics near the horizon and ultimately to couple predicted dynamics to the iron line .",
    "@xcite have investigated in 2-d , the dynamics of an accretion disk initially threaded by a uniform magnetic field in a non - rotating corona ( either in a state of steady fall or in hydrostatic equilibrium ) around a non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) black hole .",
    "the numerical results show that matter in the disk loses angular momentum by magnetic braking , then falls into the black hole .",
    "the disk falls faster in this simulation than in the non - relativistic case because of general - relativistic effects that are important below @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "a centrifugal barrier at @xmath6 strongly decelerates the infalling material .",
    "plasma near the shock at the centrifugal barrier is accelerated by the @xmath7 force and forms bipolar jets . inside this _ magnetically driven jet _ , the gradient of gas pressure also generates a jet above the shock region ( _ gas - pressure driven jet _ ) .",
    "this _ two - layered jet structure _ is formed both in a hydrostatic corona and in a steady - state falling corona .",
    "koide et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have also developed a new grmhd code using a kerr geometry and have found that , with a rapidly rotating ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are angular momentum and mass of black hole ) black - hole magnetosphere .",
    "the maximum velocity of the jet is ( 0.3 - 0.4 ) @xmath12 .",
    "recently the extraction of rotational energy from plasma in the ergosphere has been investigated ( koide et al .",
    "2002 ; koide 2003 ) .",
    "all of these grmhd simulations were made assuming axisymmetry with respect to the @xmath13-axis and mirror symmetry with respect to the plane @xmath14 .",
    "it is known that the axisymmetric assumption suppresses azimuthal instabilities .",
    "magnetic fields are expected to play an essential role in the dynamics of most relativistic objects such as active galactic nuclei , x - ray binaries , gamma - ray bursts , and quasars . in accretion disks ,",
    "the most important role of the magnetic field is angular momentum transport , which twists the field , and results in torsional alfvn waves ( taws ) and associated jet formation ( koide et al .",
    "1999 ) . based on the importance of magnetorotational instability ( mri ) in accretion disks @xcite ,",
    "the nonlinear growth of these instabilities has been investigated by three - dimensional global mhd simulations of black hole accretion disks @xcite using a pseudo - newtonian potential @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated black hole accretion flow using three - dimensional global resistive mhd simulations .",
    "they conclude that the reconnection in the innermost region releases enough energy to explain the origin of x - ray bursts from black hole candidates .",
    "recently , more grmhd simulations have been developed by @xcite . in particular , @xcite have employed the numerical scheme harm ( high accuracy relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ) in which the conservation schemes for grmhd are used @xcite .",
    "a nonconservative scheme for grmhd following a zeus - like approach has been developed also by @xcite .",
    "they also compare the code performance of 1-d and 2-d test cases .",
    "@xcite have investigated the properties of accretion flows with tori in the kerr metric using 3-d grmhd simulations .",

    "different studies have chosen various initial magnetic fields .",
    "we have chosen an initial magnetic field from the wald s exact analytic solution for a kerr black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field ( wald 1974 ; punsley 2001 ; komissarov 2004 ) .",
    "de villiers , hawley & krolik ( 2003 ) have performed simulations in which the initial conditions for the accretion disks and magnetic fields are appropriate for mri research .",
    "they have investigated the properties of accretion flows in the kerr metric including bi - conical outflows in the quarter sphere with periodic boundary conditions in the azimuthal direction .",
    "these simulations use the torus accretion disks as an initial condition .",
    "the inner edge of the accretion disk is located at @xmath15 , and the inner edge moves into the innermost stable radius within one orbit ( de villiers , hawley , & krolik 2003 ) . in these simulations ,",
    "the initial field consists of axisymmetric ( azimuthal ) field loops , laid down along an isodensity surface within the torus , which is different from the initial uniform magnetic field used in simulations by koide , shibata , & kudoh ( 1999 ) and nishikawa et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "the initial weak loop magnetic fields contribute to the generation of the mri and the associated jet .",
    "however , the structure of magnetic fields piled up near the black hole in their simulations is different from the magnetic fields which are twisted and pinched ( not wound ) by the free - falling corona and accretion disk ( koide , shibata , & kudoh 1998 , 1999 ;",
    "koide et al .",

    "in this paper we present a fully three - dimensional , grmhd simulation of jet formation with a thin accretion disk .",
    "our motivation for this type of simulation is to determine the parameters necessary for relativistic jet formation and the resulting interaction and instabilities found between the accretion disk and the black hole .",
    "the simulation we present here was performed using the same parameters as in @xcite in order to determine the physical differences resulting from a full 3-d versus a 2-d simulation with axisymmetry and mirror symmetry at the equator .",
    "the three - dimensional simulation allows us to study the evolution of jet formation because it is run for longer light - crossing times than the previous two - dimensional simulations .",

    "figure 7b shows the contribution to jet generation due to the electromagnetic field ( @xmath161 ) ( outer part ) and gas pressure ( latexmath:[$5 <    of the jet @xmath150 ( red ) in fig .",
    "7c . however , the region of acceleration due to gas pressure is smaller than in the axisymmetric case",
    ". this may come from the fact that the time here is somewhat later than the @xmath163 in the axisymmetric case and/or due to 3-d effects .",
    "the three - velocity components are plotted in fig .",
    "it should be noted that the jet has a larger azimuthal component ( @xmath149 ) near the disk than the @xmath13 component ( @xmath150 ) which becomes larger far from the disk .",
    "a slightly positive radial velocity @xmath148 ( blue ) is found far from the disk in fig .",
    "7c , and this indicates outward angular momentum transfer .",
    "the alfvn velocity @xmath164 and the sound velocity @xmath165 are shown along with the absolute value of @xmath150 in fig .",
    "the velocity @xmath150 gradually increases in the magnetically driven region @xmath166 but does not exceed either the sound or alfvn velocities .",
    "figure 8 shows one dimensional slices of the velocities @xmath148 ( blue ) , @xmath149 ( green ) , and @xmath150 ( red ) , at @xmath167 ( @xmath119 ) for times ( a ) @xmath168 , ( b ) @xmath169 , ( c ) @xmath170 , and ( d ) @xmath171 .",
    "the jet is seen in @xmath150 ( red curve ) and its maximum velocity can be found in fig . 8c . comparison between the velocity structure at @xmath172 @xmath173 ( fig .",
    "8c ) and @xmath174 ( not shown ) reveals that the jet velocity ( @xmath150 ) and the azimuthal velocity ( @xmath149 ) are smaller at @xmath175 .",
    "additionally , the location of peak velocities ( @xmath150 ) are shifted outward at the later time .",
    "this may come from the fact that the wind is caused by the unwinding magnetic fields with the taws which are propagating outward in the disk .",
    "these results are consistent with the fact that the jet has faded and a weak wind is generated around @xmath176 as seen in fig .",
    "furthermore , the rotation of the accretion disk ( @xmath149 ) becomes very small and rotates slightly in the reverse direction around @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "we plan to investigate how these changes are affected by inflow of matter to the system in the future .",
    "a comparison of our present results with previous two - dimensional results shown in @xcite reveals some minor differences that may be due to the three - dimensional modeling .",
    "the most prominent difference between this 3-d simulation and previous 2-d simulations lies in the longer run time and hence shows a significant change in the disk - jet system to a disk - wind system ( fender 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "this transition may be caused by outward taw propagation in the disk .",
    "the jet is mainly produced by the gradient of gas pressure enhanced by the shock around @xmath179 , as shown in figs .",
    "1c , 3c and 6b .",
    "after @xmath180 , the taw moves outward in the disk and is weakened .",
    "the wind appears while the taw is moving outward .",
    "after outward propagation of the taw , the pressure of the outer disk becomes larger than the initial condition ( fig .",
    "therefore , the wind may be caused by unwinding of the twisted and pinched magnetic fields due to the decreased accreting matter , which creates the taw propagating outward in the disk .",
    "this transient change may be controlled by the mass accretion rate onto the black hole .",
    "it should be noted that in the simulations with initial weak azimuthal magnetic fields the magnetic fields are tangled as shown in fig . 6 in hirose",
    "et al .  ( 2004 ) as a result of mri where taws are not excited .",
    "we have presented a fully 3-d grmhd simulation of a schwarzschild black hole accretion disk system with moderate resolution .",
    "because no deliberate asymmetric perturbation was introduced , the present 3d simulation remains largely axisymmetric . while we found some numerical differences between this simulation and previous two - dimensional simulations ,",
    "our results reaffirm the previous result of a two - layered jet .",
    "our results suggest that the jet develops as in the 2-d case .",
    "our longer simulation has allowed us to study jet evolution . at the end of this simulation",
    "the jet fades and a weak wind is generated by a thickened accretion disk .",
    "this phenomena was not observed in the two - dimensional simulations because they did not run for this duration .    in this simulation at the outer boundary of the accretion disk no matter is injected , therefore after accreted matter is ejected from the accretion as a jet , the power to generate a jet is dissipated and the jet is switched to a wind . however ,",
    "if streaming matter is injected at the outer boundary of accretion disk , transient changes may be controlled by accretion rates with instabilities and be related to the state transitions .",
    "such disk - jet coupling in black hole binaries is reviewed by fender ( 2002 , 2003 ) and fender , belloni , & gallo ( 2004 ) .",
    "black hole binaries exhibit several different kinds of x - ray ` state ' .",
    "the two most diametrically opposed , which illustrate the relation of jet formation to accretion , can be classified as low / hard / off and high / soft states ( fender 2003 ) .",
    "these two states provide different luminosity .",
    "pellegrini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have discussed a nuclear bolometric luminosity and an accretion luminosity @xmath181 in terms of the accretion rate @xmath182 and jet power . clearly these issues can be investigated by further 3-d grmhd simulations , and future simulations will investigate jet formation with different states of the black hole including streaming material from an accompanying star ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "additionally , we plan to study the development of instabilities along the azimuthal direction such as the proposed accretion - ejection instability ( aei ) ( e.g. tagger & pellat 1999 ; caunt & tagger 2001 ; rodriguez et al .",
    "2002 ; vanire , rodriguez & tagger 2002 ) , the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ( e.g. balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ) , and the `` screw '' ( current - driven helical kink ) instability ( e.g. li 2000 ) .",
    "such simulation studies may indicate how the observed variabilities in agn jets ( blandford 2003 ; mirabel 2003 ) and microquasars ( e.g. eikenberry et al .",
    "1998 ; ueda et al . 2002 ; nobil 2003 ; rau , greiner , & mccollough 2003 ) can be produced .",
    "initial magnetic field configurations affect the dynamics of accretion disks and the associated phenomena such as jet formation and its variabilities , and thus we plan to study different initial field configurations .    the fe k@xmath65 fluorescent emission line in active galactic nuclei ( agn )",
    "is believed to originate in a relativistic accretion disk around a black hole ( e.g. see reviews fabian et al .",
    "2000 ; reynolds & nowak 2003 ) . the x - ray continuum emission of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is highly variable ( e.g. vaughan & fabian 2003 ) . the source spectrum and variablity can be explained by two - components consisting of a variable power law component ( plc ) and an almost constant reflection - dominated component ( rdc ) containing the iron line ( fabian & vaughan 2003 ) .",
    "the region where the flare ( or multiple flares ) which created the plc must be located close to the rotation axis and within 3 - 4 gravitational radii to reproduce the highly variable behavior , ( miniutti et al .",
    "since this behavior is most likely powered by magnetic field from the disk , possibly linking to the hole ( e.g. blandford & znajek 1977 ; wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) , and perhaps forming the base of jet , it is essential to perform grmhd simulations .",
    "these issues are being investigated with 3-d grmhd simulations with a kerr black hole with streaming matter from an accompanying star .",
