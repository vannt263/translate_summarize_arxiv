    "magnetic fields play an important role in the dynamics of many relativistic astrophysical systems such as pulsars , magnetars , gamma - ray burst ( grbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . in many of these scenarios , the ohmic diffusion timescales of the magnetized plasma",
    "is much longer than the characteristic dynamical timescale of the system , so one can formally take the limit of infinite electrical conductivity .",
    "this is regarded as the ideal mhd limit , and it is in general a good approximation to describe astrophysical plasmas .",
    "furthermore , such a limit is described by a relatively manageable , but certainly involved hyperbolic system of equations without stiff terms which facilitates its computational implementation .",
    "the ideal mhd limit has been extensively used in the last years to study many of the previous systems ( i.e. , which basically consist of magnetized neutron stars and black hole accretion disks ) in the fully non - linear regime .    in spite of its success and convenience , the ideal mhd approximation also has some limitations . at a purely theoretical level",
    ", the assumption of vanishing electrical resistivity prevents some important physical phenomena such as dissipation and reconnection of the magnetic field lines .",
    "reconnection efficiently converts magnetic energy into heat and kinetical energy in very short timescales .",
    "this process is believed to be the mechanism originating many energetic emissions , such as in soft gamma - ray repeaters ( which could be explained by giant magnetar flares ) , the y - point of pulsar magnestosphere or even the short gamma - ray bursts  @xcite . in order to describe such processes , schemes going beyond the ideal mhd limit",
    "are required .",
    "at the numerical level , all numerical schemes inherit some numerical resistivity which depends strongly on the resolution , making difficult to disentangle physical phenomena from numerical artifacts especially in highly demanding computational scenarios .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields demands relatively high resolution to accurately capture all the physical processes involved , many of them occurring at very small scales .",
    "this high resolution is particularly important in the case of instabilities which amplify the magnetic field , such as the kelvin - helmholtz instability occurring during the merger of binary neutron stars  , and the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) occurring in accretion disks  @xcite .",
    "accurate modeling of the rarefied magnetospheres of compact objects similarly requires high resolution .",
    "the electromagnetic fields in this region may be easier to model by adopting a different limit of the mhd equations known as the _ force - free limit _  @xcite . in this approximation the fluid inertia is neglected , implying that the fluid does not influence directly the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "one possibility to overcome these limitations is to consider instead the resistive mhd framework and solve the full maxwell and hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the coupling between these two is provided by the current by a suitable ohm s law. with a convenient choice of current , including both induction and ohmic terms , it is possible to recover both the ideal mhd limit , as well as the finite - resistivity scheme required to describe physical dissipation and reconnections . the effect of small - scales - dynamics can also be modeled with moderate resolutions by using a suitable current .",
    "finally , magnetically dominated magnetospheres can be described by a phenomenological current that decouples the fluid from the force - free em fields .",
    "the numerical evolution of this resistive mhd code is not free of difficulties .",
    "the resistive mhd equations can be regarded as an hyperbolic system with relaxation terms that become stiff for some limits of the current .",
    "consequently , numerical evolution of this system represents a numerical challenge , and several works have recently explored different possibilities to implement it  @xcite . in this work",
    "we take a step further in the development of one of these approaches , based on the implicit - explicit ( imex ) runge - kutta .",
    "our aim is to model both the interior and the exterior of a star with a phenomenological current based on physical arguments",
    ". this will be particularly interesting to study the electromagnetic emissions of astrophysical relativistic systems involving magnetized neutron stars .",
    "the capabilities of our approach are tested by considering the force - free aligned rotator solution , a well studied problem in the context of pulsar magnetospheres  .",
    "these works were restricted to flat spacetime and excluded the interior of the star from the computational domain , thus side - stepped the stiffness problem mentioned above . recently a hybrid approach , matching both the ideal and force - free system of equations , revisited this problem within a framework capable of studying both star and surrounding magnetosphere within general relativity  @xcite .",
    "however such a scheme still relies on two different approximations applied in two regions .",
    "the approach we present here finally allows for treating the system from a global point of view with a single , general relativistic , framework .",
    "we also revisit another important astrophysical scenario with a much less understood dynamics ; the collapse of a magnetized neutron star to a black hole .",
    "this system represents even a more challenging problem because of the strong gravity fields , and it has been studied numerically by considering different approximations .",
    "an early study matched an analytical solution for the star to an electrovacuum magnetosphere  @xcite .",
    "more recently , further realism was achieved by adopting the hybrid scheme that matched the numerical solution of the star to force - free magnetosphere  @xcite . a step towards studying this system within a common , resistive ,",
    "framework was presented in  @xcite , although the star s exterior was treated as an electrovacuum magnetosphere .",
    "our approach presented here is able to consistently study the star and its force - free magnetosphere within the general relativistic resistive mhd equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : equations ] summarizes the fully relativistic resistive mhd system , which is slightly different from the one adopted in  @xcite . in section  [ sec : coupling_em_fluid ] it is discussed a generic family of algebraic ohm s law , and how to construct a phenomenological current to recover both the ideal mhd and the force - free limits .",
    "section  [ sec : hyperbolic_relaxation ] summarizes briefly the imex runge - kutta methods and different techniques to solve generically the implicit step for any algebraic form of the relaxation terms .",
    "the application of these methods to the resistive mhd system is performed is section  [ sec : rmhd ] .",
    "section  [ sec : simulations ] presents our numerical results for the aligned rotator and the collapse of a neutron star to a black hole .",
    "we conclude with some remarks .    throughout this work",
    "we adopt geometric units such that @xmath0 , and the convention where greek indices @xmath1 denote spacetime components ( ie , from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) , while roman indices @xmath4 denote spatial ones .",
    "bold letters will represent vectors .",
    "this section summarizes the general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations , that will allow us to model self - gravitating magnetized fluids .",
    "the evolution of the spacetime geometry is governed by einstein equations .",
    "the electromagnetic fields and the fluid obey , respectively , the maxwell and the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the closure of the system is given by two constitutive equations ; the first one is the equation of state , which relates the pressure to the other fluid variables .",
    "the second one is ohm s law , defining the coupling between the fluid and the electromagnetic fields which will be described in the next section .",
    "the geometry of the spacetime can be obtained by solving the four - dimensional einstein equations .",
    "these equations can be recast as a standard initial value problem by splitting explicitly the time and the space coordinates through a 3 + 1 decomposition , such that the line element can be expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spacetime metric , @xmath7 is the intrinsic metric of the spacelike hypersurfaces , and the lapse function @xmath8 and the shift vector @xmath9 relates how the coordinates change between neighboring hypersurfaces .",
    "the normal to the hypersurfaces is given explicitly by @xmath10 indices on spacetime quantities are raised and lowered with the 4-metric and its inverse , while the 3-metric and its inverse are used to raise and lower indices on spatial quantities .",
    "the rate of change of the intrinsic curvature from one hypersurface to another is given by the extrinsic curvature @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lie derivative along the vector @xmath9 .",
    "at any given time , the spacetime geometry is then fully defined by the @xmath13 variables @xmath14 .",
    "we adopt the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) formulation of einstein s equations to evolve a suitable combination of these fields , in a form very close to the presented in  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic fields follow maxwell equations , that in their extended version can be written as  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the maxwell and the faraday tensors , @xmath17 is the electric current and @xmath18 are scalars introduced to control dynamically the constraints by exponentially damping them in a characteristic time @xmath19",
    "when both the electric and magnetic susceptibility of the medium vanish , like in vacuum or in a highly ionized plasma , the faraday tensor is simply the dual of the maxwell one , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the levi - civita pseudotensor of the spacetime , related to the 4-indices levi - civita symbol @xmath22 by @xmath23 in this case , both tensors can be decomposed in terms of the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath24 such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the electric and magnetic fields measured by a normal observer @xmath27 .",
    "both fields are purely spatial , that is , @xmath28 .",
    "the covariant maxwell equations ( [ maxwell_ext_eqs2a ] , [ maxwell_ext_eqs2b ] ) can be written , by performing the 3 + 1 decomposition , in term of the electromagnetic fields and the divergence - cleaning scalars  @xcite as , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the three - dimensional levi - civita pseudotensor .",
    "since @xmath31 is antisymmetric , the four - divergence of equation ( [ maxwell_ext_eqs2a ] ) leads to an additional equation for the current conservation of maxwell solutions , @xmath32 the electric current @xmath17 can be decomposed into components along and perpendicular to the vector @xmath33 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the charge density and the current as observed by a normal observer @xmath33 .",
    "again , @xmath36 is purely spatial , so @xmath37",
    ". the current conservation ( [ conserved_current ] ) can be expressed , with the 3 + 1 decomposition , as @xmath38 only a prescription for the spatial components @xmath39 , which will determine the coupling between the em fields and the fluid , is required to complete the system of maxwell equations .",
    "this relation , commonly known as ohm s law , will be discussed in detail in section  [ sec : coupling_em_fluid ] .      a perfect fluid minimally coupled to an electromagnetic field is described by the total stress - energy tensor @xmath40                      u_{\\mu } u_{\\nu } + p g_{\\mu \\nu } \\nonumber \\\\     & + & { f_{\\mu}}^{\\lambda } f_{\\nu \\lambda }       - \\frac{1}{4 } g_{\\mu \\nu } ~ f^{\\lambda \\alpha } f_{\\lambda \\alpha } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a factor @xmath41 has been absorbed in the definition of the electromagnetic fields . here",
    "@xmath42 is the rest mass density , @xmath43 the internal energy and @xmath44 is the pressure , given by a closure relation @xmath45 commonly known as the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "these fluid quantities are measured in the rest frame of the fluid element .",
    "however , to describe the system is usually more convenient to adopt an eulerian perspective where coordinates are not tied to the flow of the fluid .",
    "the four - velocity @xmath46 describes how the fluid moves with respect to the eulerian observers , and can be decomposed into space and time components , @xmath47 where @xmath48 corresponds to the familiar three - dimensional velocities as measured by eulerian observers ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) .",
    "the time component is defined by the normalization relation @xmath50 , such that @xmath51 where we can now recognize @xmath52 as the lorentz factor .",
    "in summary , the magnetized fluid is described by the physical fields ( i.e. , the fluid variables and the electromagnetic fields ) plus the divergence cleaning scalars , which form the set of primitive variables @xmath53 the matter evolution must comply with the conservation of the total stress - energy tensor @xmath54 which can be expressed as a system of conservation laws for the energy density @xmath55 and the momentum density @xmath56 , defined from the projections of the stress - energy tensor @xmath57 in addition to the conservation of energy and momentum , the fluid usually also conserves the total number of particles , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the baryon number density .",
    "this equation is just the relativistic generalization of the conservation of mass .    as mentioned above ,",
    "it is necessary to specify the eos to define the pressure and complete the system of hydrodynamic equations . along this paper",
    "we will consider either the polytropic eos @xmath60 , which is a good approximation to describe cold stars , and the ideal gas eos @xmath61 , which allows for shock heating in the fluid .",
    "the evolution of the electromagnetic fields follows the maxwell equations and the conservation of charge , while the fluid fields are governed by the conservation of the total energy , momentum and baryonic number . in order to capture accurately the weak solutions of these non - linear equations in presence of shocks",
    "it is important to express them as a set of local conservation laws , namely @xmath62   \\\\     & = &     - \\sqrt{\\gamma } b^k ( \\partial_k \\beta^i )      + \\sqrt{\\gamma } \\phi \\left ( \\gamma^{ij } \\partial_j \\alpha     - \\alpha \\gamma^{jk } \\gamma^i_{jk } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{maxwell12 }    \\partial_t   ( \\sqrt{\\gamma } e^i )     & + & \\partial_k [ \\sqrt{\\gamma } \\left ( -\\beta^k e^i      - \\alpha ( \\epsilon^{ikj } b_j - \\gamma^{ik } \\psi ) \\right ) ]   \\\\     & = &     - \\sqrt{\\gamma } e^k ( \\partial_k \\beta^i )      + \\sqrt{\\gamma } \\psi \\left ( \\gamma^{ij } \\partial_j \\alpha     - \\alpha \\gamma^{jk } \\gamma^i_{jk } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\    & & - \\alpha \\sqrt{\\gamma } j^i   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "this form of the relativistic resistive mhd equations is basically the same presented already in  @xcite .",
    "another similar formulation has also been derived recently  @xcite .",
    "notice also that the energy conservation has been expressed in terms of the quantity @xmath65 to recover the newtonian limit of the energy density .",
    "maxwell and hydrodynamic equations are coupled by means of the current @xmath66 , whose explicit form generically depends on the electromagnetic fields and the local fluid properties measured in the comoving frame . consequently , it is convenient to introduce the electric and magnetic fields measured by an observer comoving with the fluid , namely @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "notice that , since @xmath69 , there are only three independent components . the maxwell and faraday tensors can therefore be expressed as @xmath70 and the electric current can be decomposed into components along and transverse to @xmath71 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the charge density measured by the comoving observer .",
    "the relation with the eulerian quantities ( [ current_decomposition ] ) can be obtained from @xmath75 substituting these results into eq .",
    "( [ current_decomposition2 ] ) and using the 3 + 1 decomposition of the four - velocity , one can write the spatial components of the current as @xmath76 since the charge density follows directly from the current conservation  ( [ consj_3 + 1 ] ) , the prescription for the three - dimensional electrical current @xmath77 is the only missing piece to completely determine maxwell equations .",
    "a standard prescription , known as the ohm s law , is to consider that the current is proportional to the lorentz force acting on a charged particle , implying a linear relation between the current and the electric field in the comoving frame .",
    "a richer variety of physical phenomena may be described by including also additional terms proportional to the comoving magnetic field , leading to a generalized covariant ohm s law of the form , @xmath78 being @xmath79 the electrical conductivity of the medium  @xcite and @xmath80 a parameter related to the covariant generalization of the mean - field dynamo  @xcite .",
    "the electrical conductivity can be calculated either in the collision - time approximation  @xcite or in the framework of relativistic charged multifluids  @xcite , leading to the same main results .",
    "the tensorial conductivity can be written as , @xmath81 where the coefficients are given by @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the collision or relaxation time , @xmath84 is the electron density and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the electron s charge and mass . in the framework described in  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath87 is introduced as a proportionality constant in the dissipative force between the two components of the fluid .",
    "it is easy to check that the first term of the conductivity ( [ tensorial_conductivity ] ) leads to the well known isotropic scalar case , while the other two represent the anisotropies due to the presence of a magnetic field , corresponding to the hall effect .    in order to compute the closure relation ( [ current_decomposition3 ] ) it is necessary to write the general relativistic ohm s law in terms of fields measured by an eulerian observer .",

    "the third term in the current ( [ ohm_relativistic_spatial ] ) can be neglected , leading to the well - known isotropic ohm s law .",
    "the high conductivity of the fluid implies that , in order to get a finite current , the electric field measured by the comoving observers must vanish @xmath95 this is the ideal - mhd condition , which states that the electric field is not an independent variable since it can be obtained via a simple algebraic relation from the velocity and the magnetic vector fields .",
    "the anisotropic effects are expected to be important in magnetically dominated fluids ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) . in this limit @xmath97 , and the second term in the current ( [ ohm_relativistic_spatial ] ) can be neglected . in highly conducting fluids a finite current",
    "is recovered only if the electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field , @xmath98 since the initial assumption of magnetically dominated fluid prevents the trivial solution @xmath99 . in the next subsection",
    "it will be shown that this relation is one of the constraints of the force - free approximation .",
    "the magnetospheres of magnetized neutron stars  @xcite and black holes immersed in externally sourced magnetic fields  @xcite are filled with a low - density plasma so rarefied that even moderate magnetic fields stresses can easily dominate over the pressure gradients . in this regime , the main contribution to the stress - energy tensor comes from the electromagnetic part , @xmath100 .",
    "allowing by maxwell equations , the total conservation of energy and momentum can be written as @xmath101 the vanishing of the lorentz force @xmath102 leads to an approximation known as force - free limit , which is valid only for magnetically dominated plasmas with negligible inertia .",
    "the spatial components of the force - free condition  ( [ div - stress - fluidem2 ] ) , after performing the 3 + 1 decomposition , are @xmath103 or , after some simple manipulations , @xmath104 where we have defined @xmath105 as the drift velocity .",
    "several options have been proposed to compute the term @xmath106 , which is crucial to provide a completely explicit relation for the current .",
    "for instance , a closed formed for the current can be calculated by enforcing the constraint @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "another option is to evolve maxwell equations by considering only the drift term of the current ( [ forcefree3 ] ) , and correct the electric field after each timestep to satisfy the other force - free condition @xmath108",
    "this approximation has been used successfully to study numerically pulsar magnetospheres @xcite and jets emerging from black holes with an externally sourced magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the numerical evolution of the ideal mhd equations typically fails in low density regions with high magnetization unless sufficient resolution is available , a situation that arises commonly in the magnetospheres .",
    "a standard practice to avoid these failures is to maintain a density floor ( i.e. , the so called _ atmosphere _ ) in regions of low density to exploit advanced numerical techniques for relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the density in the atmosphere is much smaller than that inside the star , so this approach does not affect the star s dynamics .",
    "however , in the magnetosphere the fluid inertia ( and pressure ) is typically much smaller than that of the electromagnetic field and one generally encounters numerical difficulties .",
    "these problems are mitigated by increasing the density in the atmosphere , effectively decreasing the magnetization in the exterior of the star .",
    "although these modifications produce an unphysical modeling of the plasma in the magnetosphere , one could still solve correctly maxwell equations by using a suitable current that decouples the electromagnetic fields from the fluid variables .",
    "as explained earlier , the covariant current ( [ ohm_relativistic_spatial ] ) reduces to the ideal mhd limit for high isotropic conductivities ( i.e. , @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) , while that the force - free constraint @xmath108 is enforced for large anisotropic conductivities ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) .",
    "this suggests that the solutions for the em fields in both limits can be achieved just by changing the anisotropic conductivity , independently on the plasma magnetization .",
    "although ohm s law  ( [ ohm_relativistic_spatial ] ) is quite general , it still couples the em fields to the velocity .",
    "in addition , the parameter @xmath116 is not appropriate to model the fast decay of the magnetic field with the distance to the source . to overcome these difficulties , and",
    "in part motivated by the strategy introduced in  @xcite , we introduce the following phenomenological current to include both the ideal mhd and the force - free limits , @xmath117   \\\\     & + & \\frac{\\sigma}{1 + \\zeta^2 }     \\left[{\\cal e}^i     + \\frac{\\zeta^2}{b^2 } \\ { ( e^k b_k ) b^i + \\chi ( e^2-b^2 ) e^i\\ } \\right]~ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is a function which vanishes whereas the ideal mhd limit is valid , and tends to @xmath119 whereas the force - free limit is more appropriate .",
    "the anisotropic ratio @xmath120 , which can be reinterpreted from the definition @xmath121 , can be conveniently set to be a constant in the region where the force - free limit is valid .",
    "the physical condition @xmath122 is enforced through a new current term proportional to an anomalous conductivity @xmath123 , which only appears whenever @xmath124 .",
    "overdamping of the electric field is avoided by setting this anomalous conductivity to the characteristic decay time @xmath125 , which can be estimated from the time evolution of @xmath126 .",
    "let us consider the particular astrophysical scenario of magnetized neutron stars .",
    "the large fluid conductivity , both inside and outside the star , is modeled by using a large constant @xmath127 .",
    "the anisotropic ratio , which defines the regions described either with the ideal mhd or the force - free limits , is defined as @xmath128 .",
    "this choice ensures that the interior of the star ( i.e. , @xmath129 ) is dominated by a large isotropic conductivity , reducing the system of equations to the ideal mhd limit .",
    "the exterior of the star ( i.e. , @xmath130 ) is dominated by the anisotropic terms which enforce the force - free condition .",
    "the kernel function @xmath118 is defined such that vanishes inside the star and its value becomes unity outside .",
    "a smooth transition between the inner and the outer region is achieved by using @xmath131 we typically adopt @xmath132 and @xmath133 , being @xmath134 the value for the density of the magnetosphere .",
    "the general system of relativistic resistive mhd equations ( [ maxwell11]-[fluid13],[ohm_ideal_forcefree ] ) brings about a delicate issue when the conductivity in the plasma undergoes very large spatial variations . in regions with high conductivity ,",
    "in fact , the system will evolve on timescales which are very different from those in the low - conductivity region .",
    "mathematically , therefore , the problem can be regarded as a hyperbolic system with relaxation terms which requires special care to capture the dynamics in a stable and accurate manner .",
    "the prototype of these systems can be written as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the relaxation time . in the limit @xmath137",
    "the system is hyperbolic with spectral radius @xmath138 ( i.e. , the absolute value of the maximum eigenvalue ) . in the other limit @xmath139",
    "the system is clearly stiff since the time scale of the relaxation ( or stiff term ) @xmath140 is much smaller than the maximum speed @xmath138 of the hyperbolic part @xmath141 .    in the stiff limit ( @xmath139 ) the stability of an explicit time evolution scheme",
    "is only achieved with a time step size @xmath142 , a much stronger restriction than the cfl condition @xmath143 of the hyperbolic systems .",
    "the development of stable and efficient numerical schemes to overcome this restrictive constraint is challenging , since in many applications the relaxation time can vary many orders of magnitude .",
    "different alternatives to deal with the inherent stiffness of the relativistic resistive mhd equations has been proposed in the last decade ; combination of splitting methods and analytical solutions  @xcite , discontinuous galerkin methods  @xcite and implicit - explicit ( imex ) runge - kutta methods  @xcite .",
    "the following subsections summarize the imex runge - kutta schemes , a family of time integrators which are able to deal with the potentially stiffness issues and are relatively easy to incorporate into an existing relativistic ideal mhd code .      an efficient way to solve the hyperbolic - relaxation systems is based on the imex runge - kutta methods . within this scheme , all the fields",
    "are evolved by using a standard explicit time integration except the potentially stiff terms , which are evolved with an implicit time discretization . for the generic system ( [ stiff_equation ] ) this scheme takes the form  @xcite @xmath144 where @xmath145 are the auxiliary intermediate values of the runge - kutta .",
    "the coefficients can be represented as @xmath146 matrices @xmath147 and @xmath148 such that the resulting scheme is explicit in @xmath149 ( i.e.,@xmath150 for @xmath151 ) and implicit in @xmath87 .",
