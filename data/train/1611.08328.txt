    "these results were extended for most other surfaces of finite topological type by korkmaz and luo in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "+ later on , irmak ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , behrstock and margalit ( see @xcite ) , and shackleton ( see @xcite ) generalised these results for larger classes of simplicial maps .",
    "in particular , shackleton s result implies that any locally injective self - map of the curve graph is induced by a homeomorphism for surfaces of high - enough complexity . + thereafter , aramayona and leininger introduced in @xcite the concept of a rigid set of the curve graph ( described below in a more general setting ) and construct a finite rigid set for any orientable surface of finite topological type .",
    "afterwards , they introduce in @xcite a way of creating supersets from given sets , such that the supersets are capable of inheriting the property of being rigid ( which is not trivial ) .",
    "this method is called the _ rigid expansion _ of a set in @xcite and @xcite due to this property .",
    "+ in this article we use techniques similar to those shown in @xcite along with simplicial properties of the rigid expansions to obtain the following result , recalling that the complexity of a surface is denoted by @xmath12 .",

    "note that in the context of graph theory , an edge - preserving map is a graph homomorphism .",
    "thus , with theorem [ theob ] we generalise ( for surfaces of genus at least @xmath2 ) shackleton s result which requires the maps to be locally injective ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ to prove theorem [ theob ] , in section [ chap3 ] we first take the simplicial interpretation of a rigid expansion and generalise it to the setting of abstract simplicial graphs : + let @xmath18 be a connected simplicial graph , @xmath19 be a vertex of @xmath18 and @xmath20 be a set of vertices of @xmath18 .",

    "see section [ chap3 ] below for more details .",
    "+ in this general setting , theorem [ theoc ] below tells us in particular that given a simplicial map from a connected full subgraph @xmath21 to @xmath18 that coincides with the restriction to @xmath21 of an automorphism , the only way to extend it to @xmath25 so that the extended map is at least edge - preserving , is via said automorphism of @xmath18 .",
    "[ theoc ] let @xmath18 be a connected simplicial graph , @xmath21 be a connected full subgraph of @xmath18 , and @xmath28 be an edge - preserving map such that there exists an automorphism @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 , and any other @xmath32 with @xmath33 differs from @xmath34 by an element in @xmath35 .    similarly , we can also generalise the concept of a rigid set : we say a full subgraph @xmath21 of @xmath18 is a _",
    "rigid set _ if any locally injective map @xmath36 is the restriction of some automorphism of @xmath18 . with this definition and theorem [ theoc ]",
    "we have the following corollary :    [ corod ] let @xmath18 be a connected simplicial graph , @xmath21 be a rigid set of @xmath18 , and @xmath37 be an edge - preserving map such that @xmath38 is locally injective .",

    "one of the objectives of theorem [ theoc ] and corollary [ corod ] , is to give a way to obtain new results on the combinatorial rigidity problem of various simplicial graphs ( e.g. the pants graph , the hatcher - thurston graph , etc . ) , by one of two ways : either by finding ( suitable ) subgraphs for which it can be proved that the simplicial map is induced by an automorphism of the graph , and proving that the rigid expansion of the subgraph exhaust the original graph ( so we can use theorem [ theoc ] ) ; or by finding ( preferably finite ) rigid sets in them where the restriction of the simplicial map is locally injective , and proving that the rigid expansions of the rigid sets exhaust the graph ( so we can use corollary [ corod ] ) .",
    "note that due to the abstract setting of the theorem , this * need not * be done exclusively for simplicial graphs associated to a surface ; we hope in the future to use this theorem to find analogous results to those of the curve graph on various complexes associated to other structures , e.g. the various complexes associated to the outer automorphism group of a free group of finite rank .",

    "we take advantage of the relation between the curve graph and the topology of the underlying surface , along with the previous corollary ( corollary [ thm4 ] ) , to prove theorem [ theob ] .",
