    "studying the computational power of restricted sets of operations can shed light on the nature of quantum speedup . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", such studies can determine what resources are necessary and/or sufficient for universal quantum computation .",
    "this issue is also relevant in experimental settings , where available operations or resources may be restricted .    in this paper , we focus on the class of operations known as matchgates .",
    "matchgates are a class of @xmath0-qubit gates defined by valiant @xcite that are closely related to noninteracting fermions @xcite . to define matchgates , let @xmath1 denote the unitary gate that acts as unitaries @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , on the even- and odd - parity subspaces of a 2-qubit hilbert space : @xmath4 the gate",
    "@xmath1 is a _ matchgate _ if @xmath5 .    as originally shown by valiant @xcite , and soon after by terhal and divincenzo @xcite in the setting of fermionic linear optics , a quantum computation composed only of ( i ) qubits ( arranged on a path ) initially prepared in a product state , ( ii ) a circuit of nearest - neighbor matchgates , and ( iii ) a final measurement in the computational basis can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer .",
    "curiously , the computational power of matchgates varies greatly with seemingly small changes in spatial restrictions : by relaxing the nearest - neighbor condition and allowing matchgates to also act on next - nearest neighbors , they become universal for quantum computation , as shown by kempe , bacon , divincenzo , and whaley @xcite .",
    "both regimes were revisited and extended by jozsa and miyake @xcite , who also provided simpler proofs .",
    "more generally , one can consider matchgates restricted to act on pairs of qubits joined by the edges of any graph . in @xcite it was shown that matchgates can implement universal quantum computation on many graphs , such as a complete binary tree , a star , or a path with one extra vertex appended to some point , and the authors suggested that the path might be a pathological instance where matchgates are classically simulable .",
    "the authors also left as an open question whether there is a regime of intermediate computational power , between that of classical and quantum computers , such as in recent proposals using commuting operators @xcite or linear optics @xcite .",
    "here we use ideas from @xcite to prove that matchgates are universal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle .",
    "we also adapt previous results @xcite to show that matchgates are classically simulable on a cycle .",
    "thus we completely characterize the power of matchgates on arbitrary graphs , resolving the two open questions from @xcite .    furthermore , we consider the computational power of the xy ( or anisotropic heisenberg ) interaction acting on the edges of a graph .",
    "the xy interaction generates matchgates , so it is non - universal on paths @xcite and cycles .",
    "in fact , even this restricted class of matchgates is universal when acting on next - nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "here we show that the xy interaction is also universal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle , so it is as powerful as general matchgates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in we",
    "review the proof of universality of matchgates acting on nearest and next - nearest neighbors on a path , focusing on ideas used in our first main result . in we present two instructive examples from @xcite that lead to the proof , in , that matchgates are universal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle . in",
    "we review the classical simulation of matchgates on a path , and in we show how this result can be adapted to provide an equivalent result for matchgates acting on a cycle .",
    "finally , in we specialize the result of and show that the subset of matchgates known as the xy interaction is also universal on any graph other than a path or cycle .",
    "although this latter result implies the first , we present the results separately as the first proof is easier and develops tools that are useful later , while the simulation using the xy interaction is less explicit .",
    "* notation and terminology . * throughout this paper we consider matchgates acting on the edges of a graph , unless stated otherwise , and we refer to `` universal graphs '' as those on which such matchgates are universal .",
    "we restrict our attention to connected graphs without loss of generality , as qubits in different components of a general graph can not interact , so the components can be treated separately . by a universal gate set we mean a set that can simulate a universal quantum computer with at most polynomial overhead in number of operations and number of qubits .",
    "we extensively use the concept of encoded universality ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where one logical qubit is encoded in two or more physical qubits , so we occasionally denote logical basis states or logical operators that act on an encoded space by a subscript @xmath6 when there is risk of ambiguity",
    ". we also interchangeably refer to a set of quantum gates by their unitary matrices or their generating hamiltonians , as we will not consider the case of discrete sets of unitaries .",
    "we begin by giving a simple proof , along the lines of @xcite , that matchgates are universal on a path when supplemented by the 2-qubit @xmath7 gate .",
    "consider an encoding of a logical qubit into two physical qubits , given by @xmath8    clearly an encoded single - qubit gate @xmath9 can be implemented simply by applying the matchgate @xmath10 to the pair of physical qubits that encode the logical qubit .",
    "the other requirement for a universal set is an entangling 2-qubit gate , such as the controlled-@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) gate .",
    "consider two adjacent logical qubits encoded in physical pairs labeled @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "then a @xmath15 between the logical qubits can be implemented simply by a @xmath12 between the neighboring qubits 2 and 3 .",
    "note that this is not a matchgate  indeed , no nearest - neighbor matchgate can generate entanglement while preserving the encoding of @xcite , as this would contradict that matchgates are classically simulable when acting on a path .",
    "therefore the entangling gate must be implemented with the aid of some non - matchgate operation .",
    "one such example is the sequence @xmath16 here @xmath17 is not a matchgate .",
    "the closely related gate @xmath18 is a matchgate that swaps the two qubits and induces a minus sign when both are in the @xmath19 state ( so we call it the fermionic @xmath7 ) . in",
    "we can interpret the @xmath7 as undoing an undesired interchange of the qubits induced by the @xmath20 during the entangling operation .",
    "we thus conclude that matchgates , when supplemented by the @xmath7 , form a universal set .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath7 is only applied on disjoint sets of physical qubits ( i.e. , @xmath21 for @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the total number of logical qubits ) , so no qubit is swapped more than one position away from its original place @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath7 gate in this construction can be replaced by allowing matchgates to also act on second and third neighbors on the path .",
    "in fact , matchgates between only nearest and next - nearest neighbors are already universal , as shown in @xcite and @xcite using alternative encodings , where each logical qubit is encoded into @xmath24 and @xmath25 physical qubits , respectively .",
    "now suppose that the qubits are arranged on the vertices of a more general ( connected ) graph , and matchgates can act between every neighboring pair of qubits . henceforth , we restrict ourselves to interactions between nearest neighbors in these general graphs . in this",
    "setting , the result mentioned at the end of the previous section straightforwardly translates to the universality of the `` triangular ladder '' graph of @xcite .        in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", it was proven that matchgates are also universal on many other graphs .",
    "here we extend this result to show that matchgates are universal on any graph that is not a path or a cycle .    before giving the proof for the most general case , it is instructive to work through two cases that exemplify the main ideas .",
    "both examples are taken from @xcite with small adaptations .",
    "[ ex : path ] suppose the qubits are arranged according to a graph of the form shown in , which is obtained by joining a new vertex to some degree-2 vertex of a path .",
    "to prove that such a graph is universal , we use two tricks from @xcite .    -vertex graph obtained from an @xmath26-vertex path by joining a new vertex to some degree-@xmath0 vertex of the original path.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    first , suppose we have a logical qubit in an arbitrary state @xmath27 and a third physical qubit in any state @xmath28 .",
    "we then have the identity @xmath29 where @xmath30 is shorthand for the @xmath20 gate , and subscripts denote the pair being acted on .",
    "the above identity follows from the trivial observation that the logical qubit is always a superposition of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , so the @xmath20 gate either does not induce a minus sign , or does so twice .",
    "thus , the @xmath20 can replace the @xmath7 provided it exchanges a complete logical qubit .",
    "note that , by linearity , this holds even if the logical state of qubits @xmath33 and @xmath0 is entangled with other logical qubits , as long as it is a physical state of even parity .",
    "the second trick is the identity @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the state of any physical qubit .",
    "this follows simply because when either of the qubits is in the @xmath36 state , the @xmath20 does not induce a minus sign , behaving exactly as the @xmath7 .",
    "we will use this fact to initialize some ancilla qubits in the @xmath36 state and move them around as necessary .",
    "we now prove universality for .",
    "first note that the graph of is guaranteed to appear as a subgraph of the one in if the number of vertices is greater than @xmath37 .",
    "we refer to the degree-@xmath24 vertex in that graph  and more generally , to any vertex of degree greater than @xmath0 in a tree  as a branching point .",
    "we initialize two ancilla qubits near the branching point ( specifically , at vertices @xmath38 and @xmath39 in ) as @xmath36 and encode the logical qubits using pairs of adjacent qubits as in . depending on the number of vertices and the location of the branching point",
    ", some physical qubits might be unpaired , in which case one or two qubits at the endpoints may not be used .",
    "vertex of the graph in .",
    "vertices labeled @xmath38 and @xmath39 correspond to ancillas initialized in the @xmath36 state .",
    "vertex pairs @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond to the two logical qubits on which we want to implement a logical @xmath12 gate .",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 ancillas are used to change the order of the state of the other qubits , as per .,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    as discussed above , a logical single - qubit gate @xmath2 can be implemented simply by a @xmath10 matchgate between adjacent qubits .",
    "now say we want to implement a logical @xmath12 gate between two ( not necessarily adjacent ) logical qubits .",
    "we first use the identity of to place the two desired pairs near the branching point , as in . in the previous section",
    ", we mentioned that the logical @xmath12 can be implemented by a physical @xmath12 between two of the four qubits ( e.g. , @xmath33 and @xmath24 , as labeled in ) , which in turn is equal to @xmath7 followed by @xmath20 .",
    "we can implement this sequence by swapping qubit @xmath0 with both qubits of the pair ( @xmath24,@xmath25 ) , which is possible by , and then using the fact that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are ancillas in the @xmath36 state to switch the order of the qubits placed in vertices @xmath33 and @xmath0 .",
    "this effectively implements the @xmath7 of .",
    "if we follow this with an @xmath20 again between qubits @xmath33 and @xmath0 , the final result is the desired @xmath12 gate . we can then use to return all qubits to their original places .",
    "the explicit sequence is @xmath40    this sequence uses only matchgates to implement a @xmath12 between the logical qubits which , together with the single - qubit gates mentioned previously , gives a universal set .",
    "since any logical qubit can be moved to any desired location using @xmath41 @xmath20 gates , the overhead in the number of such gates grows polynomially with the number of 2-qubit gates in the original circuit .",
    "[ ex : leaves ] now suppose the qubits are arranged on a complete binary tree of @xmath42 levels , as in .",
    "this graph has @xmath43 vertices .",
    "since the longest path contains only @xmath44 vertices , the strategy of can not be trivially adapted to this case : the number of available logical qubits would not be sufficient .",
    "-vertex complete binary tree .",
    "white vertices represent @xmath36 ancillas and black vertices are used in pairs to store computational qubits .",
    "this arrangement enables universal computing with matchgates.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    instead , we store logical qubits using the @xmath45 leaves as shown in . by using the leaves as the computational qubits and filling the paths that connect them with @xmath36 ancillas",
    ", we can use the identity of to move the state of any qubit to a vertex adjacent to any other desired qubit in less than @xmath46 steps , apply the desired matchgate between them , and return them to their initial positions .",
    "this means we can use the @xmath20 to implement an effective interaction between any pair among the @xmath47 computational qubits , which clearly is sufficient for universal computation , as per the construction of .",
    "the overhead of this approach is modest : it requires twice the number of qubits and uses @xmath48 @xmath20 operations per 2-qubit gate in the original circuit .",
    "note that this approach works for any pairing of physical into logical qubits .",
    "the two examples of the previous section provide the main ideas for a complete characterization of the power of matchgates on arbitrary graphs . to obtain this result , we first prove the following lemma :    [ lem : graph ] let @xmath49 be an @xmath23-vertex tree with @xmath50 leaves and a longest path of length @xmath51",
    ". then either ( i ) @xmath52 or ( ii ) @xmath53 .",
    "choose any leaf @xmath54 of @xmath49 .",
    "delete every vertex on the path from @xmath54 to the nearest branching point , not including the branching point ( see ) .",
    "since , by hypothesis , this path has length smaller than @xmath51 , the result is a subtree of @xmath49 where one leaf and at most @xmath55 vertices are removed . repeat this procedure until only a path remains ( i.e. , @xmath56 times ) . finally , delete the remaining path , removing the last two leaves and at most @xmath51 vertices .",
    "this process deletes every vertex in @xmath49 .",
    "therefore @xmath57 , so @xmath58 as claimed .",

    "the remaining tree has one fewer leaf , and at most @xmath55 vertices have been removed.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the main result follows straightforwardly from and the examples of the previous section :    [ thm : maintheo ] let @xmath59 be any @xmath23-vertex connected graph , other than a path or a cycle , where every vertex represents a qubit and we can implement arbitrary matchgates between neighbors in @xmath59 . then it is possible to efficiently simulate ( i.e. , with polynomial overhead in the number of operations ) any quantum circuit on @xmath60 qubits .",
    "since @xmath59 is not a path or a cycle , it has some spanning tree @xmath49 that is not a path .",
    "this holds because @xmath59 necessarily contains a vertex of degree more than 2 and one can construct a spanning tree that includes all edges adjacent to this vertex .",
    "it suffices to show that universal computation can be implemented in @xmath49 , since all edges of @xmath49 are edges of @xmath59 . by , either ( i ) the longest path of @xmath49 or ( ii ) the set of all its leaves must have more than @xmath61 vertices .",
    "first , suppose ( i ) holds .",
    "assign each qubit of a longest path of @xmath49 as a computational qubit , with the exception of one qubit at a branching point .",
    "we also use one qubit adjacent to the branching point and not in the path as an ancilla .",
    "all other qubits are ignored .",
    "we implement the circuit as shown in of the previous section .",
    "since the longest path has more than @xmath61 vertices by hypothesis , this allows the simulation of an arbitrary quantum circuit on @xmath62 qubits .",
    "this simulation uses @xmath41 @xmath20 operations for each two - qubit gate .",
    "otherwise ( ii ) holds , so @xmath49 has more than @xmath61 leaves .",
    "proceed by assigning every qubit at a leaf as a computational qubit and initializing every other qubit as a @xmath36 ancilla .",
    "the intermediate vertices on the ( unique ) path between any two leaves represent qubits in the @xmath36 state . as in",
    ", we can use the identity of to move the state of any qubit to a vertex adjacent to any other , implement a matchgate , and move it back .",
    "thus we can effectively implement any matchgate between any pair of logical qubits .",
    "since the longest path has length less than @xmath61 , this simulation uses @xmath63 @xmath20 operations for each gate in the original circuit .",
    "in the previous section , we proved the universality of matchgates on any connected graph that is not a path or a cycle . we now show that this is also a necessary condition ( assuming that quantum computers can not be efficiently simulated classically ) .",
    "as mentioned in , it is well - known that matchgates on a path can be simulated classically for any product state input and computational basis measurement @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the proof of this fact as shown in @xcite and then generalize the proof to the case of a cycle .",
    "we begin by defining the jordan - wigner operators @xcite acting on @xmath23 qubits : @xmath64 for @xmath65 , where @xmath66 denote the pauli @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath11 operators , respectively , acting on qubit @xmath69 . using this transformation , we can write @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "these two - qubit hamiltonians are precisely the generators of the group of nearest - neighbor matchgates @xcite .",
    "suppose that the circuit being simulated has an initial product state input @xmath74 , a sequence of nearest - neighbor matchgates , and a final measurement in the computational basis .",
    "to simulate the final measurement of qubit @xmath75 , it suffices to calculate of the expectation value @xmath76 = @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the unitary corresponding to the action of the matchgate circuit . to show that this can be calculated efficiently , we invoke the following ( cf .",

    ", the hamiltonians that generate nearest - neighbor matchgates are quadratic in the operators @xmath79 , so @xmath85    if @xmath86 is the number of matchgates in the circuit , @xmath87 can be calculated in @xmath88 time as the product of the rotations corresponding to each matchgate .",
    "also notice that the sum in has only @xmath89 terms .",
    "finally , note that @xmath35 is a product state , and any monomial @xmath90 is a tensor product of pauli matrices , as is clear from .",
    "thus , each term in the sum factors as a product of the form @xmath91 , which involves @xmath23 efficiently computable terms .",
    "since @xmath76 is a sum of a polynomial number of efficiently computable terms , it can be computed efficiently , which completes the proof of classical simulability of matchgates on a path .",
    "the result of the previous section does not immediately apply to the case of a cycle , which corresponds to applying periodic boundary conditions to a path , because a matchgate between the first and last qubits does not translate into a hamiltonian that is quadratic in the @xmath79s , and vice versa .",
    "for example , @xmath92 which is clearly not a matchgate , as it is a unitary operation acting on every qubit in the circuit",
    ".    note that still applies to the hamiltonian in even though it does not correspond to a matchgate .",
    "however , we do not have a straightforward way of writing the operators we need , such as @xmath93 , in terms of these quadratic operators .    to show that matchgates are simulable in this case nonetheless ,",
    "first consider the case where the input state @xmath35 is a computational basis state .",
    "suppose that @xmath35 has even parity ( e.g. , @xmath94 ) .",
    "matchgates preserve parity , so the state at any point in the computation has a well - defined ( even ) parity .",
    "now notice that @xmath95 is the operator that measures overall parity , so it acts as the identity on the even - parity subspace .",
    "this means that for any even - parity input we have the correspondence @xmath96 where the second equality is just .",
    "the equivalent equations for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are straightforward . since we have recovered a correspondence between matchgates on qubits @xmath33 and @xmath23 and quadratic hamiltonians ,",
    "the simulation can be carried out exactly as in .",
    "the case of an odd - parity input state ( e.g. , @xmath100 ) is analogous , except that the operator @xmath95 now acts as minus the identity , and we write @xmath101 and its equivalents for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .    now consider a general product input state @xmath35 .",

    "the expression above does not contain cross terms such as @xmath107 because @xmath90 preserves parity .",

    "in and , we investigated the computational power of the set of all matchgates on arbitrary graphs .",
    "we now consider the computational power of a restricted set of matchgates corresponding to the xy ( or anisotropic heisenberg ) interaction on arbitrary graphs .",

    "is @xmath120 which is simply the corresponding encoding on the odd - parity subspace .",
    "we also need to adapt some of the identities used in .",

    "first notice that the hamiltonians @xmath116 and @xmath117 are included ; this is without loss of generality , as they can be obtained as simple sequences of the remaining interactions , e.g. , @xmath143 where @xmath144 $ ] . by conjugating every element in @xmath145 by @xmath128",
    ", we obtain the set @xmath146 these are exactly the generators of the special orthogonal group @xmath147 .",
    "this can be seen by writing them down explicitly , but also understood by a counting argument , as @xmath148 contains six linearly independent , purely imaginary @xmath149 matrices .",
    "now we recall the well - known fact ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) that universal quantum computation is possible using only orthogonal , rather than general unitary , matrices , with the overhead of one extra ancilla qubit and a polynomial number of operations .",
    "furthermore , any special orthogonal matrix on @xmath23 qubits [ i.e. , in @xmath150 can be decomposed in terms of @xmath147 gates acting non - trivially only on pairs of qubits , so the set @xmath148 is universal for quantum computation . but",
    "this means that the set @xmath145 is also universal , since we can assume that initialization and measurements are done in the computational basis , so the initial and final single - qubit @xmath151 gates do not affect the outcomes .",
    "while the graph in a may not appear as a subgraph of the given graph , the sequence can be easily adapted to the graph of c. in that case , we can just use to swap the ancilla with any of the other qubits and obtain a similar arrangement to that of b. the corresponding sequence is @xmath152 \\ , { \\textrm{i}\\textsc{s}}_{24}^\\dagger.\\ ] ] in this case , every operation described before is obtained up to conjugation by @xmath128 , and the set of available operations is @xmath148 , rather than @xmath145 .",
    "however , as described above , this still suffices for universal computation .",
    "it remains to show that , for any graph other than a path or cycle , we can assign sufficiently many vertices as computational qubits and swap them around to one of the arrangements of with a polynomial number of operations .",
    "[ thm : maintheo2 ] let @xmath59 be any @xmath23-vertex connected graph , other than a path or a cycle , where every vertex represents a qubit and we can implement the interaction @xmath153 between any nearest neighbors in @xmath59 . then it is possible to efficiently simulate any quantum circuit on @xmath60 qubits .    as in",
    ", it suffices to prove the universality of @xmath119 on any @xmath23-vertex tree @xmath49 that is not a path .    by",
    ", either ( i ) the longest path of @xmath49 or ( ii ) the set of all its leaves must have more than @xmath61 vertices .",
    "suppose first that ( i ) holds .",
    "then the universal construction is directly analogous to case ( i ) of .",
    "simply assign pairs of adjacent vertices on the longest path as logical qubits , and every other as a @xmath36 ancilla .",
    "then , by using , we can swap any two logical qubits to the closest degree-3 vertex , where we use sequence to implement the @xmath141 hamiltonian as per a. as explained previously , this together with the logical @xmath67 hamiltonian on any qubit ( given by @xmath119 on adjacent qubits ) enables universal computation with overhead of at most @xmath41 @xmath121 operations per orthogonal matrix in the original circuit of @xcite .",
    "otherwise , ( ii ) holds .",
    "then , first suppose that @xmath49 is not a star .",
    "any such @xmath49 contains the graph of a as a subgraph , so we assign those @xmath137 vertices as @xmath36 ancillas , together with all non - leaves , and pair the remaining leaves arbitrarily into computational qubits .",
    "we can now use to bring the states of any two logical qubits to the structure of a , but with one caveat : this process may induce an overall @xmath128 gate on some logical qubits , depending on whether an odd or even number of @xmath36 ancillas is traversed .",
    "this separates the logical qubits into two disjoint sets , namely those that suffer an overall @xmath128 gate and those that do not ( there is no need to single out the case where the qubits suffer an overall @xmath139 , as this can be prevented by using @xmath121@xmath154 , rather than @xmath121 , as the swapping operation ) .",
    "we then take the larger of these two sets , which has at least @xmath155 logical qubits , and for simplicity we disregard the rest . on the remaining qubits , as argued previously , we can either implement the set of operations @xmath145 or its conjugated - by-@xmath128 version @xmath148 .",
    "since either set is universal , this gives an universal construction with an overhead of @xmath63 operations for each gate in the original circuit .",
    "finally , for the star graph , we replace sequence , corresponding to a , by the equivalent sequence corresponding to c. this enables us to implement the set of hamiltonians mentioned in the previous paragraph , and concludes the proof .",
    "we have completely characterized the computational power of nearest - neighbor matchgates when the qubits are arranged on an arbitrary graph .",
    "this continues a line of research started in @xcite , where the authors showed that matchgates are universal on many different graphs .",
    "here we proved that the only connected graphs for which matchgates are classically simulable are paths and cycles , whereas on any other connected graph they are universal for quantum computation .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the same dichotomy holds when we restrict matchgates to the proper subset described by the xy interaction .",
    "this further expands the exploration of quantum computation with a single physical interaction @xcite , and could have applications for a variety of physical systems where the xy interaction arises naturally , if the placement of the qubits is subject to geometrical constraints .",
    "this dichotomy excludes the possibility that these two sets of interactions ( general matchgates and the xy interaction ) , acting on graphs , could exhibit intermediate computational power such as that displayed by circuits of commuting observables ( iqp ) @xcite or noninteracting bosons @xcite .",
    "however , this does not rule out such a result for other subsets of matchgates . as one example ,",
    "consider the set generated by the @xmath115 hamiltonian acting on some graph .",
    "all such operations commute , and this set corresponds to a proper subclass of iqp .",
    "furthermore , it was recently shown @xcite that the set of two - qubit @xmath115 and single - qubit @xmath67 hamiltonians are hard to simulate classically , modulo plausible complexity - theoretic assumptions , in the same way as iqp .",
    "we leave as open questions whether an analogous result can be obtained by further restricting the operation to only the @xmath115 hamiltonian , or possibly some other proper subset of matchgates , and how the power of such a model depends on the underlying interaction graph .",
    "in our investigation we have not considered the use of non - trivial measurements to implement other unitary operations ",
    "it has been shown , for example , that noninteracting fermions ( i.e. , matchgates on a path ) become universal if nondestructive charge measurements are allowed @xcite .",
    "these charge measurements clearly can not be implemented by combining matchgates and computational basis measurements .",
    "it might be interesting to consider other measurements and/or input states , beyond those obtainable by matchgates , and understand whether they change the computational capabilities of restricted subsets of matchgates on graphs .",
    "while we have established universality of matchgates on any connected graph that is not a path or a cycle , it should be possible to improve the efficiency of our constructions .",
    "we have taken an operational approach , where each @xmath36 is seen as an `` empty space '' through which we can move logical qubits , allowing for a simple and unified proof of universality for all graphs . in some cases , such as for the star graph , where all vertices but one are leaves , this construction is optimal .",
    "but in many others , our construction could ignore many vertices and/or edges , making it far from optimal .",
    "one such case is the binary tree of , where we could have filled most of the non - leaves with logical qubits and used rather than whenever it was necessary to `` move '' two logical qubits through each other . since the bounds of are tight ( e.g. , consider the graph obtained from a @xmath61-leaf star by subdividing each edge @xmath61 times ) , an optimal simulation presumably requires a more efficient assignment of logical qubits than in .",
    "we believe that , while being markedly non - optimal in some cases , our construction nevertheless provides powerful tools for case - by - case optimization . we leave it as an open question whether there is a way to systematically obtain a more efficient construction , and in particular , whether in every case only a constant fraction of the qubits must be discarded as non - computational .",
