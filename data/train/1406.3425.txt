    "in recent years , the demand for the development of clean and renewable energy sources is very urgent , because the natural resources are diminishing and their burning contributes to the global warming .",
    "thermoelectric materials have attracted much attention because of their capability of converting heat directly into electricity and vice versa@xcite .",
    "the efficiency of thermoelectric devices is determined by the dimensionless figure - of - merit ( @xmath5 ) , which depends on transport properties of the material such as the seebeck coefficient ( @xmath6 ) , the electrical conductivity ( @xmath7 ) and thermal conductivity ( @xmath8 = @xmath9+@xmath10 ) and given by@xcite",
    "@xmath11    this equation suggests that , a high @xmath5 requires a large a large @xmath6 and @xmath7 and a low @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath6 for a metal or degenerate semiconductors is related with the effective mass ( @xmath12 ) by the following formula@xcite : @xmath13 where boltzmann constant , @xmath14 and electronic charge , @xmath15 are constants and hence at fixed temperature @xmath16 , @xmath6 depends on @xmath17 and @xmath12 .",
    "this equation implies that the @xmath6 will be more in the materials whose @xmath12 is large .",
    "most of the heusler alloys have half metallic ground state with @xmath18100 % spin - polarization at the fermi level ( @xmath19 ) where majority and minority spin channels usually show metallic and insulating behaviors , respectively .",
    "the minority spin channel of these compounds normally shows the presence of flat conduction band ( cb ) along @xmath1 - x direction@xcite .",
    "the presence of flat cb appears to be the generic property of the full heusler alloys .",
    "this flat band will give rise to the large value of @xmath12 and hence large value for @xmath6 corresponding to minority spin channel .",
    "recently , we have explored this aspect for co@xmath0mnge half - metallic full heusler alloy .",
    "our results also show the presence of flat cb along @xmath1 - x - direction in the spin down channel . at room temperature we got the calculated value of @xmath6 @xmath18",
    "-550 @xmath2v / k corresponds to the spin - down channel .",
    "this value was about 55 times more than that of the spin - up channel .",
    "however , the overall value of @xmath6 is found to be about 10 @xmath2v / k due to the presence of @xmath181000 times larger @xmath20 for up spin channel in comparison to down spin channel@xcite .",
    "this result clearly suggests that if the ground state of the full heusler alloys happens to be semiconducting then these alloys would have been a very good thermoelectric materials .",
    "the presence of semiconducting ground state for full heusler alloys is very rare @xcite .",
    "interestingly , yabuuchi et al.@xcite have predicted the presence of semiconducting ground state having very large @xmath6 for fe@xmath0tisn and fe@xmath0tisi compounds",
    ". the presence of semiconducting ground state also demands nonmagnetic ground state because of the slater - pauling rule . for full - heusler alloys",
    "this rule is given by the following equation@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is valence electron number per formula unit .",
    "it is clear from this formula that the magnetic moment vanishes for the compounds having valence electron number equal to 24 and these compounds are semimetallic or semiconducting@xcite .    in the search of the semiconducting full heusler alloys we come across with a new set of compounds viz .",
    "fe@xmath0scp , fe@xmath0scas and fe@xmath0scsb .",
    "these compounds have valence electron number equal to 24 and thus their total magnetic moment is expected to vanish as per slater - pauling rule . in the present work we study the electronic and transport properties of these compounds by using full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method based on density functional theory along with the boltzmann transport theory .",
    "first two compounds are found to be indirect band gap semiconductors whereas the last one have semimetallic ground state . as expected",
    "these compounds show almost flat conduction band along @xmath1 - x - direction .",
    "the indirect band gap of about 0.3 and 0.09 ev are found for fe@xmath0scp and fe@xmath0scas compounds .",
    "the undoped compounds show a very large and negative value of @xmath6 , which suggests that these heusler alloys are _ n_-type thermoelectric materials .",
    "also the power factor ( @xmath3 ) versus chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) plots give the qualitative information about the type of doping and suggests that the _ n_-type doping can further enhance the @xmath6 of these compounds .",
    "when fe@xmath0scp and fe@xmath0scas were doped heavily with electrons the @xmath3 of these materials found to be closer to the @xmath3 of bi@xmath0te@xmath4 .",
    "these materials offer good thermoelectric properties for the wide temperature range .",
    "further the calculations of the formation energy of these materials also suggest the possibility of synthesizing them in the laboratories .",
    "by combining the first principles calculations with the boltztrap code we have investigated the electronic and thermoelectric properties of new heusler alloys viz .",
    "fe@xmath0scp , fe@xmath0scas and fe@xmath0scsb .",
    "the electronic properties have been investigated by using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) method within the density functional theory ( dft ) implemented in wien2k code@xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation functional has been treated by employing the recently developed pbesol exchange - correlation functional @xcite .",
    "the muffin - tin radii were kept fixed to 2.0 bohr ( a@xmath23 ) for all atoms , except for sb , for which it was set equal to 2.2 a@xmath23 .",
    "the self - consistency iteration was achieved by demanding the convergence of total energy / cell and charge / cell of the system to be less than 10@xmath24 ry and 10@xmath25 electronic charge , respectively in every system .",
    "the transport properties calculations require the heavy k - point mesh in order to give more accurate results that is why the @xmath26 k - point mesh . to compute the transport properties of compounds ,",
    "the bolztrap code@xcite under the constant relaxation time approximation for the charge carriers was employed .",
    "the lpfac was equal to 5 , which represents the number of k - points per lattice point .",
    "the chemical potential in the calculation of transport properties was fixed to the middle of the gap in every case .",
    "normally , the full heusler compounds crystallize in l2@xmath27 crystal structure , with space group fm-3 m .",
    "therefore we have studied these compounds in the l2@xmath27 phase .",
    "the crystal structure of fe@xmath0scx , where x is atom of p , as or sb is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in this figure ,",
    "fe atoms are placed on the wyckoff position 8c ( 1/4 , 1/4 , 1/4 ) , sc atoms are placed on the wyckoff position 4a ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) and x atoms ( i.e. p , as and sb ) are located at the wyckoff position 4b ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) .",
    "the cubic l2@xmath27 structure consists of four interpenetrating fcc sublattices , two of which are equally occupied by fe atoms . in these compounds the two fe - site fcc sub - lattices ,",
    "combine to form a simple cubic sub - lattice .",
    "the sc and x atoms occupy alternatively , the centre of the simple cubic sub - lattice resulting in a cscl - type superstructure .    in order to obtain the equilibrium lattice parameters we have optimized the total energy as a function of volume of the cell .",
    "the obtained equilibrium lattice parameters for fe@xmath0scp , fe@xmath0scas and fe@xmath0scsb are 5.662 , 5.811 and 6.058  , respectively .",
    "the lattice parameter increases by about 7 % on moving from fe@xmath0scp to fe@xmath0scsb .",
    "this is due to the reason that as one moves down the group in the periodic table , the atomic size increases and hence there is an increment in the lattice parameters . using the equilibrium lattice parameters , firstly we have calculated the electronic properties of these compounds .",
    "the dispersion curves of fe@xmath0scp , fe@xmath0scas and fe@xmath0scsb are shown in the figure 2 .",
    "it is clear from the fig .",
    "2(a and b ) that fe@xmath0scp and fe@xmath0scas are semiconductors with indirect band gaps of about 0.3 and 0.09 ev , where the top of the valence band ( vb ) and bottom of the conduction band ( cb ) are at @xmath1 and x - point , respectively .",
    "in these materials the direct band gap is located at the @xmath1-point , which is @xmath180.05 and 0.01 ev more than the value of indirect band gap of fe@xmath0scp and fe@xmath0scas , respectively . thus at higher temperature both direct and indirect transitions",
    "are expected to contribute to the transport properties of these materials .",
    "the dispersion curve of fe@xmath0scsb is shown in fig.2 ( c ) . the cb edge at x - point is slightly lower in energy than the vb edge at @xmath1-point ( not visible from the scale shown here ) which make this compound semimetallic .",
    "the value of indirect band gap is found to decrease as one moves from the compound with p to the compound having sb .",
    "this is because of decrease in electronegativity and the amount of orbital overlap , as moving down the group in the periodic table . in these materials ,",
    "the sb is the least electronegative element and form the weakest covalent bonding with fe and thus band gap decreases from p to sb atom .",
    "the top of the vb in all compounds is triply degenerate at @xmath1-point . along @xmath1 to x - direction the degeneracy lifted and become doubly degenerate and non degenerate at x - point . along l - direction",
    "the degeneracy is lifted to doubly degenerate and non degenerate band .",
    "also along @xmath1 to x - direction there exist almost a flat conduction band in these compounds .",
    "thus these compounds surely have large value of effective mass which suggests that these materials are good thermoelectric materials .    the total density of states ( tdos ) and partial density of states ( pdos ) plots for fe@xmath0scp , fe@xmath0scas and fe@xmath0scsb are presented in the figure 3 .",
    "it is clear from the tdos , shown in fig .",
    "3(a - c ) that fe@xmath0scp and fe@xmath0scas are semiconductors , while in fe@xmath0scsb there is very small tdos at the fermi level ( e@xmath28 ) which is due to its semimetallic behavior of the compound as discussed above . in the vb region of these compounds",
    "two broad peaks with larger value of tdos are found in the region between -4.0 to 0 ev and two broad peaks with smaller intensity exist between -7.0 to -4.0 ev .",
    "the maxima of these peaks move towards the higher energy as going from fe@xmath0scp to fe@xmath0scsb .",
    "the pdos of fe atoms of fe@xmath0scp , fe@xmath0scas and fe@xmath0scsb are shown in fig .",
    "3(d - f ) .",
    "these plots show that the top of the valence band has mainly _ _",

    "the _ _ t__@xmath29 with very small contribution of _ _",
    "e__@xmath30 states are extended in two different regions from -5 to -4 ev and -4 to 0 ev . in the region -5 to -4 ev the intensity of peaks are very small and _ _ t__@xmath29 states have more contribution than the _ _ e__@xmath30 states .",
    "the contribution from _",
    "_ t__@xmath29 ( _ _ e__@xmath30 ) states of fe atom is 0.32 ( 0.14 ) , 0.30 ( 0.13 ) and 0.26 ( 0.14 ) states / ev / atom in fe@xmath0scp , fe@xmath0scas and fe@xmath0scsb , respectively .",
    "on moving from fe@xmath0scp to fe@xmath0scsb these two regions become narrow and maximum of the peaks shifts slightly towards the higher energy .",
    "the pdos of sc atom of fe@xmath0scp , fe@xmath0scas and fe@xmath0scsb are presented in fig .",
    "3(g - i ) .",
    "it is evident from the graphs that there is small contribution from the _ d _ orbitals of sc atom than that of fe atom .",
    "there are two broad peaks between -6 to -4 ev with smaller intensity and -3.5 to 0 ev having large intensity .",
    "the region nearer to the e@xmath28 has more contribution from the _ _",
    "t__@xmath29 and the region away from it is dominated by the _ _ e__@xmath30 states .",

    "the pdos for _ p _ orbitals of p , as and sb atoms are shown in fig .",
    "3(j - l ) .",
    "there are two broad peaks in the region between -7 to -4 ev and as one move from p to sb these peaks shift towards the higher energy .",
    "this trend is same as that is found in the atomic energy of _ p _ orbitals of these atoms .",
    "the trend in the atomic energy of 3__p _ _ ,",
    "4__p _ _ and 5__p _ _ orbitals of p , as and sb atom , respectively is -6.9 ev < -6.7 ev < -6.3 ev . in the pdos plot of fe and sc atoms the very small peaks are appearing in the low energy region between -7 to -4 ev which are essentially due to the hybridization between the _ p _ orbitals of p , as and sb with the _ d _ orbitals of fe and sc . this can be understood from the crystal structure shown in fig .",
    "this figure shows that the fe atom is lying at the wyckoff position 8c ( 1/4 , 1/4 , 1/4 ) , thus there is more hybridization between the _ _ t__@xmath29 of fe atom and _ p_-orbitals of x atom in comparison to the _ _ e__@xmath30 orbitals .",
    "the sc atoms are at origin and as atoms are lying at 4b ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) .",

    "the presence of semiconducting ground state and flat cb , clearly suggest that they have potential to be used as a good thermoelectric materials .",

    "the computed transport coefficients of fe@xmath0scp , fe@xmath0scas and fe@xmath0scsb for chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) ranging from -0.6 to 0.6 ev at different temperatures are shown in the figure 4 . the dashed line at @xmath2 = 0 ev represents the chemical potential for pure compound and was fixed to the middle of the gap .",
