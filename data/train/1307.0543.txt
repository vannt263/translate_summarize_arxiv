    "the description of nonlinear stochastic systems can hardly be carried out without approximations due to the interplay of noise and nonlinearity . in some problems ,",
    "the stationary distribution for the relevant variables is available in analytical form , but in general very little information can be obtained without approximations . a convenient way of describing the system dynamics is in term of cumulant moments satisfying an infinite set of coupled ordinary differential equations @xcite . for all practical purposes ,",
    "this infinite hierarchy needs to be truncated in order to obtain a finite set of closed equations .",
    "a very much used approximation consists in truncating the infinite hierarchy at the gaussian level by neglecting cumulants of order three and higher . for a stochastic variable @xmath0",
    ", marcinkiewicz @xcite indicated that the characteristic function @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a polynomial of first or second degree in @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , as pointed out by hnggi and talkner @xcite , the truncation of the hierarchy at levels higher than two is problematic , although , as these authors emphasize , it is not an empty concept . in their own words",
    "`` it only means that the neglect of cumulants beyond a given order can not be justified a priori '' .    in this work",
    "we consider the statistical mechanical description of a stochastic array containing a small finite number @xmath5 of coupled identical elements .",
    "the dynamics will be given by a set of @xmath5 coupled nonlinear stochastic differential equations for the degrees of freedom characterizing the elements of the array .",
    "equivalently , we can describe the system in terms of an @xmath5-dimensional joint probability distribution .",
    "we will assume that this joint probability distribution satisfies an @xmath5-dimensional linear fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) .",
    "obtaining dynamical information from the fpe is plagued with difficulties due to the nonlinear character of the dynamics .",
    "as mentioned above , a way of dealing with them is to consider the cumulant moments satisfying an infinite hierarchy of ordinary differential equations . in the case of the arrays studied in this work , desai and",
    "zwanzig @xcite derived from the fpe such an infinite hierarchy .",
    "two types of cumulants appear : diagonal cumulant moments associated to a single degree of freedom , @xmath6 , and cross cumulant moments , @xmath7 involving two or more variables . for an infinite system , the off - diagonal cumulant moments are negligible if they were zero at the initial preparation ( see @xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "off - diagonal cumulant moments are not generated by dynamical evolution in the case of infinitely large systems .",
    "but even then , for all practical purposes , the hierarchy has to be approximated by truncating it at a certain level .",
    "the results of truncating at different levels the hierarchy of diagonal cumulant moments in the @xmath8 limit was already discussed by desai and zwanzig . as also indicated in @xcite ,",
    "the cumulant truncation is a succesful strategy in that limit .",
    "by contrast with the previous work of desai and zwanzig , the present work focuses on systems with a small number @xmath5 of elements . in this case , both the diagonal and off - diagonal cumulant moments have to be taken into account .",
    "it is then an open question whether truncating the infinite hierarchy is an adequate approximation strategy .",
    "it is not possible to solve analytically the truncated set of equations at any level .",
    "so we will rely on a numerical treatment of the set .",
    "our goal is to elucidate whether truncation of the infinite hierarchy of cumulant moments at different levels provides a reliable approximation for small finite arrays . to this end",
    ", we will compare the results for the first few cumulant moments obtained from the truncated hierarchy with those obtained by numerically solving the set of the @xmath5 coupled langevin equations . besides the numerical simulations of the langevin dynamics",
    ", the results of the truncated hierarchy will also be contrasted with the exact results expected from the stationary solution of the @xmath5-dimensional fokker - planck equation , as well as the global stability h - theorem .",
    "we will see that the simulation results agree with the exact known information , while the truncation strategy might lead to results incompatible with the exact results .",
    "we consider a global coupling model that can be viewed as a set of nonlinear  oscillators \" , each of them described by a  coordinate \" @xmath9 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is given by the set of coupled langevin equations ( in dimensionless form ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the strength of the global coupling term .",
    "this parameter will be taken to be either positive or negative .",
    "the terms @xmath12 represent @xmath5 uncorrelated gaussian white noises with zero averages and @xmath13 .",
    "this model was introduced by kometani and shimizu @xcite as a model for muscle contractions , and it was later on analyzed by desai and zwanzig @xcite from a statistical mechanics perspective .",
    "the model describes @xmath5 degrees of freedom each of them globally coupled to all the other ones .",
    "each degree of freedom has an intrinsic nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the nonlinearity and the presence of the noise terms render the behavior of the system far from trivial .",
    "an alternative formulation of the dynamics is in terms of the linear fokker - planck equation for the joint probability density @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the potential energy relief , @xmath17 with the single particle potential @xmath18 the term @xmath19 describes a symmetrical potential with two wells of equal depths separated by a hump at @xmath20 .",
    "the interaction part of the full potential modifies it in such a way that for @xmath21 the two wells blend into a single minimum at @xmath20 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the two wells exist , but their locations and the barrier height depend on @xmath11 .",
    "note that for @xmath23 , the interaction energy contribution to the full potential favors that any pair @xmath9 and @xmath24 should have the same sign ( both either positive or negative ) , while for @xmath25 , the opposite happens and the interaction tends to favor configurations with positive and negative values of the variable .    the only explicit solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is its long time stationary one , given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a normalization function .",
    "this solution is independent of the initial condition , and the system will necessarily relax to it , although the time it takes to do it might be , depending on the system parameters , extremely large .",
    "it should be noted that we keep the finite number of particles @xmath5 fixed , while we take the long time limit .",
    "had we have taken the limit @xmath28 first , as done in the infinite size limit studies , and afterwards the long time limit , the result would differ .",
    "as mentioned above , desai and zwanzig @xcite derived an infinite hierarchy of ordinary differential equations for the cumulant moments . neglecting the cumulant moments of order five and higher",
    "one gets a set of 11 equations for the first four order ( diagonal and off - diagonal ) cumulant moments ( see the appendix in @xcite ) . for asymptotically large systems ( @xmath29 ) , desai and zwanzig found that , for some regions of parameter space , zero is the only stationary value for the first cumulant moment . for other regions of parameter values ,",
    "there are two stable nonzero stationary values , while the zero value becomes unstable .",
    "the regions are separated by a transition line whose shape depends on whether @xmath30 or @xmath31 . as we will see in the next section , the truncated hierarchy of cumulants for small systems might yield several stable stationary moments depending upon the initial preparation , as obtained within the @xmath29 limit",
    "nonetheless , those results are incompatible with the unicity of the solution of a multidimensional linear fpe and with the independence from initial condition of the long - time results , required by the h - theorem .",
    "we have carried out numerical simulations of the whole set of langevin equations , eq .",
