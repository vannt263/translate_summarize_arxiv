    "calculations of bound states of two - body systems have been approached by several methods . in the hamiltonian approaches the fermion - antifermion or two - fermion wave function satisfies two wave equations or @xmath1 matrix dirac equations which are generalizations of the dirac equation relative to each particle of the interacting system ( see [ 1 - 3 ] and references therein ) .",
    "systematic descriptions of the two - body system are based on quantum field theory ( qft ) . here",
    "the starting point is the bethe - salpeter or dyson - schwinger equation ( see [ 4 - 14 ] and references therein ) . to solve the equation analytic methods",
    "have been used by reducing it , with appropriate hypothesis , to a three - dimensional wave equation . in this respect",
    "the quasipotential approaches involve the use of delta - function constraints on the relative four - momentum [ 7 ] .",
    "it is well known that the obtained results for bound states of the electron - proton and electron - positron systems are close to the spinless case [ 6,15 ] and reproduce the eigenvalues of the schrodinger equation with the coulomb interaction potential which are corrected by certain relativistic and spin contributions @xmath2",
    "( @xmath3 is the fine structure constant ) [ 16,17 ] .",
    "although the eigenvalues obtained for the electron - positron system , are close to the spinless case [ 6,15 ] , the approaches reproduce two important effects , namely , that the singlet state is more bound that the triplet , and the fine - structure splitting has the correct order of magnitude @xmath4 ( @xmath3 is the fine structure constant ) [ 16,17 ] .    here",
    "we note the following circumstance .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation contains the free two - fermion propagator which is reduced to the product of the two free single - fermion propagators , as shown , for example , in [ 7 ] ) . in qft",
    "the free single - fermion propagator is defined as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the vacuum ground state ; @xmath7 is the fermionic field operator and @xmath8 is the conjugate operator .    at present , the dirac conjugation is commonly used in qft : @xmath9 .",
    "then this free single - fermion propagator coincides with the green function for the dirac differential equation [ 18 ] .",
    "the latter is defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the dirac matrixes in the standard representation [ 16 ] and @xmath12 is the mass of the particle .",
    "thus , the free single - fermion propagator in qft is adopted to be identical with the green function for the dirac equation .",
    "this propagator is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the green function for the klein - gordon differential equation which describes bosons : @xmath15 here @xmath16 .",
    "note the minus between the two pole functions in eq .",
    "it is due to the commutative relations for bosons .",
    "the same structure of the green functions exists for all bose particles , for example , for phonons in solids , of course with account of differences in pole amplitudes and , respectively , in spectral densities .    in principle",
    ", the free fermionic propagator ( 1 ) has also the boson - type structure in the sense of the minus between the two pole functions . in the nonrelativistic limit when @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ", we have : @xmath19 and the free single - fermion propagator ( 1 ) transforms to the free single - boson propagator ( 2 ) .",
    "it is not unexpected because any solution for the dirac equation is also the solution for the klein - gordon equation .",
    "thus , there is a very strange result in qft that the free particle propagator does not depend on particle s statistics in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "however , according to the lehmann spectral representation [ 19 ] , the pole amplitudes of the fermion propagators must be positive in all regions of the pole spectrum . unlike boson propagators",
    ", the exact single - fermion propagator can be presented in the form ( [ 19 ] and see also [ 20 ] ) : @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are real and positive .",
    "thus , we point out that the bare single - fermion propagator used in the qft approach to the two - fermion problem , 1 ) has the bosonic structure ; 2 ) transforms to the boson propagator for the klein - gordon equation in the nonrelativistic limit ; 3 ) does not satisfy lehmann s representation for fermions .    in the present paper",
    "we attempt to study the bound states of the two - fermion system . proceeding from the lippmann - schwinger integral equation ,",
    "we obtain a two - fermion relativistic wave equation in which the free two - fermion equal - time propagator satisfying the lehmann representation , is used .",
    "we apply this theoretical formalism to the electron - positron system .",
    "we omit spin interactions in the system which give small relativistic and annihilation corrections @xmath2 to the energy levels of positronium . the main result",
    ", we would like to point out here , is the possibility of unusual bound eigenstates for the electron - positron system .",
    "we show that in addition to the positronium states , the wave equation describes the deep bound state with the binding energy @xmath23 and the exponential damping radius of the wave function @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the compton length of the electron ) .",
    "it is essential that similar deep bound states can not exist for two interacting spinless particles .",
    "units @xmath26 are used .",
    "we consider a system of interacting two fermions with the masses @xmath27 and charges @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the wave function of a bound state of the two - fermion system . then , according to quantum theory of scattering , this wave function should satisfy the lippmann - schwinger integral equation [ 21 ] : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the interaction between the particles ; @xmath33 is the total energy of the system ; @xmath34 is the fourier component of the free two - particle equal - time propagator : @xmath35 where @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the fermionic field operator for the @xmath38 particle which can be written as [ 16 ] : @xmath39 for free wave functions we use : @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 ; @xmath43 and @xmath44 are orthonormal spin functions .",
    "the commutation rules for the operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the same as for fermions .",
    "henceforth , we neglect the spin interaction , and the spin parts in ( 7 ) are omitted .",
    "we define the vacuum state @xmath6 by : @xmath47 then @xmath48 @xmath49 the latter can be treated as a filled negative - energy sea .    substituting ( 5)-(7 ) into ( 4 ) and taking into account ( 8)",
    ", we find : @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53    note that all the pole functions in @xmath34 ( 9 ) have equal positive - definite amplitudes .",
    "thus , the equation ( 3 ) with ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) is the integral two - fermion wave equation . in the case",
    "when no constraint between @xmath54 and @xmath55 exists , this integral wave equation can be reduced to the following differential equation : @xmath56 @xmath57 \\xi({\\bf r}_{1 } , { \\bf r}_{2})=\\ ] ] @xmath58 v({\\bf r}_{1}-{\\bf r}_{2})\\xi({\\bf r}_{1 } , { \\bf r}_{2}),\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "in the limit @xmath61 , this differential equation has the four solutions @xmath62 for the plane wave functions ( 7 ) . here",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath63 are independent .",
    "these solutions correspond to the all poles of the propagator ( 9)-(10 ) .",
    "so , one can see that the negative - energy part is not removed in the approach .    to find solutions of the equation for the bound states , it is convenient to transform to coordinates in which the center - of - mass coordinate is separated out .",
    "the wave function of bound states can be presented in the form : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the radius - vector between the particles ; @xmath66 is the radius - vector of the center - of - mass system and @xmath67 is the wave vector of free motion of the bound system .",

    "( 17 ) we obtain the integral equation for the bound states : @xmath83 @xmath84    it can be easily shown that the integral equation ( 18 ) with account of ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) corresponds to the following differential equation for the eigenstates of the two - fermion system : @xmath85 @xmath86 \\xi({\\bf r},{\\bf g})=\\ ] ] @xmath87 v({\\bf r})\\xi({\\bf r},{\\bf g}),\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the solution of eq .",
    "( 16 ) and @xmath89 is the canonical momentum .    one can check that substitution of the fourier transform of the wave function : @xmath90 to eq . ( 19 ) results in the integral equation ( 18 ) .",
    "note that eq.(19 ) which can be used to study the two - fermion systems such as the electron - proton system and particle - antiparticle system , has a significantly non - hamiltonian form .",
    "unlike hamiltonian equations , we can not , in the general case , separate the contributions of the potential and kinetic energies to the binding energy of the eigenstates .",

    "it was not essential for us here .",
    "we have shown that the use of the free two - fermion propagator which satisfies the lemann representation , gives rise to the new class of the electron - positron bound states .",
    "the second solution obtained is the unusually deep bound state with the anomalous small mass of the bound system .",
    "of course , this state can be affected by the electron vacuum polarization and spin interactions .",
    "similar considerations can be carried out for the proton - antiproton system .",
    "we believe that this deep bound state with the anomalous small mass can also arise for the system .",
