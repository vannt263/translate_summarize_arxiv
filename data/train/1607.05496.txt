    "the analytic calculation of the capacitance and potential coefficients of a couple of conductors of various definite shapes has a very long and distinguished history .",
    "several eminent scientists have tackled the issue@xcite , and many researchers have produced specialized studies in the past decades using more and more frequently the newly available numerical resources@xcite .",
    "due to availability of approximate solutions when the conductors are considered very far or very close from each other , much attention has been devoted to the asymptotic behavior of the parameters in the far and in the near limit as a suitable check of elaborate numerical procedures . moreover",
    ", even an approximate closed form is very useful in order to ascertain or conjecture on relevant and general properties of the electrostatic parameters .",
    "it is worth to note that the long history is punctuated by definite periods of revival of the issue , often in conjunction with particular field of technical application . in the 90s of the past century",
    "considerable effort was applied to the calculation of the capacitance of planar systems in conjunction with the analysis of microstrip transmission lines@xcite .",
    "today , the extensive use of mems devices such as electrostatically driven actuators or detectors sensitive to the static charge carried by movable parts ( e.g. capacitive    sensors ) urged an accurate knowledge of their electrical properties for selected geometries such as those occurring with parallel conducting plates or spherical - spherical and spherical - plane electrodes@xcite .",
    "the potential or capacitance coefficients are the primary parameters involved in the description of the charges ( voltages ) variations following a deformation of the shape of conductors or a change in their separation or in the dielectric constant of the gap material .",
    "those coefficients are also important in the investigation of the interelectrode forces arising when small charged conducting particles approach each other or one of them interacts with a close conducting surface@xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a generalization of the love s integral equation@xcite treating the case of disks of different diameters and giving the exact result in the near limit . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "these results are new .",
    "moreover , we put the specific problem explored in this paper in a more general framework : the analysis of divergences of the coefficients of capacitance when the mutual distance between conductors vanishes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ constraints ]",
    "we put the problem in the more general framework of small distances behavior of capacitance matrix elements . in section [ riassuntolove ]",
    "we give a brief review of the results for identical disks . in section [ sezdiscussione ]",
    "we present a summary of our results , particularly the expression of the capacity coefficients .",
    "we perform comparisons with large distances results and the arguments expressed in section [ constraints ] .",
    "section [ provaequazione ] provides a formal proof for the basic system of integral equations which fix the solution and in section [ risasintotici ] we perform the asymptotic small distance expansion , both for capacity and for solutions of the integral equations .",
    "let us consider a unique conductor , ideally composed by many approached parts , of capacitance @xmath1 which is the charge @xmath2 acquired if the body is maintained at unitary potential .",
    "the charge is equal to the flux of electric field across the surface of the body or , more intuitively , to the number of lines of force leaving the surface and ending at infinity .",
    "now let us perform a small displacement , @xmath3 , between two parts of the body : no force line joining the detached parts appears , if the potential of each part is held fixed , and the complex of lines acquires a small distortion . in more formal language the new total charge , @xmath4 is close to the original one , i.e. the total charge is a continuous function of @xmath3 . in particular , the charge @xmath2 is finite for @xmath5 , i.e. in the limit reproducing the original situation . using the same kind of reasoning",
    "one can conclude that the charge of each part remains finite in that limit .",
    "a more algebraic proof is obtained by observing that the sum of the individual charges @xmath6 gives the total charge @xmath4 and that @xmath6 is positive , being the sum of coefficients @xmath0 for fixed @xmath7 , see ref.@xcite ( 89 ) . then if @xmath4 is finite , the single @xmath6 can not diverge for @xmath8 .    in the particular case of a system of two conductors the above considerations amount to say    [ limitic ] @xmath9 = c_f < \\infty\\label{limitica}\\\\ & \\lim_{\\ell\\to 0}\\ , \\left[c_{11}(\\ell ) + \\ , c_{12}(\\ell)\\right ] < \\infty\\,;\\qquad \\lim_{\\ell\\to 0}\\ , \\left[c_{22}(\\ell ) + \\ , c_{12}(\\ell)\\right ] < \\infty\\,.\\label{limiticb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us stress that implies a complete cancellation between possible divergences in each conductor separately , while implies a limit value for a combination of the _ finite _ part of fringe effects .",
    "these constraints are particularly effective in the case of parallel plates , the limit of two plates being again a plate , and even more effective for identical parallel plates , where by symmetry _ 0= 12 c_f .[limitic2]while these considerations appear rather obvious , they provide a cogent check for both analytic and numeric computation of capacitance coefficients .",
    "the kind of divergences for @xmath8 depends on the type of contact . for point - like contacts as in the case of two spheres",
    "the divergence is logarithmic , and the relations can be easily checked on the exact solutions for this case , see eg.@xcite .",
    "the situation is particularly compelling in the case of two different flat conductors of area @xmath10 : we expect two divergent terms : a `` bulk '' divergence which goes like @xmath11 , and a `` fringe '' divergence growing like @xmath12 . on physical grounds , based on the force lines picture",
    ", one expects that the bulk divergence is ruled in general by the conductor of smaller area , while the logarithmic divergences must be essentially governed by the induction coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "the sum of the two terms must cancel out when @xmath13 is combined with two _ different _ self - capacitance coefficients , @xmath14 , in accordance with the constraints of eqs .. we have thought that it would be instructive to verify how this would be achieved in a system disregarded in the literature , and this has been the original motivation for the study of a capacitor composed by two different coaxial disks .",
    "the problem of a capacitor consisting of two parallel coaxial disks of radius @xmath15 and at distance @xmath3 has a long and rich history in the electrostatics research .",
    "the first classic result is the kirchhoff@xcite formula .",
    "a crucial step for our purposes has been done by e.r .",

    "we review some aspects of the problem to fix the notations and for comparison with subsequent work .",
    "we follow the clear presentation of these results given in ref.@xcite .    in short",
    "the solution of the general case of two equal disks at different potentials @xmath16 is reduced to a system of integral equations v_1 = f_1(t ) + _ 0 ^ 1 k(t , z ; ) f_2(z)dz ; v_2 = f_2(t ) + _ 0 ^ 1 k(t , z ; ) f_1(z)dz [ eqaccoppiateug1 ] where k(t , z ; ) = ( 1(z - t)^2 + ^2 + 1(z + t)^2 + ^2);= /a .
