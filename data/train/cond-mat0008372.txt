    "one very interesting property of field theories is that they can have critical points which are completely unseen in standard weak - coupling perturbation theory . to prove the existence of these fixed points requires using alternative perturbative methods ( such as the large-@xmath12 or large - spin expansion ) , or relying on non - perturbative methods .",
    "one of the remarkable features of two - dimensional field theories is that in some cases these non - trivial critical points can be understood non - perturbatively .",
    "a famous example arose in the study of integer and half - integer spin chains @xcite .",
    "the spin-@xmath13 heisenberg quantum spin chain is exactly solvable , and from bethe s exact solution it is known that the spectrum is gapless .",
    "the obvious guess for the field theory describing the spin chain in the continuum limit is the sphere sigma model .",
    "this sigma model is an @xmath14-symmetric field theory where the field takes values on a two - sphere .",
    "the two - sphere can be parametrized by three fields @xmath15 obeying the constraint @xmath16 .",
    "the euclidean action is @xmath17 this field theory , however , is not the correct continuum description of the spin chain , because it is also exactly solvable , and its spectrum is gapped @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that that when this sigma model is modified by adding an extra term called the theta term , the spectrum can become gapless @xcite .",
    "the theta term is inherently non - perturbative : it does not change the beta function derived near the trivial fixed point at all .",
    "nevertheless , the physics can be dramatically different from when @xmath7 @xcite . in two dimensions",
    ", this can result in a non - trivial fixed point .",
    "not only does the spectrum become gapless at the non - trivial critical point , but in addition , charge fractionalization occurs : the charges of the quasiparticles of the theory are fractions of the charge of the fields in the action .    to define the theta term ,",
    "field configurations are required to go to a constant at spatial infinity , so the spatial coordinates ( @xmath18 ) are effectively that of a sphere . since the field takes values on a sphere as well",
    ", the field is therefore a map from the sphere to a sphere .",
    "an important characteristic of such maps is that they can have non - trivial topology : they can not necessarily be continuously deformed to the identity map .",
    "this is analogous to what happens when a circle is mapped to a circle ( i.e.  a rubber band wrapped around a pole ) : you can do this an integer number of times called the winding number ( a negative winding number corresponds to flipping the rubber band upside down ) .",
    "it is the same thing for a sphere : a sphere can be wrapped around a sphere an integer number of times .",
    "an example of winding number 1 is the isomorphism from a point on the spatial sphere to the same point on the field sphere .",
    "the identity map has winding number 0 : it is the map from every point on the spatial sphere to a single point on the field sphere , e.g.  @xmath19 .",
    "field configurations with non - zero winding number are usually called instantons .",
    "the name comes from viewing one of the directions as time ( in our case , one would think of say @xmath20 as space and @xmath21 as euclidean time ) .",
    "since instanton configurations fall off to a constant at @xmath22 , the instanton describes a process local in time and hence `` instant '' .",
    "therefore , the field configurations in the sphere sigma model can be classified by an integer @xmath23 .",
    "this allows a term @xmath24 to be added to the action , where @xmath25 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "since @xmath23 is an integer , the physics is periodic under shifts of @xmath26 in @xmath25 .",
    "haldane argued that when @xmath0 , the sphere sigma model flows to a non - trivial critical point @xcite .    around the same time ,",
    "a similar proposal arose in some more general sigma models @xcite .",
    "these models are most easily formulated by having the field take values in the coset space @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are lie groups , with @xmath29 a subgroup of @xmath28 . in this language ,",
    "the two - sphere is equivalent to @xmath30 : while the vector @xmath15 can be rotated by the @xmath31 symmetry group , it is invariant under the @xmath32 subgroup consisting of rotations around its axis .",
    "thus the space of distinct three - dimensional fixed - length vectors ( the sphere ) is the coset @xmath30 . in order to describe two - dimensional non - interacting electrons with disorder and a strong transverse magnetic field ,",
    "one takes @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite . for @xmath35 ,",
    "one recovers the sphere sigma model .",
    "pruisken conjectured that in the replica limit @xmath36 , this sigma model has a critical point at @xmath0 .",
    "this critical point possibly describes the transitions between integer quantum hall plateaus .",
    "subsequently , a number of conjectures for non - trivial fixed points in sigma models have been made .",
    "for a survey of the applications of these conjectures to disordered systems , see @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize this result and prove that several infinite hierarchies of sigma models have non - trivial fixed points when @xmath0 .",
    "a useful tool is to study the spectrum and scattering matrix of the particles in an equivalent @xmath37-dimensional formulation .",
    "i will show that when these sigma models have @xmath7 , they are gapped , with the spectrum consisting of massive particles in the symmetric representation of @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively ( plus bound states in more general representations , and kinks with fractional charge in the latter case ) ) .",
    "when @xmath0 , the spectrum consists of gapless quasiparticles which are in the fundamental representations ( vector , antisymmetric tensor ,  ) of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( the latter including kinks in the spinor representation ) .",
    "the stable low - energy fixed points for the sphere sigma model and all the sigma models discussed in this paper are wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) models .",
    "the wzw model for a group @xmath29 is a sigma model where the field takes values in @xmath40 .",
    "it also has an extra term , called the wess - zumino term , which has an integer coefficient @xmath41 . in two dimensions , when @xmath42 , the model has a stable low - energy fixed point @xcite .",
    "the conformal field theory describing this fixed point is called the @xmath43 wzw model .",
    "one argument for the flow in the sphere sigma model at @xmath0 goes as follows @xcite .",
    "first one uses zamolodchikov s @xmath44-theorem , which makes precise the notion that as one follows renormalization group flows , the number of degrees of freedom goes down .",
    "zamolodchikov shows that there is a quantity @xmath44 associated with any two - dimensional unitary field theory such that @xmath44 must not increase along a flow . at a critical point",
    ", @xmath44 is the central charge of the corresponding conformal field theory @xcite . at the trivial fixed point of a sigma model where the manifold is flat",
    ", the central charge is the number of coordinates of the manifold . for the sphere",
    ", this means that @xmath45 at the trivial fixed point .",
    "this if the sphere sigma model flows to a non - trivial fixed point for @xmath0 , this fixed point must have @xmath46 symmetry and must have central charge less than @xmath47 .",
    "the only such unitary conformal field theories are @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "( the central charge of @xmath48 is @xmath50 ; in general , the central charge of @xmath43 is @xmath51dim(@xmath29)@xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the dual coxeter number of @xmath29 ) .",
    "one can use the techniques of @xcite to show that there are relevant operators at these fixed points , and at @xmath54 or @xmath55 , no symmetry of the sphere sigma model prevents these relevant operators from being added to the action @xcite .",
    "so while it is conceivable that the sphere sigma model with @xmath0 could flow near to these fixed points , these relevant operators would presumably appear in the action and cause a flow away .",
    "however , there is only one relevant operator ( or more precisely , a multiplet corresponding to the wzw field @xmath56 itself ) for the @xmath57 theory .",
    "the sigma model has a discrete symmetry @xmath58 when @xmath7 or @xmath8 ; the winding number @xmath23 goes to @xmath59 under this symmetry , but @xmath0 and @xmath60 are equivalent because of the periodicity in @xmath25 .",
    "this discrete symmetry of the sigma model turns into the symmetry @xmath61 of the wzw model .",
    "while the operator @xmath62 is @xmath14 invariant , it is not invariant under this discrete symmetry .",
    "therefore , this operator is forbidden from appearing in the effective action .",
    "the operator @xmath63 is irrelevant , so it is consistent for the sphere sigma model at @xmath0 to have the @xmath57 wzw model as its low - energy fixed point .",
    "a variety of arguments involving the spin chain strongly support this conjecture @xcite .",
    "an important question is therefore whether the existence of these non - perturbative fixed points in sigma models at @xmath0 can be established definitively .",
    "the fact that the sphere sigma model has a non - trivial fixed point at @xmath0 was proven in @xcite .",
    "this proof does not involve the spin-@xmath13 chain which motivated the result . rather , it is a statement about the non - trivial fixed point in the sphere sigma model at @xmath0 .",
    "this proof utilizes the integrability of the sphere sigma model at @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "integrability means that there are an infinite number of conserved currents which allow one to find exactly the spectrum of quasiparticles and their scattering matrix in the corresponding @xmath37 dimensional field theory .",
    "the quasiparticles for @xmath7 are gapped and form a triplet under the @xmath14 symmetry , while for @xmath0 they are gapless , and form @xmath14 doublets ( left- and right - moving ) @xcite .",
    "this is a beautiful example of charge fractionalization : the fields @xmath15 form a triplet under the @xmath14 symmetry , but when @xmath0 the excitations of the system are doublets . to prove that this is the correct particle spectrum",
    ", first one computes a scattering matrix for these particles which is consistent with all the symmetries of the theory . from the exact @xmath6 matrix",
    ", the @xmath44 function can be computed .",
    "it was found that at high energy @xmath44 indeed is @xmath47 as it should be at the trivial fixed point , while @xmath64 as it should be at the @xmath57 low - energy fixed point @xcite . as an even more detailed check ,",
    "the free energy at zero temperature in the presence of a magnetic field was computed for both @xmath7 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the results can be expanded in a series around the trivial fixed point .",
    "one can identify the ordinary perturbative contributions to this series , and finds that they are the same for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , even though the particles and @xmath6 matrices are completely different @xcite .",
    "this is as it must be : instantons and the @xmath25 term are a boundary effect and hence can not be seen in ordinary perturbation theory .",
    "one can also identify the non - perturbative contributions to these series , and see that they differ . far away from the trivial fixed point ,",
    "non - perturbative contributions can dominate which allow a non - trivial fixed point to appear when @xmath0 even though there is none at @xmath7 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize these computations to the @xmath1 and @xmath65 sigma models . to have any hope of being able to take the replica limit @xmath36",
    ", one needs a solution for any @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath1 sigma model reduces to the sphere sigma model when @xmath66 , while @xmath67 reduces to two copies of the sphere when @xmath68 .",
    "thus these sigma models are the generalizations of the sphere sigma model with @xmath38 and @xmath39 symmetry respectively .",
    "one difference , however , is that in general they do not allow a continuous @xmath25 parameter , but instead @xmath25 can only be zero or @xmath8 .",
    "i will show that when @xmath0 , the @xmath1 and @xmath69 sigma models have stable low - energy fixed points .",
    "the corresponding conformal field theories are the @xmath2 and @xmath70 wzw models , respectively .    in section 2",
    "i define the sigma models . in section 3 ,",
    "i review @xmath6 matrices in an integrable model with a global symmetry @xmath28 . in section 4 ,",
    "i discuss the gross - neveu model .",
    "this is not a sigma model , but is closely related .",
    "these results are crucial in what follows . in section 5",
    ", i will find the particles and their scattering matrices for the sigma models . in section 6",
    ", i will do a substantial check on this picture by using the exact @xmath6 matrix to compute the energy in the presence of a background field .",
    "in particular , i check that the perturbative contributions to this energy are in agreement with conventional perturbation theory , and that the expansions for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the same ( but the non - perturbative contributions differ ) . in section 7 , i discuss the low - energy fixed points at @xmath0 , and flows between them . i also present a conjecture for the low - energy behavior of the @xmath10 sigma model .",
    "this last section is written to be reasonably self - contained , so readers interested in the results but not the details ( and willing to trust me ) can skip sections 3 - 6 .",
    "the sigma models discussed in this paper all can be written conveniently in terms of an matrix field @xmath71 with action @xmath72 along with the constraints @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the identity matrix .",
    "in other words , @xmath71 is always a unitary matrix with determinant @xmath75 , with possibly additional constraints . the constraints ( [ restriction ] ) can easily be obtained from theories without constraints by adding a potentials like @xmath76 . when @xmath77 gets large , one recovers the restrictions ( [ restriction ] ) . in theories with interacting fermions , this often results from introducing a bosonic field to replace four - fermion interaction terms with yukawa terms ( interactions between a boson and two fermions ) . integrating out the fermions then results in such potentials and hence the sigma model .",
    "the sigma models discussed in this paper are obtained by putting additional restrictions of the matrix field @xmath71 .",
    "the two series of models studied both require that @xmath71 be symmetric as well as unitary , so the matrices do not form a group : multiplying symmetric matrices does not necessarily give a symmetric matrix . instead , these spaces is of @xmath27 form .",
    "the @xmath1 sigma model is obtained by requiring that @xmath71 be a symmetric @xmath78 unitary matrix with determinant @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath65 sigma model is obtained by requiring that @xmath71 be a real , symmetric , orthogonal and traceless @xmath80 matrix .",
    "in general , in two dimensions a @xmath27 sigma model has a global symmetry @xmath28 . the action ( [ action ] ) and restriction ( [ restriction ] ) are invariant under the symmetry @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a unitary matrix with determinant one .",
    "this is the most general symmetry which keeps @xmath71 symmetric and unitary . in the @xmath65 sigma models ,",
    "@xmath82 must be real as well , so @xmath83 .",
    "the field @xmath71 in this case can diagonalized with an orthogonal matrix @xmath82 , so @xmath84 where @xmath82 is in @xmath39 , and @xmath85 is the matrix with @xmath86 values @xmath87 and @xmath86 values @xmath88 on the diagonal .",
    "different @xmath82 can result in the same @xmath71 : the subgroup leaving @xmath71 invariant is @xmath89 .",
    "similarly , field configurations in the @xmath1 sigma model can be written in the form @xmath90 where @xmath82 is in @xmath38 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath29 leaving @xmath71 invariant is @xmath91 .",
    "for example , @xmath92 for any real @xmath82 in @xmath38 , i.e.  if @xmath82 is in the real subgroup @xmath91 of @xmath38 .",
    "this is why @xmath93 here .",
    "these spaces @xmath27 studied here are examples of symmetric spaces . a symmetric space",
    "@xmath27 has @xmath29 a maximal subgroup of @xmath28 ( no subgroup other than @xmath28 itself contains @xmath29 ) .",
    "the important property of a sigma model on a symmetric space is that it contains only one coupling constant @xmath94 in the action . in other words , the space @xmath27 preserves its `` shape '' under renormalization , with only the overall volume changing .",
    "the one and two - loop beta functions for all two - dimensional sigma models are universal and can be expressed in terms of the curvature of the field manifold @xcite .",
    "the effect of renormalization is to increase the curvature ( increase @xmath94 ) . even though naively there is no mass scale in the theory ( @xmath94 is dimensionless ) , physical quantities depend on a scale ( e.g. a lattice length or a momentum cutoff ) as a result of short - distance effects .",
    "the renormalized coupling depends on this scale . at short distances",
    ", @xmath94 is small , so the theory is effectively free : it is a theory of dim@xmath95dim@xmath29 free fields . at longer distances",
    "the theory is interacting : the dim@xmath95dim@xmath29 fields interact because of the constraint ( [ restriction ] ) . in renormalization - group language",
    ", there is an unstable trivial fixed point at @xmath96 , and no non - trivial low - energy fixed point unless one includes a theta or wzw term .",
    "both sets of sigma models allow a theta term to be added to the action .",
    "this is a result long ago proven by mathematicians ( for a discussion accessible to physicists , see @xcite ) . in mathematical language",
    ", the question is whether the second homotopy group @xmath97 is non - trivial .",
    "the second homotopy group is just the group of winding numbers of maps from the sphere to @xmath27 , so for the sphere it is the integers .",
    "the general answer is that @xmath97 is the kernel of the embedding of @xmath98 into @xmath99 , where @xmath98 is the group of winding numbers for maps of the circle into @xmath29 .",
    "the rubber band on a pole example means that @xmath98 is the integers when @xmath29 is the circle @xmath100 .",
    "the only simple lie group @xmath29 for which @xmath101 is nonzero is @xmath91 , where @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath12=2 .",
    "thus there are models with integer winding number , some with just winding number @xmath105 or @xmath79 , and some with no instantons at all .",
    "integer winding number means that @xmath25 is continuous and periodic , while a winding number of @xmath105 or @xmath79 means that @xmath25 is just @xmath105 or @xmath8 ( just think of @xmath25 as being the fourier partner of @xmath23 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath69 sigma models therefore have instantons with @xmath106 winding number , and so @xmath25 can be zero or @xmath8 .",
    "even though the sigma models are originally defined in two - dimensional euclidean space ( @xmath18 ) , it is very convenient to continue to real time @xmath107 . the reason is to treat the field theory as a @xmath37 dimensional particle theory .",
    "a fundamental property of many field theories is that all states of the theory can be written in terms of particles . in other words ,",
    "the space of states is combination of one - particle states , usually called a fock space .",
    "if the theory has a stable non - trivial fixed point at low energy , then the particles should be massless : the energy is linearly related to the momentum : @xmath108 .",
    "if there is no fixed point , then the particles are massive : @xmath109 in a lorentz - invariant theory . in condensed - matter physics ,",
    "the particles are often called `` quasiparticles '' , to emphasize the fact that the particles may not be the same as the underlying degrees of freedom : just because a system is made up of electrons does not mean that the collective excitations are electrons , or even resemble them .",
    "this phenomenon will occur frequently in this paper .",
    "one finds the scattering matrix of an integrable model by utilizing a variety of constraints : unitarity , crossing symmetry , global symmetries , the consistency of bound states , and the factorization ( yang - baxter ) equations .",
    "it is convenient to write the momentum and energy of a particle in terms of its rapidity @xmath25 , defined by @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "lorentz invariance requires that the two - particle @xmath6 matrix depends only on the rapidity difference @xmath112 of the two particles .",
    "the invariance of the @xmath27 sigma model under the lie - group symmetry @xmath28 requires that the @xmath6 matrices commute with all group elements .",
    "the @xmath6 matrix can then be conveniently written in terms of projection operators . a projection operator @xmath113 maps the tensor product of two representations onto an irreducible representation labelled by @xmath41 .",
    "by definition , these operators satisfy @xmath114 . requiring invariance under @xmath28",
    "means that the @xmath6 matrix for a particle in the representation @xmath115 with one in a representation @xmath116 means that the @xmath6 matrix is of the form @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the difference of the rapidities , and the @xmath119 are as of yet unknown functions .",
    "the sum on the right - hand side is over all representations @xmath41 which appear in the tensor product of @xmath115 and @xmath116 ; of course @xmath120 . in an integrable theory ,",
    "the functions @xmath121 are determined up to an overall function by requiring that they satisfy the yang - baxter equation .",
    "this stems from the requirement that the @xmath6-matrix be factorizable : the multiparticle scattering amplitudes factorize into a product of two - particle ones .",
    "there are two possible ways of factorizing the three - particle amplitude into two - particle ones ; the requirement that they give the same answer is the yang - baxter equation .",
    "there have been hundreds of papers discussing how to solve this equation , so i will not review this here . for",
    "a detailed discussion relevant to the sigma models here , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "solutions arising in the sigma models will be given below .    to obtain the overall function not given by the yang - baxter equation",
    ", one needs to require that the @xmath6 matrix be unitary , and that it obey crossing symmetry . with the standard assumption that the amplitude is real for @xmath25 imaginary",
    ", the unitarity relation @xmath122 implies @xmath123 .",
    "the latter is more useful because it is a functional relation which can be continued throughout the complex @xmath25 plane .",
    "crossing symmetry is familiar from field theory , where rotating feynman diagrams by @xmath124 relates scattering of particles @xmath125 and @xmath126 to the scattering of the antiparticle @xmath127 with @xmath126 . in @xmath6 matrix form",
    ", it says that @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the charge - conjugation operator acting on the states in representation @xmath115 .    multiplying any @xmath6 matrix by function @xmath130 which satisfies @xmath131 and",
    "@xmath132 will give an @xmath6 matrix still obeying the yang - baxter equation , crossing and unitarity ( this is called the cdd ambiguity ) . to determine @xmath130 uniquely",
    ", one ultimately needs to verify that the @xmath6 matrix gives the correct results for the free energy .",
    "how to do this will be described in the following sections . before doing this calculation",
    ", one must make sure an additional criterion holds : the poles of the @xmath6 matrix are consistent with the bound - state spectrum of the theory .",
    "the @xmath6 matrices of bound states are related to those of the constituents by the bootstrap relation , which can be formulated as follows @xcite .",
    "poles of @xmath133 matrix elements at some value @xmath134 with @xmath135 imaginary and in the `` physical strip '' @xmath136 are usually associated with bound states .",
    "each of the functions @xmath121 has a residue at this pole @xmath137 . then there are bound states in representation @xmath41 if @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the parity of states in representation @xmath41 @xcite ( poles which do not correspond to bound states give bound states in the process obtained by crossing ) .",
    "these bound states @xmath140 have mass @xmath141 the bound states are not in a irreducible representation of @xmath28 if more than one of the residues @xmath137 is non - zero .",
    "then the @xmath6 matrix for scattering the bound state @xmath140 from another particle @xmath44 is given by @xmath142 where the projection operators @xmath113 act on the states in representations @xmath143 .",
    "note that the matrices in ( [ bootstrap ] ) are not all acting on the same spaces , so this relation is to be understood as multiplying the appropriate elements ( not matrix multiplication ) .",
    "all of the above considerations apply to massless particles as well , with a few modifications and generalizations @xcite .",
    "the theories being studied are along a flow into their stable low - energy fixed point .",
    "even though the quasiparticles are gapless , there is still a mass scale @xmath144 describing the crossover : @xmath145 is the unstable high - energy fixed point , while @xmath146 is the stable low - energy one .",
    "the rapidity variable for a massless particle is then defined via @xmath147 , @xmath148 for right movers and @xmath149 , @xmath150 for left movers , where @xmath151 is not really the mass of the particle but is proportional to @xmath144 ( different particles can and do have different values of @xmath151 ) .",
    "the @xmath6 matrix still depends only on rapidity differences .",
    "note in particular that the @xmath6 matrices for two left movers @xmath152 or two right movers @xmath153 depend on the ratio @xmath154 of the two particles , and so do not depend on the mass scale @xmath144 at all .",
    "these are determined solely by properties of the low - energy fixed point .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath155 depends on the physics of how one flows into this fixed point .",
    "massless particles still can have bound states like massive ones .",
    "these bound states show up as poles in @xmath152 and @xmath153 , but it does not seem possible to have poles in @xmath155 in the physical strip @xcite .",
    "before discussing the particle content of the sigma models , it is useful to first discuss the gross - neveu models .",
    "these are not sigma models , but are closely related : they are asymptotically - free field theories with a global symmetry @xmath28 . for groups",
    "@xmath156 and @xmath157 they were originally formulated in terms of fermions with a four - fermion interaction . for @xmath156 ,",
    "the action was first written in terms of @xmath12 majorana ( real ) fermions with a four - fermion interaction : @xcite @xmath158 for @xmath38 the action can also be written in terms of fermions ( this is sometimes known as the chiral gross - neveu model @xcite ) , but for general @xmath28 the gross - neveu models are most easily defined in terms of the @xmath28 wess - zumino - witten model at level @xmath79 . the wzw model has a local symmetry @xmath159 generated by chiral currents @xmath160 and @xmath161 ( the explicit definitions are given in section 7 below ) . the action of the @xmath28 gross - neveu model is then a perturbation of the @xmath162 wzw action : @xmath163 the coupling @xmath94 is naively dimensionless , but it has lowest - order beta function @xmath164 where the constant of proportionality is negative .",
    "this means that for positive @xmath94 the coupling is marginally relevant @xcite . in other words , the wzw fixed point in ( [ gnaction ] )",
    "is unstable and ( [ ongn ] ) defines a massive field theory called the gross - neveu model . for negative @xmath94 ,",
    "the coupling is marginally irrelevant and the wzw fixed point is stable , a fact which will become important for sigma models with @xmath0 .",
    "as one would expect , there are particles in the @xmath156 gross - neveu model with the same quantum numbers as the fermions in ( [ ongn ] ) .",
    "these are in the defining ( @xmath12-dimensional vector ) representation of @xmath156 . for general @xmath28 ,",
    "this is also true : there are particles in the defining representation of @xmath28",
    ". however , there is more . for @xmath156",
    ", there are kinks as well , as follows from a semi - classical analysis of the action ( [ ongn ] ) .",
    "these particles are in the spinor representations of @xmath156 @xcite .",

    "the fundamental representations of @xmath38 have young tableau with only one column : the defining ( @xmath12-dimensional ) representation , the two - index antisymmetric tensor , all the way through the @xmath170 representation .",

    "the simplest solution for the overall function consistent with crossing symmetry and unitarity for particles in the vector representation of @xmath38 is @xmath181 , where @xmath182 this is called the minimal solution , because the resulting @xmath6 matrix has no poles in the physical strip : a zero in ( [ vv4 ] ) cancels the pole in ( [ vv3 ] ) .",

    "the @xmath6 matrices for the @xmath156 gross neveu model are derived in the same manner as those with @xmath38 symmetry , but there are a number of additional complications .",
    "the scattering of particles both in the vector representation of @xmath156 is of the form @xmath205 where the projection operators on the symmetric ( @xmath6 ) , antisymmetric ( @xmath175 ) and singlet ( @xmath105 ) representations are explicitly @xmath206 where i have suppressed the @xmath25 dependence .",
    "for example , the scattering process @xmath207 has @xmath6 matrix element @xmath208 , while the process @xmath209 has element @xmath210 .",

    "the @xmath6 matrix does not contain any poles because the @xmath216 model has no particles in any representations other than the vector , and hence no bound states .",
    "the @xmath156 gross - neveu model has bound states . just like in @xmath38 , there are particles in all the antisymmetric representations , whose @xmath6 matrices follow from the bootstrap .",
    "these representations are self - conjugate : there is no @xmath217 representation .",
    "that means that both the bound - state ( @xmath218-channel ) pole at @xmath187 and the crossed pole ( @xmath219-channel ) channel at @xmath220 appear in @xmath221 , yielding @xmath222 where @xmath184 is as in ( [ vvpole ] ) with @xmath190 , with the dual coxeter number here @xmath223 .",
    "this value of @xmath180 ensures the bootstrap closes .",
    "the particles obtained by fusing the vector particle @xmath172 times therefore have mass @xmath224 .",
    "one difference between the @xmath156 and @xmath38 gross - neveu models is apparent in ( [ ovvgn ] ) : if there is a pole in the antisymmetric channel at @xmath187 , there is also one in the singlet channel .",
    "this means that there are extra bound states in the @xmath156 gross - neveu model .",
    "for example , there are @xmath225 particles with mass @xmath226 : @xmath227 of them transform in the two - index antisymmetric representation of @xmath156 , while one is a singlet under @xmath156 . in general , at mass @xmath228 there are particles in all the @xmath41-index completely antisymmetric representations @xmath229 for even @xmath172 and @xmath230 for odd @xmath172 @xcite . despite this additional complication , one can in principle obtain the @xmath6 matrices for all of these states by using fusion .",
    "this was done explicitly for @xmath54 in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 matrix for the kinks in the spinor representation in the @xmath156 gross - neveu model is given in @xcite .",
    "it can be written out explicitly , but since the answer is somewhat complicated i will not give it here .",
    "it is derived by using the fact that kink - kink bound states contain the particles in the antisymmetric representations as bound states ; in fact is a sort of reverse bootstrap .",
    "the mass of the spinor states is given by @xmath231 .",
    "in general , the particles of the @xmath28 gross - neveu theory are in fundamental representations of @xmath28 .",
    "their masses and multiplicities are known from considering the bound - state properties of the exact @xmath6 matrix .",
    "in this section i give the particle content and exact scattering matrices of the @xmath1 and @xmath65 sigma models . in the next section",
    ", i will use the exact @xmath6 matrix to compute the energy in a background field .",
    "the representations of the global symmetries of sigma models are somewhat more elaborate than that in the gross - neveu model .",
    "the results are different for each model , and also change dramatically if certain extra terms are added to the action ( [ action ] ) .      for @xmath1 , the action is written in terms of a symmetric unitary matrix field @xmath71 .",
    "thus as opposed to the gross - neveu model , one expects there to be particles forming the symmetric representation of @xmath38 , which has dimension @xmath232 .",
    "indeed , it was long ago established that for @xmath66 ( the sphere sigma model ) , the particles are in the symmetric ( triplet ) representation of @xmath14 @xcite . for any @xmath12",
    ", there are non - trivial non - local conserved currents in this sigma model @xcite .",
    "these conserved currents are consistent with particles in the symmetric representation , and also with bound states in all representations of @xmath38 with young tableau with two columns and rectangular ( i.e.  the same number of boxes in each of the columns ) . in group - theory language , these are representations with highest weight @xmath233 ( the fundamental representations arising in the gross - neveu model have highest weight @xmath234 ) .    building the bound - state @xmath6 matrices with the bootstrap relation ( [ bootstrap ] ) is one example of a general procedure called fusion @xcite .",
    "fusion exploits the fact that the @xmath6 matrix can be written as the sum of projection operators to find new solutions of the yang - baxter equation .",
    "it is useful for things other than just the bound states in a given theory .",
    "the solution of the yang - baxter equation @xmath235 for particles are in the symmetric representation can also be obtained from @xmath199",
    ". the solution is obtained from ( [ bootstrap ] ) like before , using instead the pole at @xmath236 .",
    "the tensor product of two symmetric representations contains three representations with young tableaux @xmath237 it is convenient to label particles in the symmetric representation with two indices and the constraint @xmath238 .",
    "the projection operators are then explicitly @xmath239 this means , for example , that the @xmath6 matrix element for scattering an initial state of @xmath240 and @xmath241 to a final state of @xmath240 and @xmath241 is @xmath242 , while the element for scattering the same two particles and getting @xmath243 and @xmath244 in the final state is @xmath245 .",
    "this enables us to find the @xmath6 matrix for the particles in the @xmath1 sigma model at @xmath7 in the symmetric representation : @xmath246 where @xmath184 is the same as in the gross - neveu model .",
    "the overall function @xmath247 is determined by using unitarity , crossing and the bootstrap .",
    "the result is that @xmath248 the symmetric representation has highest weight @xmath249 .",
    "the pole in the @xmath6 matrix at @xmath250 results in a bound state transforming in the representation with highest weight @xmath251 , with mass @xmath252 .",
    "in fact , the factor @xmath253 ensures that the spectrum of bound states is just like that in the @xmath38 gross - neveu model .",
    "building the @xmath6 matrices for the bound states in the @xmath1 sigma model proceeds just like the @xmath38 gross - neveu model .",
    "for example , the prefactor in ( [ sssym ] ) ensures that @xmath254 determined by the bootstrap is the same as that following from crossing . to close the bootstrap , @xmath190 as before , with @xmath255 for @xmath38 .",
    "there are particles in all representations with highest weight @xmath256 .",
    "each representation appears just once with mass is @xmath257 . for @xmath66 ,",
    "this model reduces to the @xmath30 model ( [ o3 ] ) , and the @xmath6 matrix ( [ sssym ] ) becomes that of a massive @xmath31 triplet , familiar from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 sigma model with no @xmath25 term is therefore an integrable generalization of the sphere sigma model to all @xmath38 .",
    "i will now show that the behavior at @xmath0 also generalizes .    to find the particles and scattering matrices when @xmath0",
    ", it is first necessary to understand the non - trivial fixed point .",
    "generalizing from @xmath12=2 , it is natural to assume that it is @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , the argument from @xcite can be adapted to show that this is completely consistent with the symmetries of the problem .",
    "to apply the consistency argument here , it is first useful to study the symmetries of the @xmath38 gross - neveu model .",
    "to avoid confusion with the sigma model , i denote the field in the gross - neveu model as @xmath56 . with the definition ( [ gnaction ] ) as a perturbed wzw model",
    ", @xmath56 must be an @xmath38 matrix .",
    "therefore , it transforms under the @xmath38 symmetry as @xmath258 , where @xmath82 is an element of @xmath38 .",
    "the currents also transform as @xmath259 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath172 are in the adjoint representation of @xmath38 .",
    "the action ( [ gnaction ] ) is manifestly symmetric under the symmetry @xmath260 .",
    "the @xmath261 is the center of @xmath38 , consisting of of matrices @xmath262 , where @xmath263 is a @xmath12th root of unity , and @xmath74 is the identity matrix .",
    "the matrices @xmath262 commute with all elements of @xmath38 .",
    "the reason this discrete subgroup is divided out is that if @xmath264 , @xmath56 and @xmath172 are left invariant .",
    "thus the symmetry acting manifestly on the action is @xmath260 , not @xmath38 .",
    "however , the full symmetry of the gross - neveu model is larger .",
    "this can be seen in several ways .",
    "first of all , note that there are particles in the model in the vector representation .",
    "the full @xmath38 group acts on the vector representation non - trivially .",
    "indeed , one can assign an extra @xmath261 charge to the particles of the model , defined so that the particles in the @xmath172-index antisymmetric representation have charge @xmath265 .",
    "another way of seeing this extra charge is by examining terms which do _ not _ appear in the action ( [ gnaction ] ) .",
    "the @xmath260-symmetric operators in the @xmath2 conformal field theory are @xmath266 , where @xmath173 .",
    "some of these are relevant operators , and if added to the action would change the physics considerably . however",
    ", they are forbidden from the action if the model is required to be invariant under the symmetry @xmath267 .",
    "this discrete symmetry is not part of the @xmath38 acting on the @xmath56 field , but rather makes the full symmetry of the model @xmath268 .",
    "this symmetry of the action and the full @xmath38 of the particle description are completely consistent with each other if the particles are kinks in the @xmath56 field .",
    "( they are kinks in the @xmath37-dimensional picture , vortices in the @xmath269-dimensional picture . )",
    "the presence of kinks is easy to see .",
    "the field values @xmath270 and @xmath271 are not related by a continuous symmetry , so field configurations with @xmath272 and @xmath273 are topologically stable .",
    "these are the kinks .",
    "the extra @xmath261 symmetry is then indeed the discrete kink charge",
    ". this sort of symmetry should be familiar from the sine - gordon model , where the soliton charge is not an explicit symmetry of the action .",
    "the symmetries of the @xmath1 sigma model at @xmath0 are similar to those in the gross - neveu model .",
    "the @xmath261 center acts non - trivially on the @xmath1 matrix @xmath71 , as seen in ( [ symmetry ] ) .",
    "thus the symmetry of the sigma model action is the full @xmath38 ( or to be precise , for even @xmath12 it is @xmath274 ) .",
    "therefore it is consistent for the low - energy fixed point of the @xmath1 sigma model to be @xmath2 .",
    "the reason is the same as in the @xmath38 gross - neveu model : the full @xmath38 symmetry of the action in terms of @xmath71 implies a @xmath268 symmetry of the low - energy effective action involving @xmath56 .",
    "this forbids the relevant operators from being added to the @xmath2 action .",
    "this argument shows that the effective action near the low - energy fixed point contains only @xmath38-invariant irrelevant operators .",
    "the operator @xmath275 is @xmath38 invariant and of dimension @xmath47 .",
    "thus the effective action here is like the gross - neveu action ( [ gnaction ] ) , except here the coupling @xmath94 is negative so that the perturbing operator is irrelevant .",
    "the coupling @xmath94 is related to the scale @xmath144 ; when @xmath276 , @xmath277 from below , and the model reaches the low - energy fixed point .",
    "the form of the effective action near the low - energy fixed point gives the @xmath6 matrices @xmath152 and @xmath153 immediately , because as explained above they are independent of @xmath144 and therefore follow solely from @xmath2 .",
    "they must be in fact those of the massless limit of the gross - neveu model .",
    "written as functions of rapidity they are @xmath278 thus the spectrum of these gapless particles is the same as that of the massive particles of the gross - neveu model : there are particles in any antisymmetric representation , a left - moving and right - moving set for each representation .",
    "even though the particles here are gapless , the mass ratios of the gross - neveu model still appear in the definition of rapidity .",
    "for example , a right mover in the representation @xmath234 has energy @xmath279 .",
    "the charge has fractionalized , as compared to @xmath7 .    for @xmath12=2 ,",
    "the @xmath6 matrix @xmath280 as a function of rapidity is the same as @xmath281 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath6 matrix satisfies the yang - baxter equation , and has the appropriate @xmath14 ( not @xmath282 ) symmetry .",
    "however , the situation is not quite as simple for general @xmath12 , because there are poles in @xmath152 and @xmath153 in the physical strip , resulting in the bound states .",
    "these poles are forbidden in @xmath155 .",
    "however , it is easy to remove these and still have a sensible @xmath6 matrix .",
    "the bound - state @xmath6 matrices @xmath283 are labeled with @xmath284 corresponding to the antisymmetric representations with @xmath115 and @xmath116 indices .",
    "for example @xmath285 and @xmath286 . the unwanted poles in @xmath133 all arise from the factor @xmath287 and its fusions .",
    "the matrix @xmath288 contains the overall function @xmath289\\pi i \\delta\\right ) .",
    "\\label{xab}\\ ] ] for example , @xmath290 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath291 contains all the poles in the physical strip in @xmath288 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath292 and that @xmath293 .",
    "therefore @xmath294 satisfies crossing , unitarity , the yang - baxter equation , and has no poles in the physical strip .",
    "thus this is the @xmath6 matrix for left - right scattering in the @xmath1 sigma model at @xmath0 . for @xmath66 , @xmath295 , and",
    "the result reduces to that in @xcite .    to prove that this picture is correct , in the next section",
    "i will show that these @xmath6 matrices give a model which is @xmath2 in the low - energy limit , but is the @xmath1 sigma model at high energy .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the corresponding @xmath44 function is calculated , and indeed flows from the @xmath296 ( the value at the trivial high - energy fixed point in @xmath1 to @xmath297 ( the central charge for @xmath2 ) .",
    "as with the gross - neveu models , the @xmath65 sigma model is a slightly more complicated version of its @xmath38 analog , the @xmath1 sigma model .",
    "the field @xmath71 is symmetric and unitary ( and also real and traceless ) , so again one expects particles in the symmetric representation of @xmath39 ( which is @xmath298 dimensional ) , and its various bound states .",
    "this is what happens for @xmath68 , where the model reduces to two copies of the sphere sigma model : there are six particles : three in each of the symmetric representations . here , for @xmath299 , the non - local conserved currents have not been found , although some interesting results for the local currents in the classical model ( @xmath94 small ) have been found @xcite .    the @xmath6 matrices for the @xmath65 model can be constructed by fusing the @xmath39 gross - neveu results .",
    "the @xmath6 matrix for particles in the symmetric representation of @xmath39 ( highest weight @xmath249 ) is of the form @xcite @xmath300 where @xmath190 as always , with @xmath301 here .",
    "the minimal solution ( no poles in the physical strip ) for the prefactor is @xmath302 like the @xmath39 gross - neveu model , to get bound states there must be poles at @xmath250 and @xmath303 .",
    "this means that the prefactor of @xmath304 is @xmath305 because the factor @xmath306 is the same , the bootstrap for the @xmath65 model gives bound states with the same spectrum as the @xmath39 gross - neveu model .",
    "also like the @xmath39 gross - neveu model , there are particles which do not follow obviously from the action .",
    "these are in `` double - spinor '' representations , formed by the symmetric product of two spinor representations . in group theory language",
    "they have highest weight @xmath307 , where @xmath308 is the highest - weight of a spinor representation ; they are @xmath309 dimensional .",
    "these particles presumably are kinks like in the gross - neveu model , but it is not clear how to extract this information directly from the action .",
    "the @xmath6 matrix for these kinks is quite complicated , since many representations appear in the tensor product of two double - spinor representations .",
    "it can presumably be obtained by fusion of the spinor @xmath6 matrices , or by the reverse bootstrap like the gross - neveu kinks .",
    "the presence of these particles is confirmed by studying the free energy at non - zero temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , in both series of sigma models there are particles in all representations with highest weight @xmath310 .",
    "however , here there are even more degeneracies and more representations appearing . since there is a pole in ( [ oss ] ) at @xmath187 , then there must be bound states not only in the representation with highest weight @xmath251 , but also in the singlet and in the antisymmetric representation ( highest weight @xmath311 ) .",
    "thus charge is fractionalized even at @xmath7 .",
    "for example , in @xmath312 , the vector and spinor representations are @xmath313-dimensional , the antisymmetric representation has dimension @xmath314 , the symmetric and double - spinors dimension @xmath315 , and the representation with highest weight @xmath251 has dimension @xmath316 .",
    "thus in the @xmath312 gross - neveu model , there are @xmath313 particles in the vector ( mass @xmath317 ) @xmath313 particles in each of the spinor representations ( mass @xmath144 ) , and @xmath318 particles of mass @xmath319 .",
    "thus there are @xmath320 stable particles in the @xmath312 gross - neveu model . in the @xmath321 sigma model , there are @xmath315 particles in each of the vector and two double - spinor representations , all of mass @xmath144",
    ". there are @xmath322 particles of mass @xmath323 , giving @xmath324 particles in all .",
    "the behavior when @xmath0 in the @xmath65 model is also reminiscent of the @xmath1 model at @xmath0 .",
    "the arguments follow in the same fashion .",
    "the model has the @xmath70 wzw model as a stable low - energy fixed point .",
    "the @xmath70 wzw model is equivalent to @xmath325 free majorana fermions , or equivalently @xmath325 decoupled ising models .",
    "the word `` free '' is slightly deceptive , because just as in a single 2d ising model , one can study correlators of the magnetization or `` twist '' operator , which are highly non - trivial .",
    "the consistency argument is simpler here : the only relevant @xmath39 symmetric operators are the fermion mass and the magnetization operator ; neither is invariant under the symmetry @xmath326 of the sigma model .",
    "the @xmath44-function is computed in @xcite , and indeed flows from @xmath327 to @xmath328 as it must .",
    "the @xmath6 matrix for the quasiparticles follows from the gross - neveu model .",
    "the same arguments applied above to the @xmath1 sigma model at @xmath0 show here that the massless left- and right - moving particles have the same spectrum as the @xmath39 gross - neveu model .",
    "charges fractionalize : the left- and right - moving particles are in the fundamental representations of @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath6 matrices for the particles in antisymmetric representations are @xmath329 for particles in the spinor representations , the poles can easily be removed as well ; see @xcite for the definition of @xmath291 for the spinor representations . even though the field theory at the low - energy fixed point is free fermions , the @xmath6 matrix is factorizable away from the fixed point only in the basis related to the gross - neveu model .",
    "in this section i compute the energy of these sigma models at zero temperature in a background magnetic field .",
    "this is very useful for several reasons .",
    "first of all , it allows a direct comparison of the @xmath6 matrix to perturbative results .",
    "this in particular ensures that the @xmath6 matrices are correct as written in the last section .",
    "for example , it eliminates the possibility of extra cdd factors and/or extra bound states .",
    "second , because the effect of a @xmath25 term is non - perturbative , the perturbative expansions for the sigma models at @xmath7 and @xmath8 must be the same .",
    "thus even though the @xmath6 matrices for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are very different , the energy must have the same perturbative expansion .",
    "i verify that this is true for the above @xmath6 matrices .",

    "for these to commute with @xmath575 @xmath567 and @xmath568 , @xmath574 and @xmath517 must satisfy @xmath576=0\\qquad \\qquad \\{d , z\\}=0\\ ] ] the subalgebra consisting of all matrices @xmath574 and @xmath517 obeying these constraints is precisely @xmath9 : by exponentiating @xmath574 and @xmath517 into some matrix @xmath577 , one finds @xmath578 , which is the defining relation of the group @xmath9 .",
    "note that because @xmath574 is real , @xmath86 is not necessarily unitary .",
    "a unitary matrix can be obtained by exponentiating @xmath579 and @xmath517 , giving the embedding of @xmath9 in @xmath580 .",
    "therefore , in the embedding ( [ embed2 ] ) , the currents @xmath581 ( @xmath582 or @xmath583 ) form the @xmath584 current algebra , while the currents @xmath585 and @xmath586 form the @xmath11 current algebra .",
    "thus a flow from the @xmath587 fixed point to the @xmath11 fixed point occurs if one gives a gap to the @xmath584 modes .",
    "this can be done with the perturbation @xmath588 when @xmath77 goes to @xmath589 , the flow reaches the @xmath11 fixed point . as a tangential comment , note that one can obtain a fermionic realization of the @xmath9 gross - neveu model by perturbing @xmath590 by the @xmath11 currents instead of the @xmath584 ones .",
    "the question now is if this flow implies a low - energy fixed point in any sigma model at @xmath0 .",
    "my conjecture is that it does .",
    "namely , consider the @xmath10 sigma model .",
    "field configurations in this coset space can be realized as a subspace of the @xmath514 configurations .",
    "matrices in the latter are of the form ( [ o2nmat ] ) , where @xmath175 , @xmath351 and @xmath517 are now symmetric @xmath515 matrices . to get @xmath10 requires the restrictions @xmath522 and @xmath523 as before , plus the additional restriction @xmath591 where @xmath592 . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath10 subspace of @xmath514 consists of matrices of the form @xmath593 where @xmath594 is a @xmath515 symmetric unitary matrix obeying the condition ( [ sp ] ) .",
    "one can therefore obtain this model by a perturbation like ( [ ouflow ] ) . here",
    ", the perturbation breaks the @xmath570 global symmetry down to @xmath9 .",
    "it is giving a large gap to the modes outside the @xmath9 subgroup , effectively removing them from the theory .",
    "this is just how the flow described above goes from the @xmath587 wzw model to the @xmath11 model .",
    "it is thus very plausible that the general flows look like those in fig .  2 .",
    "= 4.0 in    this is why i have conjectured that the low - energy fixed point of the @xmath10 sigma model at @xmath0 is the @xmath11 wzw model .",
    "this is certainly true at @xmath35 , because @xmath595 and this becomes the flow in the sphere sigma model .",
    "for @xmath596 , any non - trivial fixed point in @xmath10 should be a perturbation of the @xmath0 fixed point of @xmath514 , namely @xmath590 , which has central charge @xmath5 .",
    "if there is a non - trivial critical point of @xmath10 when @xmath0 , it must have central charge less than @xmath5 , which leaves only @xmath11    further evidence for this conjecture comes from the replica limit @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting model describes the spin quantum hall effect @xcite , and can also be studied in a supersymmetric formulation .",
    "it is found in @xcite that certain correlators are equivalent to those in classical percolation . from this one",
    "can extract the density of states exponent in the disordered model , and indeed it agrees with the result from taking @xmath36 for the corresponding exponent in @xmath11 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are many potential subtleties in taking the replica limit , so this is hardly a proof , but i take it as a good piece of evidence that the conjecture is true .",
    "i have shown that several hierarchies of sigma models flow to a non - trivial low - energy fixed point when @xmath0 .",
    "this provides @xmath38 and @xmath530-symmetric generalizations of the @xmath14 results of @xcite . in another paper",
    ", i will calculate the @xmath44-functions for these models @xcite .",
    "this result is a useful check on the currently - popular approach to disordered models in two dimensions , most recent study has been based on the assumption that that the picture of @xcite is fairly general , and this paper shows that the picture holds for the @xmath332 models ( class @xmath574ii ) and the @xmath3 models ( the gse class ) .",
    "all the models discussed in this paper have wzw models as their non - trivial fixed points .",
    "however , if the model believed to apply to the integer quantum hall plateau phase transition ( the @xmath36 limit of @xmath597 model at @xmath0 @xcite ) has a fixed point , it does not seem likely that it is of wzw type , as argued in @xcite . thus there is still a great deal of interesting physics yet to be uncovered in sigma models with @xmath0 .",
