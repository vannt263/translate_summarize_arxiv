    "the cobe / dmr experiment ( @xcite ) has revolutionized the field of structure formation , providing the first robust evidence for primary , large scale anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . on these angular scales cmb anisotropies",
    "are expected because of potential fluctuations at last scattering ( @xcite ) .",
    "these linear fluctuations are predicted to be constant in time , and then provide a unique tool for determining the initial conditions out of which large scale structure formed . because of the low cobe / dmr angular resolution and of the correspondingly large cosmic variance ( @xcite ) , these initial conditions can not be yet determined with high precision ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in spite of this , scale - invariant initial conditions , a robust prediction of inflation , are indeed consistent with the cobe / dmr four years data ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth remembering that the analysis of these data , based on the assumption of a flat universe , is completely insensitive to the chemistry of the universe .",
    "it seems difficult to reconcile the bulk of the observational data ( cmb anisotropy , bulk flows , galaxy correlation function , etc . ) with a model which is not dynamically dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "however , it does not seems probable that cdm can provide the closure density : if this were the case , the universe would probably be more inhomogeneous than observed on small scales .",
    "the excess power on these scales can be reduced , for example , by considering a low density ( @xmath7 ) cdm dominated model , which is flat because of a suitable cosmological constant , or a mixture of cold and hot dark matter , i.e. mixed dark matter ( mdm ) models . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the latter scenario .",
    "however , just because of the power reduction on small scales , in a mdm model structure formation tends to be a too recent process .",
    "this difficulty can be alleviated by considering initial conditions that are not exactly scale invariant .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the abundance of rich cluster in mdm models can be better reconciled with the x - ray luminosity function by assuming initial `` blue '' power spectra , i.e. @xmath8 with @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "blue power spectra could overproduce small scale cmb anisotropy .",
    "however , a possible late reheating of the intergalactic medium could have controlled the level of anisotropy at or below the degree angular scale . if and when the universe underwent through a phase of early reionization of the intergalactic medium is an interesting and still open question , although from the gunn and peterson ( @xcite ) test we know that the universe must have been highly reionized at redshift @xmath10 , and the presence of heavy elements in the intracluster gas suggest that a considerable energy release occurred during the earliest stages of galaxy formation and evolution",
    "the recent detections of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy at degree angular scales provide a new and powerful way for investigating this issue .",
    "in fact , the level of detected anisotropies at these scales can in principle discriminate among different assumptions for the thermal history of the universe .",
    "also , using large and intermediate angular scales measurements increases the lever arm for determining the primordial spectral index . a definitive answer to these and",
    "other open questions will come when space missions ( e.g. cobras / samba and map ) will provide a robust and definitive picture of the intermediate angular scale anisotropy .",
    "meanwhile , the number of experiments reporting detections of anisotropy at degree angular scales has increased up to a couple of tens ( see table i below ) .",
    "because of their sub - degree angular resolution , these experiments are quite effective in testing different reionization histories .",
    "so , the goal of this paper is to discuss if these anisotropy data , together with cobe / dmr , discriminate among different assumptions for the primordial spectral index @xmath11 and for the thermal history of the universe .",
    "we consider a flat universe ( @xmath12 ) composed by baryons ( @xmath13 ) , cold dark matter ( @xmath14 ) , one family of massive neutrinos ( @xmath15 ) , photons and two families of massless neutrinos . for age considerations we fix @xmath16 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath17 . the basic equations for describing the time evolution of density fluctuations in these different cosmic components have been already derived ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in fourier space",
    ", they are :    @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "eq.(1 ) describes the time evolution of the ( fourier transformed ) fluctuation in the phase space distribution of massive neutrinos : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the ratio between the neutrino momentum @xmath31 and the neutrino temperature ( we use natural units ) , proportional to the cmb temperature , @xmath32 .",
    "the massive neutrino background density is then @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the number of neutrino families with a non vanishing rest mass ( @xmath36 in our case ) , @xmath37 , and each flavour state has two helicity states .",
    "we expand @xmath38 in legendre polynomials , @xmath39 , and transform eq.(1 ) in a set of coupled differential equations for the multipoles @xmath40 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the massive neutrino density contrast reads @xmath41 while @xmath42 \\epsilon^{-1}y g_0 .",
    "$ ] for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . finally , @xmath47 .",
    "the integrals in @xmath48-space giving @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are performed numerically with a 16 points gauss - laguerre integration method .",
    "eq.(2 ) describes massless neutrinos , and it is obtained by integrating in @xmath48- space eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the ultra - relativistic limit ( @xmath53 ) : @xmath54 .",
    "again we expand @xmath55 in legendre polynomials , @xmath56 and transform eq .",
    "( 2 ) in a set of 40 coupled differential equations .",
    "the density fluctuations of massless neutrinos is @xmath57 , while @xmath58 .",
    "we numerically follow the evolution of fluctuations in this component only when the perturbation proper wavelength is larger than one tenth of the horizon . afterwards , free streaming rapidly damps fluctuations in this hot component .",
    "eq.(3 ) describes fluctuations in the @xmath59 and @xmath60 stokes parameters of the cmb ( see e.g. @xcite ) and differs from eq .",
    "( 2 ) because of the collisional term , proportional to the thomson cross section , @xmath61 , and to the electronic number density , @xmath62 .",
    "the latter is evaluated assuming a standard recombination history ( @xcite ) , with a helium mass fraction @xmath63 .",
    "we expand @xmath64 and @xmath65 in legendre polinomials : @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the number of harmonics is automatically increased up to @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "the correlation function ( acf ) of the temperature fluctuations can be written as @xmath70 \\eqno(9)\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the dispersion of a gaussian approximating the angular response of the beam , and @xmath72 we define the parameter @xmath73 as the amplitude @xmath74 of the power spectrum ( considered as a free parameter ) in units of @xmath75 , the amplitude needed to reproduce @xmath76 , as observed by cobe - dmr ( @xcite ) .    performing the integral in eq.(10 ) with high accuracy at high @xmath77 s",
    "requires a very good sampling of the @xmath78 s in @xmath79-space , and this is a heavy computational task . to avoid this problem we sample the interval @xmath80 with a step @xmath81",
    ", we evaluate the integral in eq.(10 ) , and we use a smoothing algorithm to suppress the high frequency , sample noise .",
    "the @xmath82 s obtained in this way differ from those obtained with a much denser @xmath79-space sampling ( @xmath83 ) by only a fraction of percent up to @xmath84 .",
    "the time evolution of the baryon and cdm density contrasts and of the baryon peculiar velocity are described by eq.(6 ) , ( 8) and ( 7 ) respectively .",
    "the system is closed by eq.(4 ) and ( 5 ) describing the field equations for the trace and the @xmath85 component of the metric perturbation tensor .",
    "we numerically integrate the previous equations from redshift @xmath86 up to the present . in the following",
    "we will also assume that the universe reionized instantaneously at redshift @xmath87 , and remained completely reionized up to the present . because of the low baryonic abundance , we need reionization at high redshifts in order to substantially suppress the anisotropy at degree scales . for @xmath88 and @xmath89 ,",
    "there is a probability lower than 50 @xmath5 for a photon to scatter against a free electron at @xmath90 .",
    "we have selected a set of 20 different anisotropy detections obtained by different experiments , or by the same experiment with different window functions and/or at different frequencies . for each detection , labeled by the index @xmath91 , we report in table 1 the detected mean square anisotropy , @xmath92 , and the corresponding 1@xmath93 error , @xmath94 . in our error estimates , the calibration error was added in quadrature to the statistical error . when not explicitly given , we estimated the mean square anisotropy as follows : @xmath95 - \\sigma_j^2 $ ] , where @xmath96 are the published anisotropy data of the @xmath91-th experiment , @xmath97 $ ] is the variance of the data points , and @xmath98 is the mean square value of the instrumental noise .    theoretically , the mean ( over the ensemble ) squared anisotropy is given by a weighted sum of the @xmath82 s : @xmath99 = { 1 \\over 4\\pi } \\sum_\\ell ( 2 \\ell + 1 ) c_\\ell w_{\\ell , j}=    \\overline { { c_{\\ell_{eff}}}\\over{4\\pi } } \\sum_\\ell   ( 2 \\ell + 1 ) w_{\\ell , j } \\eqno ( 13)\\ ] ] where the windows function @xmath100 contains all the experimental details ( chop , modulation , beam , etc . ) , and @xmath101 is the mean value of the @xmath82 s over the window function .",
    "the effective multipole number @xmath102 is defined as follows : @xmath103 and is listed in table i for a scale invariant model without reionization .",
    "although in principle model dependent , the values of @xmath104 are quite stable because of the narrowness in @xmath77 space of the window functions .    using numerical simulations , which take into account scan strategy and experimental noise , we verify that the expected distribution for @xmath105 is well approximated by a gaussian , with mean @xmath106 and a cosmic / sampling variance @xmath107 here @xmath108 represents the fraction of the sky sampled by each experiment and it is also listed in table i.    given the gaussian distribution of @xmath109 , we compute the likelihood of the 20 ( assumed independent ) cmb anisotropy detections as follows : @xmath110 } } \\exp \\bigl\\{- { 1 \\over 2 }   { \\bigl[\\delta _ j^{(exp ) } - { \\cal a}^2 \\delta^{(th)}_j\\bigl]^2 \\over   { \\cal a}^4 \\bigl ( \\delta^{(th)}_j \\bigr)^2 +   \\sigma_j ^2 } \\bigr\\ } \\eqno ( 15)\\ ] ] as already stated , this is a function of three parameters : the amplitude @xmath111 , the spectral index @xmath11 and the reionization redshift @xmath1 .    for each pair",
    "@xmath112 we select the value @xmath113 which maximizes the likelihood ( isolevels of @xmath113 are shown in fig.1 for @xmath114 , respectively ) .",
    "the results of our theoretical calculation are shown in fig.2a , where we plot the @xmath82 s for few models , each of them normalized with its own @xmath113 .",
    "our results show that the difference between a pure cdm and a mdm ( @xmath115 ) models , normalized with the same @xmath113 is very tiny , @xmath116 up to @xmath117 and @xmath118 up to @xmath119 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so we will make hereafter the assumption that the anisotropy pattern does not depend on @xmath120 , at least for @xmath121 .",
    "this generalizes our assumption that the cmb anisotropy depends only upon three independent variables : @xmath111 , @xmath11 and @xmath1 . for the models shown in fig.1a we also plot the band - power estimate for the @xmath91-th experiment @xmath122 and in fig.1b the corresponding window functions , @xmath123 .",
    "the 2-d , conditional distribution @xmath124 has a quite distinctive peak at @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "a @xmath127-confidence level contour in the @xmath112 is obtained cutting the @xmath128 distribution with the isolevel @xmath129 , and by requiring that the volume below the surface inside @xmath129 is a fraction @xmath127 of the total volume . in fig.3",
    "we plot the @xmath130 and the @xmath131 contours , again for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively ( we actually sampled a region of the @xmath112 plane much larger than shown in figure ) .",
    "it is clear that the considered data set identifies a preferred region of the @xmath134 space .",
    "the shape of the confidence contours can be understood by noting that increasing @xmath11 would overproduce anisotropies : a corresponding increase in @xmath1 is thus required to damp the fluctuations to a level compatible with observations . on the other hand , if @xmath135 is increased , the optical depth increases , thus requiring a lower reionization redshift to produce the detected level of degree - scale anisotropy .",
    "this effect dominates over the smaller increase of primary cmb anisotropies .",
    "the simple analysis carried out here does not take into account details on the scan pattern and/or the beam profile .",
    "moreover , we know that the published error bars could not account properly for correlated errors or other more subtle effects . in order to test the significance of our analysis and its robustness against the published estimates for the experimental errors , we take a drastic point of view : we consider the best fit model ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) normalized to cobe / dmr ( i.e. we fix @xmath138 ) . for each degree",
    " scale data point we compute the difference between the measured value and the value expected from the theory .",
    "we then associate to each data point a 1@xmath93 error bar equal to the root mean square of these 19 differences ( instead of the published error bars ) .",
    "the corresponding results of the likelihood analysis are in very good agreement with what is found using the appropriate errors : @xmath139 is slightly better , especially if the reionization redshift is increased .",
    "so we do believe that our results are little affected by possible correlations in the errors and/or systematics .",
    "our main conclusions , derived from fig.3 , are as follows .",
    "the conditional likelihood shows a maximum for @xmath125 and @xmath140 , for @xmath141 , i.e. for baryonic abundances consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "we have checked the stability of this result by applying a jack - knife analysis to the considered data set , and we have seen that the results are reasonably stable : the best model has always @xmath142 and @xmath143 , unless cobe data are excluded ( in that case @xmath144 and @xmath126 ) .",
    "the 95@xmath5 confidence contours in the @xmath112 plane include a wide range of parameters combinations .",
    "this means that the presently available data set is not sensitive enough to produce `` precise '' determinations for @xmath11 and @xmath1 ; systematic and statistical errors in the different experiments are still significant .",
    "\\3 . if we exclude an early reionization of the intergalactic medium ( @xmath145 ) we get the following @xmath146 confidence level estimates for the spectral index : @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) ; @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) ; @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "this has to be compared to the results from cobe - dmr alone : @xmath153 , at the @xmath154 confidence level ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , in spite of their still low signal to noise ratio , the degree scale experiments already allow to better constrain the spectral index , although still at the @xmath155 level .",
    "note that the `` standard '' , flat model with no reionization is close but not always inside the @xmath146 confidence contour .",
    "however , this result is determined mainly by the saskatoon experiment .",
    "in fact , we tested the stability of our results by repeating the analysis several times , excluding one experiment at the time . if we do not consider reionization , the @xmath156 c.l .",
    "interval @xmath149 does not change more than a few @xmath5 excluding either argo , cat , max , msam , south pole or tenerife .",
    "the lower limit drops to @xmath157 if the saskatoon data are excluded , while the upper limit raises to @xmath158 if the cobe data are excluded .",
    "this test also shows that neglecting the correlation due to overlapping sky coverage ( e.g. tenerife and cobe , and/or msam and saskatoon ) does not change significantly the results of our analysis .    \\4 . for scale invariant models with no reionization ,",
    "the height of the first `` doppler '' peak occurs at @xmath159 and is a factor of @xmath160 higher than the sachs - wolfe plateau at low @xmath77 s . for @xmath161",
    "the peak amplitude is roughly a factor @xmath162 higher than in the scale - invariant case . a complete reionization from @xmath163 up to the present suppress the peak by roughly @xmath164 .",
    "altogether , a model with @xmath161 and @xmath137 has a doppler peak a factor of @xmath165 higher than in the standard scale invariant case without reheating .",
    "so our analysis confirms that a doppler peak in the @xmath82 spectrum centered at @xmath166 is perfectly consistent with the data .",
    "all the models we have worked with have , as stated above , @xmath167 .",
    "in flat models with vanishing cosmological constant we can expect @xmath168 from the estimated age of globular clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "varying @xmath169 modifies the amplitude and position of the acoustic peaks in the radiation power spectrum .",
    "however , we have verified that , in the region of the spectrum probed by current anisotropy experiments , @xmath164 variations of the hubble constant yeld modifications in the spectrum very similar to those obtained varying @xmath135 between 0.03 and 0.07 . also , we did not consider tensor modes in our analysis , as they are expected to be of negligible amplitude for @xmath139 ( @xcite )",
    "we will address this issue in a forthcoming paper .",
