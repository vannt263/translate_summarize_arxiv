    "in the field of molecular electronics , research has so far mostly concentrated on the dc electrical conduction properties of single - molecule contacts.@xcite by now it is known that the charge transport through organic molecules is typically due to electron tunneling .",
    "this is evidenced in particular by the exponential decay of the conductance @xmath0 with increasing molecular length in contacts formed from oligomers with varying numbers of units.@xcite considering the statistical nature of experiments at the molecular scale , a conclusive comparison to theory is presently difficult . nevertheless , associated decay coefficients appear to be reproduced by theoretical calculations.@xcite for a deeper understanding of molecular - size contacts , it is useful to analyze also other observables in parallel with the dc conductance .",
    "emerging new lines of research involve the photoconductance@xcite and heat transport.@xcite in this paper we concentrate on the thermopower . for metallic atomic contacts ,",
    "this quantity was studied experimentally already some years ago,@xcite but for molecular contacts only very recently.@xcite    the thermopower @xmath1 , also known as the seebeck coefficient , measures the voltage @xmath2 induced over a conducting material at vanishing steady state electric current @xmath3 , when a small temperature difference @xmath4 is applied : @xmath5 .",
    "it is known that in bulk materials the sign of the thermopower is a hint of the sign of the main charge carriers .",
    "if @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , charge is carried by electron - like ( hole - like ) quasiparticle excitations , as in an @xmath8-doped ( @xmath9-doped ) semiconductor.@xcite analogously , the thermopower of the molecular junction gives information about the alignment of the energies of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( homo and lumo ) with respect to the metal s fermi energy @xmath10.@xcite in the experiment,@xcite @xmath1 was measured for gold electrodes bridged by dithiolated oligophenylene molecules .",
    "it was found to be positive , which indicates that @xmath10 lies closer to the homo than to the lumo .",
    "also , it was observed that @xmath1 grows roughly linearly with the number @xmath11 of the phenyl rings in the molecule .",
    "more recently@xcite the effects of substituents and varied end groups have been analyzed for the benzene molecule .    using transport calculations based on density - functional theory ( dft )",
    "we investigate in this paper the length dependence of the conductance and the seebeck coefficient for dithiolated oligophenylenes bonded to gold contacts . for the molecules studied in ref .  , we find that the conductance decays exponentially with increasing molecular length .",
    "decay coefficients compare reasonably with previous dft calculations@xcite and also with experiments,@xcite considering differences in contact configurations , molecular end groups , and uncertainties with respect to environmental effects .",
    "in addition , the thermopower increases linearly , with a magnitude coinciding with the measurements.@xcite we also study how the results change as various numbers of methyl substituents are introduced to the molecules .",
    "the effect of these substituents is twofold : ( i ) they push the energies of the @xmath12 electrons up as a result of their electron - donating behavior@xcite and ( ii ) they increase the tilt angles between the phenyl rings through steric repulsion .",
    "the latter effect tends to decrease both @xmath0 and @xmath1 due to a reduction of the degree of @xmath12-electron delocalization , while the former opposes this tendency by bringing the homo closer to @xmath10 .",
    "a simplified @xmath12-orbital model is used to explain essential features of the dft results .",

    "[ sec : discussion - and - conclusions ] with a discussion and conclusions .",
    "the general formulas for the treatment of thermoelectric effects , based on the landauer - bttiker formalism , are discussed in detail in several references.@xcite by expanding the expression for the current @xmath3 to linear order in @xmath2 and @xmath4 and considering the cases @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , one arrives at @xmath15 with @xmath16de$ ] , @xmath17de$ ] , and @xmath18 . here",

    "( [ eq : gands ] ) .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq : gands_lowt ] ) approximates the results to within a few percent at room temperature , since @xmath19 is smooth around @xmath10 due to the off - resonant situation .",
    "it should be noted that the equations neglect electron - vibration interactions .",
    "these could in principle be included by adding the inelastic corrections to the expression for the current,@xcite but we expect also these contributions to be relatively small even at room temperature .",
    "the transmission functions are computed with the help of green s function techniques .",
    "the electronic structure is described in terms of dft as implemented in the quantum chemistry program turbomole v5.7 , where we employ the bp86 exchange - correlation functional and the standard gaussian basis set of split valence quality with polarization functions on all non - hydrogen atoms.@xcite for further details on our method , see refs .  .",

    "the homo and lumo energies of the molecules are shown in fig .",

    "it can be noticed that the homo - lumo gaps of the s and d series are larger than those of the r series .    to form the junctions , each molecule",

    "the results for the transmission , its logarithmic derivative , the conductance , and the thermopower for all of the r , s , and d type molecular junctions are collected in fig .",

    "with increasing number @xmath11 of phenyl rings , the conductance decays as @xmath34 [ fig .  [ cap : dftresults](c ) ] . for the r series , we find the decay coefficient @xmath35,@xcite in good agreement with theory of ref .",
    ".@xcite previous theoretical estimates@xcite and experimental results@xcite for thiolated self - assembled monolayers are consistently somewhat larger than this value . in particular , the results reported in ref",

    "this increase reflects the reduced delocalization of the @xmath12-electron system .",
    "the absolute conductance values of s and d are very similar to each other .    since the fermi energy at @xmath41 ev lies closer to the homo than to the lumo level",

    "[ cap : dftresults](d ) ] .",
    "we also find that @xmath1 increases roughly linearly with @xmath11 , as suggested by the experiments.@xcite indeed , assuming that the transmission around @xmath42 is of the form @xmath43 , then eq .",
    "( [ eq : gands_lowt ] ) yields @xmath44 , where @xmath45'/3e$ ] and @xmath46.@xcite two things should be noted here .",
    "first , @xmath1 does not necessarily extrapolate to zero for @xmath47 , leading to a finite `` contact thermopower '' @xmath48 .",

    "best fits to our results and the experimental data give @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath21v / k , respectively .",
    "differences in the fit parameters mainly stem from the data point for r3 , where the experimental value is lower than calculated . considering the reported order - of - magnitude discrepancies between measured conductances and those computed from dft,@xcite the agreement still appears reasonable.@xcite however , for large enough @xmath55 and @xmath11 the abovementioned exponential and linear laws for the length dependences of @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "should be modified due to interactions with the thermal environment.@xcite the fact that the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ cap : dftresults](d ) exhibit a rather good linearity suggests that molecular vibrations do not play a crucial role and that the electronic contribution to @xmath1 is dominant .",
    "although the conductances for s and d are very similar , their thermopowers are rather different .",
    "furthermore , the magnitudes for @xmath56 follow the surprising order @xmath57.@xcite as we will discuss below , these observations can be understood through the two competing substituent effects : ( i ) a change in the alignment of the @xmath12-electron levels with respect to @xmath10 as a result of the electron - donating nature of the methyl group@xcite and ( ii ) an increase in the ring - tilt angles . for the isolated molecules the second effect results in the opening of the homo - lumo gap when going from molecules r to s or d , while the first effect causes the difference between the homo and lumo energies of the s and d series ( fig .",
    "[ cap : hlplot ] ) .",
    "in order to gain some understanding of the general features of the dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the number of substituents , we study a simple tight - binding ( tb ) model , which describes the @xmath12-electron system of the oligophenylenes ( fig .  [ cap : model ] ) .",
    "the onsite energies @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) are equal on all carbon atoms of phenyl ring @xmath60 , the intra - ring hopping @xmath61 is assumed to be the same everywhere , and the inter - ring hopping @xmath62 is parametrized through @xmath63 . we assume the effect of the side groups to come into play only through @xmath31 and @xmath58 .",
    "the leads are modeled by  wide - band  self - energies @xmath64 , acting on the terminal carbon atoms .",
    "we extract the parameters of our model as follows . for the r molecules , we set @xmath65 . in the s and d molecules , the @xmath58 s for rings with one , two , or four",
    "methyl groups are obtained by performing dft calculations of methylbenzene , dimethylbenzene , and tetramethylbenzene ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dft - benzene - shift ] ) .",
    "we find that the homo and lumo energies in these molecules shift upwards monotonously with the number of methyl substituents .",
    "this can be attributed to the electron - donating character of the methyl groups , and the resulting increase of coulomb repulsion on the phenyl ring .",
    "we use the averages of the homo and lumo shifts relative to benzene , and obtain , respectively , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ev.@xcite the onsite energies of the different phenyl rings of the r , s , and d molecules with @xmath24 are schematically represented in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ cap : model ] .",
    "the hopping @xmath61 is set to half of ( the negative of ) the homo - lumo gap of benzene , with the result @xmath69 ev ( fig .",
    "[ cap : hlplot ] ) .",
    "the scattering rate @xmath70 and the tilt angles for r , s , and d molecules are chosen to reproduce approximately the minimal transmissions for r1 , r2 , s2 , and d2 in the dft results of fig .",
    "[ cap : dftresults](a ) .",
    "this yields @xmath71 ev , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the last free parameter is @xmath10 , which should be determined by the overall charge - transfer effects between the molecule and the electrodes .",
    "we choose its value of @xmath75 ev close to the crossing points of the transmission curves of the s and d molecules [ cf .  figs .",
    "[ cap : dftresults](a ) and [ cap : modelresults](a ) ] .",
    "similar features can be recognized between the dft results and our model . in particular , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : modelresults](b ) , the correct order of the thermopowers is reproduced . in going from r to s ,",
    "the increase in the tilt angle and the associated breaking of the @xmath12-electron conjugation dominates over other side group effects . as a result both @xmath0 [ fig .",
    "[ cap : modelresults](c ) ] and @xmath1 [ fig .",
    "[ cap : modelresults](d ) ] decrease . in going from s to d ,",
    "an interplay of the sidegroup - induced level shifts and a small residual increase in @xmath31 raises @xmath1 above the value for r , while @xmath0 remains almost unchanged .",
    "we note that for an @xmath11-ring junction the lowest - order terms in an expansion of the transmission in powers of @xmath62 yield @xmath31-dependences of the form @xmath76 , for @xmath77.@xcite independently of @xmath11 , this results in @xmath78 , where we find @xmath79 in our case . for @xmath80 , the neglect of the @xmath81-term leads to the well - known `` @xmath82 law '' of @xmath0,@xcite but we see that for the tilt - angle dependence of @xmath1 the presence of this term is significant , since @xmath83 if @xmath84 .",
    "when @xmath10 is close to a resonance , further higher - order terms become increasingly important and deviations from the @xmath85 law result .",
    "this is seen most clearly as the non - monotonous @xmath31-dependence of @xmath1 for molecule d3 in fig .",
    "[ cap : modelresults](d ) .",
    "close to perpendicular ring tilts results from the @xmath12-orbital model should be taken with care . at @xmath86",
    "the @xmath12-@xmath12 coupling @xmath62 vanishes , and any other couplings between the rings will become important.@xcite let us analyze this for the biphenyl molecules r2 , s2 , and d2 . for them , we have varied the tilt angle between the rings , and have determined the charge transport properties for every @xmath31 using our dft - based approach .",
    "further details of the procedure are described in ref .  . for r2 ( and similarly for s2 and d2 )",
    "we observe that for most tilt angles ( @xmath87 ) the transmission is dominated by a single channel [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tphir2_sphir2s2d2](a ) ] of @xmath12-@xmath12 character .    however , at large angles two transmission channels of the same magnitude are observed , which become degenerate at @xmath86 .",
    "they arise from @xmath88-@xmath12 couplings between the two rings , whose strengths are proportional to @xmath89 .",
    "thus the two degenerate channels are of the @xmath88-@xmath12 and @xmath12-@xmath88 type .",
    "these features are obviously not accounted for by the tb model , where only a single @xmath12-@xmath12 channel is present independently of @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath88-@xmath12 couplings should also modify the tilt - angle dependence of the thermopower , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tphir2_sphir2s2d2](b ) . due to the electron - donating nature of the methyl groups the thermopower at fixed @xmath31 increases from r2 to s2 and d2 . while the curve for r2 can be described by the law @xmath85 for @xmath87 , a dip",
    "is observed for larger @xmath31 .",
    "similar deviations in @xmath1 are also present for s2 and d2 , where we have investigated a smaller tilt - angle interval because of the steric repulsion of the methyl groups.@xcite    the degeneracy of the transmission channels is due to the @xmath90 symmetry of biphenyl when @xmath86.@xcite for the longer oligophenylenes the symmetry @xmath90 can occur if and only if tilt angles are all at @xmath91 and the number of rings is even . hence for s2 , s4 , d2 , and d4 the ratio @xmath92 of the first two transmission channels should be particularly large .",
    "such even - odd oscillations are indeed visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : t1overt2 ] for the s and d series , while they are absent for r.    owing to the fact that tilt - angles deviate from @xmath91 , the oscillations decay .",
    "in particular @xmath92 is much smaller for s4 than for d4 , where the minimal tilt angles in the contacts are @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "as is well known , there are many theoretical uncertainties involved in the determination of transport properties based on dft calculations , and improvements for the methods of molecular - scale transport theory are currently being sought.@xcite indeed , it is typical to find order - of - magnitude differences between measured conductances and those computed within dft.@xcite it is also known that atomic configurations can have a strong influence on the conductance,@xcite and hence a conclusive comparison with experimental data would require the statistical analysis of a large number of contact geometries .",
    "however , models predict @xmath1 to be insensitive to changes in the lead couplings,@xcite and hence it is expected to be a more robust quantity that @xmath0 .",
    "although the measurements of ref .   were carried out at room temperature , we do not expect molecular vibrations to play an essential role in the results due to the weakness of the electron - vibration coupling .",
    "thus , the comparison we have made with our elastic transport theory seems justified .",
    "nevertheless , the investigation of the effect of molecular vibrations is an interesting direction for future research , also in view of optimizing the properties of molecular thermoelectric devices for potential applications . as far as gaining a basic understanding is concerned",
    ", low - temperature measurements would be desirable to remove uncertainties related to the thermal excitation of vibrations .",
    "the purpose of the present work was to study the general trends for a series of molecules that are similarly coupled to the electrodes , and considering all the potential uncertainties , the agreement we obtain for the thermopower appears to be quite reasonable .    in conclusion , we have analyzed the length dependence of conductance and thermopower for oligophenylene single - molecule contacts . while we found the conductance to decay exponentially with the length of the molecule , we observe that the thermopower increases linearly . for possible future applications it is interesting to know , how the magnitudes of these quantities can be tuned .",
    "we analyzed how this can be achieved by chemical substituents , which control the fermi - level alignment and the molecular conformation .",
    "we demonstrated that a simple @xmath12-electron tight - binding model can help to understand basic substituent effects .",
    "in addition , we observed an even - odd effect for transmission channel degeneracies upon variation of the number of phenyl rings , which we explained by molecular symmetries .",
