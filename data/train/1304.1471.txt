    "in recent years , the measurement of harmonic flow coefficients @xmath0 has provided important insight into the hot and dense matter created in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "these coefficients are generally obtained from a fourier expansion of the particle distribution in azimuthal angle @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath0 and @xmath8 represent the magnitude and phase ( event plane or ep angle ) of the @xmath9-order anisotropy .",
    "the coefficients @xmath0 stem from the hydrodynamic response to various shape components or eccentricities @xmath10 of the created matter . in non - central heavy ion collisions , @xmath11 is mainly associated with the `` elliptic '' shape of the nuclear overlap region .",
    "however , @xmath11 in central collisions and the other @xmath10 terms arise primarily from fluctuations of the nucleon positions in the overlap region  @xcite .",
    "model calculations suggest that @xmath0 scales nearly linearly with @xmath10 , for @xmath12 and 3  @xcite .",
    "the proportionality constant is found to be sensitive to the properties of the matter , such as the equation of state and shear viscosity  @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 coefficients for @xmath136  @xcite have established the importance of the fluctuations in the initial state , and provided quantitative constraints on the transport properties of the created matter .",
    "most of these measurements focus on the @xmath0 values averaged over many events , which mainly reflect the hydrodynamic response of the created matter to the average collision geometry in the initial state .",
    "estimation of the second moment of @xmath0 distribution for n=2 has been obtained via a monte carlo template fit  @xcite , or two- and four - particle cumulant methods  @xcite .",
    "recently the atlas collaboration made the first measurement of the probability distribution of charged hadron @xmath0 , @xmath14  @xcite , as well as the correlations between two or three ep angles of different order  @xcite in pb+pb collisions at @xmath15 tev .",
    "these new types of flow measurements provide additional information on the nature of the fluctuations in the initial geometry and the non - linear effects in the hydrodynamic evolution@xcite .",
    "the study of these new observables requires new experimental techniques .",
    "atlas extracts the @xmath14 using a data - driven bayesian unfolding method based on the event - by - event ( ebye ) distribution of either the single - particle @xmath6 or the pair @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the key step in the atlas measurement is to determine a response function which connects the observed signal @xmath17 with the true @xmath0 signal , @xmath18 .",
    "the response function is then used to unfold the @xmath17 distributions to obtain the true @xmath0 distributions , using the bayesian unfolding technique  @xcite .",
    "the response function mainly corrects for the smearing due to the effect of finite per - event charged particle multiplicity , but is also shown to reduce nonflow effects .",
    "the efficacy of the method has been demonstrated using many data - driven cross - checks , however , a detailed monte - carlo study can provide a direct check of the performance of the method , as well as a measure of the influence of nonflow effects .    in this paper , the performance of bayesian unfolding , used by the atlas collaboration to extract the @xmath0 distribution , is studied using the hijing  @xcite and ampt  @xcite event generators .",
    "we show that the unfolding procedure indeed accounts for the effects associated with finite multiplicity and nonflow .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : section  [ sec:1 ] gives a brief review of the unfolding method developed for the data analysis .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] demonstrates the basic performance of the unfolding procedure via a toy model simulation that includes only statistical smearing .",
    "the influence of nonflow effects is studied in section  [ sec:3 ] by applying the unfolding procedure to hijing events with and without a flow afterburner .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] gives a study of the @xmath0 distributions in ampt events .",
    "section  [ sec:5 ] gives a summary of the results .",
    "section  [ sec:6 ] discusses the prospect of applying the method to the study of the azimuthal correlation in high - energy collisions .",
    "the atlas analysis method starts with a fourier expansion of the azimuthal distribution of charged particles in a given event : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the magnitude of the observed per - particle flow vector : @xmath21 . in the limit of large multiplicity and the absence of nonflow effects",
    ", it approaches the true flow signal : @xmath22 .",
    "hence one needs to determine the response function @xmath23 or @xmath24 , which can be used to unfold these smearing effects .",
    "the response function is determined via a two - subevents method ( 2se ) : the charged particles are divided into two equal subevents with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the smearing effects are estimated from the distribution of the difference of the flow vectors between the two subevents , @xmath27 , for which the physical flow signal cancels .",
    "this distribution is observed to be well described by a 2d gaussian with identical widths , @xmath28 , in both dimensions and hence the response function can be obtained as : @xmath29\\right ) \\\\\\label{eq:2b } & \\approx&\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\delta_n^2 } e^{-\\frac{\\left(\\overrightharp{v}^{\\mathrm{\\;obs}}_n-\\overrightharp{v}_n\\right)^2}{2\\delta_n^2 } } , \\delta_n=\\delta_{_{\\mathrm{2se}}}/2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor of two accounts for the fact that the smearing in @xmath30 is a factor of two narrower than that for @xmath31 .",
    "consequently the 1d response function can be obtained by integrating out the azimuthal angle : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "[ eq:3 ] is known as the bessel - gaussian ( bg ) function  @xcite , which is a very good approximation of the response function . in atlas data analysis ,",
    "the actual distribution , obtained by shifting the measured 2d distribution eq .",
    "[ eq:2a ] to @xmath34 and integrating out the azimuthal angle , is used in the unfolding .    the bayesian unfolding procedure from  @xcite is used to obtain the @xmath0 distribution .",
    "in this procedure , the true @xmath0 ( cause `` c '' ) distribution is obtained from the measured @xmath20 ( effect `` e '' ) distribution and the response function @xmath35 , using an iterative procedure : @xmath36 the unfolding matrix @xmath37 is determined from the response function and initial guess of the true distribution @xmath38 ( referred to as prior ) , and the process is iterated .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath2 distributions were shown to converge after a few iterations , while more iterations ( @xmath39 ) were needed for @xmath4 .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to verify the convergence of the unfolding via simulations .",
    "the atlas results also show that the response function ( eq .  [ eq:3 ] ) not only accounts for the smearing effect , but also for the nonflow contributions .",
    "the argument goes as follows : most of the nonflow effects arise from localized clusters each containing a few particles , and the number of such clusters is proportional to the total multiplicity .",
    "therefore , the nonflow contributions to @xmath40 is of a similar nature as that for the response function which is obtained from @xmath31 .",
    "thus , most of the short - range nonflow effects can be removed by the unfolding procedure .",
    "this can be verified directly via a monte - carlo event generator such as hijing  @xcite as discussed later .",
    "the toy model simulation serves as a proof - of - principle check for the unfolding method .",
    "the multiplicity of each event is generated according to a gaussian distribution with a mean of @xmath41 and a width of @xmath42 .",
    "this roughly simulates the distribution of the number of reconstructed charged particles for @xmath43 gev/@xmath44 and @xmath45 in 20 - 25% pb+pb collisions at @xmath15 tev in atlas , assuming a 70% reconstruction efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the input @xmath0 signal is obtained by a bessel - gaussian function that is parameterized to the atlas data as shown in figure  [ fig : in ] .",
    "particles in a given event are implemented to have the same @xmath0 value , which is sampled from the bg functions .",
    "the particles are then randomly divided into two subevents with equal multiplicity .",
    "the correlations of the per - particle flow vectors between the two subevents are then used to calculate the response function .",
    "about 2.5 million events were generated ; this is similar to the statistics used in the atlas data analysis for the 20 - 25% centrality bin .",
    "figure  [ fig : toy ] shows the performance of the bayesian unfolding for different number of iteration ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the response function ( thin solid curves ) are significantly narrower than the @xmath47 distribution for @xmath12 and @xmath48 , leading to convergence to the input distribution after a few iterations ( see ratios for @xmath49 ) .",
    "however the convergence for @xmath50 is slower due to its much smaller @xmath0 signal .",
    "this overall performance is similar to what is observed in the data analysis  @xcite .",
    "understanding the nonflow effects in any flow measurement is a topic of intense debate over the last several years  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the nonflow correlations refer to statistical smearing due to a finite number of observed particles , short - range correlations among few particles such as resonance decays , bose - einstein correlation and fragments of individual jets , as well as long - range correlations not related to flow such as global momentum conservation ( gmc ) and fragments from di - jets . note that most flow methods are not sensitive to pure statistical smearing , but it is listed as part of nonflow since it appears explicitly in the ebye distributions .",
    "also note that the gmc effect is a global correlation that mainly affects the @xmath51 , and the correlations between two back - to - back jets involve a few particles but can be long - range in @xmath52 , affecting mainly the even harmonics .",
    "these nonflow correlations and their fluctuations are naturally included in the hijing event generator and has been used frequently in previous investigations of nonflow effects  @xcite .    since hijing does not have physical flow",
    ", any non - zero @xmath20 values must be solely due to nonflow .",
    "however , we can also impose a physical flow signal on the particles using a flow afterburner , such that the generated events contain both the nonflow and flow contributions that fluctuate event - by - event .",
    "the bayesian unfolding procedure can be used to extract the @xmath0 distributions for comparison with the input .",
    "this allows a quantitative estimate of how the nonflow effects and their ebye fluctuations affect the final extracted @xmath0 distributions .",

    "the event multiplicity roughly corresponds to 0 - 1% , 5 - 10% , 20 - 25% and 50 - 55%",
    "centrality ranges in the data .",
    "the experimentally measured @xmath0 distributions in these four centrality ranges are parameterized individually by the bg functions .",
    "these functions are then used as the input @xmath0 distributions to be imposed on the hijing events .",
    "the unfolding procedure is repeated for all four impact parameters , but the results for @xmath55  fm are often used for illustrative purposes . in order to gain maximum sensitivity to the nonflow effects , all particles , including neutral particles , above 0.5 gev/@xmath44 and @xmath45 are used .      the goal of hijing simulation without a flow afterburner is to understand the basic properties of the response function and the contributions of non - flow effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : hia0 ] shows the @xmath54-axis projections ( the @xmath59-axis projections are identical ) of the difference of the per - particle flow vector between the two symmetric subevents ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 .",
    "they are shown for @xmath127 in events with @xmath55  fm .",
    "these distributions are well described by a gaussian , implying that the smearing effects and those due to nonflow short - range correlations are largely statistical .",
    "figure  [ fig : hia0b ] shows similar distributions for various impact parameters for @xmath12 .",
    "significant non - gaussian behavior is observed for peripheral collisions ( i.e. @xmath58  fm ) . in this case , the distribution can be described by the student s t - distribution  @xcite , which is a general probability distribution function for the difference between two estimates of the mean from independent samples . the t - distribution approaches a gaussian distribution when the event multiplicity is large .",
    "the distributions shown in figures  [ fig : hia0 ] and [ fig : hia0b ] are used to obtain the response functions according to eq .",
    "[ eq:2a ] .    since @xmath60 , in the limit of pure statistical smearing",
    ", the response function reduces to the @xmath61 distribution , and is a 2d gaussian centered around the origin : @xmath62 the @xmath59 or @xmath54 width of the 2d response function or @xmath63 can be calculated from the central limit theorem as ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is total number of particles used in the event and the weight for each particle @xmath66 is taken to be one ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this width is the limit expected for pure statistical smearing .",
    "additional nonflow correlations tend to increase this width .",
    "for example , if the @xmath65 particles come from @xmath68 resonance decays each with @xmath69 number of particles with the same @xmath6 angle , the distribution is still a gaussian but with a larger width : @xmath70    in the data analysis , the response function is obtained by 2se method via eq .",

    "the average @xmath74 values are calculated directly in hijing for the four impact parameters , and they are found to be @xmath750.05% , 0.07% , 0.14% and 0.4% , respectively .",
    "this implies that the relative multiplicity fluctuation between the subevents has negligible effects as long as the input @xmath0 distribution and total multiplicity @xmath76 remain unchanged .",

    "[ eq : hia2 ] can be generalized to other short - range correlations as long as the number of sources are proportional to the total multiplicity .",
    "on the other hand , long - range correlations such as di - jets can correlate between the two subevents ( with each subevent containing one jet ) , and hence their influence to the response function may differ from eq .",

    "@xmath100 is allowed as a free parameter for @xmath12 but is fixed to be 0 for @xmath86 .",
    "the unfolding performance are shown in figure  [ fig : hic1 ] , the influence of nonflow is reflected by the difference between the unfolded results for the two response functions .",
    "the difference is small for @xmath3 , but become quite sizable in the tails for @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "one important finding in the atlas analysis is that the shape of the @xmath0 distributions is nearly independent of the @xmath5 of the particles used ( in the low @xmath5 region ) .",
    "this is checked directly in the ampt simulation .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig : hic2 ] suggest an approximate scaling , although significant deviations are observed for @xmath3 in the tails .",
    "the performance of the bayesian unfolding method for extracting the @xmath0 probability distributions , is evaluated with a toy model simulation , as well as with hijing and ampt monte - carlo model simulations .",
    "this unfolding method has been used previously by the atlas collaboration to obtain the @xmath0 distribution for for @xmath102 . in the absence of nonflow effects , the unfolding method is demonstrated to converge reliably to the input distributions for @xmath1 for the typical event multiplicity used in the lhc experiments .",
    "the effects of the nonflow are evaluated using hijing simulation with and without a flow afterburner .",
    "the nonflow effects in hijing are found to be largely statistical in nature , which is consistent with them being associated with independent emitters each containing a finite number of particles . the power spectrum for nonflow",
    "are found to decrease rapidly with @xmath79 and approach a purely statistical limit given by @xmath103 where @xmath65 is the number of particles used in the event . the majority of these nonflow effects are included in the data - driven response function and hence are removed in the unfolding procedure .",
    "the probability distribution of the residual nonflow , attributed partially to the away - side jets , is extracted for @xmath12 and found to be largely gaussian .",
    "the influence of these residual nonflow effects are found to be significant in the tails of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 distributions and for the peripheral collisions .",
    "however this influence can be absorbed in to a simultaneous change , by a few percent , of the mean and the width of the @xmath0 distributions , such that the reduced shape is largely invariant ( up to 5 - 15% maximum deviations are observed for the reduced shape , depending on @xmath79 and centrality interval ) . thus the data - driven unfolding procedure used by the atlas collaboration is rather robust in removing the nonflow contributions and recovering the true long - range flow correlations .",
    "the unfolding technique is also applied to ampt transport model simulation which contains both the flow fluctuations and nonflow .",
    "the @xmath0 distributions are extracted in two @xmath5 ranges in the low @xmath5 region .",
    "when these distributions are rescaled to the same mean values , the adjusted shapes are found to be nearly the same , very similar to the observation of the atlas measurement .",
    "this finding is also similar to recent event - by - event hydrodynamics model calculations  @xcite .",
    "although we discussed the calculation of ebye harmonic coefficients @xmath20 and the bayesian unfolding in the context of studying flow and nonflow in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this method can also be used as a general tool to understand the azimuthal correlations in other high energy experiments such as proton - proton or proton - nucleus collisions , as well as for events selected with particular features , such as events with multiple jets or large missing @xmath104 .",
    "such studies are still in progress , nevertheless but we briefly describe the idea as follows .",
    "each collision produce a distribution of particles in azimuth with a per - particle @xmath20 spectrum calculated via eq .",
    "[ eq : flow ] .",
    "however this spectrum in a single event can not be used directly as it is dominated by the statistical `` noise '' due to the finite number of particles .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by calculating the distribution of @xmath20 from many events .",
    "each event class of interest can have its own set of @xmath20 distributions , one for each @xmath79 .",
    "the statistical noise for these distributions can then be estimated from the large @xmath79 limit ( in practice , @xmath105 typically is enough , see figure  [ fig : hia2 ] ) : @xmath106 this distribution can also be obtained by randomizing the @xmath6 angle of all tracks ( hence destroy all azimuthal correlations ) .",
    "this distribution gives a baseline distribution in the absence of any azimuthal correlation .",
    "the distribution of lower - order harmonics is a convolution of this `` noise '' distribution with a probability distribution for genuine correlation @xmath107 : @xmath108 where the @xmath109 is a per - particle measure of the correlation strength at angular scale @xmath84 .",
    "standard unfolding technique can then be used to solve for @xmath107 using the @xmath110 as the response function .",
    "the distributions of @xmath107 in principle should be sensitive to the nature of the azimuthal correlations of the underlying physics processes in each event class .    if one also wants to distinguish correlations that are long range in @xmath52 from those that are short - range , one should use the response function obtained from the two - subevent method ( i.e. squares in figure  [ fig : hia2 ] ) in the unfolding .",
    "this procedure could be employed to study the long - range correlations ( known as the `` ridge '' ) recently observed in high multiplicity proton - proton  @xcite and proton - lead  @xcite collisions at the lhc .",
