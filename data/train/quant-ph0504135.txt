    "in a very interesting paper aharonov et al @xcite proposed the idea of a quantum random walk . here a random walker is constrained to move left or right depending on the state of an auxiliary quantum mechanical system .",
    "one then examines the state of the random walker subject to the measurement of the state of the auxiliary system . as an interesting consequence of this",
    "quantum random walk , aharonov et al @xcite found that the walker s distribution could shift by an amount which could be larger than the width of the initial distribution .",
    "further the displacement could be much larger than the classical displacement .",
    "several proposals @xcite exist for realizations of the quantum random walk .",
    "for example aharonov et al gave a cavity qed model where the photon number distribution can get displaced .",
    "sanders et al @xcite considered a dispersive interaction in the cavity of the form @xmath1 and considered the random walk of the field on states on a circle .",
    "other interesting theoretical schemes for implementing quantum walks have been suggested in ion - traps @xcite and in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "knight et al @xcite further showed that an earlier experiment @xcite was a realization of quantum random walks .",
    "a scheme using linear optical elements has been recently implemented @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a method which yields precisely quantum random walk as proposed by aharonov et al .",
    "we use cavity qed however we drive the atoms by an external field .",
    "currently there is considerable progress in realizing a variety of high quality cavities and a variety of interactions and thus one is in a situation where proposals like the one presented here are likely to be implemented .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we present the details of our model and show the conditions under which such a model gives rise to an effective hamiltonian which we use in sec.iii to realize quantum random walk . in this section we also present the results for the wigner function for the state of the quantum walker .",
    "in sec.iv we show how the homodyne measurements of the field can be used to check the characteristics of the quantum random walk . in sec.v we incorporate the effects of decoherence due to the decay of the field in the cavity . in the appendix",
    "we discuss the state of the walker if no conditional measurements are made and establish relation to classical random walks .",
    "we consider a two level rydberg atom having its higher energy state @xmath2 and lower energy state @xmath3 , interacting with a single mode of the electromagnetic field in a cavity .",
    "the atom passes through the cavity and interacts resonantly with the field .",
    "further the atom is driven by a strong classical field .",
    "for simplicity we choose atomic transition frequency , the cavity frequency and the frequency of the driving field to be same .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system in the interaction picture is written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the coupling constants of the interaction of the atom with the cavity field and with the deriving field .",
    "we have chosen @xmath5 as real and @xmath6 as complex .",
    "the annihilation ( creation ) operator for the field in the cavity is @xmath7 and @xmath8 are atomic spin operators .",
    "the last term in eq.([ham ] ) is the interaction with the external field .",
    "we further rewrite the above hamiltonian in a picture in which the interaction with the external field has already been diagonalized .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 is transformed atomic state in new picture from old atomic state @xmath11 .",
    "the hamiltonian in this picture is @xmath12 the atomic spin operators @xmath13 transform as @xmath14 using eqs.([s+ ] ) and ( [ s- ] ) , eq.([newh ] ) becomes @xmath15 we note that the hamiltonians of the above form have been previously used to treat the inhibition of the spontaneous emission @xcite and for the production of schrodinger cat states @xcite .",
    "we assume that the atom is driven strongly so that @xmath16 is large and hence we drop rapidly oscillating terms from eq.([hbar ] ) _ i.e. _ @xmath17 . then eq.([hbar ] ) reduces to @xmath18 we choose @xmath19 , in general , this can also be done by adjusting phases with atomic operators .",
    "then the eq.([newhbar ] ) takes the form @xmath20 note the appearance of the well known displacement @xmath21 in the eq.([neth ] ) .",
    "in particular we have the momentum operator ( out of phase quadrature for the field ) .",
    "further it should also be noted that @xmath22 as defined by eq.([h ] ) commutes with @xmath23 . in the original interaction picture the hamiltonian for our model will be @xmath24 in the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) field displacement operator appears with atomic operator , which can produce displacement in field state depending on the atomic state .",
    "for the position of the quantum random walker , assuming initial wave packet as gaussian @xmath57 $ ] for @xmath49 , step size @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60.,width=288,height=288 ]     of the state of the random walker , after number of steps ( a ) @xmath61 ( b ) @xmath62 , using same parameters as in fig.[fig1].,width=480,height=576 ]    for visualizing quantum interferences we plot the wigner function of the random walker in fig.[fig2 ] . the wigner distribution for any state @xmath63 can be obtained by using the definition @xcite , @xmath64 in the fig.[fig2](a ) the field is in its initial coherent state and the wigner function is perfect gaussian . as the field",
    "is displaced by random steps , by passing atoms through the cavity , quantum interference effects start deforming the shape of the wigner function from the gaussian .",
    "after few steps the wigner function is squeezed in @xmath48 quadrature and gets displaced by an arbitrary distance in @xmath48 . in fig.[fig2](b ) , ( see also fig.[fig4](a ) ) , we have shown the wigner function after @xmath65 random steps for initial gaussian wave packet .",
    "the squeezing is also clear from the fig.[fig1 ] which shows the narrowing of the distribution @xmath53 .",
    "it is clear that the displacement in the position of random walker comes as a result of quantum interference which is consequence of quantum coherence between the states generated in random steps .",
    "we next discuss how we can probe the quantum state of the random walker .",
    "we propose homodyne techniques @xcite for measuring the state of the random walker .",
    "such homodyne measurement can be performed by mixing an external resonant coherent field to the cavity and then probing the resultant cavity field by passing a test atom through the cavity . in the previous section ,",
    "we have shown how the cavity field is displaced backward or forward in a random step by passing single atom through the cavity .",
    "the state of the field in the cavity after such @xmath36 steps can be monitored by homodyne measurements which can be implemented in the same experimental set up . after displacing the field inside the cavity by @xmath36 random steps , by passing @xmath36 atoms ,",
    "a resonant external coherent field @xmath66 is injected into the cavity . after adding the external field ,",
    "the state of the resultant field in the cavity is @xmath67 now we bring a similar atom in its lower energy state @xmath3 to probe the cavity field .",
    "the probability of detecting the probe atom in its lower state @xmath3 after crossing the cavity in time @xmath68 is @xmath69 the interaction time @xmath68 for the probe atom is selected such that if there are photons in the cavity it leaves the cavity in its higher energy state @xmath2 with larger probability . if we choose the external field @xmath66 such that @xmath70 , the probe atom will leave the cavity in its ground state with larger probability when the value of @xmath71 will be opposite and equal to the displacement of the random walker from the initial position @xmath72 .",
    "thus the probability of the probe atom leaving the cavity in its lower state @xmath3 would , as a function of @xmath71 , have peak corresponding to the positions of the random walker after @xmath36 steps . in fig.[fig3 ] , we plot the probability of detecting the probe atom in its lower state with @xmath71 .",
    "the solid line curve is result of homodyne measurement of the position of the random walker corresponding to its initial state .",
    "the dashed line curve is corresponding to the homodyne measurement after @xmath65 steps using the same parameter as in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "clearly the homodyne measurement yields the state of the quantum walker ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus the homodyne measurement can be an elegant way for monitoring the position of the random walker in our model of realizing quantum random walks .     for the state of the quantum random walker after number of steps",
    "@xmath61 ( solid line ) and @xmath62 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the parameters used are same as in fig.[fig1 ] and the interaction time for the probe atom is selected such that @xmath73.,width=288 ]    , ( b ) for @xmath74 , ( c ) for @xmath75 , ( d ) for @xmath76 , other parameters are same as fig.[fig2 ] ( b).,width=480,height=480 ]",
    "quantum random walks are different from the classical random walks in the sense of quantum interferences which may lead much larger displacements in the position of quantum random walker than the classically possible maximum displacements .",
    "these quantum interferences are the consequences of coherence in the system .",
    "clearly we need the coherence to live for a long time and thus it is important to study the effects of the decoherence of the system . in this section",
    "we study the decoherence of the state of the random walker due to damping in the cavity .",
    "this can be done using the master equation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is cavity field decay parameter and we carry analysis in the absence of thermal photons . for initial state ( [ final ] ) we find the density matrix after time @xmath27    @xmath79    where @xmath80 . in the limit",
    "@xmath81 the eq.([deco ] ) simplifies to @xmath82 thus the coherence of the state decays on the time scales @xmath83 . in fig.[fig4 ] we show the decoherence effects due to the cavity damping in the state of the quantum random walker in terms of wigner function .",
    "as the time progresses from ( a ) to ( d ) the decoherence reduces the quantum interference effects and the state of the random walker decays to its initial state . in fig.[fig4](a )",
    "the wigner function for the state of the random walker after @xmath65 steps using the parameters of fig.[fig2](b ) is plotted which is squeezed in @xmath48 quadrature and centered at @xmath84 . as a result of decoherence due to cavity damping the quantum interferences start decaying and the wigner function changes to the perfect gaussian shape , fig.[fig4](c ) centered at @xmath85 . now the field inside the cavity is almost in coherent state and decays with the cavity damping rate .",
    "further the life time for the state of the quantum random walker is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is life time for field in the cavity .",
    "in conclusion we have shown a simple possible realization of quantum random walks using cavity qed .",
    "we have proposed homodyne detection for monitoring the position of the random walker .",
    "we have also discussed the decoherence effects and the time scales at which quantum nature of random walks survives . as a result of new emerging technologies various improved cavities are feasible these days @xcite , which makes our proposal much interesting and realistic .",
    "such realization of quantum random walks may be useful for implementing various algorithms @xcite based on quantum random walks .",
    "finally it should be noted that the generalizations of the present work to more than one dimensions are possible .",
    "in this appendix we would like to connect the result ( [ app ] ) explicitly to the case of classical random walk . for this purpose",
    "we find the reduced state of the field from ( [ app ] ) .",
    "we also set @xmath88 , then the reduced state of the field @xmath89 is @xmath90 clearly the state of the field after the passage of @xmath36 atoms would be @xmath91 which is reminiscent of the result for classical random walk in the sense that the weight factor of the state @xmath92 is same as the probability of finding the walker at the site @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "it should however be borne in mind that the coherent states @xmath94 and @xmath95 are not orthogonal for @xmath96 .",
