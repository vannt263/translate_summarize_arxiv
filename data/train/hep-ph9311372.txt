    "<S> while there is a single higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) , the minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) has five of them  three neutral @xmath14 and two charged @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenological interest here has concentrated largely on the neutral sector@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as regards @xmath16 , it is recognized that top decay would provide viable signals at hadron colliders if @xmath17 . on the other hand , the region @xmath18 is favored by constraints from @xmath19 data@xcite , if there are no light charginos@xcite ; </S>",
    "<S> this region has been considered problematical , since the principal signal @xmath20 would suffer from large qcd backgrounds at a hadron collider@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the possibility of efficient @xmath3-tagging could transform this situation by discriminating against the background , as in the case of neutral higgs signals in the intermediate mass region@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present letter is devoted to a quantitative exploration of this possibility ; our results apply to two - higgs - doublet models in general , though we shall refer to particular features of the mssm from time to time . </S>",
    "<S> some preliminary results from a similar study by gunion@xcite have recently appeared ; these are complementary to the present work , since his methods of calculation and analysis differ somewhat from ours . </S>",
    "<S> we show below that viable signals may indeed be expected , over a limited but interesting range of @xmath16 mass and coupling parameter space , in the proposed large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite with @xmath1 collisions at cm energy @xmath21  tev .    in two - higgs - doublet models , where it is usually assumed that up - type and </S>",
    "<S> down - type quarks get masses from different vevs , the main @xmath16 interactions with quarks are given by @xmath22 b + \\rm h.c . \\;,\\ ] ] neglecting terms suppressed by small quark masses or small km matrix elements @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the usual ratio of vevs . </S>",
    "<S> the principal hadroproduction and decay mechanisms for a heavy charged higgs boson are therefore @xmath25 plus the corresponding charge - conjugate channel . </S>",
    "<S> ( in the mssm , an alternative decay mode to the same final state , @xmath26 , is suppressed in the mass range @xmath18 of present interest@xcite ) . as a tag for top production </S>",
    "<S> , we shall assume that one of the @xmath27-bosons decays leptonically @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 ) . to enhance the event rate and facilitate event reconstruction </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the other @xmath27-boson decays hadronically @xmath30 , with invariant mass @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we consider the signal @xmath32 where all five quarks give separate jets and the lepton is isolated . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that all three @xmath3-jets are tagged by a vertex detector ; tagging via semileptonic @xmath3-decays is less desirable , since the additional missing neutrinos blur the kinematics , but on the other hand it distinguishes @xmath3 from @xmath33 and removes some ambiguity in the event reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> this final state implies a spectator @xmath3-quark in one of the beams ; however , we expect that this spectator will be produced at small angle and will not appear in the acceptance region described below . </S>",
    "<S> our approach differs here from gunion@xcite who calculates the subprocess @xmath34 where the spectator is explicit .    </S>",
    "<S> the principal background sub - processes are qcd production @xmath35 and fake backgrounds from @xmath36 where the @xmath37 jet or one of the @xmath38 jets is mistakenly tagged ; @xmath39 decays are understood . </S>",
    "<S> there is an electroweak contribution to eq.([qcdprod ] ) from @xmath16 exchange in the @xmath40-channel , but this is much smaller than the signal ( suppressed by additional propagators ) and we henceforth neglect it . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a possible background from intermediate - mass neutral higgs boson production and decay : @xmath41 where one of the final @xmath3-quarks does not give a separate jet within acceptance cuts . in the mssm , </S>",
    "<S> this neutral boson could be @xmath42 or @xmath43 or @xmath44 ; with our present heavy @xmath16 scenario , we would then have @xmath43 and @xmath44 equally heavy @xmath45 with their @xmath46 contributions suppressed by competing channels @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) while @xmath42 couplings are approximately those of the sm . </S>",
    "<S> however , the total @xmath49 production @xcite is then an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath5 production via eq.([qcdprod ] ) , so we henceforth neglect the channel of eq.([i - m h^0 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is already known@xcite that these backgrounds are potentially much larger than the signal . however , we shall show that the background of eq.([qcdprod ] ) can be reduced to the same order as the signal ( in favorable cases ) by a choice of kinematic cuts , while the fake background eq.([fake ] ) is also reduced to a comparable level by the additional @xmath3-tagging requirement . we here choose the following acceptance cuts on the 3 tagged plus 2 untagged jets ( collectively labelled @xmath50 ) , the lepton @xmath51 and missing transverse momentum @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote transverse momentum and pseudorapidity . </S>",
    "<S> we also require minimum separations @xmath56^{1/2}$ ] between the jets and lepton , @xmath57 to simulate some effects of jet - finding and lepton isolation criteria . </S>",
    "<S> we take account of possible invisible neutrino energy in @xmath58 decays by monte carlo modelling , and thereafter regard all partons as jets if they pass the above cuts . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate calorimeter resolution by a gaussian smearing of @xmath54 , with @xmath59 for jets and @xmath60 for leptons ( taking the same resolution for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for simplicity ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath52 is evaluated from the vector sum of lepton and jet momenta , after resolution smearing . </S>",
    "<S> we require the invariant mass of the two untagged jets to be consistent with @xmath63 : @xmath64 we assume branching fractions @xmath65 , and tagging efficiencies @xmath66 for individual @xmath3-jets , @xmath7-jets and gluon ( or light quark ) jets respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate production rates using the mrsd@xmath67 parton distributions@xcite at scale @xmath68 for both the signal and the backgrounds , assuming @xmath69  gev throughout . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath3-quark distribution is inferred via qcd evolution from descriptions of deep inelastic scattering data , there is room for controversy here ; however , both the signal and the  true \" background of eq.([qcdprod ] ) depend on the same input @xmath3-distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the net signal and background cross sections , with these cuts and branching / tagging factors , are illustrated in fig .  1 for @xmath1 collisions at @xmath21  tev .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  1 , which does not include tag - factors , shows that the charged - higgs signal has an appreciable size for some ranges of the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 dependence is given by a factor @xmath71 , with a minimum at @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the neighbourhood of this minimum is unpromising for @xmath16 detection , but many @xmath73@xmath74 models suggest that @xmath9 lies near @xmath75 or alternatively is very large@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tagging reduces the major @xmath76 and @xmath77 backgrounds by a factor @xmath78 relative to the signal , making them roughly comparable for favourable @xmath9 . to improve the signal / background ratio further and to estimate the mass @xmath70 , we propose the following strategy for event reconstructions .    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> reconstruct the missing neutrino momentum , by equating @xmath79 and fixing the longitudinal component @xmath80 by the invariant mass constraint @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter gives two solutions in general ; if they are complex we discard the imaginary parts and the solutions coalesce . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the sign @xmath82 of this @xmath27 ( and hence by inference the other @xmath27 too ) is determined by the sign of the lepton charge . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   there are now 6 ways in which two of the @xmath3-jets can be paired with the two @xmath27 s to form top candidates ( unless some of the @xmath3-jets are also lepton - tagged and thus have known signs ) . </S>",
    "<S> together with the two - fold ambiguity from  ( a ) , this gives 12 candidate reconstructions , in each of which there are two top mass values @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> we select the assignment with best fit to the top mass ( that will be known ) , determined by minimizing @xmath84 subject to the requirements @xmath85  gev and @xmath86  gev . if these requirements can not be met , we reject the event as unreconstructable . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   in the selected best - fit assignment above </S>",
    "<S> , there are 2 ways in which the remaining @xmath3-jet can be paired with one of the top candidates , so we have 2 candidate values for the reconstructed charged - higgs mass @xmath87 . unless the charge of the @xmath3-jet can be identified , there is no way to choose between them ( unless the @xmath3-jet is also lepton - tagged ) , so we retain both values ; thus even the signal events contain an irreducible combinatorial background </S>",
    "<S> . however , the correct pairings will give a peak in the @xmath88 distribution while the incorrect pairings and background events will be more broadly distributed .    </S>",
    "<S> this strategy is more ambitious than that of ref.@xcite , where a @xmath3-jet is combined only with a reconstructed @xmath89 hadronic system .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  2 compares the signal and background contributions to the @xmath90 distributions , for @xmath91  gev with either @xmath92 or @xmath93 ; there are two possible values and hence two counts per event in this graph . </S>",
    "<S> for the most favourable of the cases illustrated , namely @xmath94  gev with @xmath93 , the signal integrated over the range @xmath95  gev is 5 counts over a total background of 4 counts for each fb@xmath96 of luminosity . with @xmath97 of luminosity ( one years running at design luminosity @xmath98 ) </S>",
    "<S> this signal would be very significant . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath99 increases , both the signal and background fall at comparable rates ; for @xmath100  gev , the signal in a 60  gev bin is @xmath101 over a background of @xmath102  counts / fb@xmath96 that would still be very significant with @xmath97 luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> if we take @xmath103 instead , the background remains essentially the same while all the signals drop by a factor 2.8(11 ) ; hence the regions @xmath104 and @xmath105 are very promising while the region @xmath106 is problematical . </S>",
    "<S> thus far we have assumed @xmath69  gev ; for @xmath107  gev instead , the @xmath108 signals shown here increase by about @xmath109 ( except near threshold @xmath110 ) while the net background falls by about @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> lastly we remark that the assumed cuts above are rather stringent , reducing the higgs signal by factors of order 1030 depending on @xmath8 , and the tagging efficiencies may prove to be better than we have assumed here@xcite ; in these respects our event rates may be viewed as conservative .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the outlook is promising . with our assumed tagging efficiencies and cuts , significant @xmath20 charged - higgs signals </S>",
    "<S> would be detectable for a limited but interesting range of the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    </S>",
