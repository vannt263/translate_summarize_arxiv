    "an advantage of this approach is that we generate new solutions to the einstein - maxwell system which contain uncharged solutions found previously : maharaj and leach @xcite , tikekar @xcite , durgapal and bannerji @xcite and john and maharaj @xcite , amongst others .",
    "we first express the einstein - maxwell system of equations for static spherically symmetric line element as an equivalent system using the durgapal and bannerji @xcite transformation in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
