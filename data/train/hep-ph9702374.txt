    "heavy baryons such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 containing one heavy quark can be successfully described by the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , especially in leading order of the @xmath0-expansion , i.e.  in the limit of heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) ( for a review on hqet see  @xcite , for details on hqs see  @xcite ) . for each of the ground - state baryons",
    "there are two independent current components , e.g. @xmath6q^k{\\varepsilon}_{ijk}\\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad j_{\\lambda2}=[q^{it}c\\tau\\gamma_5\\gamma_0q^j]q^k{\\varepsilon}_{ijk},\\ ] ] while the general structure of heavy baryon currents has the form @xmath7\\gamma'q^k{\\varepsilon}_{ijk},\\ ] ] where the index @xmath8 means transposition , @xmath9 is the charge conjugation matrix , @xmath10 is a matrix in flavour space , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are colour indices .",
    "the effective static field of the heavy quark is denoted by @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the dirac structures of the different current parts .    in fig .",
    "1 are shown some examples of diagrams up to two - loop order which we calculated .",
    "the one- and two - loop diagrams can be grouped in three different classes , namely the heavy diquark system ( diagrams ( b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) , ( f ) and ( g ) ) , the light diquark system ( diagrams ( d ) and ( h ) ) and the irreducible vertex contribution ( diagrams ( i ) and ( j ) ) .",
    "the first two can be handled in a manner similar to the meson case , and actually it turns out that the replacement @xmath17 leads from the diquark to the meson quark - antiquark case ( and not vice - versa ) .",
    "so the mesonic case can be seen as a byproduct of our calculations .",
    "the calculation of all these diagrams can be executed by nearly the same procedure .",
    "the procedure is strictly algorithmic , so that the calculations could be automatized and programmed in mathematica . in the following",
    "i want to emphasize the main steps of this calculation , and i want to do this for the first two - loop heavy diquark diagram which is displayed in fig .  2 ( the arrows on the gluon lines only indicate the momentum flow ) .      before starting the main calculation , the colour structure can be treated .",
    "in general it contains the gell - mann matrices , the epsilon tensor for resons of colourless , and the colour couplings of the gluons , which consists of a @xmath18 for a single gluon and a factor @xmath19 for a three - gluon vertex . in our case",
    "we get @xmath20 @xmath21 is the number of colours , and the results can be expressed by the constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which denotes the number of flavours .      without the colour structure",
    "we get @xmath27 the four - momentum of the heavy quark is given by @xmath28 , and we have @xmath29 .",
    "this vertex correction can be split up into a _",
    "dirac structure @xmath30 _ , a _ momentum structure @xmath31 _ and a _",
    "scalar integral _ ( also called _",
    "`` race integral '' _ ) @xmath32      with the help of the recursion formulas developed in  @xcite it is possible to reduce each two - loop function @xmath33 of the hqet and each two - loop function @xmath34 of the massless qcd to corresponding one - loop functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which dissolve into euler s gamma functions .",
    "the recursion formulas are one of the main parts of the developed program package , and we would like to thank david broadhurst for providing us with a reduce implementation of these formulas .      by extracting the dirac structure ,",
    "the remaining integral receives corresponding lorentz indices .",
    "it can be evaluated covariantly , in this case into @xmath37 the parts @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be obtained by contracting the integral with the corresponding dual tensors .",
    "this contraction pairs the momentum structure to the scalar products @xmath40 the scalar products `` operate '' on the entries of the two - loop function ( e.g. , @xmath41 decreases the first entry by one unit ) , and can therefore be identified with operators on the different entries of the two - loop functions .",
    "the covariant evaluation in combination with the dirac structure gives @xmath42 for the heavy diquark system the matrix @xmath15 will always remain on the edge of the structure .",
    "in contrast to this , for the light diquark system the dirac structure can be reduced to one of the main structures @xmath43",
    "the result of the perturbation series to second order for the different ground - state hadron currents can be written in quite a compact form , if we make some slight assumption for @xmath15 . in this case , we can split off a scalar valued _ vertex function @xmath44_.      if @xmath15 is totally antisymmetrized , @xmath47},\\ldots\\}$ ] , we get @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the space - time dimension , @xmath45 the number of dirac matrices and @xmath46 denotes the number of @xmath50 s in @xmath15 , i.e.  being @xmath51 for an even and @xmath52 for an odd number of @xmath50 s",
    ". problems will emerge from the appearence of @xmath1 , but i will postpone the discussion of this to the end of the talk .      without looking at the parts from different classes of diagrams , the vertex function for the heavy baryon current in its generalized form",
    "is given by @xmath53 this expression can be evaluated in powers of @xmath54 with @xmath55 and shows singularities which can be canceled by means of the minimal subtraction scheme ( ms ) .",
    "indeed , the evaluation in @xmath56 is rather more simple .",
    "this evaluation allows for the application of the modified minimal subtraction scheme ( @xmath57 ) . by using a general gauge parameter @xmath58",
    "( @xmath59 means feynman gauge ) for the one - loop contributions , we get @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 is omitted , because it has no significance for the following calculations .",
    "the vertex function still contains uv - singularities . it is a bare quantity , from now on denoted by @xmath63 ,",
    "which has to be renormalized .",
    "this renormalization is done with the help of a renormalization factor .",
    "dimensional regularization is used from the beginning , what remains is the subtraction with the aid of the modified minimal subtraction scheme , as indicated above . in the following",
    "we simplify the notation by using the term @xmath64 instead of @xmath65 , but we keep in mind that we have used the @xmath57-scheme",
    ".      the divergencies of @xmath63 will be absorbed by the renormalization factor @xmath66 .",
    "we have to state therefore that @xmath67 is a finite quantity . by expanding the renormalization factor @xmath66 in a double series @xmath68 a comparison of the coefficients",
    "up to second order gives @xmath69      up to now we have left out the renormalization of the coupling constant  @xmath70 and the gauge parameter  @xmath58 , @xmath71 looking at terms up to second order in perturbation theory , we only need to correct the terms of first order . in this way we get corrections for the coefficient @xmath72 of the renormalization factor @xmath66 , namely @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the gauge dependent part of @xmath75 .",
    "the renormalized coupling is an object in @xmath49 space - time dimensions .",
    "therefore , it gets a double dependence in the renormalization scale  @xmath76 , @xmath77 the beta - function for the coupling and the gauge , two essential tools for the renormalization group equation , can then be calculated as @xmath78 this can be used for the calculation of the anomalous dimension @xmath79 , @xmath80 by evaluating the finite quantities @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath79 in a perturbation series , starting at first order , the comparison of the coefficients leads to a determining equation for the coefficients of the anomalous dimension , @xmath83 and on the other hand to a class of consistency checks , which can be revolved to the coefficients of the perturbation series , e.g. @xmath84 where @xmath85 again denotes the gauge dependent part of @xmath86 . for the derivation we should note that @xmath87",
    "to renormalize the current , we also have to include the renormalization of the outer legs , because we have @xmath88\\gamma'q^0=z_qz_q^{1/2}z_vj = z_jj\\quad    \\rightarrow\\quad\\gamma_j=2\\gamma_q+\\gamma_q+\\gamma_v.\\ ] ] by taking this into account  @xcite , to first order we get @xmath89 for the values @xmath90 and @xmath91 of @xmath92 , this expression is gauge independent .",
    "so we can use these values , @xmath93 and @xmath25 and restrict ourselves to the feynman gauge .          for the anomalous dimension of different baryon currents and different schemes we get @xmath94 the `` naive non - abelianization '' recipe ,",
    "the estimate of the total result by calculating the quark - loop diagram and replacing @xmath26 by @xmath95 , does work for most of the cases with an accuracy of 15 to 30% . only in the case of the current @xmath96",
    "it seems to fail .",
    "note , however , that in this case the anomalous dimension is one order of magnitude smaller than in all other cases .",
    "the difference of the anomalous dimension for the two different @xmath1-schemes turns out to be a correction of second order which is proportional to the coefficient @xmath97 of the beta - function of the coupling .",
    "so we might think about connecting the already renormalized currents by some finite renormalization factor  @xcite , namely @xmath98 so we get @xmath99 indeed , the ansatz @xmath100 leads to @xmath101 with @xmath102 o_{\\gamma_5\\gamma_i\\gamma_j}\\ = \\",
    "o_{\\gamma_5\\gamma_i\\gamma_0}&=&0,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and therefore @xmath103 the vertex structures @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are included for the sake of completeness , although they are not needed for the baryonic @xmath107-wave states discussed in this talk .",
    "the meson case , already treated by trueman and larin  @xcite , can again be obtained by the replacement @xmath17 .",
