    "one - particle quantum interference is one of the most important effects that illustrates the superposition principle and thus the major difference between quantum and classical physics.@xcite in this paper we propose a simple model based on the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "our hope is to provide a simple example of quantum superposition and quantum interference .",
    "we consider a modification of the gedanken experiment by scully , englert , and walther,@xcite which we reduce to probably the simplest setup that can expose the physics in a concise way .",
    "reference   is a highly influential paper and several previous publications discuss and present the experiment in a didactical way.@xcite the emphasis in these publications ranges from practical realizations of a mach - zehnder interferometer to a thorough discussion of the subtleties of quantum physics .    in this paper",
    "we show that the fundamental aspects of the experiment can be captured by a minimal model that requires knowledge only of two - level systems and is based on the mach - zehnder interferometer . for maximum clarity",
    "we avoid an extended discussion of experimental and further theoretical aspects , for which we refer to refs .  .",
    "we also focus on a mach - zehnder interferometer with only two detectors at the exit instead of the screen used in young s two - slit experiment , which corresponds to a continuum of detectors .",
    "the mach - zehnder interferometer allows us to model the step by step evolution of the state of a quantum particle in the interferometer .",
    "we briefly summarize the experiment proposed in ref .",
    "in which a mechanism is proposed to detect the path ( `` which - way detection '' ) of a particle passing through a young interferometer ( see fig .  [ ww1 ] ) .",
    "an atom is emitted by a source @xmath0 , passes through two slits , and is detected on a screen @xmath1 . directly after leaving the source , the atom is brought into an excited state by a laser .",
    "two cavities @xmath2 and @xmath3 are placed in front of the slits of the young interferometer .",
    "when passing through the cavities the atom emits a photon and relaxes to its ground state . to know which path",
    "was taken by the atom it is sufficient to see whether the photon is in @xmath2 or @xmath3 . important for this experiment",
    "is that the trajectory of the atom through the slits remains otherwise unperturbed .",
    "due to the emission of the photon in cavity @xmath2 or @xmath3 the usual interference pattern at the screen @xmath0 is destroyed .",
    "the interference disappears even without explicit detection of the photon .",
    "it is sufficient to transfer the potential which - way information to the photon state .",
    "however , by allowing the photon emitted in @xmath2 or @xmath3 to be reabsorbed by an auxiliary atom , a _ quantum eraser _ , the information of the atom s path can be erased , and the interference pattern at the screen can be restored .",
    "this result was confirmed experimentally by drr , nonn , and rempe@xcite using a modified mach - zehnder interferometer ( see also refs .   and ) .    ]",
    "we consider the mach - zehnder interferometer shown in fig .",
    "it consists of a source @xmath0 , which emits particles into the interferometer along the @xmath4 direction such that at any given time , a maximum of a single particle is in the interferometer .",
    "( see ref .   for a discussion of the first experiment realizing single - particle interference . )",
    "the particles first hit beam splitter _",
    "_ bs__@xmath5 through which they are transmitted to path @xmath6 or deflected to path @xmath7 . two mirrors @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 let these paths cross again at a second beam splitter _ _ bs__@xmath10 .",

    "@xmath7 have the same length , and therefore quantum interference leads to detection probability equal to 1 in @xmath11 and 0 in @xmath12 , in contrast to the classical expectation of equal probabilities of @xmath14 for both detectors.[mz1 ] ]    an explanation of the mach - zehnder interferometer is given in ref .  .",
    "for completeness and to establish the notation we summarize the main physics of the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the state inside the interferometer can be modeled as a two - level system , for instance , by associating the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the particle at any time corresponding to its direction of propagation inside the interferometer ( see fig .  [ mz1 ] ) .",
    "if both paths @xmath6 and @xmath7 have the same length , we can neglect the phase of the particle on the trajectories between the beam splitters and mirrors .",
    "the effect of the interferometer on the particle state is then given by the sequence of unitary transformations @xmath17 .",
    "a symmetric and equilibrated beam splitter is described by the unitary transformation@xcite @xmath18 while the combination of the mirrors @xmath8 and @xmath9 acts as @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we combine these transformation and see that the interferometer acts as @xmath21 at the exit of the mach - zehnder interferometer the detector @xmath11 measures the component @xmath15 of the outgoing state @xmath22 , and @xmath12 , the component @xmath16 with the probabilities    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the projectors onto @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "particles are injected from the source along the @xmath4 direction , that is , in state @xmath15 . from eq .",
    "it therefore follows that the probability of measuring the particle in detector @xmath11 is @xmath26 , and the probability of measuring it in detector @xmath12 is @xmath27 .",
    "this result is in contrast to the expected classical result , which is @xmath28 .",
    "this effect is known as _",
    "one - particle quantum interference _ and is one of the typical non - classical and counterintuitive effects of the quantum physics.@xcite increasing the length of one of the paths @xmath6 or @xmath7 leads to an additional phase difference of the states before _ _",

    "the quantum interference effect is destroyed if we put additional ( nondestructive ) detectors @xmath31 on path @xmath6 and @xmath32 on path @xmath7 ( see fig .  [ wwmz ] ) to detect which path was chosen by the particle .",
    "a detection by @xmath31 projects the particle onto the state @xmath15 and tells us that path @xmath6 was taken .",
    "a detection by @xmath32 projects onto @xmath16 and tells us that path @xmath7 was taken .",
    "hence the state at the exit of the interferometer is fully determined by the action of the beam splitter _ _ bs__@xmath10 on the incoming state from either path @xmath6 or path @xmath7 .",
    "the final beam splitting leads to the probabilities @xmath33 and @xmath34 , equivalent to the classical result and independent of the result detected by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the quantum interference disappears , showing that the concepts of `` quantum interference '' and `` knowledge of the path '' are complementary .",
    "note that the interference disappears as soon as the information on the path is stored in the system state .",
    "it is not a `` uncontrolled '' perturbation of the state of the quantum particle that destroys the interference .     and",
    "@xmath32 are placed on the paths @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the entanglement of the particle with @xmath31 and @xmath32 provides information on which path was taken by it .",
    "this information destroys the quantum interference and results in detection probabilities equal to 1/2 in @xmath11 and @xmath12 corresponding to the classical result.[wwmz ] ]",
    "a remarkable property of quantum physics is that the interference vanishes by the mere presence of the detectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 , even if the result of the measurement is not classically read out ( which would correspond to a projection on the path taken @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) .",
    "this property can be illustrated by a simple extension of the mach - zehnder interferometer , which also lets us show that a detection takes place by _ entanglement _ between the particle and the detector .",
    "we call this model a _ which - way entangler_. we start from the which - way detector shown in fig .",
    "in addition , we now assume that the particle is emitted into the interferometer in an excited state @xmath37 .",
    "the detection by detectors @xmath31 or @xmath32 relaxes the particle into its ground state @xmath38 by emission of a photon .",
    "we denote the photon state by @xmath39 or @xmath40 , determined by which detector received the photon , and use the notation @xmath41 for the absence of any photon .",

    "once the photon is emitted , it becomes _ entangled _ with the quantum particle state , which means that we can no longer write the state as a simple product @xmath48 , as is clearly seen with @xmath49 in eq .  .",
    "we now show that the which - way information can be erased in a simple way , which restores the quantum interference at the output of the mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "consider the mach - zehnder interferometer , modified in the following way .",
    "we assume that the photon after emission in one of the two @xmath50 detectors travels to an auxiliary atom @xmath51 , the _ quantum eraser _ , where it can be absorbed ( see fig .  [ wwmz1 ] ) . to activate the quantum eraser ,",
    "the observer has to open a channel @xmath52 connecting detectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 to atom @xmath51 .",
    "this opening can be done at any time after the emission of the photons , even when the quantum particle has left the mach - zehnder interferometer.@xcite     or @xmath32 .",
    "if channel @xmath52 is open , the photon can be absorbed , with some probability , by an auxiliary atom @xmath53 , the quantum eraser .",
    "the absorption erases the entanglement with the detectors and restores the quantum interference at the exit of the interferometer.[wwmz1 ] ]    let @xmath54 be the initial ( ground ) state of the quantum eraser @xmath53 and let @xmath55 be its excited state .",
    "we consider the evolution of the system `` atom + photon + quantum eraser . '' if the channel @xmath52 is closed , then the state just before the final detection is identical to eq .   with the additional state @xmath54 of @xmath51 ,    @xmath56      \\otimes      { |g\\rangle } \\otimes { |\\gamma\\rangle},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and",
    "we obtain the same probabilities @xmath14 at the final detectors as in sec .",
    "in contrast , if channel @xmath52 is open , the photon travels from the detectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 to the eraser @xmath57 where with some probability it can be absorbed by exciting the quantum eraser .",
    "we stress that the absorption of the photon is probabilistic and depends on the precise superposition of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 components of the photon state at @xmath57 and on the cross - section of the absorption process . an absorption ( erasure ) that occurs with certainty",
    "would be a nonunitary transformation which is forbidden by quantum physics and would allow for paradoxes such as superluminous transmission of information , that is , a violation of the no - signalling - theorem.@xcite    therefore the quantum erasure occurs only for some outcomes of the interference experiments . for those cases where",
    "the photon is absorbed by @xmath57 , the system state is projected onto @xmath58 this state is identical ( for the injected particle ) to the usual action of the mach - zehnder interferometer expressed by eq .  , and therefore the single - particle interference at the detectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 is restored .",
    "however , the probabilities @xmath29 and @xmath30 are now replaced by the conditional probabilities @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which involve the preselection of the measurements to only those cases where the photon has actually been absorbed by the quantum eraser.@xcite as a result we obtain    @xmath61    we see that the erasure of the which - path information by the absorption of the photon by the quantum eraser completely restores the original quantum interference .",
    "we have presented a simple model that requires knowledge only of two - level systems . nonetheless , it allows us to explain interesting effects about one - particle quantum interference : quantum interference appears when a particle can take different indistinguishable paths to arrive at a detector .",
    "the knowledge of which path was taken is obtained by entanglement between the quantum particle and a detector on the path .",
    "the loss of the one - particle quantum interference is an illustration that this entanglement changes the state of the particle .",
    "the interference can be restored by using the quantum eraser , which disentangles the particle and detector states , and thus also erases any which - way information .",
    "note that a noisy environment acts in a similar way as the which - path detector and destroys the quantum interference by getting entangled through interaction with the particle .",
    "however , this effect is generally uncontrolled and not reversible by a quantum eraser , and the result is a purely classically operating mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the complementarity between `` quantum interference '' and `` knowledge of the path '' in this simple model is manifestly evident : `` quantum interference '' corresponds to a factorized ( product ) state , `` knowledge of the path '' to an entangled state .",
