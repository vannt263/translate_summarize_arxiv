    "recently , intriguing properties of sine - square deformation ( ssd ) for 1 + 1-dimensional quantum many - body systems have been revealed by a series of intensive theoretical researches.@xcite the ssd was originally introduced as a spatial deformation of interaction couplings with the sine - square function for 1 + 1d quantum lattice models.@xcite several numerical studies clarified that critical ground states of ssd systems with the open - boundary are identical to those of the uniform systems with the periodic boundary within numerical accuracy .",
    "later , this correspondence of the ground states between the uniform and ssd systems was proved for some exactly solved models which can be reduced to free fermionic models.@xcite in ref.@xcite , an interesting connection of the ssd to supersymmetric quantum mechanics is pointed out for a nonrelativistic free fermion system in the continuous space .",
    "moreover , the correspondence of the open and periodic boundary systems under the ssd has been successfully applied to numerical estimation of bulk quantities via finite - size systems@xcite .",
    "these scalabilities of the ssd researches suggest that there exists rich physics behind the ssd .",
    "the ssd of the two - dimensional conformal field theory ( cft)@xcite was firstly investigated by katsura , where the operator @xmath0 is regarded as a hamiltonian of the ssd system.@xcite here , @xmath1 denotes the virasoro generator of cft .",
    "then , an essential point is that the cft vacuum is annihilated by the deformation terms @xmath2 and @xmath3 , because of sl(2,r ) invariance , implying that the ground state of the ssd system is identical to that of the uniform system . also , a relevance of the ssd to string theory was discussed on the basis of the free boson in ref .",
