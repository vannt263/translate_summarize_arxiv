    "the experiments with the detector system hades @xcite at the heavy - ion synchrotron sis at gsi ( darmstadt ) are mainly aimed at measuring in - medium modifications of the light vector mesons via the @xmath2 decay channel with high accuracy . at higher beam energies , experiments of the ceres collaboration @xcite at cern sps",
    "evidenced already hints to noticeable modifications of the dilepton spectrum which can be reproduced under the assumption of a strong melting of the @xmath3 meson in a dense , strongly interacting medium at temperature close to the chiral transition @xcite .",
    "the great interest in studying properties of the light mesons in a hot / dense nuclear medium is caused by the expectation to find further evidences of the chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and baryon density .",
    "there are various theoretical indications concerning an important sensitivity of the meson spectral function to the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry in strongly interacting matter .",
    "in particular , at finite temperature the vector and axial - vector meson correlators become mixed in accordance with in - medium weinberg sum rules @xcite .",
    "such a mixing causes an increasing degeneracy between vector and axial - vector spectral functions which would manifest themselves as a decrease of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 meson mass splitting , for instance .",
    "similarly , the degeneracy of scalar ( @xmath5 channel ) and pseudo - scalar ( @xmath6 channel ) correlators found in lattice qcd @xcite can lead to a considerable enhancement of the @xmath5 meson spectral function at finite temperature and density @xcite .    in spite of substantial efforts undertaken to understand the nature of vector mesons in a dense medium",
    "there is so far no unique and widely accepted quantitative picture of their in - medium behavior .",
    "the brown and rho conjecture @xcite on the direct interlocking of vector meson masses and chiral quark condensate @xmath7 supplemented by the vector manifestation of chiral symmetry in medium @xcite predict a strong and quantitatively the same decrease of the in - medium @xmath3 and @xmath1 meson masses .    at the same time , model calculations based on various effective lagrangians ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) predict rather moderate and different mass shifts for @xmath3 and @xmath1 mesons in a dense medium . in order `` to match '' both sets of predictions one",
    "has to go beyond simplifications made in the above mentioned approaches : the in - medium vector meson mass shift is governed not only by @xmath8 but also by condensates of higher order to be calculated beyond mean - field approximation .",
    "further , effective lagrangian models are dealing with the scattering amplitudes in free space , so that the effects related to the in - medium change of the qcd condensates are hidden or even washed out .    the very consistent way to incorporate in - medium",
    "qcd condensates is trough qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the in - medium mass shift of the @xmath3 and @xmath1 mesons is dominated by the dependence of the four - quark condensate on the density . in the present letter we concentrate on the in - medium @xmath1 meson since the effect of the four - quark condensate is most pronounced for the isoscalar channel . within the borel qcd sum rule approach we go beyond the mean field approximation and",
    "use the linear density dependence of the four - quark condensate .",
    "we employ for the hadronic spectral function a constraint based on the general structure of the @xmath1 meson in - medium propagator with imaginary part of the self - energy delivered by an effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "our qcd sum rule evaluations show that the in - medium change of the four - quark condensate plays indeed a crucial rule for modifications of the @xmath1 spectral function .",
    "in particular , the sign of the @xmath1 meson mass shift is changed by variation of a parameter which describes the strength of the density dependence of the four - quark condensate . since the difference of the vector and axial vector correlators is proportional to the four - quark condensate , the sign of the @xmath1 meson mass shift , measured via the @xmath2 channel ,",
    "can serve as a tool for determining how fast the strongly interacting matter approaches the chiral symmetry restoration with increasing density .",
    "within qcd sum rules the in - medium @xmath1 meson is considered as a resonance in the current - current correlation function @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath1 meson four - momentum , @xmath11 denotes the time ordered product of the @xmath1 meson current operators @xmath12 , and @xmath13 stands for the expectation value in the medium . in what follows ,",
    "we focus on the ground state of the baryonic matter approximated by a fermi gas with nucleon density @xmath14 . in terms of quark field operators ,",
    "the @xmath1 meson current is given by @xmath15 . at zero momentum , @xmath16 , in the rest frame of the matter",
    "the correlator can be reduced to @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the correlator @xmath19 satisfies the twice subtracted dispersion relation , which can be written with @xmath20 as = - ^ ( 0 ) - q^2 _ 0^ ds , [ eq_10 ] with @xmath21 and @xmath22 as subtraction constants and @xmath23 .    as usual in qcd sum rules ( qsr ) @xcite , for large values of @xmath24 one can evaluate the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq_10 ] ) by the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xmath25 , where the coefficients @xmath26 include the well known wilson coefficients and the expectation values of the corresponding products of quark and gluon field operators , i.e. condensates .",
    "performing a borel transformation of the dispersion relation eq .",
    "( [ eq_10 ] ) with appropriate mass parameter @xmath27 and taking into account the ope one gets the basic qsr equation ( 0 ) + _ 0^ d s r(s ) e^-s / m^2 = m^2 c_0 + _ i=1^ .",
    "[ eq_20 ] the general structure of the coefficients @xmath26 up to @xmath28 is given , for instance , in @xcite . in order to calculate the density dependence of the condensates entering the coefficients @xmath29",
    "we employ the standard linear density approximation , which is valid for not too large density .",
    "this gives for the chiral quark condensate @xmath30 , where both the light quark masses and their condensates are taken to be the same , i.e. , @xmath31 mev and @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the nucleon sigma term is @xmath34 mev .",
    "the gluon condensate is obtained as usual employing the qcd trace anomaly @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the qcd coupling constant and @xmath37 mev is the nucleon mass in the chiral limit .",
    "the vacuum gluon condensate is @xmath38 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_20 ] ) contains also the four - quark condensates @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the standard approach to estimate their density dependence consists in the mean - field approximation .",
    "within such an approximation the four - quark condensates are proportional to @xmath42 and their density dependence is actually governed by the square of the chiral quark condensate . keeping in mind the important role of the four - quark condensate for the in - medium modifications of the @xmath1 meson @xcite we go beyond the above mean - field approximation and employ the following parameterization ( _ ^5 ^a q)^2_n = - ( _ ^a q)^2_n = q_0 ^ 2 _ 0 .",
    "[ eq_35 ] in vacuum , @xmath43 , the parameter @xmath44 reflects a deviation from the vacuum saturation assumption .",
    "the case @xmath45 corresponds obviously to the exact vacuum saturation as used , for instance , in @xcite . to control the deviation of the in - medium four - quark condensate from the mean - field approximation",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath46 .",
    "the limit @xmath47 recovers the mean - field approximation , while the case @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is related to a stronger ( weaker ) density dependence compared to the mean - field approximation .",
    "below we vary the parameter @xmath46 to estimate the contribution of the four - quark condensates to the qsr with respect to the main trends of the in - medium modification of the @xmath1 meson spectral function .    using the above condensates and usual wilson coefficients we get the coefficients @xmath29 as c_0 & = & ( 1 + ) , c_1 = - , + c_2 & = & m_q q_0 + n + + a_2 m_n n , + c_3 & = & - _ s _ 0 q_0 ^ 2 - a_4 m_n^3 n. [ eq_40 ] the last terms in @xmath50 correspond to the derivative condensates from nonscalar operators as a consequence of the breaking of lorentz invariance in the medium .",
    "these condensates are proportional to the moments @xmath51 $ ] of quark and antiquark distributions @xmath52 inside the nucleon at a scale @xmath53 ( see for details @xcite ) . our choice of the moments @xmath54 and @xmath55 is 1.02 and 0.12 , respectively .    to model the hadronic side of the qsr eq .",
    "( [ eq_20 ] ) we make the standard separation of the @xmath1 meson spectral density into resonance part and continuum contribution by means of the threshold parameter @xmath56 : r(s , n)= f ( s_0-s ) + c_0 ( s - s_0 ) , [ eq_45 ] where @xmath57 stands for the resonance peak in the spectral function ; the normalization @xmath58 is unimportant for the following consideration . in the majority of the qcd sum rule evaluations , the zero - width approximation @xcite or some schematic parameterization of @xmath59 @xcite",
    "are employed .",
    "in contrast to this , we use here a more realistic ansatz for the resonance spectral density @xmath59 based on the general structure of the in - medium vector meson propagator in the vicinity to the pole mass , s(s , n ) = - [ eq_50 ] with @xmath60 as imaginary part of the in - medium @xmath1 meson self - energy and @xmath61 as its physical mass . in eq .",
    "( [ eq_50 ] ) , the real part of the self  energy is absorbed in @xmath62 , which is determined by the qcd sum rule eq .",
    "( [ eq_20 ] ) . as a result ( see below ) , the in - medium change of the qcd condensates causes global modifications of the @xmath1 meson spectral function , in addition to the collision broadening .",
    "( an analogous approach was used in @xcite . )    within the linear density approximation the @xmath1 meson self - energy is given by ( e , n ) = ^vac ( e ) - nt^n ( e ) , [ eq_55 ] where @xmath63 is the @xmath1 meson energy , @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the off - shell forward @xmath1-nucleon scattering amplitude in free space .",
    "note , that the three - momentum of @xmath1 mesons in eq .",
    "( [ eq_55 ] ) is still zero , and nucleons are also assumed to be at rest .",
    "we take the needed @xmath66 from an effective lagrangian @xcite , which is based on vector meson dominance and chiral su(3 ) dynamics .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath66 in the region @xmath67 gev comes from the processes @xmath68 ( at @xmath69 gev ) and @xmath70 ( at @xmath71 gev ) , see @xcite for details .",
    "the process @xmath68 is at least partially under experimental control , while the contribution from the reaction @xmath70 appears to be sensitive to the poorly known meson - baryon form factors .",
    "however , this uncertainty does not spoil the results below .",
    "for definiteness , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot @xmath66 employed in our qsr evaluations . to simplify the calculations we also take @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the vacuum @xmath1 meson mass and decay width , respectively .",
    "following @xcite we use for the subtraction constant @xmath75 which is actually the thomson limit of the @xmath76 scattering process , but also coincides with the landau damping term elaborated in @xcite for the hadronic spectral function entering the dispersion relation without subtractions . for details about the relation of subtraction constants and the landau damping",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "taking the ratio of eq .",
    "( [ eq_20 ] ) to its derivative with respect to @xmath27 , and using eq .",
    "( [ eq_45 ] ) one gets = [ eq_60 ] with the coefficients @xmath29 from eq .",
    "( [ eq_40 ] ) and the spectral function @xmath57 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq_50 ] ) and ( [ eq_55 ] ) .",
    "one has to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq_60 ] ) to find the mass parameter @xmath77 . at a given density @xmath14 , the continuum threshold @xmath56",
    "is determined by requiring maximum flatness of @xmath78 within the borel window @xmath79 .",
    "the minimum borel mass @xmath80 is obtained such that the terms of order @xmath81 on the ope side contribute not more than 10% @xcite . according to our experience @xcite",
    ", @xmath82 is not very sensitive to variations of @xmath83 .",
    "we therefore fix the maximum borel mass by @xmath84 . to get the @xmath1 meson mass @xmath85 we average finally @xmath82 within the borel mass window .    the value of @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_35 ] ) is related to such a choice of the chiral condensate @xmath86 which adjusts the vacuum @xmath1 meson mass to @xmath87 mev resulting in @xmath88 .",
    "the ratio @xmath89 in the parameterization ( [ eq_35 ] ) is restricted by the conditions @xmath90 with increasing density and @xmath91 , so that one gets @xmath92 as numerical limits .",
    "the results of our qsr evaluations for @xmath62 for @xmath93 are exhibited in fig .",
    "the in - medium mass of the @xmath1 meson changes even qualitatively under variation of the parameter @xmath46 : for @xmath94 , @xmath85 increases with density , while for @xmath95 it drops . from the above considerations one can conclude that the sign of the in - medium mass shift is directly related to the density dependence of the four - quark condensate .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we display the in - medium change of the @xmath1 meson spectral function @xmath96 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_50 ] ) and calculated with density dependent mass @xmath61 .",
    "the in - medium spectral change is still seen to be dominated by the density dependence of the four - quark condensate .",
    "the dependence of the peak position as a function of the density @xmath14 and the four - quark parameter @xmath46 is the same as for @xmath97 .",
    "one can also observe that for the positive mass shift ( say , for @xmath98 ) the width increases with density , while for a negative mass shift ( say , for @xmath99 ) it appears to be approximately constant . in both cases",
    "we obtain a considerable `` melting '' of the in - medium @xmath1 meson : at @xmath100 the height of the resonance peak drops more than by a factor of 5 . for @xmath101",
    "the shift of the peak is small ; also here the peak is broadened .    because of the strong  melting  of the in - medium @xmath1 meson , an identification of its spectral change in matter will be an experimental challenge . moreover , in heavy - ion collisions one can expect also an additional broadening of the signal due to the collective expansion of the matter @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the high precision measurements planned with hades give a chance to observe at least an  in - medium shoulder  which supplements the vacuum peak .",
    "whether such a shoulder will occur at the right or left hand side of the vacuum peak is directly governed by the strength of the density dependence of the four - quark condensate .",
    "in summary we have found that , within the borel qcd sum rule approach , the in - medium spectral change of the @xmath1 meson is dominated by the density dependence of the four - quark condensate .",
    "we go beyond the standard mean - field approximation and vary with the parameter @xmath46 the strength of the four - quark condensate dependence on the density .",
    "the sign of the @xmath1 meson in - medium mass shift and the resonance peak position are shown to be governed by the value of @xmath46 .",
    "we find a strong  melting effect  of the in - medium @xmath1 meson resonance .",
    "only for positive mass shift we observe a considerable broadening of the in - medium @xmath1 meson spectral function .    the in - medium @xmath1 meson spectral change , in particular the sign of the mass shift , to be looked for via the @xmath102 channel with the hades detector in heavy - ion collisions , can give an important information on the yet unknown density dependence of the four - quark condensate and consequently on the chiral symmetry restoration in a dense nuclear medium .",
