    "optomechanical systems have witnessed spectacular developments in the last decade and can now operate deep in the quantum regime ( see e.g.  refs  @xcite for recent reviews ) . conventional cryogenic cooling for mechanical oscillators of relatively high frequencies in the gigahertz range or higher  @xcite , and",
    "alternatively sideband cooling at lower mechanical frequencies  @xcite have succeeded in bringing mechanical oscillators close to their quantum mechanical ground state .",
    "also , quantum entanglement and squeezed states of photons and phonons have been demonstrated in these systems  @xcite .",
    "these developments pave the way to the creation of a generation of quantum interfaces between light and mechanical systems with broad potential for applications in quantum technology .",
    "one example is the coherent interconversion between optical and mechanical excitations , which was proposed and analyzed in a number of earlier theoretical studies @xcite , and it has been used for the experimental realization of optomechanical light storage and readout @xcite .",
    "these effects are based on the mixing of photons and phonons into polariton normal modes .",
    "importantly in the context of the present paper , these excitations are in contact with the thermal reservoirs of the cavity mode and the mechanics which may have a large temperature difference .",
    "it is then possible to envision a quantum heat engine whose `` working fluid '' is a polariton mode of the optomechanical system @xcite . in this heat engine",
    "the properties of the polariton are controlled by the cavity - pump detuning : by adiabatically switching between the phonon side and the photon side , and enabling thermalization with the corresponding reservoirs , we may realize a quantum otto cycle .",
    "such a heat engine working deep in the quantum regime may have the potential for challenging the classic law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , consideration of the fast development in nano- and microelectromechanical systems ( nems and mems ) suggests that a quantum engine based on an optomechanical system may prove attractive in terms of manipulation , integration , and application .",
    "this paper presents a detailed theoretical analysis of the work and the efficiency of the optomechanical heat engine and investigates the quantum thermodynamics involved .",
    "it compares the thermodynamics in the normal mode and in the bare mode pictures , the associated interpretations of the physics bringing to the fore subtle aspects of the role of quantum correlations .",
    "it concludes by presenting results of numerical simulations of the full evolution of the otto cycle , including dissipation and noise , with parameters within reach of existing technology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii outlines the quantum model of the optomechanical system and analyzes key features of the polariton modes for various values of the cavity - pump detuning .",
    "section iii describes the four stages of the otto cycle and derives expressions for heat exchanged with reservoirs and work delivered .",
    "section iv discusses the limit of the thermal efficiency of the engine at maximum work .",
    "section v analyzes the effective master equation for the polaritons and discusses implications of the fact that they are coupled to squeezed baths when the bare modes of the system are coupled to thermal reservoirs .",
    "section vi turns the thermodynamics of the whole system and of its subsystems .",
    "an intuitive physical picture of the optomechanical engine is also suggested .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vii presents selected results of full numerical simulations of the engine , and sec .",
    "viii is a summary and outlook .",
    "we consider a generic optomechanical system consisting of a fabry - prot resonator with a compliant end mirror of effective mass @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 driven by the radiation pressure from a single - mode intracavity field .",
    "we assume the system has reached a mean - field steady state characterized by a classical intracavity field @xmath2 and corresponding normalized mirror displacement @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the zero - point mirror displacement . for small optical damping rates @xmath5 we have @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the amplitude of the pump and @xmath8 .",
    "this system is described by the linearized optomechanical hamiltonian @xcite @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the photon annihilation operator for the quantum fluctuations of the optical mode of frequency @xmath11 driven by a classical pump of frequency @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the operator describing the quantum fluctuations of the mechanics , @xmath14 is the effective detuning between the optical pump and the cavity mode , and @xmath15 is the single - photon optomechanical coupling .",
    "finally the linearized effective optomechanical coupling is @xmath16 we take it to be real and positive in this work without loss of generality .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h0 ] ) can be diagonalized in terms of two uncoupled bosonic normal modes , or polaritons , with annihilation operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 with corresponding eigenfrequencies @xmath20 ( see fig .   [ fig : two - branches ] ) .",
    "we consider the red - detuned regime ( @xmath21 ) where the beam - splitter interaction term @xmath22 plays a dominant role and the stability condition of the linearized optomechanical system ( @xmath23 ) gives @xmath24    to second order in @xmath25 and for @xmath26 , the normal mode frequencies reduce to @xmath27 for @xmath28 we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 , so that @xmath31 describes a photonlike excitation and @xmath32 a phononlike excitation .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath33 we have @xmath34 the polariton @xmath31 is then phononlike while @xmath32 is photonlike as @xmath35 . at the avoided crossing @xmath36",
    ", we have @xmath37 which shows that the minimum frequency difference between branches @xmath31 , @xmath32 is proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "so far , we have only discussed the coherent contribution for the dynamics of the optomechanical system .",
    "accounting in addition for optical and mechanical dissipation allows one to exploit the two thermal reservoirs to engineer a heat engine working between the  hot \" thermal bath responsible for the relaxation of the phonon mode and the  cold \" thermal bath due to the damping of the optical mode . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is then possible to operate the optomechanical system as a quantum otto cycle @xcite by varying the detuning @xmath39 while keeping the intracavity optical field @xmath2 constant . provided that nonadiabatic transitions between the two polariton branches can be avoided , each band can be associated with a different otto cycle .",
    "we now turn to a detailed discussion of these cycles .     and @xmath32 .",
    "see text for details.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we consider a situation where the optomechanical system is initially in thermal equilibrium at large red detuning , @xmath40 , so that the phononlike lower polariton branch @xmath32 is in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at effective temperature @xmath41  for all practical purposes the temperature of the phonon heat reservoir .",
    "similarly , the photonlike upper polariton branch @xmath31 is in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature @xmath42 , an excellent approximation at optical frequencies .",
    "since @xmath43 we have the initial polariton population @xmath44    the first stroke of the cycle is an adiabatic change of @xmath39 from its initial value @xmath45 to a final value @xmath46 ; this step has to be fast enough that the interaction of the system with the thermal reservoirs can be largely neglected , yet slow enough that nonadiabatic transitions between the two polariton branches are negligible .",
    "ideally , at the end of the stroke the lower - branch polariton becomes photonlike .",
    "it is then allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature @xmath47 , the temperature of the photon reservoir , while the upper polariton branch relaxes to the temperature of the phonon reservoir .",
    "this is the second stroke .",
    "the third stroke of the cycle involves sweeping the detuning back to its initial large negative value .",
    "again , this step has to be fast enough to avoid thermalization , but slow enough to avoid nonadiabatic transitions .",
    "the final stroke is the rethermalization at fixed detuning @xmath48 : this leads to essentially the temperature of the phonon reservoir , @xmath41 , for the lower polariton branch and to @xmath49 for the upper branch .",
    "we stress that the amplitude of the driving classical field needs to be adjusted during the detuning changes so that the intracavity amplitude is kept constant .",
    "the otto cycles associated with the two polariton branches are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : otto - cycles ] .    denoting by @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 the energies of the system at the four nodes of these cycles",

    "similarly , @xmath62 and @xmath63 so that @xmath64 . that is , in the thermal cycle operated along the polariton branch @xmath31 work is performed _ on _ the system , associated with the release of heat .",
    "in contrast , in the cycle along branch @xmath32 heat is absorbed by the system with corresponding work performed _ by _ the system .",
    "cycle @xmath32 thus represents an otto heat engine : it receives heat from the high temperature reservoir and partially converts it to work , while releasing the remaining heat to the low temperature reservoir .",
    "this is the process we are interested in .",
    "the efficiency of cycle @xmath32 is defined by the ratio between the total work and the input heat @xcite @xmath65 figure  [ fig : the - thermal - efficient ] shows @xmath66 and @xmath67 as a function of @xmath68 and the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath69 .",
    "( we do not show their dependence on @xmath48 because the energy spectrum of mode @xmath32 is weakly dependent on it for large negative values . )",
    "the efficiency @xmath70 is independent of the thermal mean polariton number and is maximized for @xmath71 , which is precisely the stability condition of the system , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : omn ] ) and ( [ stable ] ) .",
    "this means that the thermal efficiency could be large even for large optomechanical interaction strengths and final detuning far from zero , provided that they are close to the instability threshold  ( [ stable ] ) , @xmath72 . however , this is not the case for the total work @xmath67 that reaches its maximum value at small @xmath73 and with a near - resonant @xmath74 .",
    "we finally note that the cycle @xmath31 is a reversed engine whose efficiency is defined by the ratio between the total work and the output heat @xmath75 in the limiting case @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , we find @xmath79 . in order to maximize the work extracted from the system",
    "we should therefore avoid the occurrence of nonadiabatic transitions between the two cycles .",
    "we now proceed with a more quantitative description of the otto cycle along branch @xmath32 . for the situations considered here , where the polariton system is adiabatically switched from the phononlike side to the photonlike side and back , it is convenient to work in the bare mode picture , rather than with the dressed polariton modes .",

    "specifically , in the polariton picture we have @xmath189+{\\rm tr}[\\rho_{b}dh_{b}],\\ ] ] where @xmath190 is the density matrix of the normal mode @xmath32 . since the transformation is adiabatic , we have @xmath191 so that @xmath192=0\\\\ du & = & { \\rm tr}[\\rho_{b}dh_{b}]=dw_{b}.\\label{duwb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , as the detuning @xmath193 is changed from a large negative value to zero , @xmath194 decreases , so that @xmath195 , indicative of the fact that work is produced by the heat engine .",

    "this term is much smaller than @xmath205 and @xmath206 for the weak optomechanical couplings considered here , and interestingly , does not have a corresponding classical thermodynamical quantity .",
    "summarizing , in the dressed picture the first stroke of the heat engine adiabatically switches the polariton from a phononlike to a photonlike excitation and it performs work on the external control field . in the bare mode picture , the phonon mode releases heat , part of which is then absorbed by the photon field , a small amount contributing to quantum correlation , and the rest being absorbed by the external control field .",
    "similar results can also be obtained for the second stroke of the otto cycle , with @xmath207 in eq .",

    "the vibration amplitudes of the cavity mirror and the cavity field represent the population of the phonon and photon mode , respectively .    during stroke 1 the detuning @xmath193 is varied so that @xmath12 is brought closer to resonance with the cavity mode frequency @xmath11 , while simultaneously changing the pumping rate @xmath7 so as to keep mean intracavity amplitudes @xmath2 and @xmath187 , and hence the coupling frequency @xmath211 , constant .",
    "as this happens the phononlike thermal excitations , which are initially large due to the contact with a thermal reservoir that is essentially at the temperature of the mechanics , are transformed into photonlike excitations .",
    "this occurs at a rate characterized by the coupling frequency @xmath211 . during this step",
    "the amplitude of vibrations of the mechanics decreases and the excess energy is transferred to the intracavity field . as a result",
    "the resonator length increases slightly due to the increased radiation pressure .",
    "it is at this point that the mechanical work on the oscillator is produced by the optomechanical heat engine .",
    "however , this work is very small due to the disproportion between the steady amplitudes and the quantum fluctuations of the photon and phonon fields . during the thermalization step of stroke 2",
    "the population of the photonlike excitations decays at rate @xmath137 ( for a photon reservoir at zero temperature ) with the cavity length unchanged . in stroke 3 the remaining photonlike polariton",
    "excitations are turned back into phonon - like quanta by adjusting @xmath193 .",
    "this costs a small amount of work , resulting in a small contraction of the cavity length .",
    "the population of the phonon - like polariton excitation finally grows up to its initial value via thermal contact with the hot mechanical reservoir during stroke 4 .",
    "the small polariton number in stroke ( 3 ) ensures that the total output work of the otto cycle is positive .    .",
    "initially ( first figure ) the mechanics undergoes relatively large thermal fluctuations due to its coupling to a hot thermal reservoir .",
    "after the adiabatic step 1 , the polariton becomes photonlike , with its still - unchanged mean occupation becoming photonlike , resulting in added radiation pressure force on the mechanics .",
    "thermalization at the low radiation field temperature significantly reduces the polariton occupation number in step 2 . after the adiabatic step 3",
    "the polariton has regained its phononic nature with a small adjustment of the mirror position .",

    "the adiabatic strokes 1 and 3 of the otto cycle involve changes of the cavity detuning from @xmath212 to @xmath213 . to ensure the adiabaticity of the transformation , their times @xmath214 and @xmath215 must be much longer than the characteristic time of the transition between the two polariton branches @xmath216 . from eq .",

    "requires therefore that @xmath222 finally , the last stroke should be long enough for the polariton to rethermalize with the phonon reservoir . combining these considerations results in the hierarchy of rates @xmath223 the limiting factor for a fast execution of the cycle",
    "is then given by the slow thermalization with the mechanics , @xmath138 .",
    "in addition , we assume in the simulations described in the following subsections that the optomechanical coupling @xmath211 is constant during the adiabatic strokes , a condition that can be satisfied by controlling the amplitude of the classical driving field as the cavity detuning is varied .      to simulate all aspects of the proposed otto cycle , including nonadiabatic transitions between the lower and upper polariton branches and the effects of dissipation",
    ", we have solved numerically the full master equation ( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "as already discussed , for small optomechanical couplings it is appropriate to start from the factorized thermal state @xmath224 where @xmath225 and @xmath225 are the thermal state of the photon and the phonon modes , respectively .",
    "our numerical simulations were carried out in a fock states basis of the bare modes , with a cutoff number state @xmath226 with @xmath227 , so that the total dimension of the density matrix @xmath228 is @xmath229 . as a result",
    "the simulations become very time consuming even for relatively modest values of @xmath230 . however , due to the diagonality of thermal states in an energy basis the total density matrix of the combined system remains in practice quite sparse for weak optomechanical couplings , and an algorithm optimization for sparse matrices is helpful to reduce the simulation time . to utilize the specific advantage of matlab in the calculation of large sparse matrices , we expressed all creation and annihilation operators in matrix form so that the master equation ( [ eq : master ] ) was converted into a matrix equation , and then used a fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm to evolve the matrix equation , with convergence tested by increasing @xmath230 .",
    "figure  [ fig : evolution ] shows the dynamics of the population of the bare modes @xmath231 and @xmath232 and of the polariton modes @xmath31 and @xmath32 for a full loop of the otto cycle .",
    "we assume a small thermal mean phonon number @xmath233 and truncate the number state representation at @xmath234 .",
    "for a mechanical resonator of frequency @xmath235 , it corresponds to a phonon reservoir temperature @xmath236 , which is in the parameter range of present optomechanical experiments .",
    "the mean photon number is zero .",
    "the initial detuning is @xmath237 and we choose the final detuning @xmath238 to avoid the unstable region near the cavity resonance .",
    "other parameters are listed in the figure caption .    as shown in the figure , in the first stroke the population of the polaritons @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "initially coincides with the mean photon and phonon number , respectively . during the change in detuning , in the ideal case",
    ", the photon and the phonon mode would exchange their population while keeping the polariton numbers constant . in practice ,",
    "the variation of the detuning is not slow enough to avoid transitions between the two polariton branches .",
    "meanwhile , the cavity and mechanical damping rates result in a small decay and increment of the polariton @xmath32 and @xmath31 , respectively . in the simulation",
    "we vary the detuning linearly in time , but an optimization of the pulse shape might result in a more effective transformation . for instance , one might change the detuning fast for large values and only slow down close to the avoided crossing at @xmath90 .    in the second stroke , the photonlike polariton @xmath32 decays fast due to the cavity decay , while the thermalization of the phononlike polariton @xmath31 , at rate @xmath138 , is negligible .",
    "this step is also characterized by rabi oscillations between photon and phonon populations due to the optomechanical coupling .",
    "the polariton @xmath32 then recovers its phononlike properties in the third stroke and finally rethermalizes to its initial population at the end of the last stroke ( not shown , at @xmath239 ) .",
    "the total cycle takes a time of the order @xmath240 .",
    "note that the population of polariton @xmath31 remains small throughout the whole cycle , its effect on the engine can be safely neglected as we did in the previous discussion .",
    "figure  [ fig : distribution ] shows the number state distribution of the photon and phonon modes at each node of the otto cycle .",

    "[ fig : distribution](b ) ] situations for the first stroke , the phonon and the photon almost exactly exchange their number distributions , except for a small particle loss .",
    "initially both the photon and the phonon excitations are in their own thermal equilibrium with @xmath136 and @xmath242 determined by their reservoir temperatures , but after following the adiabatic change in detuning they are in nonequilibrium states , with no well - defined temperatures . at this point both @xmath198 and @xmath199 have nonvanishing nondiagonal elements , as the density matrix @xmath197 of the full system exhibits quantum correlation between the photon and the phonon resulting from the optomechanical interaction  ( [ v ] ) .",
    "they tend to return to thermal equilibrium during the second stroke [ from fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution](b ) to fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution](c ) ] , but the phonon mode is prevented from completely doing so , given the short time compared to its dissipation rate .",
    "as we recall from the previous section this is a necessary requirement to guarantee that the polariton @xmath31 population remains small .",
    "a conversion similar to the first one happens in the third stroke , [ from fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution](c ) to fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution](d ) ] .",
    "finally the photon and the phonon recover their initial thermal equilibrium [ fig [ fig : distribution](a ) ] after a time that is long compared to @xmath243 .",
    "in summary , we have presented a detailed theoretical study of a simple quantum optomechanical heat engine based on changing the nature of its normal modes from phononlike to photonlike , and we provided an intuitive picture of its operation .",
    "we have discussed the performance of the engine , recovering a quantum version of the curzon - ahlborn efficiency at maximum work .",
    "much insight into the underlying physics of this system can be gained by comparing its description in terms of normal modes ( polaritons ) and bare modes .",
    "we found that the polariton description provides an unambiguous distinction between heat exchange and work , but there are subtleties associated with the fact that polaritons are generally coupled to squeezed reservoirs when the bare modes are coupled to thermal reservoirs . in the case of strong optomechanical coupling this may lead to novel features , including possibly a violation of the carnot efficiency limit , which will be explored in future work .",
    "the bare mode picture is intuitively appealing and illustrates clearly the role of quantum correlations between photons and phonons in the work acting on the system but lacks a clear decomposition of the otto cycle into adiabatic and thermalization strokes .",
