    "the @xmath7-@xmath8 correlation may also be interpreted as evidence that the formation probability of gas giant planets is greatly enhanced in metal - rich protostellar disks , in accordance with the core - accretion scenario for formation of giant planets , e.g. , @xcite .    in the conventional core - accretion scenario , heavy elements ( metals ) in a protoplanetary disk condense into grains which form km - sized planetesimals . through gravitational interaction and coagulation ,",

    "so , in the nominal case , we adopt @xmath58 , but @xmath59 and @xmath60 are also examined ( the latter corresponds to the gas accretion including phase 2 ) .    the gas accretion rate increases rapidly with @xmath0 .",
    "such runaway gas accretion is terminated when the residual gas is depleted globally on timescale @xmath61 or it is severely depleted locally in the vicinity of their orbits due to gap opening , which is assumed to occur if their hill radius exceeds 1.5 times the disk scale height ( paper i ) .",
    "when @xmath0 becomes a significant fraction of @xmath62 ( jupiter mass ) , planets tidal torque on the disk becomes larger than the viscous torque of the disk gas , resulting in a partial gap opening , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it reduces gas accretion rate .",
    "bondi accretion limit also becomes important in the reduction .",
    "however , the elongated accretion timescale may be still shorter than @xmath54 for @xmath63 several @xmath3 , so that the limited accretion at high @xmath0 may not affect the mass distribution of gas giants significantly .",

    "this region divides the terrestrial ( rocky ) planet , gas and ice giant domains in the planets mass - period distribution .",
    "planetary migration generally sharpens the boundaries of the domains ( paper i ; @xcite ) . since migration is slower for larger @xmath0 ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : tau_mig ] ] ) , relatively massive planets are less likely to migrate to inner regions , resulting in a deficit of planets with @xmath5 at @xmath6au ( fig .",
    "1a ; also see discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "if larger @xmath69 is adopted , @xmath71 becomes short compared with @xmath61 , so that even relatively massive planets can migrate significantly , resulting in less clear deficit .",
    "we found that the two planet - depleted regions exist for other @xmath108 as well , because the `` planet desert '' and the other are determined by the core accretion model for gas giants and @xmath109 , respectively .",

    "the simulated @xmath1-distribution of the gas giant planets can match with the observation [ figure 1c ; also see @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "the 0.04 au cut - off in the planets @xmath1 distribution in our results may also be less abrupt and more consistent with the observed distributions if we adopt more relaxed inner boundary conditions .",
    "many of giant planets may have migrated toward the vicinity of their host stars @xcite .",
    "the theoretically determined ratio of the giant planets with @xmath111au ( hot jupiters ) to those between 0.22au is @xmath9910 for stars with @xmath112 , which is order of magnitude larger than its observed value ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that more than @xmath114 of the hot jupiters which migrated to the stellar vicinity are either consumed @xcite or tidally disrupted @xcite by their host stars .",
    "provided these disruptive events occur before the host stars become main sequence stars with relatively shallow convection zones , their apparent chemical homogeneity may be preserved to match the observation of the pleiades cluster @xcite .",
    "as the migrating protoplanets sweep planetesimals along their paths , this process may self - regulate the amount of residual heavy elements in the disk .",
    "figures 1c and d show that the normalized slopes of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 distributions are independent of @xmath115 , because they are determined by @xmath109 and the core accretion model for gas giants , respectively . in these figures",
    ", we do not include planets stalled at 0.04au , since a large fraction of them may plunge into their host stars .",
    "although the normalized distributions are independent of @xmath115 , we found that formation and retention rates of gas giant planets rapidly increase with @xmath115 . in order to account for the @xmath115-dependence in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 distribution ,",
    "we first describe how planet formation depends on @xmath18 [ for details , see paper i and @xcite ] . in a disk similar to the mmn ( @xmath89 ) , for @xmath116 , the core growth is limited to @xmath117 where @xmath107 is the earth mass .",
    "although growth beyond isolation ( up to @xmath118 ) is possible for terrestrial planets , it is attainable only after severe gas depletion @xcite . at these regions ,",
    "both @xmath10 and @xmath39 are @xmath119 such that the cores can not acquire a massive gaseous envelope . at the outer regions where @xmath120 ,",
    "although @xmath121 , the timescale required for @xmath35 to reach @xmath64 is @xmath122 .",
    "the cores evolve into ice giants , similar to uranus and neptune . in the disk similar to th",
    "mmn , gas giants can form only slightly outside the ice boundary , because the cores may acquire @xmath64 there within a few myr and enter a rapid gas accretion phase prior to the global disk depletion .",
    "gas giants can form inside @xmath24 in some massive disks ( with @xmath123 ) .",
    "rocky cores are formed with @xmath124 in the inner regions and ice giants are formed with @xmath125 in the outer regions of low - mass disks with @xmath126 , without formation of gas giants .    around metal - deficient stars ,",
    "formation efficiency of gas giants is low because disks with sufficiently large @xmath18 are only at the tail end of the distribution . around the metal - rich stars ,",
    "the efficiency is high because both @xmath37 and @xmath10 increase rapidly with @xmath18 ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : m_grow0 ] and [ eq : isom ] ) and @xmath127 even interior to @xmath24 .",

    "these results indicate @xmath7 increases linearly with @xmath130 , which is consistent with observational results of @xcite ( open circles in figures 2 ) .",
    "as shown in figure 2a , @xmath7 does not depend on the choice of @xmath54 [ @xmath131 or @xmath60 ; @xmath132 nor that of asymptotic core mass [ min@xmath133 or @xmath134 .",
    "the reasons are as follows .",
    "as long as @xmath54 has strong dependence on @xmath135 , even significant change in @xmath136 results in relatively small change of @xmath64 , the core mass that enables rapid gas accretion prior to disk gas depletion . since in our simulations ,",
    "most gas giant planets are formed with such parameter ranges where @xmath18 and @xmath1 are relatively large and @xmath137 , the distributions hardly change even if @xmath138 is adopted in entire @xmath18 and @xmath1 ( although it affects the distributions of terrestrial planets [ paper i ] ) .",
    "although the absolute values of @xmath7 are higher / lower for faster / slower core accretion , the dependence on @xmath115 is similar ( figure 2b ) .",
    "if disk depletion is caused by viscous diffusion , the assumption that @xmath139 at @xmath140 au is reasonable .",
    "however , the observation of dense clusters suggest that gas depletion in protostellar disks is primarily driven by photo - evaporation @xcite in these clusters , where a few massive stars contribute to nearly the entire uv ionizing flux . in order to consider the possibility of rapid gas depletion in a dense cluster , we carried out the additional simulations with @xmath141@xmath78 yrs . in this case ,",
    "formation rates of giant planets are lower , resulting in smaller @xmath7 ( figure 2b ) .",
    "but , the dependence on @xmath115 does not change also in this case .",
    "this general agreement is a generic feature of the core accretion scenario and the assumption for @xmath18 and @xmath30 .",
    "it may not arise naturally from the gravitational instability scenario @xcite .",
    "through monte carlo simulation using the deterministic planet formation model developed in paper i , we find that the formation probability of gas giant planets increases rapidly with the metallicity of their host stars .",
    "our model quantitatively accounts for observational correlation between stellar metallicity and the fraction of stars harboring giant planets that are detectable with the current doppler survey .",
    "our model also explains the two observationally suggested planet - depleted regions in @xmath0-@xmath1 distributions of extrasolar planets : the deficit in intermediate mass @xmath2100@xmath3 and @xmath4au , and that in large mass @xmath5 and @xmath6au .",
    "our model can be tested by more detailed observation .",
    "we show that the normalized slope of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 distributions of gas giants and the planet - depleted regions are independent of @xmath115 , because these are regulated by @xmath109 and the core accretion model .",
