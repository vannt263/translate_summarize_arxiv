    "in the now widely accepted hierarchical picture of structure formation , massive galaxy clusters form through a series of successive mergers of smaller clusters and infalling groups , as well as through continuous accretion of matter in their surroundings . both numerical simulations ( e.g. , colberg et al .",
    "2000 ) and theoretical work ( bond et al .  1996",
    "; yess & shandarin 1996 ) predict that this growth process proceeds in a highly non - isotropic fashion with infall and mergers occurring along preferred directions , resulting in spatially highly correlated structures often referred to as the `` cosmic web '' ( bond et al .",
    "1996 ) .    while there is overwhelming qualitative evidence in support of this picture from large - scale galaxy redshift surveys ( e.g. , geller & huchra 1989 ; york et al .",
    "2000 ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) , such surveys sample only a very small volume to a depth sufficient to probe the scales of several megaparsecs that characterize the actual infall region around clusters .",
    "also , galaxies are expected to represent only a small fraction of the total baryonic mass contained in filaments which  according to some estimates  could rival the mass content of clusters ( cen & ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "observational evidence of diffuse gas and dark matter in these filamentary structures has , however , proven difficult to obtain , owing to the low densities involved . the direct detection of filaments in the vicinity of galaxy clusters thus remains an observational challenge that is central to our understanding of the cluster formation process .",
    "in this letter we present the optical discovery of a large - scale filament associated with a massive x - ray - selected galaxy cluster at @xmath6 . throughout",
    "we assume a @xmath7 cold dark matter cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "using simulations conducted by the virgo consortium , colberg et al.(1999 ) investigate the relation between the infall pattern around massive clusters and the large - scale filamentary structure surrounding them .",
    "as expected in a filamentary universe , they find the infall onto clusters to occur preferentially from distinct directions .",
    "interestingly , there is a tight correlation between the infall directions at different times for a given cluster : although different filaments dominate the infall at different times ( redshifts ) , the filaments themselves are stable over the full redshift range of the simulation . while filaments funneling matter onto the cluster contribute to the observed large - scale structure over a wide range of scales , all filaments are much more prominent in the vicinity of massive clusters , the infall region , than in between clusters .",
    "colberg and co - workers study also confirms the relevance of filaments for the baryon budget of the universe : at radii between 4 and 6.5 mpc more than 40% of the total mass is contained in filaments .",
    "observational evidence of diffuse gas or galaxy overdensities in three - dimensional space ( not to mention dark matter ) in filaments is sparse .",
    "x - ray detections of filaments have been reported for superclusters and double clusters ( kull & bhringer 1999 , tittley & henriksen 2001 ) , but the interpretation of these findings as evidence of filaments has been questioned on the grounds that the observed emission might be due to gas swept out of these cluster associations in earlier merger events .",
    "briel & henry ( 1995 ) find an upper limit on the x - ray surface brightness of filaments between clusters of @xmath11 erg cm@xmath4 s@xmath13 arcmin@xmath4 ( 0.52.0 kev ) from _ rosat _ all - sky survey data .",
    "this value is about an order of magnitude lower than the x - ray surface brightness detected by e.g. , kull & bhringer .",
    "more recent work by kodama et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and durret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is promising in the sense that filamentary structures are detected in the vicinity of isolated galaxy clusters .",
    "unfortunately , the hypothesized filaments all lie well within the virial radius of the cluster and may thus again be merger residuals rather than genuine filaments .",
    "the most promising possible detection ( @xmath14 ) of a filament thus remains the half - degree long x - ray feature discussed by scharf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) which , at @xmath15 erg cm@xmath4 s@xmath13 arcmin@xmath4 ( 0.52.0 kev ) , has an x - ray surface brightness consistent with predictions .",
    "scharf and coworkers tentatively identify their discovery as a filament extending over at least 8 mpc ( for an assumed redshift of @xmath16 ) . without discernible connection to a massive cluster of galaxies within the study region ,",
    "this filament is , however , again unlikely to be the kind of structure predicted to funnel matter onto massive clusters at the densest vertices of the cosmic web .",
    "the massive galaxy cluster macsj0717.5 + 3745 [ @xmath17 = 07@xmath18 17@xmath19 31.5@xmath20 , @xmath21 = + 37@xmath22 45 25  ( j2000 ) ] , was independently discovered as the host of a diffuse radio source by edge et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and as a bright x - ray source in the course of the massive cluster survey ( macs ; ebeling et al.2001 ) .",
    "extensive follow - up observations of macsj0717.5 + 3745 , one of the most massive clusters known at @xmath23 and a severely disturbed system , have been conducted by the macs team at energies ranging from hard x - rays to submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "the detection of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in the direction of macsj0717.5 + 3745 is reported by laroque and coworkers ( 2003 ) ; a detailed investigation of the system s x - ray properties and a weak - lensing study of the dark matter distribution around macsj0717.5 + 3745 are in preparation .",
    "deep imaging observations of macsj0717.5 + 3745 in the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 passbands were performed with the suprimecam wide - field camera ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) on the subaru 8.3 m telescope on mauna kea in december 2000 and 2001 .",
    "suprimecam provides a large field of view of @xmath28 and a 0.2  pixel@xmath13 scale .",
    "the integration times in @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 were @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 minutes , and the seeing ( as measured from the final , co - added frames ) was 0.60  , 0.88  , 0.74  , and 0.60  , respectively .",
    "multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) observations of galaxies in the macsj0717.5 + 3745 field were performed on the keck 10 m telescope using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) in 2000 november , 2002 january , and 2002 november .",
    "additional mos follow - up observations were obtained using the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph on keck ii in 2003 december , and the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; hook et al .",
    "2003 ) on gemini north in 2004 march .",
    "full details of the observational setup are provided by e.  barrett et al .",
    "( 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "redshifts were determined via a multi - template cross - correlation method typically emphasizing the calcium h and k lines ( see ebeling et al .  2004 for details ) .",
    "figure 1 shows a color - magnitude diagram for all galaxies within 2 mpc of the nominal cluster center ( slightly less than the nominal virial radius of 2.3 mpc ) as obtained from our subaru data .",
    "the cluster red sequence is clearly visible .",
    "galaxies within the gray band ( corresponding to @xmath33 and @xmath2 values within @xmath34 mag of the red sequence ) were given highest priority for follow - up spectroscopy ; bluer galaxies were included where permitted by the mask design constraints .",
    "figure 2 shows a @xmath35 arcmin@xmath36 subregion of the @xmath37 suprimecam image .",
    "overlaid are the contours of the surface density of galaxies with @xmath33 and @xmath2 colors consistent with the cluster red sequence ( highlighted by the shaded region in fig .  1 ) .",
    "adaptive - kernel smoothing has been applied such that the significance of all features within the bold , red contour is at least 3 @xmath38 .",
    "the full extent of the galaxy overdensity ( including the cluster ) is 6.3 mpc , of which about 4.3 mpc can be attributed to the filament .",
    "this apparently coherent structure thus extends well beyond the virial radius ( @xmath1 mpc ) of the cluster at its northwestern endpoint , making it the first convincing candidate for the type of filament found to channel matter onto massive clusters in the numerical simulations of , e.g. , colberg and coworkers .",
    "the galaxy surface densities within the filament are found to range from 10 to 20 galaxies mpc@xmath4 with our @xmath26 band magnitude limit of 22.5 corresponding to a limiting @xmath24 band luminosity ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) for field galaxies in the local universe , moderate passive evolution in @xmath39 of @xmath40 mag out to @xmath3 , and a typical color of @xmath41 for an elliptical galaxy at @xmath3 .",
    "] of 0.10 l@xmath42 at @xmath3 .    to test the hypothesis that the apparently coherent structure evident in fig .",
    "2 is indeed a large - scale filament connected to macsj0717.5 + 3745 , we need to establish whether the color selection illustrated in fig .  1 and applied in fig .",
    "2 selects primarily galaxies at the cluster redshift .",
    "figure 3 shows that the spatial distribution of all galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts as of 2004 march samples the full extent of the galaxy overdensity of fig .  2 .",
    "4 demonstrates ( 1 ) that the redshift distribution of galaxies within the cluster proper is indistinguishable from the one in the filament , and ( 2 ) that our @xmath2 color criterion is efficient at selecting galaxies at @xmath43 , i.e. , the cluster redshift .",
    "we conclude that the entire filament as shown in fig .",
    "2 is located at @xmath6 and thus at the same redshift as the massive galaxy cluster at its northwestern endpoint .",
    "macsj0717.5 + 3745 is one of the most massive clusters known at @xmath23 with a pronounced double - peaked galaxy distribution indicative of an ongoing merger event , and a radio relic near the core suggesting additional recent merger activity ( edge et al .",
    "our discovery of a large - scale filament leading into the cluster extends the evidence for significant dynamical activity to scales of at least 5 mpc from the cluster core , well beyond the virial radius of 2.3 mpc .",
    "although numerical simulations by balogh , navarro & morris ( 2000 ) suggest that some fraction of the galaxies observed as far out as twice the virial radius from the center of a massive cluster may have been scattered there by previous interactions with the cluster core , their distribution should be approximately isotropic and strongly declining with radius .",
    "neither is the case for this filament which therefore should consist predominantly of matter approaching the cluster for the first time .",
    "the cluster merger axis points to the north - west in excellent alignment with the overall orientation of the filament , suggesting that the current merger activity is due to a group from the filament falling into the cluster core .",
    "the prominence of the filament out to at least 4 mpc implies that infall of matter in the same direction will persist for roughly the next 4 gyr assuming an infall rate of @xmath44 km s@xmath13 ( @xmath45 mpc gyr@xmath13 ) .    extending to ( and possibly beyond ) a distance of 45 mpc from the cluster core ,",
    "the filament is detected as a pronounced overdensity of galaxies with @xmath2 colors within @xmath46 mag of the cluster red sequence . at measured densities of typically 4 ( 15 , 30 ) mpc@xmath4 for red galaxies with @xmath47 ( 0.1 , 0.02 ) @xmath48 at @xmath3 , the most diffuse part of the contiguous filament leading into macsj0717.5 + 3745 is as dense as the clumps of ( mainly ) red galaxies around a851 ( @xmath49 ) discovered by kodama et al .",
    "the prevalence of early - type galaxies in our filament is also in qualitative agreement with recent studies based on the two - degree field and sloan digitial sky survey galaxy catalogs ( e.g. , gmez et al .",
    "2003 ; balogh et al .  2004 ) , which find the star formation rates in nearby galaxies ( @xmath50 ) to be significantly reduced already in environments of even lower density .",
    "we conclude that the observed galaxy distribution in and around macsj0717.5 + 3745 lends strong support to a picture in which massive clusters grow via discrete as well as continuous infall of matter along large - scale filaments .",
    "the high galaxy densities observed in the macsj0717.5 + 3745 filament and the prevalence of early - type galaxies in it make this structure a prime target for a detailed investigation of the physical processes and environmental effects governing the transition from field to cluster galaxies .",
    "additional observations are planned to map the dark matter distribution along the filament via weak lensing and to measure galaxy morphologies and colors in this region .",
    "we thank ian smail for allowing us to use some of the spectroscopic data obtained during his gmos run of 2004 march 1517 , as well as for very helpful advice during the preparation of this letter .",
