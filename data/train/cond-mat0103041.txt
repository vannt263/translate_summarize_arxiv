    "in a recent paper , one of the authors ( dch ) [ 1 ] proposed that hard spheres in the presence of gravitational field , @xmath0 , undergo a condensation transition , and identified the transition temperature , @xmath1 , as a function of external parameters , i.e. : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mass and diameter of the hard spheres , @xmath5 is the dimensionless layer thickness at @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a constant that reflects the particular manner in which a system packs upon condensing .",
    "it was noted that there exists a critical temperature @xmath1 below which the total number of particles is not conserved .",
    "this is the temperature at which the density at the bottom layer becomes the close - packed density .",
    "now , since the hard spheres can not be compressed indefinitely , if the temperature is lowered below @xmath1 , then the first layer should remain at the close - packed state , while the particles at the second layer try to compact themselves and thus crystallize .",
    "the crystallization then proceeds upward from the bottom layer as the temperature is lowered .",
    "this picture was later confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations [ 2 ] for mono - disperse hard spheres and was extended to the segregation of binary mixtures of hard spheres of different mass and diameters [ 3 ] .    in the original work [ 1 ] ,",
    "the enskog kinetic equation was used to obtain the density profile of hard spheres under gravity . however , in an attempt to solve a highly nonlinear integro - differential kinetic equation , it was assumed that the equilibrium velocity distribution function , @xmath8 , factorizes into a product of space and velocity dependent parts , i.e. @xmath9 and further that the functional form of @xmath10 is gaussian , which should be valid for elastic hard spheres . the factorization assumption is an equilibrium ansatz , which states that the configurational statistics are separated out from the kinetics when the system is at equilibrium , so that all the equilibrium quantities can be obtained from the configurational integral of the partition function .",
    "the equilibrium state is then the configuration that minimizes the free energy .",
    "therefore , we find it necessary to obtain the results of ref .",
    "[ 1 ] by the variational method .",
    "indeed , we will show in this paper that essentially identical results follow from an application of density functional theory ( dft ) [ 5 ] for liquids to the problem .",
    "we will first employ the simplest form of the density functional theory known as the local density approximation ( lda ) , which assumes that the range of inter - particle interaction is much smaller than the typical length scale on which @xmath11 varies [ 6 ] .",
    "we will show that the lda and the enskog theories are in fact identical , so that in both methods , the condensation temperature is defined as the temperature at which the sum rule breaks down .",
    "next , we will analyze the problem with a simple weighted density approximation ( wda ) [ 6 - 9 ] , which takes into account the local variation of the density function . in this approximation",
    ", the condensation temperature is defined as the temperature at which the volume density at the bottom layer reaches the maximum allowed value . in this approximation ,",
    "microscopic information is preserved in the density profile ; notably the formation of a crystal shows up in the density profile as oscillations .",
    "the peak to peak distance of this oscillation is approximately the particle diameter .",
    "we will demonstrate that the results of both analyses present a picture identical to those presented in ref .",
    "[ 1 ] ; in particular we will show how the value @xmath7 that appears in eq .",
    "( 1 ) depends on the approximation .",
    "the essence of the lda is to assume that the system may be divided into small pieces of nearly constant density and then to treat each piece as though it were part of a homogeneous system [ 6 ] . under these assumptions",
    "one may write a free energy functional : @xmath12 = \\int d{\\bf{r}}\\rho({\\bf { r}})\\psi(\\rho({\\bf { r } } ) ) + \\int d{\\bf{r } } \\rho({\\bf { r } } ) u_{ext}({\\bf { r}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the helmholtz free energy per particle in the absence of an external field and @xmath14 is the potential energy per particle due to an external field such as gravity .",
    "minimization of this functional under the global constraint that the number of particles is given by @xmath15 should yield the desired density profile . to be more specific ,",
    "we define variables for hard spheres of mass @xmath3 confined in a @xmath16 dimensional volume @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the cross sectional area of a @xmath19 dimensional plane and @xmath20 being the height of the container along which the gravitational field is acting .",
    "the helmholtz free energy per particle consists of two terms , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ideal gas contribution , @xmath23 note that @xmath24 with the single particle partition function @xmath25 [ 10 ] and that we have redefined the thermal wavelength @xmath26 .",
    "next , @xmath27 is the excess contribution to the free energy is due to the configurational integral coming from the interactions among particles and is in general written as the integral : @xmath28 the above equation can be derived from the thermodynamic relation , @xmath29 with the chain rule : @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath31 is the virial sum .",
    "since gravity acts along the vertical direction @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and the transverse degrees of freedom can be integrated out to yield the free energy functional per unit area : @xmath34}{a}\\equiv \\bar f[\\rho ] & = &   \\int_0^\\infty dz\\,\\rho(z ) \\psi_{id}(\\rho(z ) ) + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\int_0^\\infty dz\\ , \\rho(z ) \\psi_{exc}(\\rho ) + \\nonumber \\\\ & & mg\\int_0^\\infty dz\\,\\rho(z ) z,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the cross sectional area in the @xmath36 plane .",
    "minimization of the functional under the constraint eq .",
    "( 3 ) yields an equation for the density profile @xmath37 : @xmath38}{\\delta \\rho}= t\\log(\\lambda^3\\rho(z ) ) + \\psi_{exc}(\\rho ) + \\rho \\frac { d\\psi_{exc}}{d\\rho } + mgz = \\lambda\\ ] ] where we have introduced a lagrange multiplier , @xmath39 . defining @xmath40 and @xmath41 ,",
    "@xmath39 should be determined by the sum rule : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the close - packed density , @xmath5 is the number of layers of particles in the system at @xmath6 , and @xmath44 is the density at the bottom layer .",
    "note that the particular shape of the density profile will depend on the functional form of the pressure @xmath45 or , equivalently , on the functional form of the excess free energy , @xmath27 .",
    "one may use the enskog pressure for hard disks or a hard sphere equation of state given by a functional form : @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the pair correlation function evaluated at contact ( @xmath48 ) , and where @xmath49 when @xmath50 and @xmath51 when @xmath52 . then @xmath53 substituting this form of @xmath27 into eq .",
    "( 8) and taking the derivative with respect to @xmath32 generates , in our non - dimensional variables , the differential equation @xmath54,\\ ] ] which is precisely the result obtained in ref .",
    "thus the equivalence between the lda and enskog theory has been shown , and the constant @xmath7 that appears in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can also be derived by the density functional theory in the local density approximation .    to conclude this section we cite some results of the lda / enskog theory .",
    "note that for the liquid phase , the density profile @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) is a monotonically decreasing function of the height @xmath56 with its maximum value at the bottom .",
    "further , the maximum density @xmath44 is a function of temperature , too , with the upper bound @xmath57 .",
    "so , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 9 ) can be written as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "the particular form of the function @xmath60 depends on the approximation .",
    "[ 1 ] ( eq . ( 15c ) and ( 16c ) ) gives the functional forms of @xmath44 in 2d using the ree and hoover correlation function [ 11 ] @xmath61 and in 3d using the carnahan - starling equation of state : @xmath62 where we have defined the volume fraction @xmath63 in 3d and as @xmath64 in 2d .",
    "for completeness , we reproduce these .",
    "first , the 2d result : @xmath65 with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "next , the 3d result : @xmath70 where in this expression @xmath71 . note that in both 2 and 3 dimensions , @xmath60 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath44 .",
    "hence , it has a maximum at @xmath72 , the value of the close - packed density . since @xmath73 or equivalently @xmath74 and the layer thickness",
    "@xmath5 are arbitrary control parameters , the sum rule , eq .",
    "( 9 ) , breaks down when @xmath75 , where @xmath76    while the scaling of the critical temperature displayed in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is independent of the particular equation of state used in the calculation , the maximum value of @xmath60 , @xmath7 , depends on the functional form of the density profile , or equivalently , the pressure .",
    "using the two approximations above , and taking the maximum densities as @xmath77 in 3d , and @xmath78 in 2d , we find @xmath79 at the level of enskog approximation , @xmath7 is quite sensitive to the density at the bottom , @xmath44 .",
    "at this point , we find it appropriate to mention the point made by levin [ 16 ] that reliable information about the fluid - solid coexistence can not be obtained by the lda , because of its inability to include the density variations in a highly structured phase ( solid ) .",
    "when the enskog approximation breaks down , one has to either abandon the approximation and search for a better one , or modify the approximation by removing the unphysical results .",
    "in the original paper [ 1 ] , the latter approach was taken , namely based on physical grounds , the crystal regime was replaced by a constant average density , a fermi rectangle , and the fluid regime was then fit to the enskog profile , which is linked to the fermi rectangle at the liquid - solid interface . while the proportionality constant @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) obtained this way seems to overestimate , and thus while the enskog equation fails to locate the precise point of the liquid - solid transition , the prediction of its existence and the scaling relation between the critical temperature @xmath1 and external parameters ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) seem to remain true .",
    "more elaborate approximations that do take into account the local variations in the structured phase yield substantially lower values for @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which are somewhat close to the values obtained by a mean field theory [ 2 ] . in order to show the dependence of @xmath7 on approximation",
    ", we also compute in it 3d by the percus - yevick compressibility form of the equation of state : @xmath80 which yields equally high values for @xmath7 , @xmath81 the slightly different form , namely the virial form @xmath82 yields @xmath83    we further point out that the breakdown of the sum rule is due to the fact that the pressure has a singularity at @xmath84 , and thus it has a _",
    "finite _ value at the close - packed density @xmath85 , which is necessarily less than one [ 10 ] .",
    "if one uses the lattice gas pressure [ 4 ] , @xmath86 which has a singularity at @xmath87 , then the condensation temperature is zero , and the density profile is given by the fermi function [ 5 ] : @xmath88",
    "the essence of the wda , as introduced by tarazona [ 6,7 ] and curtin and ashcroft [ 8 ] is to recast eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the general form of the free energy functional , as @xmath89 & = & \\int d{\\bf{r}}\\rho({\\bf { r}})\\psi_{id}(\\rho({\\bf { r } } ) ) + \\int d{\\bf{r}}\\rho({\\bf { r}})\\psi_{exc}[\\rho_w({\\bf { r } } ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & +   \\int d{\\bf{r } } \\rho({\\bf { r } } ) u_{ext}({\\bf { r}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 $ ] is now a functional of @xmath91 , depending on @xmath91 through the weighted average of the density given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is an appropriately chosen weighting function .",
    "following tarazona [ 6 ] , we choose @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the unit step function , i.e. , we replace the local density @xmath96 with its average over a sphere of radius equal to the particle diameter @xmath4 .",
    "because we assume planar symmetry , i.e. , independence in the @xmath97 and @xmath98 directions , we may integrate out the transverse degrees of freedom and write explicitly the integral above as a one dimensional integral for @xmath99 : @xmath100 one needs to be careful near the bottom layer @xmath101 , namely , for @xmath102 . in this case",
    ", the weighting can not be done over a sphere a radius @xmath4 , because of the infinite potential at @xmath101 .",
    "we propose to carry out the weighting over that _",
    "part _ of the sphere of radius @xmath4 and centered at @xmath32 above the @xmath101 plane .",
    "thus , the normalization factor , @xmath103 , that is , the volume over which the integration is performed , is no longer @xmath104 , but instead is @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "hence , for @xmath106 , @xmath107}&\\int_0^\\infty dz ' \\rho(z ' ) ( d^2 - ( z - z')^2)\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\theta(d-|z - z'|).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as before , we need to extremize the free energy functional under the global constraint on particle number , so we again use the method of lagrange multipliers and functional differentiation . performing the minimization of the free energy functional ( eq .",
    "( 7 ) with @xmath37 in the excess term replaced by ( 28 ) ) , we find the following equation must hold : @xmath108 we write explicitly the integral term in the equation above : @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 if @xmath113 and @xmath114}\\ ] ] if @xmath115 .    the integral equation for @xmath116 , eq . ( 30 ) ,",
    "is highly nonlinear and complex .",
    "thus , it requires numerical solution .",
    "we choose to solve eq .",
    "( 30 ) using the carnahan - starling equation of state , eq .",
    "( 14 ) , so that @xmath117 for a given choice of @xmath39 we iterate eq .",
    "( 30 ) until the iteration converges to a unique profile .",
    "the integral of the profile ( eq .",
    "( 9 ) ) determines @xmath5 , effectively the depth of the unexcited sample , so for fixed @xmath118 @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath74 , we tune @xmath39 to control the number of particles .",
    "we find that at high temperatures , the profiles obtained using the wda match very well the profiles obtained for the same set of parameters using the lda / enskog approach . but as we lower the temperature of the system , particles at the bottom begin to compact themselves , and the crystallization sets in .",
    "one of the notable features of this weighted density functional approach is that formation of the crystal can be captured in the density profile , in particular oscillations in the density profile appear near @xmath119 .",
    "1a shows the development of these density peaks for a representative system at three different temperatures above @xmath1 .",
    "the peak to peak distance of this oscillation is slightly greater than the diameter of the hard sphere .",
    "1b is a closer view of the density profile for the coolest of these systems ( dotted line ) .",
    "this figure also plots the lda / enskog result for the same system ( solid line ) ; it agrees well with the wda profile for large @xmath120 , but can not reflect the rapid oscillations in density which occur near the bottom of the sample .    with sufficiently low temperature",
    ", the bottom - most peaks in the profile approach ( and even exceed ) the physical limit of @xmath121 .",
    "note that the maximum @xmath122 for close - packing in 3d is @xmath123 .",
    "however , in our numeric solution , we have chosen the lattice spacing , @xmath124 , with @xmath4 the particle diameter .",
    "this choice is to guarantee precision in the solution of the integral equation eq .",
    "hence , even though the physically relevant limit for the volume fraction @xmath122 in 3d is 0.74 , in our numerical solutions , @xmath122 must approach one at the close - packed density . with this modification",
    ", we define the temperature at which @xmath122 first reaches this physical limit at @xmath101 as the critical temperature , @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "2 , for a given set of @xmath125 , we have plotted the dimensionless critical temperature @xmath126 as a function of the initial layer thickness , @xmath5 .",
    "the numerically determined value from the slope for the constant @xmath7 is @xmath127 in 3d .",
    "we have performed an analogous wda calculation in 2d using the ree and hoover correlation function @xmath128 , eq .",
    "the data from this calculation also appear in fig .",
    "they yield @xmath129 in 2d . both the 2d and 3d wda results are smaller than those obtained by the lda / enskog approach , and we discuss this next .",
    "as we have discussed , in the lda / enskog approach , the value of @xmath7 depends on @xmath44 , the density at the bottom , and is identical to the function @xmath60 . in all the approximations",
    "we have used in this work , @xmath60 ( see eqs . ( 14 , 15 , 20 , 22 ) ) is a function very sensitive to @xmath44 for @xmath44 near close - packed values , i.e. for @xmath130 .",
    "3a illustrates this sensitive dependence .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations in two dimensions [ 12 ] have shown that @xmath44 at @xmath131 varies widely .",
    "for one set of simulations using @xmath132 hard disks with @xmath133 , defects in packing lead to @xmath44 occupying the range @xmath134 , with higher densities occuring at lower temperatures .",
    "( note that for square packing in 2d , @xmath135 , while for triangular packing , @xmath136 . ) in lda / enskog theory , this range of @xmath44 leads to @xmath137 ( the arrows in fig .",
    "3a indicate this range ) , the large range due to the sensitivity of @xmath60 , while the wda theory presented here gives a smaller value , @xmath129 for the 2d calculation using the same equation of state .",
    "though the discrepancy between the wda and lda / enskog results seems large , the source of the discrepancy is easy to identify .",
    "to do so , we first remark that any density profile derived through the wda for a given system ( @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath74 ) at temperature below @xmath1 ( wda ) differs from the lda / enskog profile for the same system appreciably only near the bottom of the sample , where the wda profile exhibits oscillations and the lda / enskog profile is a monotonically decreasing function bounded between the peaks and troughs of the wda profile ( see fig .",
    "at the temperature when the bottom - most density peak in the lda profile reaches its maximum value @xmath138 , i.e. at @xmath1 ( wda ) , the lda / enskog profile for the same system will have a much smaller maximum . in our work in 2d , at @xmath1 ( wda ) ,",
    "the lda / enskog profile has @xmath139 , below the square packing value , while in 3d , at @xmath1 ( wda ) , the lda / enskog profile has @xmath140 , below the simple cubic packing value . if we use these values to compute @xmath7 in the lda / enskog approach as in fig .",
    "3b , we get @xmath141 in 2d and @xmath142 , consistent with our determination of @xmath7 from the slopes of the lines in fig .",
    "we see then that @xmath1 ( wda ) is in general higher than @xmath1 ( lda / enskog ) for the same systems , and this is reflected in the lower value of @xmath7 in the former approach .    finally , we turn our attention to the question of whether the condensation phenomenon we are considering is a phase transition in the thermodynamic sense , i.e. , whether condensation corresponds to a discontinuity in the first or higher derivatives of the free energy with respect to temperature .",
    "we address this question by focusing on the gravitational potential energy contribution to the free energy , @xmath143 , which is proportional the center of mass @xmath144 .",
    "first we show that in the lda / enskog theory , which is extended to temperatures below @xmath1 by the assumption that the density in the frozen layers is given by @xmath145 and that the density above the frozen layers is given by a vertically shifted lda / enskog profile [ 1 ] , a kink in the center of mass develops at @xmath146 , suggesting a first order transition .    to do this we recall that the density profile @xmath55 is given by the functional form : @xmath147 where @xmath44 is the density at @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",
    "above @xmath1 , @xmath150 where @xmath151\\phi \\frac{df}{d\\phi } d\\phi\\ ] ] @xmath152 now , we note that for @xmath74 near @xmath1 : @xmath153 where @xmath154 . then for any integrand @xmath155 we can make the following approximation : @xmath156 applying this to the above expression to the integral @xmath157 and @xmath158 , we find that @xmath159 is linear in @xmath74 with a quadratic correction .",
    "below @xmath1 , the density profile develops a kink at @xmath160 . for @xmath161 , @xmath162 the close - packed density , and for @xmath163 , the profile is given by the lda / enskog profile eq . ( 37 ) , and the thickness of the frozen layer is given by [ 1 ] @xmath164 we now compute the center of mass @xmath159 : @xmath165 where @xmath166 hence , @xmath167 where @xmath168 and where @xmath169\\phi   \\frac{df(\\phi)}{d\\phi } d\\phi.\\ ] ] it therefore follows that @xmath170 where @xmath171.\\ ] ] the center of mass scales with temperature quadratically below @xmath1 but linearly just above @xmath1 ; thus , there is a kink in the center of mass and in the gravitational potential energy contribution to the free energy , giving rise to a first order transition .",
    "the scaling of @xmath172 with @xmath173 below @xmath1 survives a modification of how we represent the frozen region .",
    "suppose , the density in the frozen region is not represented by a uniform @xmath43 but is instead given by @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the position of the center of hard spheres and @xmath176 is its peak density in the i - th row forming a crystal .",
    "this is a crude way to approximate the oscillations in the density profile due to the crystallization",
    ". then , @xmath157 in eq .",
    "( 43 ) is replaced by : @xmath177 if @xmath178 for all @xmath179 , then , @xmath180   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\phi_c l^2/2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the same result as that obtained by assuming the density profile is approximated by a fermi rectangle .",
    "the wda approach to the problem also yields results suggestive of the existence of a first order phase transition .",
    "it may be an artifact of the method that in the wda solutions , as @xmath74 is lowered below @xmath1 as we have defined it , large density peaks whose maxima exceed the physical limit @xmath121 appear . thus the wda does not capture the exact distribution of material in the system .",
    "however , it is nonetheless suggestive to examine the dependence of the center of mass @xmath159 on @xmath74 .",
    "4 shows results for a representative system in 3d with @xmath181 and whose critical temperature was found to be on the range @xmath182 .",
    "an elbow , possibly a kink , is apparent in the vicinity of @xmath1 , marking the onset of near linear behavior for @xmath183 .",
    "we do not assert that this is evidence of a phase transition ; we display this data merely to suggest that the existence of such a phase transition in the wda approach is not inconsistent with our data . a different form for the weight function in eq . ( 26 )",
    "might yield a better result regarding the nature of the phase transition .",
    "we have shown that the conclusion of the original paper [ 1 ] , namely , that the scaling of the critical temperature at which hard spheres under gravity begin to form a solid is linear with their weight , their diameter , and the depth of the sample , necessarily follows from the simplest density functional theory for the problem ( the lda ) and survives a richer density functional treatment using a wda .",
    "prudence requires us to note that our wda for this problem did not include any sophisticated attempt to represent the crystal - fluid interface , something other researchers [ 13 - 15 ] working on similar problems have done .",
