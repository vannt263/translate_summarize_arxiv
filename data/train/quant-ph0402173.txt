    "over the past few years , new sources of anti - bunched light that are able to emit a single photon in a given time interval has been the subject of an intense theoretical and experimental research . the driving force behind the development of these non - classical sources is a range of novel applications in quantum information theory which builds on the laws of quantum mechanics to transmit , store , and process information in varied and powerful ways .",
    "advances in this field rely on the ability to manipulate coherently isolated quantum objects while eliminating incoherent interactions with the surrounding environment .",
    "single photon states act as elementary quantum bits ( qubits ) in quantum cryptography @xcite and teleportation of a quantum state @xcite where their entangled states enable secure transmission of information .",
    "many different types of single - photon sources have been proposed and realized using the controlled excitation of single molecules @xcite or of single nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond nanocrystals @xcite , controlled injection of carriers into a mesoscopic quantum well @xcite and using pulsed excitation of semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .    in the context of cavity qed ,",
    "single - photon fock states have been produced by a rabi @xmath0-pulse in a microwave cavity @xcite and by the stirap technique in an optical cavity @xcite based on the scheme proposed in @xcite where the stokes pulse is replaced by a mode of a high - q cavity .",
    "the stirap process has also been studied in a system of four - level atom interacting with a cavity mode and two laser pulses , with a coupling scheme which generates two degenerate dark states @xcite . in all these cavity qed schemes",
    "one atom interacts with a single - mode high - q cavity and generates one photon . as the atoms pass through the cavity one by one , more photons",
    "can be added to the cavity . recently",
    "another scheme has been proposed to generate a two - photon fock state by a single two - level atom interacting with a superconducting cavity which sustains two non - degenerate orthogonally polarized modes @xcite .",
    "the photons are transferred from the source mode into the target mode of the cavity by a third - order raman process .",
    "however this scheme is not robust relative to the velocity of atoms .    in this paper",
    "we propose a scheme in which a two - level atom interacts counterintuitively @xcite with a single - mode high - q cavity and a delayed maser field that are both near - resonant with the atomic transition , allowing to produce a controlled number of photons in the cavity depending on the design of the adiabatic passage . this process is referred to as a bichromatic adiabatic passage since two near - resonant interacting fields act on a single transition .",
    "a related work involving exchange of photons between two laser fields through a bichromatic process can be found in ref .",
    "the transfer of photons from the maser field into the cavity field is based on the adiabatic passage between two dressed states which are the eigenstates of the coupled atom - maser - cavity system .",
    "this process is robust because it does not depend on the precise velocity of the atom or on the precise tuning of the maser and the cavity frequencies .",
    "the dynamics of the process , under the adiabatic conditions , can be described completely by the topology of the dressed eigenenergy surfaces .",
    "this topological aspect is the key to the robustness of the process .",
    "our method is based on the calculation of the dressed eigenenergy surfaces of the effective hamiltonian as a function of the two rabi frequencies associated to the maser and the cavity fields , and the application of adiabatic principles to determine the dynamics of the process in view of the topology of the surfaces .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we use the floquet formalism and the phase representation of the creation and annihilation operators to construct the effective hamiltonian of the atom - maser - cavity system .",
    "eigenenergy surfaces of the effective hamiltonian are displayed in sec .",
    "iii as a function of the normalized rabi frequencies of the cavity and the maser fields .",
    "we demonstrate how the analysis of these surfaces allows to design different adapted adiabatic paths leading to different photon transfers into the cavity field without changing the atomic population at the end of the interaction .",
    "iv is devoted to the numerical simulation of the evolution governed by the effective hamiltonian and the final probabilities of the one and two - photon transfer states . finally , in sec .",
    "v we give some conclusions and indicate conditions for experimental implementation .",
    "we consider a two - level atom of upper and lower states @xmath1 and @xmath2 and of energy difference @xmath3 as represented in fig .",
    "1 . we use atomic units in which @xmath4 .",
    "the atom in its lower state is released from a source of atoms and falls through a high - q cavity with velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the atom first encounters the vacuum mode of the cavity with frequency @xmath6 and waist @xmath7 and then the maser beam with frequency @xmath8 and waist @xmath9 .",
    "both the maser and the cavity fields are near - resonant with the atomic transition .",
    "the distance between the crossing points of the cavity and the maser axis with the atomic trajectory is @xmath10 .",
    "the travelling atom encounters time dependent and delayed rabi frequencies of the cavity and the maser fields : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are respectively the dipole moment of the atomic transition , the effective volume of the cavity mode and the amplitude of the maser field .    [ level ]    the detuning of the maser and the cavity fields from the atomic transition are @xmath15 .",
    "we take the frequencies of the fields such that their difference @xmath16 is positive and very small with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "also we assume @xmath17 under these conditions , the counter - rotating terms can be discarded in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "the semiclassical hamiltonian of the atom - maser - cavity system can thus be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the annihilation and creation operators of the cavity field , @xmath20 is the @xmath21 identity matrix and the phase @xmath22 is the initial phase of the maser field .",

    "the dynamics of system is determined by the schrdinger equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 with initial condition @xmath32 .",

    "the fast periodic time - dependence can be taken into account by use of floquet theory .",
    "the evolution equation in the floquet representation reads : @xmath36 where @xmath37 appears as a dynamical variable defined on the unit circle @xmath38 of length @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the floquet hamiltonian @xmath41 the only time dependence of the floquet hamiltonian is from the slow variation of the field amplitudes .",

    "@xmath55 is the basis function @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "we remark that if at the end of interaction @xmath58 , the solution of ( [ dyn2 ] ) has a form @xmath59 then the probability for the solution of ( [ dyn1 ] ) to be found in the final states @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 , will not depend on the phase @xmath62 of the semiclassical hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the evolution of ( [ dyn2 ] ) due to slow field amplitudes will be treated in the enlarged hilbert space by adiabatic principles .",
    "we first show that the dynamics of ( [ fham ] ) under the bichromatic interaction can be described by an effective hamiltonian .",
    "we start by applying to the floquet hamiltonian ( [ fham ] ) the unitary transformation @xmath63 which yields @xmath64 the third term of @xmath65 , denoted @xmath66 , is the so - called rwa hamiltonian , associated to the maser field and the atom .",

    "defining the new variables @xmath72 we have @xmath73 the eigenbasis of ( @xmath74 ) is @xmath75 which can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 . substituting ( [ newpartial ] ) in ( [ kphase ] ) gives @xmath78 we can define new operators as @xmath79 which verify the standard commutation relations @xmath80=1 $ ] .",
    "the new bosonic operator @xmath81 that corresponds to the process of creation of a cavity photon and associated annihilation of a maser photon , can be intuitively interpreted as the transformation of a maser photon into a cavity photon .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ knewphase ] ) can thus be expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the reduced effective hamiltonian @xmath84 @xmath65 is defined on the hilbert space generated by the orthonormal basis @xmath85 and @xmath83 is defined on the hilbert space generated by the orthonormal basis @xmath86 where @xmath29 is the number of exchanged photons from the maser field into the cavity field .",
    "the dressed eigenenergy surfaces of @xmath65 ( [ kb ] ) can be calculated numerically and can be displayed as a function of the normalized rabi frequencies @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "these surfaces are grouped in families for different values of @xmath89 , each of which for zero fields consists an infinite set of eigenvalues with equal spacing @xmath90 . in what follows ,",
    "we study the @xmath91 family only which means @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the relative photon number of the maser field and @xmath94 is the photon number of the cavity field ) .",
    "the labelling of the dressed eigenenergy surfaces can be performed in terms of the eigenvectors of the zero - field original hamiltonian , @xmath95 with eigenvalues @xmath96 since the eigenvectors of @xmath97 and @xmath65 are related by the transformation ( [ rm ] ) as @xmath98 , the correspondence between the eigenvalues of the zero - field effective hamiltonian and the eigenvectors of the original zero - field hamiltonian are @xmath99    figure 2 represents the @xmath91 family of the eigenenergy surfaces of @xmath65 as function of the instantaneous normalized rabi frequencies @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "any two neighboring surfaces have conical intersections on the plane @xmath100 and also on the plane @xmath101 ( except the first surface ) , corresponding to the situations where only one of the fields ( maser or cavity ) is interacting with the atom .",
    "the topology of these surfaces , determined by the conical intersections , presents insight into the various atomic population and photon transfers from the maser field into the cavity field that can be produced by designing an appropriate path connecting the initial and the the chosen final states .",
    "each path corresponds to a choice of the envelope of the pulses . in the adiabatic limit ,",
    "when the pulses vary sufficiently slowly , the solution of the time - dependent dressed schrdinger equation follows the instantaneous dressed eigenvectors , following the path on the surface that is continuously connected to the initial state .",
    "we start with the dressed state @xmath102 , i.e. , the lower atomic state with zero photons in the cavity field .",
    "its energy is shown in fig .",
    "2 as the starting point of the various paths .",
    "the paths shown in fig . 2 describe accurately the dynamics if the time dependence of the envelopes is slow enough according to the landau - zener @xcite and dykhne - davis - pechukas @xcite analysis . if two ( uncoupled ) eigenvalues cross , the adiabatic theorem of born and fock @xcite shows that the dynamics follows diabatically the crossing .",
    "this implies that the various dynamics shown in fig .",

    "figure 2 shows two examples of the adiabatic paths of different peak amplitudes of the rabi frequencies and leading to two different photon transfers into the cavity field without changing the atomic population at the end of the interaction .",
    "each of the two black paths ( labelled ( a ) and ( b ) ) corresponds to a sequence of two smooth pulses , shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( c ) , of equal length @xmath112 and different peak rabi frequencies @xmath113 , separated by a delay such that the cavity pulse interacts before the maser pulse .",
    "for the path ( a ) , the dynamics goes through the first intersection ( on the @xmath101 plane ) between the first and the second surfaces , but not the second intersection between the second and the third surface .",
    "the crossing of the first intersection as @xmath103 increases with @xmath101 , brings the dressed system into the second eigenenergy surface .",
    "turning on and increasing the amplitude @xmath104 ( while @xmath103 decreases ) moves the path across this surface . when the maser field decreases , the curve crosses another intersection between the second and the third surface ( with @xmath100 ) that brings the system to the third surface , on which the path ( a ) stays until the end of the pulse @xmath104 .",
    "the transfer state is finally connected to the state @xmath107 : there is no final transfer of atomic population , but one @xmath8 photon has been absorbed from the maser field and one @xmath6 photon has been emitted into the cavity field at the end of the process .",
    "the path ( b ) allows the dynamics ( on the @xmath101 plane ) to go through the second intersection , but not the third intersection .",
    "the next two intersections of the path ( b ) are located ( on the plane @xmath100 ) between the third and the fourth and between the fourth and the fifth eigenenergy surfaces and the system is finally connected to the state @xmath108 : there is again no final transfer of atomic population , but two @xmath8 photons have been absorbed from the maser field and two @xmath6 photons have been emitted into the cavity field at the end of the process .",
    "if the peak amplitudes are taken even larger such that @xmath29 conical intersections ( dynamical resonances ) are crossed when @xmath103 rises with @xmath101 and then @xmath29 intersection are crossed when @xmath104 decreases with @xmath100 , the final state of the system will be @xmath114 , i.e. , the emission of @xmath115 photons into the cavity field and the absorbtion of @xmath116 photons from the maser field , with no final atomic population transfer .",
    "+    the analysis of the eigenenergy surfaces allows one to determine adapted amplitudes of the rabi frequencies which will permit to transfer @xmath29 photons into the cavity field in a robust way .",

    "this figure shows that the bichromatic adiabatic passage is more robust with respect to the maser rabi frequency than with respect to the cavity one .",
    "the reason comes back to the special structure of the dressed eigenenergy surfaces in fig .",
