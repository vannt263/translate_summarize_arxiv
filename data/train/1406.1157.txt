    "the age and mass distributions of a population of star clusters provide important clues to their formation and disruption .",
    "recent studies of the cluster populations in nearby star - forming galaxies have suggested that the observed distributions are dominated by the disruption , rather than the formation , of the clusters .",
    "some physical processes , for example the evaporation of stars due to two - body relaxation , are known to disrupt low - mass clusters earlier than high - mass clusters , thereby imprinting features ( such as a bend ) on the mass and age distributions .",
    "other processes are believed to operate ( approximately ) independently of the mass of the clusters , preserving the shape of the mass function over time and that of the age distribution at different masses ( e.g. , fall & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "there are still relatively few galaxies with well determined cluster mass and age distributions .",
    "furthermore , the results from different groups working on the same galaxy have not yet converged . some studies ( e.g. , whitmore et  al .",
    "2007 , fall et  al .",
    "2009 , fall & chandar 2012 ) advocate a `` quasi - universal '' model for cluster populations in star - forming galaxies , where the shapes of the cluster mass and age distributions are independent of one another , because clusters are disrupted at a rate that is approximately independent of their mass .",
    "other studies ( e.g. , boutloukos & lamers 2003 , bastian et  al .  2012 ) suggest that there is a characteristic timescale for cluster disruption processes that depends on the mass of the clusters , and this timescale depends strongly on the local environment .",
    "the motivation for this work is three - fold : to empirically determine the age and mass distributions of star clusters in the nearby spiral galaxy m83 , to understand how the selection of the clusters affects the results , and to test whether or not clusters are disrupted at a rate that depends on their mass .",
    "we use multi - band observations of two fields in m83 , taken as part of our program go-11360 , for this purpose .",
    "these images were observed with the wfc3 camera on - board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "we present new cluster catalogs selected using different methods and compare with catalogs previously published by chandar et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) and bastian et  al .",
    "the cluster age and mass distributions observed in each field are then compared with predictions from mass - dependent and mass - independent disruption models .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 summarizes the observations and photometry , describes the selection procedures used to create the various star cluster catalogs , and explores the similarities and differences between these catalogs .",
    "this section also summarizes the method used to determine the ages and masses of the clusters .",
    "section  3 presents the age and mass distributions of the clusters in the two fields in m83 using all of the cluster catalogs .",
    "section  4 discusses the implications of the mass - age results from the two fields for the formation and disruption of the clusters .",
    "we summarize the main results of this work in section  5 .",
    "multi - band images of two @xmath12  kpc@xmath13 portions of m83 were taken with the wfc3 on _ hst _ , one covering the nucleus ( inner field ) and presented previously in chandar et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and a second pointing to the north ( outer field ) .",
    "these observations were taken as part of the early release science program  1 ( go-11360 ; pi : oconnell ) . in this work ,",
    "we use observations taken in five filters , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 ( inner field ) or @xmath19 ( outer field ) ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , and @xmath23 ( h@xmath24 ) .",
    "three or four separate exposures were taken at slightly offset positions for each filter , in order to improve the spatial resolution .",
    "figure  1 shows color images of each field .",
    "the flat - fielded wfc3/uvis images in each filter were co - added using the multidrizzle task ( koekemoer et  al .",
    "2002 ) , with a final pixel scale of @xmath25  pixel@xmath26 .",
    "these reduced images are available at : http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/wfc3ers/m83datalist.html .",
    "as before , we assume a distance of @xmath27  mpc to m83 ( thim et  al .",
    "2003 ) , corresponding to a distance modulus of @xmath28 , and a pixel scale of @xmath29  pc  pixel@xmath26 .",
    "detection and photometry of the sources in the data were performed as described in chandar et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) . in order to detect as many sources as possible , we aligned and co - added together the final , drizzled broad - band images in the @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath21 filters , normalized by the typical rms in each image .",
    "this results in a  white - light \" image which gives approximately equal weight to the different filters .",
    "this procedure allows us to include objects in our source list that are very blue or very red , such as blue and red supergiant stars , that otherwise might not be detectable in any given filter .",
    "we identified all sources , both point - like and slightly extended , using the iraf task daofind on a median - divided white light image ( see discussion in miller 1997 ) .",
    "this initial source catalog contains individual stars , close blends of a pair or a few stars , star clusters , and background galaxies .",
    "we perform circular aperture photometry of all detected sources on the drizzled images for each filter using the iraf task phot with an aperture radius of 3  pixels and a background annulus between 10 and 13  pixels .",
    "for the narrow - band f657n ( h@xmath24 ) image , we perform photometry on the original image without subtracting the stellar continuum flux .",
    "aperture corrections were made based on the measured size of each cluster , using the formula given in chandar et  al .",
    "we convert the instrumental magnitudes to the vegamag magnitude system by applying the following zeropoints : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , which are provided by stsci at the following url : http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/phot/zp/lbn",
    ". we will loosely refer to these as `` @xmath15,''``@xmath17 , '' `` @xmath20 , '' `` h@xmath24 , '' and `` @xmath22''-band magnitudes , although we do not make any transformations to the johnson - cousins system .",
    "one of the goals of this work is to assess the impact that the method used to select stellar clusters has on the resulting mass and age distributions .",
    "bastian et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) discussed the impact of selection by comparing their results with those presented in chandar et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) for the inner field , but this is the first time that such a comparison has been made for the outer field in m83 .",
    "there are three methods of cluster selection that are discussed below : ( 1 )  fully automated selection based on criteria that find objects that are slightly broader than the psf , followed by minimization of blends using algorithms discussed in chandar et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , ( 2 )  fully manual selection , based on a detailed by - eye examination of the sources within the images to assess if they are broader than the psf ( chandar et  al .",
    "2010 ) , and ( 3 )  a `` hybrid '' method where contaminants are rejected based on visual inspection after generating an automated catalog ( bastian et  al .",
    "while automatic methods are preferred in terms of repeatability and objectivity , these methods often have difficulty distinguishing close pairs of stars from resolved star clusters , especially in crowded regions .",
    "although manual methods are subjective in nature , they have the advantage that each candidate is examined individually .",
    "we find many cases which are easily classified by eye but incorrectly identified by automated techniques ( e.g. , a diffuse cluster with a very nearby star or diffraction spikes from saturated stars ) .",
    "for these reasons , we construct both manual and automatic catalogs , and use the differences between them to help estimate uncertainties in the resulting mass and age distributions .",
    "one of the key differences between the bastian et  al .",
    "selection and ours is that they attempt to make a distinction between bound and unbound clusters , by eliminating sources that are asymmetric or do not have a strong central concentration .",
    "effectively , this eliminates mostly very young @xmath35  yr clusters , such as source 5652 in figure  2 , which is slightly asymmetric , but appears to be a bonafide , compact star cluster .",
    "we do not attempt to make a distinction between bound and unbound clusters based on morphology , since it is not possible to tell from the appearance of a cluster whether it has positive or negative total ( potential plus kinetic ) energy ( e.g. , baumgardt & kroupa 2007 ) .",
    "even with velocity dispersion measurements made from high resolution spectroscopy it is difficult to determine if a cluster is bound or unbound .    in this work ,",
    "we use six catalogs of compact star clusters , three each in the inner and outer fields , selected using the methods described above .",
    "the total number of clusters in each catalog are : _",
    "( i ) _ * manual : * @xmath9490 inner field , @xmath9530 outer field ; _ ( ii ) _ * automatic : * @xmath9660 inner field , @xmath9720 outer field ; and _ ( iii ) _ * hybrid : * @xmath9460 inner field , @xmath9480 outer field .",
    "the top panel of figure  2 compares the three cluster catalogs in the portion of the outer field outlined in figure  1 .",
    "this figure shows several interesting results .",
    "our automatic catalog misses very diffuse clusters , and includes as clusters some questionable sources in the most crowded regions . our manual catalog appears to do significantly better , but it is subjective and therefore difficult to assess completeness quantitatively .",
    "the bastian et al .",
    "catalog has few sources in crowded regions , and appears to go deeper in regions of low background .",
    "the lists of cluster candidates in this area agree at about the 4070% level , similar to the @xmath960% level of agreement found by bastian et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) for the catalogs covering the inner field .",
    "the reader is referred to whitmore et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) for more detailed discussion , including a comparison with a fourth catalog obtained using automatic criteria on hubble legacy archive ( http://hla.stsci.edu ) source lists , which also agrees at roughly the 60% level . the key question , however , is whether or not these different cluster catalogs based on different selection criteria yield strongly different mass and age distributions .      figure  3 compares the @xmath36 vs.  @xmath37 colors measured for the clusters in each catalog with predictions from the twice solar metallicity stellar population models of charlot & bruzual ( 2009 ; hereafter cb09 , private communication ; see also bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "the model predictions , shown as the solid line , cover the age range from @xmath38 to @xmath39  yr , starting from the upper left .",
    "the measured colors match the model predictions fairly well , despite the fact that no correction has been made for any reddening due to dust .",
    "reddening of individual clusters will ` smear ' out the distribution along the indicated vector .",
    "we see that the distributions in color - color space are similar amongst all three catalogs , which show a higher relative concentration of clusters with blue colors in the inner field than in the outer field .",
    "we estimate the age @xmath40 , extinction @xmath41 , and the mass for each cluster as we have done in previous works ( see e.g. , fall et  al .",
    "2005 ; chandar et  al .",
    "2010 for details ) , by comparing the observed and predicted @xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath20 , @xmath22 , and h@xmath24 magnitudes .",
    "we perform a @xmath42 fit to the predictions from the cb09 stellar population models with solar metallicity . the narrow - band h@xmath24 filter contains both stellar continuum and nebular line emission , allowing us to include it directly in the fit for clusters of all ages .",
    "the mass of each cluster is estimated from the extinction - corrected @xmath20 band luminosity , assuming a galactic extinction law ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) , and the age - dependent mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath43 predicted by the cb09 models .",
    "we assume a chabrier ( 2003 ) initial stellar mass function ; if we had adopted the salpeter ( 1955 ) rather than the chabrier imf , the @xmath44 and hence the estimated masses would increase by a near constant @xmath940% .",
    "we note that the predictions from the bc09 models assume that the stellar imf for each cluster is fully sampled .",
    "the colors of clusters with masses below @xmath910@xmath45 begin to spread significantly around these predicted models , because the upper end of the stellar imf within these clusters are not fully populated .",
    "these stochastic fluctuations in the number of massive stars can lead to variations in the intrinsic optical colors of clusters with similar ages ( and masses ) . however , fouesneau et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that the resulting age and mass distributions are similar for clusters more massive than a few @xmath46 regardless of whether the observed colors are compared with fully sampled or stochastic model predictions .",
    "using this as a guideline , we use @xmath9@xmath47 as a lower limit for our analysis .",
    "in figure  4 we show the log  @xmath48-log@xmath40 diagrams for the different cluster catalogs in the inner ( upper panels ) and outer ( lower panels ) fields observed in m83 .",
    "the method used to determine the cluster masses and ages for the catalogs presented here is described in section  2.3 .",
    "we do not rederive the masses and ages of clusters in the bastian et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) catalogs , but use their values directly .    the solid ( approximately ) diagonal line in each panel shows predictions for a @xmath49 cluster in the mass - age plane , and is a reasonable estimate of the magnitude limit of our cluster catalogs .",
    "a comparison of the results shows that , at least qualitatively , the three different catalogs provide similar distributions in the inner and outer fields .",
    "the @xmath50 diagrams show that clusters in our fields have formed with a continuous range of ages from @xmath9@xmath38 to @xmath39  yr .",
    "the diagrams also show a number of small - scale features , with gaps at some ages and apparent over - densities of clusters at other ages .",
    "these types of features are expected when estimating ages by comparing observed cluster spectral energy distributions with predicted stellar evolution models , because the predicted colors loop back on themselves , creating a fairly small range in the predicted shapes of the spectral energy distributions over a relatively large age span , resulting in gaps and other small - scale artifacts .",
    "these small - scale features do not however , affect the broad distribution of cluster masses and ages in a significant way ( e.g. , fouesneau et  al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the cluster age distribution , @xmath51 , provides important information about the formation and disruption of the clusters .",
    "we determine this distribution by simply counting clusters above a given mass limit , in equal size bins of log  @xmath40 .",
    "the age distributions determined from each cluster catalog are plotted for two different ranges of mass , selected to stay above the approximate magnitude limit shown by the diagonal fading track , and also to masses higher than log  @xmath52 ( where stochastic fluctuations do not have a significant affect on the distributions ; see section  2.3 ) . in order to make a fair comparison between all three catalogs ,",
    "we do not plot clusters younger than 10  myr in this particular diagram , * since the bastian et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) catalogs are likely incomplete at these very young ages .",
    "* we will present the age distributions of clusters over the entire age range for all seven fields observed in m83 in a future work .",
    "we use a typical bin width of @xmath90.40.5 in log  @xmath40 in order to have a sufficient number of bins , at the expense of being able to fully bin over gaps and other small - scale features resulting from the age dating procedure .",
    "figure  5 shows the resulting age distributions for two different mass - limited samples determined for each catalog .",
    "each age distribution has a steadily declining shape , with no obvious bends or other features , except possibly for @xmath35  yr in a few cases .",
    "the shapes of the cluster age distributions in each field are approximately the same for both plotted intervals of mass .",
    "this indicates that the age distribution is independent of the mass of the clusters , at least over the range studied here .",
    "the age distributions can be approximated by power laws of the form @xmath1 .",
    "we perform a least squares fit to log@xmath53log@xmath54 const , and present the best fit values of @xmath55 in figure  5 and compile them in table  1 .",
    "the age distributions determined from the different catalogs of the inner field are all similar , with a mean @xmath56 .",
    "the outer field distributions give a mean of @xmath57 .",
    "if we include clusters younger than 10  myr , we find slightly steeper values for @xmath55 in both fields ( for the inner field , see results presented in chandar et  al .  2010 ) .",
    "the relative age distributions can be affected by differences in the star formation histories between the two fields , as also pointed out by bastian et  al .",
    "( 2009 , 2012 ) .",
    "we make a first attempt to correct for this difference by using the relative star formation rates for the inner and outer m83 fields determined by silva - villa et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) from an analysis of the colors and luminosities of individual stars in _",
    "hst_/acs observations taken at somewhat different locations within m83 , and presented in figure  11 of bastian et  al .  ( 2012 ) .",
    "this figure shows that the star formation rate in the inner field is approximately a factor of three higher than in the outer field between the ages of log@xmath587.6 , but that this ratio appears to decline to a factor of 2 at an age of log@xmath59 . making a simple relative correction of log  @xmath60 to @xmath55 would result in the @xmath55 values in the two fields becoming more similar , with @xmath61 .",
    "however , given the large uncertainties in the determination of the relative star formation histories between the two fields over the studied range of ages , it is also possible that there is little difference between the two .",
    "hence , we bracket the difference in @xmath55 between the two fields to be within the range @xmath62 .    in order to assess whether or not this is a statistically significant difference , we need to estimate the uncertainties on the values of @xmath55 .",
    "previous experiments have shown that the _ absolute _ uncertainty is typically 0.2 ( e.g. , chandar et  al .  2010 ; fouesneau et  al .",
    "however , we are more interested here in the _ relative _ uncertainties rather than the absolute ones . in this case",
    ", many of the systematic differences , which dominate the absolute uncertainties ( e.g. , use of different model predictions , age dating methods , etc ) , tend to cancel out .",
    "other systematic differences , such as those in the relative star formation histories between the two fields , will still be present .",
    "the scatter between the six different fit values in table  1 for each field is @xmath90.10 , and the error in the mean is therefore @xmath90.04 ( i.e. , scatter/@xmath63 ) .",
    "this is probably an underestimate , however , because the cluster samples are not fully independent but overlap by @xmath960% , and so dividing by @xmath63 is not fully justified .",
    "any difference in star formation history between the two fields will introduce an additional uncertainty .",
    "the true relative error is likely to be somewhere between 0.04 and 0.20 , and we adopt the average value of @xmath90.12 , which is similar to the scatter in the mean , as the uncertainty . * any difference in the age distribution between the inner and outer fields is therefore tentative . *",
    "the addition of five more fields recently observed with _",
    "( proposal = 12513 , pi = blair ) will provide a more definitive test in the future .",
    "the shape of the cluster mass function , @xmath64 , is one of the key diagnostics of whether cluster disruption is dependent or independent of mass .",
    "we determine these distributions by counting clusters in different intervals of age , and restricting the low mass end to stay above the magnitude limit shown in figure  4 .",
    "the specific age intervals are : ( 1 ) log  @xmath657.0 ( blue ) , ( 2 ) log  @xmath588.0 ( green ) , and ( 3 ) log  @xmath598.6 ( red ) . because the small - scale features observed in the mass - age diagram have less impact on the mass function , we plot @xmath64 using equal numbers of clusters in each bin of log  @xmath48 . in chandar et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) we showed that the particular method of binning , whether equal in width or in cluster number , only affects the value of @xmath66 at the @xmath67 level , smaller than the actual uncertainties .",
    "figure  6 shows the mass functions resulting from the three different catalogs ( our manual , our automatic , and bastian et  al .",
    "hybrid ) for both the inner ( upper panels ) and outer ( lower panels ) fields , in the three different intervals of age listed above .",
    "each of these distributions can be well - represented by a simple power - law .",
    "we perform fits of the form log  @xmath68  log  m + const , show the best fit as the solid line in each figure , and record the value of @xmath66 in table  2 .",
    "the inner field mass functions have a mean of @xmath69 , and the outer field distributions give @xmath70 .",
    "absolute uncertainties for @xmath66 , based on experiments with different age dating methods , filter sets , binning , etc .",
    "are @xmath71 ( see chandar et  al .",
    "the scatter between the nine different fit values in table  2 is 0.20 for the inner field and 0.39 for the outer , and the uncertainty in the means are 0.07 and 0.13 , respectively . for the uncertainty in @xmath66 for each field",
    ", we adopt the mean value between the scatter and the uncertainty in the mean , resulting in @xmath72 for the inner field and @xmath73 in the outer .",
    "if the most discrepant value of @xmath66 ( i.e. lower - right panel in figure  6 ) in the outer field is excluded , we find @xmath66 of @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , while the mass function may be somewhat steeper in the outer field when compared with the inner field , this result is only significant at the @xmath91@xmath75 level .",
    "just as for the inner field , we find no significant change in the shape of the cluster mass function in the outer field when going from youngest to oldest .",
    "_ this is one of our key results , that the shapes of the cluster mass functions in both the inner and outer fields are similar at different ages , and show no systematic flattening , particularly at the low mass end , from youngest to oldest . _ in order to better demonstrate this result , we show the mass functions normalized to lie on top of one another in figure  7 .",
    "this figure shows clearly that , although different ranges of mass are plotted in each age interval , the shapes are essentially the same within the uncertainties , and the oldest ( red ) clusters at the low mass end do not fall below the dashed lines .",
    "perhaps the strongest deviation in shape is the slightly steeper slope for the oldest clusters in the upper two left panels ( red points in figure  7 ) .",
    "we note that this is opposite to the trend predicted by a short disruption time scale inferred for the inner field by bastian et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , as will be discussed further in  4.3 .",
    "we also note that the intermediate interval of age , log  @xmath768 , particularly in the outer field for our manual and the bastian catalogs , appear to be somewhat flatter than in the other age ranges .",
    "this effect may be related to the age - dating artifact mentioned in section  3.1 .",
    "bastian et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggested that the cluster mass function in the two fields is inconsistent with a simple power - law , rather that it requires a schechter - like cutoff at the high mass end , where @xmath77 . in order to assess whether or not this is the case",

    "the mass functions for clusters in the inner field , shown in figure  6 , are quite consistent with a pure power - law in all three catalogs . in the outer field",

    "we find similar results to the binned case , that the simulated and observed cumulative mass functions match well , if values of @xmath66 similar to those compiled in table  2 are used .",
    "the one exception is the mass function for 100400  myr clusters in the outer field , which appears to be slightly deficient in massive clusters .",

    "they have also used a different interval of cluster ages , from 3100 myr , than in their subsequent analysis ( e.g. , in their figure  17 ) , incompleteness in their cluster catalog below ages of 10  myr may , however , bias their result . in any case , the number of clusters involved is only a few out of a sample of a few hundred .",
    "there are currently two popular models being discussed in the literature for the disruption of star clusters over the first approximately a few hundred million years of their lives , one where lower mass clusters are disrupted earlier than their higher mass counterparts ( mass - dependent disruption  e.g . ,",
    "bastian et  al .",
    "2012 ) and one where clusters disrupt at approximately the same rate , regardless of their mass ( mass - independent disruption  e.g . , fall & chandar 2012 ) .",
    "the models make different predictions for the shape of the age distribution in different intervals of mass and for the mass function in different intervals of age .",
    "basic predictions from each model are summarized below , and then compared with the observed mass - age distributions of star clusters in our two m83 fields .    in gradual , mass - dependent disruption ( mdd ) models ( e.g. , boutloukos & lamers 2003 ; fall et  al .",
    "2010 ) , clusters lose mass at approximately the same rate , leading to the earlier disruption of lower mass clusters when compared with their higher mass counterparts .",
    "this model predicts ` breaks ' or curvature in the mass ( and age ) distributions for a population of clusters . in this model",
    "the disruption time @xmath81 has been characterized as @xmath82 , where the exponent @xmath83 and characteristic disruption timescale @xmath84 are adjustable parameters , and @xmath85 is a fiducial mass scale ( lamers et  al .  2005 ; fall et  al .",
    "we first assume that the initial shape of the mass function is a power - law , and that clusters form at a constant rate .",
    "mass - dependent disruption models predict that the cluster age distribution ( for mass - limited samples , as presented here ) , will be flat at young ages , but then fall off exponentially at an age that reflects the characteristic disruption time .",
    "this behavior should occur at all mass ranges , but the break point will occur at younger ages for lower mass clusters .",

    "( 2009 ) for graphical examples of these predictions .",
    "the predicted behavior of the mass function is similar if the initial shape is a schechter function rather than a power - law ; an example is shown in figure  8 . for both assumed initial distributions , _ a critical prediction of mass - dependent disruption models is the flattening of the mass function at older ages and lower masses . _    in the gradual , mass - independent disruption model the two distributions are independent of one another , and can be written as : @xmath86 .",

    "figure  7 shows this explicitly , i.e. the red squares , showing 100400  myr - old clusters , do not deviate below the younger age populations ( green triangles and blue circles ) at masses around and below @xmath92 .",
    "this is true regardless of whether or not there is a downturn at the high mass end .",
    "therefore , any dependence of the disruption rate of the clusters on their mass , if it exists , is too weak to be observed , even with the high quality observations taken with the _",
    "hst_. _ we conclude that the m83 clusters studied here , in both the inner and outer fields , do not show evidence for mass - dependent disruption over the observed @xmath93 domain . _    next , we compare our observed age and mass distributions with predictions from the mass-_independent _ disruption model .",
    "the observed mass and age distributions in both fields are _ consistent _ with predictions from this model , i.e. , the age distributions are well described by a single power law that is approximately independent of cluster mass , and the mass function can be described by a power - law that is approximately independent of the age of the clusters .",
    "the main difference in the results between the two fields is in the exponent @xmath55 , * with the inner field having @xmath87 to @xmath88 * and the outer field having @xmath94 . adopting realistic uncertainties and bracketing a range of possible differences in the relative star formation histories between the two fields ( from no difference to the maximum suggested by figure  11 in bastian et  al . ) , we find that the exponents only differ at the @xmath92@xmath91 level , as discussed in section  3.2 .",
    "we also note that a @xmath55 value of @xmath95 still indicates strong cluster disruption , with @xmath970% of clusters disrupting every decade in age ( i.e. , ( 1@xmath96 ) , not very different from the approximately 8090% disruption suggested by chandar et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , or found in this paper for the inner field ( i.e. , ( 1@xmath97 ) .",
    "our results are quite similar , in most regards , to those found by bastian et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and are now supported by the addition of two cluster catalogs in each field selected using different methods .",
    "both groups find similar looking color - color diagrams ( figure  3 ) , similar mass - age diagrams ( figure  4 ) , and similar age and mass distributions ( figures 57 ) , except for some differences at @xmath35  yr , as expected due to differences in the selection criteria ( see section  2.2 here and bastian et  al .",
    "both groups agree that mass - independent disruption provides a reasonable description of the data , and that mass - dependent disruption models that assume an initial power - law mass function do _ not _ fit the data well .",
    "the biggest area of disagreement is the contention by bastian et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) that mass - dependent disruption models that assume an initial schechter mass function _ can _ also fit the data .",
    "when they perform a two - dimensional fit to clusters in the @xmath50 plane , they derive the specific values for @xmath84 and @xmath79 of 160  myr and @xmath98 in the inner field , and 600  myr and @xmath99 in the outer field . in figure",
    "[ fig : dndlogm_datamod ] we compare the observed mass functions of 100400  myr clusters in both fields with predictions from the bastian et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) mass - dependent disruption model .",
    "the panels on the left show the predicted evolution assuming their best fit model parameters in each field .",
    "the blue dashed lines show the initial schechter mass function , the green dotted and red solid lines show the predicted evolution for 10100  myr and 100400  myr cluster populations , respectively .",
    "the shorter disruption time @xmath84 in the top - left panel leads to faster evolution and more flattening at the low mass end of the cluster mass function when compared with the bottom - left panel .",
    "the panels on the right in figure  [ fig : dndlogm_datamod ] compare the observed mass function for 100400  myr clusters with the model predictions . here , we have allowed the flexibility of renormalizing the predicted 100400  myr distribution to best match the shape of the observed distribution , by matching the predictions and observations at the high mass end .",
    "however , even with this added degree of flexibility , the specific mass - dependent disruption model and parameters suggested by bastian et  al .  ( 2012 ) do not provide a good match to the observations , i.e. , the red curves are clearly flatter at the low mass end than the observed ones .",
    "in fact , the initial schechter function ( blue curve ) , which represents no mass - dependent disruption , provides a much better fit to the observations .",
    "therefore , mass - dependent disruption can not have much affect on the observed @xmath50 ranges of the cluster population in these two fields of m83 .",
    "any mass - dependent disruption , if it exists , must occur below the selection limits of these catalogs .",
    "in this paper we determined the mass and age distributions of star clusters detected in two fields observed with the _ hst_/wfc3 in the nearby spiral galaxy m83 , and compared them with predictions from two different models of cluster disruption .",
    "we used three distinct catalogs in each field for this purpose , including one from the previously published work by bastian et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) , where the clusters were selected using different methods and criteria . in each case , integrated _ ubvi _",
    "h@xmath24 photometric measurements were compared with predictions from population synthesis models in order to estimate the age ( @xmath40 ) and mass ( @xmath48 ) for each cluster .",
    "we found that the age and mass distributions , @xmath51 and @xmath64 , of the clusters in each field did not differ significantly amongst the catalogs , particularly for @xmath100  yr .",
    "these distributions are reasonably described by single power laws , @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "we found @xmath101 and @xmath102 , for the inner field , and @xmath3 and @xmath103 for the outer field .",
    "the relative difference between the star formation histories in the two fields are uncertain , but result in a range @xmath104 , i.e. , if the @xmath55 values between the two fields differ , it is at the 23@xmath105 level .",
    "we concluded that the shapes of the mass and age distributions of the clusters in the two fields are similar , to first order , as predicted by the `` quasi - universal '' model , although it is possible that other dependencies may play a weak role .",
    "the shapes of the cluster age distributions were roughly independent of mass , and the shapes of the cluster mass functions were approximately independent of age , at least over the studied @xmath50 range .",
    "in addition , none of the distributions showed any obvious curvature at lower masses or older ages .",
    "our results are consistent with the clusters being disrupted , starting soon after they form , at a rate that is approximately independent of their mass .",
    "our results do not show evidence of mass - dependent disruption , where lower mass clusters are disrupted earlier than their higher mass counterparts . in a future study",
