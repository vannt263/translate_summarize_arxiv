    "the f nondoped compound lafeaso exhibits the structural transition from tetragonal ( p4/nmm ) to orthorhombic ( cmma ) phase at a transition temperature @xmath13155k and stripe - type antiferromagnetic order at @xmath14 with a magnetic moment @xmath15@xcite at low temperature . with increasing f doping , the system becomes metallic and the antiferromagnetic order disappears@xcite , and then , the superconductivity emerges for @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "rare - earth substitution compounds exhibit superconducting transition with higher @xmath12@xcite .",
    "specific features of the systems are two - dimensionality of the conducting fe@xmath18as@xmath18 plane and the orbital degrees of freedom in fe@xmath19 ( 3@xmath20)@xcite . the pairing symmetry together with the mechanism of the superconductivity is one of the most significant issues .",
    "the nmr knight shift measurements revealed that the superconductivity of the systems is the spin - singlet pairing@xcite .",
    "fully gapped superconducting states have been predicted by various experiments such as the penetration depth@xcite , the specific heat@xcite , the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite and the impurity effect on @xmath12@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above mentioned experiments , the nmr relaxation rate shows the power low behavior @xmath21 below @xmath22@xcite , suggesting the nodal or highly anisotropic gap structure .",
    "the other nmr measurements@xcite , however , revealed @xmath23 below @xmath12 and there is still controversy .",
    "theoretically , the first principle calculations have predicted that the nondoped system is metallic with two or three concentric hole fermi surfaces around the @xmath24 point ( @xmath25 ) and two elliptical electron fermi surfaces around the @xmath26 point ( @xmath27)@xcite . mazin _ et al . _",
    "suggested that the spin - singlet extended @xmath4-wave pairing whose order parameter changes its sign between the hole pockets and the electron pockets ( @xmath5-wave ) is favored due to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations@xcite .",
    "according to the weak coupling approaches based on multi - orbital hubbard models@xcite , the @xmath5-wave pairing or the @xmath28-wave pairing is expected to emerge .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath5-wave pairing is realized also in the strong coupling region by the mean field study based on the @xmath29-@xmath30-@xmath31 model@xcite and the exact diagonalization study based on the one - dimensional two - band hubbard model@xcite .",

    "_ , the energy bands obtained by reproduce those obtained by the density functional calculation very well@xcite . in this model , however , the spatial extensions of the fe @xmath32 like wannier orbitals are different from each other@xcite and the resulting intra - orbital terms of the on - site coulomb interaction are strongly orbital dependent@xcite .",
    "in addition , since the model explicitly includes the transfer integrals up to the fifth nearest neighbor sites@xcite , one should take the off - site coulomb interaction , which is considered to be about @xmath33 between the nearest neighbor sites , into account to ensure the consistency of the model@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the effective model which includes both the fe @xmath32 orbitals and the as @xmath34 orbitals , so called @xmath0-@xmath1 model , the spatial extensions and the differences of those between the orbitals will be considerably reduced@xcite . due to these facts , in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , it is expected that the intra - orbital terms of the on - site coulomb interaction for each orbitals have almost the same values and the off - site coulomb interaction are negligible .",

    "the on - site gap function is negative as the negative contribution of the gap function in @xmath127 space is much larger than the positive one as shown in fig .",

    "then , the gap equation can be satisfied with the large value of the on - site gap function against the repulsive on - site effective interaction .",
    "when the doping @xmath73 increases , the fermi level rises apart from the @xmath47 hole band , and then the effect of the hole band decreases resulting in the decrease in the on - site gap function as well as the decrease in the superconducting transition temperature ( not shown ) .",
    "such doping dependence of the on - site gap function has recently been observed in the 5-band hubbard model@xcite . on the contrary , in the @xmath7-wave state , the on - site pairing is always dominant almost independent of the doping @xmath73 .",

    "the @xmath5-wave pairing is realized near the isdw due to the spin fluctuations , while , the @xmath7-wave pairing is realized near the ferro - orbital ordered phase due to the charge - orbital fluctuations , where we regard the superconducting states as the @xmath7-wave states if @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath47 diagonal components of the gap function have no sign change in @xmath41 space and as the @xmath5-wave states if not .",
    "the way to determine whether the superconducting state is the @xmath5-wave state or the @xmath7-wave state is not unique .",
    "this is because the @xmath5-wave and the @xmath7-wave state are same symmetry ( a@xmath144 ) and the change between @xmath7-wave and the @xmath5-wave state is crossover .",
    "in fact , as @xmath2 increases , the on - site paring decreases , while , the off - site pairing increases continuously . at @xmath145 , the nodes appear around the @xmath26-point for the @xmath47 diagonal component and those approaches the @xmath24-point as @xmath2 increases . it is noted that we also obtain the phase diagram on @xmath3-@xmath2 plane for @xmath146 and find that the phase diagram is essentially the same as that for @xmath122 except that the magnetic and the @xmath5-wave superconducting instabilities are slightly enhanced by the larger value of the hund s coupling @xmath36 .      in this subsection",

    "it is found that the inter - orbital direct term @xmath3 which enhances the orbital fluctuations is harder to be reduced by the electron - phonon coupling than the intra - orbital direct term @xmath2 . as a result ,",
    "the orbital fluctuations are relatively enhanced by the electron - phonon coupling as compared to the spin fluctuations .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the pairing symmetry of the two - dimensional 16-band @xmath0-@xmath1 model by using the rpa and have obtained the phase diagram including the magnetic and orbital orders and the superconductivity . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the @xmath5-wave superconductivity is realized near the isdw with @xmath160 phase . on the other hand , for @xmath6",
    ", the @xmath7-wave superconductivity appears near the ferro - orbital ordered phase .",
    "the @xmath5-wave pairing is mediated by the spin fluctuations , while that the @xmath7-wave pairing is mediated by the orbital fluctuations .    for @xmath8 ,",
    "the gap function for the @xmath5-wave pairing changes its sign between the hole pockets and the electron pockets and the most dominant contribution of the gap function is the @xmath47 orbital diagonal component .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the results based on the 5-band hubbard model@xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath47 diagonal component of the gap function in our 16-band @xmath0-@xmath1 model have much larger value than the other matrix elements in comparison with the results based on the 5-band hubbard model@xcite .",
    "this may be because the outer hole fermi surface which has mainly @xmath48 and @xmath49 orbital character obtained by the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is almost circular , but that obtained by the 5-band hubbard model is diamond shape@xcite .",
    "therefore , the nesting effect which enhances the spin fluctuations becomes weak in our @xmath0-@xmath1 model , and the resulting components of @xmath120 related to @xmath48 , @xmath49 orbitals have smaller values .    for @xmath6 , the gap function in the orbital representation for the @xmath7-wave pairing dose not change its sign in @xmath41 space .",
    "in other words , the on - site pairing is much larger than the off - site pairing in the real space .",
    "this is similar to the conventional phonon - mediated superconductivity .",
    "however , the gap functions have different signs between orbitals in contrast to the conventional phonon - mediated superconductivity .",
    "we have shown that this sign change of the gap functions between orbitals is due to the effect of the pair transfer interaction @xmath37@xcite .",
    "it is noted that the @xmath7-wave state has been observed also in the one - dimensional 2-band hubbard model in the same parameter region with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it seems that the both @xmath5-wave and the @xmath7-wave states with full superconducting gaps are consistent with various experiments such as , the nmr relaxation rate , the knight shift , the arpes , the magnetic penetration depth measurements , although the sign of the gap function has not been directly observed there .",
    "however , according to the recent theoretical studies of the nonmagnetic impurity effects@xcite , anderson s theorem is violated for the @xmath5-wave superconductivity in contrast to the experimental results of very weak @xmath12-suppression in fe site substitution@xcite and neutron irradiation@xcite .",
    "since it can be considered that the impurity potential by the fe - site substitution is diagonal and local in the orbital basis according to the first principle calculation@xcite , it is expected that the @xmath7-wave state observed in the present study is more robust against the nonmagnetic impurity effects than the @xmath5-wave state .",
    "in addition to the coulomb interaction , we have also discussed the effects of the coupling @xmath161 between the electron and the @xmath148 phonon within the rpa .",
    "it has been found that the @xmath7-wave pairing realized in the unrealistic parameter region with @xmath6 for @xmath162 is enhanced due to the effect of @xmath161 and can be expanded over the realistic parameter region with @xmath8 for a realistic value of @xmath161 . in the first principle calculations for iron - based superconductors in conjunction with the migdal - eliashberg theory ,",
    "the electron - phonon coupling is found to be too small to obtain high @xmath12 observed in experiments@xcite .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction , however , has not been discussed there . in the present study ,",
    "the cooperative effect of the coulomb interaction and the electron - phonon coupling is crucial for the enhancement of the orbital fluctuations which induce the @xmath7-wave superconductivity .",
    "recently , the large isotope effects on the transition temperatures for both the sdw and the superconductivity have been observed@xcite .",
    "this experimental result implies that not only the coulomb interaction but also the electron - phonon coupling plays crucial effects on the electronic states for iron - based superconductors .    in early theoretical studies for the copper oxide superconductors , the effect of the coulomb interaction between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons",
    "@xmath163 was studied by several authors@xcite . according to the rpa study based on the @xmath0-@xmath1 model with the single @xmath47 orbital ,",
    "@xmath163 enhances the charge fluctuations with @xmath164 and the @xmath4-wave superconductivity is realized due to the effect of charge fluctuations@xcite .",
    "in addition , the @xmath165-expansion approaches ( @xmath166 is the spin - orbital degeneracy ) revealed that the strong correlation effect enhances the charge fluctuations together with the @xmath4-wave superconductivity@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that , in the present @xmath0-@xmath1 model with multi @xmath0 orbitals , @xmath163 enhances the charge - orbital fluctuations which induce the @xmath7-wave superconductivity .",
    "the explicit calculations based on the @xmath0-@xmath1 model including not only the on - site coulomb interaction but also the inter - site coulomb interaction @xmath163 together with the electron - phonon coupling @xmath161 are now under way .",
