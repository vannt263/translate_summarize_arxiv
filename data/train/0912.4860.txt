    "charm physics is an active field full with chances and challenges @xcite .",
    "decays of charmonia may provide an ideal laboratory to study perturbative as well as non - perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . until now",
    ", most of hadronic decays of p - wave charmonium states @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are not well understood compared to the @xmath11 decays , so that they cause great interests of the experimentalists and theorists to further explore the decay behavior of @xmath9 .    in the hadron 2009 conference ,",
    "the bes - iii collaboration announced its observations of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) decaying into light vector mesons , where the data of @xmath9 are taken from @xmath12 million radiative - decay events of @xmath13 collected at the bes - iii . among those decay modes of @xmath9 decaying into light vector mesons , @xmath14 processes were measured for the first time and the doubly ozi suppressed process @xmath15 had not been measured before the bes - iii observation @xcite .    generally , the decays of @xmath16 into two light vector mesons are suppressed compared to the corresponding decays of @xmath17 and @xmath18 due to the helicity selection rule @xcite .",
    "besides , @xmath19 suffers from the double - ozi suppression @xcite .",
    "thus , in the sense , the branching ratios of the channels @xmath20 should be small and it would be difficult to observe them in experiments , especially @xmath21 . however , the observation of @xmath22 seems to be surprising and compel us to reconsider what mechanism plays the dominant role in those decays",
    ". it would be definitely different from that responsible for @xmath23 decays . to understand the governing mechanism which results in sizable ratios for @xmath23 ,",
    "two questions must be answered : ( 1 ) what is the source to alleviate the helicity selection rule for @xmath16 ; ( 2 ) why the double - ozi suppression is violated for @xmath21 decay .",
    "the conventional decay mechanism depicting @xmath9 into two light vector mesons is that @xmath24 and @xmath25 annihilate into a pair of gluons , which then transit into quark - antiquark pairs to form the light vector mesons in the final state .",
    "the helicity selection rule manifests in the @xmath9 decays , and results in the suppression of @xmath16 decaying into two light mesons . in @xmath16",
    "decays , the non - perturbative qcd effect plays a crucial role . as an important non - perturbative effect , the hadronic loop contributions , which were introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and applied to study charmonium decay @xcite and open - charm and hidden charm decays of charmonium - like states @xmath26 @xcite extensively , would change the whole scenario from the conventional decay mechanism of charmonium .    for @xmath16 into two light vector mesons , a quark level description of the hadronic loop contribution",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ bw ] . here , red fermion line denotes charm quark , blue and green lines represent the light quarks . @xmath16",
    "first dissolves into two virtual charmed mesons , then by exchanging an appropriate hadron ( i.e. it possesses appropriate charge , flavor , spin and isospin ) they turn into two on - shell real light hadrons , which can be caught by detector @xcite .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath16 into two light vector mesons via hadronic loop effect can be described as @xmath27 the depiction at the hadron level corresponding to the quark level diagrams are presented in fig .",
    "[ bw ] . here , the suitable intermediated charmed mesons for the decay of @xmath16 into two light vector mesons should be @xmath28 , which interact with @xmath16 via s - wave .",
    "the exchanged mesons include pseudoscalar and vector charmed mesons .",
    "thus , by the hadronic loop mechanism , the transition of @xmath16 into two light vector mesons would not be suppressed by the helicity selection rule .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we need to emphasize that the ratios of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are not sensitive to the parameter @xmath32 corresponding to the @xmath2 mixing .",
    "furthermore , these two ratios should be independent of the coupling constants , thus the measurement on their values may provide an ideal opportunity to test the @xmath2 mixing .",
    "to summarize , in this work , we study the mesonic loop contributions and the @xmath2 mixing effect to the branching ratios of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . from the results",
    ", one can note that the @xmath2 mixing plays an important role in the understanding of the clear signal for @xmath36 observed in experiments .",
    "our results also indicate that accurate measurements on the ratios @xmath37 and @xmath38 are very helpful for checking mesonic loop contributions and the @xmath2 mixing effect .",
    "it is noted from the figures we presented in the text that the uncertainties in the theoretical computations originate from the errors of the data , therefore more accurate measurements are necessary for further studies .",
    "fortunately , a large database on such rare decay modes will be available at bes - iii , which will help to draw more solid conclusions .",
    "_ notes added _ : very recently , a similar work @xcite appeared in the arxiv submitted by x.h .",
    "liu and q. zhao when this manuscript was close to completion . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors calculated @xmath39 and @xmath40 processes by taking hadronic loop effect into account .",
    "then , the branching ratios of @xmath41 are obtained . in our work",
    ", we mainly focused on @xmath42 channels , where we also consider the hadronic loop effect .",
    "our discussion is based on the recent preliminary results of @xmath43 presented by the bes collaboration at the hadron 2009 conference , especially the first observation of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "furthermore we proposed that the @xmath2 mixing can be tested via @xmath8 decays , which is different from the idea in ref .",
