    "the njl model @xcite consists of massless quarks plus a four fermion interaction term @xmath4 the theory generates the famous gap equation @xmath5 \\right ) \\,,\\ ] ] which has non - zero solutions for @xmath3 when @xmath6 .",
    "we can understand the origin of this gap equation in two ways .",
    "firstly directly from the diagrammatic schwinger dyson equation shown in fig [ njl1](a ) and secondly by minimizing the effective potential resulting from the diagrams in fig [ njl1](b ) plus the classical four fermion operator . note that this represents a mean field approximation , justifiable at large @xmath7 .",
    "the effective potential @xcite from the massive quark loops is given by @xmath8 without the njl term the quark mass is a parameter of the theory and one should not minimize this potential with respect to @xmath3 . in the presence of the njl interaction",
    "we add @xmath9 where we have used the classical result in the presence of a quark condensate @xmath10 .",
    "now since @xmath11 might induce @xmath3 we do seek to minimize the potential against @xmath3 .",
    "we plot the form of the potential in fig [ njl2 ] for various values of @xmath11 . for infinite",
    "@xmath11 the loop term dominates and the potential is unbounded preferring @xmath12 .",
    "as @xmath11 decreases from infinity the four fermion term enters making the potential bounded at large @xmath3 . for a regime of @xmath11 down to the critical coupling",
    "there is a non - zero @xmath3 at the potential minimum . below the critical @xmath11 @xmath13",
    "is the minimum .",
    "there is therefore a second order transition to chiral symmetry breaking at @xmath14 .",
    "the simplest realization of quarks in holography is provided by placing probe d7 branes in the ads@xmath15 geometry representing the inclusion of quenched @xmath0 quark multiplets in @xmath2 super yang mills @xcite .",
    "we write the metric as @xmath16 where @xmath17 with @xmath18 the ads radius .",
    "the probe , which fills the @xmath19 directions at constant @xmath20 has action @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the d7 brane tension times the volume factor of the space @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in ads the dilaton , @xmath25 , is a constant .",
    "varying the action gives @xmath26 since the action only depends on @xmath27 there is a conserved quantity @xmath28 from which we learn @xmath29 and hence at large @xmath30 @xmath31 the only regular solutions over all @xmath30 have @xmath32 as can be seen from ( [ conserved ] ) and hence are the constant embeddings @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath3 is interpreted as proportional to the hypermultiplet mass .",
    "since @xmath3 is a parameter of the theory we insist on it being fixed in the uv i.e. we pick the uv boundary condition @xmath34 for the euler lagrange problem . in the ir we pick @xmath35 which is satisfied since @xmath36 for the @xmath33 solution .",
    "witten s prescription @xcite to include double trace operators is to set a new appropriate uv boundary condition . here",
    "we wish to include a term like that in ( [ ffo ] ) which at a classical level implies the quark mass is given by @xmath37 so , if we treat the parameter @xmath38 as the condensate then we want at the uv boundary @xmath39 we can achieve this by adding a uv boundary action term @xmath40 now at the uv boundary we no longer require after variation of @xmath41 @xmath34 but allow @xmath41 to change and instead impose @xmath42 which gives the required @xmath43 relation at leading order for large @xmath44 .",
    "we maintain the ir boundary condition @xmath36 .",
    "in the base supersymmetric theory we have already found the solutions of the euler lagrange equations that satisfy this ir condition - they are just @xmath33 .",
    "these though only satisfy the new uv boundary term when @xmath13 since @xmath38 is always zero .",
    "the four fermion interaction does not therefore behave in a standard njl model fashion here - it does not generate a mass no matter how large the coupling .",
    "this may seem surprising but is best understood by considering the effective potential .",
    "first note that the boundary term we have added to the action is up to a multiplicative constant , basically the classical effective potential term that is added in the njl model ( [ vterm ] ) since in the uv @xmath33 and at large @xmath44 : @xmath45 . if we begin at @xmath46 then the extra uv boundary term vanishes and the effective potential for @xmath3 is just the original action of the d7 probe evaluated on the solutions @xmath33 .",
    "all these solutions have the same potential since the action ( [ action ] ) only depends on @xmath27 .",
    "this analysis mimics that of the njl model but here there is a sharp contrast to the njl model where an unbounded potential with @xmath3 is found in this limit . in the supersymmetric case",
    "presumably cancellations in vacuum loops between the quarks and squarks remove any @xmath3 dependence . at finite",
    "@xmath11 the bulk action continues not to discriminate between different @xmath3 solutions but the uv term simply chooses the lowest value of @xmath3 which is zero .",
    "it is clear though how we should progress to reconjure njl - like dynamics ; if we can raise the action of solutions with small @xmath3 relative to those with large @xmath3 in the base theory the expected njl dynamics will reappear . in fact this is easy to do by including any ir relevant supersymmetry breaking perturbation .",
    "such an interaction will generate some non - zero @xmath27 in ( [ action ] ) raising the action for embeddings associated with small quark masses , sensitive to the ir , but large mass solutions will asymptote to the supersymmetric theory s lowest possible action . as a first example we will consider the case where the perturbation is a @xmath47 baryon number magnetic field .",
    "a @xmath47 baryon number magnetic field , @xmath48 , can be introduced into the d3/probe d7 model through the world volume vector of the d7 brane @xcite .",
    "@xmath48 enters in the action as an effective dilaton term @xmath49 the magnetic field by itself induces chiral symmetry breaking . since we are interested primarily in the chiral symmetry breaking properties of the njl interaction term it is convenient initially to turn off the deep ir effects of @xmath48",
    "this is easily done by setting an ir cut off on the model @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath48 field then enters into the bulk action to discriminate between different @xmath3 solutions but does not have sufficient ir power to drive chiral symmetry breaking itself ( we will also study the @xmath51 case shortly ) .    without the njl operator one would solve the euler lagrange equations subject in the ir to @xmath52 .",
    "the solutions run to different uv values of @xmath53 and each gives the appropriate solution for that value of @xmath3 . in fig [ fig:3 ] ( top )",
    "we plot examples of such solutions ( with @xmath54 ) .",
    "now we can introduce the njl operator by changing the uv boundary condition . for each choice of @xmath11 we could search amongst the solutions of fig [ fig:3 ] ( top ) for those that satisfy the new uv boundary condition ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "alternatively we can compute their action as an effective potential from ( [ action ] ) and ( [ bound ] ) ( note that ( [ bound ] ) still holds since @xmath55 in the uv ) - the solution we seek will be the minimum .",
    "in fact the action is uv divergent generating a term @xmath56 . since we will have an explicit uv cut off we could just leave this large piece in the results but we choose to show plots where we subtract a term @xmath56 from all values we quote .",
    "we compute both the integral over the lagrangian evaluated on the solution in the bulk plus the boundary term ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "the results for some different @xmath11 and for @xmath57 are shown in the middle plot of fig [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the model displays all the characteristics of the njl model .",
    "the effective potential from the integration of the action over the bulk falls with larger mass in the absence of the njl interaction .    when the njl interaction surface term is included the potential turns up and becomes bounded .",
    "there is a second order phase transition with the njl interaction at a critical value as we show in the bottom graph of fig [ fig:3 ] which shows the growth of the mass against @xmath11 .",
    "next we can study the theory with the magnetic field in the limit where the ir cut off is taken to zero .",
    "now the b field itself introduces chiral symmetry breaking and the njl interaction will act to enhance it .",
    "the top figure of fig [ fig:4 ] shows the chiral symmetry breaking induced by the b field on its own - here we plot regular embeddings without the njl interaction i.e. those with @xmath58 for the case @xmath59 .",
    "the embedding for @xmath13 in the uv displays curvature now and bends away from the origin - there is a non - zero condensate @xmath38 asymptotically and the ir clearly breaks the u(1)@xmath60 symmetry .    in the central figure of fig [ fig:4 ]",
    "we show the effective potential against @xmath3 with a uv cut off of 100 in units of @xmath61 .",
    "when the njl term is absent the potential is again unbounded but for finite njl coupling the effective potential is minimized for a non - zero value of @xmath3 .    here , as the lower figure in fig [ fig:4 ] shows , the njl operator generates a mass no matter how small the njl operator is ( this is because there is already a condensate present due to @xmath48 ) . as the njl operator coupling",
    "is increased the mass grows .",
    "this is consistent with gap equation analysis of chiral symmetry breaking theories enhanced by njl operators ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "another possible ir deformation is finite temperature @xcite . in appropriate coordinates for embedding a d7 brane",
    "the ads - schwarzschild metric with the horizon at @xmath62 is @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 ( note @xmath65 in the uv and @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 the dbi action for the d7 is with an effective dilaton term @xmath68 note here we have also included a magnetic field .",
    "the ir boundary condition remains as @xmath58 except the embedding can also potentially end on the black hole horizon .",
    "when @xmath69 the embeddings for all @xmath3 are minkowski and take the qualitative form of those in fig [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the behaviour with an njl interaction therefore follows the same generic behaviour of the previous section . when @xmath70there is a phase transition @xcite to a chirally symmetric phase where the embeddings for light quark masses lie on the horizon . here",
    "we will concentrate on this high temperature phase , setting @xmath71 and varying @xmath48 .",
    "firstly we can set @xmath72 .",
    "we can plot the effective potential derived from the embeddings action ( [ action ] ) against the quark mass ( of course without an njl term one should not minimize this potential - the mass is a fixed uv parameter but the form of the potential will show the behaviour with an njl term present ) . in the lower graph of fig [ fig:5 ]",
    "we show this potential as the lowest curve .",
    "the minimum lies at @xmath13 and the potential grows with @xmath3 .",
    "the reason here that the action can be lower for embeddings that probe the deep ir is that the horizon truncates the space reducing the d7 world volume over which the action is computed .",
    "note there is a discontinuity at @xmath73 where the embeddings move off the black hole .",
    "this marks the famous meson - melting phase transition @xcite where the embedding switches at a first order transition from a black hole embedding to a minkowski embedding .",
    "were we to introduce an additional njl term into the theory then , as we have seen , we would add an effective potential piece @xmath74 which would further lift the potential at non - zero @xmath3 .",
    "the minimum of the potential for all values of the njl coupling remains zero .",
    "given the base @xmath0 quark theory does not generate chiral condensation with an njl term it is no surprise that adding temperature does not change this situation .",
    "we can uncover some more interesting behaviour as we turn up a magnetic field . in the lower plot of fig [ fig:5 ]",
    "we show the effective potential in the theory without an njl term for various values of @xmath48 .",
    "the effect of @xmath48 is to raise the level of the potential but more so in the ir than the uv .",
    "when @xmath75 the uv potential falls in value below the @xmath13 value . above this value of @xmath48",
    "an njl operator can generate a chiral symmetry breaking vacuum .",
    "we show this in detail for one case @xmath76 and @xmath57 in fig [ fig:6 ] . for large values of the njl coupling chiral symmetry breaking",
    "is observed but there is a first order phase transition to a chirally symmetric theory at @xmath77 . even at large @xmath11",
    "the @xmath13 configuration is a metastable vacua .",
    "the first order transition is also a meson melting transition .",
    "it is important to stress that all of the theories we have studied have no bare mass term .",
    "the mass is always dynamically generated by the njl interaction .",
    "this means that all these configurations are associated with a goldstone boson .",
    "if one considers the embeddings of fig [ fig:3],[fig:4 ] or [ fig:5 ] but now without an njl term then each embedding corresponds to a different uv hard mass - naively there is a flat direction in the potential associated with rotating the embedding in the @xmath20 direction of the metric .",
    "however , such a state is not a physical state in the theory because the asymptotic fall off of the perturbation from the vaccum goes as @xmath78 not as @xmath79 .",
    "when though the configurations are viewed in the light of the njl theory then @xmath80 and rotating the embedding in @xmath20 is then just changing the phase of the condensate @xmath38 - they are now physical states .",
    "one can therefore see the flat direction in the potential ( rotations in @xmath20 ) that generate the goldstone mode fluctuations .",
    "we have introduced njl operators into the d3/probe d7 system using the double trace prescription of witten . in the basic system",
    "there are no embeddings of the d7 that satisfy both the ir and the new uv boundary conditions other than @xmath81 , the flat embedding with no mass or condensate . to understand this we showed that the effective potential of the model without the presence of an njl interaction is flat with the quark mass as a result of the @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "this is distinct from the usual njl model where the potential is unbounded to large @xmath3 .",
    "we have argued that ir deformations of the d3/d7 system will lift the effective potential at small mass and so restore njl like behaviour with dynamical mass generation above a critical njl coupling .",
    "the precise critical coupling depends on the ir deformation .",
    "we have exhibited several examples . with a magnetic field present but an ir cut off , so it does not itself generate chiral symmetry breaking , we saw a second order transition at the njl chiral transition .",
    "this model is very reminiscent of the original njl model . in the case where the magnetic field is present with",
    "no ir cut off the b field itself triggers chiral symmetry breaking and we have seen that the njl interaction then enhances the condensate smoothly as it is switched on and strengthened .",
    "finite temperature usually disfavours chiral symmetry breaking and it indeed generates an effective potential that does not allow the njl operator to generate condensation .",
    "we found an interesting example with both @xmath82 and @xmath48 present though . for small njl interaction the temperature",
    "forbids the condensation but at larger values there is a first order transition to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we believe these cases provide examples of all possible generic behaviours with njl interactions .",
    "the overall picture is very satisfying and provides a new controlled example of chiral symmetry breaking/ quark condensate formation in a top down holographic model .",
    "the methodology may also be of interest for looking at extended technicolour @xcite type interactions in holographic models of technicolour dynamics such as @xcite .",
