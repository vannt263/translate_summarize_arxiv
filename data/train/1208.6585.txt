    "the high - temperature limit of the one - loop thermal green s functions enjoys some important properties which allow us to obtain a closed - form expression for the corresponding effective actions of abelian as well as non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "one such property is the existence of simple ward identities , which relate the @xmath1-point with the ( @xmath2)-point functions , reflecting the underlying gauge invariance of the effective action . also , these high - temperature green s functions have a characteristic analytic dependence on the external momenta , yielding effective actions which are nonlocal functionals of the external fields @xcite . in the high - temperature limit , it is also possible to sum an infinite set of higher loop contributions to the free energy , the so - called ring diagrams , which are individually infrared divergent @xcite .",
    "similar properties are also encountered in quantum gravity , where the ward identities emerge as a consequence of the invariance under general coordinate transformations @xcite . however , in the case of gravity , it has not been possible to find an explicit closed - form expression for the underlying , nonlocal , effective action as a functional of the metric field .",
    "for the special case when the metric fields are static , we have shown recently that it is possible to sum all the 1pi one - loop @xmath1-graviton functions in terms of a local closed - form expression for the effective action in the high - temperature limit @xcite . a key ingredient in order to obtain this result was the use of the identity between the high - temperature static and the zero four - momentum limit of all the one - loop thermal green s functions . throughout this work , the equivalence between the _",
    "static _ hard thermal loop and the _ zero - momentum _ thermal amplitudes will be abbreviated as _",
    "szm identity_. this property has been shown to be true by explicitly computing the two- and three - point functions at one - loop order @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the limit where all the spacial components of the external momenta vanish ( long - wavelength limit ) , the thermal green s functions are not the same as in the static limit for high - temperatures @xcite .",
    "for example the high - temperature limit of the self - energy has different static- and long wavelength limits @xcite .",
    "this occurs because in the long - wavelength limit the analytic continuation from discrete to continuous external energies would modify the integrands of the thermal green s functions in a nontrivial way .",
    "( throughout this work , we will employ the imaginary time formalism @xcite . ) another way to understand why the long - wavelength and the high - temperature limits do not commute is to notice that the leading high - temperature contribution arises from the region where the loop three - momentum is much larger than any external three - momentum @xcite",
    ".    the static limit of the hard thermal loop contributions to thermal amplitudes can be quite cumbersome in general , specially when the amplitudes have more than two external legs .",
    "this is because one usually would have to keep the external three - momenta nonzero before the integration over the loop momenta is performed ; only in the end of the calculation would the external three - momenta be reduced to zero .",
    "this is even more difficult when considering two or more loops .",
    "the szm identity shows that the final result can be obtained in a much simpler and direct way .    from the one - loop effective action derived in reference @xcite one",
    "can easily obtain the pressure of noninteracting thermal particles subjected to an external static gravitational field . in a more realistic physical scenario",
    ", one would have to take into account the self - interactions of the thermal particles . in principle",
    "this can be investigated by computing the higher - loop contributions , which necessarily involves interactions between the thermal particles . in order to tackle this issue in a systematic fashion",
    ", we will investigate in the present work the possibility that the szm identity holds also at the two - loop order for the 1pi diagrams .",
    "this issue is also of interest from a broader point of view , since there are few higher - loop results at finite temperature , and our analysis is completely general to the extent that it includes theories with cubic and quartic vertices as well as more general cases , like the weak field expansion of gravity .",
    "it is important to point out that the szm identity can not be true when there are external fermionic lines .",
    "this is so because it is not possible to make the energy of an external fermionic line equal to zero before performing the matsubara sum and the subsequent analytic continuation of the external energy . as a simple explicit example",
    ", one may consider the static electron self - energy which behaves like @xmath3 for high - temperatures @xcite .",
    "therefore , throughout this work , the external lines of the amplitudes are always bosonic .",
    "this important limitation shows that the szm identity is an intrinsic property of the thermal field theories , since there would be no such distinction between fermionic and bosonic external energies at zero temperature .    in the next section",
    "we will review the one - loop calculations which lead to the szm identity described above .",
    "we perform an iterative analysis which shows that the one - loop szm identity can be systematically verified for all the @xmath1-point functions , generalizing the results found in ref . @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the two - loop contributions for the two - point function and explicitly verify the szm identity for two nontrivial diagrammatic topologies .",
    "( there are another three topologies which are dealt with similarly in the appendix . ) as an example of a trivial topology , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a one - loop diagram which does not depend on the external momentum , and therefore satisfies trivially the szm identity .",
    "( in quantum gravity one should also consider the one - point function which is obviously also independent of the external momentum , at any order in the loop expansion . ) similarly , the two - loop diagrams in fig . [ fig2 ] are also independent of the external momentum .",
    "the topologies shown in fig . [ fig3 ] can also be considered trivial in the sense that the proof of the szm identity is similar to the one - loop case . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we discuss our results and possible developments .",
    "in a theory of scalar fields , all the diagrammatic topologies depicted in the present work would represent the full contribution to a given amplitude . when considering a spinor , vector or tensor theory ( like gravity ) , there may be several components associated with a given topology . as will be clear in what follows , for the purpose of our present analysis , it is not necessary to make explicit which component we are taking into account .",
    "all components can be encompassed in the same framework , so that whenever we refer to a given amplitude , we are in fact considering several components .    in this subsection",
    "we will consider , as a simple example , the one - loop self - energy .",
    "this will illustrate our basic idea and also allow us to introduce the main notation .",
    "there are two basic topologies which contribute to the self - energy at the one - loop order .",
    "the first topology , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is independent of the external momentum , and the szm identity is trivial .",
    "the only nontrivial topology which contributes to the one - loop self - energy is shown in fig .  [ fig:1loop_top1 ] .        in the static limit ( @xmath4 ) , this amplitude can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "( in this work we will omit the integration over the spacial components of the loop momenta since it is not important for the validity of our arguments ; we remark that this makes our results valid in @xmath0 space - time dimensions . ) here we are using the usual expression for the matsubara sum in terms of an integral over the contours @xmath8 and @xmath9 shown in fig .",

    "( in the contour @xmath9 it is convenient to make @xmath14 , which is valid for the temperature - dependent contribution . )",
    "the function @xmath15 is model dependent , and it represents some tensor or spinor component . in general , the function @xmath16 depends on the external four - momentum @xmath17 .",
    "however , for the yang - mills theory or gravity , the components of @xmath16 are polynomials , and so , in the high - temperature limit , we can make @xmath18 in @xmath16 @xcite . for our present purposes ,",
