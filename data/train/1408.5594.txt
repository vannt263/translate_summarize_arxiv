    "jupiter s size is 1,300 times that of the earth . its mass is more than twice the mass of all planets in our solar system combined .",
    "jupiter s fast rotation  one in 10 hours  creates strong jet streams that smear its clouds into bands of zones and belts of almost constant latitude",
    ". another frequently discussed feature of jupiter is its great red spot ( grs ) , the largest and longest - living known atmospheric vortex .",
    "the grs is a nearly two - dimensional feature that is apparently unrelated to the topography of the planet @xcite .",
    "such vortices abound in nature , but grs s size , long - term persistence , and temporal longitudinal oscillations make it unique .",
    "jupiter s atmospheric features are generally inferred from still images , but should clearly be time - dependent objects in the planet s turbulent atmosphere . in fluid dynamics , evolving features in a complex flow are often referred to as transport barriers , which in turn are described as objects that can not be crossed by other fluid trajectories . however intuitive",
    "this characterization of barriers might sound , it actually labels all points in a moving continuum as part of a barrier .",
    "this is because any material surface ( i .. e , a connected , time - evolving set of fluid trajectories ) is impenetrable to other trajectories in a flow with unique trajectories .",
    "indeed , a transport barrier is more than just an impenetrable material object : it is a material surface that remains coherent by withstanding stretching and filamentation @xcite .    a recent approach in dynamical systems theory seeks transport barriers in unsteady flows as key material surfaces with exceptionally coherent features in their deformation .",
    "these exceptional material surfaces , lagrangian coherent structures ( or lcss ) , were initially defined as most attracting , repelling or shearing material surfaces @xcite . turning this definition into computable mathematical results",
    "has proven challenging , prompting instead a widespread use of intuitive diagnostics in lcs detection ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "alternative approaches have also been developed in the meantime to target regions enclosed by lcss ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more recent advances have re - addressed the unsolved mathematical challenges by seeking an lcs as a stationary curve of the lagrangian strain or shear functional computed along material lines @xcite .",
    "these variational methods ( here collectively referred to as geodesic lcs theory ) uncover lcss as null - geodesics of appropriate strain tensor fields computed from the deformation field .",
    "in contrast to the visual assessment of features in intuitive diagnostic fields , geodesic lcs theory renders transport barriers as smooth , parametrized curves that are exact solutions of well - defined stationarity principles .",
    "these solutions depend only on frame - invariant tensor fields , and hence remain the same in translating and rotating frames . given these advantages ,",
    "we use geodesic lcs detection in the present work to uncover unsteady transport barriers in jupiter s atmosphere .",
    "locating geodesic lcss requires a time - resolved velocity field . for jupiter",
    ", a representative two - dimensional wind - velocity field can be obtained via image - correlation analysis of available cloud videos . in this work ,",
    "we apply the advection corrected correlation image velocimetry ( acciv ) method @xcite to obtain a high - density , time - resolved representation of jupiter s wind field from an enhanced version of a video taken by the cassini mission of nasa in 2000 .",
    "our main objective in this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we would like to provide a technical review of geodesic lcs theory , summarizing various aspects of the theory from different sources in a unified notation .",
    "second , we wish to show how this theory reveals details of objectively ( i.e. , frame - invariantly ) defined coherent structures in an unsteady flow known only from remote optical sensing .",
    "this flow , the wind field of jupiter reconstructed from the cassini video , embodies all the major challenges to practical transport barrier detection .",
    "first , the data covers a relatively short time period ; second , it is temporally aperiodic ; and third , it was captured in a non - inertial frame of reference .",
    "these complications necessitate the correct handling of finite - time ( as opposed to asymptotic ) dynamical systems structures ; an abandonment of recurrence and temporal convergence assumptions ; and the use of objective ( i.e. , frame - invariant ) methods ( cf .",

    ", our analysis uncovers elliptic and parabolic invariant manifolds in a non - autonomous , temporally aperiodic , finite - time dynamical system . until recently ,",
    "a precise definition and extraction of such manifolds has been an unsolved problem even for analytically defined velocity models .",

    "the resulting velocities were then all viewed as part of an underlying steady wind field .",
    "this steady vector field produced spiraling streamlines near the grs without a clear indication of material barriers .",
    "later work @xcite used three high - resolution snapshots from the 2000 galileo mission to construct a steady velocity field from automated cloud - tracking via image correlation velocimetry .",
    "again , trajectories spiraling into the grs emerged from this time - averaged analysis , indicating no particular closed material barrier around the grs .",

    "the approach , however , does not address the question of actual material transport via the unsteady winds of jupiter .",
    "extracting an unsteady velocity field and analyzing its finite - time transport barriers has not been attempted in prior publications .",
    "one reason for this is a clear focus of the planetary science community on long - term evolution in jupiter s climate .",
    "comparing velocity snapshots and averages taken from different missions and different years , rather than studying a video footage from a single mission , is clearly more appropriate for a study of climate evolution .",
    "the unavoidable time - dependence of velocities extracted from temporally close video frames has , in fact , been viewed as undesirable uncertainty to an envisioned steady mean velocity field ( see , e.g. , asay - davis et al .",
    "another reason for the lack of unsteady transport barrier studies for jupiter has been the unavailability of precise mathematical tools ( such as those surveyed here in section [ sec : lcs ] ) for lcs extraction from finite - time , aperiodic velocity data .      the raw footage acquired by the cassini orbiter comprises 14 cylindrical maps of jupiter , covering the 10 days ranging from october 31 to november 9 in the year 2000 .",

    "we computed an offset error as the @xmath67-distance between the pixels of the advected initial raw image and the raw image at the final time , normalized by the @xmath67-norm of the final raw image .",
    "in this fashion , we obtained an offset error of @xmath68 , which is in the order otherwise expected from numerical noise , processing errors , and diffusive cloud mixing .",
    "image - correlation analysis applied to available cloud videos provides a two - dimensional representation of jupiter s winds .",
    "early wind - field reconstruction studies required a human operator to identify the same cloud feature in subsequent frames @xcite .",
    "the seminal paper by limaye @xcite introduced the first automated image - correlation method using one - dimensional correlations along latitudinal circles .",
    "later improvements involved two - dimensional extensions and coarse - to - fine iteration schemes @xcite .",
    "recent approaches add an advection equation to the procedure @xcite , or apply the idea of an optical flow @xcite .",
    "similar methods have also been applied to image sequences of other planets such as saturn @xcite , uranus and neptune @xcite , and the earth @xcite .",
    "here we use the advection corrected correlation image velocimetry ( acciv ) algorithm developed in @xcite to extract a time - resolved atmospheric velocity field from the enhanced cassini footage described in section [ section : video_footage ] .",
    "acciv uses the idea of the two - pass image correlation velocimetry ( civ ) developed by @xcite for experimental fluid velocity measurement . in @xcite ,",
    "the acciv algorithm was employed to reconstruct steady velocity fields from image pairs provided by the hubble space telescope , as well as by the galileo and cassini space missions . to our knowledge , however , the acciv algorithm has not been employed before to reconstruct and analyze a time - resolved , unsteady velocity field from a full video footage .",
    "acciv is an iterative technique for reconstructing a velocity field that is assumed to advect an observed scalar field passively . as a first step , acciv recursively splits two successive images @xmath69 and @xmath70 into sub - images or correlation boxes",
    "then , for a correlation box @xmath71 , acciv finds a matching box @xmath72 of the same size .",
    "the process of matching correlation boxes is performed by maximizing the cross - correlation between intensity patterns .",
    "the velocity at the center of @xmath73 is then the distance between the centers of @xmath73 and @xmath74 divided by the time elapsed .",
    "the algorithm repeats this process for all the correlation boxes in the image @xmath69 , yielding a crude velocity field approximation under the assumption that a correlation box moves from image @xmath69 to the subsequent image @xmath70 without any distortion .",
    "the crude initial velocity approximation is then used to advect the images to some intermediate time when no real data are available .",
    "the difference between the synthetic images at the intermediate time is iteratively used to generate correction vector fields , producing increasingly accurate velocity vectors . in a second step",
    ", acciv makes use of the first - step results and looks for a correlation between a box of pixels in the image @xmath69 and a box of pixels transformed in the subsequent image @xmath70 .",
    "the possible transformations are a combination of translation , rotation , shear and distortion .",
    "figure [ fig : correlation_box ] illustrates how considering a deformed correlation box can lead to a better approximation of the displacement vector at the center of the correlation box @xmath73 .",
    "similar to the first step , acciv iteratively improves the accuracy of the velocity vectors by building synthetic images and producing correction vectors .",
    "the next steps consist of further refinement of the velocity field using smaller correlation boxes .",
    "+    ` acciv first pass `    ` acciv second pass `            acciv repeats each of these steps iteratively until the _ velocity correlation uncertainty _ shows no further decrease .",
    "first , acciv defines the offset between advected and raw images at time @xmath75 as local _ correlation location uncertainty_. the correlation velocity uncertainty is then the correlation location uncertainty divided by the time elapsed between the images .",
    "the velocity fields we have extracted with acciv have tens to hundreds of thousands of independent velocity vectors with uncertainties on the order of 2 - 5 @xmath76 .",
    "figure [ fig : temporal_uncertainty ] shows the measure of correlation velocity uncertainty as a percentage of the spatial mean velocity for each video frame .",
    "the near - periodicity of the uncertainty history arises from the mostly even sampling frequency ( roughly two jovian days ) of the original raw footage from cassini .",
    "two time intervals ( around days 5 - 7 and 16 - 18 ) with shorter sampling times create an impression of approximate symmetry in the uncertainty distribution with respect to day 12 , but this is accidental .",
    "on average , the extracted velocity vectors have about @xmath77 uncertainty with respect to the mean of the reconstructed velocities .",
    "figure [ fig : spatial_uncertainty ] shows the spatial distribution of velocity uncertainty as a percentage of the velocity norm at each grid point .",
    "the velocity uncertainty is higher in regions such as the grs where we have complicated dynamics and presumably cloud mixing .",
    "we recall that we integrate the reconstructed velocity field to find structurally stable structures : limit cycles for elliptic lcss and robust heteroclinic cycles for parabolic lcss ( cf .",
    "section 3 ) .",
    "these structures persist in the ( unknown ) true velocity field , as long as the imaging and reconstruction errors represent an overall moderate perturbation to the flow map , such as the perturbation we infer from fig .",
    "5 . this persistence result holds even if the velocity errors are pointwise large at times ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    some input parameters for acciv , such as the times between frames and the threshold for removing outliers , are straightforward to specify .",
    "other parameters , such as correlation box size , search range , and stride , must be optimized iteratively .",

    "this supersedes the resolution of earlier velocity fields reconstructed for jupiter from manual cloud - tracking approaches @xcite .",
    "+        in principle , an alternative to the acciv method used here would be digital particle image velocimetry ( dpiv ) , which reproduces fluid velocities from highly resolved tracks of luminescent particles in well - illuminated laboratory flows @xcite . under such conditions , high - speed imaging can reliably detect small particle displacements amidst minimal illumination changes , a basic requirement for the optical flow methods underlying dpiv . in observations of planetary atmospheres , however , these ideal imaging conditions are generally not met .",
    "for instance , the sunlight scattered from jupiter s cloud cover into the camera of a spacecraft tends to vary considerably between two subsequent images .    as a consequence ,",

    "as is now well - established for satellite altimetry maps of the ocean , even without capturing smaller ( sub - mesocale and lower ) features of a velocity field , one can accurately capture its mesoscale lcss , which in turn agree with in situ float observations @xcite .",
    "available observational records of jupiter go back to the late 19th century , indicating that jupiter s atmosphere is highly stable in the latitudinal direction .",
    "the average zonal velocity profile as a function of latitudinal degree is , therefore , an important benchmark in assessing the quality of the reconstructed velocity field .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel_comparison ] , we compare the temporally averaged zonal velocity profile obtained from acciv with the classic profile reported by limaye @xcite . the limaye profile has been used and confirmed by several other studies on different data sets from different missions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies all support the conclusion that the averaged zonal wind field constructed by limaye @xcite has remained fundamentally unaltered .",

    "we compute the lagrangian cores of jet streams located between latitudes @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( see fig . [ fig : jet_map]a ) . in line with the model - based conclusions of @xcite",
    ", we find coherent lagrangian jet cores both for eastward and westward jets .",
    "unlike the straight lines suggested by individual snapshots , however , the actual unsteady jet cores exhibit small - amplitude north - south oscillations , as shown in fig . [",

    "latitudinal degree.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]         figure [ fig : chevrons ] shows the evolution of initially circular blobs of tracers , centered on the shearless core of the southern equatorial jet , after 11 jovian days .",
    "the shape of tracer blobs resembles the shape of chevrons , serving as lagrangian footprints of rossby waves identified recently from an eulerian perspective on the southern hemisphere of jupiter @xcite",
    ".    the advected jet core , as a material line , does not allow mixing between the two wings of any chevron .",
    "specifically , the evolving parabolic lcs does act as a transport barrier , keeping its coherence , and showing no wave - breaking or fingering - type deformation .",
    "this coherence effectively blocks the advective excursion of material between the upper and lower half of the material jet .",
    "observational evidence suggests the existence of coherent rings around all jovian vortices , including the grs .",
    "the accepted explanation is that these rings are signs of vertically moving air parcels in the three - dimensional atmosphere of the planet @xcite .",
    "a ring of air parcels is a material transport barrier that is expected to have a two - dimensional footprint in the horizontal wind field around the grs .",
    "such a signature , however , has not been identified in available advection studies ( cf .",
    "section [ sub : prior_work ] )    here we seek an annular material transport barrier region around the grs by applying the geodesic lcs theory described in section [ sub : elliptic - lcss ] .",
    "this necessitates the computation of limit cycles for the family of autonomous dynamical systems defined in eq . .",
    "we discard limit cycles obtained for the same @xmath64 value , if they are within two velocity grid steps from each other .",
    "this is to focus on robust enough limit cycles that are far enough from undergoing a saddle - node bifurcation",
    ".    this computation yields 73 elliptic lcss , computed as robust limit cycles of the differential equation family ( fig .",
    "[ fig : closed_orbits_t0 ] ) .",
    "this set of closed curves forms a generalized kam region , filled with material loops that resist filamentation and act as coherent transport barriers through the entire duration of the underlying video footage .",
    "figure [ fig : grs_t0 ] shows separately the elliptic lcs with perfect coherence ( @xmath96 ) in black , as well as the outermost elliptic lcs in blue that forms the outer boundary of the coherent lagrangian vortex associated with the grs .",
    "this vortex boundary is marked by the parameter value @xmath97 , which forecasts a roughly @xmath98 increase in arclength .",
    "the two closed curves enclose a highly coherent annular barrier , the lagrangian counterpart of the outer ring identified within a collar of the grs described in @xcite .",
    "this outer ring was constructed as the annulus outside the perceived core of the collar , a closed curve of velocity maxima .",
    "our geometric construction of an annular lagrangian transport barrier is also motivated by the visual observations in @xcite .",
    "these often indicate a sharper inner boundary and a more diffusive outer boundary for coherent jovian rings .",
    "the sharp observational boundary suggests an elliptic lcs of the highest possible coherence ( zero stretching ) , while a diffusive outer boundary is expected near an elliptic lcs of the lowest possible coherence ( highest stretching in a family of elliptic lcss ) .",
    "the exact location of these oval barriers is expected to change under varying data resolution . the structural stability in the construction of elliptic lcss , however , guarantees that the barriers move only by a small amount under small enough variations in resolution .",
    "advected images of the extracted grs boundary confirm its sustained coherence over the finite time of extraction ( see ) .",
    "our computation shows that the predicted coherent core of the grs indeed regains its arc - length after 24 jovian days . at the same time",
    ", the coherent outer boundary of the grs indeed grows in arclength by about @xmath98 , while its longitudinal extent decreases by about @xmath99 .",
    "this suggests that the coherent boundary of the grs is becoming rounder , which is generally consistent with the available observational records taken over much longer periods @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : aspect_ratio ] ) . clearly , any firm conclusion or prediction about the long - term behavior of the arclength of material grs boundary would require the analysis of a substantially longer data set .",
    "we have applied the recently developed geodesic theory of transport barriers @xcite to an enhanced video from nasa s cassini mission to jupiter .",
    "first , we obtained a representative two - dimensional wind field from this video via the advection corrected correlation image velocimetry ( acciv ) algorithm of asay ",
    "davis et al . @xcite .",
    "next , we identified , for the first time , unsteady material transport barriers in the wind field that form the cores of zonal jets and the boundary of the great red spot ( grs ) in jupiter s atmosphere .    the parabolic lcss ( lagrangian jet cores ) we have found show that both easterly and westerly jet cores provide strong material transport barriers .",
    "this latter finding confirms the conclusion of beron - vera et al .",
    "@xcite based on a numerical study of a perturbed potential - vorticity - staircase model relevant for jupiter . deforming material blobs placed near the parabolic lcs also reveal the lagrangian footprint of the recently discovered chevron - type atmospheric features @xcite .",
    "the elliptic lcss we identify provide a foliation of the grs into highly coherent , uniformly stretching layers .",
    "this supports the existence of a proposed two - dimensional , cylindrical material transport barrier around the grs @xcite . according to our results , this cylindrical region has finite width , represented by an annulus in our two dimensional analysis .",
    "the annulus has a perfectly coherent ( @xmath96 ) inner boundary and a nearly perfectly coherent outer boundary , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grs_t0 ] . while the outer boundary shrinks in longitudinal extent over the observed 24 jovian days , its total arc - length shows a slight increase of about @xmath98 .",
    "this suggests a modest evolution of this lagrangian boundary towards more perfect circularity , which is in line with longer observational records @xcite .    the time - resolved image reconstruction technique employed here is purely kinematic , and does not incorporate a fit to dynamic equations believed to govern jupiter s wind fields .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to fitting dynamically consistent reduced models to optically reconstructed velocities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these models , however , are steady in a moving frame , and incorporate velocity measurements from different sources and times . here , instead of securing dynamical consistency for an averaged , steady velocity field , we have constructed an unsteady velocity field that is kinematically consistent with a specific observational period .",
    "imposing some degree of dynamical consistency on the optically reconstructed velocity field and comparing it with steady models in a moving frame remains a viable future research direction .",
    "a clear challenge is that the cloud distribution over the grs does not align with the location of its associated potential vorticity anomaly or with any other of the grs s known dynamical features @xcite .",
    "arriving at jupiter in 2016 , the juno mission of nasa will explore some of the material movement deep beneath the planet s clouds for the first time @xcite . using this future information",
    ", we expect to be able to extend some aspects of our present analysis to three - dimensions using recently developed 3d variational lcs methods @xcite .",
    "we envision further applications of the methodology developed here to remotely observed patterns in meteorology @xcite , oceanography @xcite , environmental monitoring @xcite and crowd surveillance @xcite .",
