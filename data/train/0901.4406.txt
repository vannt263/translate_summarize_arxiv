    "interfaces between transition metal oxides attract much attention due to their technological and fundamental importance . in a complex transition metal oxide system , new electronic states at the interfaces between different components",
    "can bring dramatic changes into its physical properties .",
    "the prominent examples are metallic mixed - valence heterostructures of srtio@xmath1 and latio@xmath1 and the quasi - two - dimensional electron gas at the interface between two insulators srtio@xmath1 and laalo@xmath1 with recently discussed superconducting properties @xcite .    in the transition metal oxide heterostructures , the new interfacial electronic states can be driven by the mechanisms of electronic reconstructions @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms involve charge compensation of interface polarity or charge self - doping due to interface chemical abruptness which is one of the ways to maintain the overall electrostatical neutrality of the system @xcite .",
    "besides the well understood scenarios of interface charge doping , other mechanisms of interface reconstructions can play a decisive role in the unusual electronic properties of transition metal systems .",
    "recently the so called orbital reconstruction has been shown to occur at the interfaces between cuprate and manganite films which results in changes of @xmath4 orbital occupancies of the interfacial copper ions @xcite .    the first evidence for the interface orbital reconstruction came from resonant x - ray spectroscopy studies of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8/lacamno@xmath1-heterostructures @xcite .",
    "in these experiments , the x - ray spectral intensity at the interface between yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath8 and la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath1 is found to be similar for the photon polarization in @xmath11-plane and in @xmath12 direction , which is interpreted in terms of the appearance of hole charge in @xmath7 orbitals .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the standard hole doping mechanism where the holes occupy o @xmath13 orbitals of the zhang - rice singlets in cu@xmath14o@xmath15 planes of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath7 orbital reconstruction has been explained by a formation of a new `` extended molecular orbital '' at the oxide interfaces in which a substantial amount of hole charge is distributed over the mn , cu and o orbitals . as is shown in refs .",
    ", the high mn charge @xmath17 results in an electron transfer from mn to @xmath6 orbitals of cu , whereas the cu @xmath7 states become partially occupied .",
    "moreover , in such an electron doped system , the coexistence of two partially occupied @xmath18 orbitals leads to the formation of zhang - rice triplets centered on cu with the total spin @xmath19 .",
    "in contrast , for the hole - doped interfaces , the author in ref .   expects a rather standard @xmath20-singlet character of the electron configuration with a stabilization of triplet states when the hole density is increased . as is shown in ref .",
    ", the singlet character of the electron state can be possibly changed due to structural jahn - teller distortions .    in the present work ,",
    "we explore theoretically a mechanism of the orbital reconstruction occurring through the splitting of @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands by the interface charge redistribution . as an example of a system where the interface - caused splitting of @xmath7 can be obtained within the density functional theory",
    ", we consider a supercell with a cuo@xmath0 layer directly deposited on the top of a srtio@xmath1 slab terminated by sro , a model oxide interface recently studied in refs .   and",
    "shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this model system ,",
    "the electrostatic polarity of the interfaces between cuo@xmath0 and sro could be compensated via the interface self - doping by holes .",
    "like in the bulk yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath16 , in heterostructures the interface self - doped holes in the cuo@xmath0 layers are accumulated predominantly in the o @xmath13 orbitals .",
    "although the charge self - doping mechanism appears to be a common scenario in a wide variety of polar oxide interfaces , a close examination of the electronic structure in the cuo@xmath0/sro region unexpectedly shows that a mechanism different from the electrostatic self - doping plays a key role @xcite .",
    "as appears from the earlier lda+@xmath3 studies @xcite , the relaxation of the interfacial distance @xmath23 between cuo@xmath0 and sro planes results in the optimized value @xmath24    which is by 0.5  smaller than the distance between the apical oxygen o(2 ) and cu in cuo@xmath0 planes of the bulk yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 . for larger interface distances",
    "@xmath25 , the compensation of the polarity proceeds through a standard self - doping mechanism of the electronic reconstruction and leads to an extremely high self - doping level @xmath26 holes / per unit cell which enforces charge neutrality ( cf .",
    "the formal valency of each layer in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , to the left of the block scheme ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the holes are located in o(1 ) @xmath27 orbitals ( top panel , dashed arrows ) , in close analogy to the zhang - rice singlets described by a @xmath28 configuration in the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "in contrast to the unrelaxed interfaces , for the optimized distances @xmath29 the new ( orbital ) mechanism of the compensation of the interface polarity becomes equally important . this new mechanism is associated with a change of the occupancy of one of the @xmath7 orbitals from one to zero due to a `` displacement '' of this band above the fermi level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . from the point of view of classical chemical valence theory ,",
    "the resulting electronic configuration can be formally described as a `` @xmath5 '' state . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the charge and orbital reconstructions caused by the @xmath30-doping level are schematically shown for comparison . formally , a cu @xmath5 configuration corresponds to a change of the valency of cu from @xmath31 to @xmath17 and is typically considered as unstable in the literature .",
    "the expectation of such an instability was the reason for a preference for the standard self - doping reconstruction mechanism in our earlier discussion of the cuo@xmath0/srtio@xmath1 system in ref .",
    "however , a further close and careful examination of the electronic reconstruction in this system shows a more complex scenario which is beyond a simple integer - like change of the electron charge on the copper ion ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , bottom panel ) . in this mechanism",
    ", the modification of the oxidation state of cu can be described by two steps , namely ( i ) by a depletion of electron charge from a @xmath7 band and from the @xmath32 band of o(2 ) ( sro ) , and ( ii ) by an increase of electron density in the @xmath6 orbitals hybridized with o(1 ) @xmath27 states .",
    "these two steps provide jointly a decrease of the net electron charge on cu which is an additional way to compensate the interface polarity .",
    "consequently , in the relaxed structure the electrostatic neutrality is achieved by a combination ( a ) of the standard self - doping mechanism with the self - doped hole charge @xmath33 on o @xmath13 orbitals ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , top panel ) , and ( b ) of the @xmath7 orbital reconstruction which leads to a decrease of the local electron charge on cu ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "= 7.5 cm    let us estimate the crystal field which would be sufficient for stabilization of the new oxidation state formally denoted here as extended cu @xmath5 . using the notations @xmath34 for the majority and minority spin states ,",
    "the @xmath5 state can be described as @xmath35 configuration where the occupied states @xmath36 and @xmath21 have a character of a zhang - rice triplet , similar to the results of ref .  . in the relaxed structure",
    ", this configuration corresponds to the minimum of the total energy . in the lda+@xmath3 calculations , the energy gain @xmath37 due to the relaxation of the interface distance from @xmath38 to @xmath39 approaches @xmath40  ev .",
    "it is remarkable that in the extended cu @xmath5 configuration , the main contribution to @xmath41 is provided by the reconstruction of the electronic states in the nearest cuo@xmath0 and sro planes @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the changes of the @xmath4 orbital energies ; @xmath46 refers to the shifts of the energies of the @xmath13 bands of oxygens o(2 ) . in our calculations ,",
    "the band energies are represented by their gravity centers @xcite . here a gravity center @xmath47 of a band with a density of states @xmath48 is calculated from the expression @xmath49 . as the displacements of the gravity centers of the @xmath13 states of o(1 ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 states of o(2 ) and @xmath52 bands of cu are negligibly small as compared to the splitting of @xmath18 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 bands , they are not included into ( [ detot ] ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    in the sic lda+@xmath3 approach @xcite , the @xmath7 orbital energies in the optimized ( @xmath55 ) and unrelaxed ( @xmath56 ) system can be represented as @xmath57 here @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the spin index . in our calculations , we consider the local coulomb corrections for cu @xmath4 orbitals @xmath60  ev , and the hund coupling @xmath61  ev . in the unrelaxed structure , the states @xmath62 are filled by electrons : @xmath63 . in contrast , in the optimized system , the orbital reconstruction leads to @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the quantities @xmath66 are the corresponding lda orbital potentials which are assumed to be independent of the spin direction . as a consequence ,",
    "the total @xmath7 energy shift for the relaxed structure is given by @xmath67 where the potential difference @xmath68 is determined by the change of the orbital crystal field due to the interfacial relaxation .    from ( [ ez2 ] ) , the change of the splitting of the spin bands @xmath69 and @xmath70 due to structural relaxation",
    "can be described as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the occupation of the ( @xmath73 ) orbital in the optimized ( @xmath55 ) and unrelaxed ( @xmath56 ) system .",
    "the last result demonstrates that the on - site coulomb repulsion controls the spin band splitting and the consequent enhancement of the local magnetic moments .",
    "as the width of the @xmath7 bands exceeds the shift @xmath43 caused by the orbital reconstruction , the use of the centers of gravity to estimate the changes of the crystal fields can not be sufficiently accurate to convey the physical picture .",
    "therefore , we consider a different analysis of these fields . in this approach , we calculate the centers of gravity of the @xmath6 and @xmath74 bands which are expected to be accurate due to their substantial shifts by about @xmath75  ev caused by the crystal field .",
    "the obtained values for @xmath44 and @xmath45 together with the similarly calculated @xmath46 can be directly substituted into the equation ( [ detot ] ) . for the known @xmath41 this equation provides an estimate for the minimal energy @xmath43 @xmath76 which is sufficient for the stabilization of the orbitally reconstructed extended cu @xmath5 configuration . here",

    "consequently , the effect of the interface relaxation on @xmath6 is reduced to a modification of the lda potentials @xmath81 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 . using the results of the lda+@xmath3 calculations",

    ", one can detect that a central feature of the interface relaxation is a strong shift of the center of the minority band @xmath88 down to the energy @xmath89  ev below the fermi level .",
    "the reason for this shift can be understood from the analysis of the band structures of the optimized and unrelaxed interfaces plotted in fig .",

    "this contribution is especially significant at the energies about @xmath90  ev , at @xmath91  ev as well as at about @xmath92  ev .",
    "specifically , the integration of the partial densities of states below the fermi level shows an increase of the population @xmath93 of cu @xmath88 levels by about 0.2 electrons in the relaxed structure . to check the numerical accuracy of this result we have also calculated the increase of the electron concentration from equation ( [ ex2y2 ] ) as @xmath94 with @xmath95 , which agrees well with the value obtained by the direct integration .",
    "besides the @xmath88 state , the relaxation also results in an increase of the population of @xmath36 orbital by about 0.1 electrons , as compared to the system with @xmath96   .    = 8.0 cm    using the values of the band centers given in table  [ tab1 ] ,",
    "we find from eq .",
    "( [ de10z2 ] ) that the minimal energy shift @xmath97 sufficient for orbital reconstruction is given by @xmath98  ev . as the typical values of the crystal fields expected in this type of systems can approach @xmath99  ev",
    ", we can conclude that the mechanism of the orbital reconstruction realized through the stabilization of the extended cu 3@xmath100 configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( bottom panel ) appears to be a plausible scenario .",
    "we note that this reconstruction occurs despite a strong local coulomb repulsion @xmath60  ev which is overcome by the modifications of the structure of the cu @xmath88 and @xmath22 bands .",
    "to understand better the nature of the reconstruction of cu @xmath88 , we also analyze the ( @xmath101 , @xmath12 ) electron density maps ( represented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) in the energy range of the bonding states cu @xmath6-o @xmath13 . here",
    "the @xmath12-axis is directed perpendicular to ( 001 ) .",
    "the decrease of the interface distance @xmath23 leads to stronger electron repulsion in the nearest cuo@xmath0 and sro layers .",
    "the effect of this repulsion is clearly visible in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( @xmath102   ) which shows electron depletion in the spatial region between cu ( located at @xmath103   , @xmath104   ) and oxygen o(2 ) ( @xmath105   ) in the sro - plane .",
    "the decrease of the electron density along the @xmath12-direction has an extended character and involves cu @xmath22 , o(2 ) @xmath106 and ti @xmath22 orbitals which may be interpreted as reduced hybridization between these orbitals . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] this decrease is manifested through a peak centered at @xmath107  ev above the fermi level which appears due to the splitting of the @xmath7 bands .",
    "the peak remains significant even in the density of ti @xmath22 states which are more distant from the interface .",
    "the consequent increase of the difference between the electron occupancy of the majority and minority spin states also leads to the enhancement of the magnetic moment of cu from 0.65  @xmath108 to 0.86  @xmath108 , an effect discussed in the previous section .",
    "= 6.5 cm    in contrast to the electron depletion in @xmath12 direction , in the cuo@xmath0-plane the interface relaxation results in a strong charge hybridization between cu and o(1 ) which is presented in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . to estimate the modification of electron charge resulting from the combination of ( i ) electron depletion across the interface and ( ii ) electron accumulation in cuo@xmath0 planes",
    ", we have calculated planar ( @xmath101 , @xmath109 ) and orthogonal ( @xmath12 ) contributions to the electron density . to obtain the orthogonal part ( i ) ( electron depletion ) ,",
    "we have extracted the charge density in the range between 0.5  ev and 1.4  ev which corresponds to the new dos - peak .",
    "the direct integration of the obtained spatial density profiles results in the value @xmath110 carriers per unit cell .",
    "this value should be corrected by @xmath111 on account of an overlap with the states @xmath6 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 which are shifted towards lower energies in the relaxed system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the integration of the corresponding projected dos parts gives @xmath112 .",
    "it should be noted that the latter integration has been performed without consideration of extra charge in the interstitial regions which should give additional contributions to @xmath111 . in our analysis ,",
    "the interstitial contributions are expected to be small and the resulting @xmath111 does not exceed the maximal value of about 0.450.5 . as a consequence , the obtained modification of the depleted charge density @xmath113 .",
    "this implies that approximately one electron per unit cell is depleted from the @xmath7 and @xmath32 orbitals of the interfacial bonding complex cu - o(2)-ti . in the interfacial stack cuo@xmath0-sro - tio@xmath0 , about 70@xmath114 of the depleted charge is located in the cuo@xmath0 layers which suggests a strong spatial charge confinement to the @xmath7 orbitals of cu .    to calculate the amount of the electrons accumulated in the cuo@xmath0 planes of the relaxed structure ( contribution ( ii ) )",
    ", we performed the integration of the hole charge from the fermi level to the top of the o(1 ) valence band which gives @xmath115 holes .",
    "these holes are located in the @xmath27 states of o(1 ) hybridized with the @xmath6 orbitals of cu .",
    "the comparison with the value @xmath116 for the unrelaxed system provides the resultant amount @xmath117 for the additional electron charge accumulated due to structural relaxation .",
    "it is remarkable that in their combination , both contributions ( i ) and ( ii ) give the total positive charge @xmath31e required for the overall neutrality of the relaxed system .",
    "therefore , in this mechanism for the orbital reconstruction one can distinguish two key factors which are responsible for the stabilization of the extended cu 3@xmath100 configuration near structurally relaxed cuo@xmath0/srtio@xmath1 interfaces : ( i ) the depletion of the electrons from a @xmath7 orbital of cu hybridized with @xmath13 o(2 ) and @xmath7 states of ti , a process caused by the splitting of the @xmath7 bands ; ( ii ) the increase of electron charge density in the cu @xmath88 orbitals which are strongly hybridized with the @xmath27 bands of the oxygens o(1 ) in the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "this increase is accompanied by a shift of the @xmath88 band towards lower energies and it provides the energy gain sufficient for the orbital reconstruction .",
    "it is worth noting that the second stage ( increase of electron concentration on o(1 ) @xmath13 and cu @xmath88 ) in fact counterbalances the electron depopulation in stage ( i ) . in this way",
    ", it minimizes the lost of energy due to the splitting of cu @xmath7 bands with the orbital reconstruction .",
    "the obtained charge self - regulation is in agreement with the negative feedback mechanism discussed in ref .   which supports its general character for the transition metal oxides .",
    "to summarize , we note that in the orbital reconstruction mechanism , the effective change of the valency of cu due to the splitting of @xmath7 bands appears to be a plausible and realistic property . for the cuprate - titanate interfaces ,",
    "the resulting electronic state is characterized by the electronic configuration @xmath35 of cu @xmath4 orbitals extended by the changes of orbital occupancies of ions in the neighbouring sro and tio@xmath0 planes .",
    "surprisingly , the strong hybridization between o @xmath27 and cu @xmath88 states of cuo@xmath0 planes plays an essential role , making even moderate crystal fields acting on cu @xmath7 orbitals sufficient for the orbital reconstruction at cuo@xmath0-sro interfaces and the consequential splitting of the @xmath7 states through the onsite coulomb interaction @xmath3 .",
    "an increase of the magnetic moment of cu ( from 0.65  @xmath108 to 0.86  @xmath108 ) is predicted for the reconstructed interface state .",
