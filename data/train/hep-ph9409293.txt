    "the emc measurements of the longitudinally polarized deep inelastic structure function @xmath4 of the proton@xcite raised the question of the spin distribution among quarks and gluons . in the framework of the `` naive '' parton model the proton spin is expressed in terms of the spin polarization distribution of quarks and antiquarks @xmath5 as @xmath6 in fact , the emc has measured the integral @xmath7 note that @xmath8  const .  in the perturbative regime of qcd because of chiral symmetry arguments .",
    "in combining ( 2 ) with the experimental value of the isovector axial coupling constant @xmath9 known from neutron @xmath10 decay , @xmath11 on the one side , and with the @xmath12 ratio extracted from hyperon @xmath10 decay @xmath13 on the other side , the result is obtained , that the fraction of the proton spin carried by the quarks is surprisingly small ( see @xcite for details ) . the integral in ( 2 ) can alternatively be expressed as a combination of the axial isovector ( @xmath14 ) , axial hypercharge ( @xmath15 ) , and axial flavor singlet ( @xmath16 ) form factors as follows : @xmath17 where ( 5 ) is based on the ( presumably rather strong ) assumption of su(3 ) symmetry leading to the relations @xmath18 the nucleon matrix elements of the axial hypercharge ( @xmath19 ) and flavor singlet ( @xmath20 ) quark currents are normalized according to : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denote the corresponding gell - mann matrices , @xmath23 the nucleon dirac spinor@xcite , and @xmath24 stands for the flavor quark su(3 ) spinor .",
    "the strange axial nucleon form factor @xmath25 is introduced as @xmath26    in the case of a vanishing strange axial form factor , eq .",
    "( 5 ) reduces to the so called ellis - jaffe sum rule@xcite .",
    "now the surprise is the significant deviation of the measured value for @xmath27 from the ellis - jaffe sum rule , attributed to a small flavor singlet axial form factor or , alternatively , to a significant nonvanishing value of @xmath28 .",
    "different scenarios have been discussed in the literature in this respect . here , we would like to point out the one presented in@xcite where due to a non - trival structure of the hadronic vacuum the flavor singlet axial charge is `` eaten '' by instanton effects .",
    "the axial form factors introduced above enter the neutral axial vector current according to ( for details see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath29 here , the notation @xmath30 has been used and the @xmath31 content of the nucleon has been neglected in the last line of ( 9 ) . thus in the light of the proton spin problem , the theoretical investigation of the strange axial nucleon form factor becomes important .",
    "in this study we present a @xmath32-vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model for this form factor and demonstrate the importance of a lowest 1-loop vertex correction .",
    "in the spirit of the vmd ansatz@xcite and in analogy to the @xmath34 dominance of the isotriplet axial current exploited in@xcite we suggest the following representation for the strange axial form factor of the nucleon at low energies : @xmath35 where @xmath36 . here , `` @xmath37 '' and `` @xmath38 '' label respectively the constants related to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons . in ( 10 ) the deviation of the mixing angle between the isoscalar of the octet and the flavor singlet state in the axial vector meson nonet from the ideal mixing angle of @xmath39 has been made explicit according to : @xmath40 the angle @xmath41 has been determined experimentally in@xcite to be @xmath42 .",
    "the latter equation shows that a significant violation of the ozi rule is observed in the axial vector nonet@xcite . by chiral symmetry arguments it is possible to parametrize the coupling constants of the @xmath32 mesons as @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the values for @xmath45 and @xmath46 are taken from@xcite .",
    "dispersion relations with one subtraction have now been assumed for the @xmath47 and @xmath48 strange form factors , respectively , @xmath49    now , the imaginary part of @xmath50 can be calculated from the feynman graphs of fig .  1 by means of the cutkosky rules@xcite .",
    "the most important @xmath33 vertex correction is due to the ( @xmath51 ) decay channel with a @xmath52 branching ratio .",
    "it is especially important for the modification of the one - body isoscalar axial vector current of in - medium nucleons , a fact demonstrated in@xcite .",
    "there it was shown for the case of the fermi gas model that the @xmath53 exchange current reduces the one - body matrix element of the isoscalar axial vector current by about 10% .",
    "the effect is determined by the ratio @xmath54 and acquires importance mainly because of the above mentioned significant violation of the ozi rule in the axial vector meson nonet .",
    "we use the value @xmath55 in accordance with@xcite .",
    "to describe the @xmath56 vertex we use the following effective lagrangian density @xmath57 the value of @xmath58 extracted from the corresponding partial width is up to a sign @xmath59 .",
    "the coupling constant of the @xmath60 meson to the nucleon is identified to that of the scalar - isotriplet channel of the bonn potential@xcite as @xmath61 , and a pseudoscalar form of the @xmath62 vertex is assumed . from the graphs in fig .  1",
    "we obtain for the absorptive part of the @xmath33 form factor the following expressions for its low frequency part ( @xmath63 ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 the high frequency part ( @xmath66 ) is simply obtained from ( [ i m ] ) by replacing @xmath67 by @xmath68 .",
    "it is small for unitarity arguments .    in fig .  2 the ratio of @xmath69 including the vertex contribution to the one ( @xmath70 ) without",
    "is presented . at higher momentum transfers ,",
    "the vertex contribution is on the level of several percent and thus non negligible .",
    "we expect that the @xmath3 triangular vertex correction to the strange axial form factor will increase in case the @xmath71 interaction is included .",
    "the relevant t - matrix amplitude can be evaluated within the framework presented in@xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of our study is that the strong violation of the ozi rule in the axial vector meson nonet implies        j.  ashman et al .",
