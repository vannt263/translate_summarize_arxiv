    "the issue of the existence of massive or critical phases in quantum spin systems has motivated a great deal of study in strongly correlated systems since the seminal work on the haldane conjecture @xcite .",
    "this issue became a central problem when more complicated arrays of spins chains , known as quantum spin ladders , were discovered experimentally in cuprate materials that exhibit high-@xmath0 superconductivity when they are appropriately doped @xcite , @xcite .    from a more fundamental viewpoint ,",
    "the study of critical and massive phases in quantum spin ladders offer the possibility of a testing ground for studying complicated quantum many - body effects , that in some instances underly the physics of unconventional phases of matter @xcite . a variety of spin ladders with different number of legs have been synthesized based on cuprate materials , like @xmath1 , @xmath2 etc . @xcite ,",
    "@xcite or in other family of compounds @xmath3 @xcite , and they present typically antiferromagnetic rung couplings among the legs of the spin ladders .",
    "it is also possible to find materials with less conventional ferromagnetic rung couplings as well like in certain chemical compounds like pnnno and pimno @xcite .",
    "in addition , the new tools to study strongly correlated systems based on optical lattices open the possibility of implementing a variety of quantum spin systems including ladders @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of quantum spin ladders with staggered dimerization was conjectured on the basis of analytical non - perturbative methods @xcite like the non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) complemented with additional information from the weak and strong coupling limits in the rung coupling constants and dimerization parameters . later",
    ", a series of different approximate analytical studies @xcite , @xcite have been favorable for the existence of a critical line in the simplest case of a 2-leg spin ladder with staggered dimerization . also , some preliminary numerical methods with the lanczos algorithm @xcite , @xcite have shown support for this fact for ladders with small size . despite these several studies ,",
    "a complete non - perturbative numerical analysis of these staggered low dimensional quantum spin systems have remained as an open problem .    in this paper",
    "we study a 3-leg quantum spin ladder with different types of rung couplings ( either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ) and different dimerization patterns .",
    "these ladders are complex enough so as to serve as paradigmatic examples for testing the conjectured phase diagrams @xcite . in order to achieve a conclusive answer to the conjectured phase diagrams for this system , we resort to a non - perturbative numerical tool like the dmrg method @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in particular we employ its finite - size version based on the sweeping procedure to improve the convergence of the iterative steps .",
    "the characterization of the different phases separated by the critical lines is performed with a dmrg calculation of generalized string order parameters ( sop ) @xcite that were introduced to distinguish between massive phases in dimerized spin chains @xcite even when the localized spins in the chain take on half - integer values .",
    "these sops are extensions of the originally non - local vacuum - expectation values introduced for integer spins and the like @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the elucidation of the existence of a critical line in the phase diagram of quantum spin ladders with staggered dimerization is not straightforward when the ladders have end points as in the open boundary conditions geometry demanded by the standard dmrg method .",
    "thus , we have to resort to numerical analysis of the low - lying spectrum of excitations in order to extract the correct gap in the bulk of the system when studying the universal properties of these ladders in the thermodynamic limit ( length going to infinity ) @xcite .",
    "the string order parameter is a theoretical construct in condensed matter that allows the characterization of massive phases with a vbs structure .",
    "it has never been measured experimentally . however , with the engineering of optical lattices it would be possible to address a direct measurement of this important quantity @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect.[sect_model ] we introduce the two patterns of dimerization in 3-leg ladders , one being columnar with ferromagnetic rung couplings , while the other is alternating with antiferromagnetic rung couplings . in the former ,",
    "we establish a helpful connection with the @xmath4 antiferromagnetic alternating chain in a certain strong coupling limit .",
    "we recall several conjetures about the phase diagram of both 3-leg heisenberg models @xcite that motivate their study with dmrg in order to clarify them . in sect.[sect_critical ]",
    "we perform the dmrg calculations of the low - energy gaps in both models of 3-leg ladders as a function of the various coupling constants . with this information",
    "we can establish the phase diagram and thus we establish the validity of the conjectured diagram @xcite .",
    "in addition , we can give a precise location of the critical lines and we find qualitative differences between these critical lines in each model . in sect.[sect_phases ]",
    "we introduce generalized string order parameter to characterize the nature of the massive phases separated by the critical lines found in the previous section .",
    "these string orders are measured with dmrg techniques and we show that they are a valuable tool for detecting vbs states in dimerized quantum spin ladders with different patterns of dimerization .",
    "sect.[sect_conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions . in appendix [ sect_appendix ]",
    "we study with dmrg the @xmath4 alternating spin ladder and its generalized string order parameters .",
    "this case appears as a limiting case in the study of the ferromagnetic 3-leg ladder with columnar dimerization and it is used as a guiding example to find the phase diagram .",
    "one of the main interests established in @xcite was the existence of an interplay between 3-leg ladders with a columnar dimerization pattern and ferromagnetic inter - leg , or rung , couplings on one side , and 3-leg ladders with alternating dimerization and antiferromagnetic rung couplings , on the other .",
    "the point was that both arrangements of 3-leg ladders should exhibit critical lines , while neither their precise location was known nor the nature of the massive phases they separated was determined .",
    "this is the open problem that we address here by means of the dmrg method . to this end",
    ", we start introducing both arrays of ladders since they are the candidates to exhibit critical lines .    ) model with alternated staggering and _ b ) _ the ferromagnetic ( @xmath5 ) model with columnar staggering . ]",
    "thus , we are mainly interested in studying a possible connection between two different arrangements of spins @xmath6 forming a 3-leg ladder which interact via heisenberg terms .",
    "both of them combine bonds of different strength parameterized by a constant @xmath7 and two different types of coupling constants , @xmath8 for the heisenberg interaction between spins along the legs , and @xmath9 for similar interactions between the rungs of the legs .",
    "since the physics of the problem depends only on the ratio @xmath10 , the constant @xmath8 will from now on be given a fixed antiferromagnetic value @xmath11 .",
    "the other constant @xmath9 will have positive sign in one of the models and negative in the other one .",
    "in addition to this difference , both models will also differ in the staggering pattern as we shall discuss below .",
    "we next describe the model corresponding to the region with @xmath5 , with the bond alternation pattern such that every one of the three legs begins with a strong bond followed by a weaker one , that is , the bond alternation follows a _",
    "columnar pattern_. the explicit hamiltonian of this arrangement is @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the longitudinal length of the 3-leg ladder , @xmath14 is a spin-@xmath6 operator located at the site @xmath15 of the @xmath16-th leg with @xmath17 , @xmath7 is the dimerization parameter that sets the relative strength of the bonds that interact with heisenberg coupling constant @xmath8 along the leg of the ladder and @xmath9 on the rungs of the legs .    since the coupling among legs is ferromagnetic , we know that for values @xmath18 this model converges to an effective @xmath19 staggered spin chain",
    ". studies with the nl@xmath20 m method predicts @xcite for this chain the existence of three critical points in the interval @xmath21 $ ] placed at @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "numerical studies showed that in fact these points correspond to @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath19 dimerized spin chain gives us valuable information about the expected massive phases of the ladder in the strong ferromagnetic regime , and since there exist some subtleties regarding the string order parameters that may lead to confusion , we have included a numerical study of this chain in appendix [ sect_appendix ] .    for the completely antiferromagnetic regime @xmath26",
    ", we will use another staggering pattern that differs with respect to the previous one . in this case only the first and third leg begin with a strong bond , while the second one begins with a weak one , that is , the bond alternation is not columnar anymore but still follows a regular pattern that is called _",
    "alternating_. the hamiltonian of this model is @xmath27 with the same conventions as before . a pictorial representation of this hamiltonian together with the hamiltonian of the ferromagnetic model",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ ladderpics ] .    with this arrangement ,",
    "it is also possible to effectively and approximately map the model onto a nl@xmath20 m and again this formalism predicts a critical behaviour in the phase diagram of the couplings @xmath10 vs. @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , this behaviour is only reliable in the strong coupling limit @xmath28.s more specifically , it predicts a critical curve running from the point @xmath29 to @xmath30 and another one which is the mirror reflection of the latter with respect to the @xmath9 axis .",
    "these predictions however shall be considered only as qualitative approximations of the real behaviour of the system . in this particular case , it is evident that the critical line must cut the @xmath7 axis exactly at @xmath25 since that point corresponds to two decoupled @xmath31 staggered heisenberg chains . however",
    ", this behaviour is missed by the nl@xmath20 m technique . on the other hand , this model has not apparent limits which can give us a hint on the phases that give raise . in section [ sect_critical ]",
    "however , our dmrg computations will give strong evidence of their nature .",
    "despite the differences in both models , i.e. different sign of @xmath9 and different staggering pattern , there are various features that connect them .",
    "first of all and more important is that at least in the line @xmath25 both models are constinuosly related as we vary @xmath5 to @xmath26 . on the other hand , according to nl@xmath20 m , the first model is critical only in the region @xmath26 while the second one has only critical lines in the complementary part @xmath5 .",
    "this dual - like behaviour combined with the expectation that the ground state of both models is a valence bond solid , rouse the belief about the possibility of establishing a connection among their phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "we shall see to what extend these expectations are fulfilled with the help of the dmrg technique and the generalized string order parameters .",
    "massive quantum phases are characterized by an energy gap from the ground state ( degenerate or not ) to the first excited state . on the contrary critical phases",
    "are characterized by a gapless spectrum between these energy levels .",
    "we have used the finite - size dmrg algorithm to compute the low energy levels and thus the corresponding gaps in order to identify the gap in the bulk of the system when we send the length of the 3-leg ladders to infinity ( thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "it is known that in the case of integer spin chains , some configurations of vbs states can break a hidden @xmath32 symmetry @xcite that makes the ground state degenerate .",
    "this degeneration is a reflection of the spin - end effects in a antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain of @xmath33 spins @xcite . in systems other than the parent hamiltonians of the vbs states , but close enough to this picture and when using open boundary conditions ,",
    "typically this degeneracy is approximate and the energy of the near - degenerate states decays with the size exponentially to a unique infinite volume ground state .     and",
    "@xmath34 are shown only for one value of @xmath9 .",
    "namely @xmath35 ( _ up _ ) and @xmath36 ( _ down _ ) .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    fig .",
    "[ gap_xy ] shows the energy differences between the ground state and two first excited states in both models and .",
    "we observe in this figure that @xmath37 accounts for the degeneracy mentioned in the previous paragraph : in the completely antiferromagnetic model the first excited state is clearly above the ground state in the phase corresponding to low values of @xmath7 , while it is degenerate in the rest of the @xmath7 interval . on the contrary ,",
    "the ground state of the ferromagnetic model is degenerate for low values of @xmath7 while it has a finite gap in the rest . as for @xmath38",
    ", it corresponds in fact to the gap of the spectrum in the degenerate regions while it clearly differs from the gap @xmath37 in the non degenerate regions . finally , the energy difference @xmath34 coincides in both regions and both models with the gap of the massive phases .",
    "this holds true up to slight deviations due to finite size effects and irrespective of the degeneracy of the ground state , thus , we may conclude that this gap @xmath34 is in fact the same one that survives when using periodic boundary conditions .    as mentioned in the previous section , the existence of critical lines ( characterized by a gapless spectrum ) in both models and is supported by arguments coming from the strong coupling limit in the case of model , and nl@xmath20 m valid in both of them .",
    "these arguments are however not conclusive . in this section",
    "we will prove numerically that these lines exist and we give an accurate estimation of its shape and location . to this end",
    ", we will find the critical values @xmath39 that make the gap @xmath40 vanish .",
    "it is very important at this point to emphasize that an exactly vanishing value of the gap shall only be attained in the thermodynamic limit . for finite size systems ,",
    "the magnitude of the gap remains finite and gets closer and closer to zero as we increase the size . in our case however , critical points are separating massive gapped phases and therefore , for large enough sizes but still computationally feasible , the gap at these points attain a local minimum value and can be accurately computed .     and alternated staggering , and model with @xmath5 and columnar staggering .",

    "we have used the finite dmrg algorithm in ladders of @xmath44 sites . for the completely antiferromagnetic model we retained @xmath42 states of the density matrix and a lanczos tolerance equal to @xmath45 .",
    "the ferromagnetic model turned out to be numerically more demmanding and we set @xmath43 and the tolerance equal to @xmath46 .",
    "two sweeps of dmrg were enough in both models to make the energies converge .",
    "these results clearly confirm the conjectured phase diagrams for these 3-leg models @xcite .    the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ critical_lines ] are only a guide for the eye .",

    "in this section we will characterize the quantum phases that appear in the phase diagram in fig.[critical_lines ] . to achieve this goal , we will resort to the generalized string order parameter @xcite , @xcite , which are able to detect the vbs state character of dimerized spin systems even when the local spins take on half - integer values .",
    "these parameters are generalizations for arbitrary complex phase of the original string order @xcite , @xcite parameter first proposed for the case of integer spin @xmath33 . resorting to the vbs picture ,",
    "massive phases corresponding to valence bond solids can be denoted according to the number of valence bonds formed with the contiguous sites , i.e , one particular valence bond solid can be denoted as @xmath54-vbs with @xmath55 .    for instance , we have already mentioned in the previous section that in the strong coupling limit , the columnar dimerized 3-leg ladder effectively becomes a @xmath4 alternating spin chain .",

    "indeed , we can observe that the string order parameter is clearly non - vanishing above @xmath74 , the critical point of the chain .",
    "as for the region below this point , the tendency of the string order parameter is to decay to zero as we increase the size of the system , except for the point @xmath25 and its vicinity .",

    "the rise of the string order parameter for large distances @xmath62 close to the total lenght @xmath13 is expected due to finite size effects . for values far enough of the edges the tendency of the string order parameter is however to vanish as expected increasing the distance @xmath62 .",
    "a regards the shape of these parameters for arbitrary @xmath79 , fig .",
    "[ sop_theta1 ] shows @xmath112 for two different values of @xmath7 below and above the critical point.from the knowledge that we have of the phases of the chain we can see that this order parameter behaves as pointed out in @xcite and the number of zeros identifies the valence bond phase ocurring . in effect , for values @xmath113 the number of vanishing values in @xmath114 is two and coincides with a @xmath82-vbs while for @xmath115 there are three null values corresponding to the @xmath84-vbs phase .    on the other hand @xmath116",
    "is plotted for various values of @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ sop_theta2 ] .",
    "two features can be remarked of this parameter : it also shows a qualitative change in its shape as we move from one phase to the other . in this case",
    "however the relation of the number of zeros with the nature of the phase is not clear .",
    "besides , the characteristic scale of the parameter differs significantly in both phases ."
