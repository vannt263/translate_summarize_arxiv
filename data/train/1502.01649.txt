    "the recently discovered standard model ( sm ) higgs boson is most likely the first of a family . indeed , after the historic higgs discovery by the lhc experiments  @xcite it is more than ever natural to imagine that the beh mechanism  @xcite is also the one responsible for generating all masses in particle physics , including those of neutrinos  @xcite extra higgs scalars are also expected in order to account for the existing cosmological puzzles , such as dark matter and inflation , as well as to realize natural schemes of symmetry breaking , such as those based on supersymmetry .",
    "here we focus on neutrino masses .",
    "these are expected to arise from the exchange of some heavy messenger states which , depending on the underlying mechanism , need not be too heavy  @xcite . if lepton number is broken through a singlet vacuum expectation value  @xcite there is a physical pseudoscalar nambu - goldstone boson  the majoron .",
    "all majoron couplings to sm particles are very small except , perhaps , those with the higgs boson . as a result",
    "the cp even higgs scalars have sizeable `` invisible '' decays , for example ,  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the associated pseudoscalar goldstone boson  the majoron .",
    "the coexistence of such novel decays with the sm decay modes affects the higgs mass bounds obtained  @xcite , as well as provide new clues to the ongoing higgs boson searches at the lhc .",
    "current lhc data suggest that the new particle discovered with a mass @xmath2 gev  @xcite is indeed the long - awaited for standard model ( sm ) higgs boson ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this places restrictions on the extended higgs sector providing neutrino masses , which we now analyse .",
    "we find that , despite the data accumulated so far at the lhc , the possibility of having an invisibly decaying higgs boson is not too tightly constrained .",
    "experimental searches have been mainly motivated by dark matter models where the higgs might decay into the dark matter candidate , say @xmath4 , if its mass is @xmath5 , such as supersymmetric models with r - parity conservation . however , invisible higgs boson decays appear most naturally in low - scale models of neutrino mass generation . in these models",
    "neutrino masses arise from the spontaneous breaking of an additional @xmath6 global symmetry associated to lepton number in the theory .",
    "this symmetry is broken when a lepton - number - carrying scalar singlet @xmath7 gets a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "there are many genuine low - scale neutrino mass scenarios of this type  @xcite , such as inverse  @xcite or linear  @xcite seesaw schemes . for simplicity , however , one may take the simplest extension of neutrino mass generation , namely the type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite . in this case in order to account for the small neutrino masses one must assume very small dirac - type yukawa couplings .",
    "the important consequence of spontaneous breaking of lepton number is the appearance of a physical goldstone boson  @xcite , and the decays in eq .",

    "the scalar sector , in the simplest scenario , contains only one @xmath9 scalar doublet @xmath10 and a singlet @xmath7 , called 12-model in  @xcite .",
    "hence there are three physical spin zero states , the two massive cp - even scalars @xmath11 and @xmath12 and one massless pseudo - scalar , the majoron @xmath13 . assuming the ordering @xmath14 the most interesting case is when @xmath15 . in this letter",

    "we describe the main features of the symmetry breaking sector of the 12-model .",
    "we present our results in section iii , and we discuss how the main features of this simplest model can also be present in other schemes with additional experimental signatures in section iv .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "the simplest way to model spontaneous lepton number violation contains , in addition to the usual sm higgs doublet @xmath10 , @xmath20 a complex lepton - number - carrying scalar singlet @xmath7 that acquires a non - zero vev @xmath21 that breaks the global @xmath22 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this scalar gives majorana mass to right - handed neutrinos , while @xmath10 couples to sm fermions .",
    "this structure defines the simplest type - i seesaw scheme with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "many other scenarios sharing the same symmetry breaking sector can be envisaged though , for definiteness , we assume the simplest type - i seesaw .",
    "the scalar potential is given by  @xcite @xmath23 the singlet @xmath7 and the neutral component of the doublet @xmath10 acquire vacuum expectation values @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",

    "the points generated must fulfill several constraints .",
    "first come the consistency requirements for the scalar potential , namely that it must be bounded from below and that perturbative unitarity be respected .",
    "the unbounded from below constraint reads  @xcite @xmath59 while for the unitarity we just take a simplified approach requiring that all couplings are less than @xmath60 .",
    "certainly this can be refined  @xcite , though eq .",
    "( [ eq : theory - bounds ] ) is sufficient for our current purposes .",
    "the second type of constraints comes from the lep collider .",

    "however , in this simple model , if we take into account the discovery at the lhc of a higgs boson at 125  gev the parameter space is further restricted .",
    "in fact , in this picture the heavier higgs boson couples to the @xmath35 boson with a reduced strength @xmath77 . the restriction on @xmath77",
