    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been immensely successful in describing a  vast amount of experimental data at energies up to @xmath2(100)gev  @xcite .",
    "one of the major implications is that in the quark sector flavor - dependent new interactions beyond the sm can readily be ruled out if they give rise to substantial flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "this motivates the formulation of the principle of so - called minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) , which postulates that the sources of all fcnc and @xmath3 violation reside in sm renormalizable yukawa couplings defined at tree level  @xcite .",
    "the mfv framework offers a predictive and systematic way to explore new physics which does not conserve quark flavor and @xmath3 symmetries .",
    "the implementation of the mfv principle for quarks is straightforward , but for leptons there are ambiguities , as the sm by itself does not predict lepton - flavor violation .",
    "since there is now compelling empirical evidence for neutrino masses and mixing  @xcite , it is of interest to formulate mfv in the lepton sector by incorporating ingredients beyond the sm that can account for this observation  @xcite .",
    "however , we lack knowledge regarding not only the origin of neutrino mass , but also the precise nature of massive neutrinos",
    ". they could be dirac fermions , like the electron and quarks , as far as their spin properties are concerned .",
    "alternatively , neutrinos being electrically neutral , there is also the possibility that they are majorana particles . the mass - generation mechanisms and yukawa couplings for the neutrinos in the two cases differ significantly .",
    "since the mfv hypothesis is closely associated with yukawa couplings , one expects that the resulting phenomenologies in the two scenarios are also different .    in the majorana neutrino case ,",
    "there have been studies in the literature on some aspects of mfv realizations in various seesaw scenarios  @xcite , especially in the well - known simplest models of types i , ii , andiii@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we take another look at these three seesaw schemes to investigate the contributions of new interactions organized according to the mfv principle .",
    "we adopt a model - independent approach , where such contributions consist of an infinite number of terms which are built up from leptonic yukawa couplings and their products .",
    "it turns out that the infinite series can be resummed into only 17 terms  @xcite .",
    "this formulation allows one to have a much more compact understanding of the terms that pertain to a given process .",
    "we find that for the specific processes to be considered only a few of them are relevant .",
    "we apply this to extract lower limits on the scale of mfv in the three seesaw scenarios using the latest experimental data , including the existing bounds on flavor - violating leptonic processes and the most recent measurements of neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "also , we will examine the similarities and differences among the three seesaw types in relation to their mfv phenomenologies .",
    "we demonstrate especially that in types i and iii there are features which can bring about potentially remarkable effects which do not happen in type ii .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the mfv framework for leptons in the case that neutrinos are dirac fermions . in section  [ mfvseesaw ]",
    ", we discuss the implementation of the mfv principle in scenarios involving majorana neutrinos with masses generated via the seesaw mechanism of types i , ii , and  iii .",
    "this is applied in section  [ dipole ] , where we explore some of the phenomenology with effective dipole operators involving leptons and the photon .",
    "we evaluate constraints on the mfv scale associated with these operators from currently available data on flavor - violating radiative decays of charged leptons , @xmath0 conversion in nuclei , flavor - violating three - body decays of charged leptons , and their anomalous magnetic moments and electric dipole moments . with our numerical results",
    ", we illustrate some striking differences among the three seesaw types . in section",
    "[ sec : ex - op ] , we look at several other leptonic operators satisfying the mfv principle .",
    "one of them can cause flavor - violating decay of the higgs boson , which is testable at the lhc .",
    "we make our conclusions in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "let us begin by describing how to arrange interactions under the mfv framework for leptons assuming that neutrinos are of dirac nature .",
    "following the mfv hypothesis that renormalizable yukawa couplings defined at tree level are the only sources of fcnc and @xmath3 violation , we need to start with such couplings for the neutrinos and charged leptons .",
    "we slightly extend the sm by including three right - handed neutrinos which transform as @xmath4 under the sm gauge group @xmath5su(2)@xmath6u(1)@xmath7 .",
    "the lagrangian responsible for the lepton masses can then be written as @xmath8 where summation over @xmath9 is implicit , @xmath10 are yukawa coupling matrices , @xmath11 represents left - handed lepton doublets , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote right - handed neutrinos and charged leptons , @xmath14 is the higgs boson doublet , and @xmath15 involving the second pauli matrix  @xmath16 . under the sm gauge group , @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14",
    "transform as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the mfv hypothesis@xcite implies that @xmath20 is formally invariant under the global group u(3)@xmath6u(3)@xmath21u(3)@xmath22u(1)@xmath6u(1)@xmath21u(1)@xmath23 with @xmath24(3)@xmath6su(3)@xmath21su(3)@xmath23 .",
    "this entails that @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 belong to the fundamental representations of the su(3)@xmath25 , respectively , @xmath26 and under @xmath27 the yukawa couplings transform in the spurion sense according to @xmath28    taking advantage of the requirement that the final effective lagrangian be invariant under  @xmath27 , without loss of generality one can always work in the basis where @xmath29 is diagonal , @xmath30 with @xmath31gev being the higgs s vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , and @xmath32 , @xmath12 , @xmath33 , and @xmath13 refer to the mass eigenstates .",
    "consequently , one can express @xmath11 and @xmath34 in terms of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata neutrino mixing matrix @xmath35  as @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the light neutrino eigenmasses and in the standard parametrization  @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the dirac @xmath3-violation phase , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "based on the transformation properties of the fields and yukawa spurions , one then uses an arbitrary number of yukawa coupling matrices to put together @xmath42-invariant objects which can induce the desired fcnc and @xmath3-violating interactions .",
    "thus , for operators involving two lepton fields , the pertinent building blocks are @xmath43 for these to be @xmath27 invariant , the @xmath44 s should transform according to @xmath45 since @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 must be hermitian , @xmath49 must be hermitian as well . to be acceptable terms in the lagrangian , the above objects should be combined with appropriate numbers of other sm fields into singlets under the sm gauge group , with all the lorentz indices contracted .",
    "the mfv principle dictates that these @xmath44 s are built up from the yukawa coupling matrices @xmath50 and  @xmath51 .",
    "let us first discuss a nontrivial @xmath44 which transforms as @xmath52 under @xmath27 and consists of terms in powers of @xmath53 both of which also transform as @xmath52 .",
    "formally , @xmath44 is a sum of infinitely many terms , @xmath54 with coefficients @xmath55 expected to be at most of  @xmath56(1 ) . under the mfv framework",
    ", these coefficients must be real because otherwise they would introduce new sources of @xmath3 violation beyond those in the yukawa couplings . with the cayley - hamilton identity @xmath57 + \\openone{\\rm det}x$ ] for an invertible 3@xmath583 matrix  @xmath59",
    ", one can resum the infinite series into a limited number of terms  @xcite , @xmath60 where @xmath61 stands for the 3@xmath583 unit matrix .",
    "though one starts with all @xmath62 being real , the resummation process generally renders the coefficients @xmath63 in eq.([general ] ) complex due to imaginary parts created among the traces of the matrix products @xmath64 with @xmath65 after the application of the cayley - hamilton identity .",
    "the imaginary contributions turn out to be reducible to factors proportional to a jarlskog invariant quantity , @xmath66 $ ] , which is much smaller than unity  @xcite .    with eq.([general ] ) , one can devise the objects in eq.([deltai ] ) .",
    "thus , the first of the hermitian combinations can be @xmath67 . to obtain nontrivial  @xmath68",
    ", one can take @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the construction of @xmath71 can be carried out in a similar way , except @xmath72 and @xmath73 are replaced by @xmath74 and @xmath75 . since @xmath76 and @xmath77 are diagonal , so are any powers of them .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 do not produce any fcnc and @xmath3-violation effects .",
    "we end this section by mentioning that the above discussion can be easily applied to the quark sector with the renormalizable yukawa lagrangian given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 are yukawa coupling matrices , @xmath80 represents left - handed quark doublets , and @xmath81 @xmath82 denote right - handed up - type ( down - type ) quarks .",
    "these fields transform as @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , respectively , under the sm gauge group @xmath86 . in the basis where @xmath87 is diagonalized , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix which has the same standard parametrization as in eq.([pmns ] ) . for mfv interactions , employing @xmath79 along with @xmath90 and @xmath91 as building blocks , one can construct objects such as @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , which are the quark counterparts of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and  @xmath97 , respectively @xcite .",
    "if neutrinos are majorana particles , the yukawa couplings that take part in generating their masses differ from those in the dirac neutrino case and depend on the model details . in this section",
    "we discuss how to realize the mfv hypothesis in the well - motivated seesaw models .",
    "the seesaw mechanism endows neutrinos with majorana mass and provides a natural explanation for why they are much lighter than their charged partners .",
    "if just one kind of new particle is added to the minimal sm , there are three different scenarios @xcite : the famous seesaw models of type i , type  ii , and type iii .",
    "a crucial step in the implementation of mfv in a given model is to identify the quantities @xmath72 and @xmath73 in terms of the relevant yukawa couplings .",
    "this will be the emphasis of the section .",
    "in the type - i seesaw model , the sm is slightly expanded with the inclusion of three gauge - singlet right - handed neutrinos , @xmath98 , which each carry a lepton number of 1 and are allowed to possess majorana masses  @xcite .",
    "the renormalizable lagrangian for the lepton masses is @xmath99 where @xmath100 contains the right - handed neutrinos majorana masses , breaking lepton - number symmetry , and @xmath101 , the superscript c referring to charge conjugation .",
    "accordingly , the masses of the neutral fermions make up the 6@xmath586 matrix @xmath102 in the @xmath103 basis , where @xmath104 .",
    "if the nonzero elements of @xmath105 are much greater than those of @xmath106 , the seesaw mechanism becomes operational  @xcite , resulting in the light neutrinos mass matrix @xmath107 where now @xmath35 contains the diagonal matrix @xmath108 multiplied from the right , with @xmath109 being the @xmath3-violating majorana phases .",
    "it follows that @xmath34 in eq.([ynud ] ) is no longer valid , and one can instead pick @xmath34 to be  @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a matrix satisfying @xmath112 . since @xmath111 can be complex , it is a potentially important new source of @xmath3 violation besides @xmath35 .",
    "another implication of the presence of @xmath105 is that it will introduce an additional source of flavor violation if the masses @xmath113 of the right - handed neutrinos , @xmath98 , are unequal@xcite . in that case , the extra flavor spurions should generally be taken into account by adding their contributions to @xmath44 ineq.([general ] ) .",
    "however , if @xmath98 have the same mass , @xmath114 , no new terms will need to be included in eq.([general ] ) . in our treatment of the type - i seesaw with mfv ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to this least complicated possibility that the right - handed neutrinos are degenerate .",
    "it follows that in this instance the flavor symmetry is@xcite @xmath24(3)@xmath6o(3)@xmath21su(3)@xmath23 , under which @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is an orthogonal real matrix .",
    "moreover , from eq.([ynum ] ) with @xmath118 and @xmath111 being real or complex@xcite @xmath119 whereas @xmath120 in eq.([abd ] ) is unchanged .",
    "these matrices are to be incorporated into the mfv objects mentioned earlier , such as @xmath121 .",
    "we note that , since @xmath122 , here @xmath123 is no longer diagonal , but it pertains only to @xmath124 interactions .",
    "now , in the dirac neutrino case , @xmath72 is given by eq.([abd ] ) and therefore has tiny elements .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath125 is sufficiently large , the eigenvalues of @xmath72 in eq.([ai ] ) can be sizable . nevertheless , since as an infinite series @xmath44 has to converge",
    ", @xmath125 can not be arbitrarily large  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in numerical work we require the biggest eigenvalue of @xmath72 to be unity , which implies that the elements of @xmath73 are comparatively much smaller .",
    "the type - ii seesaw model extends the sm with the addition of only one scalar su(2)@xmath126 triplet given by  @xcite @xmath127 which transforms as @xmath128 under the sm gauge group @xmath86 .",
    "accordingly , the lagrangian describing the yukawa couplings of leptons is @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "it respects lepton - number conservation if @xmath131 is assigned a lepton number of @xmath132 . after",
    "the vev of the neutral component of @xmath131 becomes nonzero , @xmath133 , one obtains in @xmath134 the neutrino mass matrix @xmath135 in the basis where the charged lepton s yukawa coupling matrix , @xmath29 , has been diagonalized . if the nonzero elements of @xmath136 are of @xmath2(1 ) , the tiny size of neutrino masses then comes from the suppression of @xmath137 due to certain choices of the parameters in the scalar potential @xmath138 .",

    "one gets @xmath144 and @xmath145 , the first equality simplifies to @xmath146 like in the sm , and with the additional conditions @xmath147 and @xmath148 the second relation in eq.([vvt ] ) translates into @xmath149 which is small if @xmath150 .",
    "this turns into the seesaw form @xmath151 if @xmath152 , but the prerequisites just mentioned do not preclude a scenario with a relatively lighter triplet , in which @xmath153 can be as low as the tev level  @xcite , provided that @xmath154 .",
    "since the triplet couples to sm gauge bosons , a nonzero @xmath137 will make the @xmath155 parameter deviate from unity  @xcite , @xmath156 its empirical value @xmath157  @xcite then implies , at the 2@xmath158 level , that @xmath159gev .",

    ", one observes that the lagrangian in eq.([lmii ] ) possesses formal invariance under the global group u(3)@xmath6u(3)@xmath161u(1)@xmath6u(1)@xmath23 , with @xmath162(3)@xmath6su(3)@xmath23 , if @xmath163 and @xmath164 belong to the fundamental representation of @xmath165 , respectively , @xmath166 and the yukawa couplings are spurions transforming according to @xmath167 here the building block @xmath44 still has the expression in eq.([general ] ) , with @xmath120 being the same as in eq.([abd ] ) , but unlike before @xmath168 where from eq.([yt ] ) @xmath169    it is interesting to notice that @xmath72 in eq.([aii ] ) is the same as its dirac - neutrino counterpart in  eq.([abd ] ) , up to an overall factor . due to this difference , whereas the elements of the latter are tiny , those in eq.([aii ] ) can be of @xmath170 if @xmath137 is similar in order of magnitude to the neutrino masses .",
    "this will in fact be realized in our numerical analysis , as we will again choose the largest eigenvalue of @xmath72 to be unity , which amounts to imposing @xmath171 .",
    "compared to eq.([ai ] ) in the type - i case , @xmath72 in eq.([aii ] ) is in general much simpler . in particular , it no longer depends on the majorana phases in @xmath35 which have canceled out due to @xmath172 being diagonal and does not involve the @xmath111 matrix which can supply potentially major extra effects including @xmath3-violating ones @xcite .      in the type - iii seesaw model ,",
    "the new particles consist only of three fermionic su(2)@xmath126 triplets  @xcite @xmath173 which transform as @xmath174 under the sm gauge group @xmath86 .",
    "the lagrangian responsible for the lepton masses is then @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the charge conjugate of @xmath177 . for convenience ,",
    "we define the right - handed fields @xmath178 and @xmath179 and left - handed fields @xmath180 and @xmath181 . in terms of matrices containing them and sm leptons",
    ", one can express the mass terms in @xmath182 after electroweak symmetry breaking as @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are 3@xmath583 matrices and @xmath186 .",
    "for @xmath187 in their nonzero elements , a seesaw mechanism like that in type i becomes operational to generate the light neutrinos mass matrix @xmath188 hence it is tempting simply to write @xmath189 in a similar way to @xmath34 in type i , @xmath190 and use @xmath29 in eq.([ye ] ) like before .",
    "one , however , needs to justify this approximation because the light charged leptons , @xmath191 , mix with the heavy ones , @xmath192 , as can be deduced from eq.([type3mass ] ) .",
    "they are related to the mass eigenstates @xmath193 and @xmath194 by @xmath195 this alters @xmath35 in eq.([ys ] ) to @xmath196 as well as @xmath29 to @xmath197 . at leading order  @xcite , @xmath198 and @xmath199 for @xmath200 .",
    "thus , the deviations of @xmath201 from the unit matrix are negligible , and the approximation of @xmath189 in eq.([ys ] ) is justified .    since @xmath202 in eq.([lmiii ] ) would introduce an additional source of flavor violation if the fermion triplets had unequal masses , in our treatment of type iii with mfv , like in typei , we restrict ourselves to the less complicated possibility that these fermions are degenerate , @xmath203 . accordingly",
    ", here we only need to work with @xmath204 and , as in the previous scenarios , @xmath73 in eq.([abd ] ) , which are no different from those in type i , where @xmath111 may be real or complex@xcite .",

    "having set up the basics of the mfv realizations in the minimal seesaw models of types i , ii , and iii , we now study some of the phenomenological implications and point out possible differences among them .",
    "it is clear from the last section that as far as mfv phenomenology is concerned type i and type iii will be virtually alike because , with the new fermion masses being far above the tev level , the building blocks for the quantity @xmath44 are the same in both cases .",

    "more specifically , we evaluate constraints on the mfv scale @xmath215 associated with leptonic dipole operators from the latest experimental information on flavor - violating @xmath260 decays , nuclear @xmath0 conversion , flavor - violating three - body decays of charged leptons , muon @xmath222 , and the electron s edm .",
    "we find that the existing data , especially the bound on @xmath261 , can restrict the lower limit on @xmath215 to over 500@xmath160tev or more , depending on the details of the seesaw scheme .",
    "in types i and iii , this corresponds to the new fermions responsible for the seesaw mechanism being super heavy , with masses roughly of order @xmath262gev . on the other hand",
    ", it is interesting to point out that in type ii , although the vev of the scalar triplet needs to be @xmath263ev in our approach , its mass does not have to be @xmath262gev and can be as low as a few hundredtev .",
    "if @xmath153 is to be within lhc reach , in the tev range , @xmath137 has to be of @xmath2(10@xmath160ev ) instead . another major difference between type",
    "i ( or iii ) and",
    "type ii is that in the former the yukawa couplings of the new fermions contain features which can have substantially enhancing effects , including @xmath3-violating ones , and which do not exist in type ii .    beyond the dipole operators , we look at additional dimension - six operators that involve only leptons or couple them to the sm gauge and higgs bosons .",
    "since these operators contribute to the flavor - changing three - body decays as well , the associated mfv scale must satisfy their experimental bounds .",
    "based on the resulting strongest constraints , we estimate predictions on some of these processes which are markedly distinguishable from the corresponding predictions from the dipole operators .    it is interesting that one of the extra operators can also contribute to the flavor - conserving and flavor - violating leptonic decays of the higgs boson and is therefore subject to constraints from future higgs measurements at the lhc which will continue to improve in precision",
    ". upcoming searches for other processes that violate lepton flavor will offer complementary tests on the various operators in the different seesaw scenarios we have studied .",
    "the examples we have presented serve to illustrate the great importance of making such experimental efforts .",
