    "the disorder induced metal - insulator transition , namely , the anderson transition,@xcite corresponds to a fixed point in a real - space renormalization transformation . approaching the critical point from an insulating phase , the localization length @xmath1 increases and diverges at the critical point .",
    "since the length @xmath1 is a unique characteristic length near the transition point , there is no length scale characterizing the critical state .",
    "this implies that the wavefunction at the anderson transition point ( the critical wavefunction ) is scale invariant .",
    "in fact , aoki @xcite and wegner @xcite have demonstrated that critical wavefunctions have multifractal properties which can be described by an infinite set of exponents .",
    "these exponents are quite important because they define not only spatial distribution of wavefunction amplitudes but also dynamical properties of the electron system at criticality.@xcite    among various works in which exponents characterizing multifractality of critical wavefunctions have been extensively studied , @xcite numerical multifractal analyses based on the box - counting method give the most reliable values of exponents at the present stage , except for a few exactly - solvable problems .",
    "@xcite however , values of exponents reported so far widely fluctuate .",
    "for example , the correlation dimension @xmath0 for the three - dimensional anderson model takes values ranging from @xmath2 @xcite to @xmath3.@xcite these fluctuations result mainly from the following reasons .",
    "one is a finite - size effect which can be excluded in principle by a finite - size scaling .",
    "another reason is related to _ anomalously localized states _",
    "( als)@xcite at the critical point .",
    "statistical properties of als in a metallic phase have been studied well .",
    "@xcite specific local configurations of disorder in a finite spatial region may lead to electron states localized within this region , while the average disorder is weak compared to the critical disorder .",
    "although such als induced by statistical fluctuations of disorder configurations remain even if the system is infinite , they do not contribute to ensemble - averaged properties of amplitude distributions of wavefunctions or transport properties in the metallic phase .",
    "this is because als have point - like spectra , while metallic ( extended ) states have continuous ones .",
    "als also appear at the critical point.@xcite the localization length of a multifractal wavefunction diverges in an infinite system at the critical point , while sizes of als are finite .",
    "in contrast to the case of metallic phases , it is not obvious that als can be neglected in infinite systems at the critical point .",
    "the effect of als is much stronger than that in metallic phases .",
    "however , fundamental knowledge on , e.g. , a probability to find als or influences of als to critical properties , are still unclear because of the lack of a quantitative definition of als .",
    "it is important to clarify how strong als affect critical properties by defining als quantitatively and revealing their fundamental features .    in the present paper ,",
    "we give a quantitative and practical definition of als at criticality suitable for numerical investigations . in order to define als ,",
    "it is natural to evaluate spatial extend of wavefunctions .",
    "quantum states with localization lengths less than the system size are regarded as als in a finite system .",
    "this definition is , however , not appropriate for precise and systematic calculations , because we can not determine which wavefunctions are more multifractal if localization lengths of two wavefunctions are both close to the system size . we show that the correlation function of box - measures of multifractal critical wavefunctions @xcite works quite well for the definition of als . in order to demonstrate how als influence critical properties of the anderson transition",
    ", we examine the distribution function of the correlation dimension @xmath0 of critical wavefunctions .",
    "results presented here urge us to reconsider our picture of als .    the efficiency of our definition of als is demonstrated by applying them to critical wavefunctions in two - dimensional electron systems with spin - orbit interactions ( symplectic systems ) , which exhibit the anderson metal - insulator transition . for ensuring the multifractality of typical critical wavefunctions even in a short - range scale",

    "section  [ sec:6 ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this section , we propose a quantitative definition of als based on a multifractal analysis . for this purpose , we give some definitions of basic quantities and exponents used in the multifractal analysis . at first , we introduce a quantity @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 [ or @xmath7 in continuous systems ] is the box measure of wavefunction amplitudes .",
    "the summation @xmath8 ( or the integral @xmath9 ) is taken over sites @xmath10 ( or the spatial region ) within a small box @xmath11 of size @xmath12 , and the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is taken over such boxes .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 is the order of the moment @xmath14 . for a multifractal wavefunction",

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , the mass exponent is given by @xmath18    since als are not multifractal , it seems possible to define als by calculating deviations of the moment @xmath14 from the power law eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "however , the moment @xmath14 represents simply the average of @xmath19 [ except for a trifling prefactor @xmath20 , and does not describe the multifractal correlation of box measures .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath14 is not sensitive to als and eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is insufficient for the definition of als",
    ". this will be demonstrated by showing an example in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "the correlation function @xmath21 defined below can describe the box - measure correlations:@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the box measure of a box @xmath24 of size @xmath12 fixed distance @xmath25 away from the box @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) is the number of boxes @xmath26 [ or @xmath24 ] , and the summation @xmath30 is taken over all such boxes @xmath24 .",

    "( [ eq:8 ] ) , the quantitative and expediential definition of als at criticality is presented by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a criterial value of @xmath46 to distinguish als from multifractal states and chosen appropriately as demonstrated later .",
    "in this paper , the efficiency of the above definition of als and the effect of als will be demonstrated for an ensemble of wavefunctions at the anderson metal - insulator transition .",
    "for this purpose , the effect of scaling corrections due to irrelevant fields which is a finite - size effect and independent of the als should be reduced as much as possible . therefore ,",
    "considering the advantage of system sizes , we focus our attention on the anderson transition in two - dimensional electron systems with strong spin - orbit interactions , in which systems have no spin - rotational symmetry but have the time - reversal one .",
    "hamiltonians describing these systems belong to the symplectic ensemble .",
    "several models @xcite have been proposed so far to represent the symplectic systems .",
    "although the ando model @xcite has been most extensively studied , relatively large scaling corrections make it difficult to distinguish the als effect .",

    "et al._@xcite proposed the su(2 ) model belonging to the symplectic class , for which scaling corrections are negligibly small .",
    "while the su(2 ) model is rather mathematical , we believe that presented results are qualitatively the same with those for other systems exhibiting the anderson transition .",

    "<S> anomalously localized states ( als ) at the critical point of the anderson transition are studied for the su(2 ) model belonging to the two - dimensional symplectic class . giving a quantitative definition of als to clarify statistical properties of them , the system - size dependence of a probability to find als at criticality </S>",

    "<S> it is found that the probability _ increases _ with the system size and als exist with a finite probability even in an infinite critical system , though the typical critical states are kept to be multifractal . </S>",
    "<S> this fact implies that als should be eliminated from an ensemble of critical states when studying critical properties from distributions of critical quantities . as a demonstration of the effect of als to critical properties , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the distribution function of the correlation dimension @xmath0 of critical wavefunctions becomes a delta function in the thermodynamic limit only if als are eliminated . </S>"
