    "we created the effective area files with arfgen-1.44.4 tool within sas distribution , using the calibration information available in march 2002 .",
    "for the background estimate , we used the blank sky data ( lumb et al .",
    "2002 ) extracted at the same detector coordinates as the source spectra , using the same count rate criteria in the @xmath9 10 kev band as for the data .",
    "we limit our spectral analysis to 0.3  7.0 kev band to ensure that at low energies the source signal level is more than 10 times above that of the background and 5 times at the highest energies .",
    "this is needed to avoid any errors in the background subtraction , as explained below .",
    "we use the 12  14 kev ( pn ) and 10  12 kev ( mos ) band of source and background data to normalize the background to correspond the background level during the cluster observations . here",
    "we effectively assume that any excess background has the same spectral shape as the blank sky .",
    "while the spectra due to the possible residual soft proton flares may be different from the blank sky spetrum , the above assumption has no effect on our results : owing to the adopted criteria for the ratio of source to background levels , the typical background variation by 10  20 % leads to smaller than 5% variations in the background subtracted data , i.e. below the level of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the blank sky data were obtained with a thin filter , while coma and a3112 observations were made with the medium filter .",
    "although the effective area of pn for the thin filter is 50% higher than that for the medium filter at 0.3 kev , the difference reduces to 1% at 1 kev , then the small background at low energies results in a maximum oversubtraction of less than 5% at all energies .",
    "we binned the spectra to achieve at least 20 counts per bin , and further required that the energy resolution ( fwhm ) is oversampled by less than a factor of 3 .",
    "we determined this resolution at different energies by using xspec to fold a narrow gaussian at a given energy and measuring the energies where the redistributed counts drop below 0.5 of the peak value . at @xmath10 0.5 kev",
    "this is not feasible due to strong deviation of the energy re - distribution function from the gaussian shape , i.e. even if the fwhm was small , the broad shoulders distribute the counts much further .",

    "because of the possible problems with the calibration of the spectral response of pn and mos , we first seek a way of characterizing the hot component without relying on the continuum .",

    "these lines cover a very narrow band ( @xmath4 300 ev ) at 6 - 7 kev at these redshifts and thus are quite insensitive to the details of the effective area function .",
    "the energy resolution of pn ( @xmath4 150 ev fwhm ) at 6 kev is adequate to resolve these lines separately . also , the number of the line emission photons in coma and a1795 ( @xmath41000 ) renders the ratio measurable in these clusters .      to obtain a model for the line flux ratio as a function of temperature",
    ", we used the xspec model mekal and pn responses to simulate spectra for a grid of temperatures with a step size of 0.1 kev , keeping metal abundance at 0.3 of solar value , and normalization fixed to unity in xspec units .",
    "since the fluxes of the fexxv and fexxvi lines have the same dependence on the metal abundance , as well as on the overall model normalization ( emission measure ) , the flux ratio is independent on these parameters .",
    "moreover , the exposure time used in the simulations was large enough to ensure negligible statistical errors .",
    "we then modeled the continuum of the simulated spectra with a bremsstrahlung model , fixing the temperature to that used for the simulation , and fitting the normalization using the data in energy intervals of 5  6 and 9  10.5 kev .",
    "we then modeled the data in 6  7.5 kev band using the bremsstrahlung model fixed as above and adding two gaussians for the fexxv and fexxvi lines .",
    "we used the best fit models to obtain the fluxes of the gaussians ( in photons @xmath34 s@xmath7 ) and consequently determined the theoretical flux ratio of these two emission lines as a function of temperature ( see fig.[liner_mod.fig ] ) .",
    "the change in relative abundance of fexxv and fexxvi ions with temperature is reflected in the above curves , resulting in a decreasing flux ratio of fexxv - to - fexxvi emission lines with increasing temperature , from value of 14 at 4 kev to unity at 11 kev . at low temperatures",
    "the model ratio is very sensitive to the variation in temperature ( between 4.0 and 4.5 kev the ratio chages from 14 to 10 ) while it is less sensitive at high temperatures ( between 10.5 and 11.0 kev the ratio changes from 1.1 to 1.0 ) .",

    "we chose to use these narrow bands instead of the full spectra in order to minimize the dependence on calibration accuracy . indeed , using 2.0  7.0 kev band for the fit leads to slightly larger fexxv - to - fexxvi ratio , but the corresponding variation in temperature is negligible . furthermore , using only the narrow band around the iron lines results in a best fit that better describes the line shapes , because of the higher relative importance of the line photons in the @xmath45 sum .",
    "we defined the fexxv line flux as fexxvi line flux multiplied by a constant and allowed this constant to vary , together with the fexxvi normalization , thereby giving the line flux ratio directly .",
    "we let also all the bremsstrahlung parameters vary , as well as the gaussian widths and line centroids .",
    "in the error analysis , the above parametrization of the line ratio takes properly into account parameter correlations . when searching for the best fit , line centroids were allowed to vary due to possible gain calibration inaccuracies , but the best fit values are virtually the same as predicted . in the error analysis of the spectrum in 2  5  region of a1795 , the model has too much freedom compared to the quality of the data , resulting in a complicated @xmath45 distribution .",
    "thus , for the line ratio error analysis , we fixed the line energies to the best fit values for all spectra , but this had only effect in the outer part of a1795 .",
    "the best fit models are shown in fig .",
    "[ liner_data.fig ] and the corresponding temperature values are reported in table [ t.tab ] . at 90% confidence",
    "the constraints of the flux ratio for coma within radii 0513  are 1.6@xmath15 and 2.2@xmath15 and for a1795 within radii 025  they are 5.6@xmath46 and 4.2@xmath47 .",
    "the relative uncertainties of the line flux ratio range between 3070% without no trend as a function of temperature , since the strengths of the two lines behave in opposing ways when varying the temperature .",
    "however , as seen above , at lower temperatures the model is much more sensitive to temperature , i.e. at low temperatures a similar variation in line ratio corresponds to smaller variation in temperature than at high temperatures .",
    "thus , similar observable constraints in line ratio lead to better constraints in the model temperature in a1795 , compared with coma . at the lowest temperatures ( 4 kev )",
    "the fexxvi line is weak and in case of a3112 it reaches the level of noise and thus the flux ratio of a3112 is uninformative .",
    "the resulting temperature values are discussed further in section [ isot ] .",
    "we then modeled the whole 0.3 - 7.0 kev energy band data of pn with a single mekal model ( mewe et al , 1995 ) absorbed by an hi column density ( ) obtained with a fine beam aperture ( 20   , murphy et al . in prep . ) , except for a3112 , for which only the wide beam ( 1@xmath48 ) value is available .",
    "we modeled the data without systematic errors , resulting in unacceptable fits ( see table [ system.tab ] and fig .",
    "[ coma_ratio.fig ] ) . between 0.5 and 1.0 kev",
    "there is a systematic positive deviation of the data from model at the 5  10 % level .",
    "between 1 and 4 kev there are negative residuals at the 10% level and above 4 kev the positive residuals increase monotonically , reaching 20% at 7 kev .",
    "such large excursions are not consistent with the current understanding of the pn calibration ( e.g. briel , 2001 ; kirsch , 2002 ) . thus the 10% and 20% residuals , respectively at 2  3 kev and above 5 kev disagree strongly with the reported residuals of a few % at 2  7 kev band using bright point sources with power - law spectra .",
    "addition of 5% systematic errors ( see e.g. griffiths et al . 2002 ; kirsch 2002 ; snowden et al",
    ". 2002 ) to the whole band leads to improvement of the fits , but yet still not to an acceptable level for all regions in the 3 clusters ( see table [ system.tab ] ) .",
    "thus , at least one of the components involved in the above analysis , i.e. isothermal model ,  from radio measurements or the adopted calibration information , must be wrong .",
    "a possible source of the above residuals is application of the incorrect absorption to the isothermal emission model . to test this scenario",
    ", we allowed the  to vary as a free parameter and obtained statistically acceptable fits to pn data .",
    "however , the resulting values are consistent with zero and significantly below the hi column densities measured by narrow beam ( 20  ) radio observations at 21 cm wavelengths , where the typical uncertainty is @xmath4 @xmath49 @xmath34 ( murphy et al . in prep . ) .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by assuming that towards the central 13  ( coma ) and 5(a1795 and a3112 ) cluster regions studied in our work , the galactic  is by 0.5 - 2.0 @xmath50 atoms @xmath34 smaller than that within the central 20  region covered by the radio measurements .",

    "the residuals above the hot thermal model in the 0.3  2.0 kev band exhibit differences at 5% level of the model between pn and mos , consistent with the calibration residuals ( e.g. briel 2001 ) .",
    "this , as a fraction of the soft excess flux maybe large enough to prevent accurate parametrization of the soft component .",
    "we thus proceed by modeling pn and mos data separately , keeping the hot component parameters fixed to the values found above , and allowing a second mekal emission component to account for the soft excess . by comparing the output obtained from pn and mos data we can estimate the level of low energy calibration uncertainties .",
    "the resulting fits ( table [ ther.tab ] ) are statistically acceptable ( see table [ mekal_pow.tab ] ) , with reduced @xmath45 values below unity , indicating that the adopted 5% systematic error in the fits is an overestimate of the real calibration residuals .",
    "the pn and mos data give consistent results for the temperature and metal abunbance at all cases .",
    "attributing the small offsets in pn and mos values to systematic errors , rather than random noise , we take the average values of pn and mos as best values in each radial bin , and include both pn and mos statistical uncertainty intervals in the final errors of the temperature , metal abundance and the luminosities . note that the normalization differences between pn and mos are included in the uncertainties of the luminosities and they dominate over the effect of the statistical uncertainties of the parameters of the very precisely determined hot component , which were thus ignored in the reported luminosity values .    the results ( see fig .",
    "[ soft.fig ] ) indicate that the soft component has similar temperatures of 0.6 - 1.3 kev in different clusters inside 0.5 h@xmath0 mpc .",
    "the metal abundances are low , below 0.15 solar within uncertainties and in most cases consistent with zero .",
    "xspec simulations indicate that the metal abundance of 0.05 of a typical best - fit model can be recovered to a good accuracy , i.e. strong emission lines can not be altogether removed by the instrumental redistribution of counts .",

    "mpc the 0.2 - 2.0 kev luminosities are consistent within the two cooling flow clusters a1795 and a3112 , both being six times higher than in coma .",
    "the 0.2  2.0 kev luminosities per metric area of the warm component increase by a factor of @xmath98 between 0.2  0.5 and 0 - 0.2 mpc in a1795 and a3112 .",
    "interestingly , the hot component behaves the same way , producing constant warm - to - hot component luminosity ratio in a given cluster in 0.2 - 2.0 kev energy band 0.5 h@xmath0 mpc , although a variation by a factor of 2 is allowed by the errors .    by holding the temperature of the hot component at the line ratio values , and normalizing the model to that of 2  7 kev flux ,",
    "one obtains slightly smaller temperatures for the soft component of coma , but nevertheless consistent with the ones presented above .",
    "further , by letting all the parameters of the hot and warm components vary , one does not arrive at significant difference in the properties of the soft component from the ones presented above .    as an independent check for the existence of the soft excess in these clusters",

    "since most of the reduced @xmath103 values for the thermal fits are below unity , this implies an overestimate of the systematic errors .",
    "if the calibration were better than the 5% level , and thus smaller systematic error would affect the model , the thermal fits would probably yield reduced @xmath103 values of unity , and the power - law fits would all become unacceptable .",
    "thus , although for the moment a firm conclusion of the nature of the soft excess is not available , the thermal model is preferred .",
    "we use the pn and mos averaged best - fit thermal models obtained above to derive physical properties of the warm and hot components ( see table [ results.tab ] ) . for the estimate of the electron density , we assume that the observed emission measure originates from a spherical shell of constant density with radii equal to those of the annuli for which the spectra were extracted .",
    "the resulting densities of the warm component are similar in different clusters at the same radii ( 2 - 4 @xmath104 atoms @xmath3 at 0 - 0.2 h@xmath0 mpc and 0.6 - 0.7 @xmath104 atoms @xmath3 at 0.2 - 0.5 h@xmath0 mpc ) , corresponding to overdensities of 1000 - 200 ( in terms of the critical density ) .",
    "the cooling time scale can be estimated using bremsstrahlung cooling function since the line emission is negligible due to the apparent low abundances . using @xmath105 we obtain cooling times larger or comparable to the hubble time .",
    "the pressure of the ideal ( warm ) gas , @xmath410@xmath106 erg @xmath3 is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the hot gas .",
    "in galaxy clusters coma , a1795 and a3112 , the hot intracluster gas as determined by modeling the 2  7 kev pn and mos data is consistent with that inferred from the fexxv - fexxvi line ratio .",
    "this lends confidence to our method of characterizing the hot component by using the 2  7 kev band . the expected emission spectrum from this component at lower energies",
    "may then be computed and compared with the data , during which a significant warm emission component at a level above the systematic uncertainties becomes evident .",
    "the non - thermal origin of the phenomenon can not be ruled out at the current level of calibration accuracy , but the thermal model fits the data better .",
    "the warm gas is found to have temperatures of 0.6  1.3 kev inside 0.5 h@xmath0 mpc , consistent with the 90% distribution of the temperature values in warm hot intergalactic medium whim simulations ( dave et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "within 0.2 and 0.5 h@xmath0 mpc , the derived electron densities ( @xmath4 10@xmath107 @xmath3 ) are marginally consistent with the simulations , but in the cluster cores the derived densities are too high compared to those given by the simulations .",
    "this indicates that while whim may be a viable explanation for the soft excess at the outer regions of the clusters , it can not explain the soft excess phenomenon entirely .",
    "while the luminosities of the hot component in coma , a1795 and a3112 vary substantially , those of the warm component outside the cool core region are consistent in the three clusters being considered .",
    "the similarities suggest a common origin for the warm component , independent of the hot gas and its cooling .",
    "the derived values for the pressure of the hot component along the central 0.5 mpc line of sight towards coma , a1795 and a3112 are an order of magnitude higher than those of the warm gas , suggesting that they are not in contact .",
    "these requirements can be satisfied in a whim scenario where filaments do not penetrate the clusters , but rather form an external network . in this scenario ,",
    "the density of the hot gas in clusters drops faster with radius than that of the whim filaments . indeed , in bonamente et al .",
    "( 2002 ) the rosat pspc data pointed to a radial increase of the soft excess .",
    "thus , at @xmath4 1 h@xmath0 mpc the pressure equipartition may be attained and stable structures like filaments may be maintained . outside the center , the homogenous distribution of filaments , projected in the cluster direction , produces constant luminosity per mpc@xmath108 in different clusters .",
    "one could argue that the central warm component is a result of a cooling flow .",
    "however , we note that the central brightness peak is not softening ; rather the warm and hot component luminosities are enhanced by a similar factor compared to the outer parts - this is different from the standard cooling flow model where the spectral peak shifts sharply towards low energies in the center .",
    "also , the cooling flow model does not explain the existence of the warm gas outside the cooling radii , as noted in this work .",
    "likewise , the existence of warm gas at the center of coma can not be explained by cooling , since the temperature of the hot gas is the same inside and outside the core region of coma . on the other hand",
    ", we already mentioned that in the center of a1795 and a3112 the hot gas cools and the luminosities of the warm and hot gas are enhanced - such phenomena are absent in coma .",
    "this suggests ( in the context of the filament model described above ) that 1 ) the central line of sight intersects similar amount of whim gas in projected filaments , giving a basic level of radiation ( @xmath4 1 @xmath5 10@xmath109 erg s@xmath7 mpc@xmath110 ) common to all clusters ; 2 ) emissions resulting from any cooling of the central hot gas are reprocessed by the overlying layers of warm gas .",
