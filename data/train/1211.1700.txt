    "with the experimental achievement of realizing the synthetic gauge field in ultracold neutral atoms @xcite , there has been an intensive search for the emergence of exotic quantum phases @xcite .",
    "so far , both abelian and non - abelian gauge fields have been realized for quantum gases using the two - photon raman process @xcite .",
    "the realized non - abelian gauge field leads to a particular spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , which can be regarded as an equal - weight combination of rashba and dresselhaus soc .",
    "schemes of generating various other types of soc have been proposed ( e.g. , @xcite ) and are under active experimental investigation .",
    "previous theoretical studies have shown that the interplay between soc and effective zeeman field ( induced by the same laser fields and/or real magnetic fields ) can lead to intriguing quantum states with nontrivial topological properties .",
    "however , the conditions under which such states can be realized have not been met in current experiments so far .    in this paper , we focus on the two - body properties of a degenerate spin-1/2 fermi gas subject to spin - orbit coupling and effective zeeman field .",
    "the bound states formed by two fermions subject to soc have been studied rather intensively @xcite . however , in previous studies , the interplay between the soc and the zeeman field has not been thoroughly investigated .",
    "we show in the present work that , in the absence of two - body interaction , such a system exhibits zero total momentum .",
    "by contrast , in the presence of attractive @xmath0-wave interaction and with a proper combination of the soc and the zeeman field , the system may form a dimer bound state with _",
    "finite _ center - of - mass mechanical momentum . at first sight",
    ", this result is very surprising since the @xmath0-wave interaction is manifestly momentum - conserving .",
    "a closer examination will reveal that this is a natural consequence of the broken galilean invariance due to the presence of the soc @xcite . in principle , this finite - momentum dimer state can be realized in the current experimental system with equal - weight combination of rashba and dresselhaus soc .",
    "the momentum of the bound state can be measured through standard time - of - flight techniques .",

    "the explicit forms of @xmath21 can also be found , which we list in appendix  [ seca ] .",
    "we now apply this general formalism to the experimentally realized system whose single - particle hamiltonian takes the following form : @xmath22 here @xmath23 and @xmath24 are field operators for hyperfine spin states @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 is the two - photon raman coupling strength and @xmath29 the recoil momentum of the raman beams , which is taken to be along the @xmath30 axis .",

    "notice that it is the soc that breaks spatial reflectional symmetry such that @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "however , for @xmath56 , one still has the symmetry @xmath83 as measured in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ; with finite @xmath31 , this symmetry between @xmath84 and @xmath85 is further broken .",
    "the momentum distribution for the interacting system can be obtained using the same time - of - flight technique as we mentioned earlier .",
    "however , before the atoms are released , one needs to turn off the interaction via , e.g. , feshbach resonace , so that the time - of - flight images provide momentum information for the initial bound state .",
    "note that for either @xmath86 or @xmath56 , we obtain @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in either of these cases ,",
    "both @xmath89 and @xmath90 will be finite , but they have equal magnitude and opposite sign and hence the total momentum of the dimer @xmath91 .",
    "when both @xmath53 and @xmath31 are non - zero , we obtain finite @xmath68 and moreover @xmath92 .",
    "our numerical calculation shows that , under such circumstances , @xmath93 .     as a function of @xmath94 ( momentum along the @xmath30 axis ) for different values of zeeman field strength , from top to bottom @xmath95 and @xmath96 for all curves .",

    "( c ) @xmath68 as a function of @xmath99 at @xmath100 . ]",
    "this situation , combined with the results for the non - interacting system , leads to the following peculiar phenomenon : in the absence of two - body interaction , the system possesses zero total momentum ; when the interaction is turned on , the system picks up a finite total momentum even though the interaction hamiltonian ( [ int ] ) seems to be momentum - conserving .",
    "this peculiarity is indeed a salient feature of the soc .",
    "since the linear momentum of the atom is intimately coupled to its ( pseudo- ) spin , as the interaction induces redistribution of atomic population ( i.e. , changes the value of @xmath101 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) and ( f ) , it also modifies the total momentum of the system .",
    "this phenomenon can be regarded as a manifestation of the broken galilean invariance , which is also responsible for other unusual behaviors such as the deviation of dipole oscillation frequency in a harmonically trapped system @xcite , and the ambiguity in defining landau critical velocity in spin - orbit coupled condensates @xcite .",
    "the momentum of each spin species can be readily measured in experiment using the time - of - flight technique .",
    "this has actually been performed in a non - interacting soc fermi gas @xcite .",
    "however , our calculation shows that @xmath68 is only on the order 1% of recoil momentum for the equal rashba - dresselhaus soc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) which is the only type of soc realized so far .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath68 , however , can be greatly enhanced under other soc scheme . as an example , we consider the spherical soc coupling scheme that is recently proposed @xcite .",
    "for this case , the soc strength @xmath102 .",
    "we take the spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath103 to be the same as in the previous case . due to the isotropic nature of the soc term",
    ", the direction of the zeeman field is irrelevant .",
    "we choose it to be along the @xmath30-axis , i.e. , @xmath104 , which , as we shall show , leads to a dimer state with finite moment @xmath105 along the @xmath30-axis .",
    "[ fig3](a ) demonstrates that , with increasing @xmath31 , the minimum of of the bound state energy @xmath106 deviates away from zero to some finite value .",
    "compared to the former equal rashba - dresselhaus soc case , an essential difference here is that a two - body bound state can be realized even when @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "[ fig3](b ) and ( c ) show how @xmath68 varies as functions of @xmath31 and @xmath12 .",
    "as one can see , as long as @xmath31 is non - zero , the dimer ground state possesses finite momentum .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of @xmath68 can reach as high as @xmath108 .",
    "such a large value should be easily detected in experiment .    finally , for the sake of completeness , we comment on the case of rashba soc with @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in this case , when an in - plane zeeman field ( i.e. , with a component in the @xmath72-@xmath73 plane ) is present , the resulting dimer bound state will again have finite momentum . a plot similar to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] can be obtained .",
    "our calculation shows that the maximum @xmath68 can be reached is about @xmath111 .",
    "in summary , we have studied the two - body properties of a degenerate spin-1/2 fermi gas subjected to spin - orbit coupling and effective zeeman field .",
    "we show that , two fermions , via @xmath0-wave scattering , may form a dimer bound state with @xmath112 center - of - mass mechanical momentum , under proper configuration of so coupling and zeeman field .",
    "we attribute this peculiar phenomenon to the broken galilean invariance induced by the so coupling and special role played by the zeeman field .",
    "we have directly solved the two - body schrdinger equation in the general formalism , and considered the momentum distribution in the laboratory frame for the experimentally realized system , where finite but relatively small bound state momentum @xmath68 is found .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that the recently proposed system with spherical soc @xcite can result in dimer bound state with up to @xmath113 of the recoil momentum .",
    "note that , for bosons , previous studies have shown in the presence of soc , ground state is either plane wave phase or standing wave phase @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to our work , such states possess exactly _ zero _ mechanical momentum . in a many - body setting",
    ", our two - body calculation is relevant in the limit where most of the atoms form tightly bound pairs .",
    "when this limit is not reached , we still expect that the interplay between soc and zeeman field may lead to an exotic superfluid state .",
    "for instance , as a direct analog of the finite - momentum dimer , the many - body system may support finite - momentum cooper pairs @xcite reminiscent of the fulde - ferrell state studied in the context of fermi gases with spin imbalance .",
