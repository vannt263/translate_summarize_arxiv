    "this feeding region within several arcseconds contains x - ray emitting gas , but some x - rays are expected from a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) or synchrotron source from accretion at several schwarzschild radii @xmath6 .",
    "the study of x - rays offers a unique opportunity to test the full range of accretion scales from several @xmath7 to @xmath8@xmath7 and construct a single model .    modeling the accretion flow with such a huge range of scales",
    "is a challenge .",
    "3d sph simulations are performed in the outer region between @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "latest mhd simulations @xcite are limited to @xmath11 orders of magnitude in radius and axial symmetry . only the one - dimensional calculation @xcite can in principle resolve the flow everywhere .",
    "thus , 1d modeling is the approach we adopt extending it down to the bh horizon .",
    "we analyze the quiescent observations @xcite of x - ray emission from central several arcseconds around sgr a * in  [ s_obs ] .",
    "the total exposure is 25 times longer compared to previously analyzed data @xcite .",
    "the super - resolution processing based on spacecraft dithering helps resolving sub - pixel scales .",
    "the up - to - date data on stellar wind emitters are summarized in  [ s_winds ] .",
    "we smooth matter ejection rates of individual stars over radius and sum them into a single feeding rate , also properly averaging the wind velocity .",
    "this presents a significant improvement over an ad - hoc feeding in @xcite .",
    "the dynamical two - temperature equations are derived in  [ s_dynam ] .",
    "we consider the electron conduction the main energy transport mechanism , approximating the unsaturated heat flux by a simple formula .",
    "the bondi flow @xcite without heat transport overestimates the x - ray luminosity by a factor of @xmath12 the other important effects considered are the relativistic heat capacity of electrons and superadiabatic heating equivalent to entropy production .",
    "the ways to solve the resulting system of equations and corresponding results are presented in  [ s_sol ] .",
    "we employ the shooting method and find the minimum @xmath13 fit for x - ray surface brightness profile , simultaneously fitting @xmath3  ghz flux .",
    "the best fit model requires x - ray point source .",
    "the viability of a non - cooling radial flow is examined .",
    "central several arcseconds of the galaxy were observed quite often over the past several years .",
    "the rich region contains point sources identified as x - ray binaries @xcite and extended emission features @xcite together with the source coincident with sgr a*. the latter is expected from hot accreting gas , and source confusion is practically impossible @xcite .",
    "sgr a * source exhibits significant x - ray flares associated with the ssc mechanism @xcite or synchrotron @xcite .",
    "we are interested in quiescent emission , so we exclude the flaring state .",
    "we bin the observations in @xmath14 seconds as a compromise between the time resolution and the number of counts . about @xmath15 photons on average",
    "are received during @xmath14 seconds and we take only the observations with less than @xmath16 photons , thereby accumulating @xmath17  ks in the quiescent state .",
    "the quiescent state also produces some point source x - rays , likely associated with ssc @xcite .",
    "we model these by a psf - broadened central point source .",
    "we eliminate the emission from the point sources and bright extended sources offset from sgr a * ( see figure  [ fig_image ] ) .",
    "the bright extended emission may arise from the colliding winds of two strong close emitters or from the collision of hot outflowing material with cold molecular material .",
    "we exclude both effects from modeling of an averaged flow pattern .",
    "we construct the surface brightness profile in counts per pixel squared for the duration of observation as a function of distance from the bh .",
    "the size of chandra pixel is @xmath18 which may seem to pose a limit on radial binning of brightness profile .",
    "however , the position of satellite is not steady over the duration of observations , but is findable with the @xmath19 accuracy by comparing with the known positions of bright point sources",
    ". then we can achieve @xmath19 super - resolution accuracy in surface brightness profile from knowing the orientation of the detector pixels at any given time .",
    "the final profile is shown on figure  [ fig_model ] ( error bars ) together with the point - spread function ( psf ) ( dashed ) found from the nearby point source j174540.9 - 290014 @xcite .",
    "the psf is scaled to match the contribution from the point source .",
    "the counts cease to be monotonic at about @xmath20 due probably to the production of x - rays in collisions of cold and hot regions .",
    "therefore , only radiation within the central @xmath20 is to be modeled .",
    "as we are interested in how symmetric the surface brightness profile is , we divide the emitting region into @xmath15 sectors @xmath21 each centered on sgr a * and extract the surface brightness profile in each sector .",
    "the standard deviation of counts between sectors is below @xmath22 the noise within @xmath23 but rises to several @xmath24 outward from @xmath25 this justifies our choice of the outer radiation boundary and proves the applicability of the radial model .",
    "let us now look in more details on manufacturing of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the galactic center region has a concentration of massive wolf - rayet and blue giant stars , expelling strong winds from their surfaces @xcite . as the strongest wind emitters are usually the brightest stars , all wind emitters are easily identifiable .",
    "we take the latest data on ejection rates and velocities @xcite and complement them with the orbital parameters of stars @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we minimize eccentricities for the stars not belonging to the stellar disks as identified by @xcite .",
    "the wind speeds @xmath26 and ejection rates are taken directly from @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to treat the winds .",
    "@xcite performed a simulation with winds from steady stars , whereas @xcite considered moving stars . in both cases the time to reach the quasi - steady solution @xmath27  yrs is comparable to or longer than the orbital period at the stagnation point @xmath28  yrs .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to average over stellar orbits in a search for a steady - state prescription of feeding .",
    "we reconstruct the full 3d orbits , but retain only the apocenter and pericenter distances for the stars .",
    "we smooth the total wind ejection rate for each star over the radial extent of its orbit and then smooth with the narrow gaussian filter to eliminate the divergences at the turning points .",
    "we add the resultant feeding profiles together to obtain the total feeding rate as a function of radius ( see figure  [ fig_feed ] ) .",
    "we square average the wind velocities weighing the contribution of each star by its mass loss rate .",
    "however , the winds also acquire the velocity of a star as viewed by a distant observer .",
    "we neglect stars proper motions in calculations of wind energy",
    ". they are negligible at several arcseconds , but would rather contribute to the angular velocity of matter within @xmath29 where feeding is dominated by few stars .",
    "the dependence of the averaged wind speed on radius is shown on figure  [ fig_feed ] .",
    "@xcite assumed the power - law mass injection rate @xmath30 for @xmath31.$ ] the power - law index @xmath32 corresponds to zero slope of @xmath33 ( see figure  [ fig_feed ] ) and agrees better with the present calculations , whereas their choice of constant wind velocity does not agree with the present estimate .",
    "we also incorporate s02 star @xcite into the calculations .",
    "the mass loss rate @xmath34 of s02 is taken to coincide with that of @xmath35 sco .",
    "s02 has a spectral type @xmath36 and a mass @xmath37 @xcite , whereas @xmath35 sco has a very close type @xmath38 and a mass @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the inferred accretion rate onto the black hole @xcite @xmath40 is actually smaller than @xmath41 thus the whole accreted material can in principle be provided by a single weak wind emitter .",
    "this result is very different from @xcite , who assumed all the matter accretes from the inner boundary of the simulation , thus obtaining in a simplified treatment a much larger accretion rate .",
    "however , the direct feeding mechanism @xcite by s02 does not work , as its revised @xmath42 is much below the value required for feeding without the angular momentum . in turn",
    ", the direct feeding by irs 13e3 @xcite produces too large accretion rate in the absence of conduction .",
    "radiatively inefficient flows can be mediated significantly by the energy transfer from the inner regions to the outer @xcite .",
    "such transfer happens in two distinct ways : via convection or via diffusive energy transport .",
    "convection is seen in numerical simulations .",
    "it happens via alfven instability @xcite and magneto - thermal instability ( mti ) @xcite and modifies the density profile .",
    "let us show that the electron heat conduction wins over convection in the accretion flow .",
    "first , the mti is driven by thermal conduction , at any moment the electron conduction flux is larger then the mti - induced heat flux .",
    "convection implies the motion of large - scale magnetized eddies , which in turn split into smaller eddies and develop the whole turbulent cascade . in such settings the electron conduction",
    "is only inhibited a factor of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the speed of electrons is a factor of @xmath44 larger than the sound speed and the convection is subsonic ; the same factor lowers the ion diffusive heat transport .",
    "the relative strength of convective heat flux is proportional to the gradient of logarithmic entropy , which is normally weaker than the proportionality to the gradient of logarithmic temperature of conductive flux . combining both effects",
    "we conclude that , if there is convection or diffusion , then there is stronger conduction .",
    "severe inhibition of electron conduction happens , if the turbulent cascade does not develop and mixing is absent .",
    "this is not the case when the gas accretes .",
    "the strength of turbulent magnetic field increases then in the convergent flow leading to dissipation and effective mixing @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to think that the whole turbulent cascade develops and the electrons relatively freely find their way around magnetic field lines to connect the different regions of the flow .",
    "when the electrons and ions get decoupled from each other , the ion entropy may get equilibrated by convection , whereas the electron temperature levels due to conduction .",
    "the investigation of this possibility is left for future research . in present paper",
    "we take the energy transport to happen solely via electron conduction .",
    "there are several different regimes of conduction .",
    "first , the collisionality of the flow changes from the large radii to the inner radii as the mean free path of particles @xmath45 exceeds the flow size @xmath46 .",
    "as the flow gets only weakly collisional at several arcseconds , the conductivity is well approximated by a collisionless formula with @xmath47 another assumption of the kind deals with the electron velocity . as electrons",
    "can get only mildly relativistic , we take conductivity to be proportional to square root of electron temperature @xmath48 instead of proportionality to relativistic electron velocity @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "when the gradient of electron temperature gets too large , the electrons transport heat via a constant saturated flux , instead of the flux proportional to the gradient of temperature @xcite .",
    "we check a posteriori that the flow is in an unsaturated heat flux regime .",
    "finally , we have for the heat flux @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the electron density @xcite .",
    "gravitational energy of gas in the potential of an accretor is the ultimate inflow driver .",
    "it gets transformed directly in several types : kinetic energy of bulk toroidal and radial motion , energy of turbulent magnetic and velocity fields , thermal energy .",
    "turbulent energy can also originate from the toroidal shearing flow in a disk .",
    "turbulence dissipates into thermal motions of ions and electrons on the dynamical timescale , whereas ions and electrons exchange energy by slow coulomb collisions .",
    "the faster collective modes of ion - electron energy exchange may exist , though they may not lead to equilibration of temperatures @xcite .",
    "we do not separate the turbulent term or write an equation on it for the purpose of current work , as its direct dynamical influence is smaller than the influence of additional thermal energy produced via dissipation of turbulence and entropy production @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce the fractions @xmath53 and @xmath54 of changes of gravitational energy , which go directly into thermal energy of ions and electrons , but relate them via a direct heating mechanism @xcite . for the purpose of numerical stability",
    "we enhance coulomb collisions by a factor of @xmath55 which effectively makes ion and electron temperatures equal at large distances from the bh , but does not influence @xmath56 near the bh .",
    "let us convert the qualitative ideas into equations .",
    "the composition of plasma determines the exact balance of the black hole gravitational pull and supporting gas pressure .",
    "let us define the source function @xmath57 so that the ejected mass of stellar winds per second is @xmath58 we denote the electron density by @xmath52 and write the continuity equation as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the average atomic mass per one electron for assumed solar abundance of fully ionized elements @xcite .",
    "the ratio of number densities of atomic nuclei to electrons is @xmath61    we write separate energy equations for electrons ( e ) and all ions ( p ) in terms of @xmath62 assuming all ions have the same temperature .",
    "we set the speed of light equal unity @xmath63 and normalize to it all velocities .",
    "the ideal gas law gives normalized gas pressure @xmath64 to be substituted into the euler equation @xmath65 where @xmath66 the last term corresponds to zero bulk radial velocity of emitted stellar winds .",
    "the electron internal energy density can be approximated as @xmath67 this takes into account the differential heat capacity of particles @xcite .",
    "the ion internal energy per particle is @xmath68    the energy exchange rate by coulomb collisions is @xcite @xmath69 the non - relativistic formula is used everywhere , as @xmath70 rate is only significant in the region of non - relativistic electrons .",
    "the energy equation for electrons is then @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the enhancement of collisions and conductivity is given by equation ( [ conductivity ] ) .",
    "the left - hand side of the equation ( [ energy_electr ] ) represents the compressive heating in the adiabatic flow .",
    "the paczynski - wiita gravitational potential @xcite is implemented for gravitational force , but not in the entropy production term .",
    "this reflects the fact that the dissipation of turbulence ceases near the bh as having slower timescale compared to the inflow time .",
    "the energy equation for ions reads @xmath73 the energy injection rate into ions is chosen to be the same per electron as the energy injection rate into electrons to facilitate the equality of ion and electron temperatures .",
    "let us write a condition on @xmath53 and @xmath54 to decrease the number of free parameters .",
    "we assume the ratio of heating fractions to be given by the direct heating mechanism @xcite as @xmath74 despite this calculation is non - relativistic and a large fraction of energy dissipates at the small scales instead of direct large - scale heating .",
    "we solve the derived system of equations from the outer boundary of the feeding region at @xmath75 to the inner boundary at about @xmath76 thus covering @xmath77 orders of magnitude in radius .",
    "such a huge dynamic range requires the special solution technique , the solution of a time - dependent system of equations @xcite not being an option .",
    "we employ the shooting method and find the smooth transonic solution through the inner sonic point at @xmath78 in the presence of conduction the point , where sound speed equals inflow velocity is not special anymore , and instead the point , where isothermal speed equals the inflow velocity , plays the role of transonic surface @xcite .",
    "the system of equations is reduced to one temperature in the outflow by setting @xmath79 and adding the equations ( [ energy_electr ] ) and ( [ energy_prot ] ) .",
    "the inner boundary is set at a point @xmath80 , where @xmath81 in a non - conductive solution .",
    "then for any non - zero conductivity the zero heat flux condition @xmath81 is enforced at @xmath82 the outer boundary condition at @xmath83 is uncertain .",
    "it is natural to think the outflow would be transonic @xcite , however , significant outer pressure may hold the gas in the subsonic regime near @xmath84 the position of zero velocity stagnation point @xmath85 determines the accretion rate @xmath86 instead of setting the pressure at the outer boundary we regulate that pressure by setting temperature @xmath87 at the stagnation point .",
    "thus , we have 4 independent variables in the fit : accretion rate @xmath88 temperature at stagnation point @xmath89 the ion heating rate @xmath53 and the normalization @xmath90 of the point source contribution . they are all found iteratively to minimize @xmath91 we also iteratively find the positions of sonic point and stagnation point .",
    "the positions of inner boundary and outer boundary are unchanged while solving the 4-point boundary value problem .",
    "the observed surface brightness radial profile is the data we fit .",
    "we generate a surface brightness profile corresponding to the dynamical model by performing the optically thin ray tracing of x - rays at a set of photon energies and projected distances from the bh .",
    "we employ the up - to - date bremsstrahlung emissivities ( @xcite and errata ) and account for the emission by heavy elements , excluding iron .",
    "solar metallicity interstellar absorption @xcite is assumed with hydrogen column @xmath92@xmath93 the fluxes are convolved with the response of chandra to find counts , then blurred with the energy - independent psf ( see figure  [ fig_model ] ) and integrated over the radial extent of each bin .",
    "the model with @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96  k and @xmath97 produced at @xmath98 by a point source gives an excellent fit with the minimum reduced @xmath99 and weighed @xmath100 with @xmath101 weights .",
    "the stagnation point is at @xmath102 the correspondent unabsorbed point source luminosity @xmath103 is estimated for monoenergetic photons at @xmath15  kev and agrees with the estimates of ssc luminosity in @xcite .",
    "energy @xmath15",
    "kev is chosen as the energy chandra is most sensitive to for assumed @xmath104 the minimum reduced @xmath105 is achieved for the model without the point source .",
    "the models with the outer sonic point instead of finite bounding pressure underpredict the x - ray surface brightness at several arcseconds , assuming fixed @xmath92@xmath93 the reliable fitting for @xmath106 is possible only with the use of spectral data and is left for future research .",
    "the assumption @xmath107 represents the additional point of concern .",
    "temperature equilibrium might not hold at the stagnation point at @xmath9 @xcite , however the thermalization rate exceeds the outflow rate at @xmath20 in our subsonic dense outflow , thus @xmath107 holds there .",
    "the reliable modeling of non - equilibrium flows requires the modeling of the whole spatial structure of the stellar winds and is left for the future research as well .",
    "the profiles of electron density @xmath108 and temperature @xmath56 within several arcseconds from the bh are shown on figure  [ fig_arcprof ] and compare well with the simple earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "the difference is that our best fit is a subsonic flow supported by the outer medium with the density bounce at @xmath25 though the achieved outflow velocity @xmath109 is almost independent of radius for @xmath110 the line cooling @xcite reduces the heat contents only by several percent for gas reaching @xmath23 bremsstrahlung cooling being less important .",
    "the profiles of dimensionless electron temperature @xmath111 and ratio @xmath112 within several schwarzschild radii from the bh are shown on figure  [ fig_rgprof ] .",
    "the electron temperature @xmath113  k and density @xmath114 are found close to the bh .",
    "this dynamical model gives an excellent fit to the optically thick luminosity @xmath115  jy at @xmath3  ghz @xcite for assumed equipartition of thermal energy with the magnetic field .",
    "the model overpredicts by a factor of @xmath116 the observed faraday rotation measure @xmath117 at @xmath118  ghz @xcite , but this may well be a geometric factor .",
    "the accretion rate , temperature and density near the bh are in good agreement with more complicated models specifically focusing on sub - mm emission @xcite .",
    "we notice that the ratio of ion and electron temperatures @xmath112 is significantly larger than predicted by @xcite , but probably because of the significantly lower @xmath119 in their numerical simulations of the limited domain .",
