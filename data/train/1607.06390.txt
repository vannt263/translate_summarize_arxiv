    "searches for the annihilation products of dark matter ( dm ) are now testing significant portions of the theoretically motivated parameter space for weakly interacting massive particles .",
    "the rapid progress of indirect dm searches can be attributed to a large number of astrophysical probes that have become available over the last decade ( reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among these ,",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) on board _ fermi _ has played a vital role due to its full - sky coverage , sensitivity , and energy range relevant for dm searches at the electroweak scale .",
    "lat data have been used for numerous dm searches involving a variety of astrophysical objects , including dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies ( dsphs ) of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "dsphs are especially promising targets for indirect dm searches due to their ( 1 ) substantial dm content ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and proximity , ( 2 ) distribution over a range of galactic latitudes , including regions with low diffuse foreground emission , and ( 3 ) dearth of non - thermal production mechanisms .",
    "no @xmath0-raysignal has been conclusively associated with dsphs , either individually or as a population , and the corresponding upper limits have been used to set competitive constraints on dm annihilation ( summarized by * ? ? ?",
    "for example , a joint analysis of 15 dsphs with 6 years of lat data excluded dm particles annihilating at the canonical thermal relic cross section in some annihilation channels for dm masses up to 100 gev @xcite .",
    "although the non - dm @xmath0-rayemission from dsphs is expected to be low , no empirical measurement and few quantitative estimates for this contribution have been previously available .",
    "dsphs have old stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and low gas content @xcite , and therefore contain few sites for non - thermal radiation from cosmic - ray ( cr ) interactions .",
    "however , their ancient stellar populations might include small populations of @xmath0-ray - emitting millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , which have characteristic ages of several gyr based upon their measured spin periods and period derivatives ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "msps are luminous sources that account for nearly half of lat - detected pulsars . in addition , 25 mw globular clusters , which have similar - age stellar populations to dsphs , have been detected by the collective emission of their msp populations @xcite .",
    "msps exhibit hard spectral indices @xmath9 and spectral cut - offs around 3  gev @xcite . as a consequence , their intensity peaks in the gev range , where the lat sensitivity is highest .",
    "the characteristic spectral shape of msps is also similar to that of the galactic center excess , and many authors have investigated the contribution of msps to that signal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this letter , we estimate the conventional astrophysical emission intrinsic to dsphs , focusing on msps , and evaluate the potential for confusion with dm annihilation signatures at gev energies .",
    "msps are neutron stars that have been spun up to millisecond spin periods via mass accretion from a binary companion @xcite .",
    "different msp formation mechanisms are thought to dominate in various stellar environments .",
    "the classic `` primordial '' channel begins with a close stellar binary born from a single gas cloud with an extreme mass ratio between the two stars .",
    "these binary systems remain bound after the supernova explosion of the more massive star . in a later phase , during mass transfer from the companion star to the neutron star ,",
    "the binary becomes visible as a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) , and eventually as a msp accompanied by a low - mass white dwarf @xcite .",
    "for dense systems with high stellar encounter rates , the msp formation rate is increased by an additional mechanism : the gravitational capture of neutron stars into binary systems @xcite .",
    "this `` dynamical '' channel is expected to dominate in globular clusters @xcite .    in galactic disks ,",
    "the number of lmxbs scales linearly with stellar mass of the host galaxy @xcite , suggesting that primordial formation is dominant .",
    "dsphs also have low - density stellar environments , and therefore , it is likely that most lmxbs in dsphs have a primordial origin . while any direct comparison between the number of lmxbs and msps is uncertain , due to the different lifetimes of these two evolutionary stages",
    ", it is reasonable to expect the population of field msps to scale with stellar mass of the host galaxy if it does so for the progenitor systems .",
    "@xcite detected five lmxbs in a deep _ chandra _ survey of the sculptor dsph , implying that msps may also be present .",
    "no pulsars have been found yet in ursa minor , draco , or leo  i with searches at 350  mhz using the green bank radio telescope @xcite",
    ".    our strategy to evaluate the detectability of msps in dsphs will be the following .",
    "first , we construct the @xmath0-rayluminosity function ( lf ) of msps in the mw disk .",
    "second , we scale this lf from the stellar mass of the mw to the stellar masses of dsphs and compute the cumulative emission of the msp population .    in this work , we assume that msps formed in dsphs do not escape .",
    "neutron stars receive a `` kick '' in the supernova events in which they originate , estimated to be in the velocity range 1050 km s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "if unbound , msps would leave these systems in @xmath10 yr , i.e. , much shorter than the typical stellar ages of dsphs .",
    "these kick - velocity estimates are higher than the typical stellar velocity dispersion of dsphs , @xmath11 km s@xmath5 in dsphs @xcite",
    ". however , enclosed masses of classical dwarfs within 600 pc from the center are ( 27)@xmath12 m@xmath13 @xcite , corresponding to an escape velocity @xmath14 km s@xmath15 .",
    "this suggests that a fraction of msps should be retained within the virial radii of dsphs , which are assumed to be at kpc distances with a contained mass of @xmath16 m@xmath13 ( see also the calculations of * ? ? ?",
    "an msp orbiting at 600  pc from the center of a dsph located 80 kpc away would span an apparent @xmath17 angular size , which is within the 95% confinement radius of the lat ` pass8 front ` events at 2  gev .",
    "neutron star production might be enhanced in low metallicity systems relative to the galactic field by @xmath18% @xcite , though we do not include such corrections in our baseline calculations .",
    "our pulsar sample consists primarily of msps in the second lat pulsar catalog ( 2pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although all lat - detected msps were considered .",
    "] pulsars residing within globular clusters , as well as those lacking distance measurements , were both excluded , leaving 67 msps in our sample .",
    "the luminosities of galactic msps often have large uncertainties because accurate distance measurement is difficult .",
    "distance measurements based on dispersion measure suggest that for roughly 75% of the directions in the sky the accuracy is no better than a factor of 1.5 to 2 @xcite .",
    "we compare luminosities calculated with distances from 2pc and from the australian telescope national facility pulsar catalog ( atnf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in figure [ fig : complete ] .      as a first step towards constructing the galactic msp",
    "lf we perform a monte carlo ( mc ) incompleteness correction and apply it to our msp sample . in our model , we assume an exponential spatial distribution for msps in the mw disk : @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the radial distance from the galactic center and @xmath21 is the vertical scale height above the galactic plane . while other authors model the radial distribution of galactic msps using a gaussian density profile @xcite , @xcite find that their results are fairly insensitive to the selected radial law .",
    "we make no attempt to model a special population of msps in the galactic bulge ; our population of interest is field msps .    to account for systematic uncertainties both in the spatial distribution of galactic msps , as well as the effective selection function of the lat pulsar survey , we repeat the following mc procedure many times with different input parameter sets .",
    "first , following the msp population model of @xcite , we draw radial and vertical scale lengths from log - normal distributions defined by @xmath22  kpc and @xmath23  kpc , respectively ( see their table  3 ) . using these scale lengths ,",
    "we generate @xmath24 msps at random locations consistent with the spatial distribution of equation [ eqn : mw_dist ] and assuming azimuthal symmetry in galactocentric coordinates .",
    "we then determine the apparent galactic coordinates @xmath25 of each msp as viewed from the sun s position at @xmath26 .",
    "each msp @xmath27 coordinate is mapped to an effective flux detection threshold using the sensitivity curve in figure  17 of 2pc @xcite , which is expressed as a function of galactic latitude .",
    "this direction - dependent flux threshold partially accounts for variations in the intensity of diffuse galactic emission .",
    "we model systematic uncertainty in the 2pc selection function by drawing a direction - dependent flux threshold curve between the 10% and 90% percentile sensitivity range for each realization of the msp population ( sampled from a uniform distribution ) .",
    "the survey completeness is evaluated as the number of detectable msps at a given luminosity divided by the total number of simulated msps .    after calculating the detection efficiency for @xmath28 sets of spatial parameters and flux detection thresholds ,",
    "we arrive at the completeness function shown in figure [ fig : complete ] .",
    "we derive the msp @xmath0-raylf using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) assuming a broken power law parametrization . during the fit ,",
    "the median incompleteness correction ( section  [ sec : completeness ] ) is applied to the msps in each luminosity bin of our sample . after determining the lf posterior ,",
    "we normalize to unit stellar mass , assuming a mw stellar mass of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the resultant lf is shown in figure [ fig : l2dndl ] .    to estimate the systematic uncertainty ,",
    "we re - fit the lf pairing luminosities calculated from 2pc and atnf distances with the upper and lower limits of the incompleteness correction .",
    "these four bracketing cases establish the upper and lower systematic envelope on the lf . at high luminosity , uncertainty on the lf is driven by the small number of extremely luminous galactic msps , since the lat census of such sources is expected to be largely complete .",
    "systematic uncertainty dominates at low luminosity , due in part to the large and imperfectly known incompleteness correction that must be applied .",
    "our model predicts that the main contribution comes from msps with luminosities @xmath30 .",
    "both our incompleteness correction and lf are in reasonable agreement with @xcite ; their best - fit lf for field msps peaks around @xmath31 in @xmath32 .",
    "our target sample , summarized in table  [ tbl : dsph_flux ] , includes both spectroscopically confirmed dsphs and recently reported dsph candidates , which we collectively refer to as  dsphs \" for simplicity .",
    "since our model requires the stellar mass of the host galaxy as an input , we include only targets with published stellar masses .",
    "for each of the 30 dsphs in our sample , we scale the lf of galactic msps ( section  [ sec : lumfunction ] ) to the dsph stellar mass .",
    "the expectation value for the cumulative msp luminosity is found by integrating the lf , @xmath33 :    @xmath34    dsphs have small enough stellar populations that the number of luminous msps in a particular dsph may be subject to non - negligible `` shot noise '' . to model this effect , we evaluate the cumulative msp flux including poisson fluctuations in the number of msps within multiple luminosity intervals .",
    "we repeat this process @xmath35 times for each dsph to construct a pdf of the expected flux .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : pois ] , the spread in cumulative msp flux for a low stellar mass dsph , such as segue 1 , spans several order of magnitude , whereas high stellar mass dsphs , such as fornax and sculptor , have sharply peaked flux pdfs .",
    "the cumulative msp flux in an ultra - faint dsph is likely dominated by a handful of luminous sources , but the relative impact of such statistical variations diminishes with increasing stellar mass .      for each of the 30 dsphs in our sample , we compute the expectation value and uncertainty on the cumulative msp flux by adding in quadrature    1 .   statistical uncertainty due to the finite number of lat - detected galactic msps , 2 .   systematic uncertainty in the luminosities of galactic msps due to distance uncertainties , 3 .   systematic uncertainty in the detection efficiency of galactic msps due to their unknown spatial distribution and the effective flux threshold of the lat pulsar catalog , 4 .",
    "`` shot noise '' due to poisson fluctuations in the number of luminous msps , and 5 .",
    "uncertainty in the stellar mass of the host dsph .",
    "the results of these calculations , summarized in table  [ tbl : dsph_flux ] , suggest that high stellar mass dsphs are likely to host modest msp populations",
    ". however , even for the largest classical dsph , fornax , the predicted msp flux @xmath36  mev is @xmath37  ph  @xmath4  s@xmath5 , which is about an order of magnitude below the typical flux upper limits obtained at high galactic latitudes after six years of the lat survey , @xmath38 ph @xmath4 s@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "perhaps more importantly , draco and ursa minor , two classical dsphs with large and well constrained j - factors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have estimated msp fluxes another order of magnitude fainter than fornax .",
    "the msp emission of ultra - faint dsphs , such as segue 1 , is typically below @xmath39  ph  @xmath4  s@xmath5 and likely beyond the reach of @xmath0-raytelescopes in the foreseeable future .    to more easily compare @xmath0-raysignals from msps and dm annihilation , in figure  [ fig : sum_fig ] we show the expected msp flux versus j - factor for the host dsph .",
    "the potential for confusion is greatest between models with similar @xmath0-rayspectra , so we consider a dm model that produces a @xmath0-rayenergy flux peaking at @xmath40  gev , namely @xmath41 with a dm particle mass of 25 gev .",
    "this dm model is also compatible with dm interpretations of the galactic center excess ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to being below the current lat sensitivity threshold , we predict that msp emission in each of the dsphs is also below the annihilation signal expected from this dm model for an annihilation cross section at the thermal relic value @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sum_fig ] also demonstrates that the gev emission from msps and from dm annihilation follow different scaling relations across the dsph population .",
    "the targets with the largest j - factors are mainly nearby ultra - faint dsphs with @xmath43 , whereas we argue that dsphs with @xmath44 are most likely to host detectable @xmath0-raymsp populations .",
    "this distinction offers another means to distinguish a putative dm signal from conventional astrophysical sources .",
    "finally , two dsphs host their own globular clusters : five in fornax and one in eridanus  ii @xcite .",
    "the abundance of msps might be enhanced in such systems due to more frequent stellar encounters .",
    "the non - thermal emission in dsphs related to cr interactions is highly uncertain due to our present lack of knowledge regarding the acceleration and confinement of crs in such environments .",
    "still , it is possible to obtain an estimate using the quasi - linear scaling relation between @xmath0-rayluminosity and tracers of the star formation rate ( sfr ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering the most massive dsph , fornax , and using the smc as the nearest point of comparison with @xmath45  erg  s@xmath5 and @xmath46  m@xmath13  yr@xmath5 @xcite , the predicted luminosity of fornax is @xmath47  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "this estimate is comparable to the expected msp luminosity , but should be regarded as an upper limit considering the low gas content of dsphs ( @xmath48 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared to the smc ( @xmath49 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the interval between cr acceleration events in dsphs might be comparable to the cr confinement time , in which case the cr population may not reach an equilibrium state . following @xcite ,",
    "the rates of core - collapse and type ia supernovae for a galaxy with a constant sfr are @xmath50  yr@xmath5 and @xmath51  yr@xmath5  m@xmath52 , respectively . applying these rates to fornax ( @xmath53  m@xmath13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the expected supernova rate is @xmath40  myr@xmath5 . by comparison",
    ", the cr confinement time in the ( much larger ) mw at gev energies is @xmath54  yr .",
    "@xcite proposed that afterglows from tidal disruption events might also enhance @xmath0-rayemission in dsphs , although the duty cycle of such events is likely to be low .",
    "dsphs have commonly been regarded as astrophysically `` clean '' targets for which the detection of excess @xmath0 rayswould constitute compelling evidence for particle dm . however , conventional astrophysical emission must be present at some level , and in this letter we predict the contribution from msps . under the assumption that msps in both the mw disk and in dsphs originate mainly from primordial binary systems ( in contrast with globular clusters ) , we scale the lf of galactic msps to the stellar masses of dsphs to quantify their msp populations .",
    "we estimate that msp emission in the highest stellar mass dsphs , fornax and sculptor , is a factor @xmath6 below the current lat sensitivity threshold ( figure  [ fig : sum_fig ] ) . the msp emission in ultra - faint dsphs ( including targets with the largest j - factors ) is several orders of magnitude lower .",
    "moreover , for a dm particle of mass 25  gev annihilating to @xmath7 quarks at the thermal relic cross section ( consistent with dm interpretations of the galactic center excess ) , the expected @xmath0-rayemission due to dm exceeds that of the msp population in all of the dsphs considered here .    the lat sensitivity to dm annihilation in dsphs",
    "is anticipated to improve by nearly an order of magnitude over the coming decade due to increasing lat exposure , more precise j - factor measurements from deep spectroscopy , and additional dsph targets discovered in optical surveys such as lsst @xcite .",
    "these forecasts are based on a combined likelihood analysis weighting dsphs by their j - factors , as appropriate for dm searches .",
    "since we do not expect that many nearby and high stellar mass dsphs remain to be discovered , the sensitivity to the msp contribution may not improve as quickly as for dm signals .",
