    "recently , by studying the scalar - tensor gravity , davidson and gurwich davidson1 found an interesting metric , for which the exterior schwarzschild solution of gr is spontaneously induced by a phase transition which occurs precisely at the would - have - been event horizon ( see earlier discussion on the horizon phase transition @xcite ) , and the interior core is characterized by some nontrivial features .",
    "for instance , the core has a vanishing spatial volume .",
    "this provides a simple but direct explanation of the well - known problem : why the bh entropy is not proportional to the volume of the system as usual .",
    "note that the volume of normal bh can not be well - defined @xcite , partially because the r@xmath0 t signature flip , but in the current situation , it makes better since no such flip .",
    "moreover , compared with the schwarzschild bh , the komar mass @xcite within the core is well defined ( non - singular and positive ) . then the smarr formula @xcite can be extended to any inner sphere on which the area - entropy relation is extracted .",
    "it was argued that this provides a local realization of maximal entropy packing and a new way of nature s ultimate information storage . in ref .",
    "@xcite , davidson further designed a discrete holographic shell model to capture the holographic entropy packing inside bhs .",
    "it is interesting to see that even the logarithmic correction can be recovered .",
    "the davidson - gurwich ( dg ) horizon phase transition has been also found in the case with the reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) exterior @xcite . a natural problem is whether the phase transition can exist for a more general exterior .",
    "respecting the celebrated holographic correspondence between the supergravity in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space and conformal field theory ( cft ) on the boundary @xcite , one would most like to ask whether the locally holographic entropy packing can be present inside schwarzschild - ads bhs .",
    "moreover , one may also concern about the realization of the dg horizon phase transition in the asymptotically ds exterior , since the accelerated expansion of present universe could be derived by the positive cosmological constant and the earlier universe is well represented by ds - like exponentially inflationary phase .    in this paper , by choosing a special scalar potential",
    ", we will demonstrate the dg horizon phase transition with the schwarzschild - ds / ads exterior by numerical methods . with the mind that the ads / cft correspondence usually focuses on the cft in the flat spacetime , we will consider the spacetime with any sectional curvature .",
    "furthermore , we will derive a general form of the core metric by a new ( semi-)analytic method and check the nontrivial features .    on the other hand , in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that the dg phase transition can also be found in a simple theory of @xmath1 gravity with the square curvature correction .",
    "however , we will show that there is a subtle problem in the suggestion , that is , a precondition to the equivalence between the scalar - tensor gravity and @xmath1 gravity is not satisfied directly for the core metric .",

    "it this section , we will solve the master equations by a new analytic method .",
    "one can find that it is consistent with the numerical results and it is convenient to be used to check the nontrivial features of core in the next section .      by numerical inspection , we have shown that @xmath55 is negligible inside the would - have - been horizon ( see the first feature that we have stressed in above section ) .",
    "this suggests us to simplify the master equations by imposing @xmath65 inside the core . with this in mind",
    ", the master equations can be translated into@xmath66the analytic solution can be obtained as follows@xmath67where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the constants of integration .",
    "the scalar @xmath72 can be interpreted as the radius of the core because the core metric ( [ stcs ] ) can be self - consistent with the condition @xmath65 for all @xmath73 , if one imposes @xmath74 . however , the scale @xmath72 is fictitious at this stage since it can be absorbed into the coefficients @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the arbitrariness will be removed while we match the core metric with the exterior solution .",
    "the form of core metric ( [ stcs ] ) with @xmath44 has been obtained for the matter being vacuum @xcite or electromagnetic field davidson4 . here we have shown that the core metric can be derived with any @xmath57 and without invoking the concrete scalar potential .",
    "moreover , we note that eq .",
    "( [ stcs ] ) also can be derived using the equation ( [ vpp ] ) and the field equations with general matter content , provided that the matter satisfies @xmath75 inside the core .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analytic method was proposed to fix the integration constants .",
    "this method solves field equations near the region of phase transition then matches the result to the core and the rn exterior , respectively .",
    "however , it seems difficult to extend the analytic method to more general exterior . on the other hand",
    ", we note that there is a more simple analytic method to solve differential equations , which directly matches two approximate solutions near two boundaries .",
    "recently , this analytic method was introduced to understand the holographic superconductor @xcite . for the case of @xmath76 dimensional spacetimes",
    ", the analytic method can explain the qualitative features of superconductors and gives fairly good agreement with numerical results .",
    "a natural idea is to use this method to connect the core with the general exterior . before doing that",
    ", we would like to introduce a problem about the selection of the matching point . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the matching point is selected as the intermediate value @xmath77 between the range ( @xmath78 ) , but in fact , it could be rather arbitrary without changing the qualitative features . for the case of @xmath79 , it was found  @xcite that the matching point should be chosen in an appropriate range ( @xmath80 ) , otherwise the behavior of holographic superconductor can not be imitated qualitatively . in our understanding , this means that the behavior of the exact solution is not smooth enough to be simulated by the direct matching in the whole range . hence , one can suspect that for some differential equations which have very sharp peaks , the appropriate range of matching points is very small , and even no appropriate matching point can be found . in the following , one can find that we are just encountering both cases .",
    "fortunately , we still can obtain correct results by a reasonable assumption .    at first , let us consider the matching of core metric @xmath56 and the general gr solution @xmath27 . for convention , we will change the variable @xmath19 to @xmath81 , thus @xmath82 means the would - have - been horizon .",
    "the smooth matching usually requires two functions at two boundaries and their derivatives can be connected at one point:@xmath83 \\right\\vert _ { z_{m}}=\\left .",

    "this further means that the matching point is restricted at a very small range of @xmath90 .",

    "we require the core metric and exterior solution can be connected at certain point , which leads to@xmath96naively , one might also require their derivatives connecting , which means@xmath97 \\right\\vert _ { z_{m}}=\\left .",

    "( [ ae2 ] ) , one can find that @xmath100 should be positive and the matching point should be located at @xmath101 . however , this result is conflicted with all the numerical solutions that we have known . analyzing the analytic core metric ( [ stcs ] ) and schwarzschild exterior for instance",
    ", one can find that eq .",
    "( [ bg1 ] ) can be easily satisfied but eq .",
    "( [ bg2 ] ) can not hold outside the horizon .",
    "this phenomenon is more clear if one considers the direct matching between @xmath102 and the gr exterior @xmath103 , since the derivative of @xmath104 can not be vanishing unless @xmath105 . for fixing two integration constants @xmath69 and @xmath106 , we would like to give up the smooth matching but expect to replace eq .",
    "( [ bg2 ] ) with another new condition . here",
    "we propose that @xmath107 , @xmath56 and @xmath4 can be matched at the same position .",
    "this is a natural ansatz since it implies that we are considering the phase transition which happens at the same position ( see the third feature that we have stressed in above section ) .",

    "( [ zmh ] ) , we have@xmath108similarly , in terms of eq . ( [ zmh ] )",
    "and@xmath109we can fix the integration constant as @xmath110 .",
    "several remarks are in order .",
    "firstly , we stress that eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) and @xmath110 can be viable to a general exterior .",
    "the information of general exterior manifests in @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "thus , in the next section , we can study the features of the core connecting a general exterior , while not restricted in a concrete bh .",
    "secondly , the explicit expressions of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 demonstrate that @xmath72 is the horizon radius indeed .",
    "thirdly , we can recover the results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite for the schwarzschild or rn exterior , up to a factor of the number @xmath94 .",
    "interestingly , the number @xmath94 will not affect any properties of the core , as we will show in next section .",
    "fourthly , in the above , we treat three functions ( @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath4 ) as independent functions .",
    "in fact , with the mind that there are only four constants of integration @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath113 and @xmath71 , one can not impose three functions and their derivatives connecting at the same time in general . to obtain the desired nontrivial core , one can select four conditions as we have done , namely , eqs . ( [ ae1 ] ) , ( [ ae2 ] ) , ( [ bg1 ] ) , and ( [ g2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we still have treated these functions as independent ones , because it suggests a simple but robust analytic method , which could be applicable to the case where the undetermined functions of some differential equations have enough constants of integration and the exact solutions do not satisfy all the conditions of the direct smooth matching .",
    "the key point is to find the reasonable alternative conditions .    at last ,",
    "we write the general form of the core metric for any exterior solution@xmath114where we have recovered @xmath72 explicitly for later convention .",
    "in this section , we will check whether the different exterior , namely , the factors @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and the number @xmath94 that characterizes our analytic method , will affect the nontrivial features of the core given in @xcite . before doing that , it should be noted that the approach to the nontrivial features requires a static spacetime .",
    "for instance , the killing vector will be involved , which is not well defined in a dynamic spacetime .",
    "so we will take into account the core with a general static exterior , which excludes the case of schwarzschild - ds exterior .",
    "associated with any surface @xmath9 of radius @xmath19 , the spatial volume is@xmath117where we have used @xmath9 to express the unit area of the surface @xmath118 . in contrast to the corresponding finite surface area @xmath119 , it is obvious that the spatial volume tends to vanish at the @xmath120 limit .",
    "the surface gravity of any surface inside the core can be calculated as@xmath121one can find that @xmath122 tends to be a constant from @xmath123 to the origin at @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , this constant is exactly identified as @xmath125 the hawking temperature of usual bhs .",
    "this suggests that the core is under thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the nontrivial feature of the core temperature can also be seen from the rindler structure of the core:@xmath126where the proper length coordinate is@xmath127thus , hawking s imaginary time periodicity can be recovered from eq .",
    "( rindler ) .",
    "but unlike in the original gr bh , the euclidean origin corresponds now to the center of @xmath124 rather than to @xmath123 . by calculating the curvature scalar at leading order , for instance",
    ", @xmath128one should be noted that the origin is always the singularity of the general metric can not be vanishing otherwise the core metric ( [ stlespec ] ) is divergent . ] .",
    "this problem was expected davidson1,davidson4 to be solved by involving a more complicated lagrangian or quantum effects .",
    "consider the komar mass @xcite@xmath129where @xmath130 is the killing vector and @xmath131 is a spatial volume with the boundary @xmath9 .",
    "one can prove that for any surface @xmath9 , it satisfies a geometric relation@xmath132which can be reduced to the smarr formula for usual bhs @xcite .",
    "the komar mass is meaningless in the interior of usual bhs , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 can be negative and even negative infinite davidson1,davidson4 .",
    "interestingly , however , @xmath134 of the core metric ( [ stlespec ] ) is finite and positive - definite as desired for the gravitational mass .",
    "one can see that the radial light rays obey the null geodesics@xmath135thus , for an observer at asymptotic distance , a light ray sent from some @xmath136 is very difficult to move even a small distance .",
    "in other words , it indicates that each layer of the core acts as an event horizon which freezes the light ray if one looks from the outside .",
    "it hence seems reasonable to associate the entropy on any inner surface to describe the lack of the information behind it .      with the mind",
    "that the surface gravity is constant inside the core , eq .",
    "( smarr ) suggests that every concentric inner surface of invariant surface area @xmath137 carries a geometric fraction @xmath138 of the total komar mass enclosed by the would - have - been outer horizon , which also hints the entropy packing inside the would - have - been horizon .",
    "furthermore , since the surface gravity can be exactly identified as @xmath125 the hawking temperature of usual bhs , one can rewrite the smarr formula ( [ smarr ] ) as@xmath139note that there does not exist an analogous formula for the interior of ordinary bhs .",
    "taking eq .",
    "( [ sttherformu ] ) as a significant thermodynamic equality , one could regard the expression in the parenthesis in eq .",
    "( sttherformu ) as the entropy stored within an arbitrary inner surface@xmath140interestingly , this is just the universal holographic entropy bound , and what is remarkable is that the bound is locally saturated .",
    "hereto , none of the features of the core which we have checked are influenced by the factors of the general exterior .",
    "moreover , all the features also have not been affected by the number @xmath94 appeared in the core metric ( [ stlespec ] ) , which supports the effectiveness of our analytic method .",
    "in general , the @xmath1 theory can be equivalent to the brans  dicke theory with the vanishing brans  dicke parameter , if the condition@xmath141is satisfied @xcite .",
    "therefore , in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that the dg horizon phase transition can also be found in a simple @xmath1 gravity with the square curvature correction@xmath142since eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) satisfy eq .",
    "( [ con ] ) . actually , the equation of motion of scalar field ( [ stseq ] ) can be expressed as@xmath143which is equivalent to the condition@xmath144    however , one should be careful that , according to the metric ansatz ( stgle ) , the field equations ( [ stfeqs ] ) ( then the master equations ) include three independent equations which are enough to determine three undetermined functions @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in general , the obtained solutions will not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) , which hence must be taken as an additional constraint . in the following ,",
    "we will show both analytically and numerically that the solution with the dg horizon phase transition does not satisfy eq .",

    "( [ condition ] ) .",
    "one can find that @xmath149 is not vanishing in general inside the core .",
    "in particular , it increases rapidly when the parameter @xmath28 declines .     for the core with schwarzschild exterior .",

    "we also find an analytic expression of the core connecting a general exterior .",
    "we have checked that the static analytic core has the nontrivial features , including the vanishing spatial volume , constant temperature , positive - definitive komar mass , the freezing light ray , and the locally holographic entropy packing .",
    "all these features are not changed by the factor of the general exterior .",
