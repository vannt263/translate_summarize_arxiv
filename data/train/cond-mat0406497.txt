    "the time - averaged orbiting potential ( top ) trap @xcite was an important tool in the realization of bose - einstein condensates , and it remains a common method for magnetically trapping atoms .",
    "early theoretical descriptions of the top trap used two approximations : the adiabatic approximation , which assumes that the magnetic dipoles of the atoms align instantaneously to the magnetic field , and the _ time - average approximation _ , where the time dynamics of the trapping fields are neglected on the time scale of the motion of the trapped atoms . under these assumptions ,",
    "the top trap is represented by a static , harmonic potential and the condensate eigenstates are relatively easily calculated ( usually by numerical means ) and are stationary in space .",
    "however , condensates formed in a top trap undergo a spatial micro - motion @xcite due to the underlying dynamic nature of the top trap . this phenomenon has been studied theoretically under various levels of approximation , by partially lifting the time - average approximation @xcite or by not applying the adiabatic approximation @xcite .    in this work we provide a detailed theoretical description of condensate micro - motion in terms of top trap eigenstates , including condensate nonlinearity .",
    "our approach applies the adiabatic approximation , but partially lifts the time - average approximation . under these conditions ,",
    "the top trap potential retains some time dependence and eigenstates of that potential can not be found in the lab frame .",
    "however , system eigenstates do exist because a frame can be found in which the hamiltonian for the system becomes time independent .",
    "we have termed eigenstates of the system found in such a frame _ dynamical eigenstates _ , since these states are not stationary states in the lab frame . by calculating the dynamical eigenstates of the top trap",
    ", full characterisation of condensate micro - motion is possible .",
    "this is essential for an understanding of condensate growth and is also required for a description of velocity sensitive phenomena occuring in top traps , such as observed in bragg scattering experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate dynamical eigenstates of the top trap potential in the _ quadratic average approximation_. within that approximation , the solutions are exact in both the linear _ and _ the nonlinear case .",
    "we begin , in section  [ sec : pot ] , by introducing the top trap potential , and various approximate forms of that potential . in section  [ sec : circ_trans_frame ] we derive the transformation to the _ circularly translating frame _ which we find to be the most natural frame in which to investigate the system . in section  [ sec : solitary ] we calculate solitary - wave solutions in the quadratic average approximation and show that dynamical eigenstates calculated using the circularly translating frame are a particular class of solitary - wave solutions in the lab frame . identifying the dynamical eigenstates of the top trap allows us to characterize micro - motion and specify the ground state of the system . in section  [ sec : pert ] , we assess the validity of the quadratic average approximation and demonstrate that for the typical parameter regime of the top trap , solitary - wave dynamical eigenstates provide accurate approximations to the dynamical eigenstates of the full top trap potential . in section  [ sec : rotating ] , we discuss lab frame solitary - wave solutions which are eigenstates of the top trap potential in the more commonly used rotating frame , and show that these are only a subset of the dynamical eigenstates found using the circularly translating frame .",

    "it is possible to solve for @xmath104 which has six constants of integration , given by the initial values of the centre of mass position and momentum of the particular solitary - wave solution ( see equation ( [ centre_mass_motion ] ) ) .",
    "the dynamical eigenstates calculated using the circularly translating frame , given by equation ( [ estates_ctf ] ) , are a particular class of solitary - wave solutions in the lab frame .",
    "this can be confirmed by transforming the solitary - wave solutions , as given by equation ( [ psi - postulate ] ) , into the circularly translating frame , and requiring that these solutions satisfy the time independent gross - pitaevskii equation in that frame , i.e. @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 in order to satisfy equation ( [ gross - pitaevskii equation_tind ] ) , the solitary - wave solutions of equation ( [ solution_ctframe ] ) have a restriction on @xmath104 , as derived in appendix [ appendix : ctf ] .",
    "solitary - wave solutions of the lab frame are eigenstates of the top trap in the circularly translating frame if and only if the initial conditions of the centre of mass motion of the solitary - wave solutions have particular values such that @xmath108 and therefore @xmath109 these equations represent circular motion at the top trap frequency @xmath110 , with radius @xmath111 . previously @xcite the micro - motion position amplitude has been determined to be @xmath112 , which is in agreement with our result ( see equation ( [ gamma ] ) ) in the limit @xmath113 .    with the centre of mass motion for solitary - wave dynamical eigenstates of the top trap given by equations ( [ meanx_col ] ) and ( [ meank_col ] ) , we find that @xmath114 and the phase @xmath91 becomes @xmath115 making these substitutions , equation ( [ solution_ctframe ] ) simplifies to equation ( [ estates_ctf ] ) so that all dynamical eigenstates of the top trap , calculated using the circularly translating frame , are a particular class of solitary - wave solutions in the lab frame with centre of mass motion given by equations ( [ meanx_col ] ) and ( [ meank_col ] ) .",
    "this shows that the origin of the circularly translating frame ( refer to equations ( [ circtrans ] ) and ( [ circtrans_p ] ) with @xmath116 ) moves with the centre of mass motion of the solitary - wave dynamical eigenstates of the top trap , therefore justifying our choice of the circularly translating frame for describing the top trap .",

    "the ground state of the top trap system is the solitary - wave dynamical eigenstate with the lowest chemical potential in the circularly translating frame .",
    "this occurs when @xmath121 the chemical potential of the envelope wave function , takes its lowest possible value ( see equation ( [ mu - ct ] ) ) . since , as noted in section  [ sec : qft ] , the uncondensed atoms experience the same potential as the condensate , in the circularly translating frame , these thermalize during evaporation into the usual bose - einstein distribution , and hence condensation from the vapour will be into the top trap ground state , as determined using the circularly translating frame .",
    "therefore , the state into which bosons condense , in the quadratic average approximation is the solitary - wave dynamical eigenstate given by equation ( [ solution_ctframe ] ) with the envelope wave function being the ground state of equation ( [ gross - pitaevskii equation - psi - h ] ) and @xmath104 given by equation ( [ meanx_col ] ) .",

    "thus , we expect that for the nonlinear case , the quadratic average approximation is also valid within the regime derived above for the linear case .",
    "we have carried out two dimensional numerial calculations for the nonlinear case which verify this .",
    "for example , for a typical top trap system where @xmath149 and @xmath150 we have propagated the gross - pitaevskii equation using both the truncated top trap potential of equation ( [ pot_exp_trunc-3d ] ) and the potential in the quadratic average approximation , given by equation ( [ approx - pot-3d ] ) . an appropriate value for the two dimensional nonlinear stregth is @xmath118 which correspondes to @xmath151x@xmath152 in the otago top trap @xcite .",
