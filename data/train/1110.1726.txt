    "neutron stars ( nss ) and black holes ( bhs ) are among the most exotic objects produced in nature .",
    "they are formed in the core collapse of massive stars and , in many cases , their formation is associated with powerful astrophysical transients such as supernovae and gamma - ray bursts . by studying the masses of these objects we can better understand their formation process and associated explosions .",
    "in addition , accurate measurements of masses of nss and bhs provide essential input to our understanding of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena produced by these objects , from gravitational waves formed in compact object mergers to x - ray bursts .    observations of binaries containing nss and bhs ( e.g. x - ray binaries , x - ray bursts , and binary pulsars ) place constraints on their mass distribution .",
    "estimates of the ns mass distribution have benefited from observations of close pulsar binary systems where extremely accurate masses can be obtained through pulsar timing .",
    "originally , analyses of these binaries suggested a very narrow mass distribution around 1.35m@xmath1 ( e.g. thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 ) .",
    "more recently , as available data have increased and become more refined , it has become clear that the mass distribution is at least bimodal , and likely has a wide spread ranging from low masses up to the maximum ns mass limit @xcite .",
    "the observation of a @xmath2m@xmath1 ns  @xcite is an indication of the width of the distribution .",
    "black - hole mass measurements rely on a complex combination of challenging observations of x - ray binaries ( in quiescence , if they are transient ) and of modeling of photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "the uncertainties associated with these measurements are more significant than in the case of nss .",
    "early analysis  @xcite argued that the measurements are consistent with a relatively narrow mass distribution  @xcite around 7m@xmath1 .",
    "recent analyses  @xcite have used the expanded current samples of black - hole measurements in both roche - lobe - overflow and wind - driven x - ray binaries and proposed distributions to fit the observations ( without quantitative consideration of selection effects ) .",
    "the statistically favored models have mass distributions that extend to high masses ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) , depending on whether the wind - fed systems with more massive bhs ( which are more uncertain ) are included .",
    "both studies conclude that there is clear evidence for a low - mass gap in the distribution , with no remnants found in between the maximum ns mass ( @xmath5 ) and 45@xmath6 .",
    "specifically ,  @xcite report that the minimum bh mass lies in the range 4.34.5@xmath7 at 90% confidence level .    by combining information from stellar evolution and core - collapse calculations ,",
    "theoretical investigations allow us to calculate the mass of compact remnants at formation .",
    "timmes et al.(1996 ) based their estimates on the iron core masses predicted from their stellar evolution models .",
    "these masses had a bimodal distribution , causing them to predict a bimodal distribution of remnant masses .",
    "although they mention that fallback would be expected to broaden the distribution , many observational analyses arguing for narrow distributions were nonetheless affected by their reported bimodality .",
    "two of the assumptions in timmes et al.(1996 ) lead to biases in their theoretical mass estimates of compact remnants .",
    "first , the sharp change in iron core masses is not as pronounced in more modern stellar models ( e.g. young et al .",
    "second , the final remnant mass is determined by the entropy profile ( and hence density / temperature profiles ) in the core .",
    "although the entropy in the core is roughly correlated with the iron core mass , there does not exist a one - to - one correspondence .",
    "using the iron core mass to estimate remnant masses can lead to erroneous results .",
    "fryer & kalogera ( 2001 ) estimated remnant masses using collapse calculations to guide the relation between initial stellar mass and final remnant mass .",
    "these estimates predicted a broader range of ns and bh masses : for nss , we found a strong , dominant peak at 1.31.4@xmath7 , with a significant tail out to the maximum neutron - star mass .",
    "this prediction has subsequently been borne out for nss .",
    "for bhs they found an extended , continuous exponential distribution without a mass gap .",
    "the mass gap could be introduced only if a discontinuity exists in the relationship between the supernova explosion energy and progenitor mass .",
    "the bulk of the analysis by fryer & kalogera ( 2001 ) focused on bhs from stars without mass loss . especially at higher metallicities ,",
    "the final bh mass distribution depends sensitively on the mass loss from stellar winds  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take advantage of new results in both stellar evolution and stellar explosions to produce more detailed estimates of compact remnant distributions .    to construct remnant mass distributions",
    ", we consider a wide range of explosion mechanisms based on our current understanding of supernova and gamma - ray burst explosions .",
    "for an initial explosion we adopt the convection - enhanced neutrino - driven paradigm , studying the range of results within this mechanism .",
    "specifically , we study two extremes : _ fast - convection _ explosions where explosions only occur if they happen in the first 250ms after bounce , and _ delayed - convection _ explosions which can occur over a much longer timescale ( e.g. , explosions dominated by the standing accretion shock instability , or sasi ) . in both cases , by assuming the energy input is limited to the convective region , this model places limits on the supernova explosion energy of up to a few times @xmath8erg .    on top of this basic mechanism , we discuss two post - explosion engines : magnetar or similar neutron - star driven outbursts and collapsar black hole engines . for example , a variant of the basic engine assumes that additional energy is released ( e.g. , from energy stored in the oscillating or rotating proto - nss ) after the launch of the convection - enhanced explosion .",
    "this variant will have minimal fallback , and can produce explosions well beyond the few times @xmath8erg limit for our basic model .",
    "finally , we expect that some bh forming systems will develop jets , producing long - duration grbs and ejecting stellar material , limiting the final mass of the bh . in what follows , we present compact mass distributions from our basic engines plus a number of post - explosion variants .",
    "in this paper we present a review of the basics of the supernova engine ( section  [ sec : supernovaengine ] ) , followed by a derivation and discussion of the energies produced by these engines ( section  [ sec : energy ] ) .",
    "we derive remnant masses for single stars as a function of progenitor mass , ranging from the lowest mass , electron capture supernovae , to massive stars ( section  [ sec : reminit ] ) . with this remnant mass relation",
    ", we derive remnant mass distributions for single stars ( section  [ sec : reminit ] ) .",
    "since the observed mass distribution is only observed in binary systems ( binary pulsars and x - ray binaries ) , we also derive fits to our mass derivation calculations appropriate for binary calculations ( section  [ sec : binary ] ) .",
    "we conclude by comparing our different models of remnant mass distributions with observations .",
    "to understand the remnant mass distribution we must first understand the physical scenarios behind their formation . and to understand the formation of remnants from stellar collapse , we must understand the explosions from stellar collapse .",
    "most current studies of core - collapse supernovae have focused on a neutrino - driven engine enhanced by convection above the proto - neutron star surface  @xcite .",
    "it was this type of physical engine that served as the basis for the mass distributions used already by @xcite .",
    "however , this basic supernova engine has been refined in the past decade , and it is important to incorporate these refinements into our remnant mass distribution .",
    "the remnant formation process can be split into 3 phases : stellar collapse and bounce , convective engine , and post - explosion fallback .",
    "the collapse occurs when the stellar core begins to compress under its own weight .",
    "the compression ultimately leads to electron capture ( which removes the degeneracy pressure support of the core ) and dissociation of the core elements into alpha particles ( which removes the thermal support ) .",
    "these processes accelerate the compression which then accelerates the rate of electron capture and iron dissociation , leading to a runaway collapse with velocities comparable to the speed of light .",
    "the collapse halts when the core reaches nuclear densities and nuclear forces ( along with neutron degeneracy pressure ) dramatically increase the pressure .",
    "this abrupt halt causes a bounce shock to move out of the core , starting at @xmath9m@xmath110 - 20% lower . ]",
    "the shock moves out until neutrino losses ( and dissociation of material hit by the shock ) sap its energy reservoir , causing it to stall ( at roughly @xmath10m@xmath1 ) .",
    "if the shock can be quickly revived ( likely for stars below 11m@xmath1 ) , then remnant masses would be close to @xmath10m@xmath1 .    for stars with initial masses above 11m@xmath1 , a number of instabilities can develop in the region between the proto - ns where the shock is launched and the position where it stalls : e.g. , the rayleigh - taylor and the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) .",
    "these instabilities can convert the energy leaking out of the proto - ns in the form of neutrinos to kinetic energy pushing the convective region outward .",
    "a supernova explosion occurs if the energy in this convective region can overcome the ram pressure of the infalling stellar material .",
    "this is what we mean by a `` convection - enhanced , neutrino - driven supernova explosion '' . in this paper",
    ", our basic model assumes that the energy in the supernova explosion is the energy stored in this convective region .",
    "the time when the energy in the convective region overcomes the ram pressure determines the amount of material accreted onto the proto - neutron star during the convective phase . the total energy in the convective region when this occurs determines the amount of energy in the explosion , and ultimately the amount of post - shock - launch fallback . as the material moves",
    "outward , it pushes onto the material above it and causes that material to accelerate .",
    "the work done by this shocked material slows it down , and some of the material is decelerated below the local escape velocity .",
    "this material will then fall back onto the proto - ns , adding to the remnant mass .",
    "in general , the majority of this fallback occurs within the first 20s after the explosion ( zhang et al .",
    "2008 , fryer 2009 ) .",
    "the mass amount ( and to some extent the timing ) of this fallback depends on the explosion energy and the structure of the star .",
    "it is this fallback that is the dominant cause for the broad range of ns and bh masses .",
    "determining the amount of fallback requires understanding the explosion itself .      to determine the energy of our convection - enhanced , neutrino - driven engines , we assume that the explosion energy is equal to the energy stored in the convective region at the time of collapse .",
    "fryer ( 2006 ) has already estimated this energy and we review this derivation here .",
    "colgate et al . (",
    "1993 ) found that they could approximate the convective region as a roughly constant entropy atmosphere bounded by the proto - ns and the shock region of the infalling stellar envelope .",
    "the structure of this atmosphere is then well defined , with the pressure given by : @xmath11 ^ 4 { \\rm erg \\ , cm^{-3}}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the proto - ns mass , @xmath13 is the gravitational constant , @xmath14 is the entropy in boltzmann s constant per nucleon , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the radius and pressure of the accretion shock forming the outer bound of the convective region .",
    "@xmath17 is set to the ram pressure of the infalling material .",
    "if we assume the infalling star is accreting at the free - fall rate , mass continuity gives ( fryer 2006 ) : @xmath18 where the free - fall velocity @xmath19 is determined by the proto - ns mass and the accretion rate @xmath20 is determined by the structure of the progenitor star assuming a pressure - less collapse ( which is a good approximation for the infall ) . for a radiation - dominated gas , the internal energy density is @xmath21 ( fryer 2006 ) : @xmath22 ^ 4 { \\rm erg \\ , cm^{-3}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating over the entire atmosphere , we can derive the maximum energy stored in the convective region .",
    "if the energy in the convective region is above this maximum value , the pressure in the atmosphere will be larger than the infall pressure , causing the shock radius to expand . by the time the shock expands to 1000 km , the expansion is really an explosion .",
    "after the explosion is launched , the atmosphere is too thin to absorb much neutrino energy .",
    "neutrinos leaking from the core can no longer add much energy to the now exploding atmosphere .",
    "the energy of the explosion from the neutrino - driven mechanism is then limited to roughly the energy when the explosion is launched .",
    "for a typical atmospheric entropy of @xmath23 and shock radius of 1000 km , energies above @xmath24erg only occur for accretion rates above 1@xmath25 .",
    "see fryer ( 2006 ) for a study of the dependence of the explosion energies on the atmosphere parameters .",
    "the energy that can be stored in the convective region decreases as the accretion rate decreases .",
    "the accretion rate of the infalling stellar material decreases with time , causing the total available explosion energy to decrease with time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snevst ] ) .",
    "if the delay in the explosion is long , the explosion will be weak .",
    "this model assumes the explosion energy is stored in the convective region and provides a natural explanation for why the observed explosion energy for most supernovae are found in the range @xmath26@xmath27 even though the potential energy released in stellar collapse is @xmath28erg .",
    "the peak energy stored in the convective region is roughly a few times @xmath8erg , and this engine can not produce a stronger explosion . if the explosion occurs less than 250ms after bounce , the energy is above @xmath8erg for most progenitors .",
    "most observed supernovae have explosion energies within these limits .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic engines produce a much broader range of supernova engines and are thus not the likely engines behind `` standard '' core - collapse supernovae .",
    "our basic models consider only the convection - enhanced neutrino - driven supernova engine , since this is able to account for the majority of supernovae . within this basic set",
    ", we still vary the length of the delay time prior to the explosion .",
    "one model allows for considerable contribution from the sasi engine , a current focus of many supernova groups ( blondin et al .",
    "2003 , burrows et al .",
    "2007 , bruenn et al .",
    "2009 , scheck et al .",
    "2008 , marek & janka 2009 ) .",
    "the sasi has a growth time that is typically over an order of magnitude longer than the rayleigh - taylor instabilities , and hence is unable to drive an explosion at early times . for our standard model ,",
    "we allow an explosion only after the accretion rate drops below 1@xmath29 . in this formalism , stars below about @xmath30 produce explosions enhanced by convection dominated by the rayleigh - taylor instability , whereas above this mass the explosions are enhanced by convection dominated by large - scale modes characterized by the sasi .",
    "for many progenitors , the latter occurs at later times .",
    "if the proto - ns exceeds 3@xmath31 , we assume the star collapses promptly to a bh ( a.k.a . the `` direct '' bh formation scenario from fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "our alternate convection - enhanced supernova engine model focuses on strong convective models developing rapidly and driving an explosion within the first 250ms ( e.g. , herant et al 1994 , fryer & warren 2002 ) . in this engine , we assume an explosion occurs when the accretion rate drops below 3@xmath32 .",
    "if the proto - ns exceeds 3@xmath31 or the delay time exceeds 250ms , we assume the star collapses to a bh .    figure  [ fig : snenergy ] shows the supernova explosion energies for these two models as a function of progenitor mass using the woosley et al.(2002 ) progenitors at solar and zero metallicity .",
    "the delayed explosions tend to be weaker than our rapid explosion model , producing many more explosions with energies below @xmath8erg .",
    "the explosion energies depend upon the prescriptions for mass loss ( or , more accurately , the coefficients used in the mass loss prescription ) and convection , and we discuss the differences in these models in section  [ sec : caveats ] . above @xmath33@xmath34 , the mass loss plays the deciding role in determining the remnant mass , as we discuss this in detail in section  [ sec:30msun ] .    after the initial launch of the convection - enhanced explosion ,",
    "the region above the proto - ns is evacuated . at this point ,",
    "the energy deposited by neutrinos in this region is drastically reduced . as we discuss below ( section  [ sec : energy ] ) , this places a limit on the explosion energy from the neutrino driven supernova engine    there exist other mechanisms to extract the enormous energy reserved in the collapsed stellar core .",
    "for example , if the stellar core is rotating rapidly , strong magnetic fields may develop .",
    "as the proto - ns contracts , an enormous amount of energy can be stored in the rotation , driving a second outburst from the ns .",
    "this energy source has been invoked to explain a variety of energetic supernova explosions ( e.g. maeda et al .",
    "2007 , kasen & bildsten 2010 ) .",
    "although quantitative calculations of rotation powered explosions do not exist , we can place an upper limit based on the predicted spin - energy in the ns ( @xmath35 erg for a millisecond ns ) .",
    "if such an explosion occurs , the fallback onto the proto - ns will be minimal . in our third",
    "( `` magnetar '' ) model for remnant distributions , we assume this additional explosive engine occurs in all systems .",
    "we note that fallback can also cause a secondary outburst as the material accretes onto the protons  @xcite .",
    "this is less explosive than a magnetar and , to show the extremes , we focus only on the magnetar explosion .",
    "the collapsar engine behind hypernovae posits that a rapidly spinning star collapses down to a bh .",
    "the jet produced by the accretion disk that forms around the bh `` drills '' through the stellar envelope and ultimately ejects the star , preventing further accretion ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) . in our final scenario ( collapsar ) , we include the mass loss from this powerful engine .",
    "there exist many permutations of our basic convection engines combined with post - explosion engines ( e.g. collapsar , magnetar ) .",
    "however , it is anticipated that just a small fraction of systems are affected by the post - explosion engines . to encapsulate the effect of the post - explosion models on the final mass distributions , we assume ( an unreasonably high ) 100% efficiency in these engines , and study only the four cases described shown in table  [ table : engines ] .",

    "we are interested in determining the masses of the compact remnants ( ns and bh ) .",
    "doing this requires a combined understanding of stellar structure , the supernova engine , and the propagation of the explosion through the star ( along with the fallback material ) .",
    "these are all very active areas of research , and in this section we use the current understanding of these physical processes to derive remnant mass distributions .",
    "the physics determining the remnant masses can be divided into three zero - age main sequence ( zams ) progenitor mass ranges : stars below 11m@xmath1 , stars between 11 and @xmath3630m@xmath1 , and star more massive than @xmath3630@xmath3735 m@xmath1 . for the low mass stars , the primary uncertainty in the remnant mass arises from uncertainties in stellar convection . for the intermediate masses ,",
    "our understanding , or lack thereof , of the supernova explosion mechanism dominates the uncertainties . for the massive stars the primary uncertainty is in the prescription for mass loss ( for details ,",
    "see section  [ sec : caveats ] ) . to derive remnant masses",
    "we are forced to make a range of assumptions ( described in detail below ) .",
    "we note that understanding the nature of these uncertainties is a critical component in using observational masses to constrain theory .      for zams progenitor stars below @xmath3611m@xmath1 ,",
    "the fate of collapse is the same for all of our explosion models .",
    "the fallback in the supernova explosion from these progenitors is negligible .",
    "as such , the uncertainties in the shock propagation are minimal . in addition , as we shall see below , the uncertainties in the explosion mechanism only alter the final remnant mass by , at most , 0.1m@xmath1 .",
    "the primary uncertainty in the remnant mass distribution from these stars arises from determining the number of these objects which , in turn , is caused by uncertainties in stellar evolution . in particular , stellar evolution models do not accurately constrain the transition mass between white dwarf and ns formation ( i.e. , the lower mass limit for ns formation ) .",
    "the exact value of the lower limit ( @xmath38 ) for core - collapse has been a matter of debate for many decades ( see iben & renzini 1983 for a review ) .",
    "the metallicity dependence for this limit is even more controversial .",

    "electron - capture supernovae occur in one cores when electron capture triggers a core - collapse prior to neon ignition .",
    "the electron capture supernova and remnant are similar to those in the low - mass iron core - collapse supernova produced by progenitors below 11m@xmath1 . as such , for the purpose of our remnant calculation we will lump this class of supernova with all other supernovae below 11m@xmath1 . ] their `` preferred '' model predicts that @xmath38 drops from 9m@xmath1 at solar metallicity down to below 6.3m@xmath1 at @xmath39 .",

    "( 2008 ) found that this result was highly sensitive to their prescriptions for mass loss and dredge up . in some of their models , the variation with respect to metallicity less than 1m@xmath1 in contrast to the 2.7m@xmath1 assumed in this model .",
    "understanding stellar evolution will allow us to determine how many nss are formed from stars with initial masses below 11m@xmath1 .",
    "however , the mass of the remnant that is formed in the collapse of these stars is determined by the supernova engine . for these low mass stars (",
    "both electron capture / one supernovae and iron collapse supernovae ) the envelope of the star is fairly tenuous ( and relatively easily ejected ) , and the collapsing core is close to the chandrasekhar limit : @xmath41m@xmath1 for omgne stars .",

    "we expect the remnant mass to be relatively flat for all stars below 11m@xmath1 .",
    "the remnant masses of stars more massive than @xmath36 11m@xmath1 are primarily determined by the amount of material that falls back onto the proto - ns after the launch of the explosion .",

    "the delayed explosion model produces far more remnants in the gap region : 33% at solar metallicity , and 17% at 0.1 solar metallicity .",

    "2011 ) .      for remnant masses below 11m@xmath1",
    ", we have two sources of error .",
    "first , uncertainties in modeling mass - loss and convection ( dredge - up ) can alter the lower limit for ns formation .",
    "we have assumed that at zero metallicity this lower limit drops to 6.3m@xmath1 , but a limit of 8m@xmath1 also fits within the errors of the calculations ( poelerands et al .",
    "second , differences in the results of core - collapse models lead to an error in the mass of the nss , allowing a range from 1.281.36m@xmath1 .",
    "observations placing constraints on the lowest neutron star mass could reduce this error .    for remnant masses produced by stars above 11m@xmath1 ,",
    "the uncertainties are significantly larger .",
    "our models are based on the assumption that the standard convective engine is the correct engine for most supernovae .",
    "we assume the maximum efficiency for ejecting stellar material ( i.e. the entire explosion energy is used to unbind the outer layers of the star ) .",
    "this assumption naturally leads to an underestimate of the final remnant mass .",
    "however , we also assume that the proto - neutron star lacks an energy reservoir , despite the fact that there are many mechanisms by which it could inject energy and affect the fallback .",
    "for example , proto - ns winds could generate additional energy in the explosion , thereby reducing fallback and decreasing the remnant mass .",
    "even more important , fryer et al .",
    "( 1996 , 2006 ) and fryer ( 2008 ) found that fallback material will drive outflows , self - limiting the total amount of fallback .",
    "as we discussed , other magnetic fields can also drive outflows , preventing fallback ( e.g. maeda et al .",
    "2007 , kasen & bildsten 2010 ) .",
    "all of these effects would drive our final remnant mass lower , and ignoring them overestimates the remnant mass .",
    "in addition , the mass distribution is sensitive both to the prescription used for mass loss in the stellar evolution codes and the stability of the stellar evolution codes . figure  [ fig : stellarcomp ] compares the results from three different sets of stellar models using three different stellar evolution codes : woosley et al .",

    "( 2002 ) results above 30@xmath31 .",
    "much of this difference is just a scaling factor : the primary difference in the mass - loss prescription is the coefficient in front of the metallicity - dependent term . for example , the limongi & chieffi ( 2006 ) solar metallicity models are very similar to the woosley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) models at @xmath61 solar metallicity . to determine the remnant mass distribution of the limongi & cheiffi ( 2006 ) models",
    ", we would use our remnant mass prescriptions ( e.g. equations  [ eq : massive ] ,  [ eq : massiverapid ] ) at @xmath61 solar metallicity .",
    "the jagged nature of our calculated mass estimate comes from instabilities in the mixing within the stellar evolution code . because of this , the core masses are not a smooth function of progenitor mass . the high remnant mass at @xmath62 in our rapid explosion models in fig .",
    "[ fig : mremwoor ] is a demonstration of how important this mixing can be .",
    "it is possible that better convection models will reduce the non - smooth dependence of core mass on progenitor mass ( see young et al .",
    "2005 ) , but this remains to be established .    we have also neglected the effects of binaries in the discussion above . because fallback occurs prior to the shock hitting the hydrogen envelope , and because the hydrogen envelope has very little binding energy , the primary effect of binaries on the mass distribution will be to reduce the maximum mass of the remnant to that of the helium core mass .",
    "fryer & kalogera ( 2001 ) have studied this effect , and find that it is negligible in the case of nss .",

    "the startrack models partially fill this gap , while the delayed explosion models conribute a significant population of remnants in the gap .",
    "these trends persist at lower metallicities ( fig .",
    "[ mrem1 ] ) .",
    "this striking gap in compact object mass ( @xmath64@xmath114 ) results from the sensitivity of the rapid models to the structure of the core . in the woosley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and woosley & heger ( 2007 ) models , enhanced burning in the late evolutionary stages leads to sharply different internal structures of stars with mass @xmath116@xmath117 . the internal structure in turn affects the supernova explosion and dramatically changes the mass of the remnant formed in the collapse .",
    "the changes are such that in this mass range we get an abrupt transition of compact object mass from @xmath118 to much higher mass , with no compact objects in between ( see figs .",
    "[ mrem2 ] and  [ mrem1 ] ) .",
    "this result agrees with studies of oconnor & ott ( 2011 ) , who find that the bounce compactness changes dramatically for these stars , altering their fate .",
    "the ultimate fate of these stars is sensitive to the late - stage burning , and if the burning changes with newer stellar evolution codes , the remnant mass distribution will change commensurately .",
    "we find that different supernova engines produce very different remnant mass distributions .",
    "we now review the observational constraints , and make comparisons with our predictions .",
    "one of the strongest observational constraints is the gap in bh mass between 25m@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "however , these studies do not include systems which do fall in the gap , such as 4u1700 - 37@xcite with a measured mass of @xmath119m@xmath1 .",
    "we expect some remnants to fall in the gap , but have difficulty estimating the number .",
    "our model predictions range from @xmath3615% for our rapid collapse to @xmath3640% for our delayed model in the 24m@xmath1 mass range ( section 4.4 ) .",
    "the high space velocity of 4u1700 - 37 points out another difficulty in using x - ray binary mass observations to constrain the remnant mass of supernovae : bh and ns kicks .",
    "many of the proposed ns kick mechanisms will also impart kicks onto bhs at formation . to impart a kick on the compact remnant from stellar collapse ,",
    "momentum conservation requires asymmetries .",
    "most compact remnant kick mechanisms either argue for asymmetries in the baryonic ejecta from the supernova or in the neutrino emission . here",
    "we review the implications for compact remnant kicks for our two explosion models utilizing these two kick mechanisms .    for ejecta driven - kicks ,",
    "no kick is imparted on bhs formed without supernova explosions ( since there is then no ejecta ) .",
    "low - mass bhs , on the other hand , are formed when the supernova explosion is delayed and the explosion is weak .",
    "if the convection in the supernova engine develops low - mode instabilities , the resulting explosion can be asymmetric  @xcite .",
    "the sasi engine is characterized by low - mode convection and several groups have argued that these large asymmetries will drive strong kicks  @xcite ; see fryer & young ( 2007 ) for a different interpretation of the low - mode convenction . if the low mode convection in the sasi engine produces strong kicks , the explosions with the longest delays will have the largest ejecta asymmetries and , hence , the strongest kick momenta .",
    "but these delayed supernova engines also produce the weakest supernova explosions , forming massive nss and low - mass bhs .",
    "we thus expect massive nss and low - mass bhs to have the highest momentum `` kick '' of any compact remnant .    for the rapid explosion model most bhs",
    "are formed without a supernova explosion , and only the small fraction of low - mass black holes will receive kicks .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the delayed model , where a much larger fraction of bhs are formed from fall back , and these low - mass bhs will have large kicks .    likewise , for most asymmetric neutrino kick mechanisms , the longer the delay in the supernova engine , the stronger the momentum asymmetry  @xcite",
    "again , massive nss and low mass bhs receive the largest kicks of any of our compact remnants under our delayed explosion model .    strong kicks unbind binary systems .",
    "if strong kicks occur in high - mass nss and low - mass bhs , these systems are more likely to be disrupted in the massive star collapse .",
    "this bias will make it difficult to use remnant mass distributions derived from x - ray binary systems without detailed population synthesis models .",
    "although our focus has been on estimating the compact remnant mass distribution , our models also make predictions for the distribution of explosion energies for core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the explosion energy distributions for our two convection - enhanced engines at both solar and zero metallicity are shown in figure  [ fig : distexpe ] .",
    "we have assumed that core - collapse supernovae from low - mass stars and electron capture supernovae all produce the same low - energy , @xmath120erg explosion . since the minimum mass decreases with metallicity",
    ", these supernovae dominate the explosions at low - metallicity , even with the relatively shallow salpeter imf ( @xmath59 ) .    from figure",
    "[ fig : distexpe ] we note that , except for the low mass supernovae such as electron capture supernovae , our rapid explosion model produces only strong explosions ( above @xmath8erg ) .",
    "the delayed model produces a broader range of explosion energies , with peak energies below that of the rapid explosion model . even at solar metallicity less than 50% of the explosions from the delayed engine have energies in excess of @xmath8erg .",
    "in principal the distribution of supernova explosion energies , if sufficiently accurate , could distinguish between our two engines .",
    "for example , a low - energy explosion from a massive star is almost certainly arising from a delayed explosion .",
    "similarly , any explosion above @xmath121erg produced by a slowly rotating star is likely to result from a rapid explosion .",
    "gravitational waves are expected to provide new constraints on the formation of compact remnants .",
    "we use the startrack population synthesis code , incorporating the binary prescriptions discussed above , to calculate delayed ( e.g. sasi ) and rapid models for the initial  remnant mass relation . additionally , we employ two models of common envelope evolution . in the first ( model",
    "a ) we employ the standard energy balance ( webbink 1984 ) to calculate the outcome of common envelope evolution with a hertzsprung gap donor . in the second model ( b )",
    "we assume that , when a hertzsprung gap star fills its roche lobe and starts the common envelope phase , it merges with its companion and ends its binary evolution .",
    "the same energy balance is used to compute the common envelope for any type of donor in both models .",
    "since many bh - bh progenitors experience common envelope evolution with a hertzsprung gap donor , the birth and merger rates of bh - bh binaries are greatly reduced in model b ( for details and the physical motivation see belczynski et al .",
    "we consider two metallicities @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( approximately covering the range of metallicity observed in local universe ) .",
    "we focus on binary stars that form double bh systems ( bh - bh ) at the end of their evolution .",
    "we predict the distribution of chirp masses for the two supernova engine models ( see fig.[fig : chirpa ] and [ fig : chirpb ] ) , and find a striking difference .",
    "for the delayed model the chirp masses start from @xmath124 , whereas for the rapid model the lowest chirp masses are @xmath125 for models",
    "these very different chirp mass distributions are the result of the differing initial - remnant mass relations presented in figures  [ mrem2 ] and  [ mrem1 ] . in the delayed model bhs",

    "the chirp mass distribution starts at a low value , @xmath127 ( the chirp mass of two @xmath128 black holes is @xmath129 ) .",
    "in contrast , in the rapid supernova engine model , there are no bhs with mass below @xmath130 , and therefore the chirp mass distribution starts at @xmath131 .",
    "the origin of this remnant gap is described and referenced in sec .  [ relations ] .    in table",
    "[ numall ] we present galactic merger rates for our models for bh - bh binaries .",
    "rates are calculated for a milky way type galaxy ( 10 gyr of continuous star formation at a rate of @xmath132 ) , as described in belczynski et al .",
    "the change of rates with metallicity , and between our two models for common envelope evolution , are fully discussed in belczynski et al .",
