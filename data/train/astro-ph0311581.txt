    "the last few years have brought fundamental progress in understanding the suspected connection between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , characterized by non - thermal emission from a massive ( @xmath1 ) black hole ( bh ) , and normal galaxies , whose extended emission is thermal . in particular ,",
    "now 1 ) there is robust evidence that quasars reside in galaxies ( bahcall et al . 1997 ) ; 2 ) it is established that massive `` quiescent '' bhs are also present in the central regions of normal galaxies ( magorrian et al . 1998 ) ; 3 ) a statistical correlation between bh mass and mass or velocity dispersion of the host galaxy s bulge exists ( gebhardt et al . 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , which suggests a common evolution for galaxies and their central , massive bhs ; 4 ) the previous correlations hold for normal as well as agn - host galaxies ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ) .    for agn with typical masses of @xmath1 ,",
    "the bulk of the accretion radiation is emitted in the soft x - ray and euv / uv range .",
    "a fraction of this optically thick radiation is compton - upscattered by a corona of electrons surrounding the bh .",
    "this process is thought to produce the typical power law x - ray spectra observed in all agn .",
    "the primary soft x - ray / euv radiation of the accretion disk also ionizes the surrounding gas , producing the well - known agn emission lines . at radio frequencies ,",
    "the core luminosity of the agn is due to synchrotron emission by relativistic electrons immersed in a seemingly global magnetic field .",
    "it is conceivable that these electrons are the same which compton - upscatter the disk photons .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether there is a direct correlation between radio , optical and x - ray emission in the central part of the agn where the accretion disk is located .",
    "while information in the radio and x - ray bands is already available from all - sky surveys like the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , condon 1998 ) , first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ; becker 1995 ) and the rosat bright survey ( rbs , schwope 2000 ) , optical data for the central kiloparsec of agn are more difficult to obtain .",
    "indeed , in modeling agn and their host galaxies , the information contained in the central pixels has been usually rejected ( see e.g. virani 2000 ) . with a new well - tested , well - performing and robust fitting algorithm ( kuhlbrodt 2001 ) , it has recently been possible to model both the host galaxy _ and _ the nucleus from optical images .    here",
    "we apply this decomposition algorithm to a new sample of objects , and use the results of the decomposition to study the relations between the properties of the central point source , in particular the x - ray ( @xmath2 kev ) , optical ( r band ) and radio ( 1.49 ghz ) emission . after presenting the sample selection in  1 and the catalog data in  2 ,",
    "the relations between the different parameters are described in  3 , and discussed in  4 .",
    "unless specified differently , a value of h@xmath3=50 km mpc@xmath4s@xmath4 has been used throughout this paper .",
    "we used the rosat bright survey ( rbs , schwope 2000 ) , consisting of the @xmath5 2000 brightest , optically identified sources detected during the rosat all sky survey ( rass , voges 1999 ) . selecting at x - rays has the advantage that the contribution of the emission from the host galaxy is small with respect to the agn .",
    "we selected the strongest ( rosat pspc count rate ( cr ) above 0.3 cts s@xmath4 in the 0.52.0 kev range ) , local ( 0.009@xmath6z@xmath60.1 ) agn in order to achieve reasonable spatial resolution with ground - based optical observations .",
    "the sample consists of 93 agn ( black symbols in fig .",
    "[ lxz ] ) . at the time when the work started ,",
    "all of them were classified in ned as sy1 galaxies , but in the meantime about 30% of them have been found to be nlsy1 ( veron - cetty & veron 2001 ) .",
    "the size of the sample thus allows us to work with 2 independent , complete samples , sy1 ( 64 ) and nlsy1 ( 29 ) , with comparable x - ray luminosity . in both cases",
    "the observer has a direct view of the agn , i.e. unobstructed by the torus .",
    "all optical data was acquired in dedicated observing runs , described in detail elsewhere ( salvato 2002 ; salvato 2003 , in preparation ) . here",
    "we give only some brief characteristics . in order to explore the relationship of nuclear luminosities in various wavelengths we collected data from public catalogs for the x - ray and radio wavelengths .",
    "+ _ optical data . _ the entire sample has been observed in the r band with a typical exposure time of 10 minutes at the 1.5 m danish telescope ( bessel r filter ) at la silla and of 20 minutes at the 1.2 m telescope ( johnson r filter ) at calar alto .",
    "we have applied the two - dimensional decomposition algorithm ( kuhlbrodt 2001 ) to all images , which takes into account the point spread function ( psf ) of the corresponding image .",
    "a three - component model has been applied , involving a point - like nuclear component , a bulge component with a r@xmath7 radial dependence , and an exponential disk component . besides the spatial parameters we therefore obtain magnitudes of these three components .",
    "these derived magnitudes have been corrected for galactic absorption , using the maps of dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) and converted to the visual extinction as derived by predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) . a comparison of our fit parameters ( colors , disk and bulge parameters , etc . ) with a sub - sample of galaxies studied already earlier ( e.g. mclure & dunlop 2001 ) , reveals perfect agreement ( details in salvato 2002 ) , and thus provides some confidence that also the nuclear light component is fitted correctly . _ in  4 , this optical nuclear luminosity is supposed to represent the accretion disk surrounding the bh . _ + _ black hole masses . _ bh masses are computed from the derived bulge luminosity , using a unique equation for sy1 and nlsy1 as in mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) : @xmath8/)= @xmath9 which is valid under the assumption that differences between sy1 and nlsy1 are due to geometrical rather than physical effects .",
    "our masses ( tab . [ kaspi ] ) , after correcting for the different cosmology , agree well with those derived by reverberation mapping ( kaspi 2000 ) for the common sources .",
    "+ _ x - ray luminosity . _",
    "typically , non - active galaxies have very low x - ray luminosities ; thus the x - ray emission at a rosat / pspc count rate above 0.3 cts / s is likely produced only in the nuclei of agn .",
    "however , the x - ray emission is not directly related to the accretion disk , because due to the canonical temperatures of the disk emission peaks in the uv .",
    "the x - ray luminosity has been computed using the x - ray flux in the 0.52.0 kev ( tab . 2 in schwope 2000 ) , assuming a power law spectrum with photon index of 2 and applying the corresponding galactic absorption and @xmath10 correction .",
    "we caution that this approach yields unreliable and inconsistent results for few nlsy1 in our sample , having very steep , soft x - ray spectra .",
    "+ _ radio data .",
    "_ we cross - correlated our sample with the nvss and first radio catalogues , and , owing to their limited sky coverage , 53 matches were found .",
    "both surveys are centered at 1.49 ghz ( @xmath11 = 20 cm ) , where the synchrotron emission of our targets may be associated with the nuclear activity but also with the spatially - extended star formation activity , if any .",
    "nvss and first map the sky at different spatial resolution ( 45and 5 , respectively ) , and thus allow to disentangle the two potential contributions .",
    "in fact , if the unresolved agn produces all the radio emission , the fluxes listed in the two catalogues must be consistent ; otherwise the nvss flux must be larger .",
    "a flux - flux plot shows that galaxies with and without the extra contribution to the radio emission from star formation activity can be separated by a line of equation @xmath12 .",
    "this selection criterion is robust against a maximal 20% variability of the agn radio flux ( falcke 2001 ) .",
    "thus the radio luminosities of 21 out of 53 galaxies are attributed only to their nuclear activity .",

    "_ optical vs. x - ray emission . _",
    "a strong linear relation is found between the optical accretion disk and the x - ray luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ lpsflx ] ) , of the form @xmath21 where the coefficients `` a '' and `` b '' have been determined separately for the whole sample ( all ) and for the sy1 and nlsy1 galaxies alone , respectively ( tab .",
    "the consistency of the relations is confirmed by the spearman rank correlation coefficient , @xmath18 , which is higher than 0.7 . from the plot and the table it is obvious that sy1 and nlsy1 behave in the same way .",
    "the scatter is about @xmath200.5 dex .",
    "there are ( at least ) two obvious reasons for this scatter : first , optical and x - ray fluxes have not been measured simultaneously , and due to the known variability of seyferts a factor of a few can easily be accounted for .",
    "second , the x - ray fluxes have been computed on the basis of the total measured counts and an _ assumed _ power law slope .",
    "it would have been more correct ( though not possible in most cases due to photon statistics ) to fit also the power law slope , and thus obtain a more accurate x - ray flux .",
    "one may think that the @xmath22 line may produce a non - negligible contribution to the continuum emission in the r - band .",
    "for testing this hypothesis , the template spectrum of a sy1 has been convolved with the transmission curve of the r - band filter .",
    "we computed the dilution factor from h@xmath23 , for different [ nii]/h@xmath23 ratios and for different ew(h@xmath23 ) , also taking into account that h@xmath23 may be enhanced by galaxy interaction .",
    "the dilution factor is not more than 1% and thus being negligible .",
    "+ _ radio vs. x - ray emission .",
    "_ we also find that the x - ray emission correlates well with the radio continuum emission . as in the previous case ,",
    "the relation is linear , and has been fit in the form @xmath24 the coefficients `` c '' and `` d '' are listed in columns 4 and 5 of tab .",
    "here we used only those 21 galaxies for which we have information about nuclear radio emission .",
    "as previously , the linear regression has been computed for all objects , and for the sy1 ( 14 galaxies ) and nlsy1 ( 7 galaxies ) independently . due to the small size of the two subsamples",
    "the errors are quite high and the spearman rank correlation coefficient in not really reliable .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that nlsy1 may have a steeper slope than the sy1 galaxies .",
    "+    _ optical vs bh masses . _ the optical luminosity of the accretion disk is also correlating with the bh mass computed according to  3.2 ( fig .",
    "[ lpsflogmbh ] ) .",
    "the solid line indicates the predicted relationship for an optically thick accretion disk around a non - rotating bh ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , where for a given bh mass the r band flux depends on the temperature ( and thus accretion rate @xmath25 ) of the object * ( @xmath26 * chosen here ) .",
    "the curvature of this line is basically a measure of the differing bolometric correction for varying bh mass ( and thus temperature ) .",
    "we find that the optical luminosity of the nuclei of seyfert galaxies correlates with the power - law x - ray emission , the radio emission from the core as well as the black hole mass .",
    "these relations are not driven by the malmquist bias , which is introduced whenever a sample is selected via a flux - limit .",
    "in fact , the additional 9 sy1 galaxies with cr @xmath6 0.3 cts / s and nvss / first counterpart confirm the general trend ( see fig .",
    "[ lxlr ] , grey asterisks . )",
    "the correlation of the optical nuclear luminosity with the x - ray luminosity could potentially be understood if the canonical blackbody - like continuum emission from the accretion disk is enhanced due to irradiation by soft x - rays , so that an increase in the x - ray flux would create a larger optical flux .",
    "this is a well - known effect in x - ray binaries , though it has not been possible so far to quantify this relation , as it depends on too many parameters ( e.g. x - ray spectrum of the irradiating source , temperature and ionization state of the disk , geometry of the disk ) .",
    "kriss ( 1982 ) and koratkar ( 1995 ) found a strong correlation between the soft x - ray luminosity and the broad @xmath27 and @xmath28 line luminosity , respectively , in quasars and sy1 galaxies .",
    "it has been argued that an increased accretion disc flux would not only cause a larger photoionization ( and thus h@xmath23 flux ) , but also provide more seed photons which would be up - scattered to produce the power law x - ray spectrum , and thus the x - ray flux .",
    "this effect is unlikely to explain our correlation , since simulations show that the contribution of the h@xmath23 emission line to the @xmath29 band flux is less than 1% .    including the correlation with the radio luminosity leads to the consideration of a less direct , yet at least as plausible , coupling between the luminosities in the different wavelengths , namely via the electron corona which is supposed to surround the accretion disk .",
    "the electron temperature distribution is expected to depend on the accretion disk properties , primarily the accretion rate and disk temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature and density of the corona determine the efficiency of the compton scattering , and thus directly determine the slope and power of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "thus , a change in e.g. the accretion rate would not only lead to a varying optical emission , but via the corona also to a varying x - ray and radio emission .",
    "the physical relation between the processes which produce the emission in the x - ray and radio remains at the level of speculation . in microquasars ,",
    "the stellar - binary analogs of jet emitting objects in our galaxy , rau & greiner ( 2002 ) have recently found a similar correlation between the strength of the radio emission and the x - ray power law slope .",
    "owing to the smaller timescales involved in microquasars ( due to their smaller black hole mass ) , a whole continuum of jet strengths has been observed from bright , spatially resolved ejections over `` baby - jets '' down to quasi - steady radio ( synchrotron ) emission . adopting this similarity",
    ", one could argue that the core radio emission in seyfert galaxies witnesses matter outflow from the central black hole .",
    "objects with higher activity at x - ray wavelengths , i.e. higher accretion rate , may thus also show higher mass outflows from their central engine , thus implying a larger radio flux .",
    "indeed , this is what has been found when comparing the x - ray and radio fluxes of galactic black hole binaries in the low / hard state : the radio flux scales as x - ray flux to the power of 0.7 ( gallo  2003 ) .",
    "surprisingly , this is ( within the errors ) the same correlation as we find ( coefficient @xmath30 in tab .",
    "certainly , further investigations are necessary to understand the processes involved and their interrelation , but it is encouraging that seemingly the same processes are at work in agn and galactic black hole binaries .",
