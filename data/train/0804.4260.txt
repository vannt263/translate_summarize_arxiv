    "the digitized responses from the phototubes mounted on the tof counters are then checked and compared with a database .",
    "this allows monitoring of the performance of the tof system .",
    "the tof system , which is crucial for particle identification , is an array of plastic scintillation counters , that measure the relative arrival times of particles coming from electron - positron annihilations generated by the bepcii collider .",
    "it is composed of a barrel array with 88 scintillation counters in each of two layers , and endcap ( ec ) arrays with 48 fan shaped scintillators in each .",

    "the optical fibers without jacketing are closely packed into a circular cross section , which is approximately 2.25 mm in diameter .",
    "the ratio of the core diameter to the buffer diameter is large enough that the light coupling into the fibers is reasonably efficient . a 6.35 mm outer diameter by 5.0 cm long custom ferrule here provides good concentricity between the core bundle and its outside diameter and is mechanically substantial enough to clamp to .",
