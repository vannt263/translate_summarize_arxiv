    "consider the statistical deconvolution model @xmath9 where @xmath2 is a real - valued random variable with unknown probability density @xmath10 and @xmath3 is an error term independent of @xmath2 that is distributed according to the probability measure @xmath4 on @xmath11 .",
    "the law @xmath12 of @xmath13 equals the convolution @xmath14 and we denote its density by @xmath15 .",

    "the _ deconvolution problem _ is about recovering the unknown density @xmath7 from the noisy observations @xmath18 .",
    "it has been extensively studied : we refer to carroll and hall @xcite , stefanski @xcite , stefanski and carroll @xcite , fan @xcite , diggle and hall @xcite , goldenshluger @xcite , pensky and vidakovic @xcite , delaigle and gijbels @xcite , hesse and meister @xcite , johnstone et  al .",

    "one key lesson from the aforementioned literature is that a lower bound on the regularity of the signal @xmath3 is necessary to be able to estimate @xmath7 with reasonable accuracy .",
    "this lower bound is often quantified by a lower bound on the decay of the fourier transform @xmath19 $ ] of @xmath4 and fourier inversion techniques are applied to construct estimators for @xmath7 .",
    "most of the literature on this problem ( with some notable exceptions , to be discussed below ) deals with the @xmath20-theory , that is , involves the loss function @xmath21 and is often restricted to the case of periodic and hence compactly supported @xmath7 .",
    "these restrictions are theoretically convenient , in particular since fourier analysis - based methods can be used without too much difficulty , using the parseval  plancherel isometry",
    ". however , a sound understanding of the local behavior of deconvolution estimators seems to be of significant statistical importance . in particular",
    "a theory that could deal with sup - norm loss @xmath22 could be used in the construction of confidence bands for the object @xmath7 of statistical interest . a fortiori it is not at all clear whether the intuitions from @xmath20-theory carry over to pointwise and uniform loss functions in generality , bearing in mind that @xmath20-convergence properties of fourier series can give a completely inadequate picture of their pointwise or uniform behaviour .    in the present article ,",
    "we use methods from empirical process theory to derive finite - sample sup - norm risk bounds for deconvolution density estimators based on fourier inversion with meyer ( or similar band - limited ) wavelets .",
    "these estimators were studied in pensky and vidakovic @xcite and johnstone et al .",
    "@xcite , and have since been successfully used in inverse problems .",
    "our results hold under minimal assumptions on the density @xmath7 and the distribution @xmath4 : we require @xmath7 to be bounded , which is unavoidable if one considers sup - norm loss , and we assume that the fourier transform of @xmath4 is nonzero on the intervals of support of the meyer wavelet , which is necessary to define any estimator based on fourier inversion and which also makes @xmath7 identifiable .",
    "our risk bounds imply rates of convergence for the deconvolution density estimator that are optimal in global sup - norm loss , without any moment or support restrictions whatsoever , both in the severely ill - posed case ( where linear methods suffice ) , as well as in the moderately ill - posed case ( where we propose a suitable thresholding method ) . to be more precise , given the law @xmath4 of the error term and a density @xmath7 belonging to some besov body @xmath23 with unknown @xmath24 , we devise purely data - driven estimators @xmath25 such that , for every @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the minimax rate of convergence in sup - norm loss over the given besov body and given the error law @xmath4 .",
    "we also obtain a result of this kind for the case where @xmath7 is `` supersmooth , '' that is , has an exponentially decaying fourier transform . to the best of our knowledge , the minimax lower bounds derived in this article are also new .",
    "we should note that the main delicate mathematical point in this work is to link the @xmath20-based procedure of fourier inversion to a pointwise , or even uniform , control of the random fluctuations of the centered linear density estimator ; this problem is already implicit in the conditions on @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath7 imposed by stefanski and caroll @xcite , fan @xcite and goldenshluger @xcite , who considered pointwise loss .",
    "even stronger assumptions were imposed in the nice paper bissantz et al .",
    "@xcite , wherein the limiting ( extremal - type ) distribution of the uniform deviations over compact sets of certain kernel deconvolution density estimators for @xmath7 is derived  this is the only result that we are aware of in the literature on deconvolution estimation that deals with sup - norm loss in the moderately ill - posed case ( stefanski @xcite deals only with the simpler severely ill - posed case ) .",
    "our empirical process approach gives results under minimal conditions and also yields the relevant concentration inequalities that allow for a satisfactory treatment of adaptation , which the results in bissantz et al .",
    "@xcite do not address .",
    "we should note that applying empirical process tools in this setting is not at all straightforward : the usual approach would be to show that certain kernels are of bounded variation and thus the associated sets of translates and dilates are of vapnik  chervonenkis type ( e.g. , nolan and pollard @xcite , einmahl and mason @xcite , gin and guillou @xcite ) , but this does not seem viable in the deconvolution problem , due to the fact that the bounded variation norm does not possess a nice fourier - analytical characterization .",
    "we can , however , solve this problem by combining recent results on vc properties of functions of quadratic variation in gin and nickl @xcite with littlewood  paley theory and the fact that wavelet bases are compatible with both the @xmath20- and @xmath29-structure simultaneously ; see lemma [ entropy ] for this key result .",
    "our results can be used to construct confidence bands in the deconvolution problem and we discuss this in some detail below , as well as relations to work in @xcite .",
    "we suggest a new approach to nonparametric confidence bands based on rademacher symmetrization , in a similar vein as in recent work of koltchinskii @xcite .",
    "while these confidence bands may be conservative , they allow for an explicit finite - sample analysis under minimal assumptions .",
    "let us finally remark that this article also contains new results for the standard density estimation problem ( where @xmath4 equals dirac measure @xmath30 at @xmath31 ) . in this field ,",
    "our results contribute in several respects : first , vapnik  chervonenkis properties of wavelet projection kernels have thus far only been derived for daubechies wavelets @xcite and battle  lemari wavelets @xcite , and the present article achieves the same for wavelets with compactly supported fourier transform ( e.g. , meyer wavelets ) .",
    "furthermore , our main adaptation result , theorem [ result - threshold ] , is completely free of any moment conditions and thus shows , as may have been suspected , that the moment conditions imposed in theorem 8 in @xcite are not necessary .",
    "finally , the confidence bands we suggest can also be used for regular wavelet density estimators and we are not aware of any other results on global confidence bands in density estimation , except for the rather technical ones in @xcite .",
    "we start with some preliminary definitions and facts . for any lebesgue integrable function @xmath32 the fourier transform @xmath33 $ ] of @xmath34 is defined as @xmath33(t ) = \\int_{\\mathbb{r}}h(x)e^{-itx}\\,dx$ ] , @xmath35 and we use the natural extension of @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "we further denote by @xmath38 the inverse fourier transform so that @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "the fourier transform of the density @xmath15 from ( [ deconvolution - model ] ) is then given by @xmath41(t ) = f[f](t)f[\\varphi](t)\\ ] ] for every @xmath42 .",
    "another standard property of the fourier transform we shall frequently use is its scaling property : for @xmath43 and @xmath44 the function @xmath45 has fourier transform @xmath46(t ) = \\alpha^{-1}f[h](\\alpha^{-1}t)$ ] .",

    "now , denote by @xmath54 the inner product in the hilbert space @xmath55 .",
    "the density @xmath7 can be formally expanded into its wavelet series @xmath56 where the coefficients are given by @xmath57 , @xmath58 , .",
    "as is well known , the regularity properties of a function @xmath7 can be measured by the decay of their wavelet coefficients .",

    "the besov space @xmath62 is defined as the set of functions @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the norms of the sequence spaces @xmath65 , and with the usual modification in the case @xmath66 . moreover , for any @xmath67 , the besov ball of radius @xmath68 is defined as @xmath69 .      before we construct explicit estimators for the density @xmath7 of @xmath2 in the deconvolution model ( [ deconvolution - model ] ) , we derive a result that gives a benchmark for the best performance of _ any _ estimator @xmath70 .",
    "more precisely , we derive lower bounds for the minimax rate of convergence of @xmath71 in sup - norm loss , uniformly over besov bodies of densities @xmath7 under various assumptions on the error law @xmath4 .",
    "we will subsequently show that these lower bounds can be attained by certain wavelet - based estimators and are thus optimal .    to this end , define the minimax @xmath72-risk over the hlder class @xmath73 as @xmath74 where the infimum is taken over all possible estimators @xmath75 .",
    "note that an estimator in the deconvolution problem means any measurable function of a sample @xmath76 from density @xmath14 that takes values in the space of bounded functions on @xmath11 .",
