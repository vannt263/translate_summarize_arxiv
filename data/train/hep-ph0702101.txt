    "deuteron - gold ( ) collisions have been extensively studied at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , both for their intrinsic interest and as a control experiment  @xcite to judge the suppression seen in central gold - gold ( ) collisions at sufficiently high transverse momenta ( @xmath7 )  @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly , not only  data , but recent extended @xmath7 coverage  data also display a suppressed nuclear modification factor in central collisions@xcite .",
    "this motivates a study of possible mechanisms that may result in a nuclear modification factor smaller than unity at sufficiently high transverse momenta ( @xmath8 gev / c ) in central  collisions .",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath9 compares the spectra of produced particles in  collisions to a hypothetical scenario in which the nuclear collisions are assumed to be a superposition of the appropriate number of nucleon - nucleon collisions . in the transverse momentum window @xmath10",
    "gev / c @xmath11  gev / c , the nuclear modification factors are dominated by the cronin peak  @xcite .",
    "several physical pictures of this enhancement have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "one family of models  @xcite advances an explanation of the cronin effect in terms of the interplay between nuclear shadowing  @xcite and the multiple scattering of particles propagating in the strongly - interacting medium ( multiscattering )  @xcite . using the hijing shadowing prescription  @xcite , our model gave a reasonable description of the cronin effect in central collisions at midrapidity  @xcite .",
    "at the same time , we obtained nuclear modification factors close to unity at high transverse momenta ( @xmath12  gev / c @xmath13  gev / c ) .    in the high-@xmath7 region",
    "multiscattering no longer affects @xmath9 .",
    "it is then natural to ask if nuclear shadowing can explain suppression effects at high @xmath7 . in particular , since at @xmath14  @xmath15gev we are in the emc region of the shadowing function for @xmath12  gev / c @xmath13  gev / c , we ask if the emc effect  @xcite plays a role in understanding these experiments .",
    "in this paper we first investigate  collisions at the highest rhic energies and the role of the emc effect at transverse momenta up to @xmath16 gev / c .",
    "we then examine whether recent shadowing parameterizations incorporating theoretical uncertainties for the first time@xcite can account for the experimental information .",
    "we also display calculational results with a modest energy loss using energy - loss parameters applied earlier to  data .",
    "finally we extend our considerations to the energy range of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] displays recent phenix data ( triangles with error bars)@xcite for the most central  collisions , where a high-@xmath7 suppression is clearly seen .",
    "while incoherent multiscattering can only lead to enhancement in @xmath9 , nuclear shadowing displays two regions where an @xmath17 can be expected : ( i ) at small @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , and ( ii ) in the emc region ( @xmath20 )  @xcite . at rhic energies",
    "the small-@xmath18 region is inconsequential at @xmath8  gev / c .",
    "thus we focus attention on the emc effect as a possible mechanism for the measured suppression .",
    "various shadowing parameterizations developed in the last 15 years  @xcite show different behaviors at small-@xmath18 , but the emc region appears rather robust in most models .    to see the effect of the emc region ,",
    "we calculate pion production in a wide momentum range . for this purpose",
    "we use a perturbative qcd improved parton model  @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the factorization theorem and generates the invariant cross section as a convolution of ( nuclear ) parton distribution functions @xmath21 , perturbative qcd cross sections @xmath22 , and fragmentation functions @xmath23 .",
    "we perform the calculation in leading order , following refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the factorization and fragmentation scales , respectively , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are momentum fractions , and @xmath30-s stand for two - dimensional transverse momentum vectors .",
    "the initial state effects of shadowing and multiscattering are included following the treatment in refs .",
    "@xcite .    since the effects we investigate are on the @xmath31 level , it is customary to present the obtained results on a linear scale in terms of the nuclear modification factor @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the average number of binary collisions in the various impact - parameter bins .    together with the data in central  collisions , we display our results with several shadowing parameterizations in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we use the hijing shadowing including nuclear multiscattering ( solid lines ) , the eks shadowing ( where multiscattering is represented by strong anti - shadowing ) ( dashed line ) , and the hkn parameterization ( with and without nuclear multiscattering , dotted and dash - dotted lines , respectively ) .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the suppression associated with the emc effect shows up at transverse momenta @xmath34  gev / c in all models considered , and does not explain the suppression in the data at around @xmath2  gev / c .",
    "the cronin peak at @xmath35  gev / c is best reproduced by the hijing parameterization .",
    "the `` hkn+multiscattering '' model appears to overshoot the data at low @xmath7 , while it gives very similar results to hijing at @xmath36  gev / c .",
    "since the uncertainty of the hkn nuclear parton distribution functions is also available , we next examine the theoretical uncertainty of the description .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the effect of the uncertainty given by the hkn shadowing parameterization is illustrated on the nuclear modification factor , @xmath9 .",
    "the errors are calculated by the hessian method , using the original code of the hkn group .",
    "the mean value as a function of @xmath7 is represented by a solid line , surrounded by an error band of approximately @xmath37 .",
    "although the data fall within this band at low @xmath7 , for @xmath38  gev / c the observed suppression is stronger than allowed by this calculation .    since we are not aware of any other initial - state suppression , we consider physics operating in the final state .",
    "in particular , jet energy loss suggests itself  @xcite .",
    "this idea is supported by the presence of a minor energy loss effect in peripheral  collisions  @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath39  fm for the average static transverse size of the traversed medium , and the usual glv parameters of @xmath40  fm mean free path and @xmath41  gev screening mass , we calculate the effect of jet energy loss on the nuclear modification factor for central  collisions .",
    "this is displayed in fig .",
    "it can be seen that inclusion of this energy loss results in a parallel down - shift of @xmath9 relative to curves in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the slope of the data as a function of @xmath7 is still very different from that of the calculated results . nevertheless , taking into account all experimental and theoretical uncertainties",
    ", one could consider the displayed result with @xmath42 to be an acceptable compromise .",
    "jet energy loss depends on the transverse parton density , which relates to the measurable hadronic quantity @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the transverse area of the deconfined region . assuming a realistic geometry for central  and  collisions and considering the experimental data on @xmath45",
    ", we obtain only a factor of @xmath10 difference for the transverse parton densities between the  and  cases . on this basis",
    ", one could expect the jet - quenching effect in  to be even stronger than shown by the calculated band in fig .",
    "however , jet energy loss in non - thermal matter is an open question , which we plan to investigate in a forthcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "we expect that the emc region will shift to higher and higher transverse momenta with increasing collision energy . at the same time , due to the increasing parton density , the energy loss should also become larger .",
    "we repeat our calculation for @xmath46 collisions at @xmath47  gev and @xmath48  tev to display these tendencies .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4 . following the ordering of the lines on the left of the figure , the top curve represents the results with hijing shadowing from fig .",
    "the second line corresponds to a similar calculation ( i.e. hijing shadowing , no energy loss ) at @xmath49  gev c.m .",
    "the next line shows the result at @xmath48  tev without jet quenching , while the dotted and dashed lines illustrate the effect of energy loss .",
    "first we took @xmath39 fm for the transverse size of the medium , and used the value of @xmath40  fm as earlier .",
    "the introduction of a smaller @xmath50 value to represent the increase in the transverse density of colored scattering centers with increasing c.m .",
    "energy gives @xmath51 .",
    "it can be seen that the dip corresponding to the emc effect shifts to higher transverse momenta with increasing energy as expected . while @xmath9 is above unity at @xmath35 gev / c for 0.2  tev ( cronin effect ) , at @xmath52 and @xmath48  tev , where we are deep in the shadowing region at these transverse momenta , at most a small ripple appears on @xmath9 , which is rising towards one with increasing transverse momentum in this region .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath50 at @xmath48  tev is minimal at transverse momenta @xmath53  gev / c , but quite significant at @xmath54  gev / c @xmath55  gev / c .",
    "in conclusion , while this solution appears initially tempting , the emc effect does not explain the unexpected suppression seen at @xmath56  gev / c in @xmath9 at @xmath14  @xmath15gev .",
    "taking into account experimental uncertainties as well as the uncertainties of the hkn nuclear parton distribution functions , the experimental and theoretical results can be brought into agreement using a non - negligible amount of final state parton energy loss ( with standard opacity parameters ) .",
    "the non - thermal nature of the  system casts some doubt on the parameter values .",
    "the presence of jet quenching in the  system is somewhat surprising at first sight , but is justified by the similarity ( within a factor of @xmath10 ) of the real transverse densities in the  and  systems .    for lhc energies we do not have a fully reliable baseline calculation at present .",
    "it is clearly seen , however , that shadowing ( i.e suppression ) will dominate the momentum region up to @xmath57  gev / c .",
    "the effect of final state interactions ( jet energy loss ) may also reduce the nuclear modification factor , especially in this momentum region .",
    "the emc dip in the nuclear modification factor moves toward higher and higher transverse momenta with increasing energy .",
