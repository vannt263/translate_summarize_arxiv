    "the kaluza - klein programme , i.e. the idea that the higgs and yukawa sectors of the standard model of particle physics could have their origins in a simpler but higher - dimensional theory , remains as attractive today as when it was when first proposed  @xcite . in the original idea of kaluza and klein , and its non - abelian generalisation with a homogeneous internal space @xmath13 for @xmath14",
    "a closed subgroup of a compact lie group @xmath15 , the higher - dimensional theory was pure gravity but in later schemes einstein - yang - mills theories in higher dimensions were introduced  @xcite .",
    "this has the potential to provide a unification of the gauge and higgs sectors in higher dimensions , while the coupling of fermions to the higher - dimensional gauge theory naturally induces yukawa couplings after dimensional reduction . for certain coset spaces , particularly the complex projective plane",
    ", the inclusion of topologically non - trivial internal fluxes can induce the chiral fermionic spectrum of quarks and leptons of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the pioneering scheme realizing these constructions is called `` coset space dimensional reduction ''  @xcite , though a generic problem with such reductions has been that they are unable to generate chiral gauge theories , without some additional modifications  @xcite . in coset space dimensional reduction , constraints are imposed on the higher - dimensional fields ensuring that they are invariant under the @xmath15-action up to gauge transformations .",
    "this amounts to studying embeddings of the isometry group @xmath15 of the coset space , or of its holonomy subgroup @xmath14 , in the gauge group of the higher - dimensional theory and the solutions of the constraints are then formally identified with the lowest modes of the harmonic towers of fields .",
    "on the other hand , the `` equivariant dimensional reduction '' of gauge theories naturally incorporates the topology of background fields on @xmath13 which are gauged with respect to the holonomy group @xmath14 .",
    "although similar in spirit to the coset space dimensional reduction scheme , equivariant dimensional reduction systematically constructs the unique field configurations on the higher - dimensional space which are equivariant with respect to the internal isometry group @xmath15 , and reduces yang - mills theory to a quiver gauge theory based on a quiver ( with relations ) which is determined entirely by the representation theory of the lie groups @xmath15 and @xmath14 . as in coset space dimensional reduction , there is no _ a priori _ relation between the gauge group @xmath16 of the higher - dimensional field theory and the groups @xmath15 or @xmath14 , and the resulting gauge group of the dimensionally reduced field theory is a subgroup of @xmath16 .",
    "this differs from the usual kaluza - klein reductions where the isometry group ( or the holonomy group ) is identified with the gauge group .",
    "the general formalism is described in  @xcite .",
    "it has been applied in a variety of contexts in  @xcite when the internal coset space is the projective line @xmath17 .",
    "dimensional reduction over the fuzzy sphere @xmath18 is also considered in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of the vacuum states of such quiver gauge theories performed in  @xcite to an example with non - abelian holonomy , the projective plane @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding quiver gauge theories have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "this example is rich enough to capture some general features of the vacua of the quiver gauge theories which are induced by reduction over generic coset spaces @xmath13 .",
    "when the internal space is the projective plane @xmath4 , the equivariant dimensional reduction of gauge fields naturally comes with @xmath2 monopoles and @xmath3 instantons , in contrast to @xmath17 where only monopoles are present , and this introduces essential differences from the @xmath17 case . as in the kaluza - klein approach , the mass scale of the dimensionally reduced field theory is set by the size of the internal space .",
    "we obtain a higgs sector of the lower - dimensional gauge theory with a higgs potential that leads to dynamical symmetry breaking , as a direct consequence of the non - trivial internal fluxes , and we work out the complete physical particle content and masses for a number of explicit symmetry breaking hierarchies . as in the case of reduction over @xmath17 , a yukawa sector of the reduced fermionic field theory is naturally induced .",
    "the harmonic expansion over @xmath4 induces an infinite tower of massive fermions in the reduced field theory , but the topologically non - trivial gauge fields on the internal @xmath4 necessarily also induce exactly massless chiral modes in the reduced field theory . as in the @xmath17 case ,",
    "some of the massless spinor fields which arise as a consequence of the index theorem on the internal space acquire masses through their yukawa couplings , but in general not all of them .",
    "there is a number of other differences between the equivariant dimensional reduction over @xmath17 and that over @xmath4 which is studied here .",
    "the fact that the rank of the holonomy group is now greater than one means that the quiver diagram is no longer a one - dimensional chain but is a higher - dimensional lattice , of dimension two in the case of @xmath4 .",
    "we show that the condition for a vacuum state of the higgs sector of the reduced field theory can be phrased in terms of a non - abelian gauge theory on the quiver lattice .",
    "a group element associated with the higgs field can be placed on each link of the quiver diagram , and minimising the higgs potential requires that the resulting gauge field flux on the quiver lattice is zero .",
    "the higgs vacuum requires that the lattice gauge field is gauge equivalent to the trivial gauge potential .",
    "another difference is associated with spinors on @xmath4 and the treatment of the fermionic field theory .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath4 does not admit a spin structure , as there is a global obstruction to putting spinors on @xmath4 associated with the fact that its second stiefel - whitney class is non - trivial  @xcite .",
    "however , since the equivariant dimensional reduction scheme necessarily induces topologically non - trivial monopole and instanton fields on the internal space , the reduction itself provides a solution to the problem of absence of spin structure on @xmath4 by simply coupling spinor fields to non - trivial gauge backgrounds and using spin@xmath6 structures for line bundles or non - abelian spin@xmath6 structures for higher rank bundles .",
    "gauge fields on @xmath4 and their coupling to spinors were studied in @xcite .",
    "we will find that there is a unique spin@xmath6 structure accommodating the background gauge fields on @xmath4 which generically lead to yukawa interactions after dimensional reduction , in contrast to the @xmath17 reductions , whereas other choices of twisting can produce more realistic generations of fermions .",
    "altogether , we will explicitly display models in which the quantum number assignments for the fermions are qualitatively similar to those of quarks and leptons in the standard model .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in  [ dimred ]",
    "we describe the kinematics of equivariant dimensional reduction over @xmath4 , particularly how the gauge and higgs fields in the reduced field theory depend on representation theory and the various irreducible @xmath19 representations that can arise from a given @xmath20 representation , as well as the harmonic expansion of zero mode spinors . in  [ eqgaugeth ] we derive the dimensionally reduced action , showing how the higgs potential depends on the group representation content and how yukawa couplings are induced in the dirac action .",
    "some examples are studied in detail in the ensuing two sections , one class of examples based on the fundamental representation of @xmath0 in  [ fundamental ] and one class based on the adjoint representation in  [ adjoint ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in  [ conclusions ] .",

    "<S> we describe the structure of the vacuum states of quiver gauge theories obtained via dimensional reduction over homogeneous spaces , in the explicit example of @xmath0-equivariant dimensional reduction of yang - mills - dirac theory on manifolds of the form @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> the criterion for a ground state of the higgs potential can be written as the vanishing of a non - abelian yang - mills flux on the quiver diagram , regarded as a lattice with group elements attached to the links . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of @xmath0-symmetric fermions yields dirac fermions on @xmath5 transforming under the low - energy gauge group with yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the fermionic zero modes on @xmath4 yield exactly massless chiral fermions on @xmath5 , though there is a unique choice of spin@xmath6 structure on @xmath4 for which some of the zero modes can acquire masses through yukawa interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we work out the spontaneous symmetry breaking patterns and determine the complete physical particle spectrum in a number of explicit examples , some of which possess quantum number assignments qualitatively analogous to the manner in which vector bosons , quarks and leptons acquire masses in the standard model .    </S>",
