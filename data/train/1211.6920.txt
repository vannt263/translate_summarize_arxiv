    "hamamoto @xcite has studied how the single - particle energies change from bound to resonant levels when the depth of the potential is varied .",

    "hamamoto @xcite has performed a systematic research on the resonances of deformed nuclei by the multichannel scattering approach , which includes the evolution of shell structure for exotic nuclei . however , as we know , csm has not been used to investigate the resonances of deformed nuclei . due to the great success of csm in describing the resonances for a spherical system , in this paper , we extend csm to a deformed system , and examine its applicability and efficiency for the resonances of deformed nuclei .",
    "our purpose is to extend the csm to describe the resonances of deformed nuclei .",
    "this scheme has a certain advantage , i.e. , the bound and resonant states can be treated on the same footing , because the complex scaled functions for the resonant states are square integrable just like those for the bound states @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we start our scenario with the single - particle hamiltonian give as @xmath1where @xmath2 is introduced with the axially symmetric quadruple - deformed potential consisting of the following three parts : @xmath3here @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the parameter @xmath6 is the reduced compton wavelength of nucleon @xmath7 .",

    "the parity @xmath24 and the projection of the total angular momentum along the symmetry axis @xmath25 are good quantum numbers ; @xmath15 can be expanded as @xmath26where @xmath27 and the sum @xmath28 runs over the quantum numbers @xmath29and @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath42 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the solutions of the complex scaling equation ( [ complexeq ] ) can be obtained by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath21 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath21 representing bound states or resonant states do not change with @xmath52 , while the eigenvalues representing the continuous spectrum rotate with @xmath52 .",
    "the former are associated with resonance complex energies @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the resonance position and @xmath55 is its width .",
    "with the theoretical formalism , we explore the resonant states for the realistic physical system . in the numerical details ,",
    "the complex - scaled schrdinger equation is solved by expansion in the ho basis with @xmath56 oscillator shells .",
    "the oscillator frequency of the ho basis is fixed as @xmath57 mev . for the comparison with the results from the multichannel scattering approach @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0ne is taken as an example .",
    "the corresponding parameters are chosen to be same as those in ref.@xcite , i.e. , @xmath58 fm , @xmath59 mev , @xmath60 , and the nuclear radius @xmath61 varying with the mass number @xmath62 of the system with @xmath63 where @xmath64 fm is used . to achieve the information on the resonant states , we diagonalize @xmath21 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath21 for these states with the quantum numbers varying from @xmath65 to @xmath66 are plotted in fig.1 , where the rotation angle @xmath67 and the quadruple deformation @xmath68 are adopted .",
    "all the eigenvalues of @xmath21 , which correspond to the bound , the resonant , and the continuum , are respectively labeled as open squares , red open circles , and open circles .",
    "the solid line marks the position of the continuum with the rotation angle @xmath23 . from fig.1",
    ", one sees clearly that the eigenvalues of @xmath21 fall into three regions : the bound states populate on the negative energy axis , while the continuous spectrum of @xmath21 rotates clockwise with the angle @xmath23 , and resonances in the lower half of the complex energy plane located in the sector bound by the new rotated cut line and the positive energy axis get exposed and become isolated . in realistic calculations , because the finite basis is used , the continuous spectrum of @xmath21 consists of a string of points .",
    "next , we demonstrate how the resonant states become exposed by complex rotation .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath21 with @xmath69and @xmath70 are respectively displayed in figs.2(a)-2(d ) , where the other parameters are the same as those in fig.1 . from fig.2",
    "one can see that , when @xmath71 , the resonances still have not been completely separated from the continuum , and to identify the resonances in the continuum is still relatively difficult although several points are marked as the resonances in the complex energy plane . when the rotation angle is added to @xmath72 , the resonant states are clearly isolated from the continuum and distinguishing the resonances from the continuum becomes easy .",
    "when the rotation angle is added to @xmath73 , the resonant states are completely separated from the continuum , and clearly exposed in the complex energy plane .",
    "this is because the continuous spectrum of @xmath21 rotates clockwise with @xmath74 , while the resonances are almost independent of the rotation angle @xmath52 . from figs.2(c ) and 2(d ) , the rotation angle is incresed from @xmath73 to @xmath75 , and the change of position of the resonant states in the complex energy plane is almost not observable .",
    "this indicates that the resonant states can be unambiguously determined at the same time as long as the rotation angle is chosen to be large enough , which is one of the advantages of csm . in the present calculations , the exposure of the resonant states relies on the scale of the rotation angle , while their position in the complex energy plane remains almost unchanged with the variation of @xmath52 ; i.e. , the energies and widths are nearly @xmath52 independent , which also reflects that the stability of the results with respect to the variation of @xmath52 is considerably satisfactory .",
    "as we look forward to the resonances of the deformed nuclei states , it is interesting to observe the movement of the resonant states in the position with deformation in the complex energy plane , which is helpful to recognize intuitively the resonances of the deformed nuclei . in fig.3",
    ", we show the eigenvalues of @xmath21 with deformation @xmath76and @xmath77 .",
    "the other parameters are the same as those in fig.1 .",
    "when the system is spherically symmetrical ( @xmath78 ) , only three resonances are observed , which correspond respectively to the resonant states @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . when the spherical symmetry of the system is broken ( @xmath81 ) ,",
    "the 3 resonances are broken down into 12 resonances , which correspond respectively to the resonant states 1/2[330 ] , 3/2[321 ] , 5/2[312 ] , 7/2[303 ] , 1/2[310 ] , 3/2[301 ] , 5/2[303 ] , 1/2[440 ] , 3/2[431 ] , 5/2[422 ] , 7/2[413 ] , and 9/2[404 ] ( denoted with the asymptotic quantum numbers @xmath82)$ ] .",
    "the location of the 12 resonant states in the complex energy plane appears to be a significant movement when the deformation is changed . with the development of deformation towards the direction of larger deformation ,",
    "the 12 resonant states in the position are more clearly separated .",
    "the similar movement of the position towards the prolate shapes has also been obtained , and not been displayed here .",
    "although the resonances of several points of deformation are displayed in fig.3 , the resonance parameters of these points have not been fully determined for the resonant states exposed in fig.1 . in the following ,",
    "we check how the results depend on @xmath52 in the present calculations in order to present the accurate values of the resonance parameters .",
    "according to the mathematical theorem the resonance energies should be independent of @xmath52 ( for large enough @xmath52 ) .",
    "however , in the present numerical approximation , resonance parameters are dependent slightly on @xmath52 due to basis expansion with finite shells , there will be no eigenvector that is completely independent of @xmath52 .",
    "the resonance energies will move along trajectories in the complex energy plane as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "the best estimate for a resonance energy is given by the parameter @xmath52 value for which the rate of change with respect to @xmath52 is minimal .",
    "to locate the minimal rate point , we perform repeated diagonalizations of the eigenvalue problem of @xmath21 with different @xmath52 values in every deformation concerned .",
    "the illustrated results are shown in fig.4 for the resonant state 7/2[303 ] of the deformation point @xmath83 , where @xmath84 represents the number of oscillator shells of the basis . from fig.4",
    "one sees clearly that , for different @xmath84 , the dependence of the resonance parameters on @xmath52 shows a different trajectory , and the range of the trajectory becomes smaller with the increasing @xmath84 when @xmath85 . in every @xmath52-trajectory , there exists a point corresponding to the minimal rate of change of the resonance parameters with respect to @xmath52 , which presents the optimal value of the resonance parameters . despite the difference in the @xmath52 trajectory , the optimal value of the resonance parameters tends to the same result with the increasing @xmath84 , especially when @xmath85 .",
    "although the movement of the optimal value in the complex energy surface is observable , that is because we display these results in a small energy scale .",
    "compared with the continuous spectra , the movement is negligible , especially when @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the size of the basis being chosen as @xmath86 is good enough in the previous calculations .",
    "to more accurately determine the value of the resonance parameters , a close up of the @xmath52 trajectory is plotted in fig.5 for @xmath86 . in the vicinity of @xmath87 , the resonance parameters are almost independent of @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath88 , which presents the optimal value of the resonance parameters .    by using the @xmath52 trajectory ,",
    "the resonance parameters of any deformation point can be determined for the resonant states exposed in fig.1 .",
    "in fig.6 , we show the evolution of the single - particle energy with the deformation @xmath89 for the bound and resonant states . in comparison with ref.@xcite ,",
    "consistent results are obtained for the bound levels and the low - lying resonant levels .",
    "in addition , several higher - lying resonant levels are also obtained in the present calculations .",
    "especially , the width is obtained for all the resonant states . in fig.7",
    ", we plot the width for the four lower - lying resonant states 1/2[330 ] , 3/2[321 ] , 5/2[312 ] , and 7/2[303 ] .",
    "for the resonant state 7/2[303 ] , the resonance energy and the width increase monotonously with the deformation varying from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "for the resonant state 5/2[312 ] , the energy and the width display an almost horizontal change with the deformation .",
    "for the resonant states 1/2[330 ] and 3/2[321 ] , with the deformation varying from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , the energy decreases monotonously , while the width shows a unusual trend .",
    "close to @xmath78 , the value of the width appears to be at a minimum , which implies the spherical shape is more stable for the two resonant states .",
    "after the minimum appears , the resonance width increases with the increasing of deformation , which means these nuclei states become even more unstable as their levels become lower . with a continued increase in deformation , the width appears to be at a maximum value .",
    "therefore , it is relatively difficult for the halo to forming in the deformation interval from @xmath78 to the position of the width appearing at a maximum value for @xmath0ne .",
    "thereafter , the resonance width decreases with the increase in deformation . when the deformation increases beyond @xmath92 , the level 1/2[330 ] becomes weakly bound .",
    "in the vicinity of @xmath83 , the levels 1/2[330 ] and 3/2[202 ] appear to be crossing . with a further increase in deformation , the energy gap between 1/2[330 ] and 3/2[202 ] gets larger and a maximum appears at @xmath93 .",
    "thus , in this deformation interval from @xmath92 to @xmath94 , the 21th neutron can occupy the weakly bound level 1/2[330 ] or 3/2[202 ] , and the halo can be formed there . the most likely position for forming a halo should be near @xmath83 .",
    "this information indicates that @xmath0ne may be a halo nucleus with deformation @xmath95 .",
    "in summary , the complex scaling method is extended to describe the resonances of deformed nuclei .",
    "a theoretical formalism is presented in which the bound and resonant states are treated on the same footing .",
    "@xmath0ne is chosen as an example ; the utility and applicability of the extended method are demonstrated .",
    "it is found that the exposure of resonant states relies on the scale of the rotation angle , while their position in the complex energy plane remains almost unchanged with the variation of @xmath52 , which reflects that the stability of the results with respect to the variation of @xmath52 is considerably satisfactory .",
    "the movement of the resonant states in the position with deformation is exhibited in complex energy plane , where it is seen that 3 degenerate resonances are separated into 12 resonances with the development of deformation towards the oblate or prolate shapes .",
    "the bound and resonant levels obtained for @xmath0ne are in agreement with those from the coupling - channel calculations , where the resonances are determined by a multichannel scattering approach . with the deformation evolution from the oblate to prolate shapes , the bound and resonant levels show a clear shell structure .",
    "especially , the width of the two lowest - lying resonant states shows a novel evolution with deformation , and supports an explanation of the deformed halo for @xmath0ne .",
