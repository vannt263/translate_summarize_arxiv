    "observations revealed a previously unknown x - ray source inside the error box whose position was consistent with the one provided later on by the interplanetary network ( ipn ) , yielding a combined rxte / ipn trapezoidal error box ( hurley et al .",
    "four days later , the asca satellite observed the rxte / ipn error box and detected four x - ray sources .",

    "one of the three sources , r#2 , following greiner et al .",

    "the 3@xmath0 upper limit to the unabsorbed rosat flux of the source a#4 , implies a factor of seven lower than the previously measured by asca .",
    "the fading observed during the asca observation could suggest that a#1 is the x - ray counterpart to the grb .",
    "however , the presence of another decaying x - ray source inside the rxte / ipn error box keeps open the association with the grb .",
