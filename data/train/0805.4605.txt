    "luminous matter in galaxies is being converted from the interstellar matter ( ism ) phase into stars via the processes of star formation ( sf ) . in turn ,",
    "young , massive stars are short lived and release energy and matter back into the ism in the form of strong stellar winds and supernova explosions , the so  called feedback processes .",
    "the detailed interactions of gas and stars are complex and it is not straight forward to predict the evolution of gas rich galaxies from any given state .",
    "the ism must meet certain conditions to allow gravitational collapse of the material and eventually to form a star .",
    "but what exactly these conditions are and how they develop remains unclear .",
    "many different models have been proposed to trigger star formation , e.g. , stochastic modes @xcite , where stars form out of gas density enhancements that are created by the random velocity structure of the gas , external triggers such a tidal interaction with companion galaxies or ram pressure effects due to the galaxy s motion through an intergalactic medium @xcite , turbulent sf @xcite where the turbulent ism creates gas density enhancements suitable for gravitational collapse , episodic sf or breathing modes @xcite where , after an initial starburst strong feedback from massive stars inhibit subsequent sf until the energy has dispersed and the gravitational pull of the galaxy accumulates material to start another episode of sf @xcite , or propagating sf where energetic feedback from massive stars compresses the surrounding gas , leading to subsequent sf events propagating away from the origin @xcite .",
    "it remains unclear what the different sf mechanisms contribute to the overall sf history ( sfh ) of galaxies and for a full understanding is indispensable to observe both , the gaseous and stellar content of galaxies .",
    "this is the goal of our project .",
    "angst ( acs nearby galaxy survey treasury , see next section ) is an ambitious program to determine the stellar content and spatially resolved sfhs in galaxies .",
    "vla - angst is a very large array ( vla ) follow - up on the angst sample to map the neutral , atomic hi  gas content at high spatial and high velocity resolution .",
    "together , these surveys will provide well - matched , rich datasets which will be used to examine sf theories .",
    "angst ( pi : j. dalcanton , @xcite ) is a large project to obtain optical imaging in two bands ( f814w , f475w ) with the high resolution capabilities of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board of _ hst_. it is a volume limited survey of all galaxies out to distances of @xmath2mpc , at galactic latitudes @xmath3 . due to their very large extent on the sky and the relatively small field of view of _ hst _ ,",
    "local group galaxies are not part of the survey .",
    "to include most of the galaxies in the nearby m81 and sculptor groups , however , cones out to 4mpc toward those regions have been added to the survey volume .",
    "angst contains 69 galaxies of all morphological types and spans a wide range of @xmath4 magnitudes in optical luminosity and @xmath5 magnitudes of sf rate .",
    "one method to derive the sfh of a galaxy is based on the luminosity function of its main sequence .",
    "every bin along the main sequence contains stellar populations of a given age but , unfortunately , it also contains younger stars which makes the interpretation less reliable and limits the look - back time to @xmath6myr .",
    "a better method to disentangle the different stellar ages is to use the blue loop of the stellar isochrones , occupied by helium burning stars  a method pioneered by @xcite .",
    "not only can a _ global _ sfh up to @xmath0myr be derived with this method but the quality of the _ hst _ observations allows to pin down stars of a given age ( time resolution up to @xmath7myr ) and it is thus possible to create _",
    "maps _ of the resolved sfh of galaxies @xcite .",
    "using the very large array in b , c , and d configuration , vla - angst maps the hi  content at high linear ( @xmath1 ) and velocity resolution ( a few kms@xmath8 ) .",
    "this is well matched to the spatial resolution that can be achieved in the construction of the resolved sfh for the angst targets .",
    "not all of the angst galaxies are observed in vla - angst .",
    "objects too far south for the vla as well as galaxies with known hi  non - detections are excluded .",
    "a few of the angst targets have already been mapped by the the hi  nearby galaxy survey ( things , pi : f. walter @xcite ) , an hi  survey with the exact same observational setup as vla - angst , and the data is shared . in total , vla - angst has an allocated time of @xmath9hours of vla time and the data collection is expected to be finished by the end of 2008 .",
    "the vla - angst sample is listed in table[tab : sample ] and histograms of the number of galaxies as functions of galaxy parameters are shown in fig.[fig : sample ] .",
    "most of the galaxies are at a distance of @xmath10mpc , where the m81 and the sculptor groups reside .",
    "the size distribution peaks at small diameters ; most galaxies exhibit rather faint absolute blue magnitudes of @xmath11mag . together with their morphological classification ( fig.[fig : sample][e ] ) it becomes obvious that the sample is dominated by gas rich dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) .",
    "this is expected for a volume limited survey , because dwarfs are the most numerous type of galaxy , and because dwarf spheroidals and ellipticals are mostly excluded from vla - angst due to the criterion to discard angst galaxies with hi  non  detections .",
    "the dominance of dirrs is not unwelcome .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : sample](f ) , most of the galaxies in our sample are rather slow rotators and are expected to be largely governed by solid body motion .",
    "shearing forces that may mix stellar populations and smear out hi  structures are therefore much less dominant and are usually found at the outskirts of dirrs .",
    "the comparison of stars and gas features are thus much more accurate and can be traced back to older populations .",

    "what are the triggers of star formation ? _ + the hi  data will be compared to maps of resolved sfh .",
    "both the distribution as well as the dynamics of the gas are expected to play key roles in defining the actual sites where star formation can occur .",
    "different star formation models ( see introduction ) lead to different properties of the gas in their relation to stellar contents and ages .",
    "sf efficiencies will be derived which may depend on the sfh of a galaxy , on its morphology , and/or on its metallicity .",
    "the high resolution of our data will be reflected in precision rotation curves , which is indispensable in understanding how shearing influences sf , and to identify regions where the galaxies spin like solid bodies .",
    "those areas are the most promising ones to test stochastic and propagating sf modes in galaxies .",
    "+ _ what is the role , efficiency , and impact of stellar feedback on the ism ? _ + with the stellar population age and mass distribution at any given position in a galaxy , the kinematic properties of the hi  gas can be used to estimate what fraction of the energy released by strong stellar winds and supernova explosions is dumped into the ism .",
    "this will also help to better understand the mechanism of expanding hisupershells , which are thought to be a signature of feedback from entire stellar clusters @xcite , but for many of the shells the search for such a cluster has failed @xcite .",
    "when regions with and without strong shear are compared , it will be possible to determine how much of the hi  turbulence is caused by external , galaxy wide dynamics and what fraction originates from more localized sf events .",
    "the energetic input from massive stars can have two very different effects , it can either compress the surrounding gas , causing it to collapse and to expedite further sf , or it can stir up the surrounding ism in a way such that sf is suppressed .",
    "our data will make it possible to derive which of the processes is more dominant .",

    "wavelength information will eventually lead to the detailed understanding of the energy balance between the different phases of the ism , e.g. , at which hi  densities and dispersions the different sf tracers appear and how this bootstraps on sf processes .",
    "in addition , the fractal properties of hi , e.g. , the fractal dimension can be studied over a large number of different galaxies with unified data quality . +",
    "_ how do galaxies evolve ? _ + gas is consumed by sf and feedback processes of massive stars are replenishing part of the ism .",
    "the knowledge of the global sfh of the galaxies in our sample will allow us to derive the hi  to stellar mass ratio as a function the cumulative sf rate over the galaxies lifetimes .",
    "even better , the spatial resolution of the sf rate maps enables us to derive variations of this ratio over the bodies of the galaxies , e.g , in the cores and the outer disks .",
    "this will provide a measure for the efficiency with which gas is turned into stars .",
    "in addition , properties of the ism will be brought in relation to the type of their hosts .",
    "large scale dynamics , e.g. , bars and density waves , will have an effect on the gas and sf properties .",
    "this influences the evolution of a galaxy as a whole and the timing between gaseous features ( via kinematics ) and stellar ages will be derived .",
    "rotation curves , which are needed for such a study and which will be a product of vla - angst , are also a gold mine to test @xmath17 cold dark matter ( @xmath17cdm ) models .",
    "the spatial resolution of the data is good enough to derive the shape of the dark matter halo down to the very cores of the galaxies .",
    "whereas theoretical @xmath17cdm models predict a cuspy profile , observations so far show a flat density distribution in contradiction to @xmath17cdm @xcite .",
    "the vla - angst survey , in particular combined with the things and little things surveys will provide a large , high spatial and velocity resolution database of hi  in galaxies with very similar data quality .",
    "@xmath17cdm tests on the shape of dark matter density profiles will therefore have the excellent statistics of a 100 + nearby galaxy sample .",
    "at this moment in time , a large number of interferometric hi  surveys of nearby galaxies are underway or have just been finished . in the south ,",
    "the `` local volume hi  survey '' ( lvhis , pi : b. koribalski ) is covering all galaxies with hi  out to @xmath4mpc , with a spatial resolution of @xmath18 , the highest economically feasible resolution of the australia telescope compact array . in the northern hemisphere",
    ", there is the giant meterwave radio telescope `` faint irregular galaxies gmrt survey '' ( figgs , pi : a. begum ) as well as three major high resolution ( @xmath19 ) vla hi  surveys , things ( `` the hi  nearby galaxies survey '' , pi : f. walter ) , vla  angst ( pi : j. ott ) , and little things ( pi : d. hunter ) , ongoing or have recently been completed .",
    "all of the three vla surveys are designed to provide data very similar in spatial resolution ( vla b , c , and d array configurations ) , velocity resolution ( a few kms@xmath8 ) , and sensitivity ( hi  column density limit @xmath20@xmath21 ) .",
    "in addition , the data reduction of the three surveys will be very similar .",
    "this will provide almost equally high fidelity imaging for a total of more than a hundred galaxies .",
    "extragalactic high resolution hi  studies will therefore enter a new era with statistically meaningful results . together with surveys at other wavelengths that are currently underway ( angst , lvl , 11hugs , sting , etc . ) , we will have all the tracers at hand to understand the interplay of gas and stars on scales of galaxies and galaxy groups",
