    "galaxy evolution is a fundamental process in the universe .",
    "it includes the star formation ( sf ) mechanisms and accounts for evolutionary histories of single galaxies as well as for overall environmental effects of galaxies on the structure and evolution of the universe .",
    "the global cosmological structure , and the sf processes in individual galaxies , affect each other .",
    "stellar evolution in galaxies enriches the heavy element abundances and modifies the radiation field , affecting future sf in the same galaxy and its structure .",
    "even though the sf process is fundamental , it and the different factors controlling it are not yet fully understood .",
    "thus , investigating the importance of external effects on the star formation process in galaxies contributes to the knowledge about development of galaxies and their contribution to the evolution of the universe .",
    "it is well - known that the galaxy neighbourhood affects sf .",
    "various studies pointed out the dependence of sf and of other properties on the density of galaxies in the immediate environment of a galaxy ; this is known as the `` morphology - density '' relationship of dressler ( 1980 ) . however , while the evidence is clearer on the question of cluster environment influence , the sf behavior of galaxies in low - density regions was and remains ambiguous .",
    "for example , hashimoto et al . (",
    "1998 ) showed that the sf - environment relation is rather complicated ; at similar concentration indices , the sf of galaxies in low - density regions is as strong as that of galaxies in clusters .",
    "popescu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) studied emission - line galaxies , specifically blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) and mostly dwarf galaxies .",
    "they showed that there were no specific differences between field galaxies and objects in voids in terms of the sf rate ( sfr ) and the ratio between the present sfr and the past - averaged one , and that both field and void galaxies had similar sfr surface densities .",
    "void galaxies did not exhibit lower metallicites than field galaxies , as one could expect .",
    "gomez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to study the sf - environment relation but limited themselves to field vs. cluster comparisons and to sf characterization through spectroscopy of central regions of galaxies .",
    "haines et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found significant differences in the star formation patterns of dwarf galaxies with 17.7@xmath3m@xmath419 as a function of neighbourhood ; dwarf galaxies in the inner part of a galaxy cluster , within one virial radius , were mostly old and passive , whereas those outside this distance and in lower density regions were forming stars .",
    "the earliest attempt to define a sample of isolated galaxies was by karachentseva ( 1973 ) ; her catalogue selection was based on distance and size of possible companion galaxies .",
    "this seelction criterion was refined in further years , including automatic sample selection from the sdss ( e.g. , allam et al . 2005 ) .",
    "an interest in `` isolated '' galaxies was also expressed in 1977 by huchra & thuan ( 1977 ) .",
    "the 12 objects selected there were observed by brosch et al .",
    "( 1982a , 1982b , 1984a , 1984b ) in a range of spectral domains and the observations were summarized in a phd thesis ( brosch 1983 ) with the conclusion that isolated objects show abnormal sf patterns .",
    "the difference between isolated and other galaxies lies in the possibility that other galaxies in the vicinity of an object might trigger or influence its sf .",
    "such influences include galaxy harassment , disruption due to tidal interactions , outright collisions , etc . at this point",
    "it is necessary to distinguish between a primary , or intrinsic , sf trigger and any number of external triggers .",
    "a primary sf trigger should not require external activation and could operate in isolated galaxies , whereas most of the time , a tidal interaction with another galaxy ( especially in dwarf galaxies where these tidal effects are low ) would probably not be sufficient to trigger an sf event in a relatively isolated galaxy ( see also kunth & stlin 2000 ) .",
    "various papers studied bcgs and their sf ; for example , kong ( 2003 , 2004 , and previous papers referenced therein ) investigated a large sample of bcgs with respect to their evolution histories , stellar populations , gas content and observed spectra .",
    "pustilnik et al .",
    "( 2001a , b ) studied the influence of environment on sf in bcgs near other galaxies , and found that the sf in at least @xmath5 of them could have been triggered by tidal interactions or mergers , whereas about @xmath6 of the isolated bcgs were probably tidally influenced by dwarf galaxies in their vicinity .",
    "the influence of the environment was studied also by balogh et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who found higher sf in objects located in low galaxy density environments .",
    "ceccarelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that galaxies in void walls are bluer and have more sf that galaxies elsewhere .",
    "pustilnik et al . ( 2002 ) investigated the hi properties of a sample of bcg galaxies located in very low density environments .",
    "the sample comprised 26 objects from the second byurakan ( sbs ) and case surveys located in voids with v@xmath7 km s@xmath2 , two bcgs in the void behind the virgo cluster and 11 bcgs in denser environments .",
    "they found that at the same blue luminosity , and for m@xmath8 - 18.0 mag , bcgs in lower density environment had on average more hi .",
    "brosch et al .",
    "( 2004 ) examined the possibility that the sf in dwarf irregular galaxies ( digs ) or blue compact ( bcg ) galaxies is triggered by tidal interactions with other nearby galaxies by searching for star - forming companion galaxies in a large ( n=96 ) composite sample of digs imaged in h@xmath0 .",
    "the lack of such companions for most of the sample galaxies , along with other supporting evidence , indicates that triggering by external interactions is unlikely to be a primary sf influence for these bcgs .",
    "we aim here to study the sf properties of another sample of galaxies known _ a - priori _ to be located in extremely low galaxy density region , by concentrating in a study of volumes located in the direction of known cosmic voids .",
    "the definition as to what exactly makes a certain volume a `` void '' is debatable since , a - priori , a void in the galaxy distribution should be completely empty of galaxies ( see e.g. , lindner et al .",
    "the cosmic voids identified in studies of the large - scale structure are not completely empty of galaxies , but the object density there is extremely low , with a density contrast @xmath9 , and showing even zero galaxy density at the centers of voids as revealed by the 2df survey ( hoyle & vogeley 2004 ) .",
    "hoyle et al .",
    "( 2005 ) defined a void as a region with a galaxy density contrast @xmath100.6 over a distance scale of 7 mpc . using @xmath111000 sdss objects",
    ", they found the void galaxies to be typically fainter than those in the `` wall '' bordering the void .",
    "while hoyle et al . did not find an excess of dwarf galaxies ( dgs ) in the voids , they claimed that the void population is dominated by late - type objects .",
    "the same sample was studied spectroscopically by rojas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who found that void objects tend to have higher specific sfrs ( sfr per unit stellar mass ) than wall galaxies .",
    "their stellar populations were also younger than for wall galaxies .",
    "studies of the galaxy distribution in voids showed that the degree of isolation is sensitive to the limiting - magnitude of the observation ( e.g. , lindner et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of normal galaxies consists of a structure of clusters , super - clusters , filaments and sheets of galaxies . in - between this structure",
    "there are large voids with very low galaxy density ( lindner et al .",
    "lindner et al . ( 1997 ) tested the spatial distribution of bcg and concluded that the galaxy distribution in voids is hierarchical , e.g. , the void boundaries are sensitive to the limiting magnitude of the sample .",
    "they found that the faint galaxies in voids are concentred toward the void boundaries , with a small fraction of the population at the center of the voids .",
    "this fraction of faint galaxies within the voids are grouped in systems lacking a bright galaxy .",
    "lindner et al . concluded that the bcg spatial distribution is similar to that of normal dwarf galaxies , with a median distance from a normal galaxy of 0.7h@xmath2mpc .",
    "galaxies in voids were specifically targeted in the previous studies of e.g. , weistrop et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , popescu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , huchtmeier et al .",

    "spectroscopy of 26 galaxies in the bootes void was reported by cruzen et al .",
    "zitrin & brosch ( 2008 ) identified a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies that trace a @xmath110.5 mpc linear structure in a nearby void .",
    "interestingly , all the objects in this linear structure show low - level star formation .",
    "a possible interpretation is that the sf takes place because of the accretion of intergalactic gas onto a dark matter filament .",
    "current @xmath12cdm simulations predict that low - amplitude filamentary structures criss - cross the voids ( peebles 2007 ) .    to evaluate the influence of `` isolation '' on the sf history of a galaxy we selected a sample of galaxies that appeared to be extremely isolated and possibly located in voids .",
    "section 2 describes the sample selection .",
    "the galaxies were observed through r - band and rest - frame h@xmath0 filters with the wise observatory 1 m telescope and the observations are described in  3 .",
    "the observations were supplemented by data collected from the literature , mainly from ned , from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "the analysis and results are described in  4 along with the evolutionary models used to evaluate the star formation histories .",
    "the results are discussed in  5 along with a comparison with other star - forming galaxies studied by our group in a cluster environment .",
    "different aspects must be taken into consideration in the selection of a sample of galaxies to test star forming processes .",
    "the sample selection should simplify as much as possible the theoretical factors that affect the process .",
    "on the other hand , practical aspects of conducting the necessary observations , and the amount of time the observations will require , are also important considerations .",
    "we chose a sample of galaxies that are relatively compact and exhibit intense sf activity , as indicated by the presence of strong emission lines in their spectra and by blue colours . since our main goal was to investigate the influence of neighbour interaction on the process of sf , we selected galaxies that seemed to lack known luminous objects in their neighbourhoods .",
    "blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) with strong emission lines are a good selection for this study , since a strong h@xmath0 emission line is expected in case of recent sf in a gas - rich object .",
    "bcgs are known to have bluer colours [ ( u - b)@xmath11 - 0.6 ; ( b - v)=0.00.3 ] than ordinary irregular galaxies and their surface brightness is much higher ( kunth 1995 ) .",
    "spectroscopically , in such objects the ratio of [ o iii]@xmath135007 to h@xmath14 is approximately 5 due to the presence of ob star complexes , indicating a very recent burst of star formation ( kunth 1995 ) .",
    "they are chemically less evolved galactic systems .",
    "although such galaxies were originally regarded as newly formed or primeval galaxies , spectroscopic evidence from large samples of bcgs shows that underneath their bright and blue stellar components lies , in most cases , an older population of stars , indicating previous short star formation episodes ( e.g. , telles & terlevich 1995 ; kong 2003 , 2004 ) . even in sbs 0335 - 052w , considered to be a young , recently formed galaxy , izotov , thuan & guseva ( 2005 ) found a stellar population a few 100 myrs old .",
    "these properties indicate that bcg galaxies are good candidates for our study , enabling efficient observations with a 1 m telescope even for relatively faint galaxies .",
    "the compactness of these galaxies favours this study , since the surface brightness of the galaxies is high and the detected signal is strong relative to detector noise and background sky brightness .    since our primary goal is to understand the role of the lack of frequent interactions in the regulation of the sf , we explain first how likely are interactions among very isolated galaxies .",
    "the chance of a galaxy - galaxy interaction can be estimated from the cross - section presented by a galaxy to a potential intruder that could cause a star burst . in what follows",
    "we disregard the expansion of the universe ; in the past the galaxies were much closer together enhancing the interaction chance . from the arguments presented above , the impact parameter @xmath15 for a successful sf - triggering interaction must be 25 - 50 kpc .",
    "disregarding gravitational focusing , the number of past interactions a galaxy experiences during a time span @xmath16 is therefore @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the peculiar velocity of the target galaxy relative to its immediate galaxy neighbourhood and @xmath19 is the space density of galaxies in the same neighbourhood .",
    "this number of expected interactions during a hubble time can therefore be written as : @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the age of the universe .",
    "given the low velocity dispersion of galaxies in the field , and the very low galaxy density in the vicinity of the sample galaxies , the chance of a relatively recent interaction that could have triggered sf in the objects of our sample appears very remote . specifically , typical values of v@xmath22200 km s@xmath2 , r=50 kpc , and n@xmath23 mpc@xmath24 , yield n@xmath25 , imply a single sf - triggering interaction every 1000 hubble times .",
    "we also note the remark of di matteo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that strong starbursts are rare even among major galaxy interactions or mergers .",
    "the sample selection was aimed to minimize the chance that an interaction with another galaxy could have triggered the detected star formation .",
    "requiring that the distance from any other such galaxy be larger than a given value minimizes this possibility .",
    "a galaxy - galaxy interaction has to be fairly recent to trigger an sf event .",
    "icke ( 1985 ) performed numerical hydrodynamical simulations investigating the fate of a gas disk perturbed by a hyperbolic encounter with an intruder galaxy .",
    "he showed that relatively slow , pro - grade and in - plane encounters can shock the disk gas and can , in principle , cause star formation .",
    "struck - marcel & scalo ( 1987 ) estimated a maximal time delay between a tidal interaction and a subsequent sf event of @xmath26 years , commensurate with the rotation period of a disk galaxy .",
    "however , the tidal triggering sf models of barton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are consistent with their observations only for delays shorter than @xmath27 years .",
    "galaxies that appear extremely isolated , sometimes located in central regions of voids , may really be the brighter examples of concentrations of star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is possible that sf in a seemingly isolated galaxy could be triggered by an interaction with a dwarf galaxy that is much fainter than the detection limits .",
    "one example of a dwarf irregular companion triggering sf in a void galaxy , hs 0822 + 3542 , was suggested by pustilnik et al .",
    "the primary object is at least 3 mpc distant from l@xmath28 galaxies but it does show signs of a recent ( @xmath1110 myr ) star burst and it has a very faint and blue companion that could be related to the starburst .",
    "other possible neighbours , fainter than l@xmath28 , are dwarf galaxies at 1.15 to 1.42 mpc projected distance . in this case , the projected distance between the primary galaxy and its faint companion is only 11.4 kpc and their recession velocity difference is smaller than 25 km sec@xmath2 .",
    "this system is similar to the extragalactic hii regions reported by shaver & chen ( 1985 ) in that two seemingly dwarf galaxies show simultaneous star formation bursts , and to the sbs 0335 - 052 system ( ekta et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "brosch , bar - or and malka ( 2006 ) discovered small groups of uncatalogued , compact , star forming dgs by h@xmath0 mapping of the neighbourhoods of apparently isolated , catalogued , star - forming dgs .",
    "their sample consists of dwarf ( m@xmath2918 mag ) galaxies at least 2 mpc away from any other catalogued galaxy .",
    "the objects they selected as extremely isolated are conceivably the brightest members of sparse groups of dwarf galaxies that are presently forming stars .",
    "an h@xmath0 emission knot was identified by brosch et al .",
    "( 2007 ) at a projected distance of 78\"@xmath2263 kpc from the galaxy am1934 - 567 .",
    "other very compact and h@xmath0-emitting `` dots '' near other galaxies were reported by kellar ( 2008 ) and kellar et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , albeit generally at much closer distances from a galaxy than the objects in brosch et al .",
    "( 2006).these findings imply that it is possible to find `` associated '' star - forming objects even in very sparse environments .",
    "we constructed a sample of galaxies that a - priori meets extreme isolation criteria , based primarily on the studies of lindner et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "the sample consists mainly of galaxies selected from the second byurakan survey ( sbs ; stepanian 2005 and references therein ) , an objective - prism emission - line galaxy survey in the sky region bordered by 7@xmath3040@xmath3117@xmath3020@xmath32 and 49@xmath3361@xmath34 , supplemented by galaxies from the case survey ( pesch & sanduleak 1983 et seq .",
    ", salzer et al . 1995 ) in the same right ascension range .",
    "these objects were in the direction of identified giant voids in the galaxy distribution , and their redshifts matched those of the voids .",
    "for these reasons we refer here to the sample galaxies as being either `` isolated '' or `` void '' galaxies .",
    "the sample was originally chosen so that each object should have no ned objects within a projected distance @xmath35d @xmath33 mpc ( h=0.73 ) and within a redshift difference @xmath36300 km sec@xmath2 .",
    "the addition of redshifts to the public data sets in subsequent years ( e.g. , from new sdss data releases ) reduced the degree of isolation of the sample .",
    "for example , a current query of close neighbours ( @xmath35d @xmath37 mpc , @xmath38 km sec@xmath2 , and @xmath39 mag ) in sdss , or similarly in ned , reveals several neighbouring galaxies as detailed in table [ sample ] .",
    "thus , some galaxies that appeared originally to be very isolated became somewhat less isolated .",
    "however , these galaxies are still located on the outskirts of galaxy filaments in the bright galaxy distribution , as can be seen when plotting the location of each object on the wedge diagrams in fig . 3 of lindner et al .",
    "our decision to choose our sample primarily from the sbs and the case ( cg ) catalogs ensures that the galaxies are blue and compact , but have strong emission lines , since they were originally detected in objective - prism surveys .",
    "a few objects are also iras or first sources , and many have been observed in sdss or other programs .",
    "the sample galaxies are shown in table [ sample ] , which lists a running number for each sample object , its leading designation , and its j2000 coordinates and radial velocity from ned .",
    "since ned is a dynamic compilation , changes can occur at any time ; one of our objects ( sbs1229 + 579 ) was included in the original sample with a redshift of 7360 km sec@xmath2 and h@xmath0 observations were performed accordingly .",
    "later , the redshift was revised in ned to 16537 km / sec ; this is way outside the range covered by the h@xmath0 filter used for this observation , and in fact out of the range of any of the wise observatory ( wo ) h@xmath0 filters , and explains why we did not detect h@xmath0 line emission from this object .",
    "the table also lists n@xmath40 , the number of ned companions found in the search volume ( 3 mpc with h@xmath41=73 km sec@xmath2 and 300 km sec@xmath2 , as listed in the last checking of ned in december 2008 ) .",
    "this indicates that the objects are in regions where the galaxy density changes from 8.8@xmath4210@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 to 0.13 mpc@xmath24 and using the estimate for the number of encounters during a hubble time from eq .",

    "12 was shown to be a binary galaxy , with two bcg components separated by 48 kpc ( pustilnik et al .",
    "2002 ) , measured separately by us .",
    "object no .",
    "4 shows two h@xmath0-emitting regions , but was measured as a whole .",
    "the models were calculated with respect to the total flux from each galaxy entry in the table .",
    "the current sfr and the simplified sfh of the sample galaxies are presented in table [ models ] .",
    "most galaxies show present sfrs of @xmath43 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( median value ) , while a few show a higher sfr of several @xmath44 yr@xmath2 .",
    "typical bcg sfrs were examined before ; usually , median sfrs are @xmath45 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 up to several m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 .",
    "kong ( 2004 ) summarized previous work and discussed differences caused by different sfr indicators .",
    "for example , the median sfr in his 72 heterogeneous bcg sample was @xmath112.3 @xmath44 yr@xmath2 , using an h@xmath0 indicator .",
    "kong used also other sfr indicators and found that not correcting for internal extinction and for the underlying stellar populations would underestimate the sfr .",
    "in order to compare the result obtained here to those of kong we recalculated the median sfr of kong s sample , excluding galaxies much brighter or much fainter than those present in our sample ( i.e. , excluding galaxies with m@xmath46 or m@xmath47 @xmath48 ) .",
    "this yields a median sfr of @xmath111 @xmath44 yr@xmath2 , which is only slightly higher than ours probably due to the fact that we did not correct for internal extinction .",
    "a more interesting result is obtained when examining the galaxy stellar compositions and sf histories .",
    "sfhs of bcg have also been examined before and a common belief is that old stellar populations , of one to a few gyr , are present along the newly formed stars .",
    "the sf in such galaxies is believed to take place in short bursts separated by long quiescent periods ( kong 2003 , kong et al .",
    "such a behaviour , of series of short sf bursts , was simulated by e.g. valcke et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for isolated dwarf galaxies . however , we find that the observed colours are better fitted when the stellar population is explained by a combination of a continuous , constant sfr and a more recent instantaneous burst . as table [ models ] shows , the calculated burst times correspond to these assumptions , since most galaxies had their first sf process beginning several gyr ago , whereas almost all galaxies show in addition a much recent burst .",
    "table [ models ] shows that the simple - minded algorithm used here to evaluate the sfhs of the sample galaxies does sometimes produce unexpected results .",
    "an example is the model result for galaxies no .",
    "7 , 14 , 22 and 27 . there",
    ", no recent burst is fit by the models , and the galaxy colours are well explained by a constant sfr , which started @xmath49gyr ago . moreover , for all the sample galaxies the observed light is dominated ( @xmath50% ) by the constant sfr , and only a small fraction ( usually up to @xmath51% ) is contributed by the recent burst .",
    "we mentioned above the claim of pustilnik et al .",
    "( 2001a ) that in at least @xmath5 of bcgs the sf could have been triggered by tidal interactions or mergers , whereas about @xmath6 of the isolated bcgs are probably tidally influenced by dwarf galaxies in their vicinity .",
    "we did not identify obvious interactors that could have triggered sf in the `` isolated '' galaxies of our sample .",
    "this emphasizes that interactions may not be the primary triggers of sf in isolated galaxies .",
    "we checked this by plotting the sfr from column 4 in table  4 against the number of nearest neighbours n@xmath40 from column 6 of table  1 .",
    "there is no correlation between the two ( r@xmath52=0.04 ) , which shows that a slight increase of the galaxy density in the neighbourhood of an object does not significantly encourage the sf .",
    "essentially , we find no sfr differences between objects in extremely underdense environments , such as the two components of sbs1120 + 586 , and e.g. , g0957 + 3503 the galaxy in the densest environment of our sample that has 15 ned - listed neighbours within 3 mpc and 300 km sec@xmath2 .",
    "another interesting comparison is with the sfrs of late - type dwarf galaxies ( ltdgs ) in the virgo cluster ( almoznino & brosch 1998a , b ; heller et al .",
    "the ltdgs are galaxies devoid of large - scale internal sf triggers such as spiral density waves .",
    "they are a legitimate comparison sample to the bcgs studied here , since these objects were measured in the same way as the galaxies studied here , with the same telescope and filters , and their sfrs were calculated with exactly the same method as used here .",
    "as the comparison sample consists of galaxies that are members of the virgo cluster , their n@xmath40 values are at least two orders of magnitude higher than for the bcgs studied here . however , since the initial selection specified low surface brightness , it is to be expected that the ltdgs would show also low sfr values compared with those of the bcg sample studied here .",
    "we find that the bcgs studied here have sfrs higher by two - three orders of magnitude than those of the virgo late - type dwarfs , despite their being relatively isolated .",
    "part of the difference can be attributed to the intrinsic brightness of the galaxies .",
    "the bcgs are also significantly brighter than the bcds and lsb irr s studied by almoznino & brosch ( 1998a , b ) and by heller et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , although about half of the objects included in the present sample do qualify as dwarfs ( m@xmath2918 mag ) .",
    "these are plotted in figure 1 , which shows m@xmath53 from column 2 of table 4 against log(sfr ) .",
    "the virgo dwarfs were plotted in figure 1 by assuming that all are at the same distance as the cluster , 18 mpc , as adopted in our previous papers .",
    "the correlation between the total starlight and h@xmath0 is well known .",
    "gavazzi & scodeggio ( 1996 ) found that galaxy colours interpreted as the age of the stellar population correlate with the h - band luminosity ; the h - band luminosity was assumed to measure the stellar mass of a galaxy while bluer colours indicate younger stellar populations .",
    "frick et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found a similar relation for hii regions in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 6946 and heller et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed this for dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "kong ( 2004 ) found that the sfr correlated with m@xmath53 for the bcgs in his sample . the relation he found : @xmath54 fits also the points plotted by us , although the low - sfr virgo dwarfs deviate below the relation .",
    "the virgo dwarfs extend kong s relation by two orders of magnitude , down to sfr@xmath55 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 . the bcgs studied here form more stars * because * they have more stars to begin with , and their extreme isolated location does not influence significantly their sf properties when compared to dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "this property , that the sfr correlates with the stellar light ( or the stellar mass ) is known also for high - redshift galaxy samples ( e.g. , noeske et al .",
    "2007 ; elbaz et al . 2007 ; daddi et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we showed above that , although the bcgs studied here are not absolutely isolated in that some may have a few neighbours within 300 km sec@xmath2 and 3 mpc , they reside in regions of very low galaxy densities .",
    "we found that all are forming stars at the present time and that their sfrs are higher than those of virgo cluster dwarfs , but not exceedingly higher .",
    "being both compact and relatively isolated , no external triggers seem to have encouraged sf in these galaxies and the primary sf trigger is probably an internal one , such as accretion of gas retained in their dm halos .",
    "this trigger could be encouraged by tidal interactions , but is evidently active even in the absence of such interactions .",
    "we studied the star formation properties and histories of galaxies in a sample of bcg galaxies located in voids or in void walls , selected to be as isolated as possible , in order to minimize the chance that external effects influenced the formation and evolution of these objects .",
    "bcgs are known to have an older population underlying the recently formed stars , usually explained as formed by several instantaneous sf bursts separated by long quiescent periods .",
    "our stellar population analysis confirms the presence of a significant older population .",
    "we found that for practically all the galaxies a combination of a constant sfr combined with a recent instantaneous sf burst is a better explanation of the integrated stellar population .",

    "<S> we report h@xmath0 observations of a sample of very isolated blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) located in the direction of large cosmic voids obtained to understand their stellar population compositions , the present star formation ( sf ) properties , and their star formation histories ( sfhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> our observations were combined with photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and near - infrared data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , wherever such data were available . </S>",
    "<S> the combined data sets were compared with predictions of evolutionary synthesis models by bruzual & charlot ( 2003a , 2003b ) . </S>",
    "<S> current star formation rates ( sfrs ) were determined from the h@xmath0 measurements , and simplified star formation histories were derived from broad - band and h@xmath0 photometry and comparisons with the models .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that the star formation rates range within 0.11.0 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 , with a median rate of 0.6 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed galaxy colours are better explained by the combination of a continuous sf process with a recent instantaneous sf burst , than by a combination of several instantaneous bursts , as has been suggested previously . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results for the star formation rate of the sample galaxies with that of samples of dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster and find that the bcgs have significantly stronger sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> the bcgs follow the correlation between h@xmath0 emission and starlight found for dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster and for other bcgs . </S>"
