    "semileptonic decays of heavy - light mesons play a central role in the study of flavour physics both on the experimental and theoretical sides . the extraction of the cabibbo  kobayashi",

    "a non - perturbative estimate of the matrix elements can be obtained by lattice qcd .",
    "furthermore , within the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) it has been shown  @xcite that the semileptonic transitions between heavy - light mesons can be parametrized , at leading order of the expansion in the inverse heavy quark mass , in terms of a universal form factor known as isgur - wise function .",
    "the isgur - wise function is universal in the sense that it describes any semileptonic decay mediated by heavy - heavy weak currents regardless of the flavour of the initial and final heavy quarks and of the spins of the mesons . from the phenomenological point of view",
    "it is relevant to know the size of the corrections to the isgur - wise limit and to establish at which order the heavy quark expansion has to be truncated to produce useful results down to the charm mass .",
    "matrix elements of the vector heavy - heavy currents between pseudoscalar meson states are parametrized in terms of two form factors . in the case of the light leptons @xmath3 ,",
    "the differential decay rate of the process @xmath4 is proportional to the square of a particular linear combination of the two , @xmath5 .",
    "the babar and belle collaborations have already measured  @xcite the branching ratios of the processes @xmath6 and a future measurement of the differential decay rate will make possible to extract @xmath1 also from this channel . in this case",

    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have already shown our final results for @xmath5 by focusing on their phenomenological implications without giving all the details of the calculation . here",
    "we present detailed results of continuum and chiral extrapolations and separate estimates of the two independent form factors for several values of the initial and final heavy quark masses together with an analysis of the infinite heavy quark mass limit .",
    "in addition , we make a prediction for the ratio of the differential decay rates of the processes @xmath4 with @xmath7 and @xmath3 .",
    "the simulation of relativistic heavy quarks with masses ranging from the physical @xmath8 mass down to the physical @xmath9 mass has been performed by using the step scaling method ( ssm )  @xcite , already applied successfully to the determination of heavy quark masses and heavy - light meson decay constants  @xcite .",
    "the ssm allows to reconcile large quark masses with adequate lattice resolution and large physical volumes .",
    "the two form factors have been calculated for different values of the momentum transfer by making use of flavour twisted boundary conditions  @xcite , that shift the discretized set of lattice momenta by an arbitrary amount ( see also  @xcite ) .",

    "the form factors depend upon the masses of the parent and daughter particles and upon @xmath19 @xmath20 time reversal and hermiticity imply that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are real . furthermore they imply that @xmath21 is even under the interchange of the initial and final states while @xmath22 is odd , @xmath23 in eq .  ( [ eq : hphmdef ] ) one can consider the limit in which both meson masses go to infinity at fixed @xmath14-velocity ; the left hand side is well defined in this limit and , consequently , also the form factors .",

    "the form factors have been obtained with a relative accuracy of the order of a few percent allowing to establish the range of validity of the heavy quark effective theory for these quantities .",
    "in particular we have obtained a check of the predictions of the luke s theorem that we re - derived .",
    "the corrections to the static limit are very small already in the case of the elastic form factor @xmath188 and negligible in the case of @xmath189 .",
    "we have also established the accuracy of the static approximation to the form factors of the decay @xmath0 which is of the order of @xmath172-@xmath190% at zero recoil and reaches about @xmath191% at @xmath192 where becomes definitely inadequate for precise phenomenological applications ."
