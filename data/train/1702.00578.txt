    "the observation of non - integer conductance plateaus in bipolar graphene quantum hall systems has been interpreted by the equilibration of topological states at the interface , and theoretical efforts have supported experimental findings by considering disorders on the edges and interface@xcite . despite the agreement between theoretical supports and experimental measurements for small filling factor cases , there are still open questions for relatively larger filling factors  namely , the incompleteness of the equilibration and its origin .",

    "for a two - terminal geometry , conductance measurements through the bipolar junctions are attributed to either the mode - mixing between parallel - propagating states at the p - n junction interface or edge modes along the system boundary in case of n - n ( p - p ) junctions , according to the polarity of the bipolar junctions .",

    "[ fg : cleancond](c ) .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath62 , while @xmath55 exhibits typical quantum hall conductance plateaus as @xmath63 varies , the plateaus are smaller by a factor of @xmath53 since one topological channel ( correlated to the lowest lls ) is canceled out at the n - n junction interfaces ( see fig .",

    "[ fg : roughcond](a ) is equal to the mean of the conductance values for three different armchair graphene nanoribbon cases : @xmath73 for the metallic case , and @xmath74 for the two semiconducting cases@xcite . in other words ,",
    "quantum hall conductance through a bipolar junction is expected to be three - fold , depending on the size of the armchair graphene nanoribbons .",
    "as previously mentioned , randomly distributed edge roughness allows the system to contain those three different ribbon widths . additionally , the four - terminal conductance results satisfy flux conservation : the incoming flux from lead 1 is given by @xmath52 because there is a single metallic channel due to @xmath75 , and the sum of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is equal to @xmath52 , resulting in @xmath76 .",
    "the half - and - half conductance splitting leads to the conclusion that the interplay of the topological interface states from the lowest lls undergoes full mixing .",
    "compared to the lowest - ll case , the interplay nature between higher - index lls at the bipolar junction in quantum hall graphene is more complicated .",
    "figure [ fg : roughcond](b ) shows the four - terminal conductance results in the presence of edge roughness for @xmath77 , where two topological edge modes exist in each region . note that the contribution of these topological states to the conductance is given by @xmath78 because the higher - index ll is doubly degenerate compared to the lowest ll . around @xmath1 it is seen that @xmath55 is twice as large as @xmath56 , satisfying flux conservation , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "this asymmetric splitting behaviour can be explained by considering the chalker - coddington type argument , where it has been confirmed that the interplay of topological states at the interface can be expressed as a transfer matrix representation@xcite . in the case of @xmath77 , there are four modes in total with the corresponding transfer matrix reading@xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",

    "note that the matrix @xmath87 , which is composed of two diagonal block matrices , implies no coupling between the lowest- and 1st - ll topological states due to the orthogonality of the solutions ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : analsols ] ) ) . in other words",
    ", the orthogonality allows for interplay between the time - reversal partners , based on the fact that particle - hole symmetry exists in the system .",
    "as previously stated , the lowest - ll topological states undergo half - and - half mixing , resulting in @xmath88 , while on the other hand , @xmath89 is expected to be somewhere between 0 and @xmath90 . with the given @xmath88 , @xmath89",
    "can be found using the transfer matrix with the following equation : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "is found to be about @xmath100 , resulting in @xmath101 and @xmath102 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : roughcond](b ) .",
    "consequently , the higher - ll topological states are expected to be `` moderately equilibrated '' at the chern insulator junction .",
    "moreover , it is worth investigating the interplay behaviour for asymmetric chern number configurations , e.g. , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fg : roughcond](b ) . unlike the symmetric cases ,",
    "higher - ll topological states have no time - reversal partner for interplay , differing from the lowest - ll states .",
    "however , because of the asymmetry , the interplay between the lowest - ll states can be changed , making @xmath105 no longer true .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to find values of @xmath106 for various asymmetric configurations of chern numbers , based on the chalker - coddington type argument : @xmath107 for @xmath103 , @xmath108 for @xmath104 , and so on .          as discussed above ,",
    "the mixing nature of the topological interface states at the chern insulator junction is fairly complicated because a number of interface states can be coupled to each other like as a network , and behave according to the chalker - coddington argument . on the other hand ,",
    "there have been findings where mode - mixing at the chern insulator junction can be limited to the lowest - ll mode in the presence of a `` depletion spacer''@xcite .",
    "in fact , realistic device fabrication inevitably causes a smoothening of the potential step for the bipolar junction , which can be described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bipolarcontinuum ] ) . by varying the parameter @xmath109 from the potential profiles ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : bipolarcontinuum ] ) ) , the gradualness of the smoothly varying potential profile can be tuned .",
    "as expected , sufficiently large values of @xmath109 lead to a reduction in @xmath56 , ending up with clear plateaus at @xmath53 regardless of the chern number configurations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : suppression_mixing](a ) .",
    "the reduced conductance from lead 1 to 4 implies that the interplay between topological states is limited to the lowest lls as recently discussed@xcite . in other words ,",
    "suppression of the interplay occurs only for the higher - index lls .",
    "an intuitive explanation for this suppression phenomena can be found by analyzing the probability density when the potential profiles become gradual .",
    "figures [ fg : suppression_mixing](b ) and ( c ) provide a comparison of the probability density of the scattering region between the abrupt and gradual potential profiles .",
    "it is clearly seen that the topological interface states are spatially impelled toward the interior of the system , so that the degree of the interplay at the interface decreases .",
    "it is speculated that the lowest - ll topological states are formed at @xmath50 , where the potential strength is exactly zero , so that the topological states at @xmath50 are almost unaffected by the gradual potential profile .",
    "higher - index ll topological states though are further separated by the gradually varying potentials .",
    "regarding the mode - mixing suppression , it is natural to expect that the suppression of the interplay between the topological interface states depends on the gradualness of the junction profile .",
    "indeed , figs .",
    "[ fg : suppression_mixing](d ) and ( e ) confirm that @xmath56 for the @xmath110 case reaches @xmath53 more rapidly than for the @xmath111 case , as @xmath109 varies .",
    "as expected , the interplay ends up being attributed to the lowest - ll states only , for the sufficiently gradual potential profiles .",
    "therefore , a careful analysis of the conductance plateaus is required to correctly understand the quantum hall measurements through bipolar junctions , including an examination of potential profile steepness .",
    "depending on the slope of the potential profile near the interface , the degree of interplay between topological states can vary , likely resulting in unclear plateau values .",
    "in summary , we have exploited four - terminal quantum hall conductance through a bipolar junction in graphene to understand the interplay nature of the topologically protected states at the junction interface .",
    "the properties of the topological interface states are examined not only by numerical calculations but also analytic solutions , which are in agreement with each other .",
    "we have studied the influence of edge roughness on the splitting of the quantum hall conductance due to the interplay between the topological interface states . from the resulting quantum hall conductance plateaus ,",
    "we have deduced the degree of interplay for various chern number configurations using the chalker - coddington type argument .",
    "we conclude by remarking that , in general , the interplay between topological interface states is described by partial equilibration at a clean interface , as distinct from full equilibration at a rough interface .",
    "moreover , for realistic bipolar junctions in graphene , interplay between higher - ll topological states tends to be suppressed as the potential profiles become gradual .",
    "such a suppression of the interplay phenomena occurs because the higher - ll topological states become spatially farther away from the interface for gradually varying potentials .",
