    "this paper discusses small particles suspended in a randomly moving fluid .",
    "we assume that the fluid flow is mixing , and concentrate on cases where the fluid flow is incompressible ( although compressibility is considered too , for completeness ) . at first sight",
    ", it seems as if the particles suspended in an incompressible mixing flow should become evenly distributed .",
    "if the particles were simply advected by the fluid , this is indeed what would happen .",
    "however , it has been noted that when the effects of finite inertia of the suspended particles are significant , the particles can show a tendency to cluster .",
    "this remarkable unmixing effect was discussed in a theoretical paper by maxey @xcite , who proposed that suspended particles ( assumed denser than the fluid ) cluster because they are centrifuged away from vortices .",
    "there have been many other theoretical papers on this phenomenon , and an experimental demonstration was reported by eaton and fessler @xcite ; the literature is reviewed in section [ sec : 0.2 ] below .",
    "the suspended particles are characterised by the rate @xmath0 at which their velocity relative to the fluid is damped due to viscous drag , and the random velocity field is characterised by a correlation time @xmath1 .",
    "the product @xmath2 is a dimensionless parameter : in much of the literature @xmath3 is termed the stokes number. there is a consensus that the clustering effect is observed when the stokes number is of order unity .",
    "we investigate a random - flow model with short correlation time , which is susceptible to mathematical analysis .",
    "we show that in general this model can exhibit pronounced clustering in circumstances where @xmath4 , when the centrifuge mechanism is not effective .",
    "when the model is applied to fully - developed turbulence it predicts that the clustering is strongest when @xmath5 ( in agreement with most numerical investigations ) , but it indicates that the centrifuge effect is not essential to understanding the phenomenon .",
    "our principal results are series expansions for the lyapunov exponents of the trajectories of the suspended particles in terms of @xmath6 , where the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 ( defined in section [ sec : 0.3 ] below ) is @xmath8 for fully developed turbulent flow , but may be small for other types of random flow .",
    "our analysis of the random - flow model is exact in the limit as @xmath9 : note that in this limit @xmath4 when @xmath10 .",
    "we use the lyapunov exponents to estimate the dimension deficit @xmath11 , which is the difference between the spatial dimension and the ( lyapunov ) fractal dimension @xmath12 of the set onto which the particles cluster : @xmath13 ( this will be explained in section [ sec : 0.2 ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig : f1]*a * and [ fig : f1]*b * illustrate our results .",
    "figure [ fig : f1]*a * compares the value of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath14 obtained by simulation of our model with results from a borel summation of our perturbation series .",
    "the results show that there is fractal clustering when @xmath15 in the limit as @xmath9 , indicating that fractal clustering can occur for large stokes numbers . despite the fact that our perturbation series is divergent , we obtain satisfactory results from borel summation .",
    "figure [ fig : f1]*b * compares the results from a direct numerical simulations of particles in a turbulent navier - stokes flow ( these data ( @xmath16 ) are taken from @xcite ) with results from our random - flow model : the data used for figure [ fig : f1]*a * are re - plotted with the value of @xmath17 chosen to give the best fit between the two curves , as judged by eye .",
    "( we can not determine the scaling theoretically because the value of @xmath7 for fully developed turbulence is not known ) .",
    "the theoretical curve in figure [ fig : f1]*b * is obtained from our random - flow model , which has vanishingly small correlation time ( because for given @xmath14 , @xmath18 as @xmath9 ) .",
    "the centrifuge effect can not therefore cause clustering in this random - flow model .",
    "our model has a maximum dimension deficit of approximately @xmath19 , as opposed to @xmath20 for particles in a navier - stokes flow , and the form of the curves is similar .",
    "we conclude that the random - flow model provides a satisfying degree of agreement with full navier - stokes dynamics , despite the fact that the centrifuge mechanism plays no role .",
    "another mechanism for clustering is the formation of fold caustics in the flow of the particles .",
    "we show that caustics are prevalent when @xmath21 .",
    "we also consider an explicit expression for the sum of the lyapunov exponents when the stokes number is small . taken together with earlier results on the overdamped limit ( referred to in sections [ sec : 0.2 ] , [ sec : 7 ] and [ sec : 8 ] ) , our results give a satisfyingly complete understanding of the local dynamics of suspended particles .",
    "some of the results were summarised in an earlier letter @xcite .",
    "we first briefly review earlier work on clustering in random flows , before giving a fuller description of our results .",
    "maxey @xcite expressed the trajectory of an inertial particle in terms of a synthetic velocity field , which is obtained as a perturbation of the velocity field of the fluid .",
    "he showed that this synthetic velocity field has negative divergence when the vorticity is high or the strain - rate low , and predicted that particles would have low concentrations in regions of high vorticity due to this centrifuge effect. a correlation between particle density and vorticity has been seen in direct numerical simulation of particles suspended in a fully - developed turbulent flow @xcite .",
    "the mechanism proposed by maxey led to a prediction concerning the observability of this preferential concentration effect .",
    "it is plausible that the centrifuge mechanism will be less effective when the particles are overdamped ( @xmath22 ) or when the velocity fluctuates too rapidly to allow the density of suspended particles to respond ( when @xmath23 ) .",
    "this leads to the hypothesis that the preferential concentration effect should only be observed when @xmath24 is close to unity .",
    "experimental work on particles suspended in fully developed turbulent air flows @xcite appears to support this hypothesis , as do computer simulations @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach arises from work of sommerer and ott @xcite , who discuss patterns formed by particles floating on a randomly moving fluid .",
    "they characterise these patterns in terms of their fractal dimension , and suggest that the fractal dimension can be obtained from ratios of lyapunov exponents @xmath25 of the particle trajectories , using a formula proposed by kaplan and yorke @xcite .",
    "the argument of sommerer and ott extends directly to particles suspended in turbulent three - dimensional flows .",
    "the spatial particle flow is characterised by three lyapunov exponents , @xmath26 , and provided @xmath27 ( which is always true for the particles moving in an incompressible fluid flow ) , the kaplan - yorke estimate for the fractal dimension is determined by the dimensionless quantity @xmath28 which we term the dimension deficit. when @xmath29 , the kaplan - yorke estimate of the dimension , termed the lyapunov dimension , is @xmath30 and @xmath31 if @xmath32 .",
    "clustering effects are significant if the fractal dimension is significantly lower than the dimension of space . the relations ( [ eq : 0.0 ] ) , ( [ eq : 0.1 ] ) give a strong motivation to investigate the lyapunov exponents of suspended particles .",
    "bec @xcite has performed detailed numerical investigations for a specific ensemble of random flow fields , showing how the kaplan - yorke fractal dimension varies as a function of the stokes number for his model flow , reaching a minimum for a value of @xmath24 which is of order unity .",
    "these numerical calculations of the dimension deficit are complementary to the ideas proposed by maxey in @xcite , in that they quantify the clustering effect without explaining its origin .    the motivation for investigating lyapunov exponents can also be explained without referring to the fractal dimension . for three - dimensional flows ,",
    "the sum of the three largest lyapunov exponents of the particle trajectories may be negative , implying that volume elements almost always contract .",
    "however , for incompressible flows the first lyapunov exponent is always positive , implying that nearby particles almost surely separate .",
    "if @xmath33 is negative , there is a tendency for particles to cluster , but if the magnitude of this quantity is small compared to unity the clustering effect will be negligible , because in that case clusters are stretched and folded more rapidly than their density accumulates .",
    "most of the theoretical work on clustering in turbulent flows has emphasised instantaneous correlations between vortices and particle - density fluctuations .",
    "there is an alternative viewpoint on the origin of density fluctuations which is also theoretically tenable , and which is the basis for our own analysis .",
    "it can be argued that the density fluctuations are generated by a multiplicative random process : volume elements in the particle flow are randomly compressed or expanded , and the ratio of the final density to the initial density after many multiples of the correlation time @xmath1 can be modeled as a product of a large number of random factors . according to his picture , the density fluctuations will be a record of the history of the flow , and may bear no relation to the instantaneous disposition of vortices when the particle density is measured .",
    "the particle density is expected to have a log - normal probability distribution , and the mean value of the logarithm is related to the lyapunov exponents of the flow .",
    "this is another motivation for calculating lyapunov exponents .",
    "the idea of considering clustering due to random flows has been used in earlier work which adapted results relating to purely advective flows .",
    "most of this literature treats the limiting case where the correlation time of the velocity field is very short , a case which is known as the kraichnan model @xcite .",
    "the lyapunov exponents of such advective flows have been calculated in different ways by several authors : these calculations include results for compressible and solenoidal ( incompressible ) flows : the earliest calculation appears to be by lejan @xcite , who treated a spatially correlated brownian motion .",
    "later work @xcite subsequently showed that the same results apply to a flow with a smooth time dependence , but a very short correlation time .",
    "these calculations on purely advective flows can not explain clustering of particles suspended in incompressible flows , because the density of advected particles remains constant for incompressible flow .",
    "elperin @xcite proposed to analyse the motion of inertial particles by applying results derived for advective flows to the synthetic velocity field derived by maxey @xcite , which has a compressible component .",
    "the same approach was subsequently adopted in @xcite .",
    "the approximations employed in these papers make use of results from the kraichnan model of passive scalars @xcite , valid in the limit where the correlation time @xmath1 approaches zero ( st @xmath34 ) . yet maxey s synthetic velocity field",
    "is obtained in the overdamped limit where , by contrast , the stokes number is small , st @xmath35 .    in summary",
    ", the clustering effect can be characterised by calculating the lyapunov exponents of the particle trajectories , but there is a limited theoretical understanding of these , based on maxey s correction to advective flow ( which is derived in the limit where @xmath23 ) .",
    "there is a consensus that significant clustering only occurs when @xmath36 but there is scope for revising this expectation .    our own work @xcite uses a model for a random flow with a very short correlation time , but the effects of particle inertia are properly accounted for .",
    "we remark that a similar approach was proposed by piterbarg @xcite , who studied the largest lyapunov exponent in a two - dimensional flow .      in section [ sec : 1 ]",
    ", we discuss the dimensionless parameters of the model , and in particular we note the significance of an additional dimensionless parameter , the kubo number ( this term is used in the plasma - physics literature , @xcite ) . in terms of a typical fluid velocity @xmath37 and correlation length @xmath38 , the kubo number is @xmath39 .",
    "we argue that @xmath7 can not be large , that @xmath40 for fully - developed turbulent flows , and that @xmath7 may be small in other systems , such as randomly stirred fluids .",
    "most of our paper is concerned with the case where the stokes number @xmath3 is large .",
    "this is the underdamped limit where inertial effects are most likely to be significant and where very little work has been done previously . in section",
    "[ sec : 2 ] we show how the three lyapunov exponents for inertial particles can be obtained from expectation values of a system of nine coupled stochastic differential equations .    in section [ sec : 3 ] we discuss how these general equations can be represented by a system of langevin equations in the limit where the stokes number is large and the kubo number is small . a dimensionless",
    "parameter @xmath41 plays a natural role in these langevin equations : inertial effects are significant when @xmath14 is large .",
    "section [ sec : 10 ] shows how the corresponding fokker - planck equation can be mapped to a perturbation of a nine - dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator . using the algebra of harmonic - oscillator raising and lowering operators , we develop perturbation expansions for the lyapunov exponents to large orders in @xmath14 , with exact expressions for the coefficients .",
    "these perturbation expansions are presented in section [ sec : 6 ] and are the principal results in this paper .    in the case where inertia is important",
    "it is possible for the density to diverge due to the formation of caustics , which are surfaces on which the jacobian determinant of the particle flow field vanishes . in section [ sec : 6 ] we also quantify the rate of formation of these caustic surfaces .",
    "caustics can have a very significant effect on the aggregation of suspended particles , because they can produce a divergent density of particles in a finite time @xcite and because they greatly increase the relative velocity of suspended particles @xcite .",
    "the perturbation series are divergent , and in section [ sec : 6 ] we also discuss their summation by borel - pad methods .",
    "we find excellent agreement with numerical simulations in some cases , but there are revealing discrepancies in other cases : some of our borel - pad summations differ from monte - carlo evaluations by quantities which have a non - analytic dependence on the perturbation parameter @xmath14 , of the form @xmath42 ( for some constant @xmath43 ) .",
    "in section [ sec : wkb ] we consider a wkb approach to solving the fokker - planck equation , and indicate how such non - analytic contributions arise .",
    "section [ sec : 7 ] makes connections between our results and earlier work on lyapunov exponents of advected particles : we show that the leading - order term in our perturbation series agrees with the lyapunov exponent for advective flow , and we show that in the limit as @xmath9 the same expression for the lyapunov exponent holds , regardless of whether @xmath24 is large or small . in the case",
    "where the flow is incompressible the sum of the lyapunov exponents for advected particles is zero . in section [ sec : 8 ] we calculate the leading contribution due to the sum of the lyapunov exponents for particles in an incompressible flow when @xmath44 and @xmath45 : the results confirm that @xmath12 is very close to @xmath46 when @xmath22 .",
    "our results have important consequences for the theory of particle clustering .",
    "the existing consensus favours the view that clustering only occurs when @xmath47 , and is the result of the centrifuge effect. our results present a different picture .",
    "clustering onto a fractal set occurs when @xmath48 , defined by ( [ eq : 0.0 ] ) , is positive , and becomes significant when this number is of order unity .",
    "both simulations and the borel - pad ' e summations in section [ sec : 6 ] indicate that when @xmath49 and @xmath45 , @xmath48 is positive when @xmath50 is less than a critical value @xmath51 , and achieves its maximum value of @xmath52 when @xmath14 equals @xmath53 . thus we establish that clustering can be significant when @xmath49 , provided that @xmath45 .",
    "our results on the overdamped limit obtained in section [ sec : 8 ] indicate that although @xmath54 when @xmath44 , it is very small , implying that clustering effects are hard to observe when @xmath44 . for fully developed turbulence",
    "we have @xmath55 , which is on the border of the region of validity of our theory , but a plot of @xmath48 versus @xmath56 for our model ( figure [ fig : f1]*b * ) shows satisfying agreement with numerical simulations of turbulent flows ( after scaling @xmath56 to account for uncertainties in the definitions of correlations times ) .",
    "this indicates that the centrifuge mechanism makes a marginal contribution to the clustering process .",
    "systems such as randomly stirred fluids , or particles falling under gravity through fully developed turbulence , can exhibit flows where @xmath45 , and may exhibit clustering for large values of @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that the particles suspended in the fluid flow satisfy the equations of motion @xmath57\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the position of a particle , @xmath59 is the particle momentum , @xmath60 is its mass and @xmath61 denotes the velocity field .",
    "we neglect effects due to the inertia of the displaced fluid : this is justified when @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the densities of the fluid and particles respectively . equations ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) are appropriate for spherical particles when the reynolds number of the flow referred to the particle diameter is small , and when the particle radius @xmath65 satisfies @xmath66 .",
    "further conditions are required for the validity of this formula : these can always be satisfied if the radius of the particle and the molecular mean free path of the fluid are sufficiently small @xcite .    stokes",
    "s formula gives the relaxation rate @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "the neglect of the mass of the displaced fluid is an excellent approximation for aerosol systems , and satisfactory for many examples of solid particles in water .",
    "we also assume that the effect of brownian diffusion of the particles is negligible : the ratio of the particle diffusion constant to the molecular diffusion constant of the fluid is proportional to the ratio of the molecular mean free path to the particle diameter .",
    "we characterise the random velocity field by its statistics , denoting the expectation value of a quantity @xmath69 by @xmath70 .",
    "we assume that the mean velocity is zero : @xmath71 .",
    "the velocity field can be characterised by its correlation function , which has a correlation length @xmath38 and a correlation time @xmath1 .",
    "the fluctuations of the fluid velocity have a characteristic scale @xmath37 : in a single - scale flow we would define @xmath72 , but in fully developed turbulence it is more natural to define @xmath37 as the velocity scale associated with fluctuations on the dissipative scale , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the rate of dissipation per unit mass @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) are characterised by four dimensional parameters .",
    "the random velocity field is described by three scales : @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the interaction of the fluid with the particles is described by the damping rate @xmath75 .",
    "( the mass @xmath60 can be eliminated from the two components of ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) , but may appear in expressions which contain forces ) .",
    "from the four quantities @xmath76 we can form two independent dimensionless groups , the kubo number , @xmath7 and the stokes number , @xmath77 .",
    "the degree to which the velocity field is compressible is described by a further dimensionless variable , @xmath78 , which will be defined in section [ sec : 3 ] .",
    "the average number of suspended particles per unit volume , @xmath79 , is associated with a further independent dimensionless parameter , @xmath80 .",
    "the set of dimensionless parameters of the system is therefore @xmath81 we consider flow fields ranging from incompressible flow ( which corresponds to @xmath82 , see equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) in section [ sec : 3 ] ) to pure potential flow ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "we concentrate on the underdamped limit ( @xmath23 , large stokes number ) , but also give results for the overdamped situation .",
    "we argue on physical grounds that @xmath17 can not be large , and that @xmath84 for fully developed turbulence . for real flows satisfying the navier - stokes equations ,",
    "the velocity field is self - convected , so that temporal variations of the velocity field at any point are partly due to the sweeping action of the flow .",
    "if @xmath37 is the characteristic velocity and @xmath38 , @xmath1 are the spatial and temporal correlation scales , then the transport of the velocity field by its own action will cause it to fluctuate on a time scale @xmath85 , which can not be less than the actual correlation time of the field .",
    "thus @xmath39 can not be large .",
    "small kubo numbers are realised in randomly stirred fluids where the reynolds number is small enough that the flow does not spontaneously generate turbulence .",
    "for fully developed turbulence , the kolmogorov theory @xcite indicates that @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath1 are all functions of @xmath86 and @xmath68 , and dimensional considerations imply that @xmath55 .",
    "our analytical results are all derived in the limit where @xmath87 , so that fully - developed turbulence is on the borderline of applicability of our theory .    a practically important measure of the degree of clustering is given by the ratio of the largest observed particle density @xmath88 to the mean particle density .",
    "the parameter @xmath89 will have a pronounced effect on the distribution pattern of the particles .",
    "when @xmath90 is sufficiently small , the particles will appear as a random scatter if the largest lyapunov exponent ( defined below ) is positive .",
    "the set of particle positions is a point set which randomly samples a fractal measure , but the fractal is only visible when @xmath89 is sufficiently large . for large @xmath90 , the density - enhancement factor @xmath91 may be very large , even when the parameter @xmath48 ( defined by ( [ eq : 0.0 ] ) ) is small",
    ". a quantitative discussion of these issues would be quite lengthy .",
    "accordingly , in this paper we will consider only locally defined properties of the particle trajectories , namely the lyapunov exponents and the rate of caustic formation , both of which are defined below .",
    "we remark that the dimensionless parameters @xmath7 and @xmath90 have apparently not been considered in earlier papers on clustering of particles in random flow fields .",
    "uncertainties about the intended values of these parameters makes some of the literature quite difficult to understand .",
    "the lyapunov exponents @xmath25 , @xmath92 are rate constants which are defined in terms of the time dependence of small separations of trajectories from a reference trajectory @xmath93 .",
    "we consider three trajectories which have infinitesimal displacements from the reference trajectory , @xmath94 , @xmath92 .",
    "we then consider the length @xmath95 of a small separation between two trajectories , the area @xmath96 of a parallelogram spanned by two separation vectors and the volume @xmath97 of a parallelepiped spanned by a triad of separations .",
    "the lyapunov exponents are defined by writing @xmath98 if @xmath99 , pairs of particles coalesce with probability unity . if @xmath100 and @xmath101 , particles cluster onto randomly moving lines , which stretch and fold . if @xmath27 but @xmath102 , the particles cluster onto randomly stretching and folding surfaces .",
    "another locally defined statistic is the rate of caustic formation .",
    "there is no constraint which prevents two of the three vectors defining the separation between nearby particles becoming collinear , so that the volume element @xmath103 becomes zero for an instant in time .",
    "these events correspond to caustics , where faster moving particles overtake slower ones @xcite ( see figure [ fig : c ] for an illustration in one spatial dimension ) .",
    "caustics influence the spatial particle distribution and the relative velocities of nearby particles .",
    "there is an increased density of particles on the fold caustics ( which are a pair of points in the one - dimensional example of figure [ fig : c ] , but which form surfaces in three dimensions ) , and the particle density on the caustics diverges in the limit as @xmath104 .",
    "this effect is discussed in @xcite : it is analogous to the divergence of light intensity on optical caustics @xcite .",
    "the other effect of caustics is that the particle velocity field becomes multi - valued in the region between the caustics ( in figure [ fig : c ] the velocity field is triple - valued between the caustics ) .",
    "because particles at the same position are moving with differing velocities , the caustics enhance the rate of collision of suspended particles @xcite ( this has no analogue in optical caustics ) .",
    "caustics therefore facilitate the aggregation of suspended particles .",
    "we define @xmath105 , the rate of caustic formation , as the rate at which events where @xmath106 occur for a given triplet of nearby trajectories .",
    "we define a dimensionless rate @xmath107 by @xmath108 .",
    "linearising the equations of motion ( [ eq : 1.1 ] ) gives @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a matrix with elements proportional to the rate - of - strain matrix : @xmath111 ( from this point we will use greek subscripts to label components in three dimensional space , reserving roman indices for components in a nine - dimensional space which appears later ) . to determine the lyapunov exponents we consider three trajectories displaced relative to a reference trajectory by @xmath112 , with @xmath113 .",
    "we choose to parametrise the spatial displacements as follows @xmath114\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath115 form a triplet of orthogonal unit unit vectors .",
    "nine variables are required to parametrise the spatial displacements @xmath116 .",
    "two parameters specify the direction of @xmath117 , and a further angular parameter specifies the direction of @xmath118 relative to @xmath119 .",
    "there is only a binary choice in the direction of @xmath120 , and we resolve this by requiring continuity .",
    "this means that a further six parameters are required , and ( [ eq : 2.3 ] ) does indeed contain a further six parameters , namely @xmath121 .    for the choice of parametrisation above , the small elements required in ( [ eq : 2.4 ] ) are @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we can then extract the lyapunov exponents from expectation values of logarithmic derivatives of the variables used in our parametrisation : @xmath125 the angles @xmath126 and @xmath127 both decrease with probability unity , and eventually we retain only leading orders in these variables . initially , however , we retain all terms .",
    "the equations of motion for the displacements @xmath116 also contain corresponding increments of momentum , @xmath128 .",
    "these will be parametrised in terms of the nine elements of a @xmath129 matrix @xmath130 by writing @xmath131 substituting this relation into ( [ eq : 2.1 ] ) gives the equation of motion for @xmath130 : @xmath132 now we determine the equations of motion for the parameters determining @xmath133 .",
    "differentiating each line of ( [ eq : 2.3 ] ) with respect to time , and then using the second equation of ( [ eq : 2.1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath134 & & \\dot x_2({\\bf n}_1+\\delta \\theta{\\bf n}_2 ) + x_2(\\dot { \\bf n}_1+\\delta \\theta \\dot { \\bf n}_2)+x_2\\delta \\dot \\theta { \\bf n}_2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{1cm}={1\\over m}x_2{\\bf r}(t)({\\bf n}_1+\\delta \\theta { \\bf n}_2 ) \\nonumber \\\\[2 mm ] & & \\dot x_3[{\\bf",

    "we therefore seek a relation of the form @xmath267 for some constants @xmath192 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 .",
    "this relation is only dimensionally consistent for @xmath270 , @xmath271 , which makes the result independent upon @xmath74 ( and furthermore implies that it vanishes at @xmath272 ) .",

    "the results give important new insights into the mechanism for particle clustering .",
    "the relevant dimensionless parameter is @xmath586 , and we find that the dimension deficit is significant when @xmath50 is of order unity , reaching a maximum value of @xmath52 at @xmath587 .",
    "this contradicts the accepted explanation for particle clustering , based on the centrifuge mechanism , because ( when @xmath45 ) it implies that clustering onto a fractal set can occur when the stokes number @xmath588 is large . for fully developed turbulent flow , we have @xmath40 so that @xmath589 , and in that case our theory does predict that clustering onto a fractal set occurs when the stokes number is of order unity .",
    "this is consistent with numerical experiments .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the centrifuge effect has some relevance , however we note that our theory predicts @xmath590 for the maximal dimension deficit , see figure [ fig : f1]*b * , also @xcite .",
    "the value obtained from direct numerical simulations of a navier - stokes flow is very similar , @xmath591 @xcite .    for @xmath592 ,",

    "figure 7 is a schematic illustration of how the unmixing of particles suspended in an incompressible fluid ( that is a flow with @xmath82 ) depends upon the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath24 .",

    "we showed that in the limit of @xmath596 the dynamics behaves like advection , even if @xmath49 .",
    "we make some final comments concerning the situations in which clustering should be observable .",
    "the velocity field of fully - developed turbulent flow has a power - law energy spectrum , with an upper and lower cutoff @xcite .",
    "the smaller length scale is the kolmogorov length , defined by @xmath597 where @xmath68 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath74 is the rate of dissipation per unit mass of fluid .",
    "this is the size of the smallest vortices generated by the turbulence . in section [ sec : 3.3 ] we show that it is this small length scale @xmath598 which corresponds to the correlation length @xmath38 in our theory .",
    "our results indicate that clustering can certainly occur on a scale smaller than @xmath38 , but what happens on larger length scales is less certain .",
    "it is not entirely clear whether particles in turbulent flows can exhibit clustering effects on length scales greater than the kolmogorov length , @xmath598 .",
    "particles separated by distances greater than @xmath598 will be separated by richardson diffusion @xcite , but that is not necessarily incompatible with some type of clustering .",
    "numerical evidence for such an effect has been presented @xcite , but the range of stokes and reynolds numbers are not sufficiently large to allow clear conclusions . at very small stokes number , suspended particles",
    "are advected and must be mixed to uniform concentration in a turbulent flow . at large stokes number ,",
    "however , it is conceivable that particles could be centrifuged away from vortices with length scale @xmath599 when their rotation period @xmath600 is such that the length - dependent stokes number @xmath601 is of order unity @xcite .",
    "the kolmogorov theory gives @xmath602 .",
    "consequently this picture implies clustering on a length scale @xmath603",
    ".    however , there is an argument which suggests that such large - scale clusters might not form . at large stokes number",
    ", the formation of numerous caustics implies that the velocity field of the suspended particles is multi - valued , so that in the limit @xmath18 the suspended particles are expected to behave as a gas @xcite .",
    "particles at the same position move with relative speed @xmath604 ; using the kolmogorov cascade principle , we estimate that the variance of @xmath604 is @xmath605 @xcite .",
    "the motion of the suspended particles is damped at a rate @xmath75 , so that they travel in an approximately straight line for a distance @xmath606 .",
    "we see that @xmath607 .",
    "so particles within a cluster of size @xmath608 travel distances of order @xmath608 in random directions before their relative motion is damped out .",
    "this argument suggests that clustering may be difficult to observe on scales larger than the kolmogorov length .",
    "the kolmogorov scale is rather insensitive to the value of @xmath86 : for @xmath609 ( air at standard atmospheric conditions ) and @xmath610 , we have @xmath611 .",
    "our results concerning the lyapunov exponents are relevant to clustering of particles on length scales below the kolmogorov length and therefore describe clustering on very small length scales",
    ". they would be relevant to the aggregation of aerosol particles , but it seems unlikely that it could explain the macroscopic clustering observed in the experiments of fessler and eaton and @xcite .    in discussing the conditions under which the clustering effect is observable",
    ", we must also consider the effects of gravity .",
    "gravitational effects may be assumed negligible when motion at the terminal velocity moves particles by a distance which is small compared to @xmath38 in time @xmath1 .",
    "noting that the terminal velocity is @xmath612 , this condition may be written @xmath613 .",
    "for fully developed turbulence , using the kolmogorov theory we estimate @xmath614 this quantity is small only for highly energetic turbulence .",
