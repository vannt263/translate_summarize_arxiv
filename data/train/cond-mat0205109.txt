    "one major advantage of soft matter systems in comparison to their atomic counterparts is the ability one has to engineer the constituent particles at the molecular level . in this way",
    ", an enormous variety in architectures can be achieved , leading to a corresponding richness in the structural and phase behaviour of such systems .",
    "polymers play a prominent example within this class of materials .",
    "they come in a variety of forms , such as , e.g. , as linear chains , branched , star - shaped , dendritic , copolymer , as well as functions , e.g. , steric stabilisers , additives , depletants etc .",
    "additional flexibility arises from the possibility of influencing the structural and phase behaviour of polymer solutions by changing the solvent quality .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the task of bridging the gap between the microscopic and macroscopic length scales of polymeric systems is a formidable one .",
    "indeed , the constituent macromolecules may contain thousands or even millions of atoms , interconnected to one another in complicated ways .",
    "the program of starting with the individual interactions between monomers and proceeding to the calculation of the free energy of the system rapidly becomes intractable .",
    "however , considerable progress can be made if one invokes a `` coarse - graining '' procedure , a point of view that has been proved very fruitful in many areas of research in condensed matter physics .",
    "here we follow a two - step procedure . first , instead of attempting to carry out the statistical trace over all the individual monomers in one step , a certain generalised coordinate of the macromolecule as an effective point particle is invoked .",
    "examples include the centre of mass of the polymer or some suitably selected monomer , as we explain below .",
    "all monomers belonging to the macromolecules are then traced out for a given , fixed configuration of the effective coordinates , which defines an _ effective interaction _ between these coordinates @xcite .",
    "once this is achieved , the second step consists of viewing the the macroscopic system as collection of point particles interacting by means of the effective interaction .",
    "now all known tools from the theory of atomic and molecular fluids can be employed to derive structural and thermodynamic quantities for the system under consideration .    in the recent years",
    ", the program sketched above has been carried out with success for various polymeric systems .",
    "it has been found that the effective interactions obtained belong to a new class of ultrasoft potentials which have very unusual properties when compared with the hard - sphere ( hs ) system , the prototype of atomic liquids . in this work ,",
    "we first present a concise review of these novel properties for the fluid phases and then some new results regarding the rich variety of crystal structures that can be stabilised by ultrasoft potentials .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section [ effective.section ]",
    "we give the general definition of the effective interaction and present specific examples for a number of systems that have been worked out recently . in section [ mff.section ]",
    "we show that the systems described by ultrasoft interactions are well described by a simple mean - field picture in the fluid phase for a wide range of thermodynamic conditions . to further delineate these systems we define two categories of mean - field fluids , the _ strong _ and the _ weak _ ones .",
    "the former are characterised by a direct correlation function @xmath0 that satisfies to excellent accuracy the condition @xmath1 in broad regions of the thermodynamics space , where @xmath2 is the interparticle pair potential .",
    "the latter only satisfy an approximate mean - field picture for their thermodynamic properties , and not for their structure . in section [ cluster.section ]",
    "we demonstrate that strong mean - field fluids can be further divided into two categories : those displaying reentrant melting and those displaying a cascade of clustering transitions , the criterion being set by the positivity of the fourier transform of the effective interaction . in section [ exotic.section ] we discuss the richness of the phase diagrams of weak mean - field fluids , taking the case of star polymers as a concrete example .",
    "reentrant melting as well as a wealth of structural phase transitions and exotic crystal phases are all shown to be stemming from the ultrasoftness of the effective interactions .",
    "finally , in section [ summary.section ] we summarise and conclude .",
    "the effective interaction between flexible , fluctuating aggregates can be given a precise statistical - mechanical definition .",
    "let us consider a solution containing @xmath3 polymeric macromolecules , each one of them composed of @xmath4 monomers .",
    "the total number of particles in the system is @xmath5 .",
    "one starts from the full hamiltonian @xmath6 of the problem , assumed to be known .",
    "then , out of the @xmath7 particles in the problem ( in our case all monomers ) , one selects the @xmath3 ones that are to be considered as `` effective particles '' and holds them fixed in some prescribed configuration @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the position of the @xmath10-th effective particle .",
    "afterwards , the @xmath11 remaining particles are canonically traced out and the result of this integration is a constrained partition function @xmath12 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath13 is defined as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , with the absolute temperature @xmath16 and boltzmann s constant @xmath17 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that such an effective hamiltonian has two useful properties : it preserves the overall thermodynamics of the system and it guarantees that the correlation functions of any order between any of the @xmath3 remaining particles remain invariant , regardless of whether the expectation values are calculated with the original hamiltonian @xmath6 or with the effective one @xmath13 . though the procedure of tracing out the @xmath11 degrees of freedom necessarily generates interactions of all orders between the @xmath3 particles @xcite in many cases it is sufficient to truncate those at the pair level , introducing thereby the _ pair - potential approximation_. the great advantage of employing this point of view is that , in comparison with the original problem , the numbers of particles , @xmath7 , has been reduced by a factor @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , whereas in the original problem the pair interactions between the monomers are quite complicated , due to the need of taking into account the connectivity and architecture of the molecule , in the effective description the pair potential is spherically symmetric , depending only on the magnitude of the separation vector between the two effective coordinates .",
    "a new picture of the polymers emerges thereby in which the latter can be seen as ultrasoft colloids having a dimension of the order of their radius of gyration @xmath18 .",
    "this sets at the same time the characteristic length scale of the effective interaction between them .",
    "when the polymers are neutral , @xmath18 is the only length scale appearing in this colloidal description , whereas if they carry charge , additional scales set , e.g. , by the concentration of the solution , the counterions and/or the salt ions also come into play .",
    "we examine some characteristic cases below .    _",
    "polymer chains .",
    "_ two possible choices for the effective coordinates have been investigated thus far .",
    "one possibility is to consider the effective interaction @xmath19 between the _ centres of mass _ of the linear chains , when these are kept fixed at a distance @xmath20 from one another .",
    "this was first done in the pioneering work of flory and krigbaum @xcite , who found a gaussian interaction between the centers of mass .",
    "although the functional form of the flory - krigbaum potential is correct , the dependence of the prefactor on the degree of polymerisation @xmath4 is not : whereas the flory - krigbaum mean - field approach predicts a @xmath21-dependence the prefactor turns out to be @xmath4-independent for sufficiently large @xmath4 , as can be easily seen from examining the polymer second virial coefficient .",
    "standard scaling arguments show that the radius of gyration @xmath18 is the only relevant length scale for the dilute and semi - dilute regimes of polymers in a good solvent @xcite .",
    "this immediately implies that the second - virial coefficient should scale as @xmath22 , which , in turn , implies that effective interaction must have an amplitude that is independent of @xmath18 @xcite , at least in the scaling limit .    a number of simulational @xcite as well as theoretical approaches @xcite involving two self - avoiding chains , reached the conclusion that the aforementioned interaction has a gaussian form .",
    "the lack of divergence of this effective interaction at zero separation should not be surprising .",
    "indeed , the centres of mass of two polymer chains can coincide without any of the monomers violating the excluded volume conditions .",
    "in addition , it can be seen that the effective `` particles '' one chooses for the coarse - grained description of the system do not need to be real particles of the physical system .    recently , louis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have independently carried out state - of - the art simulations involving not just two but @xmath23 chains and varying the number of chains to cover a very broad range of concentrations , ranging from dilute solutions up to nine times the overlap concentration .",
    "they confirmed that the effective potential has a gaussian - like form which at zero density can be well approximated by @xmath24 ,   \\label{vcom.eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for higher densities",
    "a superposition of three gaussians provides a very accurate fit @xcite , but the basic shape does not deviate much from the low - density gaussian form . the rather weak density dependence can be shown to arise from the density independent many - body forces @xcite .",
    "moreover , the same authors have shown that employing this effective interaction leads to a very accurate description of the thermodynamics ( equation of state ) of polymer solutions for a wide range of concentrations , thus confirming the validity of the idea that polymer chains can be viewed as soft colloids @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to consider the end - monomers or the central monomers of the chains as effective coordinates @xcite .",
    "general scaling arguments establish that in this case the effective interaction diverges logarithmically with the monomer - monomer separation @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "when the central monomers are chosen , linear chains are equivalent to star polymers with @xmath27 arms . motivated by this analogy , jusufi _ et al .",
    "@xcite derived the effective interaction @xmath28 by combining monomer - resolved , off - lattice simulations with theoretical arguments .",

    "for @xmath27 the value @xmath33 has been obtained @xcite , which , together with the potential in eq .",

    "the strength of the divergence is controlled by the functionality @xmath39 , so that at the formal limit @xmath47 the interaction ( [ pot_ss ] ) tends to the hs - potential .    _ polyelectrolyte stars . _",
    "if the polymer chains of a star polymer contain ionisable groups , the latter dissociate upon solution in a polar ( aqueous ) solvent , leaving behind charged monomers and resulting in a solution consisting of charged star polymers and counterions .",
    "the resulting macromolecules are called polyelectrolyte ( pe ) stars . in pe",
    "stars the chains are stretched due to the coulomb repulsion of the charged monomers .",
    "the degree of stretching and condensation of counterions on the rods depends on the amount of charge and on the bjerrum length . for moderate to high charging fractions",

    "this interaction , @xmath48 , is dominated by the entropic contribution of the counterions that remain trapped within the star corona . for a broad range of functionalities and charge fractions ,",
    "it can be accurately described by the fit : @xmath49 +        \\frac{2}{5}\\left[\\left(\\frac{r}{\\sigma}\\right)^{2-\\zeta } -1\\right ]      + \\frac{3(1-\\zeta)}{5(1+\\kappa \\sigma ) } &   { \\rm { for $ r\\leq \\sigma$ } } ; \\\\",

    "the last condition ensures that the potential of eq .",
    "( [ vpes.eq ] ) above tends to a finite value as @xmath46 .",
    "hence , once more we are dealing with an ultrasoft interaction that varies slowly as the particle centres approach one another .",
    "ultrasoft interactions therefore describe quite a number of different systems .",
    "their common characteristic is that the constituent particles are polymers of various architectures that dominate the spatial extent of the aggregates . in other words ,",
    "one expects similar ultrasoft interactions to show up also when one deals with core - shell particles , consisting of a solid core and a polymeric shell , whenever the thickness of the latter greatly exceeds the radius of the former .",
    "in addition , the ultrasoft interactions can be tuned by controlling the number of arms , the charge , the length of the chains , the generation number ( in the case of dendrimers ) etc .",
    "hence , it is useful to explore the general characteristics of this family of potentials and the ramifications they have on the structural and thermodynamic properties of the fluid and crystal phases of such systems .",
    "motivated by the fact that effective interactions between polymeric colloids can be _ bounded _ (",
    "i.e. , finite at all separations @xmath20 ) , we examine here in general the properties of systems characterised by pair potentials of the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 for all @xmath57 . in eq .",
    "( [ bounded.eq ] ) above , @xmath36 is an energy scale and @xmath50 a length scale .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 is non - attractive , i.e. , @xmath58 everywhere .",
    "we introduce dimensionless measures of temperature and density as @xmath59 where @xmath17 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath60 is the density of a system of @xmath4 particles in the volume @xmath61 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath62 as the ` packing fraction ' of the system .",
    "the key idea for examining the high temperature and/or high density limit of such model systems in three and higher dimensions is the following .",
    "we consider in general a spatially modulated density profile @xmath63 which does not vary too rapidly on the scale @xmath50 set by the interaction . at high densities , @xmath64 ,",
    "the average interparticle distance @xmath65 becomes vanishingly small , and it holds @xmath66 , i.e. , the potential is extremely long - range .",
    "every particle is simultaneously interacting with an enormous number of neighboring molecules and in the absence of short - range excluded volume interactions the excess free energy of the system @xcite can be cast in the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) to be equal to the internal energy of the system @xcite : @xmath67 \\cong { { 1}\\over{2 } } \\int\\int { \\rm d}^3 r { \\rm d}^3 r ' v(|{\\bf r } - { \\bf r'}| ) \\rho({\\bf r } ) \\rho({\\bf r ' } ) , \\label{dft.mfa}\\ ] ] with the approximation becoming more accurate with increasing density .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ dft.mfa ] ) immediately implies that in this limit the direct correlation function @xmath0 of the system , defined as @xcite @xmath68}\\over   { \\delta \\rho({\\bf r } ) \\delta \\rho({\\bf r ' } ) } } , \\label{dcf.dft}\\ ] ] becomes independent of the density and is simply proportional to the interaction , namely @xmath69 using the last equation , together with the ornstein - zernike relation @xcite , we readily obtain an analytic expression for the structure factor @xmath70 of the system as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the fourier transform of @xmath73",
    ".    bounded and positive - definite interactions have been studied in the late 1970s by grewe and klein @xcite .",
    "the authors considered a kac potential of the form : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the dimension of the space and @xmath76 is a parameter controlling the range _ and _ strength of the potential .",
    "moreover , @xmath77 is a nonnegative , bounded and integrable function .",
    "grewe and klein showed rigorously that at the limit @xmath78 , the direct correlation function of a system interacting by means of the potential ( [ kac ] ) is given by eq .",
    "( [ mfa ] ) above .",
    "the connection with the case we are discussing here is straightforward : as there are no hard cores in the system or a lattice constant to impose a length scale , the only relevant length is set by the density and is equal to @xmath79 in our model and by the parameter @xmath80 in model ( [ kac ] ) . in this respect , the limit @xmath78 in the kac model of grewe and klein is equivalent to the limit @xmath81 considered here .",
    "although the limit of grewe and klein corresponds to @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the relation ( [ mfa ] ) has been shown to be an excellent approximation at arbitrarily low temperatures for high enough densities @xcite and for temperatures @xmath84 practically at _ all densities _ @xcite .",
    "hence , the mean - field approximation is valid in a vast range of the thermodynamic space of such systems , which has led to their characterisation as _ mean - field fluids _ ( mff ) @xcite . associated with the structural relation ( [ mfa ] ) are scaling relations of thermodynamic quantities , arising from the compressibility sum rule @xcite : @xmath85 where @xmath86 , and the primes denote the second derivative . from eqs .",
    "( [ mfa ] ) and ( [ compress.sum.rule ] ) it then follows @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "this simple scaling is not at all equivalent to a second virial theory .",
    "in fact , simple virial expansions have a rather small radius of convergence for mean field fluids @xcite .",
    "it then follows that the excess pressure , chemical potential and compressibility satisfy the scaling relations @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite . in the semi - dilute regime",
    "the density dependence of the pair - potentials is necessary to properly describe this correction to simple mff behaviour @xcite . but",
    "this in turn implies that the extra factor @xmath92 in the scaling of the pressure arises from the many - body interactions , since these are what cause the density - dependence in the first place @xcite . ]",
    "all these stem from the validity of the strong _",
    "structural_-mfa relation ( [ mfa ] ) which guarantees the validity of the weaker _ thermodynamical _ mfa relation ( [ mfa.fren ] ) . in",
    "what follows , we will argue that many ultrasoft systems can still satisfy the thermodynamic relation ( [ mfa.fren ] ) approximately , _ without _ satisfying eq .",
    "( [ mfa ] ) . to distinguish between the two classes ,",
    "we now qualify the term `` mean - field fluids '' and call the ones for which both the structural and thermodynamic mfa work well _ strong mean - field fluids_. for such systems , for which the potentials are typically also bounded , the density functional of eq .",
    "( [ dft.mfa ] ) has been extended to mixtures @xcite allowing a straightforward and transparent analysis of the phase separation in the bulk , interfacial @xcite and wetting properties @xcite of such mixtures .",

    "in this section , we turn our attention to the phase behaviour of strong mean - field fluids .",

    "the @xmath113 phase diagram of the model was calculated , showing the existence of two stable crystal structures , fcc for low densities and bcc for high ones .",

    "on the basis of simulation studies at selected thermodynamic points , a rough phase diagram of the gcm has been drawn @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the structural and phase behaviour of the gcm was carried out recently by lang _",
    "there , it was indeed shown that for temperatures @xmath114 the system remains fluid at all densities , whereas for @xmath115 reentrant melting is observed : increasing the density , the system first undergoes a fluid @xmath116 fcc transition , followed by a structural fcc @xmath116 bcc transition and at higher densities the bcc solid remelts , i.e. , a bcc @xmath116 fluid transition takes place .",
    "the width of the solid - phase region grows with decreasing temperature .",
    "a structural signature of this unusual phase diagram in the fluid phase above @xmath117 is an anomaly in the behaviour of the liquid structure factor @xmath70 .",
    "the height of its main peak first grows with increasing density and after achieving a maximum , it decreases again , reflecting the stability of the fluid beyond the reentrant melting .",
    "the hansen - verlet freezing criterion @xcite was shown to be satisfied at _ both _ the freezing and the reentrant melting lines @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was found that at high densities not only the mean - field relation , eq .",
    "( [ mfa ] ) is satisfied to excellent accuracy but also that the hypernetted chain closure ( hnc ) becomes quasi - exact @xcite .",
    "the system becomes ` quasi - ideal ' at those densities , meaning that the radial distribution function has the limiting behaviour @xmath118 .",
    "this , in conjunction with the mean - field property @xmath1 and the exact relation @xmath119 $ ] , forces the bridge function to obey the limit @xmath120 , hence rendering the hnc exact .",
    "the psm was first studied in detail by by means of integral equation theories , computer simulations and cell - model calculations at small temperatures , @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the gcm , no reentrant melting was found . instead",
    ", the freezing line of the system appeared to persist at all temperatures , and cascades of clustering transitions in the solid were found , in which solids with multiple site occupancies are stable with increasing temperature and density .",
    "these findings were independently confirmed in a density - functional study of the low - temperature phase behaviour of the psm @xcite .",
    "sophisticated integral - equation approaches at arbitrarily high temperatures revealed a loss of the solution along the ` diagonal ' @xmath122 of the phase diagram @xcite , again a feature pointing to an instability of the liquid by increasing density at arbitrarily high temperatures .",
    "thus , the psm and the gcm show completely different phase behaviours , although they are both bounded and non - attractive potentials . there is a cascade of clustering transitions for the former , enabling freezing at all temperatures , and a reentrant melting for the latter , associated with the inability to stabilise crystals above a certain critical temperature .",

    "ultrasoft potentials carry unique structural signatures which should in principle be visible in scattering experiments from soft , polymeric fluids .",

    ", it then turns out that the product @xmath169 is constant .",
    "as the free energy cost for the compression of the chains increases with decreasing thickness @xmath75 , it turns out that favourable phases are those for which the interfacial area @xmath168 is minimal .",

    "it is then conceivable that the fcc - lattice will be unfavoured , since its ws cell has a larger area than that of the bcc , for instance . in this way",
    ", ziherl and kamien established a beautiful connection of this problem with lord kelvin s celebrated question of determining the area - minimising partition of space for an arrangement of soap bubbles of equal volume @xcite .",
    "following these arguments , it then turns out that there exists yet another candidate phase that has an area even smaller than the bcc - lattice @xcite , namely the a15-lattice @xcite .",

    "the a15-lattice is not a bravais lattice ; it can be constructed as a simple cubic ( sc ) arrangement with an eight - member basis , thus it contains 8 sites per conventional cell .",
    "its ws - cell is a goldberg decatetrahedron consisting of two hexagonal and 12 pentagonal faces @xcite .",
    "semi - quantitative calculations on the stability of the a15-lattice were carried out by ziherl and kamien @xcite , using a model ` square - shoulder ' potential within a simplified cell model .",
    "narrow regions in thermodynamic phase space were found , in which the a15-lattice was stable but this finding is uncertain in view of the approximations involved and the limited extent of this region . to investigate this question in more detail ,",

    "bco@xmath182 @xmath116 a15 and fcc @xmath116 a15 .",
    "it is an intriguing phenomenon that such a richness in the stable crystal structures and in the nature of the transitions among them occurs as the result of a simple , spherically symmetric interaction and this points to the many surprises of ultrasoft potentials and their tendency to produce open , exotic structures . at the same time , it must be pointed out that we do not expect the solid phases occurring for @xmath201 to survive the competition with a fluid .",
    "indeed , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ stars.phdg.fig ] , the critical functionality @xmath202 below which no solids are stable increases with increasing density .",
    "the bcc - phase is extinguished by the fluid for @xmath203 , whereas the bco- and diamond phases for @xmath204 .",

    "[ latticesums.fig ] for @xmath201 will be wiped out by the fluid there . however , by arbitrarily increasing @xmath39 one can always reach a domain where the fluid will be beaten by the crystal and hence the bco@xmath181 @xmath116 bco@xmath182 @xmath116 a15-transitions will be there also after a finite - temperature calculation . in particular , the a15-phase , on whose stability it has been speculated for some time , has now been proved to be indeed the most stable phase at sufficiently high densities among the candidates considered .",
    "the logarithmic - yukawa potential employed in our study has been shown to describe well the effective interactions between star polymers in a good solvent for a wide range of concentrations . however , at the region of stability of the a15-crystal , the pair potential description is not expected to be particularly accurate .",
    "many - body contributions are expected to become important there @xcite .",
    "moreover , the yukawa tail of the potential , describing the interactions of the outermost daoud - cotton blobs , should be absent since the compressed coronas there are deprived of the outermost blob structure of the isolated stars .",
    "thus , in this respect , the logarithmic - yukawa potential has to be looked upon rather as a toy model .",
    "nevertheless , the physical characteristic driving the transitions discovered above is the ultraslow divergence of the logarithm which , in the neighborhood of the average particle distance can be locally expanded as a ramp - like potential and the finer details of the interaction should become irrelevant .",
    "we have shown that `` ultrasoft interactions '' arise naturally from coarse - graining procedures for a broad range of soft matter systems . besides greatly simplifying the statistical mechanics of these complex systems ",
    "once the interactions are derived , all the well known tools of liquid state theory can be applied to calculate correlations and phase behaviour  they also lead to new phenomenology .",
    "signatures of these ultra soft interactions include anomalous fluid correlations , reentrant melting as well as the stabilisation of exotic , open crystal structures .",
    "in contrast to their atomic counterparts , soft matter systems can therefore stabilise such crystals without the presence of angle - dependent , anisotropic potentials : radially symmetric , ultrasoft interactions are quite sufficient .",
    "thus , a new _ mean field fluid _ paradigm can be established , which goes beyond the usual prototype for classical fluids , the hard - sphere model .",
    "the latter , being always dominated by packing effects , tends to favour close packed structures .",
    "exotic crystals with unusual ordering have been observed in hard - sphere - like suspensions @xcite but that case refers to _ binary mixtures _ whose phase behaviour is indeed much richer than that of their one - component counterparts .",
