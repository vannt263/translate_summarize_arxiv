    "high purity germanium detectors , hpgeds , are widely used in spectroscopy , for example in the detection of low levels of radioactivity .",
    "they are also used in a wide variety of applications in particle and nuclear physics @xcite . in particular , they are used for gamma ray tracking in arrays like agata @xcite and greta @xcite , and in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay in experiments like gerda @xcite and majorana @xcite .    for some applications ,",
    "the shapes of the electric pulses collected on the electrodes are of interest .",
    "they are used in so called pulse shape analyses which are usually used to obtain information about event topologies .",
    "this can either help in gamma ray tracking @xcite or in identifying background events @xcite .",
    "a fundamental parameter of a pulse is its length .",
    "it can be used to measure the distance of the energy deposit from the electrodes .",
    "its absolute value , however , depends also on the impurity density of the crystal and the relative location of the energy deposit with respect to the crystal axes .",
    "other important factors are the mobilities , @xmath2 , of the charge carriers , electrons and holes , which are temperature , @xmath3 , dependent",
    ".    the mobilities of the charge carriers have been measured in the past .",
    "however , the results , obtained for different samples , do not completely agree @xcite . in principle , the mobilities can be determined by comparing measured to simulated pulses . in practice , this is difficult , because the impurity density distribution of a detector crystal is also not precisely known .",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of the mobilities , can be directly related to the @xmath3 dependence of the pulse lengths .",
    "photon interactions from the 122kev line of a @xmath0eu source were used to select charge depositions close to the outer surface of an n - type cylindrical true - coaxial germanium detector .",
    "holes created close to the surface quickly drift to the mantle electrode and the electrons drifting to the core determine the total length of the pulse .",
    "the holes influence only the first part of the pulse .",
    "pulses were studied separately for interactions close to the crystallographic axes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the detector used was a cylindrical true - coaxial 18fold ( 6@xmath6 , 3@xmath7 ) segmented n - type detector with a height of 70 mm and a diameter of 75 mm .",
    "it was manufactured by canberra france and is similar to the detector previously characterized in detail @xcite .",
    "the inner bore had a diameter of 10 mm .",
    "the density of electrically active impurities was given by the manufacturer as @xmath8 at the top and @xmath9 at the bottom of the detector .",
    "the change in impurities is assumed to be linear with height , @xmath7 .",
    "the operational voltage was 2000v .",
    "the detector was mounted either inside a vacuum cryostat @xcite , k1 , or submerged in a liquid nitrogen volume @xcite , gii . in both cases , a collimated 40kbq @xmath0eu source with a 1@xmath10 beam spot diameter of about 5 mm was used .",
    "the coordinate system used was cylindrical with the origin at the geometric center of the detector and @xmath11 along its crystallographic @xmath4 axis .",
    "the detector @xmath3 inside gii was constantly 77.4k while it was increasing with time inside k1 , where it was cooled via a cooling finger submerged in a liquid nitrogen reservoir .",
    "when the reservoir was not refilled , the detector slowly warmed up .",
    "the temperature , @xmath12 , was monitored with a thermal resistor , pt100 , mounted as close as possible to the detector inside k1 .",
    "the temperature , @xmath3 , of the detector was expected to be higher by @xmath13 between 4  10k .",
    "the following datasets were analysed :    * ds1 : detector operated in gii , submerged in ln2 , @xmath14k ; * ds2 : detector operated in k1 , vacuum , @xmath15k @xmath16k ; * ds3 : detector operated in k1 , vacuum , @xmath17k @xmath18k .",
    "the measurements in k1 were started after the initial cool - down of the setup .",
    "they were performed while the detector was warming up . for ds2 ,",
    "@xmath12 was monitored during breaks in the data taking .",
    "the value of @xmath12 is interpolated for intermediate times . for ds3",
    ", the time dependence of @xmath12 was taken from test warm - ups where @xmath12 was measured in one minute intervals .",
    "figure  [ f : tdev ] shows the temperature development for one measurement of ds2 and two test warm - ups for ds3 , one at the beginning and one at the end of the ds3 data taking .    the absolute value of @xmath12 for ds3 depended on the initial @xmath12 .",
    "the development of @xmath12 with time was however stable .",
    "the @xmath12 could thus be extrapolated from the initial @xmath12 for each measurement cycle .     for one of the measurements of ds2 and two test warm - ups for ds3.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "data were grouped into 15minute intervals . for the analysis , it was assumed that @xmath3 and @xmath12 were constant during these intervals . at the beginning of the measurements in ds3 the steep rise in @xmath12",
    "was excluded .",
    "measurements were taken separately around the @xmath4 axis at @xmath19 and the @xmath5 axis at @xmath20 .",
    "the measurements for ds3 were @xmath21 off axis",
    ". the restrictions of the gii setup did not allow a measurement on the @xmath5 axis .",
    "additional data were taken for cross - checks .",
    "table  [ t : ds ] provides an overview .",
    "the two axes were located in different segments of the detector .",
    "none of the axes was close to a segment boundary .",
    "a schematic of the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : setup ] .",
    ".datasets a1 and a2 , entering the analysis , and c1 and c2 , used for cross checks [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t : p2 ]    the core and segment parameters agree within statistical uncertainties for the datasets a1 and a2 , respectively . however , the parameters for the two axes seem to be significantly different . a cross - check for the @xmath4 axis , using dataset c1 from table  [ t : ds ] ,",
    "did , however , not confirm this .",
    "the parameters should be the same , but they agree better with the parameters of the fit to a2 .",
    "the inclusion of ds2 is what pushes the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 up in the fit to a1 .",
    "as the absolute temperatures for ds2 and ds3 are not known , but have to be fitted , we used this cross - check to estimate the systematic uncertainty on @xmath24 to be @xmath2540mev .",
    "the systematic uncertainty could also be connected to the misalignment present for ds3 , even though such a strong deviation is not expected for a 5@xmath26offset .",
    "another cross - check was performed using the dataset c2 . at that position ,",
    "the drift is not simply radial any more due to the distance from the crystallographic axes ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  fig.3 ) , but the data could still be described by the boltzmann - like @xmath1 .",
    "the fit results for c2 and c1 are compatible .",
    "the fits were further analysed using the program package bat @xcite .",
    "the values listed in table  [ t : p2 ] were confirmed by bat as the global mode .",
    "a detailed study of the probability densities revealed that the inclusion of ds2 causes elongated two - dimensional probablity densities with local minima , also pointing to systematic uncertainties of up to @xmath2540mev for the fits to a1 and a2 .",
    "the probability densities for the fits to c1 and c2 are much more regular , pointing at systematic uncertainties of less than @xmath2520mev .",
    "the drift along the two crystallographic axes were expected to have the same @xmath3 dependence .",
    "the data , independent of fitting procedures , seem to indicate that the @xmath3 dependence of the `` slow axis '' , @xmath4 , is less pronounced . at some @xmath3",
    ", the rise time along the `` fast axis '' , @xmath5 , seems to become as large as along the `` slow axis '' .",
    "a definite conclusion would need better data .",
    "more measurements at more angles and with an improved temperature monitoring are planned .",
    "it should be noted that while the rise times changed with temperature , the amplitudes remained stable , even to the highest temperature of about 130k .",
    "this means that the detector could be operated stably at temperatures well above 100k .",
    "the temperature dependence of the rise time of pulses was studied between 77k and 130k .",
    "the data can not be described by the expected @xmath27 dependence of the charge carrier mobilities .",
    "both core and segment pulses display a boltzmann - like temperature dependence of the rise time .    the significant temperature dependence of the rise time should be taken into account when pulses are simulated for specific experimental setups or used in pulse shape analyses .",
    "it should be noted that the detector used for the investigation could be stably operated up to temperatures of 130k without an observable change in the energy scale ."
