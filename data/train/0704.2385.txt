    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction is unquestionably the most challenging case @xcite , and it might not be resolved in the foreseeable future . however , interactions in other two - hadron systems are worth investigating as well , because new insights into the structural features of already discovered @xcite or yet unknown baryon resonances may emerge . in particular , one may ask if some of those may be understood as hadronic molecules , like the deuteron , or if more compact clusters , like a pentaquark @xcite , may also exist .",
    "we are here interested in pairs of hadrons containing one heavy quark each . in such systems a relative , residual , interaction is a well - defined concept . in the spirit of the born - oppenheimer approximation ,",
    "the ( slow ) heavy quarks serve to define the centers of the two hadrons while the ( fast ) light quarks and gluons provide the physics of the interaction .",
    "exploratory studies along those lines have been done in the context of meson - meson and baryon - baryon systems @xcite .",
    "specifically , we here investigate a heavy - light meson - baryon ( five - quark ) hadron with the quantum numbers of an s - wave @xmath0@xmath1 system .",
    "the heavy - quark propagator is treated in the static approximation .",
    "this allows us to compute the total energy as a function of the relative distance @xmath2 between the heavy quarks , viz .",
    "a production scheme is illustrated in fig .",

    "can be studied using their respective physical reduced masses , provided of course , one is willing to accept the limitations of the adiabatic approximation and the non - relativistic nature of the framework .",
    "this is the main reason for classifying our results as qualitative .",
    "the lattice simulation requires two - hadron interpolating fields . those are constructed using as building blocks standard local operators for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 particles @xcite .",
    "they are placed at relative distance @xmath4 and then projected to total momentum zero @xmath14 here the normalization @xmath15 is the spatial lattice volume , the sums are over lattice sites , and @xmath16 is a dirac spinor index .",
    "then , with @xmath17 the time correlation function @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the relative distance at the source , can be expressed in terms of fermion propagators .",
    "the flavor assignment @xmath20 causes the separable term in ( [ corfun ] ) to vanish .",

    "the final correlator we use is extended from ( [ c ] ) to a @xmath42 matrix by employing several levels @xmath43 of operator smearing .",
    "the procedure amounts to replacing in ( [ op2 ] ) all light - quark fields @xmath44 with smeared fields @xmath45 .",
    "we have used wuppertal - style fermion smearing @xcite along with ape - style gauge field fuzzing @xcite .",
    "the implementation specific to the asymmetric lattice used here is discussed below .",
    "no smearing , nor link variable fuzzing , was done for the heavy , static , quark fields in order to preserve spatial locality , i.e. the @xmath46 factor in ( [ hstatic ] ) .",

    "the expression for @xmath51 in terms of quark propagators still has the form given by ( [ c ] ) , however , light - quark propagator elements are replaced with smeared ones , @xmath52 . smearing and fuzzing prescriptions are the same at source and sink . thus the correlation matrix ( [ ckk ] ) is hermitian by construction .",
    "we choose an asymmetric and anisotropic lattice with geometry @xmath53 .",
    "the bare lattice constants , in the respective directions , satisfy @xmath54 .",
    "subsequently we shall refer to @xmath55 as the lattice constant @xmath56 of the simulation , so the physical volume is @xmath57 .",
    "the lattice has a fine resolution in 4-direction ( time ) , and the same fine resolution in the ( spatial ) 3-direction where the lattice size is twice as long as in the 1,2-directions .",
    "the idea here is to place the static quark sources along the 3-direction and thus achieve a fine spatial resolution of the relative distance as well as to provide enough space to allow for asymptotic separation of the hadrons .",
    "the spatial lattice asymmetry leads us to modify the procedure for operator smearing .",
    "a smearing iteration of @xmath58 steps is understood to mean @xmath58 steps in the 1,2-directions but @xmath59 steps in the 3-direction , so the physical smearing extent is the same for all spatial directions ( neglecting renormalization effects ) .",
    "mutatis mutandis , the same is true for gauge field fuzzing .",

    "we have therefore used the standard wilson plaquette action with wilson fermions in a quenched simulation @xcite .",
    "the gauge field couplings in the @xmath50-@xmath64 planes and the hopping parameters in directions @xmath50 are given by , respectively , @xmath65 the simulation was done at @xmath66 with four values @xmath67 of the hopping parameter employing a multiple mass solver @xcite .",
    "a total of 343 gauge field configurations were used .",
    "the time evolution of the eigenvalues of @xmath68 determines the energy spectrum .",
    "eigenvalues , behaving exponentially with @xmath69 , may rapidly vanish into numerical noise .",
    "conventional diagonalization methods do not work well under those circumstances .",
    "singular value decomposition ( svd ) , on the other hand , is ideally suited to the task @xcite .",
    "the svd reads @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are unitary in our case , and @xmath73 contains the singular values satisfying @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath68 is non - degenerate and positive semi - definite then the set of singular values @xmath75 and the set of eigenvalues are the same .",
    "a few more details can be found in @xcite . for simplicity we will refer to @xmath76 as eigenvalues .",
    "to extract energy levels from the eigenvalues an often used procedure , sometimes starting from a generalized eigenvalue problem @xcite , is to construct effective mass functions from the eigenvalues and then try to identify plateaus in the asymptotic time region .",
    "typically , only a narrow subset of the time slices is usable , which also is subject to some discretion .",
    "we shall not rely on effective mass functions here , but rather analyze correlator eigenvalues by means of the maximum entropy method @xcite following the adaption described in @xcite , and in @xcite . among the advantages",
    "are that all available time slices may be used , if desired , and that excited states , if present , are easily revealed .",

    "in practice the large-@xmath69 rule means that , in each eigen channel , one should only take the lowest peak into account . in physical terms",
    "the secondary peaks are separated from those by @xmath1033gev , and larger , and thus should probably be considered lattice artifacts .    in order to relate our results to the physical hadron spectrum we have also computed @xmath86 correlation matrices with standard local @xcite",

    "we use the extrapolation model introduced in @xcite @xmath107 and @xmath108 . for a motivation of the same we refer the reader to said reference .",
