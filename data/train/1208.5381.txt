    "quantum entanglement is at the heart of the current development of quantum information and quantum computation [ 1 ] .",
    "it is a special quantum correlation and has been recognized as an important resource in quantum information processing [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "the experimental demonstrations of two - particle entanglement and multi - particle entanglement in the cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) have been reported [ 5 , 6 ] . some applications which focus on the entanglement or the nonclassical correlations",
    "have also been realized in recent experiments [ 7 - 10 ] .    however , the entanglement is not the only type of quantum correlation and there exist quantum tasks that display quantum advantage without entanglement [ 11 - 14 ] .",
    "it has been demonstrated both theoretically [ 15 - 17 ] and experimentally [ 18 ] that other nonclassical correlation , namely , quantum discord [ 19 ] can be responsible for the computational speedup for certain quantum tasks .",
    "quantum discord , introduced in [ 19 ] , is defined as the difference between the quantum mutual information and the classical correlation and is nonzero even for separate mixed states .",
    "therefore , the quantum discord may be regarded as a more general and fundamental resource in quantum information processing .",
    "recently , the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord for some open systems has attracted much attention [ 20 - 25 ] .",
    "it has been shown that the quantum discord can be completely unaffected by certain decoherence environment during an initial time interval [ 22 ] and this phenomenon has been verified by the recent experiment [ 23 ]",
    ".    the interaction between the environment and quantum system of interest can destroy quantum coherence and lead to decoherence .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to prevent or minimize the influence of environmental noise in the practical realization of quantum information processing .",
    "one of the protocols to prevent the quantum decoherence is dynamical decoupling strategies [ 26 - 28 ] by means of a train of instantaneous pulses(``bang - bang '' pulses ) .",
    "recently , experimental suppression of polarization decoherence in a ring cavity using bang - bang decoupling technique has also been reported [ 29 ] .    in this letter",
    ", we propose a scheme of increasing quantum correlations for the cavity quantum electrodynamics system consisting of two noninteracting two - level atoms interacting with their own quantized field mode [ 25 ] by means of a train of instantaneous pulses .",
    "the two atoms are initially prepared in the extended werner - like states(ewl ) [ 30 ] and the cavity fields are prepared in the fock states or thermal states .",
    "we investigate how the bang - bang pulses affect the dynamics of quantum discord , entanglement , quantum mutual information and classical correlation between the two atoms .",
    "it is found that the amount of quantum discord and entanglement of the two atom can be improved by applying the bang - bang pulses , because the increased amount of quantum mutual information is greater than classical correlation by the bang - bang pulses .",
    "in this section we investigate the dynamical evolution for the cavity quantum electrodynamics system consisting of two noninteracting two - level atoms each locally interacting with its own quantized field mode with bang - bang pulses .",
    "the hamiltonian of one atom interacting with its own quantized field mode with bang - bang pulses is given by @xmath0 with @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the annihilation and creation operators for the cavity field and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the atomic operators .",
    "@xmath7 is the hamiltonian for a train of identical pulses of duration @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the time interval between two consecutive pulses and the amplitude @xmath11 of the control field is specified to be @xmath12 , which means that we consider the @xmath13-pulse only .",
    "it is not difficult to write down the time evolution operator in the absence of control pulses field directly as @xmath14 $ ] . with the help of an @xmath15 dynamical algebraic structure [ 31 ]",
    ", we can rewrite the time evolution operator as @xmath16-i\\frac{\\sin[\\omega(k)t]}{\\omega(k)}[\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\sigma_z+\\nonumber\\\\ \\quad g(\\sigma_+a+\\sigma_-a^\\dag)]\\}\\exp[-i\\omega(k-\\frac{1}{2})t],\\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a constant of motion in the hamiltonia , @xmath18 denotes detuning given by @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . when the control pulses field is present , the time evolution operator for the duration @xmath8 is given by @xmath21.\\ ] ] for the case that the pulses are strong enough , i.e. the duration @xmath22 , this time evolution operator reduces to @xmath23,\\ ] ] which leads to @xmath24.\\ ] ]    the time evolution operator of an elementary cycle between @xmath25 and @xmath26 is described by the unitary operator @xmath27 if we focus on the stroboscopic evolution at times @xmath28 , the evolution is driven by an effective average hamiltonian [ 26 ] @xmath29^n=\\exp[-ih_{eff}t_{2n}].\\ ] ] if @xmath10 is sufficiently short , then the effective hamiltonian is accurately represented by the following hamiltonian @xmath30 the coupling parameter @xmath31 is proportional to the detuning @xmath18 and the time interval @xmath10 between two successive pulses .",
    "obviously , the interaction between the atom and field is averaged to zero by the `` bang - bang '' pulses when @xmath32 .",
    "with the help of the @xmath15 algebraic structure as before , the evolution operator at times @xmath28 can be expressed as @xmath33-i\\frac{\\sin[\\omega_{eff}(k)t_{2n}]}{\\omega_{eff}(k)}[\\frac{\\delta}{2}\\sigma_z-\\nonumber\\\\ \\quad ig_{eff}(\\sigma_+a-\\sigma_-a^\\dag)]\\}\\exp[-i\\omega(k-\\frac{1}{2})t_{2n}],\\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",

    "2 that the quantum discord between the two atoms can be enhanced by the pulses because the increased amount of quantum mutual information is always larger than the classical correlation and the quantum discord recovers to its initial value at the points @xmath28 when the detuning @xmath128 . the increased amount of the quantum correlations is larger for shorter time intervals @xmath10 of the control pulses .",
    "it is worth pointing out that different choices of @xmath55 and @xmath56 do not give dynamics of quantum correlations qualitatively different from the case treated here .",
    "focusing on the evolution at times @xmath28 , the quantum discord fluctuates with period @xmath129 for the case of the detuning @xmath130 , as displayed in fig .",
    "3(a ) and the amplitudes are independent from the detuning @xmath18 .",
    "when the cavity fields are prepared in the fock states , similar results are found for sufficiently short time intervals between two consecutive pulses .",

    "in fact , from eqs . ( 11 ) , ( 21 ) and ( 31 ) , the quantum discord displayed in fig .",
    "3 can be given by @xmath135 for small @xmath10 .",
    "this expression is in accord with fig .",

    "4 as a function of time @xmath58 for different intervals of control pulses .",
    "we find that both the concurrence and quantum discord can be enhanced by applying the bang - bang control pulses .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the phenomenon of esd may disappear if the time interval @xmath10 of the control pulses is sufficiently short .",
    "when the cavity modes are prepared initially in the thermal states , the quantum discord between the two atoms can also be enhanced by the pulses with short time interval as shown in fig .",
    "the changes of quantum discord with different time intervals of the control pulses are synchronous as the same period as the fig .",
    "however , different from the case of vacuum states , the maximums of quantum discord are decreasing slightly with time .",
    "they decrease more slowly for shorter time intervals @xmath10 of the control pulses .",
    "in this paper , we propose a scheme of increasing quantum correlations for the cavity quantum electrodynamics system consisting of two noninteracting two - level atoms each locally interacting with its own quantized field mode by making use of bang - bang pulses .",
    "the two atoms are initially prepared in the ewl states and the cavity fields are prepared in the fock states or thermal states .",
    "it is found that the amount of quantum discord and entanglement of two atom can be enhanced by applying the bang - bang pulses and the increased amount is larger for shorter time intervals of the control pulses .",
    "particularly , the phenomenon of esd may disappear if the time interval @xmath10 of the control pulses is sufficiently short .",
    "in addition , the quantum correlations recover to their initial values at the points @xmath28 when the detuning @xmath128 .",
    "the values of quantum discord at times @xmath28 fluctuates with period @xmath129 for the case of the detuning @xmath130 and the amplitude is smaller for the pulses with shorter time intervals @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth noting that the pulses used in this paper are also suitable to the system with the hamiltonian of interaction has the form of @xmath137(here @xmath138 and @xmath139 are any operators of the cavity field or reservoir ) .",
