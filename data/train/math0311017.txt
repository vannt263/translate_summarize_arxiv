    "<S> we provide a characterization of the radii minimal projections of polytopes onto @xmath0-dimensional subspaces in euclidean space @xmath1 . applied on simplices this characterization allows to reduce the computation of an outer radius to a computation in the circumscribing case or to the computation of an outer radius of a lower - dimensional simplex . in the second part of the paper </S>",
    "<S> , we use this characterization to determine the sequence of outer @xmath2-radii of regular simplices ( which are the radii of smallest enclosing cylinders ) . </S>",
    "<S> this settles a question which arose from the incidence that a paper by weibach ( 1983 ) on this determination was erroneous . in the proof , </S>",
    "<S> we first reduce the problem to a constrained optimization problem of symmetric polynomials and then to an optimization problem in a fixed number of variables with additional integer constraints . </S>"
