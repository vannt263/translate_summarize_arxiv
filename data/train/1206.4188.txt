    "for @xmath181 the constraints are weakened as in the negative @xmath0 case .",
    "however as @xmath1 becomes more negative the constraints quickly become tighter again . in the limit of very large @xmath1",
    "the constraints are independent of its sign and very tight , approximately the cube of the constraints in the gaussian case .",
    "we have also studied and plotted the probability distribution functions , showing that although the pdfs can diverge , all physical quantities , such as the pbh abundance , remain finite .",
    "the pbh constraints have previously been calculated for a pure @xmath182 pdf  @xcite and for quadratic non - gaussianity in the limits that @xmath180 and the linear term dominates  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that we recover these limiting cases , however , of particular significance is the fact that our calculations are valid for arbitrarily large quadratic and cubic local non - gaussianity .",
    "a bispectrum in the squeezed limit is in general generated by all single field models of inflation , with an amplitude which is related to the spectral index by @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "although this value is too small to be seen on cmb scales , it might be important on pbh scales , since firstly the spectral index might be larger as the slow - roll parameters potentially become larger towards the end of inflation and secondly since the constraints are sensitive to smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "an important issue , which goes beyond the scope of this work , is the calculation of the secondary non - gaussianities generated through the effects of gravity being non - linear and through horizon re - entry after inflation , during which time @xmath6 is no longer conserved .",
    "these calculations have been carried out on cmb scales and these effects generally cause an order of unity change to the non - linearity parameters ( although the effect is scale dependent )  @xcite .",
    "such small values of the non - linear parameters can have a significant effect on the number of pbh s formed , therefore it would be interesting to carry out a similar analysis valid for the much smaller scales on which pbh s form . if these effects generically lead to @xmath184 then this would suggest that pbh s are unlikely to have formed , unless inflation generated a larger and positive primordial @xmath0 on the same scales . the current calculation",
    "could also be extended by allowing for simultaneous non - zero values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 or by studying the effects of higher order non - linearity parameters .",
    "the possibility of pbh formation constrains both the amplitude and degree of non - gaussianity associated with the primordial density perturbations over a wide range of scales , smaller than those probed by cosmological observations . in this paper",
    "we have shown that even relatively small values of the non - linearity parameters , of order unity , can have a significant effect on the pbh constraints on the amplitude of the primordial perturbations . therefore non - gaussianity should be taken into account when calculating pbh constraints on inflation models .",
    "we have also shown that the observation of pbh s would rule out non - negligible negative @xmath0 , re - emphasizing the constraining power of pbh s .",
