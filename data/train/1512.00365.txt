    "the introduction to this paper is in two parts .",
    "the first subsection defines resonance and gives our prototypical example on alternating sign matrices .",
    "the second subsection describes our main results ; these include two instances of resonance ( on plane partitions and increasing tableaux ) , an equivariant bijection between these two sets with a number of new consequences , and a higher - dimensional analogue of n.  williams and the third author s result on the equivariance of ( poset-)promotion and rowmotion  @xcite .",
    "we introduce the following concept of _ _",
    "resonance__.    suppose @xmath2 is a cyclic group acting on a set @xmath3 , @xmath4 a cyclic group of order @xmath5 acting nontrivially on a set @xmath6 , and @xmath7 a surjection .",
    "we say the triple @xmath8 exhibits * resonance with frequency @xmath5 * if , for all @xmath9 , @xmath10 , that is , the following diagram commutes :    \\(a ) @xmath3 ; ( b ) @xmath3 ; ( c ) @xmath6 ; ( d ) @xmath6 ; ( a ) edge[pil ] node[below]@xmath11 ( b ) ; ( a ) edge[pil ] node[right]@xmath12 ( c ) ; ( b ) edge[pil ] node[right]@xmath12 ( d ) ; ( c ) edge[pil ] node[below]@xmath13 ( d ) ;    in our examples , @xmath6 will be either a set of planar diagrams with @xmath14 acting by rotation or a set of words with @xmath14 acting by a cyclic shift .",
    "resonance is a _ pseudo - periodicity _ property of the @xmath15-action , in that the resonant frequency @xmath5 is generally less than the order of the @xmath15-action .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath16 satisfies the definition of resonance with frequency @xmath17 ; we call this an instance of _ trivial resonance_. our prototypical example of resonance is the action of _ gyration _ on _ alternating sign matrices_.    an * alternating sign matrix ( asm ) * is a square matrix with the following properties : the entries are in the set @xmath18 , each row and each column sums to one , and the nonzero entries along each row or column alternate in sign .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the set of @xmath20 alternating sign matrices .",
    "alternating sign matrices were introduced by d.  robbins  h .  rumsey @xcite as part of their study of the lambda - determinant . with w.  mills",
    "@xcite , they then conjectured an enumeration for @xmath19 , which was proved by d.  zeilberger  @xcite and g.  kuperberg  @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a detailed exposition of this history ) .",
    "alternating sign matrices are known to be in bijection with _ fully - packed loop configurations _",

    "[ def : fpl ] consider an @xmath21 \\times [ n]$ ] grid of dots in @xmath22 .",
    "beginning with the dot at the upper left corner , draw an edge from that dot up one unit .",
    "then go around the grid , drawing such an external edge at every second dot ( counting corner dots twice , since at the corners , external edges could go in either of two directions ) . a * fully - packed loop configuration ( fpl ) * of order",
    "@xmath1 is a set of paths and loops on the @xmath21 \\times [ n]$ ] grid with boundary conditions as described above , such that each of the @xmath23 vertices within the grid has exactly two incident edges .",
    "there is a ( non - injective ) map from fully - packed loop configurations to their _ link patterns_.    [ def : lp ] given a fully - packed loop configuration , number the external edges clockwise , starting with the upper left external edge .",
    "each external edge will be connected by a path to another external edge , and these paths will never cross . this matching on the external edges is a noncrossing matching on @xmath24 points , and is called the * link pattern * of the fpl .",
    "consider the following action on fully - packed loop configurations .",
    "[ def : fplgyr ] given an @xmath21\\times[n]$ ] grid of dots , color the interiors of the squares in a checkerboard pattern . given an fpl of order @xmath1 drawn on this grid , its * gyration * , gyr ,",
    "is computed by first visiting all squares of one color then all squares of the other color , applying at each visited square the `` local move '' that swaps the edges around a square if the edges are parallel and otherwise leaves them fixed .    the following theorem of b.  wieland gives a remarkable property of gyration .",
    "gyration of an fpl rotates the associated link pattern by an angle of @xmath25 .",
    "we reformulate this theorem into a statement of resonance .",
    "let @xmath12 be the map from an alternating sign matrix through its fpl to the link pattern . then , @xmath26 exhibits resonance with frequency @xmath24 .    for example , consider gyration on @xmath27 alternating sign matrices . gyration has orbits of size 2 , 4 , 5 , and 10 .",
    "so the order of gyration in this case is 20 , but @xmath28 , gyr , @xmath29 exhibits resonance with frequency @xmath30 .",
    "consider the orbit of gyration in figure  [ fig : fplex ] .",
    "this orbit is of size 4 , while the link pattern orbit is of size 2 .",

    "@xmath41     asm with gyration orbit of length 84 , with its corresponding fpl and link pattern ]    we think of the property of resonance as somewhat analogous to the _ cyclic sieving phenomenon _ ( introduced by v.  reiner  d .",

    "we suspect that the phenomenon of resonance , like those of cyclic sieving and homomesy , is significantly more common than previously realized .",
    "heuristically , one is led to suspect the presence of resonance in a system by observing that many orbit cardinalities are multiples or divisors ( or multiples of divisors ) of @xmath5 .      the remainder of this paper centers around two new examples of resonance on _ plane partitions _ under _ rowmotion _ and _ increasing tableaux _ under _ @xmath0-promotion _ , as well as a new equivariant bijection relating these phenomena . here",
