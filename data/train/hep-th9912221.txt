    "this contribution focuses on two applications discovered during the last two years of the hopf algebra of rooted trees .",
    "they suggest an amazing link between mathematics and physics .",
    "there exists an excellent review @xcite of these topics , written by the authors of these ideas . in what follows i am going to explain parts of this development which i was able to understand .",
    "i hope it can be useful to somebody else .    in mathematics ,",
    "foliations provide a large class of examples of noncommutative spaces and lead to an index problem for the transverse hypoelliptic operator @xcite .",
    "the computation of the cocycles in the local index formula turned out to be extremely lengthy even in dimension one .",
    "alain connes and henri moscovici @xcite were looking for an organizing principle for that calculation , which they found in the cyclic cohomology of a hopf algebra @xmath0 obtained by the action of vector fields on a crossed product of functions by diffeomorphisms .    concerning physics , dirk kreimer @xcite discovered that a perturbative quantum field theory carries in a natural way a hopf algebra structure @xmath1 given by operations on feynman graphs .",
    "the antipode reproduces precisely the combinatorics of renormalization , i.e.  it produces the local counterterms to make the divergent integral corresponding to the feynman graph finite .    noticing that both hopf algebras have formally a very similar structure",
    ", connes and kreimer gave the precise relation @xcite between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is very transparent in the language of rooted trees they used .",
    "the commutative hopf subalgebra @xmath4 of connes ",
    "moscovici is ( in dimension 1 ) a hopf subalgebra of kreimer s hopf algebra for a quantum field theory with a single primitively divergent graph .",
    "recently it was pointed out @xcite that the same algebra of rooted trees plays a role in runge  kutta methods of numerical analysis .",
    "in principle , the hopf algebra of connes and moscovici can be understood from classical differential geometry @xcite . we give here a somewhat shortened version of the derivation and refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "we recommend @xcite for a useful introduction to hopf algebras and related topics .",
    "we regard the frame bundle @xmath5 of a manifold @xmath6 and in particular the vector fields on @xmath5 .",
    "there is a natural notion of vertical vector fields , these are the tangent vectors to curves in @xmath5 obtained by the right action of the group @xmath7 of @xmath8 matrices with positive determinant .",
    "the horizontal vector fields are not canonically given , they are determined once a connection is specified . for our purpose",
    "we can work in local coordinates .",
    "let @xmath9 be the coordinates of @xmath10 within a local chart of @xmath6 and @xmath11 be the coordinates of @xmath12 linearly independent vectors of the tangent space @xmath13 with respect to the basis @xmath14 .",
    "on @xmath5 there exist the following geometrical objects , written in terms of the local coordinates @xmath15 of @xmath16 :    * an @xmath17-valued ( soldering ) @xmath18-form @xmath19 with @xmath20 * a @xmath21-valued ( connection ) @xmath18-form @xmath22 with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 depends only on @xmath25 * @xmath26 vertical vector fields @xmath27 * @xmath12 horizontal ( with respect to @xmath22 ) vector fields @xmath28    a local diffeomorphism @xmath29 of @xmath6 has a lift @xmath30 to the frame bundle and induces the following transformations of the previous geometrical objects :    * @xmath31 * @xmath32 is again a connection form , with + @xmath33 * @xmath34 * @xmath35 is horizontal to @xmath36    we refer to @xcite for the proof .    given these tools of classical differential geometry , the new idea is to apply the vector fields @xmath37 to a crossed product @xmath38 of the algebra of smooth functions on @xmath5 with compact support by the action of the pseudogroup @xmath39 of local diffeomorphisms of @xmath6 . as a set , @xmath40 can be regarded as the tensor product of @xmath41 with @xmath39 .",
    "it is generated by the monomials @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the diffeomorphism of @xmath5 obtained as the lift of @xmath44 . as an algebra ,",
    "the multiplication rule in @xmath40 is defined by @xmath45 here , the function @xmath46 evaluated at @xmath47 ( in the domain of definition ) gives @xmath48 , i.e.  we have a non - local product on the function algebra .",
    "the action of vector fields on @xmath40 is defined as the action on the function part .",
    "interesting is the application to the product ( [ prod ] ) , because the non - locality in the function part leads to a deviation from the leibniz rule . for @xmath49",
    "being a vector field on @xmath5 one computes @xmath50 since diffeomorphisms and right group action commute , we get the unchanged leibniz rule for the vertical vector fields , @xmath51 for the horizontal vector fields , however , there will be an additional term @xmath52 . comparing @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "above we have @xmath56 , for some function @xmath57 . using ( [ prod ] ) we commute this function in front of @xmath58 and obtain @xmath59 the operator @xmath60 on @xmath40 is computed to @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the connection coefficients belonging to @xmath63 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath60 is a derivation : @xmath64    these formulae can now be interpreted in the dual sense , for instance @xmath65 , which leads to a structure of a coalgebra on the linear space @xmath66 , @xmath67 with @xmath18 being the identity on @xmath40 .",
    "coassociativity @xmath68 is easy to check .",
    "vector fields form a lie algebra , so the next step is to ask whether @xmath66 close under the lie bracket .",
    "the first commutators are ok , @xmath69 ( fu^*_\\psi ) & = & ( \\delta^i_l y^k_j - \\delta^k_j y^i_l )   ( fu^*_\\psi)~ , \\nonumber \\\\   { } [ y^k_j , x_i ]",

    "therefore , one uses a different strategy and considers instead of @xmath40 a _",
    "morita equivalent _ algebra @xmath73 based on a _ flat _",
    "manifold @xmath74  the disjoint union of the charts @xmath75 of @xmath6 .",
    "now , there is neither curvature nor torsion , and horizontal vector fields commute .",
    "there remain the commutators of @xmath76 with @xmath77 , which lead indeed to new generators of the lie algebra : @xmath78\\dots ] ( f u^*_\\psi )   \\label{flat } \\\\",

    "now having established a lie algebra , we call @xmath80 its enveloping algebra , i.e.  the algebra of polynomials in @xmath81 , with the commutation relations inherited from the lie algebra . with the coproduct @xmath82 on the lie algebra",
    ", @xmath80 becomes automatically a bialgebra , where the coproduct is defined via the algebra homomorphism axiom : @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "the counit @xmath85 is defined by @xmath86 the counit axiom @xmath87 is straightforward to check .",
    "there also exists an antipode on @xmath80 which makes it to a hopf algebra .",
    "the antipode is the unique antiautomorphism of @xmath80 satisfying @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and where @xmath90 denotes the multiplication . from the second line and ( [ delta ] ) one easily obtains @xmath91",
    "the action of @xmath92 on the other generators of @xmath80 can be derived from ( [ sax ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this hopf algebra @xmath80 is to ease the computation @xcite of cocycles in the local index formula @xcite of connes and moscovici .",
    "so far i did not study this calculation for myself , but i think a good way to learn it would be to consult @xcite .",
    "coproduct and antipode for the generators @xmath93 are only recursively defined via the axioms of coproduct and antipode .",
    "now we are going to present an explicit solution  via the concept of rooted trees .",
    "this was introduced by connes and kreimer @xcite to clarify the relation between the two hopf algebras in the theory of foliations and in perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "we generalize @xcite their construction from dimension 1 to arbitrary dimension of the manifold @xmath6 . to the first three classes of @xmath77 s we associate the following trees : @xmath94 the rule is obvious . a symbol @xmath95",
    ", for @xmath96 a string of @xmath97 indices , is obtained from @xmath98 by attaching to each of its trees @xmath99 a new vertex with label @xmath100 successively to the right of each vertex .",
    "the root ( with three indices ) remains the same and order is important .",
    "coproduct and antipode require the definition of cuts of a tree .",
    "an elementary cut along a chosen edge splits a tree into two  the trees above ( trunk ) and below ( cut branch ) the cut .",
    "it is clear that we have to add 2 indices to complete the root of the cut branch .",
    "this will be a pair of summation indices .",
    "we define the action of a cut as the shift of one index of the vertex above the cut to the first position of the new root of the cut branch . the remaining position to complete the root of the cut branch",
    "is filled with a summation index and the same summation index is put into the vacant position of the trunk . in the case of cutting immediately below the root , we have to sum over the three possibilities of picking up indices of the root , adding a minus sign if we pick up the unique upper index .",
    "the following examples illustrate the definition of a cut , where we write the trunk as the rhs of the tensor product and the cut branch as the lhs : @xmath101 a multiple cut consists of several elementary cuts , where _ the order of cuts is from top to bottom and from left to right_. an _ admissible _ cut is a multiple cut such that on the path from any vertex to the root there is at most one elementary cut .",
    "the product of all cut branches forms the lhs of the tensor product , whereas the trunk alone containing the old root serves as the rhs .",
    "the purpose of these definitions is to give an explicit formula for coproduct and antipode .",
    "indeed , by induction one can prove the following :    the coproduct of @xmath102 is given by @xmath103 where for each @xmath104 the sum is over all admissible cuts @xmath105 of @xmath104 . in eq .",
    "( [ pr ] ) , @xmath106 is the trunk and @xmath107 the product of cut branches obtained by cutting @xmath104 via the multiple cut @xmath105 .",
    "_ we start from @xmath108   = \\delta^k_{ji , a\\ell } \\otimes 1 + 1 \\otimes \\delta^k_{ji , a\\ell } + r^k_{ji , a\\ell}~ ,   \\\\",
    "r^k_{ji , a\\ell } & = & [ x_\\ell \\otimes 1 + 1 \\otimes x_\\ell   , r^k_{ji , a } ]   + [ \\delta^m_{n\\ell } \\otimes y^n_m , r^k_{ji , a } + ( 1 \\otimes   \\delta^k_{ji , a } ) ] \\in \\mathcal{h } \\otimes \\mathcal{h}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by definition of the tree , the commutator with @xmath109 attaches a vertex @xmath100 successively to all previous vertices , where @xmath110 attaches to the cut branches and @xmath111 attaches to the trunk .",
    "next , the commutator with @xmath112 puts for each vertex of the trunk ( due to the commutator with @xmath113 ) a cut branch consisting of a single vertex to the lhs of the tensor product . both contributions together yield precisely all admissible cuts of the trees corresponding to @xmath95 .",
    "1ex    the antipode is obtained by applying the antipode axiom @xmath114 to ( [ pr ] ) . by recursion one",
    "proves    the antipode @xmath92 of @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 where the sum is over the set of all non - empty multiple cuts @xmath117 of @xmath104 ( multiple cuts on paths from bottom to the root are allowed ) consisting of @xmath118 individual cuts .",
    "in a perturbative quantum field theory it is convenient to symbolize contributions to green s functions by feynman graphs .",
    "these feynman graphs stand for analytic expressions of momentum variables .",
    "internal momentum variables have to be integrated out .",
    "very often some of these integrations formally yield infinity .",
    "the art of obtaining meaningful results out of these integrals is called renormalization . a central problem is the existence of subdivergences which can not be regularized by a simple subtraction of the divergent part .",
    "bogoliubov @xcite found a recursion formula for the regularization of feynman graphs with subdivergences and zimmermann gave an explicit solution  the forest formula @xcite .    in 1997",
    "dirk kreimer discovered @xcite that there is the structure of a hopf algebra behind this art of renormalization , with the combinatorics of the forest formula produced by the antipode .",
    "kreimer s idea was to visualize the divergence structure of feynman graphs in terms of parenthesized words , which are in 1:1 correspondence to rooted trees @xcite .",
    "let us exemplify this idea by a feynman graph from qed : @xmath119 straight lines stand for fermions and wavy lines for bosons , and the boxes contain divergent sectors .",
    "a criterion for superficial divergence of a region confined in a box is power counting .",
    "if a box has @xmath120 bosonic and @xmath121 fermionic outgoing legs , the power counting degree of divergence @xmath122 is ( in four dimensions ) defined by @xmath123 .",
    "owing to symmetries the actual degree of divergence of one graph or a sum of graphs can be lower than @xmath122 , see @xcite .",
    "the construction of the rooted tree from the feynman graphs with identified divergent sectors is clear : the outermost ( superficial ) divergence @xmath124 is the root @xmath125 .",
    "the box @xmath124 contains the boxes @xmath126 and @xmath127 as immediate subdivergences , hence we connect two vertices @xmath128 and @xmath129 directly to the root @xmath125 .",
    "the box @xmath127 contains the subdivergences @xmath130 and @xmath131 , so we attach the vertices @xmath132 and @xmath133 to @xmath129 .",
    "this works as long as there are no overlapping divergences , which must be resolved before in terms of disjoint and nested ones and lead to a sum of rooted trees @xcite .",
    "having identified the trees to feynman graphs , it are the same cutting operations on trees as before which give us coproduct and antipode . here , a cut splits a feynman graph into several subgraphs  a standard operation in renormalization .",
    "it is very remarkable that the antipode obtained in this way reproduces the combinatorics of renormalization @xcite .",
    "these surprising facts have been extended to a complete renormalization of a toy model @xcite , which we review in the next section .",
    "before , let us ask an interesting question : what is the role of the operators @xmath134 in quantum field theory , and what is the meaning of the individual trees for diffeomorphisms ?",
    "i am not aware of an answer , but there is an interesting observation @xcite concerning the relation of the _ decorated _ rooted trees ( [ tree ] ) to feynman graphs . the trees emerging from the connes  moscovici hopf algebra are decorated by spacetime indices ( three for the root ) whereas in qft the decoration is a label for divergent feynman graphs without subdivergences .",
    "although the operators @xmath77 are invariant under permutation of the indices after the comma , for instance @xmath135 , see ( [ flat ] ) , this symmetry is lost on the level of individual trees .",
    "that leads us to speculate that _ the sum of feynman graphs according to the collection of rooted trees to @xmath77 s has more symmetry than the individual feynman graphs .",
    "_ this should be checked in qft calculations .",
    "another interpretation would be the observation from ( [ tree ] ) @xmath136 which could possibly be regarded as a relation between feynman graphs similar to those derived in @xcite .",
    "according to a private communication by kreimer , ( [ rel ] ) is satisfied in qft for the leading divergences , as it can be derived from sec .",
    "v.c in @xcite . for non - leading singularities",
    "there will be ( probably systematic ) modifications .    in mathematics , connes and kreimer",
    "extended the investigation of the commutative hopf subalgebra @xmath4 in @xcite to the level of individual trees @xcite .",
    "they showed that the hopf algebra of rooted trees @xmath3 is the solution of a universal problem in hochschild cohomology .",
    "we recall @xcite that @xmath4 is the dual of the enveloping algebra of the lie algebra @xmath137 of formal vector fields on @xmath138 vanishing to order 2 at the origin , and that @xmath4 itself is isomorphic to the hopf algebra of coordinates on the group of diffeomorphisms of @xmath138 of the form @xmath139 . by analogy",
    ", connes and kreimer regard @xmath140 as the hopf algebra of coordinates on a nilpotent formal group @xmath141 whose lie algebra @xmath142 they succeed to compute .",
    "this group was recently found to be related to the butcher group in numerical analysis @xcite .",
    "it will certainly contain precious information for quantum field theory because the antipode in @xmath3 governing renormalization is the dual of the inversion operation in @xmath141 .",
    "renormalization seems to provide a new mathematical calculus which generalizes differential calculi .",
    "in the spirit of kreimer @xcite we are going to give the reader a feeling for renormalization by considering a toy model .",
    "the toy model is given by iterated divergent integrals , in close analogy to qft .",
    "the only difference is that the integrals are very simple to compute .",
    "let us take the integral @xmath143 which diverges logarithmically for @xmath144 .",
    "we can regard it as the analytic expression to the feynman graph @xmath145 to a feynman graph with subdivergence there corresponds an iterated integral : @xmath146 clearly , these iterated integrals form a hopf algebra of rooted trees without side branches , and the coproduct is given by the admissible cuts of the trees .",
    "the renormalization of these integrals requires an algebra homomorphisms @xmath147 on iterated integrals , which represents a certain way of evaluation under `` a set of conditions @xmath58 '' . for our purpose",
    "we take @xmath148 the evaluation of the integrals at @xmath149 . in qft",
    ", @xmath58 should be regarded as an energy scale , and @xmath147 evaluates the feynman graphs at this scale .",
    "the essential idea @xcite is now to consider the _",
    "convolution product _ of these homomorphisms , defined via the hopf algebra structure : @xmath150 the antipode axiom can be written in the compact form @xmath151 .",
    "it is however more interesting to consider the following modification : @xmath152 due to the hopf algebra properties , the @xmath153 satisfy a groupoid law .",
    "we give the derivation in full detail , using 1 ) associativity of @xmath90 and coassociativity of @xmath82 , 2 ) the antipode axiom , 3 ) homomorphism property of @xmath154 , 4 ) @xmath155 , 5 ) the counit axiom : @xmath156    we apply now the @xmath153 operation to the divergent integrals to compute @xmath157 : @xmath158 the result @xmath159 is finite for @xmath144 and vanishes for @xmath160 .",
    "we proceed with the next integral , using the definition of @xmath82 as given by the admissible cuts and @xmath92 as given by all cuts ( with sign from the number of elementary cuts ) of the graphs : @xmath161 again , the result is finite .",
    "note that in @xmath162 the root which stands for the @xmath163 integration is the right vertex and hence is evaluated at @xmath164 .",
    "the computation for @xmath165 is left as an exercise .    from the identity @xmath166 and the coproduct rule given by admissible cuts of a tree without side branches we get chen s lemma @xcite : @xmath167 for @xmath168 it reads @xmath169    the purpose of these considerations was the renormalization of a qft .",
    "let us assume a theory where all contributions to the coupling constant come from the following ladder diagrams : @xmath170 formally , this series evaluates to infinity , but this infinity can be renormalized to a finite but _ undetermined _ value . that value has to be adapted to experiment and yields a _",
    "normalization condition_. at some energy scale @xmath58 we are allowed to fix the coupling constant @xmath171 . but",
    "suppose we measure now the value of the coupling constant at another energy scale @xmath172 .",
    "the normalization condition is fixed so that in the diagrams we have to use in all vertices the normalized coupling constant @xmath173 . since the renormalization removing the infinities was scale dependent",
    ", the loop diagrams @xmath174 now give a contribution , and this contribution is precisely @xmath175 .",
    "hence , @xmath176 assuming the series converges , we get a finite shift of the coupling constant . in realistic quantum field theories ,",
    "the agreement of this value with experiment is overwhelming . in particular , in first order we recover the familiar logarithmic energy dependence of the coupling constant .",
    "we also learn from ( [ ren ] ) that one can completely avoid talking about infinities .",
    "as it is clear from our model , the running coupling constants resulting from renormalization are governed by the hopf algebra structure together with the convolution product .",
    "the hopf algebra structure not only produces the combinatorics of the forest formula , it also allows to compare different renormalization schemes , which arise from each other by a finite re - normalization .",
    "the theory is consistent without a preferred scale or preferred renormalization scheme .",
    "they are always related by the convolution identity @xmath177 , where @xmath178 stand for parameterizations of different renormalization schemes .",
    "applications of these ideas to qft calculations are starting @xcite .",
    "i am grateful to the organizers of the hesselberg99 conference , florian scheck , harald upmeier and wend werner , for the invitation and the possibility to present these ideas .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank my colleagues bruno iochum , thomas krajewski , serge lazzarini , thomas schcker and daniel testard for collaboration and numerous discussions .",
