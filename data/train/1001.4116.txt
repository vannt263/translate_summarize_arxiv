    "the advent of cold atom physics has lead to increased importance being given to the precise determination atomic polarizabilities and related quantities .",
    "one very important source of systematic error in the new generation of atomic frequency standards is the blackbody radiation ( bbr ) shift  @xcite .",
    "the differential stark shifts caused by the ambient electromagnetic field leads to a temperature dependent shift in the transition frequency of the two states involved in the clock transition .",
    "the dynamic polarizability is also useful in the determination of the magic wavelength in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "another area where polarization phenomena is important is in the determination of global potential surfaces for diatomic molecules  @xcite .",
    "when consideration is given to all the atoms and ions commonly used in cold atom physics , the li atom and be@xmath0 ion have the advantage that they have only three electrons .",
    "this makes them accessible to calculations using correlated basis sets with the consequence that many properties of these systems can be computed to a high degree of precision .",
    "the results of these first principle calculations can serve as atomic based standards for quantities that are not amenable to precision measurement .",
    "for example , cold - atom interferometry has been used to measure the ground state polarizabilities of the li and na atoms @xcite .",
    "however the polarizability ratio , @xmath9 can be measured to a higher degree of precision than the individual polarizabilities  @xcite .",
    "so measurements of this ratio , in conjunction with a high precision _ ab - initio _ calculation could lead to a new level of accuracy in polarizability measurements for the atomic species most commonly used in cold - atom physics .    calculations and measurements of stark shifts are particularly important in atomic clock research since the bbr shift is predominantly determined by the stark shift of the two levels involved in the clock transition .",
    "the best experimental measurements of the stark shift have been carried out for the alkali atoms and accuracies better than 0.1@xmath10 have been reported  @xcite .",
    "experimental work at this level of accuracy relies on a very precise determination of the electric field strength in the interaction region  @xcite .",
    "high precision hylleraas calculations of the type presented here provide an invaluable test of the experimental reliability since they provide an independent means for the calibration of electric fields  @xcite .    the dynamic stark shift in oscillating electromagnetic fields is also of interest . the so - called magic wavelength , i.e. the precise wavelength at which the stark shifts for upper and lower levels of the clock transition are the same , is an important parameter for optical lattices .",
    "the present calculation is used to estimate the magic wavelength for the li @xmath1",
    "@xmath11 @xmath2 transition .",
    "the present calculations of the ac stark shift potentially provides an atomic based standard of electromagnetic ( em ) field intensity for finite frequency radiation .",
    "there have been many calculations of the static polarizabilities of the ground and excited states of the li atom and the be@xmath0 ion @xcite .",
    "the most precise calculations on li and be@xmath0 are the hylleraas calculations by tang and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the hylleraas calculations were non - relativistic and also included finite mass effects for li .",
    "large scale calculations using fully correlated hylleraas basis sets can attain a degree of precision not possible for calculations based on orbital basis sets @xcite .",
    "there have been many calculations of the dynamic polarizability for li @xcite , but fewer for be@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the present calculation is by far the most precise calculation of the dynamic polarizability that is based upon a solution of the non - relativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "one particularly noteworthy treatment is the relativistic single - double all - order many body perturbation theory calculation ( mbpt - sd ) by safronova _",
    "this calculation is fully relativistic and treats correlation effects to a high level of accuracy , although it does not achieve the same level of precision as the present hylleraas calculation .",
    "the present work computes the dynamic dipole polarizabilities of the li atom and the be@xmath0 ion in the @xmath1 , and @xmath2 levels using a large variational calculation with a hylleraas basis set .",
    "this methodology allows for the determination of the computational uncertainty related to the convergence of the basis set .",
    "analytic representations of the dynamic polarizabilities are made so they can subsequently be computed at any frequency .",
    "finally , the difference between the calculated and experimental binding energies is used to estimate the size of the relativistic correction to the polarizability .",
    "the final polarizabilities should be regarded as the recommended polarizabilities for comparison with experiment .",
    "all quantities given in this work are reported in atomic units except where indicated otherwise .",
    ".comparisons of the binding energies ( in a.u . ) of li and be@xmath0 in their low - lying states .",
    "the experimental valence binding energies are taken from the national institute of standards database  @xcite . the @xmath12-weighted average is used for states with @xmath13 .",
    "the ground - state energies for the @xmath14li@xmath0 and @xmath14be@xmath15 ions are @xmath16 and @xmath17 a.u . respectively",
    "the ground - state energies for @xmath4li@xmath0 and @xmath5be@xmath15 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 a.u . respectively",
    "underlining is used to indicate digits that have not converged with respect to basis set enlargement . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      recently le  roy _ et al _ @xcite analysed the ro - vibrational spectrum of the lithium dimer obtaining an estimate for the @xmath20 parameter describing the long range @xmath21 potential of the a - state that dissociates to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states .",
    "the @xmath20 parameter can be related to the @xmath22 multiplet strength .",
    "the determination of le  roy _ et al _ represented an order of magnitude improvement in precision over any previous determination of @xmath20 .",
    "the current value of @xmath23 a.u . computed with relativistic corrections is about 0.0155@xmath10 smaller than the experimental value of le  roy _ et al_. the finite mass calculation with the relativistic correction is closer to experiment than the infinite mass @xmath20 , but there is a remaining discrepancy of 0.0017 a.u .. it is not likely that qed effects can explain the discrepancy as pachucki _",
    "et al _ found that these were 2.5 times smaller than relativistic effects in the polarizability of helium @xcite .",
    "it must be recalled that the le  roy _ et al _ experiment is reporting an order of magnitude improvement in experimental precision . going to such extreme levels of precision means there might be small corrections that need to be applied to the analysis of the data that have not received consideration .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath20 will be different for states asymptotic to the @xmath24 and @xmath25 levels .",
    "the analysis of le  roy _ et al _ uses a common @xmath20 value for both members of the spin - orbit doublet .",
    "irrespective of this , it should be noted that experiment and theory are incompatible at precisions better than 0.01@xmath10 .",
    "the difference between the present and le  roy @xmath20 is used to assign an error to the present polarizability calculation .",
    "changes of 0.008@xmath10 were made to the @xmath26 matrix elements , the polarizabilities were recomputed , and the differences assigned as the uncertainty in the recommended values .",
    "this difference is actually larger than the estimated relativistic change in the matrix element .",
    "therefore , the recommended static polarizability of the li ground state is 164.11(3 ) a.u .. uncertainties in the @xmath27 matrix elements are smaller ( relativistic effects have a smaller impact on these matrix elements ) and have not been included in the uncertainty analysis . the final value for the static scalar polarizability of the @xmath2 state was 126.970(4 ) a.u .",
    ", while the tensor polarizability was 1.612(4 ) a.u ..    the same uncertainty analysis was applied to the be@xmath0 ion polarizabilities .",
    "the recommended value for the ground state is 24.489(4 ) a.u .. the static @xmath2 scalar polarizability was set as 2.0285(10 ) a.u . while the tensor polarizability was set to 5.8528(10 ) a.u ..    uncertainties in the recommended dynamic polarizabilities in tables [ tab:2 ] , [ tab:3 ] , [ tab:4 ] and [ tab:5 ] were computed by making corrections to the matrix elements , recomputing and then observing the change .",
    "these uncertainties are best interpreted as indicative as opposed to rigorous estimates .",
    "definitive non - relativistic values for the dynamic dipole polarizabilities of li and be@xmath0 in their low - lying @xmath1 and @xmath2 states have been established using the variational method with hylleraas basis sets .",
    "calculation for both finite and infinite nuclear mass systems have been performed .",
    "analytic representations for the dynamic polarizabilities of the li atom and the be@xmath0 ion have also been developed .",
    "these results can serve as a standard against which any other calculation can be judged .",
    "subsidiary calculations have been used to estimate the impact of relativistic effects that are not explicitly included in the hylleraas calculation . it is recommended that the value of 164.11(3 ) a.u .",
    "be adopted as the static polarizability of @xmath4li .",
    "the uncertainty of 0.03 a.u . is based on the difference between the present @xmath20 and that of le roy _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "this accuracy level is also supported by the @xmath4li @xmath28 stark shift of @xmath2937.14 a.u . which is in perfect agreement with the value of @xmath2937.14(2 ) given by the high precision experiment of hunter _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the recommended static polarizability for be@xmath0 is 24.489(4 ) a.u ..    the dynamic polarizabilities that have been obtained can be used as an atom based standard for electromagnetic field intensity .",
    "these polarizabilities can be regarded as an initial attempt to develop atom based standards for polarizability and stark shift measurements .",
    "the primary virtue of the method with which the relativistic corrections were evaluated was simplicity of computation .",
    "for present purposes , the estimate of the relativistic corrections only has to be accurate to 10 - 20@xmath10 for the recommended polarizabilities to be valid .",
    "the comparisons that have been done with fully relativistic calculations suggest that the estimates of the relativistic corrections are indeed accurate at this level .",
    "however , a more rigorous estimate using the briet - pauli hamiltonian and perturbation theory would be desirable @xcite .",
