    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is a dwarf , irregular galaxy at a distance of approximately 61 kpc .",
    "it has a metallicity less than one - fifth solar @xcite and is considered an ideal laboratory for studying star formation from primordial gas .",
    "although the mass of the smc is approximately 1/250th the mass of the milky way @xcite , its current star formation rate of 0.05 solar masses per year @xcite is approximately 1/100th that of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the reason for the enhanced rate of star formation in the smc at the current epoch ( in comparison to the lmc and galaxy ) is unknown , but likely to be related to interaction of the magellanic system with our galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one of the key tracers of young star formation regions in our own galaxy are interstellar masers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within these regions , masers of water ,",
    "methanol and hydroxyl are common and strong ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , making them excellent tools for understanding properties of the associated star formation .",
    "some maser species accurately trace the systemic velocities of the regions that they are associated with ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , increasing their application to studies of galactic structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while others are thought to trace the evolution of high - mass star forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to date only two sources with masers ( of any species )",
    "have been observed in the smc and these were discovered more than 30 years ago in a search for water maser emission towards 15 regions with the itapetinga radio telescope @xcite .",
    "other extensive searches for masers have failed to detect any emission from the 6.7-ghz transition of methanol ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or oh maser emission ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "a full account of previous observations for both interstellar and circumstellar masers in the magellanic clouds has been reported in @xcite .",
    "observations of masers within the smc not only allow young high - mass star formation regions to be pinpointed , but can also enable the populations as a whole to be studied , and compared with the populations in other nearby galaxies ( including our own ) , allowing the effects of environmental conditions on maser populations to be studied .",
    "@xcite used their complete methanol maser survey of the lmc and smc to conclude that the methanol masers in the lmc were under abundant by a factor of 4 - 5 ( once the varying star formation rates were accounted for ) , likely because of the lower metallictiy in the lmc . whereas @xcite compared the number of detected water masers in the local group , finding that detection rates are consistent with those of our galaxy , with the exception of ic 10 which exhibited an overabundance .",
    "unlike the 6.7-ghz methanol maser samples used in @xcite , the water maser samples used in @xcite lack completeness , leaving a lot of uncertainties in both the number of sources expected and the numbers detected . in a modestly sized searches of star formation regions in the lmc , @xcite discovered six new water masers , while @xcite found a further eight , highlighting the incompleteness of the samples used in previous analyses .",
    "arguably the greatest impact that the currently incomplete sample of masers in the local group can provide is through measurements of accurate distances and dynamics of its members through very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations .",
    "such measurements are ongoing in our own galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , incorporating an increasingly large number of methanol masers spread throughout the galactic plane .",
    "the increasing number of masers detected in other galaxies of the local group mean that it is now feasible to begin incorporating proper motion studies of additional members into such programs .",
    "water masers are not favoured for such vlbi programs in our galaxy due to their often extreme temporal variability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their tendency to trace more complex internal source dynamics ( such as outflows ) .",
    "however , when measurements are made using both water and methanol masers they can be consistent to within a few per cent ( e.g. w3(oh ) : * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their relatively higher detection rates , flux densities and often simple spectra make them desirable targets in other members of the local group . through proper motion measurements ,",
    "masers provide the best opportunity to understand the present state and therefore the history and future of the local group .    here",
    "we present a series of observations of water masers within the smc .",
    "the primary motivation of these observations was to identify and characterise water masers in the smc that can be targets for future astrometric vlbi programs to measure proper motions of the smc in the short term , and possibly to measure trigonometric parallax once astronometric accuracies have increased to make such measurements feasible .",
    "the water masers we detected have been accurately positioned with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , and monitored to assess the feasibility of a long term vlbi program .",
    "between 2003 and 2011 we conducted a number of water maser observations in the smc ; both searching for new water maser sites and monitoring the emission from detected sources .",
    "the water maser observations used unallocated host - country time on the tidbinbilla 70 m radio telescope and director s time on the atca . in general only short allocations of time were available so the observing strategy and number of sources observed was adapted for each observation .",
    "we supplemented our water maser observations with an additional epoch of atca data ( project code c973 ) from the australia telescope online archive ( atoa ) .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] lists the epochs each source was observed , the telescope used , the spectral resolution , rms noise of the observations and the characteristics of detected emission . targeted observations for oh and methanol masers were also made towards each of the detected water masers using the parkes 64 m radio telescope and the atca ( these are described in section  [ sect : other ] ) .",

    "these observations failed to detect any emission from any of the observed transitions .",
    "the individual sensitivities of the observations are listed in table  [ tab : other_obs ] , and correspond to 5-@xmath3 detection limits in the range 0.06 to 0.75  jy .",

    "the four sources have maximum peak flux densities in the relatively narrow range 1.8 - 3.4  jy , and velocity ranges between 6.6 and 17.4  @xmath0 ( three of the sources lie between 6.6 and 7.8  @xmath0 ) . comparing these basic statistics with the sample of 379 galactic water masers reported by @xcite shows that the water masers in the smc are not comparable to highest luminosity galactic sources , and show much narrower velocity ranges . of the 379 galactic sources , 36 have flux densities between 180 and 1600  jy , which if we assume are located at a distance of 6 kpc , would be detected with flux densities between 1.8 and 16  jy if placed at the distance of the smc .",

    "however , it is likely that surveys such as that of @xcite much better represent the water masers with the higher flux densities ( as considered here ) than the weaker water maser sources which are more often solitary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "water masers associated with star formation regions in our own galaxy are often accompanied by masers of other species , such as oh and methanol @xcite .",

    "@xcite note that their stronger water masers are more often associated with either or both oh and methanol masers , seemingly in contrast to the smc sources . to determine if this difference is significant , we have considered the large maser samples of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "of these 36 water masers , 17 are associated with methanol masers with peak flux densities @xmath1210  jy ( 14 of the 17 are @xmath1220  jy ) which would be equivalent to a @xmath120.1  jy source at the distance of the smc and therefore detectable in our observations .",
    "similarly , 10 of the 36 water masers are associated with oh masers with peak flux densities greater than 25  jy that would correspond to 0.25  jy in the smc , which is @xmath25 times our 1-@xmath3 detection limit as listed in table  [ tab : other_obs ] .",
    "only one of the strong galactic water masers is associated with a 6035-mhz excited oh maser that it would be strong enough to be detected if at the distance of the smc .",
    "given that 47 per cent of equivalent galactic water masers have associated methanol masers strong enough to be detected by our observations at the distance of the smc , it may be that the characteristics of the four smc sources are inconsistent with those in our galaxy .",
    "however , it is not surprising that we fail to detect any oh emission from the two sources targeted for 1665- and 1667-mhz transitions given only 28 per cent of similar galactic water masers are associated with 1665- or 1667-mhz oh masers that would be detected if placed at 60 kpc .",
    "similarly , we would not expect to detect 6035-mhz oh masers towards the smc water masers if their properties are similar to galactic sources .",
    "@xcite found that methanol masers in the lmc were under abundant by a factor of 4 - 5 once the different star formation rates had been accounted for .",
    "this under abundance was attributed to lower metallicity in the lmc compared to out galaxy , in agreement with the earlier study of @xcite .",
    "the smc similarly has a lower metallicity than our galaxy ( @xmath2one - fifth solar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so it is expected to also show a significant under abundance of methanol masers which may explain why neither our sensitive targeted observations , or the complete search of @xcite , uncovered any emission from this transition .",
    "observations targeting the two water maser positions reported by @xcite were made on three separate occasions ; twice with the atca ( 03123 and 08213 ) and once with tidbinbilla ( 08173 ) , and failed to detect any emission towards either source to 5-@xmath3 detection limits in the range 75 to 175  mjy over the minimum observed velocity range of 10 to 220 @xmath0 . when detected more than 30 years ago , s7 peaked at 7.4  jy at a velocity of 120.8 @xmath0 and s9 exhibited two spectral features , the strongest of which was 4.2  jy at a velocity of 120.9 @xmath0 .",
    "our observations show no emission at these , or nearby velocities .",
    "since the hpbw of the earlier observations was 4.5 arcmin , it is possible that the sources fell outside our much smaller beams .",
    "however , given the sensitivity of our observations , it is likely that we would have detected them anyway if they remained at flux densities similar to those reported by @xcite , especially given the poor spectral resolution of their observations ( 1.35  @xmath0 ) which could have significantly underestimated the flux density of these sources .",
    "[ fig:3col ] shows the locations of s7 and s9 overlaid on a three colour infrared image .",
    "it can be seen that s9 ( black cross ) is projected against a bright region of infrared emission , while s7 ( green cross ) is on the periphery of the bright emission .",
    "looking at the spectra presented in @xcite , it is s7 that has the higher signal - to - noise , lending credence to its authenticity even though it is located in a seemingly unlikely location with respect to the infrared emission . in order to rule out any persistent emission , sensitive mosaic observations centred on the reported positions need to be conducted .",
    "given that the observations were conducted more than 30 years ago , it is also possible that the emission has genuinely dropped below detectable limits .",
    "@xcite conducted monitoring observations of 43 water masers , associated with young stellar objects ( ysos ) , over a 20 year period .",
    "their observations show that it is not unusual for water masers to vary on relatively short timescales , and in fact show that a number of their sources fall below their detection limit on several occasions , generally returning or replaced by emission at a similar velocity sometime later . however , this characteristic is not sufficiently common to explain the appearance and disappearance of the only two previously detected water masers in an approximately synchronised fashion .",
    "the more likely scenario seems to be that the reported positions are sufficiently poor that we missed one or both of them with our much smaller beams , or perhaps less likely given the convincing spectra and their locations with respect to infrared emission , one or both were never authentic detections .",
    "water maser emission in our galaxy is known for exhibiting much higher levels of temporal variability over relatively short time - scales than other commonly observed maser species ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our water maser observations span a number of years , with varying sampling rates , allowing us to assess the overall level of variability in the water masers we detect , and determine whether this is consistent with galactic sources . in the following paragraphs",
    "we discuss the variability of each of the detected masers and then compare their variability with similar galactic sources .    _",
    "ngc346  ir1 _ was observed once in 2003 , 11 times in 2008 and once in 2011 .",
    "no emission was detected during the 2003 observations to a 5-@xmath3 detection limit of 0.29  jy .",
    "then , in 2008 we detected two relatively strong features , the strongest of which ( @xmath23  jy ) was observed over just three days , disappearing during the eight days between our 08203 and 08211 epochs .",
    "this feature was not detected in any further observations , so its lifetime appears to be less than five years .",
    "the spectral feature at @xmath2168 @xmath0 has basically remained stable ( aside from the changes in velocity discussed in section  [ sect : acc ] ) over the course of the observations in 2008 ( 11 epochs over 32 days ) .",
    "observations in 2011 revealed a weaker feature at a similar velocity which is inconsistent with the velocity that would be expected if the feature continued to accelerate at the rate seen in 2008 .",
    "it is therefore possible that this component has been replaced by similar emission .    on day 08203",
    "we observed this source with both the atca and tidbinbilla .",
    "the measured peak flux densities of the stronger feature at @xmath2173  @xmath0 were 3.4 and 2.7  jy at the atca and tidbinbilla , respectively .",
    "these values are marginally inconsistent with our 10 per cent calibrations errors .",
    "it can be seen that the secondary feature in both observations is approximately stable at @xmath20.6  jy .",
    "while it is possible that there is some real variability seen in this source ( although the time range of the observations are similar , the atca spectrum is the average value over several hours , whereas the tidbnbilla spectrum is a small snapshot of this time ) , it is likely that the measured flux density difference can largely be accounted for by the different noise contributions and spectral resolutions in the respective observations .    _",
    "n66  sc12 _ has the most complicated spectral structure of the detected sources , exhibiting many features over the broadest velocity range ( 17.4 @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is also the weakest source during many of the epochs making a quantitative study of its variability difficult . in 2003",
    "it showed essentially a single , strong ( 1.6  jy ) spectral feature that was not detected in any of our 2008 or 2011 observations .",
    "instead , during the later epochs the emission was replaced by a plethora of weaker features , showing few components that can be tracked over significant time ranges .",
    "although the signal - to - noise of many of the observations conducted in 2008 is low , it appears that some of the features associated with this source show variability on time scales of days .    _",
    "iras004307326 _ shows the most consistent and stable emission of all the smc water masers .",
    "given the relatively poorer spectral resolution during the single 2003 and 2011 observations , it is difficult to comment on the stability of the individual components of the clearly complicated and blended structure over the full time period , but the strongest features are clearly persistent .    _",
    "iras011267332 _ shows moderate levels of variability .",
    "the component at @xmath2177.5  @xmath0 first detected in 2003 persists all the way through to our final observation in 2011 ( although reduces in flux density by more than half ) , and exhibits an accompanying feature from 08228 at @xmath2181.5 @xmath0 .",
    "the final spectrum shows a broadening in the original feature at a velocity of @xmath2177.5  @xmath0 , perhaps indicating the presence of a new feature that is spectrally blended with the persistent one .",
    "a number of the detected sources show levels of variability that would be rated amongst the most variable star formation masers in our galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the disappearance of the 3  jy feature of ngc346  ir1 on a time scale of a week is equivalent to a @xmath2300  jy source reducing to less than @xmath212  jy .",
    "@xcite highlighted one of their 379 galactic star formation water maser sources as showing extreme variability ; fading from 80  jy to @xmath40.2  jy in a period of less than a year , a reduction that is probably less extreme than the feature associated with ngc346",
    "ir1 ( given the relative timescales ) .",
    "the appearance of the feature in the 08228 observations of iras011267332 would be equivalent to a @xmath43  jy source increasing by a factor of @xmath210 over a period less than two weeks , similarly showing quite extreme variability .",
    "arguably the most variable source in the smc is n66  sc12 , showing evidence of significant change over a matter of days , rarely showing the same spectral structure from epoch to epoch .",
    "in addition , the probable variation of the two out of two previously detected water masers @xcite over 30 years would be an unlikely event in equivalent galactic sources of more than @xmath2400  jy .    due to the small sample size , it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the global variability properties within the smc , however , the characteristics of the detected sources show evidence of higher levels of variability ( on average ) on very short timescales than similar galactic sources , perhaps consistent with them being influenced by a generally more dynamic environment . future monitoring observations of the water masers in the lmc may also provide a useful comparison .",
    "the spectra of ngc346  ir1 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : smc_ir1 ] show an apparent velocity shift in the feature at @xmath2168  @xmath0 , tending to less positive velocities as time progresses .",
    "[ fig : ngc ] shows the peak flux density , line fwhm and peak velocity parameters from gaussian fits to the detected line during each of the observations carried out in 2008 .",
    "also overlaid on the peak velocity plot is the line of best fit , with parameters of intercept = 168.68 and slope = 0.027 ; corresponding to a drift in velocity of 9.6 @xmath0 yr@xmath1 over the 31 day period . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc ] there is no correlation between the change in peak velocity with either peak flux density or the fwhm of the detected emission , ruling out the possibility that the change in velocity is influenced by the variability of a spectrally blended feature .",
    "a number of studies have noticed similar behaviour in water maser components associated with galactic high - mass star formation regions .",
    "the fraction of water masers that show velocity drifts is probably grossly underestimated due to the compounding effects of complex spectra , variability and the small number of sources that have been monitored . in spite of this , @xcite reported 15 isolated maser components with accelerations in the range 0.02 to 1.8  @xmath0 yr@xmath1 ( with equal numbers of positive and negative acceleration ) over time spans of 60 to 4600 days .",
    "similarly , @xcite noted an outward acceleration in one of the water maser features associated with w75n of 1.45 @xmath0 yr@xmath1 , while @xcite found that two of the spectral feature associated with g353.273 + 0.641 underwent synchronised changes in velocity at a rate of @xmath25 @xmath0 yr@xmath1 , occurring during a maser flaring period .",
    "@xcite also noted acceleration in the blue - shifted emission of two sources associated with galactic star formation : g291.2700.719 and g291.2840.716 .",
    "the changes in velocity were noted over long periods ( more than 20 years ) and correspond to accelerations of 0.7 and 0.4 @xmath0 yr@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "@xcite concluded that the accelerating features were likely associated with outflow material that is still fairly close to its origin ( otherwise it would be expected to begin decelerating ) .",
    "@xcite offer additional possible explanations for observed velocity drifts , including the rotation of a disk , changes in the velocity of a collimated outflow or the precession of an outflow .",
    "given that the systemic velocity for this source is not known to high accuracy ( nearby co clouds show comparable velocities ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we are unable to determine its positive or negative acceleration , or how close this feature is to the systematic velocity , making physical interpretation difficult .",
    "our acceleration is larger than any of the reported values for galactic water masers ( although similar to some extragalactic water masers ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is also the smallest time range considered . in general , there seems to be a trend in the reported values of acceleration to be smaller when measured over longer time periods .",
    "our relatively high acceleration perhaps indicates that the emission is associated with outflow material that is very close to its origin .",
    "an alternative scenario might be that the sparseness of the observations and longer time period considered in some sources has masked bursts of acceleration that have subsequently been averaged out in the calculated accelerations , which may also be consistent with a precessing outflow .",
    "we conducted one further observation of ngc346  ir1 in 2011 ( not included in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc ] ) that is not consistent with that expected from the simple linear fit to the 2008 data .",
    "if we include these data and determine the average acceleration over the @xmath23 year period , it drops to @xmath20.5 @xmath0 yr@xmath1 , perhaps indicating that over a longer period the characteristics of this source are not unlike other galactic sources presented in the literature . however , our favoured explanation is that the feature observed in 2008 disappeared in the intervening period before our 2011 observations ( perhaps due to disruptions caused by an outflow ) and was replaced by generally similar emission at a slightly different velocity .",
    "this scenario is supported by the fact that the accompanying characteristics also exhibited more extreme values ( peak flux density = 0.22  jy ; fwhm = 1.27 @xmath0 ) than the range seen in the 2008 observations .",
    "the magellanic clouds are the focus of detailed studies for a number of reasons , one of which is that they are clearly interacting , both with each other and with the halo of the milky way .",
    "evidence for this is seen particularly in the hi distribution which shows tidal features - the magellanic stream , the leading arm and the magellanic bridge ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "interactions and mergers of galaxies are known to play a key role in their evolution throughout cosmic history , and the magellanic system provides an opportunity for the key factors and effects of interactions to be investigated at high spatial resolution and sensitivity .",
    "our understanding of the way in which the magellanic clouds are interacting with the milky way has changed dramatically in the last decade due to new measurements of their proper motions @xcite , which suggest that they are not gravitationally bound to the milky way ( as has previously been thought ) , and are undergoing their first ( and last ) interaction with it @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the proper motions of the lmc and smc based on _ hst _ studies of a number of fields in both galaxies remain controversial .",
    "dynamical simulations which attempt to model the distribution of stars and gas in the magellanic system using these proper motions have been unable to reproduce observed structures such as the bifurcation of the stream and leading arm @xcite .",
    "one of the complications in the existing optical proper motion studies is that they estimate the proper motion by averaging over all the stars in a particular field .",
    "however , the smc has a significant line - of - sight depth which means that any field contains contributions from more than one dynamical population - both the halo and disk of the galaxy .",
    "the uncertainty due to this is not included in the formal error estimates of the lmc and smc proper motions determined from the _ hst _ data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the water masers we have discovered in the smc are both strong ( peak flux density greater than @xmath21  jy ) , and compact ( angular scales less than 1  milliarcsecond ) , which means that they are ideal targets for vlbi .",
    "vlbi observations have achieved astrometric accuracies better than 10  @xmath11as for a single epoch with instruments such as the vlba ( very long baseline array ) and vera ( vlbi exploration of radio astronomy ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , the most accurate measurements of proper motions of northern local group galaxies m33 and ic10 have been from measurements of water masers in these systems @xcite . the proper motion of the smc estimated from _",
    "data is @xmath13 mas / year ; @xmath14 mas / year @xcite .",
    "so it should be possible to measure the proper motion of the smc to an accuracy better than 10 percent using vlbi observations with a temporal baseline of 12 years .",
    "the primary difficulty in making proper motion observations of water masers is that they exhibit significant temporal variability ( see section  [ sect : var ] ) , making it difficult to track individual maser component `` spots '' over the course of an extended vlbi program .",
    "the water masers in the smc are all associated with young , high - mass star formation regions , which means that they are found in regions of dense gas .",
    "this gas shows much lower velocity dispersion than the general stellar populations , and as the masers are spectral line sources , the combination of a proper motion observation with the line - of - sight velocity gives the full three dimensional velocity vector of the object .",
    "however , although water masers offer some benefits for proper motion studies compared to those based on stellar populations , they have their own shortcomings and sources of uncertainty .",
    "the observed proper motions of interstellar masers in the smc will contain three contributions : 1 . a component due to the proper motion of the centre of mass ( com ) of the smc ; 2 . a component due to the orbital motion of the star formation region about the com of the smc ; 3 . a component due to internal motions of the masing gas within the star formation region .",
    "the first of these is the critical measurement , but the uncertainty in any determination of this depends upon both the precision in the proper motion measurement and the accuracy with which the other two components can be estimated .",
    "water masers in star formation regions typically arise in shocks or outflows , and velocities in excess of 100  @xmath0 are not uncommon in galactic water masers @xcite . at an assumed distance of 61",
    "kpc , a velocity uncertainty of @xmath210  @xmath0 corresponds to a proper motion uncertainty of @xmath20.04  milliarcseconds per year ( or a few percent ) .",
    "in addition to this , with only four water masers known in the smc and variability potentially making it challenging to obtain proper motion measurements from some of these , uncertainties due to random errors will dominate ( unlike the _ hst _ measurements where it is systematic effects which are more important ) .    in summary , astrometric vlbi observations of the water masers in the smc offer a potential alternative means of measuring its proper motion .",
    "such measurements could be achieved , if made with careful calibration of the residual path lengths , with the current capabilities of the australian long baseline array for water maser sources with peak flux densities less than 2.5  jy when there is a relatively strong ( @xmath12100 mjy ) calibrator within 1 - 2 degrees of the targets .",
    "these measurements are free from some of the systematic errors which potentially affect the optically - based proper motion determinations .",
    "although they have their own sources of uncertainty , they do provide an independent means of determining the proper motion of the smc .",
    "@xcite investigated the properties of the infrared ysos associated with the lmc water masers and compared the properties of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with those of the general population of ysos in the lmc identified by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the maser - associated ysos were more luminous and have redder infrared colours than the population as a whole and that the seds inferred the maser sources have higher mass , luminosity and ambient density than the majority of ysos in the lmc .",
    "we have used the results from the _ spitzer _ sage - smc project @xcite to investigate the ysos associated with smc water masers for which we have measured the position with the atca .",
    "the sage - smc observations have angular resolution of around a few arcseconds for the observations at wavelengths less than 10  @xmath11 m and a few tens of arcseconds for wavelengths greater than 20  @xmath11 m .",
    "the positions of the infrared sources are accurate to better than 1 arcsecond , so investigation of the properties of the s7 and s9 maser candidates can not be undertaken , since the position for these sources is uncertain at the arcminute level .",
    "all four of the smc water masers detected in the current observations have a sage - smc source with 0.5 arcseconds of the maser position .",
    "@xcite identified 34 candidate yso in the smc which are bright at both 24- and 70-@xmath11 m and undertook mid - infrared spectroscopy of these sources .",
    "iras004307326 is the strongest source at 70  @xmath11 m in the @xcite sample ( source # 03 in their list ) and from their spectra they identify polycyclic - aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission , silicate absorption and both water and co@xmath15 ice absorption .",
    "the presence of ice absorption indicates that the sources are surrounded by a cool envelope , and hence highly embedded and young sources . of the other three smc water masers",
    "iras011267332 has a bright 70-@xmath11 m source offset from the maser position by a little over 2 arcseconds , but the remaining sources do not have a nearby 70-@xmath11 m point source ( and hence were not included in the @xcite sample ) .    using the online sed fitting tool of @xcite",
    ", we have investigated the seds of the maser - associated ysos in the smc .",
    "we have used the same general approach as applied to lmc ysos by @xcite , the only differences being that for the smc we allowed the fitted distance to vary between 59 and 62  kpc , and for sources where there is strong evidence for pah emission contaminating the mid - infrared photometry we used the method of @xcite , to mitigate its effects on the sed fitting .",
    "the yso models of @xcite ( which are used in the sed fitting ) , do not include the affects of pah emission , which can significantly affect the measured intensity in the 3.6- , 5.8- and 8.0-@xmath11 m _ spitzer _ bands .",
    "the only _ spitzer _ irac band which is not affected by pah emission ( when it is present ) is the 4.5-@xmath11 m band , and @xcite identified sources with a characteristic dip in this band using the criteria [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] @xmath4 0.5 and [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] @xmath12 1.5 , as those with significant pah emission . figure  9 of @xcite shows that this characteristic dip at 4.5-@xmath11 m is commonly seen in maser - associated yso in the lmc and we find that all of the maser - associated yso in the smc show a dip at 4.5-@xmath11 m in the sed plots ( see figure  [ fig : sed ] ) . the only source for which the pah emission is significant ( using the criteria of @xcite ) is iras004307326 . for this source we used the approach outlined in @xcite for sources with a 24-@xmath11 m measurement ( this involves setting the measured 5.8- and 8.0-@xmath11 m intensities as upper limits and increasing the estimated uncertainty at 3.6-@xmath11 m to 20 percent ) .",
    "for all other sources we used the 2mass and sage - smc intensities and estimated uncertainties in our sed fitting .    the results of the sed fitting can be seen in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "they show that the infrared observations for all sources are consistent with the masers being associated with deeply embedded , highly luminous ysos .",
    "@xcite found significant differences between the maser - associated yso and the rest of the yso population in the mass of the central source , the total luminosity and the ambient density ( see figure 10 of @xcite ) . comparing the results obtained for the smc maser - associated yso with those in the lmc we find that they fall in the same range , with the mass of the central source greater than 15  m@xmath16 , the total luminosity greater than 15 000  l@xmath16  and the ambient density greater than @xmath17 @xmath18 in all four sources .",
    "this strong similarity is to be expected , and suggests that future water maser searches targeting sage - smc sources with characteristics similar to those of the known maser - associated sources are likely to find additional masers in the smc .",
    "from a number of targeted water maser observations conducted with both the tidbinbilla 70-m radio telescope and the atca we present the discovery of four water masers in the smc . in a series of sensitive observations ,",
    "we fail to detect any water maser emission towards the positions reported in @xcite .",
    "our monitoring observations of each of the detected water masers , combined with the non - detection of the previously detected sources , show evidence for the smc water masers to be more variable , in general , than similar galactic sources also associated with ysos .",
    "these observations also revealed that one of our water masers ( ngc346  ir1 ) exhibited an accelerating feature at a rate of 9.6  @xmath0 yr@xmath1 .",
    "we conducted targeted observations for methanol and oh masers at the positions of the newly detected water masers with both the atca and the parkes 64-m radio telescope and found no emission from any of the observed transitions .",
    "the absence of methanol maser detections in our targeted observations , combined with the results of the complete survey of @xcite , is consistent with the smc showing an under abundance of methanol masers compared to our galaxy , likely due to lower metallicity ( as was found for the lmc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the seds of the ysos associated with our detected water masers have been investigated and reveal that the sources associated with water masers in the smc are comparable to those in the lmc @xcite .",
    "it is expected that targeted water maser observations towards sources with similar characteristics will be a successful criterion for finding more water masers in both magellanic clouds .",
    "the detected water masers will make excellent targets for future vlbi observations to provide and independent , accurate measurement of the proper motions of the smc .",
