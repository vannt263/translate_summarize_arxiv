    "pulsars are fascinating astronomical objects in the universe . after more than 40 years since the discovery of the first pulsars , their pulsed non - thermal emission has not been completely understood due to the insufficient knowledge about the global acceleration electric field and particle dynamics in the magnetosphere .",
    "high energy emission ( e.g. @xmath0-ray emission ) from pulsars takes away a significant fraction of the rotational energy .",
    "several space telescopes were used to observe high energy emission from pulsars .",
    "six @xmath0-ray pulsars and three candidates were discovered by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) ( thompson et al .",
    "one young pulsar ( psr b1509 - 58 ) was detected only up to 10 mev by the imaging compton telescope ( comptel ) ( thompson 2001 ) .",
    "pulsars detected by egret show double peaks with bridge emission .",
    "thanks to the launching of astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ( agile ) and fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( fgst ) , more than forty new @xmath0-ray pulsars have been discovered in the last year , including gamma - ray only pulsars and a new population of millisecond pulsars ( pellizzoni et al .",
    "2009 , abdo et al .",
    "2009b , abdo et al .",
    "2009c ) . with these data",
    ", we have good opportunities to study the open questions , e.g. , the location of the emission zones , possible particle dynamics in the magnetosphere and so on .",
    "theory on non - thermal high energy emission from pulsars should be significantly improved in the coming years .",
    "physical and geometric magnetosphere models have been proposed to explain pulsar s @xmath0-ray radiation , as we will summarize below , differing on the acceleration region of the primary particles and the mechanism for the production of the high energy photons .",
    "the first is the polar cap model ( daugherty & harding 1982 , daugherty & harding 1994 , daugherty & harding 1996 ) .",
    "the acceleration region is located in the vicinity of neutron star surface up to tens of kilometers near the magnetic pole .",
    "the observed phase - resolved spectra of @xmath0-ray pulsars can also be modeled .",
    "this model favors a small inclination angle , e.g. , a nearly aligned rotator .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission region is so close to the neutron star surface that high energy @xmath0-ray photons could be absorbed in the strong magnetic field ( lee et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the polar cap model was combined with the slot gap model recently to explain the pulsar @xmath0-ray radiation ( muslimov & harding 2003 , muslimov & harding 2004 ) .",
    "a 3d model of optical - to-@xmath0-ray emission from the slot gap was developed to study the crab pulsar s light curve , phase - averaged and phase - resolved spectrum ( harding et al . 2008 ) .",
    "hirotani ( 2008 ) demonstrated that the slot gap model reproduces at most 20% of the observed fluxes because of the small trans - field thickness .",
    "the two - pole caustic model is proposed by dyks & rudak ( 2003 ) .",
    "the gap is thin , confined to the surface of the last open field lines , and extends from both polar caps to the light cylinder .",
    "double peak light curve with a large peak separation ( e.g. , vela ) can be well reproduced by this model . but this model has difficulties in explaining the light curves with small peak separations ( e.g. , b1706 - 44 and b1055 - 52 ) .",
    "frackowiak & rudak ( 2005 ) presented spectral and light curve properties of gamma radiation obtained by numerical modeling of some pulsars , i.e. psr j0218 + 4232 , psr j0437 - 4715 and psr b1821 - 24 .",
    "the outer gap model is another excellent model to interpret @xmath0-ray emission from pulsars ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , cheng , ho & ruderman 1986b , chiang & romani 1992 , romani & yadigaroglu 1995 , romani 1996 , zhang & cheng 1997 , cheng , ruderman & zhang 2000 , zhang et al .",
    "2004 , lin & zhang 2009 ) .",
    "the classical outer gap starts at the null charge surface ( inner boundary ) , ends at the light cylinder ( outer boundary ) ; it is further bounded by the last open field line ( lower boundary ) and a layer of electric current ( upper boundary )",
    ". however , hirotani et al . ( 2003 ) argued that the position of the inner boundary could be shifted towards the neutron star surface because a current at nearly the goldreich - julian rate ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) is injected to the outer gap .",
    "tang et al . (",
    "2008 ) used this modified outer gap to study the multifrequency phase - resolved spectra of the crab pulsar .",
    "watters et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have simulated a population of young pulsars and computed the beaming pattern and light curves for the three models : the polar cap model , the two - pole caustic ( slot gap ) model and the outer gap model .",
    "venter et al . ( 2009 ) presented light curves of millisecond pulsars from 3d emission modeling , in the geometric context of the polar cap , the outer gap , and the two - pole caustic models .",
    "they found that most of the light curves are best fit by the two - pole caustic and the outer gap models , which indicates the presence of narrow accelerating gaps limited by robust pair production  even in these pulsars with very low spin - down luminosities .",
    "force - free relativistic mhd were used to study the time - dependent evolution and dynamics of pulsar magnetospheres for either aligned or oblique magnetic geometries ( contopoulos et al . 1999 , komissarov 2006 , spitkovsky 2006 , mckinnqey 2006 , timokhin 2006 and gruzinov 2007 ) .",
    "recent efforts on theoretical understanding the high energy emission from pulsars can be found from bai & spitkovsky ( 2009a ; 2009b ) .",
    "they modeled gamma - ray pulsar light curves for the two - pole caustic model ( slot gap model ) , the outer gap model and the  separatrix layer \" model using the more realistic magnetic field taken from 3d force - free magnetospheric simulations .",
    "their separatrix layer model might be associated with the current sheet beyong the light cylinder .",
    "their simulated results indicate that the separatrix layer model can best reproduce the observations .",
    "the annular gap model we are developing is originally proposed by qiao et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and qiao et al .",
    "the gap region is located between the critical field lines and last open field lines , and extends from the neutron star surface to the light cylinder .",
    "the region for high energy emission in the annular gap model is concentrated in the vicinity of the null charge surface , i.e. , an intermediate emission height , different from the outer gap model .",
    "the annular gap has a sufficient thickness of trans - field lines and a wide altitude range for particle acceleration .",
    "the role of the annular gap depends on the mono - polar voltage in the annular region , so it is favorable for short period pulsars .",
    "this model combines the advantages of the polar gap , the slot gap and the outer gap models , and works well for pulsars with short spin periods .",
    "it is a promising model to explain high energy emission from young and millisecond pulsars . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the @xmath0-ray light curves for young and millisecond pulsars in the framework of the annular gap model . in  2 , detailed physics and geometry of the annular gap",
    "are introduced .",
    "the results of simulated photon sky - maps and light curves for young and millisecond pulsars are presented in  3 .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in  4 .",
    "the open field line region of a pulsar magnetosphere can be divided into two parts by the critical field lines .",
    "one is the annular region , which is between critical field lines and last open field lines .",
    "the other is the core region , which is within the critical field lines .",
    "taking an anti - parallel rotator as an example , the radii of the core polar region ( @xmath1 ) and the full polar cap region ( @xmath2 ) are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) , here @xmath5 is the pulsar s radius , @xmath6 is the angular spin frequency .",
    "the radius of the annular polar region is @xmath7 . if pulsar s spin period is smaller , the annular radius ( @xmath8 ) is larger",
    ". therefore , the annular acceleration region is more important for those pulsars with a short spin period ( e.g. , millisecond and young pulsars ) and is negligible for older pulsars with a large spin period .",
    "if pulsars are bare quark stars ( xu 2002 , 2005 ) , then two kinds of acceleration regions could be formed , namely , the inner vacuum core gap and inner vacuum annular gap .",
    "if pulsars are neutron stars with enough surface binding energy , the inner vacuum core gap ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) can be formed for an inclined rotator with a magnetic inclination angle @xmath9 ; while the inner vacuum annular gap ( qiao et al .",
    "2004 ) can be formed only for an inclined rotator with a magnetic inclination angle @xmath10 .",
    "if the binding energy of a neutron star s surface is not high enough , both negative and positive charges will flow out freely from the surface . then",
    "two kinds of acceleration regions ( annular and core ) could be formed .",
    "particle acceleration is more effective in the annular gap region .",
    "the annular acceleration region extends from the pulsar surface to the null charge surface or even beyond it .",
    "this leads to a fan - beam @xmath0-ray emission , which is suitable to interpret the observed light curves and the broad - band emission ( qiao et al .",

    "the magnetic frame @xmath11 is generated by rotating the @xmath12 coordinates around @xmath13 axis by an inclination angle of @xmath14 , the @xmath15 axis is aligned with the dipolar magnetic moment * @xmath16*. point `` s '' is an emitting source on an arbitrary magnetic field line .",
    "the @xmath17 is the altitude of the radiation source from the neutron star center .",

    "we assume that pulsars have a dipole magnetic field in the magnetic nonrotating frame .",
    "thus dipole field line function can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the polar radius from pulsar center to an emission point ; @xmath29 is the maximum radius of the field line , which is the function of @xmath14 and @xmath30 . to obtain the field line constant @xmath29 for the last open field line , zhang et al .",

    "dyks & harding ( 2004 ) found that , at low altitudes , a distorted angle of the order of @xmath49 is attributed to the rotation deflection on the local direction of the magnetic field , where @xmath28 is the radial distance of the emission source .",
    "in the annular gap model , the radiation region is concentrated on the vicinity of the null charge surface of the last open field lines , the emission height is well below the light cylinder radius @xmath40 , and the sweepback effect on open field lines could be ignored .",

    "we take the width @xmath71 for young pulsars , and @xmath72 for millisecond pulsars . to calculate the light curves for a pulsar , we divide the polar shape of the annular gap into 31 rings and obtain the open field line with @xmath30 and @xmath73 .",
    "then we calculate the emissivities projected onto the sky @xmath74 and direction @xmath75 of the emission spot ( @xmath76 ) on each open field line of each ring in the magnetic frame .",

    "the @xmath0-ray emission with higher photon energy comes from higher altitudes in the magnetosphere .",
    "\\(2 ) the @xmath0-ray beams for both young and millisecond pulsars are hollow cones in shape .",
    "\\(3 ) the @xmath0-ray emission light curves ( pulse profiles ) are determined by the inclination angle of magnetic dipole field and the observer s viewing geometry .",
    "the magnetic inclination angles and viewing angles of millisecond pulsars can not well constrained by any methods at present .",
    "this leads to difficulties for precise reproduction of light curves .",
    "\\(4 ) the radiation regions of young pulsars are larger . in terms of an individual field line",
    ", this large region covers from the pulsar surface to about the half of the light cylinder radius .",
    "the peak emission comes near the null charge surface .",
    "\\(5 ) the radiation regions of millisecond pulsars are small , from the pulsar surface to about the one third of the light cylinder radius .",
    "the peak emission comes from a region below the null charge surface .",
    "\\(6 ) our model favors small inclination angles ( @xmath91 ) for the millisecond pulsars , and larger inclination angles ( @xmath92 ) for the young pulsars .",
    "this is somewhat compatible with the alignment of the spin and magnetic axes over about 1 myr from the analysis of the new pulsewidth data ( young et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "\\(7 ) our results also show that the solid angle of gamma - ray beams are much less than @xmath93 , especially for msps .",
    "this will reduce the @xmath0-ray emission conversion efficiency @xmath94 , and solve the puzzle for @xmath95 in abdo et al .",
    "( 2010b ) .    as shown in qiao et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2007 ) , the annular gap can have sufficient electric potential drop to produce pairs that can generate radio emission .",
    "radio emission can be generated even at a higher region either for the annular gap or core gap .",
    "if radio emission comes from a lower region of either inner annular gap or the core gap ( qiao et al .",
    "2004 ) , the radio peak should appear between the two @xmath0-ray peaks .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible that the radio radiation comes from a higher region or the opposite magnetic pole , producing a leading or trailing radio peak .",
