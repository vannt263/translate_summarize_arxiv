    "the concept of an eccentric , `` precessing '' disk was a crucial ingredient of the tidal - thermal instability model of superoutbursts proposed by osaki ( 1996 , 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "results of recent analysis of superoutbursts of z cha ( smak 2007 , 2008a ) definitely show , however , that superoutbursts are due to a major enhancement in the mass transfer rate .",
    "it is worth to recall that an alternative model for superoutbursts , involving such enhanced mass transfer resulting from variable irradiation of the secondary component , was considered earlier by osaki himself ( osaki 1985 ; see also mineshige 1988 ) .",
    "further work in this direction appears now highly desirable .",
    "eccentric , `` precessing '' disk continues to be an essential ingredient of the commonly accepted model for superhumps ( see also osaki 1996 , 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "observational evidence for eccentric , `` precessing '' disks in dwarf novae during their superoutbursts was presented during the last three decades by numerous authors . under those circumstances",
    "the question posed in the title of the present paper can be considered rather provocative .",
    "even more provocative , however , will be our negative answer to that question .",
    "the organization of the present paper will be as follows . in section 2",
    "we will clarify problems of terminology .",
    "the main part of the paper will then be devoted to a detailed critical review of the observational evidence for eccentric , `` precessing '' disks resulting from the analysis of radial velocities ( section 3 ) , of the observed ( disk ? ) eclipses ( section 4 ) , and of the spot of eclipses ( section 5 ) .",
    "results will be discussed in section 6 .",
    "three periodicities are observed during superoutbursts : the orbital period @xmath2 , the superhump period @xmath3 , and the corresponding beat period @xmath4    @xmath5    accordingly , three sets of phases are to be considered : the orbital phase @xmath6 ( or simply @xmath7 ) , the superhump phase @xmath8 , and the beat phase    @xmath9    it is commonly assumed that the beat period @xmath4 represents the apsidal motion of an eccentric disk ( or an outer eccentric ring ) , usually referred to ",
    "incorrectly  as `` precession '' .",
    "consequently , the beat period is called the `` precession '' period while the beat phase  the `` precession '' phase .",
    "the orientation of an eccentric disk / ring can be defined by the position angle @xmath10 of the periastron with respect to the line of sight .",
    "this position angle is directly related to the beat phase @xmath11 .",
    "in general , they could differ by a constant phase shift . in practice , however , using various kinds of observational evidence , nearly all authors ( e.g. vogt 1981 , hessman et al .",
    "1992 ) assume or conclude that the beat phase @xmath12 corresponds to the situation when the periastron is facing the observer , i.e. that    @xmath13",
    "using textbook formulae for the two body problem we find that the radial velocity of a point on an elliptical ring is given by    @xmath14~,\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is describing the orbital motion , @xmath16 is the position angle of the point considered with respect to the periastron , @xmath10  the position angle of the periastron with respect to the line of sight ( both counted counterclockwise ) , and    @xmath17^{1/2}~,\\ ] ]    is an equivalent of the standard expression for the rotational velocity of the disk / ring . here",
    "@xmath18 is the major semi - axis of the ring and @xmath19  its eccentricity .    for the radial velocity of an element of the ring seen in projection on the white dwarf and the central parts of the disk ( to be discussed in sections 3.2 and 3.3 ) we obtain    @xmath20    for the maximum and minimum radial velocity , corresponding to the red and blue peaks of the emission line ( to be used in section 3.4 ) we get    @xmath21      the first evidence for an eccentric disk in a dwarf nova during the superoutburst came from spectroscopic observations of z cha made by vogt ( 1981 ) during its 1978 march / april superoutburst .",
    "vogt measured radial velocities from the central absorption components of the double emission lines and found ( see his fig.7 ) that those measured on 1978 march 28/29 were very high ( his @xmath22 km / s ) while those measured on 1978 march 27/28 ( i.e. on the previous night )  very low ( @xmath23 km / s ) .    to intepret those results vogt proposed the following model ( see fig.9 of his paper ) : the central absorption components are produced in the outer eccentric ring , specifically  in the region which is seen in projection on the central parts of the disk . the difference between @xmath24 and @xmath25 results from the apsidal motion of the ring : the value of the beat period @xmath26d implies that the orientation of the eccentric disk on two consecutive nights differs by about 180@xmath27 .",
    "this interpretation , however , can be easily shown to be incorrect .",
    "to do so we calculate the beat phases corresponding to the times of vogt s spectroscopic observations . for the night of march 27/28 we obtain @xmath28 , while for the night of march 28/29 we get @xmath29 . from eq.6",
    "it immediately follows that radial velocities measured on march 27/28 should be systematically _ positive _ , while those on march 28/29  systematically _",
    "negative_. this , however , is just opposite to the observed effect . in other words ,",
    "the orientations of the ring during those two nights were  roughly  opposite to the two orientations shown in vogt s fig.9 .    to complete our discussion let us return to the problem of the origin of central absorption components .",
    "vogt assumed  arbitrarily  that they are formed in the outer eccentric ring . in reality , however , the double emission lines , including their central absorption components , are produced in the atmosphere of the entire disk .",
    "furthermore , in the particular case of z cha , an additional , variable contribution due to the absorption in the overflowing parts of the stream ( smak 2007 ) is likely to be present .",
    "such a possibility is suggested by the fact that , according to vogt , the absorption components are strongest near the orbital phase @xmath30 , i.e. when the overflowing stream is directly projected against the central parts of the disk .      to strengthen his interpretation of z cha vogt presented additional evidence based on absorption - line @xmath31-velocities of wz sge measured by several authors during its 1978 superoutburst .",
    "his fig.8 did indeed show sinusoidal variations of the @xmath31-velocities with the beat phase .",
    "however , to calculate @xmath11 vogt adopted an incorrect value of the beat period : @xmath32d . the corrected version of his @xmath33 diagram , with @xmath11 calculated with @xmath34d ( patterson et al . 1981 ) , shows only large scatter with _ no _ obvious dependence of @xmath31-velocities on @xmath11 .",
    "the eccentricity of the disk can be determined , using eq.7 , from vogt s radial velocities measured from the peaks of the double emission lines .",
    "for this purpose we use radial velocities e@xmath35 and e@xmath36 listed in his table 6 ( excluding only four uncertain values of e@xmath35 with @xmath6 between 0.10 and 0.40 which were near - blends with the absoprtion component ) .",
    "first , we correct them for the orbital motion    @xmath37    using two , rather different sets of parameters determined from observations at quiescence , namely : ( 1 ) @xmath38 km / s , @xmath39 , @xmath40 km / s ( vogt 1981 ) , and ( 2 ) @xmath41 km / s , @xmath42 , @xmath43 km / s ( marsch et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "results , obtained with those two sets of parameters , are : ( 1 ) @xmath44 km / s , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and ( 2 ) @xmath47 km / s , @xmath48 , @xmath49 . as can be seen the eccentricity , if any , is close to zero .",
    "worth noting is that in both cases the resulting disk radius turns out , as expected , to be close to the mean radius of the roche lobe @xmath50 .",
    "the evidence discussed below for oy car ( section 4.2 ) and iy uma ( section 4.3 ) was based on the dependence of various eclipse parameters on the beat phase , interpreted in terms of the apsidal motion of an eccentric disk .",
    "such an interpretation , however , assumes implicitly that the observed eclipses are _ pure disk _ eclipses .",
    "this is obviously not true .",
    "we now have evidence , based on the detailed analysis of eclipses in z cha ( smak 2007 ) , showing that , depending on the beat phase , they represent a combination of eclipses of several different sources : ( 1 ) the disk , ( 2 ) the `` standard '' spot ( around @xmath0 ) , or ( 3 ) the `` peculiar '' spot , involving stream overflow ( around @xmath51 and 0.75 ) , and ( 4 ) the superhump source ( around @xmath52 ) .",
    "their relative contributions depend strongly on the beat phase .",
    "consequently , the resulting dependence of the observed eclipse parameters on @xmath11 is quite complicated . under those circumstances the only practical solution is to decompose the observed light curves into their separate components ( as it was done in the case of z cha ; smak 2007 ) .",
    "it can be hoped that the existing light curves of oy car and iy uma will eventually be analyzed in such a way . for the time being we can only mention that the shapes of the _ pure disk _ eclipse light curves obtained for",
    "z cha ( smak 2007 ) do not show any dependence on the beat phase .",
    "krzemiski and vogt ( 1985 ) collected light curves of oy car during its january 1980 superoutburst and determined several parameters describing the shape of the observed eclipses : ( 1 ) deviations of the eclipse amplitude @xmath53 from the amplitude @xmath54 vs. epoch @xmath55 relation , ( 2 ) deviations of the eclipse width @xmath56 from the width @xmath57 vs. epoch @xmath55 relation , ( 3 ) the eclipse asymmetry @xmath58 , measured at half - depth , and ( 4 ) the values of ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "they found that all those parameters show  roughly  sinusoidal variations with the beat phase ( see their figs.7 - 11 ) and interpreted them as being due to the apsidal motion of an eccentric disk . in what follows",
    "we will show that this interpretation was incorrect .",
    "first of all , as noted by krzemiski and vogt themselves , variations predicted by their eccentric disk model ( see their fig.12 ) for @xmath56 and @xmath58 do not agree with their observed variations .",
    "specifically , their model predicts _",
    "double sinusoidal _",
    "variations for @xmath56 , while in the case of @xmath58 the model predicted variations are shifted in @xmath11 by @xmath60 .    to interpret the observed variations of @xmath53 krzemiski and vogt assumed that the outer parts of the disk , on the other side of the white dwarf , remain uneclipsed . using system parameters of oy car ( wood et al .",
    "1989 ) we find , however , that this assumption would require the disk radius to be larger than @xmath61 , which is already larger than the upper limit to the disk radius @xmath62 , obtained from the condition that it must be smaller than the distance from l@xmath63 to the white dwarf .",
    "this implies that the far side of disk is fully eclipsed .",
    "the geometry of eclipses of the hypothetical eccentric disk in oy car is shown schematically in fig.1 .",
    "it can immediately be seen that , regardless of the surface brightness distribution , the eclipse amplitude should show _",
    "double sinusoidal _ variations with @xmath11 , which is inconsistent with observations .",
    "= 1.5 cm    the observed variations of @xmath53 with @xmath11 can , in fact , be qualitatively explained by the variable contribution from the hot spot . in particular , around @xmath0 , when the `` standard '' hot spot is present , its",
    "eclipses make the full eclipse amplitude larger .",
    "patterson et al . ( 2000 ) presented results of their extensive photometry of iy uma covering the declining part of its 2000 january superoutburst . from the analysis of the observed light curves they found that all eclipse parameters depend strongly on the beat phase .",
    "in particular , around @xmath0 the eclipse amplitude is largest and all characteristic phases are systematically more positive ( see their figs.7 and 9 ) .",
    "patterson et al . interpreted those effects as being to due the apsidal motion of a strongly eccentric ( @xmath64 ) disk .",
    "there are several arguments against such an interpretation .",
    "first of all , we can recall our general comments from section 4.1 .",
    "secondly , we may note that the observed dependence of eclipse parameters on @xmath11 ( similar to the case of oy car ; section 4.2 ) is most likely due to the variable contribution from the hot spot which  on account of the orbital inclination ( @xmath65 ) being much higher than in the case of oy car ( @xmath66 )  is expected to be relatively larger . around @xmath0 , when the `` standard '' hot spot is present , the contribution from its eclipses makes the observed eclipses deeper and shifted toward later phases . in partcular ,",
    "the large values of @xmath67 observed around @xmath0 ( fig.9 in patterson et al .",
    "2000 ) correspond probably to the egress of the `` standard '' hot spot .",
    "the presence of the hot spot in a dwarf nova during its superoutburst was detected for the first time by schoembs ( 1986 ) .",
    "his light curves of oy car obtained during the final decline from its 1980 november / december superoutburst showed clearly the characteristic eclipses of the hot spot .",
    "six years later hessman et al .",
    "( 1992 ) published results of their photometry of oy car , made also during the final decline from another of its superoutbursts , their light curves showing also characteristic spot eclipses .",
    "unfortunately , the significance of these discoveries was not fully appreciated at that time , the presence of those eclipses being interpreted in terms of the _ reappearance _ of the quiescent hot spot .",
    "the hot spot eclipses during superoutburst maximum were first detected by patterson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in wz sge during its 2001 superoutburst .",
    "regretfully , this interpretation was challenged by osaki and meyer ( 2003 ) who argued that those eclipses were not due to the hot spot but rather due to _ `` the superhump light source itself''_.    situation was definitely clarified only very recently by the results of our analysis of eclipse light curves of z cha and oy car ( smak 2007,2008b ) observed during maxima of their superoutbursts .",
    "they were decomposed into their disk and spot components , the resulting hot spot light curves showing not only the characteristic shape of the eclipse but also the characteristic maximum around the orbital phase @xmath68 .      according to the commonly accepted `` standard '' model",
    ", the hot spot is produced by the collision of the stream with the outer parts of the disk .",
    "in such a case , the distance @xmath69 of the spot from the white dwarf , to be referred to as `` spot distance '' , determined from spot eclipses , is identical with the radius of the disk @xmath70 .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that in the case of an eccentric disk this @xmath70 is the _ local _ radius of the disk at a specific position angle corresponding to the point of collision .",
    "furthermore , when such an eccentric disk rotates due to the apsidal motion , the dependence of @xmath70 on the position angle produces its periodic variations with the beat phase .    in the analysis of eclipses of the `` standard '' hot spot we use the phases of mid - ingress @xmath71 and mid - egress @xmath72 which are related to the mass ratio @xmath73 ( defining the shape of the stream trajectory ) , the orbital inclination , the spot distance @xmath69 , and its ellongation parameter @xmath74 ( cf .",
    "smak 1996,2007 ) .",
    "when the mass ratio and inclination are known , the two phases @xmath71 and @xmath72 can then be used to obtain two indpendent determinations of the spot distance :    @xmath75    it is obvious that in the case of a `` standard '' hot spot they must be identical    @xmath76    the observed luminosity of the hot spot depends on the `` impact parameter '' @xmath77 ( i.e. on the square of the relative velocity of collision between the stream and the disk ) .",
    "the value of this impact parameter increases with decreasing radial distance @xmath69 .",
    "therefore in the case of variable disk radius the luminosity @xmath78 of the `` standard '' spot should vary as    @xmath79    the last two relations provide two crucial tests for the applicability of the concept of a `` standard '' hot spot and  in particular  for assuming that the radial distance of the spot ( @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) is identical with the radius of the disk @xmath70 .",
    "= 9.0 cm    recent analysis of hot spot eclipses in z cha during its superoutbursts ( smak 2007 ) provides good illustration of different situations to be encountered in this area .",
    "the `` standard '' hot spot eclipses are observed only at beat phases @xmath82 . in particular , the spot distances @xmath80 and @xmath81 determined from those phases are practically identical . on the other hand ,",
    "the spot eclipses observed at intermediate beat phases ( around @xmath83 and around @xmath84 ) are rather peculiar .",
    "first of all , the resulting spot distances are generally smaller , with @xmath80 being systematically larger than @xmath81 .",
    "this could be seen already from fig.6 of smak ( 2007 ) and is shown here in the lower part of fig.2 .",
    "secondly , the luminosities of the spot observed at intermediate beat phases are systematically lower ( smak 2007 , fig.5 ) .",
    "those peculiarities were interpreted ( smak 2007 ) as being due to a substantial stream overflow .",
    "supporting this interpretation is a correlation between the duration of egress @xmath85 and the spot distance @xmath81 , mentioned already in section 5.3 of that paper , and shown here in the upper part of fig.2 .",
    "the lesson learned from z cha can be summarized in the form of the following warning : the spot distances @xmath86 , obtained from the analysis of peculiar spot eclipses , observed at intermediate beat phases , _ do not provide any reliable information about the radius of the disk_. this warning becomes even stronger when the observed spot luminosities imply @xmath87 .      as already mentioned above , schoembs ( 1986 ) and hessman et al .",
    "( 1992 ) presented extensive photometric coverage of the advanced stages of the 1980 november / december and 1987 february superoutbursts of oy car . during the final decline their light curves showed characteristic",
    "eclipses of the hot spot .",
    "hessman et al . (",
    "1992 ) analyzed those light curves in order to determine the location of the hot spot .",
    "specifically , using the phases of mid - ingress , they obtained spot distances @xmath80 and found that they show strong dependence on the beat phase @xmath11 , interpreted by them as being due to the `` precession '' of a strongly eccentric ( @xmath88 ) disk .",
    "this interpretation , however , can easily be challenged .    to begin with",
    ", we must note that the variations of the spot luminosity @xmath78 and the spot distance @xmath80 with @xmath11 , shown in their fig.8 are strikingly similar to the case of z cha ( cf .",
    "section 5.2 ; see also figs.5 and 6 in smak 2007 ) .",
    "this immediately suggests that  like in the case of z cha  the `` standard '' hot spot was present in oy car only around @xmath0 and that spot distances @xmath80 obtained from intermediate beat phases should not be treated as a reliable measure of the disk radius @xmath70 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    to clarify the situation definitely we analyze the available light curves of seven spot eclipses ( eclipses 7 - 1 , 7 - 3 , 9 - 1 , 9 - 2 , 10 - 1 , and 10 - 2 from fig.3b of schoembs 1986 , and the eclipse from fig.1-bottom of hessman et al .",
    "for each of them we determine the phases of mid - ingress @xmath71 and mid - egress @xmath72 and the duriation of egress @xmath85 .",
    "then , using geometrical system parameters ( wood et al . 1989 ) and adopting two different values of the spot ellongation parameter @xmath89 and 0.04 , we obtain the spot distances @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "results , presented in fig.3 , show that the situation is indeed nearly identical with that in the case of z cha ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "in addition , we have @xmath90 ( fig.8 in hessman et al . 1992 ) . taking all this into account",
    "we must conclude that at intermediate beat phases away from @xmath0 we are dealing with a `` peculiar '' rather than `` standard '' spot and that  consequently  the spot distances @xmath80 obtained at those phases do not provide any reliable information about the disk radius @xmath70 .",
    "patterson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) published results of a worldwide photometric campaign covering the 2001 superoutburst of wz sge .",
    "one of their most important results was the detection  for the first time  of hot spot eclipses during the main part of superoutburst maximum .",
    "they analyzed those eclipses in a standard way finding that all hot spot parameters varied significantly with the `` precession '' ( i.e. beat ) phase .",
    "this was interpreted by them as being due to the apsidal motion of a strongly eccentric ( @xmath91 ) disk .",
    "this interpretation , however , can easily be challenged .    in our analysis",
    "we use the values of @xmath92 and eclipse widths ( fig.21-left of patterson et al .",
    "2002 ) to recover the phases of mid - ingress ( @xmath71 ) and mid - egress ( @xmath72 ) . then , using system parameters from steeghs et al .",
    "( 2007 ) we determine the spot distances @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "situation is somewhat complicated here by the fact that the zero - point of the orbital phases , defined by mid - eclipse of the spot , does not correspond to the true zero - phase .",
    "the values of the corresponding phase shift , obtained by different authors from the analysis of spot eclipses ( e.g. smak 1993 ) or from radial velocity curves ( e.g. spruit and rutten 1998 , steeghs et al .",
    "2001 ) , range from @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "in our analysis we adopt : @xmath97 .",
    "for the spot ellongation parameter we also adopt two values : @xmath98 .",
    "= 3.5 cm    = 9.0 cm    fig.4 shows an example of the resulting spot distances @xmath93 and @xmath94 plotted _ versus _ the beat phase and fig.5 presents a comparison of those two parameters obtained using four combinations of @xmath74 and @xmath99 . as can be seen , the situation is very similar to the case of z cha ( fig.2 ) and oy car ( fig.3 ) . in particular ,",
    "the condition @xmath100 is fulfilled only by the largest values of those parameters , corresponding to @xmath0 , while at other beat phases we have @xmath101 .",
    "in addition , the spot visibility and its luminosity depend strongly on @xmath11 ( fig.21-top in patterson et al .",
    "2002 ) , this behavior being strikingly similar to the case of z cha . taking all this into account we conclude that away from @xmath0 we are dealing with a `` peculiar '' spot and that  consequently  the values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 obtained from those phases are not representative for the radius of the disk @xmath70 .",
    "results presented above in sections 3 - 5 can be summarized in the form of the following conclusions :      * the spectroscopic evidence for eccentric disks in z cha and wz sge , presented by vogt ( 1981 ) , based on radial velocities measured from absorption components , is shown to be an artifact , resulting from miscalculated beat phases . * the photometric evidence for eccentric disks in oy car ( krzemiski and vogt 1985 ) and iy uma ( patterson et al . 2000 ) , based on the observed dependence of various eclipse parameters on the beat phase , involved an implicit assumption that the observed eclipses are _ pure disk _ eclipses .",
