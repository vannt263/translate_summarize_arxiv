    "the lorenz dynamical system , originally introduced by lorenz @xcite in order to describe in a very simplified way the rayleigh - bnard problem @xcite , immediately became important in itself as one of the most studied low - dimensional chaotic systems . still today the lorenz model represents a paradigmatic example for both theoretical and numerical investigations in checking some results in chaos theory  @xcite , in the study of geometrical properties of dynamical systems  @xcite , in nonlinear analysis of time series @xcite , in the stabilization and synchronization of coupled systems @xcite , and so on .",
    "+ nevertheless , despite the great attention attracted over past decades , some fundamental and rigorous results have been obtained quite recently , as for instance the proof of the existence of the lorenz attractor @xcite , usually using somewhat sophisticated mathematical tools .    on the contrary ,",
    "our aim here is to provide a description of lorenz system dynamical features , which requires quite simple analytical tools and , at the same time , allows a very intuitive inspection in lorenz - like chaos .",
    "preliminary results have been reported in a short communication @xcite . here",
    "we shall give more details and new results .",
    "our interpretation will base itself upon the fact that in the `` steady state '' , i.e. , far from the initial transient and when the memory of the initial conditions has been lost , the lorenz system is equivalent to a suitably constructed second order integral - differential equation .",
    "this equation can be regarded , for instance , as a customary second order one - dimensional classical mechanics equation with a peculiar forcing term .",
    "the corresponding dynamics can be interpreted as the one - dimensional motion of a particle in a conservative quartic two - well potential , subjected to a viscous damping and to an additional force resulting from the past history of the motion .",
    "the latter force turns out to be essential for chaos to emerge as it acts as an `` endogenous '' forcing able to permanently sustain the motion even in presence of friction .",
    "the previous interpretation of lorenz dynamics actually leads to a generalization of the lorenz model to a wider class of systems showing similar dynamical properties .",
    "we shall introduce a particular system belonging to such class which , because of its simplicity ( piecewise linearity ) , will allow us to study the dynamics of the original model using analytical tools .",
    "indeed , in the steady chaotic regime ( i.e. when the system permanently lies on its attractor set ) the evolution of a point in the lorenz phase - space can be roughly described as a somewhat regular amplified oscillation around one of its fixed points , followed by a sudden entry in the control basin of a twin fixed point symmetrical with respect to the origin , by a new amplified oscillation around the latter point , by a sudden return in the control domain of the former , and so on .",
    "+ the most evident aspect of the chaotic regime is just the unpredictability of the instant at which the center of the aforementioned amplified oscillations changes . the choice of a piecewise linearized version of the original model will allow us to highlight this point , while keeping unchanged the peculiar topological properties of the lorenz dynamics .",
    "the exact equation ruling the instant of change of the oscillation center will be derived and a discontinuous dependence of this instant on the initial conditions will be highlighted .",
    "it will also be possible to write the analytical equations that defines the first - return two - dimensional poincar map for the piecewise linearized system , which in turn synthesizes the main chaotic features of the model dynamics .",
    "moreover , we shall show that , under suitable and reasonable conditions , the evolution of the system completely reduces to a one - dimensional chaotic map .",
    "+ to summarize , starting from our interpretation , we shall be able to propose a piecewise linearized version of the lorenz model , which on one hand has the same dynamical properties of the original system and , on the other hand , will provide analytical tools to explicate the emergence of chaos in lorenz - like systems .",
    "the original lorenz system  @xcite consists of the three first order ordinary differential equations @xmath0 where the dots indicate time derivatives and @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are positive parameters originally related to the fluid properties and to the boundary conditions in the rayleigh - bnard problem .",
    "( lorenz  @xcite used @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "+ the fixed points of system ( [ lorenz ] ) and their corresponding stabilities depend on @xmath3 . for @xmath7",
    "there is only one ( stable ) fixed point in @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath9 the origin looses its stability and a pair of new fixed points appear : @xmath10^{1/2}$ } , \\mbox{$\\pm [ b(r-1)]^{1/2}$ } , \\mbox{$r-1)$}$ ] , which are stable in the range @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "( note that the critical value @xmath13 exists if and only if @xmath14 ) . for @xmath15",
    "all fixed points are unstable , and the lorenz system can exhibit either periodic or chaotic behavior ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive exposition on the matter ) .",
    "since we are interested in the case @xmath9 , we can suitably define the scaled coordinates @xmath16^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath17^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath18 , so that the system becomes @xmath19 with fixed points @xmath8 and @xmath20 .",
    "we now reduce the lorenz system to a unique differential equation for @xmath21 , whose solution makes it possible the direct calculation of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . by inserting into the third equation of the expression for @xmath24 in terms of @xmath25 obtained from the first , one easily gets @xmath26,\\ ] ] whose general solution is given by @xmath27 we have already stated that we are interested in the evolution of the lorenz system in the chaotic steady state , i.e. far from the initial transient .",

    "+ to summarize , we insert in the second equation of @xmath22 obtained from the first equation and @xmath23 given by ( [ steady ] ) and get for the variable @xmath21 alone in chaotic steady state the following second order differential equation with memory ( in fact , an integral - differential equation ) @xmath38_b x\\right)\\;.\\ ] ]    one can interpret the previous equation as the dynamical equation of a ( unit mass ) particle , viscously moving in a compound potential energy field consisting of a weighted average ( in the chaotic regime @xmath39 ) of a quartic potential energy field independent of time ( fig . [ quartico ] ) @xmath40 and of a quadratic potential energy field @xmath41_b \\dfrac{(x^2 -1)}{2},\\ ] ] whose curvature is given by a suitable memory function of the past motion .    without the memory term",
    "the particle would stop in one of the minima of the bistable potential @xmath42 due to the damping term @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath44 contribution yields , through an exponential average on the past evolution , an `` endogenous '' forcing term which can permanently sustain the motion .",
    "the particle oscillates with growing amplitude around the minimum of one of the potential well until its energy is sufficient to allow the crossing of the barrier in @xmath45 . as already said , the chaotic behavior of the system emerges just in the unpredictability of the instant at which the particle moves from one well to the other .",
    "trajectories relative to very slightly different initial conditions can produce strongly different sequences in the number of oscillations in each well . in the next section",
    "we shall explain this fact analytically .    in order to simplify and to make the analysis standard ,",
    "let us rescale the time @xmath46 in eq .   as @xmath47^{1/2 }",

    "this fact shows how much these  opposite \" contributions are in fact strictly related if the equation is to be viewed as representative of the original lorenz system .",
    "even if one now considers the lorenz equation as the main subject of the study , one must note that not all the ( positive ) values of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are consistent with their definition in terms of the original parameters @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , in order to observe chaotic behavior , the following inequality must hold @xmath53 ( further details on the relation between the two sets of parameters are given in appendix [ app : b ] ) .",
    "equation allows us to highlight the role of the memory forcing term in the lorenz system dynamics . for this purpose",
    "it is interesting to compare the lorenz equation with other examples of chaotic nonlinear ( nonautonomous ) systems as , for instance , the inverse duffing equation @xmath54 , which describes a sinusoidally forced quartic oscillator @xcite , or more appropriately the parametrically forced equation @xmath55 note that in the latter cases the motion is sustained by externally assigned forcing terms , while in the case of the lorenz equation the motion is self - sustained by the endogenous term @xmath56_\\beta\\ , x$ ] . in figs .",
    "[ xv - lorenz-1 ] and [ duffing ] we give a numerically obtained comparison between the phase portraits of the lorenz equation and of equation ( [ unnamed ] ) with parameters , and suitably chosen in order to get similar ranges of motion .",
    "note that the endogenous lorenz forcing term , mimed by @xmath57 , is in fact neither monochromatic nor with vanishing average value .",
    "the lorenz equation can be usefully recast in the form @xmath58_\\beta\\,\\right)\\ , \\phi'(x)\\:=\\,0\\ ] ] where the prime indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath25 and in our case @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "such an equation can be interpreted as the description of the motion of a unit mass particle subjected to a viscous force @xmath61 and interacting with a potential field @xmath62 through a `` dynamically varying charge '' @xmath63_\\beta$ ] .",
    "this charge both depends on the instantaneous particle position @xmath64 ( by means of the term @xmath65 ) and on the past evolution ( by means of the _ memory charge _",
    "@xmath66_\\beta$ ] ) .",
    "the coupling of @xmath67_\\beta$ ] with the fixed potential field @xmath62 acts as an endogenous forcing term which can sustain the motion even in the presence of friction , and the chaotic behavior can actually arise from the synergy between this term and the viscosity .",
    "+ put in the form , the lorenz equation is arranged to be generalized to a generic charge @xmath65 interacting with a generic potential field @xmath68 .",
    "correspondingly , it is possible to obtain a _ generalized lorenz system _ whose `` @xmath25  -  projection '' ( far from the initial transient ) yields eq .  .",
    "indeed , by inverting the calculation followed to derive eq .   from system",
    ", one easily gets the generalized lorenz dynamical system @xmath69 . \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] therefore , the specific lorenz model can be viewed as singled out from a quite general class of dynamical systems which can exhibit chaotic behavior , their common essential property being an exponentially vanishing memory effect together with a viscous damping .",

    "we shall now focus our attention on a particular choice for @xmath72 and @xmath62 , that will maintain all the qualitative properties of the lorenz system and , at the same time , will allow us to deal with chaos analytically .",
    "as already noticed , the chaotic behavior of the lorenz system essentially depends on the unpredictability of the instants when @xmath25 change its sign : as long as it keeps constant sign the system evolution is certainly nonlinear , and nevertheless not  chaotic \" at all .",
    "this fact suggests a slight modification of the original form of the lorenz system , in order to single out analytically the origin of chaos without to be faced with the difficulties arising from nonlinear features .",

    "thus , we are faced with a simplified model , obtained by replacing the constant - in - time quartic potential with a piecewise quadratic one resulting from the superposition of two parabolas with vertex in @xmath82 and truncated at @xmath45 ( fig .  [ parabole ] ) . the two - well character of @xmath42 is obviously maintained as well as the piecewise differentiability .",
    "the replacement of the original potential actually corresponds to a linearization of the system around both unstable fixed points @xmath83 , with the metching performed in @xmath45 .",
    "it appears that the chaotic behavior of the original model does not depend on the differentiability in @xmath45 .",
    "one can guess that also other classes of dynamical systems can be transformed in a piecewise linearized version by means of the same operations .",
    "it is easy to check that the fixed points of are @xmath84 and that the equation ruling their local stability is the same as for the original lorenz system with parameters @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath85 .",

    "+ when dealing with system , the main simplification is that it is separately linear for @xmath87 and @xmath88 and can thus be analytically solved in each region . indeed , by applying the operator @xmath89 to each side of eq .",
    "one obtains the equation @xmath90 which can be explicitly solved separately on each side of @xmath45 .",
    "the nonlinearity of the model is simply reduced to a change of sign of the forcing term @xmath91 when @xmath25 crosses the plane @xmath45 , henceforth denoted with @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , the crossing times are somewhat unpredictable , as they result from the discontinuous solutions of an ( incidentally transcendental ) equation .",
    "our piecewise linearized system will thus turn out to be an important tool to analytically investigate the emergence of chaos in lorenz - like systems .",
    "the main advantage of the piecewise linearization is that one has to deal only with the simplest nonlinearity , i.e. an isolated ( not eliminable ) discontinuity ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for other examples of piecewise linear chaotic dynamical systems ) .",
    "let us now consider in detail the second order integral - differential equation  , which describes the evolution in time of @xmath25 for the piecewise linearized system in the chaotic steady state .",

    "+ in summary , according to the previous scheme , the system evolution in time is completely described by the following steps :    1 .",
    "motion for @xmath88 ; 2 .",

    "we recall that , in spite of its appearance , the map   is in fact non - linear , since the matrix @xmath209 depends on @xmath199 , which is a transcendental discontinuous function of the @xmath210-th initial conditions .",
    "+ indeed , under suitable conditions , the two - dimensional map for the linearized system practically reduces to a one - dimensional map .",
    "it has been already shown that for @xmath211 the motion in the phase space has the form   @xmath212 where @xmath213 and @xmath214 satisfy the equation @xmath139 , which in turn implies @xmath140 . as a consequence",
    "the evolution in the phase space @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 consists both of a `` rapid '' decay towards @xmath134 along the stable manifold @xmath135 and of a `` slow '' amplified oscillation on @xmath138 .",
    "we thus expect the phase trajectories to be strongly attracted on the unstable manifold and , once on @xmath138 , to slowly spiral outwards .",
    "provided trajectories start close enough to @xmath138 , then they meet the @xmath92-plane very close to its intersection with @xmath138 itself , i.e. , along the straight line @xmath215 let us assume that the attraction towards the unstable manifold is very strong and thus it takes place almost instantaneously ( the goodness of this assumption is controlled by @xmath216 ) . under this hypothesis",
    "all trajectories approximately hit @xmath92 along the straight line @xmath217 .",
    "thus , from eq .  , it follows that , immediately after each collision , the system necessary lies very close to the straight line @xmath218 therefore , the following relation between velocity and acceleration is expected to approximately hold @xmath219 from eqs . and",
    "an analogous linear dependence between the velocity and the memory follows @xmath220 where @xmath221 denotes the of @xmath116 evaluated at the collision . as a consequence , in the limit",
    "we have considered , the attracting set for the map is @xmath222 and , therefore , it reduces to an one - dimensional map .    since in the chaotic steady - state",
    "the velocity and the acceleration that define the initial conditions for the trajectory after each impact are not independent , the time @xmath199 can be expressed as a function of @xmath200 alone : @xmath223 ( see fig .",

    "the behavior of this map is easily understood if we refer to the graph of @xmath143 as a functions of @xmath160 and @xmath161 ( see fig .",
    "[ piramide ] ) .",
    "indeed , in the chaotic regime @xmath224 is superimposed to the region of the plane @xmath225 contained by @xmath184 , where @xmath143 shows unstable behavior with respect to a change in the initial conditions ( fig .",
    "[ sovrapp ] ) . for those values of @xmath200 ,",
    "for which @xmath224 passes through the same `` pseudo - elliptic '' corona , @xmath199 slowly changes with varying crossing velocity . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath224 intersects the boundary between two different coronas , @xmath199 shows a discontinuity in its dependence on @xmath200 ( fig .",
    "[ t - v ] ) .",
    "+ the linear dependence between velocity and acceleration immediately after each collision implies that the poincar map becomes one - dimensional , e.g. a map between @xmath202 and @xmath200 .",
    "figure  [ v - v ] shows this fact for @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 . by simple inspection of the derivatives corresponding to the fixed points of the map one can easily check that they are all unstable , so that the map produces a chaotic behavior .",
    "note that the discontinuities simply correspond to the analogous ones in the function @xmath223 , evaluated along the straight line given by and drawn in fig.[sovrapp ] .    for the sake of completeness , we turn now to the description of the piecewise linearized system in the original phase space @xmath25 , @xmath93 , @xmath97",
    ". there the system has two fixed points @xmath229",
    ". for each one there exists a stable manifold @xmath230 during the evolution the trajectories are rapidly attracted on the unstable manifold relative to the half - plane where they belong ( fig .  [ spaziofasi ] ) .",
    "thus , immediately after the crossing of the @xmath92-plane the phase point lies on one of the straight lines @xmath231 as for the crossing of the @xmath92-plane , the system can therefore be described by a one - dimensional map . to get the maps @xmath232 and @xmath233 from the analogous ones in the rigid wall scheme",
    ", one has simply to consider that @xmath202 coincides with @xmath234 .",
    "the reader should note that all the maps we have drawn in the previous figures have been obtained by numerically solving the analytical equation  , which exactly defines @xmath199 , @xmath235 , and @xmath236 , and they have not been computed by numerical integration of the differential system ( as usual for non solvable dynamical systems like the lorenz original one ) .",
    "thus , the use of numerical tools has been required only because of the transcendental character of the concerned equation .",
    "we explicitly remark that in general the attraction towards @xmath138 is not infinite , but nevertheless more rapid than the amplified rotation on the unstable manifold ( remember that @xmath237 @xmath238 ) .",
    "therefore , we can expect that , if @xmath216 is finite , the attractor set is not exactly the straight line @xmath222 , but a narrow `` strip '' that contains @xmath222 .",
    "this strip intersects the region of the graph of @xmath199 where the residence time is strongly dependent on initial conditions and the mechanism for chaos to arise is absolutely the same .",
    "our numerical simulations for finite @xmath216 are in excellent agreement with these predictions and then we do not show their corresponding graphs here , since they are practically indistinguishable from the graphs we have already discussed .",
    "we conclude our analysis by showing some simulated numerical results .",
    "bfore doing that , some remarks are worth discussing .",
    "we previously considered @xmath239 as independent coordinates in the phase space because of their physical meaning : it is more intuitive to speak about acceleration rather than of memory of the system . unfortunately , if we want to `` assign initial conditions '' to the original lorenz system after the crossing of the plane @xmath92 , we can not consider the acceleration and the velocity since from eq .",
    "they are not independent variables in @xmath45 . indeed the relation @xmath240 always holds , while the memory is not known _ a priori_. as a consequence , we have to consider as independent initial conditions position , velocity , and memory .",
    "however , it is worth remarking that the comparison between the lorenz system and the piecewise linearized one is completely meaningful . this because for the latter model @xmath241 is easily known in terms of @xmath200 and @xmath201 from eq .  : for the linearized system the choice of @xmath201 or of @xmath241 is absolutely equivalent .    since we are interested in the behavior of the lorenz system in the chaotic steady state , all the following results are thus obtained via the numerical integration of the steady - state differential system @xmath242 where now @xmath243_\\beta$ ] . this dynamical system , as already proved , is equivalent to the system   far from the initial transient",
    "we can now turn to the comparison with the piecewise linearized system . for the original lorenz model we have computed the maps that relate @xmath199 and @xmath234 to @xmath244 , respectively , by numerical integration of the system ( the notations are the same as in the previous section ) .",
    "figures  [ t - vl ] and [ v - vl ] show the results we obtained : the qualitative behavior of these maps is very similar to that of the analogous maps for the piecewise linearized system .",
    "as we will see , the mechanism for chaos to arise is indeed the same .",
    "+ observe that the maps in figs .",
    "[ t - vl ] and [ v - vl ] are not perfectly onto : obviously this is due to the fact that , in general , the lorenz system does not reduce exactly to an one - dimensional map when the plane @xmath45 is crossed .    from direct computation",
    "it appears that the residence time around a fixed point depends on the initial conditions in a way similar to that of the linearized system ( fig .",
    "[ torrel ] ) .",
    "there is a region in which @xmath143 varies continuously with varying initial conditions and a region ( figs .",
    "[ torrel ] and [ torrel1 ] ) of strong instability . in the latter region",
    "@xmath143 changes continuously along each `` annulus '' of the `` spiral , '' whereas it shows abrupt discontinuities crossing the boundary of each annulus . as expected , the system is attracted on that region ( fig .",
    "[ meml ] ) and the maps in figs .",
    "[ t - vl ] and [ v - vl ] derive from the overplotting between figs .",
    "[ meml ] and [ torrel1 ] .",
    "+ the chaos actually emerges due to the combination of the step - like first - exit - time ( fig .",
    "[ t - vl ] ) and of the piecewise return map ( fig .",
    "[ v - vl ] ) for initial conditions .",
    "this mechanism is the same as for the linearized model , for which we gave an analytical description .",
    "the results we obtained for the piecewise linearized system therefore provide in our opinion a useful enlightening tool to understand both the original lorenz system and its eventual generalizations .",
    "finally , in order to point out the connection between the original lorenz system and its piecewise linearized version , it is illuminating to compare the tent - like map shown by lorenz in his original work  @xcite with the analogous map for our simplified system . describing the relation between two consecutive maxima of the coordinate @xmath23 , lorenz found a univocal tent - like map ( fig .",
    "[ tenda ] ) . for our linearized system",
    "we obtain similar results ( see fig .",
    "[ tenda - lin ] ) .",
    "the growing branch of the map is approximately linear , since for small values of @xmath245 the system evolution is confined in a half - space and , there , it essentially consists of an exponentially amplified oscillation . for large values of @xmath245",
    "the map has the same shape of the lorenz tent - like map .",
    "the linear growing of the left branch of the map is due to the simplification we made on the evolution on each side of @xmath45 .",
    "the shape of the right branch shows that the piecewise linear system keeps all the complexity of the lorenz model , which can be attributed to the unpredictability of the @xmath45 crossing , which is the very origin of chaos in lorenz - like systems .",
    "the main conclusions from the present paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "we have reformulated in a classical mechanics form the dynamics of lorenz - like systems and showed that its three - dimensional phase - space dynamics can be mapped into an one - dimensional motion of a particle oscillating in a conservative quartic two - well potential , subjected to a viscous dissipation and to a memory forcing . starting from this interpretation , we have introduced a piecewise linearized version of the lorenz system ( belonging to a larger family of lorenz - like systems ) which substantially has the same properties of the original model with the advantage that it allows an analytical treatment .",
    "+ the most evident aspect of chaotic regime is the unpredictability of the instant at which the center of the particle amplified oscillation changes .",
    "chaos arises due to the combination of the step - like behavior of this time with the piecewise return map defining the crossing conditions .",
    "this aspect has been singled out analytically , focusing on the piecewise linearized version . there , the exact equation for the time , at which the oscillation center changes , has been derived and the discontinuous dependence of this time on the crossing conditions has been shown analytically . + by means of numerical simulations we have verified that the highlighted mechanisms for the chaos to emerge survive also for the fully - nonlinear lorenz system , where analytical techniques are not applicable .",

    "this work was partially supported by the infm project gepaigg01 .",
    "d. v. was partially supported by the doctoral grants of the university of nice and by grants of the university of genova .",
    "in the lorenz system , the following conditions for @xmath246 have to be satisfied in order to have three instable fixed points :    @xmath247    the parameters @xmath248 are defined as follows : @xmath249 from ( [ prima ] ) and ( [ seconda ] ) it immediately follows that @xmath248 are positive too .",
