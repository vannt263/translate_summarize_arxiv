    "considerable interest has been devoted recently to the breakup of free - surface flows into drops under the action of surface tension ( rallison 1984 ; stone 1994 ; eggers 1997 ) . here",
    "we investigate the complementary problem of surface - tension - driven coalescence of two drops , which is of fundamental importance in understanding the possible topological transitions in three - dimensional free - surface flows .",
    "for example , numerical implementations of merging ( lafaurie , nardone , scardovelli , zaleski & zanetti 1994 ) are based on phenomenological prescriptions for joining the two surfaces , without a fundamental understanding or description of the dynamics .    traditional applications of coalescence ideas include the description of two - phase dispersions . as an important example , we mention phase separation in two - phase flows ( nikolayev , beysens & guenoun 1996 ; bonnecaze , martula & lloyd 1998 ) , where the velocity field induced by the merging of two drops entrains other drops , thus enhancing the rate of coalescence . another classical problem connected with drop coalescence is sintering , i.e. the merging of a powder into a homogeneous material by heating . in many cases , in particular that of ceramics or glasses , bulk fluid motion is the dominant mechanism for coalescence and the dynamical process is known as viscous sintering . in a classical paper , frenkel ( 1945 ) posed the problem of the merging of two spheres by slow fluid motion as the first step towards understanding the properties of the material that results from sintering . for a different case",
    "in which surface diffusion is the dominant mechanism of mass transport , the asymptotics of coalescence has recently been worked out ( eggers 1998 ) , but such surface - dominated transport is very different from the bulk fluid motion of interest here .",
    "much of the experimental and numerical work on coalescence in viscous systems is motivated by the viscous sintering problem .",
    "an exception is an experimental paper ( bradley & stow 1978 ) on the coalescence of water drops , but the low viscosity of water makes the motion very rapid and difficult to observe . on the other hand , by using a very high viscosity fluid , the motion can be slowed down as much as desired ( brinker & scherer 1990 ) and the experimental results agree very well with numerical simulations of the stokes equations ( martinez - herrera & derby 1995 ) .",
    "the only theoretical analysis of three - dimensional coalescence is the qualitative work by frenkel ( 1945 ) .",
    "analytical solutions for two - dimensional coalescence ( i.e. of parallel cylinders ) have been obtained using complex variable techniques for the special case where the outer fluid is perfectly inviscid or absent ( hopper 1990 , 1992 , 1993a , b ; richardson 1992 ) .",
    "we show below that the three - dimensional problem has the same asymptotic behaviour as this two - dimensional solution at early times .",
    "our main aim , however , is to address the more general case of coalescence with a viscous outer fluid , for which we find that the structure of the solution near coalescence is quite different from the case of an inviscid exterior , though there is again a parallel between the two - dimensional and three - dimensional problems .",
    "part of the challenge in treating three - dimensional coalescence arises from the fact that it starts from a singular initial condition , shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we assume that the drops are initially spherical , which is based on an underlying assumption of negligible velocity of approach and hence negligible hydrodynamic deformation before contact .",
    "we imagine that two such drops have just been joined along their symmetry axis by some microscopic mechanism to form a tiny bridge of radius @xmath1 .",
    "evidently , the `` meniscus '' around the bridge will be a region of very high curvature , which drives the increase of @xmath1 with time .",
    "our main concerns will be the time dependence of @xmath1 for very early times , and the shape of the interface and the flow field near the meniscus .",
    "we note that the ratio of the coefficient of surface tension @xmath14 and the viscosity @xmath15 gives a fixed velocity scale @xmath16 , and thus the expected reynolds number @xmath17 will be be arbitrarily small as @xmath18 , and the flow will initially be described by the stokes equations regardless of the material parameters .    in the next section",
    ", we set up an integral representation of the stokes flow and split it into two parts : an outer region far from the meniscus , in which the shape is still close to the initial spherical condition , and an inner region near the meniscus in which the shape evolves rapidly .",
    "the dominant contribution to the velocity field comes from the high curvature of the meniscus , and its amplitude is determined by the lengthscale @xmath19 of this curvature .",
    "the main task is thus to find the structure and scale of this inner solution .",
    "since the inner solution is determined by the local curvature and not the global shape , the results obtained here are not restricted to the simple spherical geometry shown in figure [ fig1 ] . in section iii",
    "we show that only a negligible fraction of the fluid caught in the narrow gap between the two spheres is able to escape .",
    "the rest accumulates in a toroidal pocket , or bubble , of radius @xmath20 that forms at the meniscus .",
    "this bubble is connected to a thin neck of width @xmath21 .",
    "we have performed extensive simulations for the simplest case of equal viscosity fluids which confirm these scaling laws .",
    "in section iv we examine the inner `` bubble '' solution in greater detail .",
    "the bubble is joined to the neck by a short region of very large curvature on a lengthscale that appears numerically to be proportional to @xmath22 and thus tends to a corner as @xmath23 ( i.e. @xmath18 ) .",
    "though the curvature of this corner is much greater than that of the bubble , both contribute at the same order to the leading - order motion of the meniscus , which can be thought of as simply due to a ring force of strength @xmath24 smeared over a lengthscale @xmath25 . in the final section",
    "we discuss the case of arbitrary viscosity ratios and mention related problems , namely , the effect of arbitrary initial shapes and the scaling at zero outer viscosity .",
    "for simplicity we consider two initially spherical drops of equal radii @xmath0 , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "simple extensions to the cases of unequal radii and non - spherical shapes will be described in section v. we denote the viscosity of the drops by @xmath15 and that of the outer fluid by @xmath26 .",
    "as we have noted , the dynamics immediately after coalescence is described by the stokes equations .",
    "since these equations are linear , the velocity field can be expressed as an integral of the driving surface forces @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the normal directed into the outer fluid and @xmath29 is the curvature of the interface .",
    "we make the velocity dimensionless with respect to @xmath16 , all lengths with respect to @xmath0 , and times with respect to the corresponding timescale @xmath30 .",
    "calculation of the evolution of the interface @xmath31 requires only the interfacial velocity , which is given by the integral equation ( rallison & acrivos 1978 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 , \\qquad { \\bf k(r ) } = -\\frac{3}{4\\pi } \\frac{{\\bf rrr}}{r^5 } , \\qquad { \\bf r } = { \\bf x}_1 - { \\bf x}_2,\\ ] ] @xmath34 denotes a surface area element at position @xmath35 , and @xmath36 both lie on @xmath31 . the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ int ] )",
    "represents the driving by the surface forces , while the second accounts for the difference in viscosity between the fluids .",
    "the problem is closed by requiring that any material marker @xmath37 with position @xmath38 on the surface moves according to @xmath39    equation ( [ int ] ) and the identity @xmath40 ( which is a consequence of the incompressibility condition @xmath41 ) show that there would be no flow if @xmath42 were constant over @xmath43 .",
    "it follows that , in the early stages of coalescence when @xmath44 , the flow is driven by the small region around the meniscus where @xmath42 is not close to its initial constant value of 2 .",
    "this key observation motivates an analysis based on splitting the interface into two regions .",
    "we use cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath45 with origin at the junction between the drops . away from the region of coalescence , the surface is essentially undisturbed and thus has the form @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 in @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the width of the gap between the spheres is given by @xmath51 and , since @xmath52 , the interfaces on either side of the gap are nearly parallel .",
    "the solution for this outer region has to be matched with an inner solution on the scale @xmath53 of the bridge or meniscus where the two drops are joined .",
    "the inner solution has a region of very high curvature , which provides the dominant contribution to the velocity .",
    "to a first approximation , this region can be represented as a ring of radius @xmath1 and small width @xmath19 connected to two asymptotically straight interfaces each pulling outward with unit tension .",
    "the resultant effect is that of a radially directed ring force with strength 2 per unit length of the ring applied over a width @xmath19 .    to find the velocity field generated by this ring",
    ", we try integrating over a circular line @xmath54 of forces @xmath55 .",
    "considering , for the moment , only the simple case @xmath56 , for which @xmath57 can be computed directly from ( [ int ] ) , we have @xmath58 { \\rm d}\\sigma_2.\\ ] ] from this representation it is evident that the force distribution can not be represented by a line everywhere as the first term in the integral ( [ line ] ) would lead to a logarithmically infinite value of the velocity . in the neighborhood of @xmath59 ,",
    "when @xmath60 , one must account for the fact that the force is distributed over a length scale of size @xmath19 .",
    "the logarithmically dominant part of the integral , which comes from @xmath61 , gives a radially directed flow @xmath62    since the curvature of the ring is not apparent at leading order in the region @xmath63 that dominates ( [ log ] ) , we may equivalently consider the corresponding two - dimensional problem , in which coordinates @xmath64 take the place of @xmath65 . in that case",
    "( two parallel cylindrical drops connected along a narrow band of width @xmath66 ) the high - curvature meniscus is represented by two straight lines a distance @xmath66 apart . since the forces @xmath24 on the lines pull in opposite directions , they cancel on scales much greater than their distance apart , the integral ( [ line ] ) is cut off on the scale @xmath1 , and ( [ log ] ) again results .",
    "because of this asymptotic equivalence of the two - dimensional and axisymmetric problems , we will mostly consider the two - dimensional problem from now on , which is simpler numerically . the two - dimensional forms of the kernels @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be derived by integrating ( [ 3d ] ) along the third dimension to obtain @xmath69 , \\qquad{\\bf k(r ) } = -\\frac{1}{\\pi } \\frac{{\\bf rrr}}{r^4 } , \\qquad { \\bf r } = { \\bf x}_1 - { \\bf x}_2,\\ ] ] and the surface integral ( [ int ] ) is now along the perimeter of the two - dimensional drops .",
    "not only does ( [ log ] ) give the leading - order velocity in both two and three dimensions , but it also holds for all viscosity ratios @xmath70 .",
    "a summary of the argument is as follows .",
    "it is clear that the early flow can always be thought of as driven by ring or line forces of strength @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "since stokes flow has no inertia , this force is transmitted unaltered across any surface enclosing the bubble and , since the width of the gap between the spheres is asymptotically negligible , the force must be supported by the internal fluid , and the external fluid in the gap makes little difference . now the logarithmically large velocity of a slender body moving under a given force does not depend on the viscosity of the body , as can be seen explicitly in the solution for the motion of a cylinder of one fluid through another fluid ( lister & kerr 1989 ) . applying this result to the bubble at the meniscus",
    ", the finite viscosity of the external fluid in the bubble also makes little difference and ( [ log ] ) is correct at leading order for @xmath73 ( though the higher - order corrections do depend on @xmath70 ) .",
    "to evaluate the velocity from ( [ log ] ) , however , it is necessary to determine the scale @xmath19 over which the force is distributed at the meniscus and here the viscosity ratio does play a role . in the following section we will show that @xmath74 , where @xmath75 for finite @xmath70 and @xmath76 for the special case @xmath77 ( no outer fluid ) . by integrating ( [ log ] ) , we find that @xmath78 recalling that time is measured in units of @xmath79 , we see that the estimate based on dimensional analysis alone , @xmath80 is not quite correct , and in fact requires a logarithmic correction .",
    "using the equivalence of the two- and three - dimensional problems , we now study the coalescence of two viscous circular cylinders in more detail .",
    "figure [ fig1a ] compares hopper s exact solution for @xmath81 with a numerical simulation for @xmath56 in which the initial condition is that of a cusp with @xmath82 , smoothed on the scale of @xmath83 .",
    "( the numerical method is described in more detail below . )",
    "the shape of the meniscus for @xmath77 is the tip of a near cusp ( fig .",
    "[ fig1a]a ) , while the shape for @xmath56 is observed to be quite different for most of the evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig1a]b ) : the external fluid is collected in a small bubble at the meniscus , making the lengthscale @xmath19 of the local solution much larger than in the absence of an external fluid . only in the last stages of merging",
    "does the fluid caught inside the bubble escape and the results look qualitatively more like hopper s solution ( fig . [ fig1a]c ) .",
    "the existence of an exact two - dimensional solution for the special case @xmath77 of an inviscid or absent external fluid ( hopper 1993a , b ; richardson 1992 ) allows us to test the general ideas of section ii .",
    "asymptotic expansion of this solution near the meniscus shows that @xmath84^{1/2 } \\qquad\\qquad(x\\ll1),\\ ] ] from which we deduce that the highly curved region is of size @xmath85 , and the curvature @xmath42 scales like @xmath86 .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising since @xmath19 is much smaller than the gap width @xmath87 estimated from the spherical shape of the outer solution and , at present , we do not have an asymptotic argument for the appearance of the small scale @xmath88 .",
    "( by contrast , with a viscous outer fluid @xmath89 is _ larger _ than the gap width @xmath90 , and this scale can be understood from mass conservation as discussed in section iii b. )    inserting @xmath91 into ( [ log ] ) , we obtain @xmath92 for the velocity ( @xmath93 ) at the meniscus , which agrees with the asymptotic result given by hopper ( 1993a ) ; our earlier asymptotic analysis now allows the extension of this result to three dimensions .      for the case",
    "@xmath94 we begin by discussing the structure of the local solution close to the meniscus , which is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it consists of a `` bubble '' of outer fluid of radius @xmath95 , which is connected to a thin neck of width @xmath96 .",
    "the neck matches onto the static outer solution , so @xmath96 must scale like the gap width @xmath87 .",
    "the area of the original gap up to @xmath59 is @xmath97 so that , if the meniscus advances faster than fluid can escape from the gap , the bubble should contain a finite fraction of the gap fluid and hence @xmath98 .    to examine this argument in more detail",
    ", we consider the velocity field generated by the large curvature of the meniscus .",
    "as we have already noted , the flow is driven by that part of the interface where the interfacial curvature is significantly different from 1 ( or 2 in the spherical case ) , namely @xmath99 . using a multipole expansion of this forcing",
    ", we find the velocity field @xmath100 at a distance @xmath101 from the center @xmath102 of the bubble to be @xmath103 at leading order , where @xmath104 is given by ( [ 2d ] ) and @xmath105 is the total force exerted by the bubble .",
    "this force is the integral of @xmath106 over the bubbles surface ( @xmath107 ) , where @xmath108 is the tangent vector pointing in the direction of increasing arclength @xmath109 : @xmath110 in the present case @xmath111 , so that the far - field velocity resulting from the forcing of the bubble and its image is @xmath112.{\\bf e}_y\\ ] ]    we are interested in the flow in the neck , so we choose @xmath113 with @xmath114 . from ( [ 2d ] ) and ( [ multi ] ) we find that the @xmath115-component of velocity in the neck is given by @xmath116 the representation ( [ un ] ) breaks down when @xmath117 , since the higher - order terms in the multipole expansion become of comparable magnitude and @xmath118 crosses over to some function that depends on the detailed structure of the bubble .",
    "since ( [ un ] ) must match onto the velocity field in the bubble , we can write the velocity of the meniscus as @xmath119 where the constant @xmath120 comes from the detailed shape of the bubble , and for @xmath56 is found numerically to be @xmath121 .",
    "( this equation is consistent with ( [ log ] ) , but also includes a representation of the @xmath122 contribution . )    if @xmath123 then from ( [ un ] ) and ( [ v ] ) @xmath124 thus the fluid in the neck ahead of the bubble only starts to move at a speed comparable to that of the bubble when @xmath125 i.e. when the bubble has caught up with it .",
    "thus all the fluid in the neck is collected into the advancing and growing bubble . since the neck width @xmath96 scales like @xmath10 , the total area of neck collected scales like @xmath126 , and thus @xmath127    finally , combining ( [ vol ] ) with ( [ v ] ) or ( [ tlog ] ) , we find that @xmath128 which can be integrated to give @xmath129 this result differs by a factor of @xmath130 from the @xmath131 limit .      to test the predictions of these scaling ideas ,",
    "we have performed extensive two - dimensional simulations of drop coalescence using the boundary - integral method .",
    "the initial bridge has @xmath132 , which means the gap width is @xmath133 initially . for simplicity",
    ", we only considered the viscosity matched case @xmath94 so that the second term drops out from ( [ int ] ) and @xmath57 can be computed directly from the surface forces .",
    "the interface was parameterized by arclength , and derivatives were evaluated using centered differences .",
    "the interface was advanced according to ( [ marker ] ) , using an explicit second - order runge - kutta step .",
    "the difference between the result of time step @xmath134 and two half - steps @xmath135 was used to control the time step .",
    "improvement of the stability of our numerical method by making it implicit would be computationally very demanding for an integral operator .",
    "instead , we use a scheme first proposed by douglas & dupont ( 1971 ) .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ marker ] ) for the position of the interface can be written at any given time as a linearization around the current interfacial position @xmath136 : @xmath137 by writing this as @xmath138 and treating the first part explicitly , but the second part implicitly , the scheme becomes unconditionally stable as long as @xmath139 , where the matrix norm is defined to be the modulus of the largest eigenvalue ( douglas & dupont 1971 ) . in the present case , @xmath140 scales like @xmath141 up to logarithmic corrections , where @xmath142 is the minimum grid spacing . by choosing @xmath143 to be a diffusion operator multiplied by the local grid spacing , one can make sure that the numerical method , although treating the integral operator explicitly , becomes unconditionally stable . without the help of this trick",
    "the time steps required to integrate over the first decade and a half in @xmath59 would have been prohibitively small .",
    "to achieve the necessary spatial resolution , local refinement of the mesh is crucial .",
    "the resolution near the meniscus was set by the inverse of the local curvature .",
    "away from the inner solution , the grid spacing was allowed to taper off geometrically , with the spacing constrained to change by no more than 10% from one grid point to the next .",
    "as explained in more detail below , additional resolution was used in the transition region where the bubble merges into the neck .",
    "the maximum number of points used to represent one quadrant of the shape was about 900 .",
    "every few time steps a new grid was constructed using the current interface , and the interface was interpolated to the new grid .",
    "thus there was no need to rearrange the grid points along the interface .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the scaling of the bubble radius @xmath25 and the minimum neck radius @xmath96 and observe that both follow the predicted power laws ( [ vol ] ) .",
    "a closer inspection shows that the slope of @xmath144 is slightly smaller than expected , which is because the scaling of the area of the bubble is almost the same as that of the neck .",
    "( the portion of the neck up to the point @xmath145 contributes an area @xmath146 , which is only slightly smaller than @xmath147 since the two exponents are close . )",
    "we confirmed numerically that the @xmath59-dependence of the total area @xmath148 has no significant deviation from @xmath149 , as expected .",
    "the scaling of the velocity at the meniscus ( @xmath150 ) and in the neck ( @xmath151 ) at position @xmath152 is shown in figure [ fig4 ] ( with @xmath153 ) and compared with @xmath154 , which is predicted by equations ( [ v ] ) and ( [ una ] ) to have the same slope .",
    "the theory gives @xmath155= constant = @xmath156 which is found numerically to be very close to @xmath157 and hence @xmath121 .",
    "all three curves in figure [ fig4 ] should have a slope @xmath158 when plotted against @xmath159 .",
    "the noticeable deviation comes from the fact that one is effectively taking the _ difference _ between @xmath160 and @xmath161",
    ", so non - asymptotic effects in @xmath25 , still present on these small scales , become more pronounced .",
    "it has been implicit in the previous arguments that the inner solution , consisting of a bubble connected to a thin neck , has reached its asymptotic form : in the frame of reference of the advancing bubble tip , and rescaled by the bubble radius , the shape should be stationary .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] , showing both the local interface profile and the curvature at two values of @xmath59 one decade apart , reveals that there is , in fact , a slow variation in part of the local profile .",
    "this slow variation is seen as a positive second peak in the curvature at the point where the bubble meets the neck . to be able to resolve scales down to @xmath162 ,",
    "additional grid points were inserted at the position of the second peak , where the grid spacing was based on the width of the peak . as @xmath163 , which corresponds to going back in time , the second curvature peak increases and also gets narrower , as its integral",
    "must be finite to yield a finite change of slope .    to obtain more information about the asymptotic shape of the inner solution and the growth of the secondary peak in curvature , it is useful to consider the inner solution as a separate problem .",
    "this analysis is given in the next section .",
    "here we study the local solution close to the meniscus , which consists of a bubble of radius @xmath25 connected to a thin neck of width @xmath96 ( see inset to figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "asymptotically , the curvature of the neck is very small compared with @xmath164 , so the neck can effectively be considered as an infinitely long channel of uniform width . from now",
    "on , all lengths will be measured in units of @xmath25 , so the radius of the bubble is normalized to unity , and the radius of the neck asymptotes to some small number @xmath165 .",
    "the solution we are interested in , which corresponds to the asymptotic structure of the main solution described in section iii , is such that the interfacial shape @xmath166 is advected at a constant speed @xmath167 without changing its shape @xmath168 the physical meaning of this statement is that in the original problem the local solution relaxes to a quasi - steady shape on a much shorter timescale than the position @xmath1 of the meniscus is changing .",
    "the velocity field of the local steadily translating shape ( [ conv ] ) must satisfy @xmath169 the boundary condition is that @xmath170 approaches @xmath171 as @xmath172 .",
    "the components of the velocity field @xmath173 and @xmath174 follow from the integral equation ( [ int ] ) as usual . instead of solving the system ( [ int ] ) and ( [ stat ] ) directly , we found it most convenient to evolve two bubbles attached to a very long , straight neck of radius @xmath175 until a stationary shape is established , as shown in the inset to figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the tension in the neck is responsible for pulling the bubble along .",
    "the neck shortens during the relaxation and the radius increases to a value @xmath171 , which then only changes very slowly by the time a stationary shape is reached .",
    "since the radius of the bubble @xmath25 and the radius of the neck @xmath96 are very different , one might think that the curvature distribution within the bubble is independent of the neck radius @xmath171 .",
    "however , the limit @xmath176 turns out to be singular as an increasingly pronounced peak of positive curvature appears at the junction between bubble and neck , as demonstrated in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "first , in figure [ fig7 ] we compare the curvature distribution as given in figure [ fig5 ] for @xmath177 with that of the stationary problem , equations ( [ int ] ) and ( [ stat ] ) , with @xmath178 .",
    "we choose @xmath175 such that the neck has the appropriate width @xmath171 by the time a stationary shape is reached .",
    "the excellent agreement shows that the flow close to the meniscus is completely equivalent to the translating bubble , which is of course a much simpler problem .",
    "hence the inner solution of the coalescence problem can be understood completely in terms of the translating bubble .",
    "figure [ fig8](a ) shows a sequence of bubble shapes for increasingly small values of @xmath171 .",
    "the overall shape of the bubble does not depend very much on @xmath171 , and it looks as if the shapes are almost the same for the two smallest values .",
    "however there is an increasingly sharp `` corner '' at the point where the neck meets the bubble .",
    "this result is most evident from a plot of the curvature for the same values of @xmath171 ; see figure [ fig8](b ) .",
    "while the curvature of the bubble is negative , the corner at the junction between the bubble and the neck corresponds to a growing peak of positive curvature . in figure [ fig8](b ) we also include a plot of the maximum of this peak as a function of @xmath171 .",
    "the data is suggestive of @xmath179 though it is hard to make a definite statement .",
    "if this is so then the lengthscale of the corner is the geometric mean of the scales of the bubble and the neck , which would be @xmath13 in the coalescence problem . from ( [ force ] )",
    "it is evident that the total force exerted by the peak is equal to the change in slope . as can be seen from figure [ fig8 ] ( a )",
    "the change is constant to a good approximation so that , of the total force @xmath72 exerted by the bubble , roughly 15% is exerted by the corner and 85% by the rest of the bubble .",
    "as we have demonstrated , even the simplest case of viscosity - matched fluids represents a problem of enormous complexity , in which there are features on at least the lengthscales @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath1 and 1 .",
    "therefore , we confined ourselves to computing the leading - order asymptotics , which we note are only logarithmically dominant . in all likelihood , quantities like the bubble radius @xmath180 contain additional logarithmic terms , whose calculation require a better knowledge of the matched asymptotics of the problem .",
    "further complications arise because the inner solution is itself singular , with a corner of lengthscale which we estimate to be @xmath181 .",
    "important goals for future work would be confirmation of the inner scalings , formal asymptotic matching of the different scales , and to go beyond the leading - order problem .",
    "another important problem is the generalization of our calculations to arbitrary viscosity ratios @xmath70 .",
    "a major obstacle to developing a quantitative theory for general @xmath70 is that numerical simulations are much more difficult . when @xmath182 ( [ int ] ) is a second - kind integral equation for @xmath183 , which requires an order @xmath184 effort to solve instead of @xmath185 .",
    "moreover , for small @xmath1 the matrix associated with the second integral becomes singular since the local solution for the velocity field is close to a uniform translation for which the kernel has a zero eigenvalue .",
    "we have not yet found a way to treat this singularity sufficiently well to go beyond @xmath1-values of @xmath186 for @xmath182 .",
    "we have argued already that we expect the leading - order behaviour of @xmath187 to be given by ( [ log ] ) for any @xmath70 since the net force from the meniscus is supported asymptotically by the internal fluid .",
    "we also believe that the scaling @xmath188 will hold as @xmath18 for any finite @xmath70 since , even for large @xmath70 ( small external viscosity ) , the pressure drop along a narrow channel is large and so the outer fluid is not able to escape from the gap and is caught in a bubble . expressed differently , the positive curvature at the bubble corner is unable to pull the walls of the channel apart since this would require significant motion along the channel .",
    "it is intriguing that hopper s exact solution shows that the situation is very different for @xmath131 when there is no external viscous resistance to overcome and no bubble forms ( figure 2a ) .",
    "thus the limits @xmath189 and @xmath18 do not commute , reflecting the fact that one must be careful in assuming a zero - stress condition in situations involving narrow cusps , as even a very small external viscosity can be significant .    we can provide a physical estimate for the scale below which a bubble forms for @xmath190 . fluid motion in the narrow gap may be treated with the lubrication approximation , whence @xmath191 and @xmath192 gives the estimate @xmath193 .",
    "therefore , a bubble can only be expected to form when the meniscus motion @xmath194 , which occurs on an approximate lengthscale @xmath195 .",
    "we have been considering the simplest case of equal spheres brought into contact .",
    "the case of unequal spheres of radii @xmath0 and @xmath196 , with @xmath197 is a straightforward generalization in which the gap thickness ( [ w ] ) is simply replaced by @xmath198 similar considerations show that the initial evolution of axisymmetric drops brought into contact along their symmetry axes depends only on the local curvature at the initial contact .",
    "an more interesting variation is that of general initial shapes for which the locus of high curvature ( in three dimensions ) near contact no longer forms a circle , but is a more general closed curve . to leading order ,",
    "this curve is convected with a logarithmically large velocity field , pointing in the direction normal to the curve .",
    "recent research ( nikolayev _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; bonnecaze _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) has suggested that the rate of coalescence in emulsions can be greatly enhanced by the flow generated by individual coalescence events .",
    "our analysis suggests that an appropriate model for the far - field velocity of a single coalescence event is the stokes flow driven by an expanding ring force of radius @xmath59 and strength @xmath24 per unit length .",
    "this dipolar flow , which may be obtained by solving @xmath199 using hankel transforms @xcite , is      where the @xmath200 are bessel functions .",
    "these equations can be approximated in the limit @xmath201 to obtain the axisymmetric dipole @xmath202 , \\ ] ] which is shown in figure [ fig9 ] superimposed on the outlines of two spherical bubbles .",
    "the coalescence - induced radially directed force drives a flow towards the two drops over an angle @xmath203 .",
    "the flow ( [ rapprox ] ) might be used for simplicity in models of multiple coalescence .",
    "all motions described so far begin with a local point contact and it is worth considering how this contact might be achieved .",
    "the near - contact squeezing motion generated when two drops ( or a drop and a plane ) are in relative motion can be analyzed using the lubrication approximation ( e.g. jones & wilson 1978 ; yiantsos & davis 1991 ) .",
    "owing to the large pressures accompanying flow along the narrow gap , the surface tends to deform in the narrow gap . in particular ,",
    "when two equal size drops are squeezed together with a force @xmath204 on each drop , then a dimple tends to form when @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the minimum gap spacing and @xmath0 the radius of curvature of the undeformed drop .",
    "the magnitude of the deformation becomes the same order of magnitude as the gap height and the dimple has a radial scale @xmath207 .",
    "away from the gap the drop is nearly spherical so long as , for @xmath208 , the effective capillary number is small , @xmath209 .",
    "an implication of these analyses is that contact is very likely to occur along a rim , or at least at an off - axis position , with an initial radius of the bridge of order @xmath210 .",
    "the dynamics would then follow the results shown in section iii .    from an experimental point of view , it is probably not relevant to investigate smaller ( dimensionless ) @xmath1 than @xmath211 since the gap width just ahead of the bubble is proportional to @xmath10 , which is then of microscopic size for reasonable values of @xmath0 .",
    "very small inhomogeneities in the fluid or van der waals attractions will cause the two interfaces to reconnect , and to create an instability that breaks the azimuthal symmetry we have assumed in the three - dimensional problem .",
    "moreover , the bubble actually forms a structure that resembles a long thin torus in three dimensions , and is thus prone to a rayleigh capillary instability , which grows on a short timescale proportional to @xmath25 and is potentially dangerous . on the other hand ,",
    "there are stabilizing effects since the bubble is also convected ( brenner , shi & nagel 1994 ) , and a careful nonlinear stability analysis has to be done to determine the scale where the stability is first expected to occur .",
    "this question is experimentally relevant because it sets the size of small bubbles of the outer fluid that may be observed after coalescence .",
    "we have pointed out that coalescence is initially described by the stokes equations .",
    "if the viscosity of the fluid is small , this is true only for the early stages of coalescence , until the reynolds number is of order one , which happens when @xmath212 for water , @xmath213 , so it is a very relevant question to go beyond the stokes approximation . after passing the transition region ( [ ln ] )",
    "we expect the dynamics to be described by the euler equations .",
    "assuming that the scale of the local solution at the meniscus is set by the gap width alone , the interfacial stress driving this motion is approximately @xmath214 , which is to be the same magnitude as @xmath215 .",
    "hence , with @xmath216 , we find @xmath217 which corresponds to @xmath218 . the geometrical part of both problems is similar to the stokes case , but the coupling between pressure and velocity makes the relationship between the surface shape and the velocity different , so an alternative treatment is needed to predict the numerical coefficient in front of the power law for @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , the possibility of finite reynolds number , arbitrary surface shape , finite velocity of approach , and the inclusion of another fluid outside the drops lends a tremendous richness to the class of singularities studied here .",
    "we are indebted to stephane zaleski for bringing the authors together and for sharing his deep insight .",
