    "in 1932 , carleman  @xcite considered the problem of finding a harmonic function , in a plane bounded domain , satisfying a nonlocal condition which connects the values of the unknown function at different points of the boundary .",
    "further investigation of elliptic problems with transformations mapping a boundary onto itself as well as with abstract nonlocal conditions has been carried out by vishik  @xcite , browder  @xcite , beals  @xcite , antonevich  @xcite , and others .    in 1969 ,",
    "bitsadze and samarskii  @xcite considered the following nonlocal problem arising in the plasma theory : to find a function @xmath0 harmonic on the rectangular @xmath1 , continuous on @xmath2 , and satisfying the relations @xmath3 where @xmath4 are given continuous functions .",
    "this problem was solved in  @xcite by reducing it to a fredholm integral equation and using the maximum principle . for arbitrary domains and general nonlocal conditions ,",
    "such a problem was formulated as an unsolved one ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "different generalizations of nonlocal problems with transformations mapping the boundary inside the closure of a domain were studied by many authors  @xcite .",
    "the most complete theory for elliptic equations of order @xmath5 with general nonlocal conditions was developed by skubachevskii and his students  @xcite : a classification with respect to types of nonlocal conditions was suggested , the fredholm solvability in the corresponding spaces was investigated , and asymptotics of solutions near special conjugation points was obtained .",
    "note that , besides the plasma theory , nonlocal elliptic problems have interesting applications to biophysics and theory of diffusion processes  @xcite , control theory  @xcite , theory of functional differential equations , mechanics  @xcite , and so on .",
    "the most difficult situation in the theory of nonlocal problems is that where the support of nonlocal terms can intersect the boundary of a domain . in this case",
    ", solutions of nonlocal problems can have power - law singularities near some points of the boundary even if the right - hand side is infinitely differentiable and the boundary is infinitely smooth  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to the question of distinguishing some classes of nonlocal problems whose solutions are sufficiently smooth , provided that the right - hand side of the problem is smooth .",
    "until now , this issue was studied only for nonlocal perturbations of the dirichlet problem for second - order elliptic equations  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the smoothness of solutions for _ elliptic equations of higher order with general nonlocal conditions in plane domains .",
    "_ unlike the theory of elliptic problems in nonsmooth domains , the violation of smoothness of solutions for nonlocal problems is connected not only with the fact that the boundary may contain singular points but rather with the presence of nonlocal terms in the boundary conditions .",
    "we illustrate some of the occurring phenomena with the following example .",
    "let @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are open ( in the topology of @xmath8 ) @xmath9 curves ; @xmath10 are the end points of the curves @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "suppose that the domain @xmath13 is the plane angle of opening @xmath14 in some neighborhood of each of the points @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we deliberately take a smooth domain to illustrate how the nonlocal terms can affect the smoothness of solutions .",
    "consider the following problem in the domain @xmath13 : @xmath17 @xmath18 here @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are real - valued @xmath9 functions ; @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) are @xmath9 diffeomorphisms taking some neighborhood @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) of the curve @xmath7 ( @xmath26 ) onto the set @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) in such a way that @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the transformation @xmath22 , near the points @xmath32 , is the rotation of the boundary @xmath7 through the angle @xmath33 inwards the domain @xmath13 ( respectively , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and the approach of the curve @xmath36 to the boundary @xmath8 can be arbitrary , cf .",

    "the closure of the set @xmath37 is referred to as the _ support of nonlocal terms_.    denote by @xmath38 the sobolev space .",
    "we say that a function @xmath39 is a _ generalized solution _ of problem  , with right - hand side @xmath40 , @xmath41 if @xmath42 satisfies nonlocal conditions   ( the equalities are understood as those in @xmath43 ) and eq .   in the sense of distributions .",
    "assume that @xmath44 .",
    "then one can show that any generalized solution of problem  , belongs to the space @xmath45 outside of an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the points @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "clearly , the behavior of solutions near the points @xmath15 and @xmath16 is affected by the behavior of the coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 near these points . however , the influence of the coefficients @xmath46 is principally different from that of the coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "this phenomenon is explained by the fact that the coefficients @xmath46 ( for @xmath47 being in a small neighborhood of the points @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) correspond to nonlocal terms supported _ near _ the set @xmath48 ( in the general case , such terms correspond to operators @xmath49 ) , whereas the coefficient @xmath21 corresponds to a nonlocal term supported _ outside _ of some neighborhood of the set @xmath48 ( in the general case , such terms correspond to abstract operators @xmath50 ) .",
    "it was proved in  @xcite that the smoothness of generalized solutions preserves if @xmath51 or @xmath52 and can be violated if @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath54 , we have the `` border '' case : the smoothness of generalized solutions depends on the fulfillment of some integral consistency condition imposed on the right - hand sides @xmath55 and the coefficients @xmath46 .",
    "now we illustrate another phenomenon arising in the border case .",

    "[ sectstatement ] , we provide the setting of nonlocal problem and introduce the notion of a generalized solution @xmath63 of the problem for any integral @xmath64 .    it turns out that the smoothness of generalized solutions essentially depends on the location of eigenvalues and the structure of root functions of some auxiliary nonlocal operator @xmath65 , @xmath66 , corresponding to the conjugation points .",
