    "laboratory measurements of the absorption coefficients of interstellar grain analogs at submm / mm wavelengths have revealed an intrinsic temperature dependence of grain absorption coefficient and emissivity index ( agladze et al .",
    "1996 ; mennella et al .",
    "agladze et al .",

    "these authors found a monotonic increase of the absorption coefficient with dust temperature , while the emissivity index was found to range from 0.5 to 2.3 and decrease as the dust temperature increases .",
    "we conclude the inverse correlation observed in our local lirg sample is statistically significant and physically real , and offer three possible explanations .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ equi_td1 ] ) tells us that the equilibrium dust temperature displays a negative dependence on the emissivity index , for a given radiation field and grain material .",
    "second , the grain emissivity index has intrinsic negative temperature dependence , as evidenced by laboratory measurements (   [ lab ] ) .",
    "this effect can be understood by considering the schlmann ( 1964 ) model which treats an amorphous solid as an ionic crystal with a random charge distribution . within this framework ,",
    "the absorption spectrum is dominated by photon - to - phonon coupling at all frequencies .",
    "we argue that the observed negative temperature dependence of grain emissivity index is attributed to the decreasing grain dimension ( @xmath71 ) at higher temperatures ( i.e. , grain structure becomes more `` open '' ) , which results in a flatter frequency dependence of the phonon mode density and consequently lower emissivity indices at higher dust temperatures ( yang  2006 ) .",
    "third , an inverse relation can be caused by mixtures of non - uniform grain populations , particularly those involving very small grains or grains covered with ice mantles .",
    "@xmath9values as high as 3.5 have been predicted for dust grains covered with ice mantles ( aannestad 1975 ) , whereas very small grains are expected to have @xmath72 ( seki & yamamoto  1980 ) .",
    "at the same time , low dust temperatures favor formation of ice mantles and lead to strong emission at longer wavelengths , while high dust temperatures ( or temperature fluctuations ) in very small grains prohibit accretion of ice mantles and give rise to strong emission at shorter wavelengths . as a result",
    ", the dust temperature and emissivity index observed in the large - scale tend to move in the direction of low-@xmath55-high-@xmath9when the overall dust emission is dominated by that of cold dust possibly covered with ice mantles , while @xmath4and @xmath9shift in the direction of high-@xmath55-low-@xmath9when very small grains dominate the overall emission .      a relation ,",
    "if established over a wide range of dusty galaxies , would be extremely useful for modeling their observed far - ir / submm seds , as it effectively reduces the number of variables ( therefore the number of required flux measurements ) by one in the sed fitting .",
    "this effect is especially desirable for studying faint , distant submm sources and interpreting results from single submm wavelength imaging and deep field surveys , given the considerable observational challenge typically faced by deep submm observations . for a given photometric dataset , a relation either allows the estimate of one more parameter in the sed fitting , or improves the uncertainties associated with the fitted variables , as exemplified by the sed modeling of a sample of intermediate - redshift ulirgs ( yang  2006 ) , for which the sampling of the far - ir / submm sed is limited to three wavelengths . by using the relation , both the dust temperature and emissivity index",
    "can be fitted , which represents a major advance over the more conventional and commonly utilized sed modeling method , which , without the application of a relation , would only fit for one of the two very important parameters .",
    "we have observed and detected 18 local lirgs ( @xmath20 ) at 350@xmath0 m , using the sharc - ii camera at the cso . the acquired 350@xmath0 m  data , in combination with pre - existing far - ir / submm / mm photometric data , lead to accurate estimates of sed properties of these galaxies .",
    "we find sample medians of dust temperature ( ) , emissivity index ( ) , far - ir luminosity ( ) and dust mass ( ) .",
    "an inverse correlation , best described by , is established for our local lirg sample .",
    "this effect is most likely caused by intrinsic interdependence between the dust temperature and emissivity index as physical parameters , as revealed by laboratory measurements (   [ lab ] ) , as as well as variations in grain properties in the ism .",
    "the establishment of a relation is extremely useful in the far - ir / submm sed fittings of dusty galaxies , as it serves to effectively reduce the number of free parameters by one in the sed function .",
