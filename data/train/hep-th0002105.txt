    "quantum electrodynamics in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions ( qed@xmath10 ) is an interesting theoretical laboratory in which to explore , in a simpler environment , some of the fundamental features of more complicated four - dimensional gauge theories , such as chiral symmetry breaking and confinement ; it may also be of direct physical relevance in some condensed matter systems  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall be concerned with @xmath1-flavour qed@xmath10 at finite temperature , in its parity invariant ( four - component ) form .",
    "our aim is two - fold : to cast some light on the nature of the phase transition associated with the dynamical generation of fermion mass ( the `` chiral phase transition '' ) ; and to argue for a dynamical interplay between the chiral phase transition and the confinement - deconfinement one .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking ( `` csb '' ) , or equivalently dynamical fermion mass generation , in qed@xmath10 at @xmath11 has been extensively studied using schwinger - dyson equations , in the large @xmath1 limit  @xcite .",
    "though the approximations are admittedly not fully controlled , all calculations show that a fermion mass is dynamically generated for @xmath12 , thereby spontaneously breaking the chiral symmetry .",
    "but the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite forbids the occurrence of an order parameter transforming non - trivially under chiral transformations in this two - dimensional system .",
    "one presumes , therefore , that the transition at @xmath13 is of the bkt type  @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge there has been no explicit demonstration of this  for example , by mapping ( or otherwise relating ) the theory to one with a known bkt transition , which could then be identified with the csb transition in qed@xmath10 .    on the other hand , in a quite independent development , grignani et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that , when chiral symmetry is _ explicitly _ broken by a fermion mass @xmath4 in the lagrangian , the relevant effective theory ( at least in a certain region of parameter space ) has a bkt transition at a temperature @xmath14 , which the authors interpret as a confinement - deconfinement phase transition .",
    "it is natural to ask , first , whether the analysis of  @xcite can be extended to the case in which the fermion mass is dynamically generated , rather than appearing explicitly in the lagrangian ; and secondly , whether the resulting effective theory leads us any nearer to an understanding of the chiral phase transition , and of any possible connection between the two transitions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to make a first attempt at answering these questions",
    ".    it will be helpful to recall the argument of grignani et al .",
    "@xcite . according to them ,",
    "confinement in qed@xmath10 at @xmath15 can be probed by an abelian analogue of the polyakov loop operator , namely @xmath16    where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 integer @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the charge of the dynamical fermions in the theory .",
    "the euclidean path integral for the partition function is invariant under gauge transformations @xmath21 , where    @xmath22    the group of all gauge transformations modulo those which are strictly periodic is @xmath23 , the additive group of integers ; this @xmath23-symmetry is a global symmetry . under a @xmath23-transformation ,",
    "@xmath24    if @xmath23-symmetry is unbroken , then @xmath25 and the system confines @xmath26 charges ; if @xmath23-symmetry is spontaneously broken ( as it can be , with an order parameter , being discrete ) , then @xmath27 and the @xmath26 charges are deconfined .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , it is possible to choose a gauge in which @xmath3 is independent of @xmath28 . in this gauge ,",
    "@xmath29    and @xmath23-transformations are    @xmath30    under which @xmath31 transforms as in ( [ ptrans ] ) .",
    "the effective field theory for @xmath32 is then the effective action for the static field @xmath33 , which is obtained by integrating out the other degrees of freedom from the path integral .",
    "the resulting effective action is in general non - local and non - polynomial , but it must still obey the @xmath23-symmetry periodicity :    @xmath34 = s_{eff}[e_{f } \\beta a_0 ( \\vec{x } ) + 2 \\pi n].\\ ] ]    a local approximation can be obtained by expanding @xmath35 in powers of derivatives of @xmath36 divided by the ( langrangian ) fermion mass @xmath4 . in such an expansion , the effective potential is obtained from the fermion determinant in the presence of a constant background field @xmath3  and it has to be periodic as in ( [ strans ] ) .",
    "it is , one might think , very likely that such a potential should be essentially of `` sine - gordon '' type , and indeed this is what the authors of  @xcite were able to show , provided that    @xmath37    ( see also section ii.a below ) . in this regime ,",
    "the critical behaviour of the effective theory for @xmath36 is that of the 2-d sine - gordon model , which has a line of critical points along which a bkt transition occurs , separating confining and deconfining regions of parameter space . the critical temperature is    @xmath38    up to one - loop order .",
    "thus the confinement - deconfinement transition has been shown to be of bkt type , by demonstrating that the relevant effective field theory has this critical behaviour .",
    "consider now how dynamical ( fermion ) mass generation ( dmg ) might fit into this picture .",
    "our basic idea is to see if it might be consistent for the dynamically generated mass @xmath6 to play the role of the lagrangian mass @xmath4 in the analysis of  @xcite . to investigate dmg",
    ", we shall use schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations as previously , but here with one important difference : we wish to safeguard the crucial invariance ( [ strans ] ) .",
    "we shall therefore split @xmath3 into its slowly varying @xmath39 and fluctuating @xmath40 parts , and - as a first approximation - solve the sd equations for the fermion and @xmath41-field propagators in the presence of the uniform @xmath8 which , at this stage , plays the role of an external parameter , and which may be `` large '' .",
    "the fermion self - energy equation will produce a dynamically generated mass @xmath6 for every set of external parameters ( in an appropriate region of parameter space ) and for each @xmath8 .",
    "the low momentum components of @xmath3 are then treated as in  @xcite with @xmath4 replaced by @xmath6 ; for the analysis to go through as before we shall need to find that @xmath6 does not depend too strongly on @xmath8 , at least in some parameter region .",
    "this picture will only be consistent if ( c.f .",
    "( [ mcond ] ) ) the generated @xmath6 satisfies the condition    @xmath42    with , of course , @xmath12 . in this case",
    ", we can tentatively associate the generation of fermion mass with the occurrence of a confining phase .    of course ,",
    "the fermion and gauge dynamics of @xmath41 are coupled : the vacuum polarisation function will be the bubble diagram evaluated in the @xmath8-background , and using the dynamically generated mass @xmath6 , which also depends on @xmath8 .",
    "we shall see that in the low - temperature confined phase , where @xmath3 is fluctuating about the trivial minimum of the sine - gordon potential , the properties of the gauge field propagator differ little from those in the normal @xmath43 case .",
    "however , for @xmath3 configurations fluctuating near a position of unstable equilibrium for the s - g potential  which may be associated with the onset of the deconfining phase transition  we find that an instability develops in the vacuum polarisation , which threatens to destroy the non - zero gap solution and so restore chiral symmetry . there is an indication here , therefore , for an intimate connection between the chiral and the confining transitions .",
    "unfortunately , our method does not allow us to explore the behaviour close to the phase transitions in any detail .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in section ii we define the model and discuss the formalism used to study confinement and csb simultaneously . in section iii",
    "we calculate the vacuum polarisation in the presence of @xmath8 . in section",
    "iv we write down the self- consistent gap equation in the presence of @xmath8 , and present numerical results together with our conclusions .",
    "an appendix discusses the error due to neglecting the dynamics of the space components of the gauge field .",

    "this representation allows for the introduction of a parity - conserving mass term for the four - component fermions .",
    "this corresponds , in the two - component formalism , to mass terms with opposite signs for each fermion field within a given flavour .",
    "we shall here use a description that allows us to study the possibility of both chiral and deconfinement phase transitions simultaneously . note that the latter transition , as presented in  @xcite , is considered in terms of an _ effective action _ for @xmath3 , the time component of the gauge field .",
    "this effective action is derived in the static-@xmath3 gauge , performing a derivative expansion .",
    "the usual way to study the chiral phase transition is , on the other hand , to work with truncated schwinger - dyson equations ( sde s ) , an approximation which is justified in the large-@xmath1 limit .",
    "it is possible , as we shall see , to find a non - empty region in parameter space where the simplifying assumptions made for the study of each phase transition are indeed compatible .",
    "we shall briefly review here the derivation of the effective action for the field @xmath3 , for the case of massive fermions , following  @xcite .",
    "this effective action is the interesting object to study when dealing with the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "we will afterwards extend this procedure , in order to include the non - perturbative dynamics responsible for the chiral phase transition .",

    "it is important to remark that , in this analysis , the lagrangian mass @xmath4 has been regarded as a free parameter .",

    "the effective action ( [ ssg ] ) has been obtained by performing a derivative expansion . in consequence , when the @xmath3 field is regarded as dynamical , the effects due to its large momentum modes are either neglected , or improperly taken into account .",

    "the mass parameter used to perform the low - momentum expansion is proportional to the temperature , and one is then missing modes of the gauge field which may indeed be responsible for the generation of a dynamical mass for the fermions .",

    ".    we shall now give a formal derivation to justify this procedure . the definition of the effective action for the large field @xmath3 should now take into account the existence of the high momentum modes for @xmath54 . the natural way to proceed is to decompose the gauge field into its large and small components , as in ( [ aexp ] ) , where only up to two derivatives of @xmath103 will be kept , while @xmath82 is assumed to take care of the higher derivatives .",

    "eq.([sdeq ] ) is to be compared with eq.(20 ) of  @xcite , to which it reduces when @xmath161 ( note that the latter equation is in error by a factor of @xmath162 on the right hand side : `` @xmath163 '' should read `` @xmath164 '' , so that the @xmath165 results of  @xcite correspond to our @xmath166 results , etc . ; note also that our @xmath118 is equal to @xmath167 of  @xcite , but is the same as @xmath168 of  @xcite ) .",
    "the upper limit of integration in ( [ sdeq ] ) is taken to be unity , as in  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the momentum integral in the s - d equation for @xmath6 should really have an ir cutoff @xmath169 , given by a small fraction of @xmath6 , since the gauge field corresponds to the _ fluctuating _ part of @xmath3 .",
    "this should not make any difference to the solution of the equation , for all the cases where there is a non - vanishing @xmath6 , since there the ir behaviour of the integrand is smooth .",
    "we have verified numerically that indeed the solution to ( [ sdeq ] ) is insensitive to the introduction of a small infrared cutoff .    on the other hand ,",
    "when the only stable solution is @xmath170 , the ir cutoff would make a difference , but then the separation into low and high momentum modes collapses .",
    "again , this would correspond to the physics near to the transition , where our procedure is not applicable .",
    "we turn now to a discussion of the numerical solutions of ( [ sdeq ] ) , and their implications .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath171 as a function of @xmath172 for various values of @xmath173 , for the case @xmath174 . for @xmath175 ,",
    "the curve reproduces the known results of  @xcite . for @xmath176 ,",
    "a mass continues to be generated ; indeed , at a given temperature the mass increases with @xmath177 ( see figure 2 where @xmath178 is shown as a function of @xmath177 for fixed @xmath179 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath176 we can not probe temperatures below @xmath180 , since below this value the thermal mass goes negative , as remarked after ( [ mth ] ) . in fact , from ( [ fapp ] ) it is clear that when @xmath181 ( i.e. @xmath182 ) , @xmath118 reduces to @xmath183 , the zero temperature value .",
    "this is the reason why the curves all tend to @xmath184 as @xmath179 tends to @xmath185 .    in reality , the calculation should probably only be accepted for @xmath186 ( i.e. @xmath187 ) , since we must remember that , at @xmath188 , the sine - gordon potential in ( [ aux1 ] ) has a point of unstable equilibrium , while our mass calculation is understood as being performed around a stable minimum of the potential .",
    "inspection of figure 1 shows that the condition @xmath186 is met for the curves corresponding to @xmath189 and @xmath190 , but only for part of the @xmath191 curve , and for less of the @xmath192 curve .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath178 as a function of @xmath177 for various values of @xmath179 , also for the case @xmath166 . as before ,",
    "the curves tend to the zero - temperature value as @xmath177 tends to @xmath193 . for the values of @xmath179 and @xmath177 shown , the more conservative limit",
    "@xmath194 is always satisfied .",
    "the critical temperature for @xmath175 is near @xmath195 , which is why the curve for this value of @xmath179 `` divides '' the curves in figure 2",
    ".    we must now consider whether these results support our approach _ a posteriori_. first and most importantly , we need to check whether conditions ( [ conds ] ) hold",
    ". inspection of figure 1 shows that indeed the condition @xmath196 ( i.e. @xmath197 ) is met for small @xmath117 , say @xmath198 .",
    "the condition @xmath199 is less satisfactorily met , but it is not flagrantly violated .",
    "secondly , we see from figure 2 that , while there is certainly a dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath8 , it does not seem to be sufficiently rapid to call into question the effective s - g description of the deconfinement transition .    so far we have discussed the case @xmath166 , and we must now remember that some approximations we have made depend on the large-@xmath1 limit . however , it is well known ( see for example  @xcite and references therein ) that in the model considered here there is a critical value of @xmath1 , @xmath200 , above which chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "@xmath201 is typically in the region 1 - 3 .",
    "we shall therefore consider the case @xmath165 for definiteness . while @xmath165 is hardly a large value",
    ", there is evidence to suggest that the inclusion of terms which are higher order in @xmath202 will not alter the qualitative conclusions  @xcite .    in figure 3",
    "we present , for @xmath203 , the curves of @xmath178 as a function of @xmath179 , for two values of @xmath177 .",
    "we see that both the critical temperature and the value of @xmath178 at @xmath204 are reduced , but still there is an important fraction of parameter space where @xmath197 . as for the condition @xmath199 ,",
    "it is satisfied to the same extent as for the @xmath166 case , since going from @xmath166 to @xmath165 reduces both sides of that inequality by ( roughly ) a factor @xmath205 .",
    "we may conclude that we have demonstrated the feasibility of our approach , in which the dynamically generated @xmath6 replaces ( at least in a limited region of parameter space ) the lagrangian mass @xmath4 of  @xcite .",
    "we may therefore argue that in the @xmath5 case , dynamical generation of @xmath6 is associated with a low - temperature confining phase , via the emergence of an effective s - g theory .",
    "there is also an indication of a ( reciprocal ) effect of the gauge field dynamics on mass generation . as noted after eq .",
    "( [ mth ] ) , when @xmath206 the thermal mass goes negative , which would imply a singularity in ( [ sdeq ] ) due to the ensuing pole in the gauge field propagator in the euclidean region .",
    "we may interpret this as indicating that , as the gauge field fluctuates towards the value @xmath207 , which is an unstable stationary point of the s - g potential , the stability of the gap equation is lost , and mass generation ceases .",
    "interestingly , apparently similar special temperatures occur in a study of the gross - neveu model with an imaginary chemical potential  @xcite",
    ". clearly it would be desirable to consider more fully the coupled dynamics of the @xmath3 and fermion sectors , including an @xmath113-dependence for @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , as a first orientation , our procedure seems to be reasonably justified .",

    "he also acknowledges financial support from conicet and anpcyt ( argentina ) .",
    "this work was also supported by the british council and fundacin antorchas .",
    "in the sde s approach , one usually neglects the dynamics of the spatial components of the gauge field .",
    "this produces an error in the result of the self - consistent gap equation . in the evaluation of the effective action for @xmath3 ,",
    "on the other hand , the spatial components of the vacuum polarization tensor yield a wave function renormalization for the spatial components of @xmath54 .",
    "let us call @xmath208 the contribution arising from the integration over the spatial modes @xmath209 in ( [ sa ] ) .",
    "it is quite straightforward to see that @xmath210 @xmath211 where the tilde denotes fourier transform . in the static @xmath3 gauge",
    "there is a remaining gauge invariance under space dependent gauge transformations , which implies that the function @xmath212 is spatially transverse : @xmath213    fixing these gauge field components",
