    "the position angle of the observations was 258.45 .",
    "the data were reduced and analyzed using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software ( release v1.1 , see http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao ) . the level  1 data were processed using the quantum efficiency uniformity file for @xmath40  c , which corrects the effective area for loss due to charge transfer inefficiency .",
    "the correction compensates for the loss of events far from the readout , especially at high energies , and is relevant when fitting the total spectrum in the largest energy range .",
    "the data were filtered to include only the standard event grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 .",
    "all bad columns were removed by eye , as were the columns close to the border of each node , since the grade filtering is not efficient in these columns .",
    "we also identified flickering pixels in the images in the chip coordinates : for each chip , we checked photon arrival times for all pixels on which more than two photons were detected . if two or more photons were detected within an interval shorter than 7 seconds , they were considered flickering pixels and excluded from further analysis .",
    "as the brightest source ( cxo39 ) has a count rate of only 1 photon every @xmath42  seconds , this procedure should not affect our source catalog .",
    "the removal of columns and pixels reduces slightly the effective area of the detector , the result of which has been included when calculating the soft and hard exposure maps .",
    "time intervals with background rates larger than @xmath43 over the quiescent value ( @xmath44 counts s@xmath45 per chip in the @xmath46 kev band ) were removed .",
    "this procedure gave 60.7  ks of effective exposure out of the first observation , and 124  ks out of the second , for a total of 184.7  ks .",
    "the two observations are almost coincident on the sky , so that the total coverage is 298 arcmin@xmath47 .",
    "the two event files were merged into a single file , which was used in the reduction and analysis process .",
    "the astrometry of the two observations , contiguous in time , was perfectly consistent , as verified by registering the positions of the brightest sources on top of each other .",
    "we did not include data from the chips s-2 and s-3 in the following analysis , since the point spread function ( psf ) is very broadened ( @xmath48 arcsec ) and they would add a very little effective area even for high fluxes .",
    "[ xcolorfig ] shows the final , combined x - ray data , with a false - color mapping derived from the _ chandra _ energy bands .      a soft band from 0.5@xmath32  kev and a hard band from 2@xmath37  kev were used in the detection process to select a soft and hard source lists , as detailed below",
    ". the hard band detection window was cut at 7  kev since above this energy the effective area of _ chandra _ is decreasing , while the instrumental background is rising , giving very inefficient detection of sky photons .",
    "x - ray count rates in the above bands were used to calculate x - ray fluxes in a 0.5@xmath32  kev soft band and 2@xmath310  kev hard band , assuming an average x - ray spectrum .",
    "we ran source extractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) on the summed 0.5@xmath37 kev image binned by a factor of two ( one binned pixel corresponds to 0.982@xmath2 0.982 ) .",
    "since we are far from being background limited , the detection efficiency proved to be much higher for the 0.5@xmath37  kev image rather than the soft and hard bands separately .",
    "giacconi ( 2001 ) use the same procedure for their analysis of the _ chandra _ deep field - south ( cdf - s ) .",
    "source extractor parameters were chosen after extensive simulations , and we adopted an internal detection threshold signal - to - noise ( @xmath49 ) ratio of 2.4 , with a gaussian filter fwhm of 15 and a minimum area of 5 pixels . since source extractor is not tailored to work with a very low background , it gives a wrong estimate of the internal background . to tackle this problem",
    ", we built a smoothed map of the background computed from the data themselves in the corresponding band , after the removal of the sources down to a very low threshold .",
    "this background map was used as a weight ( variance ) map to define the detection threshold .",
    "this modified detection algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than the wavelet detection algorithm of rosati ( 1995 ) or the wavdetect algorithm in the ciao software ( freeman 2002 ) .",
    "table  1 presents the catalog of @xmath50  kev point sources identified in the combined image , selected as follows .",
    "we first measured the signal - to - noise ( @xmath49 ) ratio of all the candidate detections in circular extraction apertures . a radius @xmath51 was used , where @xmath52 is the modeled psf full - width at half - maximum , determined as a function of off - axis angle to reproduce the broadening of the psf .",
    "a minimum @xmath53 was used in the central regions .",
    "sources with @xmath54 within the extraction area were considered detections .",
    "this limit was chosen to proved a census of x - ray sources to faint flux levels , where the choice of source extractor parameters has already significantly reduced the number of spurious detections .",
    "we stress as a compromise between providing a census of x - ray sources to faint levels and limiting the contamination from false detections .",
    "we stress that the condition of having @xmath54 in the extraction area corresponds to a high significance detection  the faintest detected sources have more than 10 counts .",
    "these catalogs , obtained from the source extractor run and the a - posteriori @xmath49 cut , typically include less than five spurious sources as tested with simulations with the model of _ axaf _  response to x - rays ( marx ) software ( for a detailed description of the simulations , see tozzi et  al .",
    "2001 ) . after performing this procedure on the soft and hard images",
    "separately , we obtained the soft and hard catalogs .",
    "a combined catalog was then produced by matching the two .",
    "source counts were measured with simple aperture photometry within @xmath55 .",
    "the background for each source was calculated locally within an annulus of inner radius @xmath56 and an outer radius of @xmath57 .",
    "numerical simulations show that our aperture photometry systematically underestimates the net counts by 4% . for the following analysis",
    ", we have applied this aperture correction .    finally , we transformed the net count rate into energy flux in the soft 0.5@xmath32  kev band and in the hard 2@xmath310  kev band .",
    "the conversion factors used were @xmath58 in the soft band and @xmath59 in the hard band , assuming an absorbing column of @xmath60 @xmath61 ( galactic value ) and a photon index  @xmath62 .",
    "the uncertainties in the conversion factors reflect the range of possible values for the photon index , @xmath63 . as suggested by the spectral analysis of the stacked spectra , these values are representative of our sample ( see below ) . since the conversion factors were computed at the aimpoint , where the effective area of _",
    "chandra_/acis is at its maximum , the count rate of each source was corrected for vignetting .",
    "namely , the net count rate was multiplied by the ratio of the exposure map at the aimpoint to the value of the exposure map averaged within the extraction region .",
    "such a correction was done in the soft and hard bands separately .",
    "we detect 132 sources in the 0.5@xmath32  kev ( soft ) x - ray band down to a 2.1@xmath64 limiting flux of @xmath65 and 111 sources in the 2@xmath310  kev ( hard ) x - ray band down to a 2.1@xmath64 limiting flux of @xmath66 .",

    "astrometric positions were initially determined from the acis - i aspect solution .",
    "following comparison of x - ray source positions to the deep , ground - based imaging discussed in  4 , we refined the absolute pointing of the x - ray data with an offset of 109 west , 135 south , and no rotation .",
    "these offsets were determined by matching x - ray sources with greater than 25 total counts ( @xmath50  kev ) to @xmath67 sources .",
    "the positions presented in table  2 therefore match the astrometric frame of the spices survey .",
    "to compute the number counts in the soft and hard bands , we first calculate the sky coverage as a function of the flux .",
