    "recent observations have clearly indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating . according to einstein s general relativity ,",
    "this can only be realised if the pressure of the dominant component of the current universe is negative .",
    "these observations have triggered a renewed interest in the cosmological constant problem ( for recent reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "what is usually referred to as the `` old '' cosmological constant problem can be phrased as follows : why is the measured ( effective ) cosmological constant extremely close to zero ?",
    "one approach dealing with the cosmological constant problem is concerned with employing the effective field theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "lacking a full quantum theory of gravity , an effective field theory of gravity adopts the following point of view : in order to describe quantum phenomena at very large and cosmologically relevant distances , the precise physics at the shortest distance scales is irrelevant . in other words ,",
    "the effective field theory of gravity is the low energy limit of quantum gravity .",
    "it combines classical general relativity with knowledge of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes @xcite .    in order to describe these long distance effects accurately , one supplements the classical einstein - hilbert action with certain additional contributions .",
    "one of these additions is the trace anomaly or conformal anomaly which quantum field theories are known to exhibit @xcite .",
    "if the classical action is invariant under conformal transformations of the metric , the resulting stress - energy tensor is traceless . as an explicit example",
    ", one can easily verify that the trace of a massless , conformally coupled scalar field vanishes .",
    "in quantum field theory the stress - tensor is promoted to an operator .",
    "a careful renormalisation procedure renders its expectation value @xmath0 finite .",
    "however , inevitably , the renormalisation procedure results in general in a non - vanishing trace of the renormalised stress - energy tensor .",
    "classical conformal invariance can not be preserved at the quantum level .",
    "ever since its discovery , the trace anomaly has found many applications in various areas in physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative approach to the backreaction problem of quantum fluctuations on the background spacetime deals with quantum fields whose spectrum is nearly flat @xcite .",
    "consequently , the spectrum in the infrared is not suppressed and is therefore expected to yield a strong backreaction on the background spacetime .",
    "examples of such fields are the minimally coupled massless scalar and the graviton .      some authors stated that the trace anomaly could have effects on dark energy and the cosmological constant problem @xcite , whereas it has been argued by other authors that the trace anomaly could potentially provide us with a dynamical explanation of the cosmological constant problem @xcite . broadly speaking , the line of reasoning is as follows ( for a more in - depth review , we refer to @xcite ) . the new , conformal degree of freedom is usually parametrised by : @xmath1 according to the authors of e.g. @xcite , the trace anomaly can not be generated from a local finite term in the action , but rather stems from a non - local effective action that generates the conformal anomaly by variation with respect to the metric @xcite .",
    "it is this genuine non - locality of the trace anomaly , revealing a large distance effect of quantum physics , that is at the very foundation of its connection with the effective field theory of gravity .",
    "one then argues that the new conformal field should dynamically screen the cosmological constant , thus solving the cosmological constant problem .",
    "the proposal advocated in @xcite is very interesting and should be investigated further . before studying the effect of a new conformal degree of freedom ( [ conformaltransformation ] ) , we feel that firstly a proper complete analysis of the dynamics resulting from the effective action of the trace anomaly should be performed .",
    "this is what we pursue in this paper .",
    "according to the cosmological principle the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on the largest and cosmologically relevant scales .",
    "the cmb measurements @xcite constrain the inhomogeneities at order @xmath2 . moreover",
    ", the universe appears to be spatially flat .",
    "let us make the following observations .",
    "firstly , the cosmological principle dictates the use of the conformally flat flrw metric @xmath3 . hence ,",
    "inhomogeneous fluctuations of the metric tensor and in particular of the conformal part of the metric tensor ( [ conformaltransformation ] ) are observed and expected to be small at the largest scales , comparable to the hubble radius ( also in the early universe ) .    secondly , we are led to an essentially semiclassical analysis .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the stress energy tensor resulting in the trace anomaly has been calculated semiclassically . in a semiclassical analysis quantum fluctuations backreact on the background spacetime .",
    "phase transitions aside , quantum fluctuations naturally affect the homogeneous background _",
    "homogenously_. it is a well - known fact that quantum fluctuations can break certain symmetries present in de sitter @xcite , e.g. time translation invariance .",
    "however , we are not aware of quantum fluctuations breaking the homogeneity and isotropy of the background spacetime .    finally ,",
    "if quantum fluctuations compensate for or screen the cosmological constant , we must have @xmath4 .",
    "let us set : @xmath5 .",
    "stress energy conservation and metric compatibility immediately yield : @xmath6 .",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath7 must be a constant : @xmath8 .",
    "only homogeneous vacuum fluctuations can compensate the cosmological constant .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 does not break any of the symmetries of a maximally symmetric spacetime .",
    "hence , this form can not be used to study dynamical backreaction .",
    "the arguments above motivate a semiclassical approach to examining the connection between the cosmological constant and the trace anomaly .",
    "note that we do not consider a new , conformal degree of freedom ( [ conformaltransformation ] ) .",
    "hence , we do certainly not exclude any possible effect this ( inhomogeneous ) conformal degree of freedom might have on the cosmological constant .",
    "however , it is plausible that in order to address the link between the cosmological constant and the trace anomaly , a semiclassical analysis suffices .",
    "another application of the conformal anomaly can be found in what has become known as trace anomaly induced inflation : in the absence of a cosmological constant , the trace anomaly could provide us with an effective cosmological constant .",
    "originally , starobinsky @xcite realised that quantum one loop contributions of massless fields can source a de sitter stage .",
    "subsequently , the theory of trace anomaly induced inflation received significant contributions from @xcite .",
    "if one includes a cosmological constant , the theory of anomaly induced inflation is plagued by instabilities , which we will also come to address . the modified starobinsky model as advocated by @xcite , takes advantage of these instabilities to account for a graceful exit from inflation .",
    "it is argued that supersymmetry breaking changes the degrees of freedom such that it destabilises the quantum anomaly driven attractor and simultaneously stabilises the classical de sitter attractor .    improving on e.g. @xcite",
    ", we incorporate matter with a constant equation of state in the einstein field equations .",
    "we argue that it is simply inconsistent not to include matter .",
    "consider the following analogy : if we examine an empty universe with a cosmological constant only , there is no dynamics and the ( 00 ) einstein equation yields @xmath10 .",
    "matter drives the dynamics and @xmath11 can only be realised with @xmath12 .    in the literature ,",
    "if one solves the trace of the einstein field equations in a universe with a cosmological constant and trace anomaly , one solves , however , in reality for the dynamics in a universe filled with radiation . for it is only radiation with equation of state @xmath13 that does not contribute to the trace of the einstein field equation @xmath14 .",
    "this point has not been included in other papers",
    ". we will consider matter with constant but otherwise arbitrary equation of state @xmath15 , and not just ( implicitly ) radiation with @xmath13 .      in this paper",
    "we show that the cosmological constant problem can not be solved by taking account of the trace anomaly alone .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ tracing the einstein field equations and the trace anomaly ] we recall the basics of the conformal anomaly and discuss how to study its effect on the evolution of the universe by tracing the einstein field equations .    in section [ the effective action generating the trace anomaly ] , we derive the conformal anomaly from an effective action in flat homogeneous flrw spacetimes consisting of local quadratic geometric curvature invariants .",
    "since one usually adds infinite counterterms to cancel the radiative one loop divergences , we do not see any reason why we should exclude adding a gauss - bonnet counterterm to cancel the anomaly in flat flrw spacetimes . even though this term in the effective action is formally divergent , at the level of the equation of motion it yields a finite result .",
    "hence , the coefficients multiplying the curvature invariants in the trace anomaly are not uniquely specified by the anomaly .",
    "the physical coefficient , i.e. : the parameter that can be measured , receives contributions both from the trace anomaly and from possible counterterms cancelling divergences from the underlying ( and yet unknown ) fundamental theory .",
    "this motivates varying the coupling parameters multiplying the curvature invariants in the anomaly",
    ". we can thus study all possible effects of the anomaly on the evolution of our universe .",
    "in section [ the trace anomaly in quasi de sitter spacetime ] we study the evolution of a quasi de sitter universe in the presence of matter with constant equation of state , a cosmological constant and the trace anomaly . in quasi de sitter spacetime we assume , loosely speaking , that the hubble parameter is a slowly varying function of time .",
    "effectively , we truncate the expression of the exact trace anomaly and discard higher order derivative contributions .",
    "in section [ the trace anomaly in flrw spacetimes ] we generalise our analysis and study the evolution of an flrw universe again in the presence of matter with constant equation of state , a cosmological constant and the trace anomaly .",
    "we examine the exact trace anomaly and take all higher derivative contributions into account . as the dimensionality of the phase space increases , we must carefully perform a stability analysis of the late time asymptotes .",
    "the trace anomaly or the conformal anomaly in four dimensions is in general curved spacetimes given by @xcite : @xmath16 where :    [ traceanomaly2 ] @xmath17    where as usual @xmath18 is the riemann curvature tensor , @xmath19 its dual , @xmath20 the weyl tensor and @xmath21 and @xmath22 the ricci tensor and scalar , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath23 is the gauss - bonnet invariant .",
    "the general expression for the trace anomaly can also contain additional contributions if the massless conformal field is coupled to other long range gauge fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 appearing in ( [ traceanomaly1 ] ) are dimensionless quantities multiplied by @xmath27 and are given by :    [ traceanomaly3 ] @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the number of fields of spin 0 , 1/2 and 1 respectively ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath33 whereas @xmath34 in general .",
    "it turns out that the coefficient @xmath26 is regularisation dependent and is therefore not considered to be part of the true conformal anomaly .",
    "we take this into account and study the effect of @xmath26 on the stability of the solutions we are about to derive . for definiteness",
    ", we will assume that these parameters take their standard model values : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note if we were to include right - handed neutrinos , @xmath38 .",
    "one could also examine the numerical value of the coefficients ( [ traceanomaly3 ] ) for the late time universe . today s",
    "massless particle is just the photon , hence @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "let us specialise to flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker or flrw spacetimes in which the metric is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the scale factor of the universe in cosmic time @xmath44 . recall that a conformal transformation leaves the weyl tensor invariant .",
    "hence , in flrw spacetimes @xmath45 . given the flrw metric one can easily verify that :    [ quadraticcurvature ] @xmath46   \\label{quadraticcurvaturea } \\\\",

    "this would truncate the trace anomaly up to terms linear in @xmath50 yielding : @xmath51 we will examine both the exact form of the trace anomaly ( [ traceanomaly4 ] ) and its truncated form ( [ traceanomaly4b ] ) .    truncating the expression for the trace anomaly is motivated by the following realisation . in general backgrounds we need a non - local effective action to generate the trace anomaly in the equation of motion .",
    "the non - locality at the level of the effective action corresponds to an expansion in derivatives at the level of the equation of motion .",
    "generally , higher derivative contributions in an equation of motion have the tendency to destabilise a system unless the initial conditions are highly fine - tuned .",
    "formally , this is known as the theorem of ostrogradsky and its relevance to cosmology is outlined , for example , in @xcite .",
    "note that when @xmath52 the truncated version is exact .",
    "we discuss this further in section [ case ii : b=2b/3 ] . finally , note that although we have truncated equation ( [ traceanomaly4 ] ) to obtain ( [ traceanomaly4b ] ) , equation ( [ traceanomaly4b ] ) is still covariant .      from the einstein - hilbert action : @xmath53 where : @xmath54 the einstein field equations follow as usual as : @xmath55 of which the trace can easily be verified to be : @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "if one considers an empty universe with a cosmological constant , the ( 00 ) einstein field equation acts as a constraint equation for the hubble parameter and one simply finds @xmath10 as usual .",
    "however , for a non - empty universe , the ( 00 ) einstein field equation becomes a dynamical constraint .",
    "the bianchi identity for the left - hand side of equation ( [ efe1 ] ) straightforwardly results in stress - energy conservation for the right - hand side : @xmath58 because of stress - energy conservation , the ( 00 ) and the ( ij ) components of the einstein field equations are not independent .",
    "therefore , any linear combination of the ( 00 ) and ( ij ) components of the einstein field equations combined with stress - energy conservation suffice to describe the time evolution of the hubble parameter .",
    "in particular , the trace equation ( [ efetrace1 ] ) and stress - energy conservation ( [ stressenergytensor1 ] ) contain all relevant dynamics for @xmath59 .",
    "let us set @xmath60 for the quantum field in @xmath61 and require that the classical field obeys the equation of motion .",
    "note that the quantum perturbation @xmath62 does not obey this equation of motion .",

    "for the anomalous trace we can either take the exact expression ( [ traceanomaly4 ] ) containing higher derivatives of the hubble parameter or its truncated version ( [ traceanomaly4b ] ) . likewise , for the quantum density we can either insert the full expression ( [ quantumdensity3 ] ) or the truncated one ( [ quantumdensity4 ] )",
    "the reason for truncating the expression for the quantum trace and density as outlined above is the realisation that higher derivative contributions in an equation of motion generally have the tendency to destabilise a system .    in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , one only has considered an empty universe with a cosmological term and trace anomaly . in reality ,",

    "<S> it has been argued that the quantum ( conformal ) trace anomaly could potentially provide us with a dynamical explanation of the cosmological constant problem . in this paper , however , we show by means of a semiclassical analysis that the trace anomaly does not affect the cosmological constant . we construct the effective action of the conformal anomaly for flat flrw spacetimes consisting of local quadratic geometric curvature invariants . </S>",
    "<S> counterterms are thus expected to influence the numerical value of the coefficients in the trace anomaly and we must therefore allow these parameters to vary . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the evolution of the hubble parameter in quasi de sitter spacetime , where we restrict our hubble parameter to vary slowly in time , and in flrw spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> we show dynamically that a universe consisting of matter with a constant equation of state , a cosmological constant and the quantum trace anomaly evolves either to the classical de sitter attractor or to a quantum trace anomaly driven one . </S>",
    "<S> when considering the trace anomaly truncated to quasi de sitter spacetime , we find a region in parameter space where the quantum attractor destabilises . </S>",
    "<S> when considering the exact expression of the trace anomaly , a stability analysis shows that whenever the trace anomaly driven attractor is stable , the classical de sitter attractor is unstable , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> semiclassically , the trace anomaly does not affect the classical late time de sitter attractor and hence it does not solve the cosmological constant problem . </S>"
