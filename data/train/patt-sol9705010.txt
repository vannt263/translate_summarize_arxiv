    "off - equilibrium systems composed of regions with different phases can exhibit a variety of patterns , such as fingers aligned in a certain direction .",
    "a familiar example is spinodal decomposition of binary mixtures ( for a review see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "when quenched below its critical temperature an initially homogeneous system develops domains of the new equilibrium phases . after some time",
    "these domains are well defined , i.e. they are separated by sharp interfaces .",
    "the system further approaches equilibrium by means of the motion of these interfaces , the initial pattern evolves in the course of time .",
    "another example is the dynamics of driven diffusive systems ( for a review see ref .",
    "interacting particles undergoing biased diffusion tend to form clusters under certain conditions .",
    "like for the first example there are well defined interfaces , which undergo some dynamics . in all of these phase segregating systems patterns",
    "are selected according to their stability .",
    "for example the instability of a flat interface causes the growth of fingers out of an initially flat interface . for",
    "this reason one would like to understand the stability properties of nonequilibrium interfaces .    on a course grained level these phase segregating systems are described by means of an order parameter , such as a particle density .",
    "typically , the dynamics of this order parameter can be modeled by means of some nonlinear differential equation .",
    "one of the simplest such equation is the cahn - hilliard equation ( ch equation ) , which was introduced in the context of binary mixtures @xcite .",
    "the properties of this equation are rather well understood .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of the domain boundaries obey a set of linear differential equations , which have been derived by pego @xcite using of a matched asymptotic expansion .",
    "an instability of the mullins - sekerka type has been observed .",
    "certain modification of the ch - equation were introduced to take into account the effect of external fields @xcite-@xcite , @xcite ( see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite for modified ch equations in the context of driven diffusive systems ) .",
    "one of the questions one would like to answer is the following : how does an external field change the stability properties of a flat interface ?",
    "this question was addressed by yeung et .",
    "@xcite for a certain type of driving term .",
    "this driving term has the form of an additional current which is proportional to the field and a conductivity .",
    "the conductivity was assumed to be a concave second order function of the order parameter with the same symmetry as the chemical potential .",
    "@xcite found that the field modifies the interface dynamics .",
    "an interface perpendicular to the external field is stable for one direction of the field and unstable for the other direction .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the work of yeung et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "we assume a more general structure of the driving term , i.e. a more general conductivity .",
    "our approach is the same as the one from ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . assuming that the driving field is sufficiently small we perform a matched asymptotic expansion of a modified cahn - hilliard equation with an arbitrary conductivity .",
    "the resulting set of linear equations describes the motion of an interface between coexisting phases . with the help of these equation",
    "we analyze the stability of a flat interface .",
    "we find a general stability criterion , which takes a very simple form if we assume that the conductivity is a third order polynomial in the order parameter .",
    "for such a conductivity we show that an interface perpendicular to the external field can be unstable for either direction of the field , and that an interface parallel to the external field is always stable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we define the model .",
    "a matched asymptotic expansion is done in section 3 .",
    "equations for the motion of an interface are derived . in section 4",
    "we perform a linear stability analysis for a flat interface resulting in a condition for the stability of such an interface .",
    "this condition is subsequently shown to take a simple form for the case of a conductivity that is a third order polynomial in the order parameter .",
    "section 5 summarizes the results .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional system described by a conserved order parameter @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes a position in space and @xmath2 the time . the dynamic is assumed to be defined by the following modified cahn - hilliard equation @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite : @xmath3 in the above equations",

    "the current has two additive contributions : one that minimizes the free energy and another one defining the transport caused by the field .",

    "( [ mu ] ) defines a chemical potential such that the free energy has minima in regions with @xmath14 or with @xmath15 .",

    "the current caused by the field is @xmath18 , it depends on the function @xmath19 .",

    "simultaneously we add a constant term to the conductivity and apply a galilean transformation such that the new current vanishes at both minima of the chemical potential .",

    "the transition layer between the different regions , which is seen as a line on a large enough scale , evolves during time .",
