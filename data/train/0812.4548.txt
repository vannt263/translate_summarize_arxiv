    "barrier and barrier - type options are among the most widely and frequently traded exotic options , especially in the area of foreign exchange , which makes their valuation an important topic .",
    "for example , a double barrier option is cancelled depending on whether or not two levels have been crossed before maturity .",
    "since the pay - off of a barrier option depends on the entire path of the underlying , it is clear that its valuation is more involved than that of a standard european type option .",
    "a well - documented empirical observation is that financial returns data typically possess features such as asymmetry , heavy tails and excess kurtosis , which can not be captured by the classical geometric brownian motion model ( gbm ) .",
    "related is the well known fact that under the gbm model it is not possible to calibrate option prices to the volatility surface .",
    "one of the successful modifications that has been proposed is to introduce jumps in the evolution and work with lvy models .",
    "popular examples of such lvy models are vg , cgmy , nig , gh and kobol .",
    "this approach is classical by now and we refer to the standard references @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for further financial motivations for the use of jump models , background and references . in a separate development ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) it was noted that commodity prices often display features such as mean - reversion and jumps that are clearly not captured by the geometric brownian motion model , and it was proposed to employ jump - diffusion models to incorporate those effects .",
    "the valuation of barrier options has attracted a good deal of attention and there exists currently a body of literature dealing with different aspects of pricing barrier options . in particular , for double barrier options , @xcite and @xcite developed a laplace transform approach in the geometric brownian motion setting .",
    "@xcite derived semi - analytical expressions in a jump - diffusion setting with exponential jumps , also using a transform approach . @xcite considered double no touches in a setting with exponential jumps , allowing the process dynamics to change after a barrier is breached .",
    "@xcite used eigenfunction expansions to price double barrier options in a cev setting .",
    "the mentioned papers exploit specific features of the model under consideration and can therefore not be readily generalized and applied to a different settings . a general approach , based on a characterization of the moments of the underlying process ,",
    "was followed by @xcite to price a class of exotic options . in a diffusion setting @xcite",
    "derived upper and lower bounds for the price of exotic options in terms of semidefinite programs , and provided theoretical and numerical convergence results for these bounds . before that , using linear programming , @xcite developed a method of moments algorithm to calculate first exit time probabilities and moments of a diffusion .    in this paper",
    "we will follow a method of moments approach to price double barrier options in a general setting of a polynomial - type jump - diffusion",
    ". we will also allow the rate of discounting , which is typically taken to be constant , to be a function of time and underlying .",
    "we will now briefly describe the method of moments approach .",
    "the first step is to express the option price as an integral with respect to two measures , the ( discounted ) expected exit measure and the ( discounted ) expected occupation measure .",
    "the former describes the law of the underlying at expiration or at crossing the barrier , while the latter described the law of the process until this moment . restricting ourselves to pay - offs that are piecewise polynomial functions of the underlying",
    ", the value can then be expressed as a linear combination of moments of these two measures . the moments of those two measures are subsequently shown to satisfy an infinite dimensional linear system .",
    "to the price can thus be associated the two linear programming problems of minimization and maximization of the latter criterion over the spaces of measures . by adding conditions on the moments that guarantee that a given sequence is equal to the moments of a measure , one",
    "is led to an infinite dimensional linear programming problem or a semi - definite programming problem . by restricting to a finite number of moments we arrive at a finite dimensional linear programming problem or a semi - definite programming problem .",
    "we will numerically illustrate this method for a american corridor and double no touch and double knock - out option under different models , by solving linear programming problems . in all cases",
    "we find tight bounds , with short execution times .",
    "we also provide a convergence proof to show that the values of the linear programming problems converge monotonically to the value of the option if the number of moments employed is increased .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : prob ] we specify the model and the problem setting .",
    "section [ sec : mm ] is devoted to the method of moments , describes the algorithm and provides a convergence proof .",
    "section [ sec : numerics ] provides the implementation and numerical examples .",
    "proofs are deferred to the appendix .",

    "since the number of equations grows with @xmath125 , it follows that @xmath182 is monotone increasing , since the minimum taken over a smaller set of elements is larger .",
    "note that @xmath15 is a finite linear combination of moments .",
    "because of the fact that the support of the different measures is compact , if follows that each moment is bounded , so that @xmath15 is bounded and @xmath182 is the minimization of a linear function over a bounded set",
    ". thus , the minimum @xmath182 is finite and attained at a vector @xmath183 that satisfies the corresponding linear system of equations .",
    "thus , for each fixed @xmath184 there exists a @xmath185 such that , for @xmath125 along a subsequence , @xmath186 .",
    "in fact , by a diagonal argument it follows that there exists a subsequence @xmath187 such that , as @xmath188 , @xmath189 clearly , @xmath190 satisfies the infinite system and thus under the assumption that there exists a unique sequence that solves the infinite system , it follows that @xmath190 must be equal to @xmath191 .",
    "moreover , @xmath49 and @xmath48 are the unique measures corresponding to these moments , as they are both moment - determinate .",
    "thus , @xmath192 and @xmath193    the proof of the convergence of the sequence @xmath194 is similar and omitted .",
