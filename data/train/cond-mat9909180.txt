    "this paper is the third one in a series devoted to the application of the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza ) to classical spin systems with quenched disorder .",
    "the scoza has been formulated some time ago as a theory for simple fluid and lattice - gas systems @xcite .",
    "it is based on an ornstein - zernike ( oz ) approximation for the direct correlation function @xmath0 that , by construction , enforces consistency between the different routes that give the thermodynamic potentials in terms of the pair correlation functions . in the language of magnetic systems",
    ", this means that the same gibbs free energy @xmath1 is obtained whether one integrates the susceptibility @xmath2 with respect to the magnetization @xmath3 or the internal energy @xmath4 with respect to the inverse temperature @xmath5 . in the case of the spin",
    "@xmath6 ising model with ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interactions , this self - consistency requirement is embodied in a diffusive - like partial differential equation with @xmath3 and @xmath7 as independent variables .",
    "this equation could be solved only recently for the various three - dimensional lattices @xcite , showing that the scoza predicts all thermodynamic and structural properties with great accuracy , even in the close vicinity of the critical point @xcite .",
    "as the spatial dimension @xmath8 goes to infinity , the scoza becomes exact and identifies with mean - field theory .",
    "this approach can thus be viewed as an approximate but non - perturbative way of taking into account thermal fluctuations in finite dimensions . although this is an oz theory which does not handle correctly long - range critical fluctuations , the asymptotic critical exponents are non - classical . for the 3-d ising model",
    ", they have the spherical - model values in a very narrow region above the critical temperature , but are much accurate along the magnetization curve ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .    in the preceding papers of this series @xcite",
    ", we used the replica method to generalize this approach to disordered spin systems .",
    "this allowed us to obtain an accurate description of the dependence of the critical temperature on dilution in the 3-d site - diluted ising model @xcite and to study the influence of the random - field distribution on the phase diagram of the random - field ising model ( rfim ) for @xmath10 @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "possible replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) effects were ignored . in this work ,",
    "we present a first application of the scoza to the edwards - anderson ( ea ) ising spin glass model @xcite whose low - temperature properties remain a subject of controversies after nearly twenty - five years of intense activity . whereas parisi s mean - field theory @xcite is generally accepted as the exact solution of the infinite - ranged sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite",
    ", there is yet no consensus on whether or not the rsb scenario associated with the appearance of multiple equilibrium states at low temperature survives in realistic , short - ranged , finite - dimensional models ( for recent reviews of this problem , see @xcite ) .",
    "a relevant open question is the existence of a phase transition in presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "whereas the scaling approach based on the droplet model @xcite predicts that a non - zero magnetic field destroys the spin glass phase , the mean - field picture suggests that there is still an almeida - thouless ( at ) line @xcite separating the spin glass phase from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "although the scoza is based on a simple oz ansatz for the correlation functions ( so that the critical exponent @xmath11 is zero , a rather crude approximation for the 3-d ea model according to numerical simulations @xcite ) , it may be sufficiently accurate to give useful indications about the stability of the high temperature phase against rsb fluctuations .",
    "it is worth stressing that the scoza becomes exact when @xmath12 , so that one recovers in this limit the behavior of the sk model .",
    "our purpose is thus to use this non - perturbative approach to generalize the at analysis to finite dimensions , i.e. to determine the locus of singularities of the spin glass susceptibility @xmath13 working from the replica - symmetric region .",
    "this amounts to study the eigenvalues of the wave - vector - dependent inverse susceptibility matrix at @xmath14 .",
    "as the inverse susceptibility matrix is just the matrix of direct correlation functions generated by a legendre transformed gibbs free energy , our program is the following : derive the appropriate oz equations , assume an oz form for the direct correlation functions ( which means , in the present case , truncate them at nearest - neighbor separation ) , invert the oz equations , and use all existing self - consistency requirements and exact relations ( for instance , the values of the pair distribution functions at zero separation ) to derive a set of partial differential equations whose solution will provide the phase boundaries in zero field and the at lines .",
    "( note that the scoza can also be combined with the parisi rsb scheme ; the main obstacle is the tractability of the calculation that requires inverting ultrametric matrices as done in ref . @xcite",
    "this program , however , is not fully completed in the present paper which is only devoted to the calculation of the freezing temperature @xmath15 and of the thermodynamic properties at and above @xmath15 as a function of dimensionality .",
    "the stability analysis , which requires a more difficult numerical computation , will be presented later .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we introduce the model and we perform the double legendre transform that allows one to introduce the direct correlation functions . the oz equations in replica space are then solved in the case of replica symmetry . in section 3 , we define an oz approximation for the direct correlation functions which , at the lowest level , coincides with standard mean field theory .",
    "we also derive the exact core conditions and self - consistency relations . in section 4 , this formalism is used to derive the scoza equations in the case of zero field .",
    "numerical results are presented in section 5 .",
    "we consider an ea spin - glass hamiltonian for @xmath16 spins @xmath17 on a d - dimensional hypercubic lattice = - _ < ij > j_ij _",

    "it is also useful to introduce a fictitious field @xmath27 which couples to the quantity @xmath28 . when @xmath29 , @xmath30 can be interpreted as the variance of a gaussian random field but , in the present work , we are mainly interested in the limit @xmath31 ( see ref .",

    "at the end , we shall take the limit @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "it is likely that the small deviations for @xmath224 and 7 come from the fact that only @xmath225 is nonzero in the simplified oz approximation , eq .",
    "indeed , the exact calculation of @xmath226 and @xmath227 to order @xmath218 shows that the three functions do extend to nearest - neighbor separation @xcite .",
    "but the introduction of @xmath228 and @xmath229 would require self - consistency relations involving the three direct correlation functions separately .",
    "this is only possible if one breaks replica symmetry in some way . below the upper critical dimension @xmath230 ,",
    "the fact that @xmath11 is no longer zero comes also into play and may explain the more significant deviations from the simulation results , especially for @xmath220 ( @xmath231 according to ref .",

    "1 . note the broad maximum that appears above the freezing temperature for @xmath220 , in agreement with experimental and simulation data @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the mean - field behavior that predicts a cusp at @xmath15 .    in summary ,",
    "the scoza results for the properties of the ea model at and above the freezing temperature as a function of dimensionality are in reasonable agreement with the known estimates .",
    "this represents an encouraging step for proceeding further in studying the stability of the replica - symmetric solution at temperatures below @xmath15 .",
