    "<S> the continuum emission at 1.3@xmath0 mm and 0.85@xmath0 mm and the h30@xmath1 and h26@xmath1 lines were observed with the submillimeter array ( sma ) at angular resolutions of @xmath20.5@xmath3 - 3@xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> its continuum power spectrum at millimeter wavelengths is almost flat ( @xmath1=-0.16 , with @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 ) , indicating that this source is dominated by optically thin free - free emission . </S>",
    "<S> the h30@xmath1 and h26@xmath1 rrl emission is also compact and peaks toward the position of the monr2-irs2 source . </S>",
    "<S> the measured rrl profiles are double - peaked with the h26@xmath1 line showing a clear asymmetry in its spectrum . since the derived line - to - continuum flux ratios ( @xmath280 and 180@xmath0km@xmath0s@xmath8 for h30@xmath1 and h26@xmath1 , respectively ) exceed the lte predictions , the rrls toward monr2-irs2 are affected by maser amplification . </S>",
    "<S> the amplification factors are however smaller than those found toward the emission line star mwc349a , indicating that monr2-irs2 is a weakly amplified maser . </S>",
    "<S> radiative transfer modelling of the rrl emission toward this source shows that the rrl masers arise from a dense and collimated jet embedded in a cylindrical ionized wind , oriented nearly along the direction of the line - of - sight . </S>",
    "<S> high - angular resolution observations at sub - millimeter wavelengths are needed to unveil weakly amplified rrl masers in very young massive stars . </S>"
