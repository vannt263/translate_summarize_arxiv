    "with qcd in our hands as the theory for the strong interaction , the running of the strong coupling constant can be computed by the perturbation theory in the uv domain , supplemented by nonperturbative ope corrections when the ir domain is approached .",
    "thus , values of the strong coupling constant obtained from experimental data at many different scales can be confronted to each others and to the theoretical running .",
    "this successful confrontation is a benchmark calculation of qcd . when integrated , the renormalization group equation which governs the running of the coupling constant introduces an energy scale , @xmath1 , as a boundary condition .",
    "@xmath1 is defined for a given number of active quark species and can be only obtained as an input from experiment .",
    "lattice computations can be used for the purpose of deriving @xmath1 from an experimental input .",
    "the usual procedure can be shortly described as follows .",
    "any quantity extracted from a lattice simulation is obtained in unit of the lattice spacing , @xmath2 .",
    "this scale depends on the bare coupling and others bare set - up parameters used in the simulation .",
    "its value in physical unit is fixed by confronting a low - energy experimental number ( a mass , a decay constant , @xmath3 ) with its lattice prediction .",
    "once the lattice spacing is known , the coupling at a given momentum can be computed from the lattice .",
    "then , @xmath1 can be subsequently derived from that coupling value . among the methods",
    "most extensively applied to measure a coupling , one could find the implemention of the schrdinger functional scheme ( see , for instance ,  @xcite and references therein ) , those based on the perturbative analysis of short - distance sensitive lattice observables as the inter - quark static potential ( see for instance  @xcite ) , the `` boosted '' lattice coupling ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , moments of charmonia two - point correlation functions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) or , in particular , those based on the study of the momentum behaviour of green functions ( see  @xcite , for instance ) .    very recently , in refs .",
    "@xcite , we reported on our preliminary studies of the strong coupling running and evaluation of @xmath1 with lattice simulations including up , down , strange and charm dynamical quarks in the sea .",
    "these two were the last of a series of works ( see also @xcite ) aimed at computing the strong coupling through the lattice determination of the ghost - gluon coupling in the so - called mom taylor renormalization scheme . a similar program developed in parallel by different authors  @xcite , although following a different approach for the data analysis , is also in progress .",
    "the current paper is entirely devoted to complete this series of papers with upgraded results obtained by performing an improved analysis .",
    "the main _ ace _ for the improvement is the use of a new high - statistics sample of gauge configurations which reduces the statistical errors and allows for a better control of systematic uncertainties . in particular , we relax assumptions previously made for the @xmath4-invariant lattice artefacts which can be fitted from the data .",
    "such an improved analysis confirms first that nonperturbative power corrections are required for the running description of the data within our available momentum window .",
    "these power corrections , at the leading order , appear to behave as predicted by svz sum - rules  @xcite .",
    "then , we finally provide with a lattice estimate for @xmath1 in good agreement with the current  _ world average _ \" given by particle data group  @xcite .",
    "updating the determination of the strong running coupling from the ghost - gluon vertex in the mom taylor scheme reported in @xcite is the main goal of this work .",
    "the details of the procedure , that will be hereupon outlined , have been profusely described in many previous works  @xcite .",
    "the keystone for an accurate determination of @xmath6 from the ghost - gluon coupling in the mom taylor scheme is the well - known taylor s statement about the non - renormalization of the ghost - gluon vertex with vanishing incoming ghost momentum in landau gauge  @xcite .",
    "this implies that one can define a particular scheme for the qcd coupling such that its running with the renormalization momenta only relies on two - point green functions renormalization constants  @xcite , [ alpha ] _",
    "t(^2 ) =  _ z_3(^2,^2 ) _ 3 ^ 2(^2,^2 )  , where @xmath7/@xmath8 stand for the gluon / ghost propagator renormalization constant and @xmath9 is a non specified uv cut - off .",
    "the main advantage resulting from this definition is that a very accurate nonperturbative estimate of the coupling and a very precise knowledge for its running from continuum perturbation tools can be both attained .",
    "it is worth to recall that an effective qcd charge definition , related to the pinching - technique effective charge  @xcite and useful for phenomenological purposes  @xcite , can be grounded on this coupling in mom taylor scheme  @xcite .",
    "being regularization independent , we will use lattice - regularized ghost and gluon propagators to estimate @xmath10 , provided that the lattice artefacts are properly kept under control such that the continuum limit is well recovered .",
    "the latter will be tested by considering , as will be seen below , different lattice set - up s and verifying that s results do not depend on the uv regularization cut - off , _",
    "i.e. _ the lattice spacing .",
    "specially crucial is the very precise knowledge for the running of @xmath10 with momenta . at the four - loop level , from continuum perturbation theory , and with an operator product expansion ( ope ) at the leading power correction",

    "the latter is mainly because , in order to be left with stable fits , we did not need to combine data from simulations at different @xmath19 and made no hypothesis on how the lattice artefacts scale for different lattice spacings .",
    "the strong coupling renormalized in the mom taylor scheme has been obtained from ghost and gluon propagators that have been in their turn computed from several high - statistical samples of gauge field configurations , simulated at two different bare couplings , @xmath19 s , and four different sets of masses for the degenerate up and down and non - degenerate strange and charm twisted - mass dynamical quark flavors .",
    "we thus updated our previous results by performing a significatively improved analysis , which reduced the statistical errors and allowed for a better control of the systematic uncertainties , as those related with higher - order ope corrections and lattice artefacts .",

    "last but not least , we avoided to assume the constancy of the coefficient @xmath33 for the @xmath4-invariant lattice artefacts and indeed found it to happen consistently with the approximation of neglecting higher - order artefacts .    as a result of our improved analysis , we confirmed the need to include nonperturbative corrections in order to describe the lattice data for the mom taylor strong coupling for momenta below 7 gev . after dealing properly with lattice artefacts ,",
    "the wilson coefficient for the leading ope power correction , known at the @xmath16-order , is found to account for data with momenta roughly above 4 gev and , along with an effective higher - order power correction , above @xmath48 gev .",
    "the value of @xmath22 , for @xmath49=4 , has been obtained from the running of the taylor strong coupling and used then to estimate the @xmath15 coupling at the @xmath38-mass scale and , properly handling the transition from @xmath49=4 to @xmath49=5 , at the @xmath42-mass scale . in both cases ,",
    "our estimates agree with the  _ world average _ \" results the particle data group provides .",
    "therefore , with the lattice - regularized qcd action we used , the pion mass and decay constant have been taken as the physical scales to size the strong coupling in the appropriate momentum window , roughly from 2 to 7 gev .",
    "as far as perturbative qcd is , in its turn , applied to run the coupling from those momenta up to @xmath42-mass scale , a main conclusion of this work is that _ qcd is successfully bridging from the low - momentum pion sector up to the very uv domain for the strong interactions_.",
