    "clearly @xmath8 is symmetric in the three masses .",
    "however , when one eliminates one of the mandelstam variables ( or any linear combination ) one is left , for even @xmath1 , with an elliptic integral which is not _",
    "explicitly _ symmetrical , although it must be so implicitly .",
    "the aim of this article is to exhibit three routes for getting a satisfyingly symmetrical result in the @xmath9 case , where @xmath8 is nothing but the area of the dalitz - kibble plot  @xcite divided by @xmath10 .",
    "detailed derivations are not given , for lack of space , but will be published elsewhere .",
    "the complicated expressions found by almgren  @xcite and bauberger et al  @xcite , obtained by finally integrating [ @xmath11 , @xmath12 below ] @xmath13 involve the complete elliptic integrals , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 the main point is that the result is symmetric under @xmath18 interchange but _ not obviously so _ under @xmath19 and @xmath20 interchanges .",
    "the key to converting these expressions into symmetric form is to pass to the jacobian zeta - functions @xmath21 via @xmath22 with @xmath23 and to use the addition formula ( 142.01 ) of byrd and friedman  @xcite : @xmath24 after numerous manoeuvres , including identification of the three angles @xmath25 \\ ; , \\ ] ] etc . and noting the remarkable connection @xmath26 one obtains the beautifully symmetric form : @xmath27 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{21 mm } + \\sqrt{q_{++ } q_{-- } } \\ ; k(k )   \\biggl [ \\frac{z(\\varphi_1,k)}{\\sin^2\\varphi_1 } + \\frac{z(\\varphi_2,k)}{\\sin^2\\varphi_2 } + \\frac{z(\\varphi_3,k)}{\\sin^2\\varphi_3 } \\biggl ] \\biggl\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in the triangular phase plot , pictured in figure  1 , points @xmath28 refer to configurations where the mandelstam variables assume their minimum values , points @xmath29 where they attain their maximum values and the @xmath30-lines and @xmath31-lines are tangents at @xmath29 and @xmath28 .    needing to integrate within the cubic outline @xmath32 , one",

    "these crescents are readily evaluated in the limit of large @xmath37 and of small @xmath38 by analytical means .",
