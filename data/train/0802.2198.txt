    "quantum field theory has been formulated in different ways , the most popular ones being the path - integral approach and the operator formalism . in the path integral",
    "approach , one aims to construct the correlation functions of the theory as the moments of some measure on the space of classical field configurations . in the operator formalism",
    ", the quantum fields are viewed as linear operators which can act on physical states .",
    "the path integral has the advantage of being closely related to classical field theory .",
    "in fact , the path integral measure is , at least formally , directly given in terms of the classical action of the theory .",
    "the operator formalism is more useful in contexts where no corresponding classical theory  and hence no lagrange formalism  is known for the quantum field theory .",
    "it has been used extensively in the context of conformal or integrable field theories in two spacetime dimensions . in the operator formalism",
    ", one may take the point of view that the theory is determined by the algebraic relations between the quantum field observables .",
    "this viewpoint was originally proposed in a very abstract form by haag and kastler , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "other proposals aimed in particular at conformal field theories include e.g. the approach via vertex operator algebras due to borcherds , frenkel , lopowski , meurman and others  @xcite , see also a related proposal by gaberdiel and goddard  @xcite .",
    "a different approach of an essentially algebraic nature applicable to `` globally conformally invariant quantum field theories '' in @xmath0 dimensions is due to  @xcite .",
    "approaches emphasizing the algebraic relations between the fields have also turned out to fundamental to the construction of quantum field theories on general curved backgrounds  @xcite , because in this case there is no preferred hilbert space representation or vacuum state .    one way to encode the algebraic relations between the fields in a very explicit way ( at least at short distances )",
    "is the wilson operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite .",
    "this expansion is at the basis of the modern treatments of two - dimensional conformal field theory , and it is a key tool in the quantitative analysis of asymptotically free quantum gauge theories in four dimensions such as quantum chromo dynamics .",
    "the ope can also be established for perturbative quantum field theory in general curved spacetimes  @xcite . in this reference , it was observed in particular that the ope coefficients satisfy certain `` asymptotic clustering '' or `` factorization '' relations when various groups of points in the operator products are scaled together at different rates .",
    "this observation was taken one step further in  @xcite , where it was suggested that the ope should in fact be viewed as the fundamental datum describing a quantum field theory on curved ( and flat ) spacetimes , and that the factorization conditions should be viewed as the essential constraints upon the ope coefficients .    in this paper",
    ", we will analyze these constraints on the ope coefficients , and thereby formulate a new approach to quantum field theory in terms of the resulting consistency conditions .",
    "one of our main new points is that all these constraints can be encoded in a single condition which is to be viewed as an analogue of the usual `` associativity condition '' in ordinary algebra .",
    "we then show that it is possible to give a new formulation of perturbation theory which directly involves the ope coefficients , but does not directly use such notions  and is more general as  path integrals or interaction lagrangians .",
    "this new approach relies on a perturbative formulation of the consistency condition and is hence essentially algebraic in nature .",
    "its mathematical framework is a certain cohomology of `` hochschild type '' which we will also set up in this paper .",
    "if our approach to perturbation theory is combined with the assumptions of certain linear or non - linear field equations , then a constructive algorithm is obtained to determine the terms in the perturbation series order - by - order .",
    "we expect that our approach is equivalent to more standard ones despite its rather different appearance , but we do not investigate this issue in the present paper",
    ".    some of our ideas bear a ( relatively remote ) resemblance to ideas that have been proposed a long time ago within the `` bootstrap - approach '' to conformally invariant quantum field theories , where constraints of a somewhat similar , but not identical , nature as ours have been considered under the name  crossing relations \"  @xcite .",
    "but we stress from the outset that our approach is aimed at all quantum field theories  including even quantum field theories on generic spacetime manifolds without symmetries  and not just conformal ones as in these references .",
    "the ideas on the use of non - linear field equations expressed in section  [ interactingfields ] also bear a resemblance to a constructive method in quantum field theory introduced by steinmann ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , but he is mainly concerned with the wightman functions rather than the ope , which is a key difference .",
    "some of the ideas in section  [ interactingfields ] were developed , in preliminary form , in extensive discussions with n.  nikolov during his tenure as a humboldt fellow at the u. of g \" ottingen in 2005/2006 , see also the notes  @xcite . in the present form described in section  [ interactingfields ] , these ideas were developed in collaboration with h.  olbermann , and more details will be given in a future paper  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first explain in sec .",
    "2 the basic ideas of this paper , namely , the idea of that the factorization conditions may be expressed by a single associativity condition , the new formulation of perturbation theory in our framework , the generalization to gauge field theories , and the approach via field equations .",
    "these ideas are then explained in detail in the subsequent sections .",
    "the operator product expansion states that the product of two operators may be expanded as [ basic ] _",
    "b(x_2 ) = _ c c_ab^c(x_1 , x_2 ) _",
    "c(x_2 ) , where @xmath1 are labels of the various composite quantum fields @xmath2 in the theory .",
    "this relation is intended to be valid after taking expectation values in any ( reasonable ) state in the quantum field theory .",
    "the states , as well as the ope coefficients typically have certain analytic continuation properties that arise from the spectrum condition in the quantum field theory .",
    "these properties imply that the spacetime arguments may be continued to a real euclidean section of complexified minkowski spacetime , and we assume this has been done .",
    "an important condition on the ope coefficients arises when one considers the operator product expansion of @xmath3 operators ( in the euclidean domain ) , [ 3ops ] _ a ( x_1 ) _",
    "c(x_3 ) = _ d c_abc^d(x_1 , x_2 , x_3 ) _",
    "d(x_3 ) . let us consider a situation where one pair of points is closer to each other than another pair of points .",
    "for example , let @xmath4 be smaller than @xmath5 , where r_ij = |x_i - x_j| is the euclidean distance between point @xmath6 and point @xmath7",
    ". then we expect that we can first expand the operator product @xmath8 in eq",
    ".   around @xmath9 , then multiply by @xmath10 , and finally expand the resulting product around @xmath9 . we thereby expect to obtain the relation [ 2ops1 ] c_abc^d(x_1 , x_2 , x_3 ) = _ e c_bc^e(x_2 , x_3 )",
    "c_ae^d(x_1 , x_3 ) similarly , if @xmath11 is smaller than @xmath4 , we expect that we can first expand the operator product @xmath12 around @xmath13 , then multiply the result by @xmath14 , and finally expand again around @xmath9 . in this way",
    ", we expect to obtain the relation [ 2ops2 ] c_abc^d(x_1 , x_2 , x_3 ) = _ e c_ab^e(x_1 , x_2 ) c_ec^d(x_2 , x_3 ) .",
    "a consistency relation now arises because on the open domain @xmath15 both expansions  , must be valid and therefore should coincide .",
    "thus , we must have [ assoccomp ] _",
    "e c_ab^e(x_1 , x_2 ) c_e c^d(x_2 , x_3 ) = _ e c_bc^e(x_2 , x_3 ) c_a e^d(x_1 , x_3 ) when @xmath15 .",
    "this requirement imposes a very stringent condition on the ope - coefficients .",
    "we will refer to this condition as a `` consistency- '' or `` associativity '' condition .",
    "the basic idea of this paper is that this condition on the 2-point ope coefficients incorporates the full information about the structure of the quantum field theory .",
    "therefore , conversely , if a solution to the consistency condition can be found , then one has in effect constructed a quantum field theory .",
    "we will pursue this idea below in the following different directions .",
    "first , we will pursue the question whether any further consistency conditions in addition to eq .",
    "can arise when one considers products of more than three fields , by analogy with the analysis just given for three fields .",
    "for example , if we consider the ope of four fields @xmath16 and investigate the possible different subsequent expansions of such a product in a similar manner as above , we will get new relations for the 2-point ope coefficients analogous to eq .  .",
    "these will now involve four points and correspondingly more factors of the 2-point ope coefficients .",
    "are these conditions genuinely new , or do they already follow from the relation  ?",
    "as we will argue , this question is analogous to the question whether , in an ordinary algebra , there are new constraints on the product coming from `` higher order associativity conditions '' . as in this analogous situation",
    ", we will see that in fact no new conditions arise , i.e. the associativity condition   is the only consistency condition .",
    "we will also see that all higher order expansion coefficients such as @xmath17 are uniquely determined by the 2-point ope coefficients .",
    "thus , in this sense , the entire information about the quantum field theory is contained in these 2-point coefficients @xmath18 , and the entire set of consistency conditions is coherently encoded in the associativity condition  .",
    "for this reason , we call the result a `` coherence theorem '' , by analogy with the well - known similar result in algebra and in category theory  @xcite .",
    "these results are described in detail in sec .",
    "[ coherence ] .      given that the 2-point ope coefficients @xmath18 are considered in as the fundamental entities in quantum field theory in our approach , it is interesting to ask how to formulate perturbation theory in terms of these coefficients . for this",
    ", we imagine that we are given a 1-parameter family of these coefficients parametrized by @xmath19 . for each @xmath19",
    ", the coefficients should satisfy the associativity condition  , and for @xmath20 , the coefficients describe the quantum field theory that we wish to perturb around .",
    "we now expand the 1-parameter family of ope - coefficients in a taylor- or perturbation series in @xmath19 , and we ask what constraints the consistency condition will impose upon the taylor coefficients . in order to have a reasonably uncluttered notation ,",
    "let us use an `` index free '' notation for the ope - coefficients suppressing the indices @xmath21 .",
    "thus , let us view the 2-point ope coefficients @xmath18 as the components of a linear map @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the vector space whose basis elements are in one - to - one correspondence with the composite fields @xmath24 of the theory .",
    "the taylor expansion is [ cexpansioncomp ] ( x_1 , x_2 ; ) = _ i=0^_i(x_1 , x_2 ) ^i .",
    "we similarly expand the associativity condition as a power series in @xmath19 .",
    "if we assume that the associativity condition is fulfilled at zeroth order , then the corresponding condition for the first order perturbation of the 2-point ope - coefficients is given by [ firstocons ] & & _ 0(x_2 , x_3)(_1(x_1 , x_2 ) i d ) - _ 0(x_1 , x_3 ) ( id_1(x_2 , x_3 ) ) + + & & _ 1(x_2 , x_3)(_0(x_1 , x_2 ) i",
    "d ) - _ 1(x_1 , x_3 ) ( id_0(x_2 , x_3 ) ) = 0 , for @xmath15 , in an obvious tensor product notation . as we will see",
    ", this condition is of a cohomological nature , and the set of all first order perturbations satisfying this condition modulo trivial perturbations due to field redefinitions can be identified with the elements of a certain cohomology ring which we will define in close analogy to hochschild cohomology  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the conditions for the higher order perturbations can also be described in terms of this cohomology ring .",
    "more precisely , at each order there is a potential obstruction to continue the perturbation series  i.e .",
    ", to satisfy the associativity condition at that order  and this obstruction is again an element of our cohomology ring .    in practice",
    ", @xmath19 can be e.g. a parameter that measures the strength of the self interaction of a theory , as in the theory characterized by the classical lagrangian @xmath25 .",
    "in this example , one is perturbing around a free field theory , for which the ope - coefficients are known completely .",
    "another example is when one perturbs around a more general conformal field theory  not necessarily described by a lagrangian .",
    "yet another example is when @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of `` colors '' of a theory , like in @xmath28  yang - mills theory . in this example",
    ", the theory that one is perturbing around is the large-@xmath27-limit of the theory .",
    "these constructions are described in detail in sec .",
    "[ perturbations ] .      some modifications must be applied to our constructions when one is dealing with theories having local gauge invariance , such as yang - mills theories .",
    "when dealing with such theories , one typically has to proceed in two steps .",
    "the first step is to introduce an auxiliary theory including further fields .",
    "for example , in pure yang - mills theory , the auxiliary theory has as basic fields the 1-form gauge potential @xmath29 , a pair of anti - commuting `` ghost fields '' @xmath30 , as well as another auxiliary field @xmath31 , all of which take values in a lie - algebra .",
    "having constructed the auxiliary theory , one then removes the additional degrees of freedom in a second step , thereby arriving at the actual quantum field theory one is interested in .",
    "the necessity of such a two - step procedure can be seen from many viewpoints , maybe most directly in the path - integral formulation of qft  @xcite , but also actually even from the point of view of classical hamiltonian field theory , see e.g.  @xcite .    as is well - known , a particularly elegant and useful way to implement this two - step procedure is via the so - called brst - formalism  @xcite , and this is also the most useful way to proceed in our approach to quantum field theory via the ope . in this approach",
    "one defines , on the space of auxiliary fields , a linear map @xmath32 ( `` brst - transformation '' ) .",
    "the crucial properties of this map are that it is a symmetry of the auxiliary theory , and that it is nilpotent , @xmath33 . in the case of yang - mills theory",
    "it is given by [ brstt ] sa = du - i , su = -[u , u ] , s|u = f , sf=0 , on the basic fields and extended to all monomials in the basic fields and their derivatives ( `` composite fields '' ) in such a way that @xmath33 . in our formalism , the key property of the auxiliary theory is now that the map @xmath32 be compatible with the ope of the auxiliary theory .",
    "the condition that we need is that , for any product of composite fields , we have s[_a(x_1 ) _",
    "b(x_2 ) ] = [ s _ a(x_1 ) ] _ b(x_2 ) _",
    "a(x_1 ) s_b(x_2 ) , where the choice of @xmath34 depends on the bose / fermi character of the fields under consideration .",
    "if we apply the ope to the products in this equation , then it translates into a compatibility condition between the ope coefficients @xmath35 and the map @xmath32 .",
    "this is the key condition on the auxiliary theory beyond the associativity condition  .",
    "as we show , it enables one to pass from the auxiliary quantum field theory to true gauge theory by taking a certain quotient of the space of fields .",
    "we will also perform a perturbation analysis of gauge theories . here",
    ", one needs not only to expand the ope - coefficients [ see eq .  ] , but also the brst - transformation map @xmath36 , as perturbations will typically change the form of the brst transformations as well  seen explicitly for yang - mills theory in eqs .  .",
    "we must now satisfy at each order in perturbation theory an associativity condition as described above , and in addition a condition which ensures compatibility of the perturbed brst map and the perturbed ope coefficients at the given order .",
    "as we will see , these conditions can again be encoded elegantly and compactly in a cohomological framework .",
    "these ideas will be explained in detail in sec .",
    "[ hochschild ] .",
    "the discussion so far has been focussed so far on the general mathematical structures behind the operator product expansion . however , it is clearly also of interest to construct the ope coefficients for concrete theories .",
    "one way to describe a theory is via classical field equations such as [ phicubed ] = ^3 , where @xmath19 is a coupling parameter .",
    "one may exploit such relations by turning them into conditions on the ope coefficients .",
    "the ope coefficients are then determined by a `` bootstrap''-type approach .",
    "the conditions implied by eq .",
    "arise as follows : we first view the above field equation as a relation between quantum fields , and we multiply by an arbitrary quantum field @xmath24 from the right : ( x_1 ) _",
    "a(x_2 ) = ^3(x_1 ) _",
    "next , we perform an ope of the expressions on both sides , leading to the relation @xmath37 . as explained above in subsection  [ subsecpert ] , each ope coefficient itself is a formal power series in @xmath19 , so this equation clearly yields a relationship between different orders in this power series . the basic idea is to exploit these relations and to derive an iterative construction scheme .    to indicate how this works , it is useful to introduce , for each field @xmath24 , a `` vertex operator '' @xmath38 , which is a linear map on the space @xmath23 of all composite fields .",
    "the matrix components of this linear map are simply given by the ope coefficients , @xmath39_b^c = c_{ab}^c(x,0)$ ] , for details see sec .  [ leftrep ] .",
    "clearly , the vertex operator contains exactly the same information as the ope coefficient . in the above theory , it is a power series @xmath40 in the coupling .",
    "the field equation then leads to the relation y_i+1(x , ) = y_i(x,^3 ) .",
    "the zeroth order @xmath41 corresponds to the free theory , described in sec .",
    "[ freefield ] , and the higher order ones are determined inductively by inverting the laplace operator . to make the scheme work , it is necessary to construct @xmath42 from @xmath43 at each order .",
    "it is at this point that we need the consistency condition . in terms of the vertex operators",
    ", it implies e.g. relations like _",
    "j=0^i y_j(x , ) y_i - j(y , ) = _",
    "j=0^i y_j(y , y_i - j(x - y , ) ) . on the right side",
    ", we now use a relation like @xmath44 .",
    "such a relation enables one to solve for @xmath45 in terms of inductively known quantities .",
    "iterating this type of argument , one also obtains @xmath46 , and in fact any other vertex operator at @xmath47-th order . in this way",
    ", the induction loop closes .",
    "thus , we obtain an inductive scheme from the field equation in combination with the consistency condition . at each order",
    ", one has to perform one  essentially trivial ",
    "inversion of the laplace operator , and several infinite sums implicit in the consistency condition .",
    "these sums arise when composing two vertex operators if these are written in terms of their matrix components .",
    "thus , to compute the ope coefficients at @xmath48-th order in perturbation theory , the `` computational cost '' is roughly to perform @xmath48 infinite sums .",
    "this is similar to the case of ordinary perturbation theory , where at @xmath48-th order one has to perform a number of feynman integrals increasing with @xmath48 .",
    "note however that , by contrast with the usual approaches to perturbation theory , our procedure is completely well - defined at each step .",
    "thus , there is no `` renormalization '' in our approach in the sense of `` infinite counterterms '' .",
    "the details of this new approach to perturbation theory are outlined in sec .",
    "[ interactingfields ] , and presented in more detail in a forthcoming paper with h. olbermann .",
    "having stated the basic ideas in this paper in an informal way , we now turn to the precise formulation of these ideas . for this , we begin in this section by explaining our axiomatic setup for quantum field theory . the setup we present here is broadly speaking the same as that presented in  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the key idea here as well as in  @xcite is that the operator product expansion ( ope ) should be regarded as the defining property of a quantum field theory .",
    "however , there are some differences to  @xcite in that we work on flat space here ( as opposed to a general curved spacetime ) , and we also work in a euclidean framework . as a consequence , the microlocal conditions stated in  @xcite will be replaced by analyticity conditions , the commutativity condition will be replaced by a symmetry condition and the associativity conditions on the ope coefficients will be replaced by conditions on the existence of various power series expansions .",
    "the first ingredient in our definition of a quantum field theory is an infinite - dimensional vector space , @xmath23 .",
    "the elements in this vector space are to be thought of as the components of the various composite scalar , spinor , and tensor fields in the theory .",
    "for example , in a theory describing a single real scalar field @xmath49 , the elements of @xmath23 would be in one - to - one correspondence with the monomials of @xmath49 and its derivatives [ see sec .",
    "[ freefield ] ] .",
    "the space @xmath23 is assumed to be graded in various ways which reflect the possibility to classify the different composite quantum fields in the theory by their spin , dimension , bose / fermi character , etc .",
    "first , for euclidean quantum field theory on @xmath50 , the space @xmath23 should carry a representation of the rotation group @xmath51 in @xmath0 dimensions respectively of its covering group @xmath52 if spinor fields are present .",
    "this representation should decompose into unitary , finite - dimensional irreducible representations ( irrep s ) @xmath53 , which in turn are characterized by the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath54 of the @xmath55 casimir operators associated with @xmath51 . for @xmath56 ,",
    "this is a weight @xmath57 , for @xmath58 this is an integer or half - integer spin , and for @xmath59 this is a pair of spins ( using the isomorphism between @xmath60 and the covering of the 4-dimensional rotation group ) .",
    "thus we assume that @xmath23 is a graded vector space [ decomp ] v = _ _ + _ s c^n ( , s ) v_s . the numbers @xmath61 provide an additional grading which will later be related to the `` dimension '' of the quantum fields .",
    "the natural number @xmath62 is the multiplicity of the quantum fields with a given dimension @xmath63 and spins @xmath64 .",
    "we assume this multiplicity to be finite .",
    "as always in this paper , the infinite sums in this decomposition are understood without any closure taken , i.e. , the elements of @xmath23 are in one - to - one correspondence with sequences of the form @xmath65 with only finitely many non - zero entries , where @xmath66 is a vector in the @xmath47-th summand in the decomposition . on the vector space @xmath23",
    ", we would like to have an anti - linear , involutive operation called @xmath67 which should be thought of as taking the hermitian adjoint of the quantum fields .",
    "we would also like to have a linear grading map @xmath68 with the property @xmath69 .",
    "the vectors corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath70 are to be thought of as `` bosonic '' , while those corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath71 are to be thought of as `` fermionic '' .",
    "so far , we have only defined a list of objects  in fact a linear space  that we think of as labeling the various composite quantum fields of the theory .",
    "the dynamical content and quantum nature of the given theory is now incorporated in the operator product coefficients associated with the quantum fields .",
    "this is a hierarchy denoted = ( ( x_1 , x_2 ) , ( x_1 , x_2 , x_3 ) , ( x_1 , x_2 , x_3 , x_4 ) ,  ) , where each @xmath72 is an analytic function on the `` configuration space '' m_n : = \\{(x_1 ,  , x_n ) ( ^d)^n x_i x_j } , taking values in the linear maps does not take its values in the space @xmath23 , because for each @xmath73 , the expression @xmath74 typically has non - zero components in an infinite number of summands in the decomposition  .",
    "by contrast , @xmath23 by definition only consists of vectors which have non - zero components only for finitely many summands .",

    "an elementary result for algebras is that there do not arise any further constraints on the product @xmath178 from `` higher associativity conditions '' such as for example [ ahigherass ] ( ab)(cd ) = ( a(bc))d indeed , it is not difficult to prove this identity by successively applying eq .  , and this can be generalized to prove all possible higher associativity identities .",
    "the associativity condition   is analogous to the consistency conditions for the ope coefficients arising from the the factorization constraint   for three points .",
    "moreover , the higher order associativity conditions   are analogous to the conditions that arise from the factorization constraint for more than three points .",
    "thus , our coherence theorem is analogous to the above statement for ordinary algebras that there are no higher order associativity constraints which are not already automatically satisfied on account of the standard associativity condition  .",
    "let us now describe our coherence result in more detail . for @xmath175 points , there are three partitions of the set @xmath181 leading to three corresponding non - trivial factorization conditions  , namely @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 .",
    "the corresponding domains on which the factorization identities are valid are given respectively by [ threet ] d[_1 ] & = & \\{(x_1 , x_2 , x_3 ) r_23 < r_13 } , + d[_2 ] & = & \\{(x_1 , x_2 , x_3 ) r_13 < r_23 } , + d[_3 ] & = & \\{(x_1 , x_2 , x_3 ) r_12 < r_23 } .",
    "clearly , the first two domains have no common points , but they both have an open , non - empty intersection with the third domain .",
    "thus , on each of these intersections , we have two factorizations of the ope coefficient @xmath185 according to eq .  .",
    "these must hence be equal .",

    "as we have discussed , our definition of quantum field theory is algebraic .",
    "in fact , as argued in sec .  [ coherence ] , up to technicalities related to the convergence of various series , the constraints on the ope coefficients can be formulated in the form of an `` associativity condition '' for the 2-point ope coefficients only , see eq .  .",
    "consequently , the perturbed 2-point ope coefficients will also have to satisfy a corresponding perturbed version of this constraint , and this is in fact essentially the only constraint .",
    "it is this perturbed version of the associativity condition that we will discuss in this section .",
    "our discussion is in close parallel to the well - known characterization of perturbations ( `` deformations '' ) of an ordinary finite dimensional algebra , an analogy which we have already emphasized in another context above . we therefore begin by recalling the basic theory of deformations of finite - dimensional algebras  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath176 be a finite - dimensional algebra ( over @xmath141 , say ) , whose product we denote as usual by @xmath233 .",

    "if we denote the @xmath47-th order perturbation of the product by m_i(a , b ) = a _",
    "b |_=0 , then the associativity condition implies to first order that we should have m_0(idm_1 ) - m_0(m_1 i d ) + m_1(idm_0 ) - m_1(m_0 i d ) = 0 , as a map @xmath180 , in an obvious tensor product notation .",

    "actually , we want to exclude the trivial case that the new product was obtained from the old one by merely a @xmath19-dependent redefinition of the generators of @xmath176 .",

    "actually , the analogues of the symmetry condition  , the normalization condition  , the hermitian conjugation , the euclidean invariance , and the unit axiom should hold as well for the perturbation .",
    "however , these conditions are much more trivial in nature than  , because these conditions are linear in @xmath190 .",
    "these conditions could therefore easily be included in our discussion , but would distract from the main point . for the rest of this section , we will therefore discuss the implications of the associativity condition   for the perturbed ope - coefficients .",
    "as we shall see now , such perturbations can again be characterized in a cohomological framework similar to the one given above .",
    "as above , we will presently define a linear operator @xmath103 which defines the cohomology in question .",
    "the definition of this operator will implicitly involve infinite sums [ as our associativity condition  ] , and such sums are typically only convergent on certain domains .",
    "it is therefore necessary to get a set of domains that will be stable under the action of @xmath103 and that is suitable for our application .",
