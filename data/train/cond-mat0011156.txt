    "<S> the interplay of the electron - phonon interaction and of the double and super exchange magnetic effects is analyzed in the @xmath0 perovskites with @xmath1 . by using an analytical variational scheme that allows to treat the electron - phonon interaction in a fully quantum manner it is shown that in the intermediate electron - phonon coupling regime a charge density instability occurs near the metal - insulator transition , induced by either temperature or hole doping . </S>",

    "<S> the existence of a homogeneous canted phase first proposed by de gennes@xcite in the attempt of explaining the weak ferromagnetism of the phase with @xmath4 has not been confirmed .    in these materials , </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic phase is induced by the combined effect of the @xmath5 electron hopping between nearest neighbor sites and hund s exchange with the localized @xmath6 electron spins : this phase is associated with the properties of a metallic state . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetism is induced by the exchange integral between the @xmath7 shells of adjacent atoms and it is connected with the properties of an insulator state .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study , on the basis of a variational approach , the interplay of the electron - phonon interaction and of the double and super exchange magnetic effects as function of the doping and the temperature in the range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that in the intermediate electron - phonon coupling regime the combined effect of the magnetic and electron - phonon interactions pushes the system towards a charge density instability . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the experimentally observed tendency of the manganites to form inhomogeneous magnetic structures near the phase boundaries due to temperature or @xmath8 concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the metal - insulator transition in these systems is a first order transition@xcite accompanied by the coexistence of two phases : a high density one made by localized small polarons forming paramegnetic or antiferromagnetic domains depending on temperature and a low density one made by itinerant large polarons forming ferromagnetic domains .    from a theoretical point of view </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence between hole - undoped and hole - rich phases has been discussed by using exact numerical approaches on small lattices treating the jhan - teller phonons classically@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , little attention has been given to the quantum nature of the jhan - teller phonons , and , more important , to the possible formation of polarons characterizing the lattice deformations associated to the phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , after millis et al.@xcite , the role of polarons in the manganites has been clearly recognized . </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of the present letter is to show that the two scenario are fully compatible and that the formation of two types of polarons is responsible , together with the magnetic interactions , of the complexity of the manganites in the region @xmath1 .    * the model*. in @xmath9 the electronically active orbitals are the mn @xmath10 orbitals and the mean number of the @xmath7 electrons per @xmath11 is @xmath12 . </S>",

    "<S> the jahn - teller effect splits the @xmath5 double degeneracy@xcite and the single orbital approximation is reasonable for @xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> this choice is related to the approximation first used by tomonaga@xcite in the treatment of the coupling between mesons and nucleons and based on the assumption that all mesons are virtually emitted independently of the others . </S>",
    "<S> it recovers the well known lang - firsov@xcite canonical transformation assuming narrow band small polaron , and , moreover , it provides , in the weak coupling regime , the generalization to the many - body problem of the unitary transformation utilized by lee - low - pines@xcite in the continuum approximation within the frohlich model.@xcite    the second canonical transformation is a bogoliubov transformation . </S>",
    "<S> it introduces correlations between the emission of successive virtual phonons by the electron and it is responsible of the phonon frequency renormalization@xcite : @xmath29   \\label{3r}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 indicates a variational parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the above introduced canonical transformations used to treat variationally the electron - phonon interaction are known to give a satisfactory description of the single polaron problem in all range of couplings being able to interpolate from weak ( large polaron ) to strong ( small polaron ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we adopt the same approach here for a system of interacting polarons . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is worth to note that , in the present case , the utilized approach is expected to be even better than in the single polaron problem . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the choice of richer trial wave function made as a linear superposition of bloch states translationally invariant that , in the single polaron problem , gives a highly accurate description of the polaron features in the intermediate electron - phonon coupling regime,@xcite does not provide any improvement in a many - polaron system since the asymptotic wave functions are orthogonal and the off - diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian are zero in the thermodynamic limit .    </S>",
