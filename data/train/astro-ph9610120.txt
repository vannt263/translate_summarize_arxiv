    "weak lensing is the distortion of the shapes and sizes ( and hence fluxes ) of distant galaxies from tidal deflection of light rays by structures along the line of sight .",
    "this provides a powerful probe of mass fluctuations on a wide range of scales from galaxy haloes ( valdes , 1984 ; brainerd , 1996 ) through clusters ( tyson , valdes & wenk , 1990 ; bonnet , 1993 ; bonnet , 1994 ; dahle , 1994 ; fahlman , 1994 ; smail , 1994 ; smail and dickinson , 1995 ; tyson and fisher , 1995 ; fort , 1996 squires , 1996a ; squires , 1996b ; dahle , 1996 ; fort , 1996 ) to supercluster scales ( valdes , 1983 ; mould , 1994 , villumsen , 1996a ) . as the distortion depends on the distance to the sources",
    " being generally larger for more distant sources  weak lensing also provides a way to constrain the redshift distribution for very faint galaxies ( smail , 1995 ; luppino and kaiser , 1996 ; fort , 1996 ) .",
    "the first quantitative predictions for the distortion effect were made by gunn ( 1967 ) who was primarily interested in what limits this placed on the classical cosmological tests .",
    "dyer and roeder ( 1974 ) estimated the distortion using `` swiss cheese '' models  with results quite similar to modern estimates ( see below )  though they dismissed the effect as too small to have much observational significance .",
    "webster ( 1985 ) computed the increase in ellipticity of distant objects in models with strong small scale mass inhomogeneity .",
    "this is related to the weak lensing effects discussed here , though in fact the broadening of the distribution of ellipticities only appears at second and higher order in the gravitational potential @xmath6 , and vanishes in the ` weak lensing ' limit considered here . in",
    "weak lensing , one considers the galaxy ellipticity to be a 2-component vector - like quantity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the position angle .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath9 vanishes in the absence of lensing , and one searches for a coherent statistical anisotropy of the @xmath9 distribution caused by intervening matter .",
    "quantitative predictions for weak lensing from modern _ ab initio _ models for large - scale structure were made by blandford  ( 1991 ) and miralda - escude ( 1991 ) who computed the rms distortion or ` polarisation ' of distant galaxy shapes and found that it could be quite large  on the order of a few percent in rms shear  for the then popular theoretical models such as cdm , and that the rms shear increased as the @xmath10 power of comoving source distance .",
    "these works also estimated the shear autocorrelation function . in kaiser",
    "( 1992 , hereafter k92 )",
    "this analysis was generalised to include a distribution of source distances , and extended in a number of other ways : it was shown how the angular power spectrum of the shear field was related to the power spectrum of the density fluctuations in three dimensions ; that shear at observable levels on degree scales was an inevitable consequence of density fluctuations inferred from large - scale deviations from hubble flow , or ` bulk - flows ' ( see strauss and willick , 1995 for a detailed review ) ; that the ( fourier transform of the ) projected surface density could be computed from the shear ; and also that one could determine the m / l for foreground structure by cross correlating the foreground galaxy density distribution with the shear .",
    "however , this analysis , like those of blandford , and miralda - escude , was restricted to the einstein  de sitter cosmological background .",
    "more recently , villumsen ( 1996c ) , and bar - kana ( 1996 ) have discussed the distortion in open cosmologies . here",
    "we will explore in more detail how the cosmological background affects weak - lensing observables . in  [ sec : frwlensing ] we give a brief yet self - contained derivation of the distortion tensor  which describes the mapping between angles on the sky at the observer and position on some distant source plane  as a projection of the transverse components of the tidal field along the line of sight . in  [ sec : largescalestructure ] we consider lensing by large - scale structure .",
    "we first derive the relation between the angular power spectrum of the distortion and the power spectrum of the density fluctuations , and we then consider various illustrative models for @xmath11 and then discuss the feasibility of these observations and sampling strategy issues . in  [ sec : clusterlensing ] we consider lensing by individual clusters .",
    "our main goal is to elucidate the dependence of weak lensing phenomena on the background cosmologies ; this will enable us to understand to what extent our conclusions about the mass distribution and the redshifts of faint galaxies are cosmology dependent and , to turn the question around , to see to what extent weak lensing observations , perhaps combined with other observations , can be used to constrain the cosmological world model . in a recent study , bernardeau  ( 1996 )",
    "have also considered some aspects of weak lensing considered here , though their work emphasised more the possibility of measuring higher ( than second ) order moments .",
    "we take as the metric for the homogeneous and isotropic frw background [ eq : frwmetric ] ds^2 = g_dr^dr^ = - dt^2 + a^2(t ) ( d^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) where @xmath12 .",
    "( here @xmath13 measures comoving separation ; we will use uppercase @xmath14 to denote redshift ) .",
    "this is for the open case ; for the closed world model we replace @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the curvature radius @xmath17 obeys [ eq : friedmann ] ( d a dt)^2 = h_0 ^ 2 a_0 ^ 2 ( _ m a_0 a + _ ) 1 with positive / negative curvature term for open / closed models , and where @xmath18 is the expansion rate , a subscript ` @xmath19 ' denotes the present value and where @xmath20 , @xmath21 are understood to be the present values of the density from matter and from the cosmological constant in units of the critical value @xmath22 . evaluating ( [ eq : friedmann ] ) at the present we find that the curvature radius , which we shall use as the scale factor , is related to the current expansion rate by [ eq : a0 ] a_0 = 1 h_0 where @xmath23 .",
    "we will focus on flat and open models ( the former being considered as the limiting case of the latter ) , though it is straightforward to generalise the formulae below to the closed case .    with the addition of small - scale matter inhomogeneity we can take the metric to be [ eq : frwmetricplusperturbations ]",
    "ds^2 = - ( 1 + 2 ) dt^2 + ( 1 - 2 ) a^2(t ) ( d^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) which , on scales much less than the curvature scale , and in cartesian coordinates , becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 which is the usual weak - field solution for a source @xmath26 where @xmath6 satisfies poisson s equation [ eq : poisson ] ^2 = 4 g and where the laplacian is taken with respect to proper distance .",

    "the first term describes the tendency for neighbouring rays to diverge due to the hyperbolic geometry , and becomes negligible in the limit @xmath39 , while the extra forcing term is , as usual , just twice the transverse gradient of the newtonian potential .",
    "the general solution of ( [ eq : ddotx ] ) is [ eq : ddotxsolution ] x_i = a_i + b_i -2 _ 0^d  _ i (  ) ( -  ) which one can readily verify by direct differentiation .",

    "we then consider various illustrative models for @xmath11 of increasing degrees of realism and then discuss the feasibility of these observations , sampling strategy and the prospects for probing large - scale structure _ via _ the amplification rather than shear .",
    "a common problem in astronomy is that one observes some quantity on the sky which is the projection of some three - dimensional random field or point process , and one would like to infer the statistical properties of the latter from the former .",
    "an example is galaxy clustering , where one would like to relate e.g.  the angular correlation function of the galaxy counts @xmath52 to the spatial correlation function @xmath53 .",
    "the solution to this was given by limber ( 1954 ) .",
    "let the projected field be [ eq : fdefinition ] f ( ) = dq ( ) f(_x , _ y , ) where @xmath54 is the spatial field written as a function of comoving coordinates ( all in units of the curvature scale ) and @xmath55 is some radial weighting function .",

    "this is limber s ( 1954 ) equation , which expresses @xmath59 as an integral of the spatial two - point function , if we fourier transform ( [ eq : xifdefinition ] ) we obtain the angular power spectrum @xmath60 . if we define the transforms [ eq : transformdefinitions ]     f ( ) = d^2 f ( ) e^-i f ( ) = d^3 r f ( ) e^-i    then under the assumption that the fields @xmath56 , @xmath54 are statistically homogeneous ( or more specifically that the two point function @xmath61 depends only on separation @xmath62 ) we have [ eq : fourier2ptfns ]     = ( 2)^2 ( -  ) p_f ( ) = ( 2)^3 ( -  ) p_f ( )    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the transforms of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , so from ( [ eq : xifdefinition ] )     p_f ( ) = d^2 w_f ( ) e^-i = p_f ( ) dq^2 ( ) d^2 e^-i(_x - k_x ) _ x e^-i(_y - k_y ) _ y d e^-i k_z ",

    ", it can be thought of as a convolution in log - frequency space of the three - dimensional power spectrum of @xmath54 .",

    "what is the advantage of angular power spectrum analysis ( psa ) over the angular auto - correlation function ?",
    "one minor advantage , as we have seen , the former is somewhat easier to compute from @xmath11 , particularly when there is evolution of @xmath11 .",
    "the real advantage of psa for galaxy clustering , however , is that it is easy to compute the real uncertainty in the power estimates and that the error matrix for @xmath73 is nearly diagonal ; aside from a readily calculable short range correlation one scales @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the dimension of the survey , estimates of @xmath73 at different frequencies are statistically independent .",
    "neither of these pleasant properties hold for correlation analysis . in weak lensing as we shall now see there is a further advantage in that the observable is a symmetric @xmath78 tensor , and there are various correlation functions one can form , and making sense of the inter - relation between these is much simpler in terms of power spectra .",
    "it is now very easy to compute the power spectrum of the distortion @xmath0 in terms of the 3-dimensional density field power spectrum @xmath11 , or equivalently , in terms of @xmath79 , the power spectrum for the potential fluctuations .",
    "the distortion tensor ( [ eq : psi ] ) can be written as the second derivative of a ` projected potential ' : [ eq : psifromf ] _ lm ( ) = _ l _ m _ p ( ) where @xmath80 here and henceforth denotes @xmath81 and where [ eq : phipdefinition ] _ p ( ) = d ( _ x , _ y , ) which is in the form of ( [ eq : fdefinition ] ) with @xmath82 . in fourier space ,",
    "differentiation is equivalent to multiplication by @xmath83 : @xmath84 so @xmath85 and therefore the two point function for the distortion is [ eq : fourierpsi2ptfn ] = ( 2 ) ^2 (  - ) _ i _ j _ l _ m p _ ( ) which nicely factorises into a pure angular term involving the unit wave vector @xmath86  which , as we will discuss below , can be used as a test of the integrity of the data  and the ` distortion power spectrum ' : [ eq : ppsidef ] p _ ( ) = ^4 d p_(/ ; z ) which is a function only of @xmath87 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ppsidef ] ) expresses @xmath0 as a convolution in log - frequency space of the power spectrum of potential fluctuations @xmath79 , or equivalently to the power spectrum of density fluctuations @xmath88 , which is related to @xmath79 , through poisson s equation ( see ( [ eq : ppsifrompdelta ] ) below ) .",
    "villumsen ( 1996c ) has obtained an expression similar to ( [ eq : ppsidef ] ) , but finds a different angular dependence .",
    "we now compute @xmath89 for various models for the 3-dimensional power spectrum @xmath79 .",
    "we first consider the effect of power concentrated at a single spatial frequency .",
    "we next consider power law models and finally we consider empirical models which seem to fit most of the data on galaxy clustering as constructed by peacock ( 1996 ) .      to explore",
    "how the background cosmology affects the interpretation of @xmath0 let us first compute the angular power spectrum for a narrow band of power at some frequency with present physical wavenumber @xmath90 , i.e.  @xmath91 .",
    "inserting this is ( [ eq : ppsidef ] ) , and considering the effect on sources at a single redshift ( @xmath92 so @xmath93 ) we find [ eq : kernel ] p _ ( ) = 8 ^2 where @xmath94 and where @xmath1 vanishes for @xmath95 . here",
    "@xmath96 is the growth factor for the potential , expressed as a function of lookback time .",
    "equation ( [ eq : kernel ] ) is calculated as follows : equation ( [ eq : friedmann ] ) gives @xmath97 as a function of @xmath98 .",
    "starting at some very high redshift we compute @xmath99 to obtain the conformal lookback time @xmath100 as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "we also integrate the equation for the growth of density perturbations : [ eq : densityperturbationgrowth ] d^2 d t^2 + 2 h d dt - g _",
    "m = 0 to obtain @xmath101 for the growing mode .",
    "the result is shown , for three representative cosmological models in figure ( [ fig : ppsiplot1 ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "the angular power spectrum is a bell - shaped curve , peaking at roughly half the maximum angular frequency @xmath102 .",
    "also , the total power increases quite rapidly with increasing source redshift , this trend being strongest for the @xmath2-dominated models .    in figure ( [ fig : ppsiplot2 ] ) we show the total power [ eq : deltapkvariance ]     p _",
    "( ) = 4 ( k_*h_0)^3 ( 1 - _ 0)^-3/2 _ 0^_s df^2(z ) ^2 ^2 ( _ s - ) ^2 _ s    and also the mean ( power weighted ) angular frequency : as a function of source redshift . at low source redshift",
    "the distortion power spectrum is essentially independent of the background cosmology , as one might expect , but at high @xmath103 the low matter density models predict higher distortion .",
    "this is due in part to the fact that @xmath6 decreases with time in these models , and in part to the greater path length back to a given source redshift .",
    "these results for a @xmath68-function @xmath79 are most useful to show what spatial scales we are probing when we measure the angular power at some frequency . for a realistic @xmath79",
    "we will see a blend of angular spectra of the form ( [ eq : kernel ] ) . as a next step towards realism we now model @xmath79 as a power law @xmath104 ( following the usual convention that the density power spectrum scales as @xmath105 ) . to set the normalisation consistently ( corresponding to a given metric fluctuation variance on a given physical scale ) ,",
    "let us take = _ * ( k_k_*)^n-1 = _ * ( k a_0 k_*)^n-1 so @xmath106 is the contribution to the variance of the potential per log interval of angular wavenumber at some fiducial ( physical ) wavenumber @xmath107 , and which gives , for the distortion power per log interval of wavenumber , [ eq : powerlawpomega ] ^2 p _ ( ) / ( 2 ) = 4 c_n(_s ) _ * ( k_*h_0)^1-n ^2 + n where the cosmology dependence is all hidden in the function [ eq : cndef ] c_n(_s ) = ( 1 - _ 0)^(n-1)/2 _ 0^_s df^2(z ) ^2(_s - ) ^n ^2 _ s note that for @xmath108 , which gives equal variance in @xmath49 per log interval of wave - number , ( [ eq : powerlawpomega ] ) and ( [ eq : cndef ] ) are essentially identical to ( [ eq : deltapkvariance ] ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on source redshift is shown in figure ( [ fig : ppsiplot3 ] ) for various values of the spectral index @xmath45 .",
    "it is readily apparent that the distortion power is a strongly increasing function of source redshift in all cosmologies ( though the trend is @xmath45-dependent ) .",
    "we also see that the predicted distortion for high-@xmath14 sources is sensitive to the cosmology , with low matter density models , and @xmath2-models in particular , giving a much stronger predicted signal .",
    "this might seem to be at odds with the conclusions of villumsen ( 1996a ) and bernardeau  ( 1996 ) , both of whom find the distortion to be a strongly _ increasing _ function of @xmath20 ( bernardeau  ( 1996 ) find variance for the top - hat averaged shear approximately proportional to @xmath109 for instance ) .",
    "however , the difference is simply one of normalisation ; we have normalised to a given rms potential fluctuation whereas villumsen and bernardeau  have implicitly normalised to a given rms density contrast , and had we done this it would have reduced our predictions by a factor @xmath110 .",
    "the question of what is the appropriate normalisation is an interesting one , to which there is as yet no completely definitive answer . were it the case that all one knew about the universe was the galaxy correlation function @xmath111 , then one could reasonably make a case for normalising to a given density contrast ; implicitly assuming , in the absence of any evidence to the contrary , that galaxies are unbiased tracers of the mass .",
    "however , there is actually a wealth of data from dynamical studies of various kinds to suggest that the appropriate normalisation for the density contrast is quite strongly @xmath20 dependent ; in high @xmath112 models the galaxy distribution must be biased and it makes sense to fold this into ones predictions for the rms distortion .",
    "one line of evidence comes from small - scale pairwise velocities ; in the regime where these motions are in equilibrium these measure the present potential fluctuations directly , and would therefore lead one to normalise as we have done .",
    "thus , if one assumes a scale independent bias , with @xmath3 tied to small scale ` cosmic virial theorem ' measurements ( davis and peebles , 1983 ) then , as shown in figure [ fig : ppsiplot3 ] , low @xmath20 models then predict much stronger distortion at high @xmath103 ( this assumes that one is using ` real - space ' estimates of @xmath111 ; if one uses redshift survey based estimates then one should allow for the boosting of power due to streaming motions ( kaiser , 1987 ) ) .",
    "another line of evidence comes from peculiar velocities on large scale ; the so - called ` bulk flows ' ( e.g.  strauss and willick , 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the advantage of these observations is that they directly probe the mass , and give a normalisation to the mass fluctuations on large - scales where , as we shall see , we expect weak lensing to be most powerful .",
    "the disadvantage is that they are very hard to measure reliably and estimates of the mass power spectrum derived therefrom have very large ` sampling uncertainty ' as the observations typically probe only a few independent fluctuation volumes .",
    "here the velocity on a given scale is , crudely speaking , given by the potential gradient times the age of the universe , and as the latter is greater in low @xmath20 models we would infer a lower potential fluctuation amplitude for a given amplitude for the streaming motions .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that this reduces the predicted distortion by roughly a factor @xmath113 for low @xmath20 models ( in amplitude , that is , corresponding to a factor @xmath114 in power ) .",
    "the predicted distortion power is shown in figure [ fig : ppsiplot3b ] for this normalisation .",
    "now we find that the greatest distinction between models appears at very low source redshift , but for sources at @xmath4 , and realistic spectral indices , the predictions are only mildy dependent on cosmology and hence on @xmath20 .",
    "a third line of evidence comes from the abundance of clusters as a function of velocity dispersion or x - ray temperature . with e.g.  the press - schechter ( 1974 ) model for the mass function",
    ", these data can be used to normalise the amplitude of mass fluctuations ( cole and kaiser , 1989 ) . in high @xmath112 models , and with the best current data",
    ", this gives @xmath115 ( white ; 1993 ) which is very similar to the scaling from peculiar velocities ; however , since low density models tend to produce power spectra with more large - scale power ( as the horizon size at matter - radiation equality is increased ) , the predicted power at large scales in low-@xmath20 models would not be suppressed as much as with the bulk - flow normalisation and one would expect to find something intermediate between the predictions shown in figures [ fig : ppsiplot3 ] , [ fig : ppsiplot3b ] .",
    "there is still considerable uncertainty in the measurements mentioned above and in their interpretation , and so there is considerable slop in the predicted distortion .",
    "however , we would stress that with any of the normalisation methods described above , and for sources at reasonably high redshift @xmath4 say , and for plausible spectral indices @xmath45 in the range @xmath116 to @xmath117 say , the @xmath2 model predictions are at least as high as in the einstein - de sitter model , and in open models the predicted distortion power is reduced by at most a factor two and certainly not by a factor @xmath118 .      as a final example , we give the distortion power predicted according to peacock s ( 1996 ) model for the linear power spectrum , which , for high-@xmath20 incorporates a mild , though plausible level of bias , and gives a very good fit to most galaxy clustering data .",
    "poisson s equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) gives @xmath119 where @xmath88 is the power spectrum for ( mass ) density contrast , in terms of which ( [ eq : ppsidef ] ) becomes [ eq : ppsifrompdelta0 ] p _ ( ) = 9 ^2 _ m^2 2 ^3 d where @xmath120 is the density contrast power per log interval of wavenumber and should be evaluated at @xmath121 , and at conformal lookback time @xmath13 . for sources at a single redshift",
    "this becomes [ eq : ppsifrompdelta ] p _ ( ) = 18 ^2 _ m^2 ^3 _",
    "0^_sd this , or more generally ( [ eq : gdefinition ] ) and ( [ eq : ppsifrompdelta0 ] ) , is the most convenient form if one wishes to predict the distortion from e.g.  cobe normalised _ ab initio _ models .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : ppsiplot4 ] for peacock s model for @xmath122 , which are quite similar on form to mdm models .",
    "again , we see that the difference between the different cosmological models , when normalised realistically , is quite mild .",
    "the quantity plotted here is @xmath123 , the contribution to the variance of the trace of @xmath124 per log interval , which is four times the variance in the shear @xmath125 or the convergence @xmath126 , so these models are predicting rms shear , convergence @xmath127% for @xmath128 .",
    "this is similar to the predictions of k92 , though in fact the mass fluctuations assumed here are somewhat lower while the adopted redshift is higher to reflect the growing evidence ( both from lensing and spectroscopy ) for a significant high - redshift component at the relevant magnitude limits .",
    "the formalism we have developed allows us to compute the corresponding quantities for any given distribution function for the background galaxy distances , but , generally speaking , the results are very similar to the single source plane results for a single plane at the median distance ( see e.g.  k92 for examples ) .",
    "we have computed above the power spectrum for the distortion tensor @xmath124 .",
    "the quantities we actually measure are the convergence and shear [ eq : kappagammadef ] = _ ll _",
    "= m_lm _ lm where [ eq : mmatrices ] m_1lm = m_2lm = the shear @xmath129 is measured from the shapes of galaxies , while the convergence @xmath126 can be measured directly from the modulation of the counts .",
    "the latter tends to be relatively noisy ( see kaiser , 1994 ) , so we will focus , for the moment , on the shear .",
    "a procedure for estimating the power spectrum @xmath0 was outlined in k92 .",

    "the first step is to take the fourier transform of this set of shear estimates : @xmath134 , which we can write as _ ( ) = d^2 n ( ) _ ( ) e^-i + _",

    "next we convert this to an estimator of the dimensionless surface density @xmath136 as follows : from ( [ eq : kappagammadef ] ) and ( [ eq : psifromf ] ) it follows that the gradients of the surface density and shear are related by @xmath137 ( kaiser , 1995 ) and hence that @xmath138 , or , in fourier space @xmath139 which suggests the estimator [ eq : tildekappaestimate ] ( ) = m_l m _ l _ m _ ( ) = c _ ( ) _ ( ) where we have defined @xmath140 and where @xmath8 is in turn defined by @xmath141 . if one takes the inverse transform of ( [ eq : tildekappaestimate ] ) one obtains the surface density estimator of kaiser and squires ( 1993 ) . here",

    "it is worth noting at this point that if we replace @xmath155 in ( [ eq : tildekappaestimate ] ) by @xmath156 , or equivalently apply the 90-degree rotation @xmath157 to the shear estimates , then the estimated power should vanish ( aside from statistical noise ) .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that while a general shear field has 2 real degrees of freedom only one of them is excited by lensing .",
    "using @xmath155 in ( [ eq : tildekappaestimate ] ) effectively projects out the active component , while @xmath158 projects out the sterile component .",
    "this ` rotation test ' provides a useful check on the integrity of the data , as most sources of spurious image polarisation would be expected to excite both components . for further discussion of this see kaiser , 1994 and stebbins , 1996 .    to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath159 we need to make some further assumptions about the density fluctuations .",
    "we shall assume that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath160 approximate a pair of gaussian random fields .",
    "this is certainly appropriate for density fluctuations arising from inflation , but is also a very good approximation for many highly non - gaussian ( in real space ) processes .",
    "an example is a shot noise process where even for a quite modest number of shots ( say 5 or so ) , the transform of the shots becomes quite accurately gaussian as a consequence of the central limit theorem ( see kaiser and peacock , 1992 , for illustrative examples ) .",
    "the gaussian ( transform ) approximation is also valid for density fields which are non - gaussian due to either non - linear gravitational evolution or biasing . under this assumption",
    "we can calculate the two point function for the ` raw ' power @xmath161 and hence obtain the uncertainty in the shell averaged power . for a filled square survey ,",
    "the two point function of the power is , like @xmath162 , a rather compact function with width @xmath149 , so estimates of the power at wavenumbers separated by more than @xmath163 are statistically independent , and computing the variance in the power averaged over some shell becomes essentially a counting exercise ; one computes @xmath164 , which is the effective number of independent modes , and then divides the mean power ( signal + shot noise ) by @xmath165 ( see feldman , 1994 for an application of this method to galaxy clustering in the qdot redshift survey ) .    for a simple filled square survey geometry",
    "the number of independent modes in each shell is just [ eq : nmodes ] dn_=^2 d ( ) ^2 where @xmath166 is the fundamental frequency .",
    "assuming zero signal one obtains a statistical uncertainty in @xmath167 due to random intrinsic ellipticities of [ eq : measurementnoise ] ( ^2 _ ) = ( _ ^2)^2 ^1/2 = 4 n as noted in k92 , for high-@xmath14 sources the statistical uncertainty is very small compared to the expected signal .",
    "for example , with @xmath168 galaxies per square degree , and @xmath169 ( as obtained from typical cluster lensing studies for integrations of a few hours on a 4 m class telescope ) and for frequency resolution of say @xmath170 , or four bins of power per log interval of frequency , we obtain @xmath171 which is shown in figure [ fig : ppsiplot4 ] for a survey of side @xmath172 degrees .",
    "the measurement noise estimate ( [ eq : measurementnoise ] ) , is a tiny ( @xmath173% ) fraction of the power for our fiducial 3-degree survey field ( assuming peacock s estimate of the power ) , so one would expect , in such a survey , to detect the power at something like the @xmath174-sigma level .",
    "this is very nice .",
    "however , it does _ not _ imply a similar precision in determining the true mean universal power . for low spatial frequencies the uncertainty in the ensemble average power",
    "will be dominated by the fact that we only have a small number of independent modes . for a 3-degree survey ,",
    "the fundamental frequency is @xmath175 , and the fractional uncertainty in @xmath0 at say @xmath176 would be around 50% , rather than 1% .",
    "this ` sampling uncertainty ' is shown as the error - bars in figure [ fig : ppsiplot4 ] and clearly dominates over the measurement noise .",
    "the situation here is very similar to that in galaxy clustering studies from redshift surveys where even though one might have a sample of many thousands of galaxies , the number of independent structures on the largest scales is quite small . in this situation",
    "one can measure the power in one s sample volume to extremely high precision , yet the value need not be representative of the ensemble average power spectrum . whether this ` sampling uncertainty ' is relevant depends on what one wants to use the data for .",
    "one useful application of redshift surveys is to apply the cosmic virial theorem and obtain an estimate of the @xmath112 of matter clustered like galaxies .",
    "this essentially involves taking the ratio of the pairwise velocity dispersion to the galaxy clustering amplitude ( davis and peebles , 1983 ) .",
    "both of these statistics may have large sampling noise , but their _ ratio _ ( under the assumption that there is a universal mass per galaxy ) is not affected by this . similarly , in weak lensing , one can perform a cross - correlation between the shear of the faintest galaxies and the surface number density of somewhat brighter galaxies ( chosen so that their @xmath72 peaks roughly half way to the background galaxies ) , to obtain an estimate of the mass to light ratio ( k92 ) . as with virial analysis , this does not involve the sample variance , and @xmath3 can be measured to extremely high precision using a filled survey .",
    "if , however , one s goal is to use @xmath0 to distinguish between e.g.  the three models shown in figure [ fig : ppsiplot4 ] , then the sampling noise is clearly a serious handicap",
    ".    as with galaxy clustering , sparse sampling ( kaiser , 1986 ) could be quite helpful here .",
    "imagine one were to observe a similar number of galaxies , but with @xmath177 sparsely spaced fields of size @xmath178 scattered over a much larger square ( of side denoted by @xmath77 as before )",
    ". the function @xmath143 , which should be thought of as a ` instrumental point spread function ' through which we measure the power will now be much narrower ( by a factor @xmath179 , where @xmath54 is the areal filling factor of ones survey ) .",
    "this has two benefits ; first , the fundamental frequency would decrease , so one would be able to probe beyond the peak in the spectrum ( clearly an interesting and cosmology dependent attribute ) .",
    "second , in each region of frequency space one will obtain @xmath180 times as many independent estimates of the power , so the sampling uncertainty decreases by a factor @xmath181 , which can be a considerable gain .    there is a price , however , for this increased resolution and precision , which is ` aliasing ' . for a sparse survey , the convolving kernel @xmath162 will now have side - lobes in addition to the central peak which extend to relatively high frequencies @xmath182 , and our power estimator @xmath183 will in general contain some contribution from @xmath184 .",
    "the structure of the side - lobes depends on how one lays out ones fields . if this is done in a random or semi - random manner ( perhaps by choosing a set of fields which avoid few bright foreground objects ) then the side lobes look like ( the square of ) a random gaussian field smoothed on a scale @xmath163 and the mean strength of the side - lobes is suppressed by a factor @xmath185 as compared to the central peak . if the fields are laid out on a grid then the sidelobes are as strong as the central lobe , but are spaced on a grid of spacing @xmath186 and cover only a fraction @xmath54 of the frequency plane .",
    "some examples are shown in figure ( [ fig : surveys ] ) .",
    "there are two aspects to the ` aliasing problem ' ; the first is mixing of power from frequencies similar to the target frequency : @xmath187 .",
    "for a random or grid - like survey this is small provided @xmath188 , and this condition says that one must sample several fields per wavelength of interest . if the fields are laid out in a line , a substantial mixing of power is unavoidable ( as is the case for pencil beam or 2-dimensional redshift surveys ) .",
    "this is not absolutely disastrous , as one can always convolve one s theoretical predictions , but it seems an unwanted and unnecessary complication , and we would discourage this .",
    "also , in order to apply the ` rotation test ' described above it is necessary one has proper 2-dimensional sampling and that the above condition be satisfied .    the second aspect is aliasing of power from higher frequencies @xmath189 .",
    "this is somewhat more model dependent as it depends on how the power varies with frequency .",
    "one finds from ( [ eq : avkappasquared ] ) that the aliased power will be small compared to the power one is measuring from the target frequency , provided @xmath190 .",
    "this again is physically reasonable ; @xmath191 is the number of fields per square target wavelength , so when this condition is only marginally satisfied the small scale power induces a ` root-@xmath130 ' contribution in the low-@xmath153 @xmath126 estimate which is equal to the intrinsic low frequency @xmath126 fluctuations .",
    "thus , if @xmath192 increases strongly towards small scales then one would want to increase the sampling density .",
    "however , if the models shown in figure [ fig : ppsiplot4 ] are a realistic guide @xmath193 is actually falling with increasing frequency , so aliasing from small scales would not be a serious problem , and a rather sparse sampling would pay great dividends with little or no cost",
    ". it may be that this is overly optimistic , since , as mentioned above , non - linearity may boost the power at small scales at late times and cause the predictions shown in figure [ fig : ppsiplot4 ] to underestimate the lensing power . nonetheless , it should still possible to choose @xmath177 so as to make the aliased power small . assuming these conditions",
    "have been met , the power estimate is [ eq : ppsisparse ] p _ ( ) = 4 ^2 n^2 ( ||^2 - n ) and the uncertainty in the distortion power per log interval of wave number is given by [ eq : sparsessamplenoise ] ( ^2 _ ) = ( 1 + n p_4 ^2 ) 4 n ( if there is insufficient rejection of high frequency fluctuations one would need to estimate and then subtract an extra constant term from ( [ eq : ppsisparse ] ) , and there would also be an additional contribution to ( [ eq : sparsessamplenoise ] ) from the fluctuations in the aliased pwer . ) the two terms in ( [ eq : sparsessamplenoise ] ) have opposite dependence on the overall survey size @xmath77 , and the optimum choice ( assuming a fixed instrument and integration time ) is when these two contributions are equal : @xmath194 . for high redshift sources , and for large @xmath130",
    ", this would dictate a very sparse sampling indeed : @xmath195 for @xmath168 per square degree and @xmath196 , but if one also wants to use the same survey to measure the shear for brighter and nearer objects one should adopt a correspondingly less sparse strategy . as a specific example , if one were to spread ones fields over a square say 3 times wider than the filled survey then the sampling uncertainty would decrease by a factor 3 while the ` shot - noise ' term would increase by a factor 3 . for @xmath197",
    "the former would still dominate , at least on large angular scales , and the resulting uncertainty is shown in figure [ fig : ppsiplot4 ] as the error - bars attached to the eds spectrum .",
    "as one can see , the sparse sample has considerable improved precision and one also has better coverage of the behaviour of @xmath0 around the peak as the fundamental frequency is now reduced by a factor 3 also . to design",
    "a truly optimal survey for large - scale structure one really needs to know the true level of small scale power , so it would be prudent to first perform a smaller scale filled survey to establish this empirically .      to close this discussion of large - scale structure , we consider what extra information can be gleaned from estimates of the surface density derived from the amplification . in general",
    ", we expect the rms convergence to be equal to the rms shear , and the convergence can be measured directly as it causes a modulation of the counts of faint galaxies @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is the logarithmic slope of the counts and the factor @xmath200 is known as the ` amplification bias factor ' . at the magnitudes relevant for weak lensing observations @xmath201 ( we will discuss the dependence of @xmath202 on waveband and colour presently ) so large - scale structure will give rise to apparent clustering of galaxies on the sky with amplitude @xmath203 .",
    "now for a power - law spectrum of mass fluctuations in an einstein - de sitter cosmology the variance in @xmath126 grows as @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the mean comoving distance to the background galaxies ( here @xmath206 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if galaxies are unbiased tracers of the mass , then @xmath207 from the intrinsic spatial clustering decreases as @xmath208 ( k92 ) , so , in this model , the relative importance of the lensing induced clustering grows rapidly with increasing source redshift , and there is a crossover at @xmath209 beyond which the induced clustering comes to dominate ( k92 , villumsen , 1996a ) .",
    "as discussed above though , a mass - traces - light normalisation seems untenable for a high @xmath20 universe and in either a low @xmath20 universe , or a biased @xmath210 universe , the expected induced clustering is sub - dominant . in any case , it is not entirely clear how one can separate the two effects observationally ( without accurate redshift information ) .",
    "another possibility is to cross correlate the surface density @xmath126 derived from lensing of faint galaxies with the surface brightness for a sample of brighter objects ( chosen so that their @xmath72 peaks where the @xmath211 for the fainter background galaxies peaks ) .",
    "the procedure for doing this with @xmath126 derived from the shear was described in k92 , but this can equally well be done with @xmath126 derived from the amplification .",
    "there is a slight complication here in that the predicted effect is an anti - correlation of background and foreground galaxy counts ( as the bias factor is negative ) , and this will be diluted ( and perhaps overwhelmed ) by contamination of the ` background ' sample by faint foreground galaxies , so an accurate knowledge of the luminosity function is needed to properly account for this .    for realistically normalised models we find rms @xmath212% on degree scales ( for @xmath196 ) . for a shear based surface density estimate",
    "@xmath213 the uncertainty is @xmath214 and is much less than the expected signal for a survey like that discussed above .",
    "the uncertainty in the amplification derived surface density is @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the power spectrum of galaxy clustering , which can be the angular power spectrum , in which case @xmath45 should be the density of sources on the sky , or @xmath216 can be the spatial power spectrum , in which case @xmath45 should be the three - dimensional number density , the result being the same .",
    "the ratio of the statistical uncertainty for the two techniques is = 2 5 the factor @xmath217 here ( sometimes referred to as @xmath218 ) is an effective clustering multiplicity . for a distribution of randomly placed clusters ,",
    "it is just the number of galaxies per cluster , and quite generally , the factor @xmath219 tells us by how much the variance of counts of galaxies exceeds that for a poisson distribution .    for a power law",
    "angular correlation function @xmath220 , as seems to be a reasonable fit to the data , @xmath221 .",
    "there are now a number of empirical estimates of @xmath207 for faint galaxies which we can use to estimate @xmath222 and some recent estimates ( with @xmath223 ) are : ( 1.52 , couch , jurcevic and boyle , 1993 ; 1.1 ( b ) , 1.6 ( r ) , roche , 1993 ; 1.45 , pritchet and infante , 1992 ; 1.74 , efstathiou , 1991 ; 3.8 , villumsen , freudling and da costa , 1996 ; 1.59 , brainerd , smail and mould , 1995 ) . while these estimates span quite a range of magnitude limits ( the number density varying from @xmath224 per square arcmin for the brighter surveys to @xmath225 for the hubble deep field ) the estimates of @xmath222 are very stable and indicate @xmath226 .",
    "these results are discouraging in the extreme . even on sub - arcmin scales where the clustering becomes negligible ,",
    "the noise in the surface density inferred from amplification is already about 5 times that for the shear based @xmath126 estimates ( so the extra information contained in the amplification is meagre ) , and on larger scales the situation rapidly deteriorates . for cluster lensing ( where one is probing structure on a scale @xmath227 ) and where it might have been hoped that amplification might resolve the ` mass - sheet degeneracy ' problem , clustering has already inflated the uncertainty by a factor 2 or so",
    ", so a cluster like a1689 , which can be detected at the 10-sigma level in the shear , would only be detectable at the @xmath228 level ( i.e.  the diminution of the counts from lensing is about equal to the rms fluctuation expected from galaxy clustering alone ) .",
    "worse still , for the degree scales of interest here @xmath229 and we expect @xmath230 to have grown to around @xmath231 , so the clustering fluctuations exceed the poisson fluctuations by about an order of magnitude .",
    "we reach a very similar conclusion if we use peacock s linearised estimate of @xmath232 ; which is not surprising as this power spectrum model is designed to fit the empirical data .",
    "thus , on degree scales , one would expect @xmath233 ; so the extra information in the amplification based @xmath126 estimate is negligible and , for surveys of the scale envisaged here , one would expect at best a marginal detection of the effect . the relatively high precision allowed by",
    "the shear based surface density estimate relies on the assumption that the intrinsic shapes of galaxies are uncorrelated , and could be compromised if in fact there are strong intrinsic alignments of galaxies on supercluster scales .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to detect correlated orientations of galaxies in superclusters  with the hope of distinguishing between ` top - down ' and ` bottom - up ' structure formation scenarios  but no convincing positive detections have been obtained ( see djorgovski , 1986 for a review ) , and there are no indications from weak lensing observations ( from e.g.  the rotation test ) for any intrinsic alignments at problematic levels .",
    "the counts slope is somewhat waveband dependent ( the counts in @xmath234 are slightly flatter , and those in @xmath235 somewhat steeper than we have assumed ) .",
    "this might suggest that one should use the redder passband , and it has been suggested ( broadhurst , 1996 ) that one would do better by selecting only red galaxies as they have an even shallower counts slope and hence a larger ( negative ) amplification bias . however , this does not help here as it now appears that faint red galaxies lie at relatively low redshift compared to their bluer cousins ( luppino and kaiser , 1996 ) and this outweighs the gain from the flatter slope .",
    "it is somewhat unfortunate , though not entirely coincidental , that the most distant objects ( the faint and blue galaxies ) which suffer the greatest amplification have a very small amplification bias .",
    "we now consider lensing by an individual cluster which is assumed to dominate over the effect of foreground and background clutter . from ( [ eq : distortiontensor ] ) , and specialising to deflections occurring in a single plane , we can write = _ xx + _ yy 2 = _ where @xmath236 is the surface mass density and @xmath237 is the critical surface density : [ eq : sigmacrit ] _ = h_0 ( 1 + z_l ) _ s 4 g _",

    "we have used this to compute the distortion power for a number of illustrative models .",

    "if on the other hand , one were to normalise to some value for the amplitude of large - scale bulk flows ( still unfortunately a rather uncertain quantity ) then @xmath246 for very low source redshift , but for @xmath4 and for realistic spectral indices @xmath45 around @xmath116 to @xmath117 the predicted distortion is only very weakly cosmology dependent . a very similar result is obtained if one normalises to cluster abundances .",
    "this weak dependence on cosmology was also apparent when we computed the distortion power for peacock s fit to galaxy clustering data , where all three illustrative models agree in distortion power to within a factor 2 .",
    "the high density model assumed a rather mild bias @xmath247 , and for stronger bias the difference between the models would be even less .    with a realistic normalisation",
    "we predict rms shear at the @xmath173% level at degree scales for sources at @xmath196 , which should be detectable at the @xmath174-sigma level with a survey covering @xmath248 square degrees ( which would contain @xmath249 galaxies ) .",
    "we found , however , that for a filled survey of this size the sampling uncertainty would much larger than the measurement noise , particularly at the largest scales which in some ways are the most interesting .",
    "for some applications the sampling uncertainty is irrelevant , but for the tests described above it is a serious handicap .",
    "the sampling noise can be reduced considerably by adopting a sparse sampling strategy ( at some small cost in increased measurement noise ) .",

    "<S> we explore the dependence of weak lensing phenomena on the background cosmology . we first generalise the relation between @xmath0 , the angular power spectrum of the distortion , and the power spectrum of density fluctuations to non - flat cosmologies . </S>",
    "<S> we then compute @xmath1 for various illustrative models . </S>",
    "<S> a useful cosmological discriminator is the growth of @xmath1 with source redshift which is much stronger in low matter density models , and especially in @xmath2-dominated models . with even crude redshift information ( say from broad band colours ) </S>",
    "<S> it should be possible to constrain the cosmological world model . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of @xmath0 is also quite sensitive to the cosmology , but requires a reliable external normalisation for the mass fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> if one normalises to galaxy clustering , with @xmath3 fixed by small - scale galaxy dynamics , then low density models predict a much stronger distortion . if , however , one normalises to large - scale bulk - flows , the predicted distortion for sources at redshifts @xmath4 is rather insensitive to the background cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the signals predicted here can be detected at a very high level of significance with a photometric survey covering say 10 square degrees , but sparse sampling is needed to avoid large sampling variance and we discuss the factors influencing the design of an optimum survey . turning to weak lensing by clusters we find that for high lens redshifts ( @xmath5 ) the critical density is substantially reduced in @xmath2 models , but that the ratio of the shear or convergence to the velocity dispersions or x - ray temperature of clusters is only very weakly dependent on the cosmology .    </S>",
