    "the accretion of gas by a young star by means of an accretion disk ( called a protoplanetary disk in the connection to planet formation ) is fundamental to its evolution .",
    "typical accretion rates of young stars are on the order of @xmath2 yr@xmath1 decreasing with the age of the disk @xcite .",
    "the inner edge of a protoplanetary disk is unique with respect to accretion as matter is transported from a high - density outer disk ( optically thick ) to a depleted inner region ( optically thin ) .",
    "specific to the edge is the direct illumination of solids by stellar light . in recent years",
    ", the motion of small particles at the edge by photophoresis was considered , assuming the solids to be  test particles ",
    ", with no feed - back of the particle motion to the gas @xcite .",
    "as an extreme , the whole inner edge of the disk might move outward @xcite .",
    "however , if all particles at the edge are subject to photophoretic forces , the response of the gas can no longer be neglected .",
    "in fact , on one side , photophoretic forces push solids away from a light source ( star ) . on the other side ,",
    "focusing attention on the gas , photophoresis is based on a motion of gas molecules towards the light source ( star ) and every illuminated particle acts like a small micro pump , pushing gas radially inward .",
    "temperature gradients on a solid surface induce gas flows and particle motion .",
    "a prominent example of particle motion is the light mill @xcite .",
    "a less known but nonetheless impressive example of gas flow is the knudsen compressor .",
    "tubes with a cross section of the order of the mean free path of the gas molecules heated at one end allowed @xcite to compress a gas by a factor of about 10 @xcite .",
    "we consider temperature gradients induced by absorbing a light flux @xmath3 at an inner edge of a protoplanetary disk here , varying with distance @xmath4 as @xmath5}{1 \\mathrm{au}}\\right)^{-2}$ ] with @xmath6 w m@xmath7 .",
    "the absorption leads to a small temperature difference @xmath8 on a particle with radius @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 as the temperatures at the illuminated warm front side and cold back side , respectively . assuming perfect absorption at the front side it is @xcite @xmath12 with the thermal conductivity of the particle taken to be @xmath13 w/(m k ) .",
    "gas molecules at ambient average temperature @xmath14 diffusely scattered from a local surface for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the knudsen number , acquire the local surface temperature @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "this induces a photophoretic force on the particle which accelerates the particle . in equilibrium with the gas drag force",
    "the final velocity of the particle is @xcite @xmath17 it is @xmath18 the accommodation coefficient of the gas molecules , @xmath19 an empirical factor @xcite , @xmath20 the asymmetry factor ( internal heat sources of the illuminated particle ) , @xmath21 j mol@xmath1k@xmath1 the universal gas constant , @xmath9 the particle radius and @xmath22 kg mol@xmath1 the molar mass of the gas .    the gas in the disk moves inward with the particles velocity times the fraction of dust @xmath23 ( momentum balance ) , i.e. @xmath24 . at the inner edge of the disk the stellar radiation is completely absorbed .",
    "if the transition is filled with particles of one size @xmath9 , every particle acts as a micro pump ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the total gas mass flow is then @xmath25 with @xmath26 as the surface density . to quantify this we assume a minimum mass solar nebula @xcite with @xmath27}{1 \\mathrm{au}}\\right)^{-3/2}$ ] g cm@xmath7 , @xmath29}{1 \\mathrm{au}}\\right)^{-1 / 2}$ ] and @xmath30 k. this leads to a total mass flow per year @xmath31}{1 \\mathrm{au}}\\right)^{-9/4},\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath32",
    "@xmath33 yr@xmath1 m@xmath1 contains all gas and particle properties . in figure 2",
    "we show the dependency of the giant solid state pump on the position of the inner edge in the protoplanetary disk , the particle size and the fraction of dust @xmath34 ( solid lines ) and @xmath35 ( small dashed lines ) .",
    "in addition , we compare the gas mass flow rates with accretion rates of turbulent disks ( large dashed lines ) with @xmath36 and @xmath37 as turbulence parameter , @xmath38 as sound speed and @xmath39 as keplerian angular velocity @xcite .    .",
    "the lines for the different particle sizes end at @xmath40 where the hydrodynamic regime changes @xcite .",
    "the large dashed lines indicate the accretion rate of turbulent discs for different @xmath37 parameters , the small dashed lines are mass flow rates for a dust fraction of 1 and the solid lines are for a dust fraction of 1/100.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the mass flow rates through the inner edge of a minimum mass solar nebula estimated above can be as high as @xmath41 @xmath33 yr@xmath1 for dust fractions of 1 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the mass flow rates calculated are beyond accretion rates of t - tauri disks close to the star and fall below these at some au distance but the solid state pumps act only locally at the inner edge .    if the general viscous evolution were very slow ( no gas accretion ) , the inner edge would just drain a reservoir on the dark side and increase the ambient pressure on the bright side . as the first phases of planet formation",
    "are tied to gas and particle concentrations this might influence local formation of larger bodies in the disks @xcite ."
