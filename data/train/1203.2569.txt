    "in , probabilistic models are employed for estimating the probability that a relevance or generation relationship exists between the information conveyed by a document and a user s information need represented by a query or any other user s action , such as browsing , document retention or click - through .",
    "these models requires an event space , which consists of a set of events and a probability measure , thus two event spaces differ due to either the events or the probability distribution .",
    "sets of events are employed for representing the occurrence of documents , terms , queries , relevance , aboutness , and their inter - relationships ; for example , the intersection of the set which represents a document and the set of relevance represents the event that the document is relevant . for every single event space ,",
    "a probability distribution @xmath0 exists such that , for any pair of events , we can write the conditional probabilities as @xmath1 the latter is known as , which is different from which states that , for any pairs of events , @xmath2 while is a postulate , permits to compute probability distributions through the probability update mechanism provided by  . note that implies but the _ vice versa _ does not hold .",
    "finally , and mostly important , the events whose probabilities used to compute the conditional probabililities through belong to a single probability space .",
    "some simple numerical examples in  @xcite point out that there might be something wrong or imprecise when defining the event space .",
    "in particular , some contradictions were noted when conditional probabilities are estimated from distinct event spaces and are then combined together by using since as the events whose probabilities used to compute the conditional probabililities through come from a single probability space .",
    "it was noticed that can not be applied without asking some questions and that some measurements expressed in terms of events or random variables are simply ill - defined .",
    "the contradictions found in  @xcite can be briefly explained as follows .",
    "suppose that we are given two conditional probabilities @xmath3 calculated by using , and we are also told that @xmath4 do not necessarily come from a single event space .",
    "in other words , these probabiilities are _ estimated _ under different _ contexts _  @xmath5 has been estimated under @xmath6 and @xmath7 has been estimated under a _",
    "context @xmath8 where the conditioning events ( i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath8 are the contexts ) .",
    "hence a single measure @xmath0 may not exist such that   holds  @xcite .",
    "another question is whether may still hold when the probabilities are estimated under different contexts .",
    "suppose one is provided with an estimation of @xmath9 from three different event spaces s refers to different event spaces . ] . by summing the right - hand side of   over @xmath10",
    ", we have that @xmath11 whose sum over @xmath6 yields @xmath12 , the latter being called .",
    "hence , the following probability distributions are provided :    * @xmath13 from event space @xmath14 , * @xmath15 from event space @xmath12 , * @xmath16 from event space @xmath17 , * @xmath18 from event space @xmath19 , * @xmath20 from event space @xmath21 .    however , one can not choose the probability distributions at any degree of freedom .",
    "some inequalities constrain the set of admittable probability distributions .",
    "consider @xmath22 .",
    "hence , for every @xmath13 , we have that @xmath23 or @xmath24 or equivalently @xmath25 inequality   is named statistical invariant in  @xcite and is necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a valid @xmath26 . in particular ,",
    "when the event space is supposed to be boolean and then event intersection such as @xmath27 can be appropriately defined and observed , the violation of   tests the existence of a single event space equipped with event intersection . if   was not admitted , one can not state that the observed @xmath28 come from a single event space , and is violated .",
    "it seems that a violation of   is detriment to effectiveness because , one may suppose , a `` wrong '' model of the world can not provide nothing but `` wrong '' results .",
    "in contrast to intuition , as it often happens , some experiments have shown that the violation can lead to improvements of retrieval effectiveness  @xcite .",
    "these results are briefly described in the following section .",
    "it was observed that the terms that correspond to @xmath29 and violates  , are those that increase average precision more frequently and significantly than those do not .",
    "( event @xmath10 means relevance . ) the experiments reported in  @xcite aimed at answering the following question : `` if the term suggested by the system to the user to expand the original query was so that the probability of occurrence violates the , is the retrieval effectiveness measured on the new list of retrieved documents higher than that measured on the original list of retrieved documents ? '' .    [",
    "fig : scatterplot - n20-k10-a ]    the experiments performed in  @xcite have suggested a relationship between the variation in mean average precision and the statistical invariant  [ eq:6 ] as depicted in figure  [ fig : scatterplot - n20-k10-a ] .",
    "a point of this plot corresponds to a value of fraction of and an increase of .",
    "the plot suggests that if the statistical invariant can not be admitted and the ltp is violated , that is , if the selected term can not be drawn from a sample whose probabilities have been estimated by aa single event space built from a set of relevant and non - relevant documents , then the increase in retrieval effectiveness may be observed and not only when the probability of occurrence of the selected term admits the invariant .",
    "this experimental observation naturally lead to the question whether behind the violations of seemingly necessary theoretical invariants , are some potential for even further improving effectiveness .",
    "something like this hypothesis has been formulated , for example , in  @xcite where the unification of logic , probability and vector space geometric within a single non - classical framework shapted by has been suggested as a useful direction to this end .",
    "it follows that , other inequalities can be formulated that their violation can reveal , from the one hand , the inconsistency between experimental observations and the model , but , on the other hand , the directions toward a further development of probabilistic models for .",
    "the inequalities used throughout this article are illustrated in appendix  [ app : inequalities ] and are based on  . in spite of the title , the contribution of   is not only an explanation of the role played by complex numbers in quantum mechanics , but it gives sufficient and necessary conditions for the admissibility of the conditional probabilities by a or space .",
    "the topic was further investigated in  @xcite .",
    "an system is trained on how to rank documents on the basis of the past interactions between the user and the system .",
    "these training data are recorded , for example , in a log - file or observed during a session in which the user searches for documents which fill his own information need .",
    "a notable example of training is relevance feedback and its several variations .",
    "when a system is trained by feedback the training data can be described as a table .",
    "each tuple is an elementary event and one value is observed for each attribute and for each elementary event ; for example , a tuple refers to a relevant document and the other attributes refer to the presence or absence of index terms .    for the sake of clarity and for making the illustration close to an ir scenario , three",
    "observables @xmath4 are considered in this section ; one can imagine that @xmath10 refers to a set of relevant documents , @xmath6 refers to the set of documents indexed by a term and @xmath8 refers to the set of documents indexed by another term .",
    "this simplification does not eliminate the generality of the results because it will in the following be shown that some important properties will be violated even in this simple scenario , and therefore will in general be violated . at any rate , the most general case will be addressed in section  [ sec : prp ] .",
    "the set of tuples of the table which stores the training data can represent the event space . therefore , @xmath10 is both an attribute and the subset of elementary events with that attribute ; similarly , @xmath27 is another subset of elementary events .",
    "an example is illustrated in figure  [ fig : log - file-0 ] .",
    "the set of tuples of figure  [ fig : log - file-0a ] for which both terms occur , i.e. , @xmath30 , is an event labeled @xmath4 and placed in the first column of figure  [ fig : log - file-0b ] ; the last number of a column of figure  [ fig : log - file-0b ] is the cardinality of this event and it is used for computing the probability that both terms occur  ",
    "the tuples that do not occur ( e.g. @xmath31 ) have null probability .",
    "when moving to the conditional probabilities , @xmath32 is the probability that a term has been observed in a relevant document , @xmath33 is the probability that the other term has been observed in a relevant document , and @xmath34 is the probability that a term has been observed when the other term has also been observed .",
    "suppose also that the frequencies of figure  [ fig : log - file-0b ] are used for estimating the probabilities by using .",
    "the example of figure  [ fig : log - file-0 ] obviously is a single event space and indeed inequality  [ eq : accardi-1 ] holds .",

    "@xmath35 are estimated from distinct collections , or 3 .",
    "the value of an observable is missing in the data for a few tuples .",
    "when the probabilities are estimated by a mixture of , say , frequencies and additional knowledge , different sources are combined for estimating the probabilities @xmath35 .",
    "this may happen , for example , in the approach when other sources of evidence , such as additional log - files or collection term frequency distributions , are exploited for adding some parameters and for smoothing probabilities .",
    "a linear combination is a well - known method for smoothing probabilities thus obtaining @xmath35 as follows : @xmath36 suppose that @xmath37 by using inequality  [ eq : accardi-1 ] , one can check that @xmath35 do not admit a single event space and can not be applied for computing @xmath5 and @xmath38 .",
    "a similar case happens when @xmath35 are estimated from distinct collections ; in this case , the experimental conditions yielding the probabilities are different and can not be compared although the relevance assessments were given in the best possible way .",
    "this may happen , for example , when a document is stored in a collection , another document is stored in another collection and the query is routed to both these collections for retrieving and ranking the two documents in a single list .",

    "one can easily check that @xmath45 and that @xmath46 the three conditional probabilities estimated from @xmath43 do admit a single event space for each @xmath47    indeed , one single measure @xmath48 can be defined as the frequency of the elementary events in @xmath49 for each subset @xmath49 of @xmath43 .",
    "suppose that a query has to be submitted to a broker which has to decide the @xmath43 to which the query has to be routed .",

    "the reason was that the probabilities @xmath56 come out from distinct spaces which describe two different experimental conditions .",

    "depending on how the conditional probabilities are estimated , a single event space holds or does not .",
    "an estimation may only involve ten elementary events for which either @xmath10 or @xmath57 is known so that @xmath58 another estimation may also involve the tuples for which neither @xmath10 or @xmath57 is known so that @xmath59 when the latter estimation is used , inequality  [ eq : accardi-1 ] is violated and therefore the single event space can not hold .",
    "this outcome is little surprising when using the table of figure  [ fig : log - file-1 ] because the universe of the elementary events has two tuples for which a value is missing or unknown .",
    "a shrewd experimenter will avoid such a situation , yet it should be noted that a great deal of attention should be paid when conditional probabilities are provided by some `` black - box '' device or when the dataset includes missing values .    in the rest of this section , an example more extensive than the three - observable toy example is reported .",
    "the example aims at illustrating how the mathematical concepts described above can arise when designing an information retrieval experiment .",
    "in particular , it is shown how the estimation of a prior probability is a crucial step .",
    "the use of a small collection , such as the cacm of this example , is not detrimental to the generality of the results because even a small test collection or an experiment setting may contain a counter - example which invalidates the hypothesis of single event .",
    "the use of a larger collection would have provided more counter - examples .",
    "the test collection was indexed so as to relate each one - keyword term to the documents in which it occurs . before computing term frequencies ,",
    "the stopwords provided with the test collection were removed from the documents .",
    "no stemming was computed . after indexing ,",
    "the probability of relevance was first computed for each query as the relative frequency between the number of relevant documents and the total number of documents .",
    "second , the probability of observing a term was computed as the relative frequency between the number of documents indexed by the term and the total number of documents .",
    "third , the terms whose probability of occurrence was equal to the probability of relevance were selected , for each query .",
    "finally , the probability of co - occurrence of every pair of two selected terms was computed , for each query .",
    "for example , the term ` infinity ` occurs in four documents and co - occurs with ` translates ` in one document ; both terms have the same probability of occurrence as the probability of relevance to queries ` 23 ` or ` 30 ` which have four relevant documents .    in terms of probability ,",
    "the universe of elementary events was the collection of documents . for each document , the property `` the document was indexed by a term '' and the property `` the document is relevant to a given query '' were observed ; specifically , the latter property or observable was @xmath10 , whereas @xmath60 refer to two terms observed in a document .",
    "therefore , the probability of relevance was @xmath61 and the probability of observing a term was @xmath62 where @xmath63 or @xmath64 . from these probabilities ,",
    "the conditional probabilities were computed . specifically , the probability that a relevant document was indexed by @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath65 was computed as the relative frequency of relevant documents indexed by @xmath8 . in the same way ,",
    "the conditional probability of co - occurrence , i.e. @xmath66 was computed as the relative frequency of documents indexed by @xmath8 were indexed also by @xmath6 .",
    "for example , only one relevant document ( # ` 2786 ` ) was indexed by ` infinity ` and therefore @xmath67 .",
    "a sample of the results is reported in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "the first row of the table includes a simple example which admits a single event space since , whenever a term is observed in a document , it is certain that the other term or relevance is observed too . given a query , two terms whose probability of occurrence equals the probability of relevance are associated with the conditional probability of co - occurrence and the conditional probability of relevance .",
    "stands for `` it admits a '' , re stands for `` it admits a real '' and co stands for `` it admits a complex '' .",
    "when a term admits a single event space , it admits a complex too , yet a real one may not be admitted as shown by the second row and are here mentioned to stress the fact that three observed conditional probabilities may admit a variety of theories of probability and not only the single event . ] .",
    "the probabilities of the third row admit a real , and then a complex one , while the single event space is not admitted .",
    "the last one is an instance that a can not be sufficient and that another space should be defined .",
    ".a sample of the conditional probabilities computed for the terms selected from the cacm test collections is reported in this table . [",
    "cols=\"^,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us concentrate on the third row . if one compiled a table which enumerates all the elementary events    one event for each document    then each row of that table would include a binary value which indicates the presence / absence of a term , another binary value which indicates the presence / absence of the other term , the document identifier and a binary value which indicates whether the document is relevant or not . if such a row is added for each document , an @xmath68-row table is obtained , where @xmath68 is the total number of documents .",
    "one would easily check that a probability measure can be defined and therefore would find that a single event space can be defined .",
    "so , why does table  [ tab : sample ] say that k is not admitted ?",
    "the reason is due to the fact that accardi s inequalities described in appendix  [ app : inequalities ] can be applied only if @xmath69 ( and similarly states the same for @xmath6 and @xmath8 ) , the latter being a hypothesis valid only if @xmath70 .",
    "this means that those inequalities must be checked only if @xmath69 .",
    "what is the impact of the results illustrated in the previous sections on the prp ?",
    "suppose that two documents have to be ranked .",
    "one document is represented by @xmath6 , the other by @xmath8 .",
    "when the observed conditional probabilities do not admit a single event space , the probability of relevance of @xmath6 can not be confronted to the probability of relevance of @xmath8 . when these two probabilities can not be confronted , the ranking is questionable .",
    "an explanation is that the probabilities are hinged on different measures , each defined by a distinct single event space which is an abstraction of a distinct experimental condition . in order to make the ranking sound ,",
    "a single measure is needed , which is provided by a single probability space such as a . however , a single probability space is not sufficient for applying    for example , can not be invoked if a is used .",
    "these issues are addressed in the rest of the article ; in particular , the general case of an arbitrary number of documents to be ranked and then the impact on the prp are investigated .",
    "let us now consider the general case .",
    "suppose @xmath71 documents are to be ranked by the probability of relevance    relevance is then the @xmath72-th observable .",
    "the events corresponding to the documents are @xmath73 , whereas the event corresponding to relevance is @xmath10 , so the estimated probabilities are @xmath74 for all @xmath75 .",
    "the correlation vector of probabilities @xmath76 used in pitowsky s theorem  [ prop : pitowsky-0 ] can be built as follows : @xmath77    now , suppose that @xmath76 does not admit a single event space , that is , there is no set of values of @xmath78 such that @xmath76 can be expressed as a linear combination of fixed correlation vectors built from the @xmath79 binary strings ( see appendix  [ app : pitowsky ] ) .",
    "suppose , then , a subset of the @xmath72 probabilities ( or events ) is selected and that the @xmath80 probabilities @xmath81 are considered . as a consequence ,",
    "the bivariate probabilities @xmath82 are computed from the corresponding events . in total , a @xmath83-dimensional correlation vector @xmath84 is observed .",
    "if this correlation vector admits a single event space , then two single event spaces will be found since the probability left apart admits one distinct space .",
    "if @xmath84 does not admit it , then the other similar correlation vectors are built by leaving one of @xmath85 apart at a time . if no @xmath83-dimensional correlation vector admits a single event space , then the process is repeated by leaving two events apart until a single event space is admitted for @xmath86 events .",
    "the probability of relevance @xmath87 can be left last .",
    "it is known that the process will certainly end finding a single event space because the single @xmath88 does always admit it .",
    "this means that eventually every document or relevance may be represented as an observable of a space being distinct from all the spaces which represent the other documents or relevance .",
    "let @xmath76 be a correlation vector for ( not necessarily disjoint ) @xmath72 events which does not admit a single event space .",
    "then , there exist at least two subsets of events whose probabilities admit a single event space .",
    "[ cor : proof ]",
    "the main conclusion which can be drawn from corollary  [ cor : proof ] is that , whenever one has to rank @xmath89 documents by probability of relevance , a great deal of attention should be paid as to whether these probabilities admit a single event space or not .",
    "as mentioned above , the ranking of documents whose probability of relevance is computed from distinct spaces should be treated with due caution because the presence of distinct spaces would signal the use of different experimental conditions in which the probabilities of relevance were computed .",
    "even if one decided to compare these probabilities despite the presence of distinct spaces , some properties of single event spaces , such as or distributivity , can not be used since they are grounded on a single space .",
    "it is our opinion that a new canvas is needed for probabilistic retrieval which overcomes the problems arising when some observed conditional probabilities can not admit a single event space which is at the basis of the classical probabilistic retrieval models .",
    "such a canvas should be based on for some reasons explained in the rest of this section .    in ir , it was conjectured that `` if ir models are to be developed [ ... ] , without further empirical evidence to the contrary it has to be assumed that subspace logic will be non - classical . ''",
    "the conjecture is the same as that made in quantum mechanics where hilbert s spaces are taken as the theoretical framework for explaining how the phenomena studied by physics happen in nature at the particle - level .",
    "whenever two observables @xmath90 are measured on a particle , the event @xmath27 , that is , the event that both @xmath10 and @xmath6 occurs , often does not make sense , that is , the design of an experiment which can determine @xmath10 and @xmath6 can not in principle be implemented because the measurement of @xmath10 interpheres with the measurement of @xmath6 and thus nothing can be said about their co - occurrence .",
    "if non - classical logic has to be assumed in ir too , the intersection of events can not be assumed and as a consequence the events observed in ir can not derive from the co - occurrence of events and then modeled as the intersection of sets . for example , one can not observe both relevance and document as an event like @xmath27 .",
    "nonetheless , the phenomena usually dealt with in physics at the particle - level do not at first sight occur in ir and the proposal of using hilbert s spaces does not imply that ir systems exhibit a quantum behaviour ; it rather means that the mathematical framework is general enough for describing documents , queries and the retrieval of relevant information in a comprehensive way .    for measuring the uncertainty of the observation when non - classical logic has been supposed , has been suggested .",
    "a probabilistic retrieval function based on was illustrated in  @xcite where a new model for information retrieval was proposed for capturing the contextual properties being hidden in an object managed by an ir system . according to that proposal ,",
    "the contextual properties are modeled as bases of a complex vector space and each value , called contextual factor , taken by these properties is modeled as one of the basis vectors .",
    "the probability that a contextual factor occurs in an object was modeled as the square of the inner product between the vector which represents the factor and the vector which represents the object , and was termed as probability of context .",
    "however , some questions were left unanswered .",
    "an unanswered question in  @xcite was why the abstract vector spaces would be a better framework than other mathematical theories .",
    "a possible answer was provided in  @xcite : hilbert s spaces encompass different models for information retrieval , such as the probabilistic model and the vsm .",
    "that answer stemmed from the conjecture that the use of non - classical logic is reasonable unless there is some evidence to the contrary . that notwithstanding , it was our opinion that it is still unclear why such a conjecture is necessary , and as a consequence , why is necessary in ir and a further explanation was necessary .",
    "the results of the previous sections may provide an explanation of why is necessary in ir , that is , some conditional probabilities do not admit a single event space and therefore bayes results can not be applied .",

    "[ [ app : hilbert ] ]    when hilbert s spaces are considered , the events observed in an experiment or in the real world are modeled as _",
    "subspaces _ , that is , every event corresponds to a subspace of a larger , perhaps infinite dimensional , hilbert s space . as in ,",
    "a subspace is nothing other than an abstraction of an event , and the theory of hilbert s spaces together with its operations are an abstraction of the different ways the events can occur in the real world .",
    "according to that framework , documents , terms , queries , relevance , aboutness are events modeled as subspaces .",
    "while sets and are widely used in ir , subspaces are not employed at all for modeling events .",
    "an exception is  @xcite where hilbert s spaces were introduced for establishing a new theoretical framework encompassing different models proposed by the ir community over the years .",
    "what is important to note is that the operations commonly defined for sets are not always defined for subspaces ; for example , the notion of union thought for sets can not be defined on subspaces because the union of two subspaces is not a subspace , while the linear span of two subspaces is .",
    "the opposite holds too , i.e. , the linear span which is defined for subspaces can not be defined for sets",
    ". however , there may be analogies    the complement of a set corresponds to an orthogonal subspace and both may model the negation of an event , yet the complement of a subspace is not the same as the complement of a set : the former is the set of vectors orthogonal to the vectors of the set , the latter is the set of vectors not in the set .",
    "when probability is entered , the subspaces used for modeling the events of a real world or an experiment are subjected to a measure , that is , a real function of the subspaces of a hilbert s space .",
    "the measure is then used for computing the probability of the events modeled by the subspaces . in this way , the uncertainty of the occurrence of an event can be measured even when sets are replaced with subspaces . in the case , therefore , the probability space is given by subspaces and a `` '' function , as illustrated in the following .",
    "as before , let us consider a mathematical formulation .",
    "according , the events @xmath101 are modeled as subspaces @xmath102 of the space . which models an event @xmath10",
    "  from now on , @xmath103 means the subspace too .",
    "@xmath104 is called bra - ket notation and was introduced by p. dirac in _ the principles of quantum mechanics _ , oxford university press , 1958 .",
    "] the definition of the probability of an event modeled by a subspace is different from that of the same event but modeled by a subset .",
    "indeed , the probability of an event modeled by a subspace depends on a subspace and can then be considered as a conditional probability defined as @xmath105 where the modulus of the inner product between the two vectors is called _ amplitude_. in ir terms , equation  [ eq : h - prob ] is the probability that , say , a document described by index term @xmath106 is relevant .",
    "the same applies when @xmath107 models , for example , terms , aboutness , or document clusters .",
    "the conditional probabilities can be defined for both and , yet they are defined in different ways .",
    "what is different is that are inherently conditional because the probability of an event is conditioned to a subspace , which refers to another event .",
    "moreover , the conditional probabilities in theory are symmetric since @xmath108 therefore , the conditional probabilities used in the article become @xmath109",
    "suppose there are three observables with @xmath72 possible values each . without loss of generality , and for making illustration",
    "easier , it is assumed that @xmath110 , that is , each observable has two mutually exclusive values , e.g. , @xmath111 . as for ir , @xmath6 might be the event that a term is observed in a document , while @xmath112 is the event that the term is not observed and @xmath10 ( @xmath57 ) may denote the event that a document is ( not ) relevant and so on .",
    "of course , three observables only is a small example , but the fact that the single event space can not be admitted even when only three observables are examined suggests that it can not be admitted in more general cases .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath113 as in  .",
    "when is used , the symmetry of the conditional probability implies that @xmath114 this `` symmetry '' may well happen in an ir context ; for example , the probability that a given index term is chosed for a relevant document , that is , @xmath65 , may equal the probability that the document is assessed as relevant if it has been indexed by the index term .",
    "the fact that the conditional probabilities are usually asymmetric is due to the use of and then of which in fact makes @xmath5 different from @xmath115 . when is used , one measure @xmath97 exists such that @xmath116 suppose , for example , that @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "it can easyly be seen that the measures of the co - occurring events can be computed as @xmath119 things change when other values of @xmath35 are estimated from sources independent of each other , for example , as @xmath120 the surprising result is that when the values of equations  [ eq : example-2 ] are considered , a measure @xmath97 can not be defined in a way such that the probability of @xmath27 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 exist    no single event space can admit those values of @xmath35 .",
    "the values of equations  [ eq : example-2 ] are not the only possible values and an infinite number of values of @xmath35 exist such that the events do not admit a meausure according to .",
    "as estimates the conditional probabilities on the basis of , it follows that , @xmath124 since @xmath125 can not be calculated .",
    "if the co - occurrence of events , e.g. @xmath27 was observed , and the frequency of these co - occurring events were available , an estimation of @xmath125 would be possible thus making valid .",
    "when @xmath97 can not be defined for some observed conditional probabilities , one has to conclude that the co - occurrence of events is impossible , namely , statements like `` both @xmath10 and @xmath6 occur '' do not make any sense . the inequality which acts as the test of the existence of a single event",
    "is proven in   and is stated as    @xmath35 admit a single event space if and only if @xmath126 [ prop : accardi-1 ]    when inequality  [ eq : accardi-1 ] is violated , neither measure @xmath97 nor sets @xmath127 can be defined for the observables @xmath4 such that holds .",
    "inequality  [ eq : accardi-1 ] provides for a simple test to check if the conditional probabilities estimated in different experimental conditions are compatible with a single event space .",
    "the question is then , what is the probability space if that single event is incompatible ?",
    "the answer was provided in   and is reported here without proof .",
