    "the is one of the best studied radio pulsars and was the first one found to be associated with the supernova remnant ( snr ) ( @xcite ) . in spite of its relative proximity to the earth",
    ", there is still no consensus on the value of its ( transverse ) velocity , which is connected with the yet unsolved problem of the distance to the vela pulsar / vela snr . the first attempt to estimate the pulsar velocity",
    "was made by @xcite , whose optical measurments gave an upper limit on the pulsar proper motion ( @xmath0 ) . however",
    ", even the maximum admissible value of the pulsar proper motion was found to be too low to explain the pulsar offset from the apparent geometrical centre of the vela snr , which questions the pulsar / snr association .",
    "later , it was recognized ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) that the real extent of the vela snr is much larger than was accepted in early studies , so now there can be no doubt that the vela pulsar and the vela snr are the remnants of the same supernova explosion .",
    "however , this association has caused some problems in estimating the pulsar velocity .",
    "@xcite questioned for the first time the canonical value of the distance to the vela snr of 500 pc given by milne ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) and suggested that this distance should be reduced to some smaller value ( @xmath1 pc ) .",
    "since that time many additional arguments in support of this suggestion have been put forward ( gelman et al .",
    "@xcite , oberlack et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , cha et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the arguments ( proposed by gelman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and repeated by oberlack et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and cha et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ) was based on the comparison of the vela pulsar transverse velocity ( inferred from the new estimate of the pulsar proper motion by gelman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ) with the scintillation velocity ( reported by cordes ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "it is known that proper motion velocities of pulsars show significant correlation with pulsar velocities inferred from interstellar scintillation measurements ( e.g. @xcite , gupta @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , assuming that the scintillation velocity @xmath2 is a true value of the pulsar transverse velocity , gelman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that @xmath3 ( cordes @xcite ) could be reconciled with the proper motion @xmath4 if the distance to the vela pulsar ( and the vela snr ) is about @xmath5 pc .",
    "the distance reduction might be even more dramatic if one takes the recent high - precision estimate of the vela pulsar proper motion ( @xmath6 ) obtained by de luca et al .",
    "( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the situation with the distance to the vela snr was improved after gupta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that the scintillation velocity calculation formula used by cordes ( @xcite ) underestimates @xmath2 by factor of 3 .",
    "the revised value of the scintillation velocity of the vela pulsar of @xmath7 better corresponds to the proper motion velocity of @xmath8 ( for the distance to the pulsar of 500 pc and @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , the real situation is a bit more complicated .",
    "it should be noted that the calculations of gupta ( @xcite ) were based on the assumptions that the scattering material is concentrated in a thin screen and that the screen is placed midway between the observer and the pulsar .",
    "although the first assumption is realistic , the second one is not suitable in the case of the vela pulsar .",
    "indeed , it is believed that the scattering irregularities responsible for the enhanced scattering of the vela pulsar ( @xcite ) are localized in a thin screen rather than uniformly distributed along our line of sight to the pulsar ( @xcite , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , and that the scattering screen resides close to the pulsar and could be associated with the shell of the vela snr ( desai et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see however gwinn et al .",
    "@xcite,@xcite and cf .",
    "the asymmetrical location of the screen implies ( see sect .",
    "2 ) that the actual value of the scintillation velocity should be considerably larger than that given by gupta ( @xcite ) and that the scintillation velocity is not equal to the proper motion velocity .    in this paper , we show that if the scattering of the vela pulsar indeed occurs in the shell of the vela snr then the scintillation velocity could be reconciled with the pulsar proper motion velocity only if the scatterer has a nonzero transverse velocity .",
    "a possible origin of large - scale transverse motions in the vela snr s shell is discussed .",
    "the scintillation velocity for an asymmetrically placed thin scattering screen is ( gupta et al .",
    "@xcite , gupta @xcite ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the scintillation bandwidth and the time - scale measured respectively in mhz and seconds , @xmath13 is the distance from observer to pulsar in kpc , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the distances from observer to screen and from screen to pulsar , @xmath17 is the frequency of observation in units of ghz . for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( cordes @xcite ) , @xmath21 , and assuming that @xmath22 , one finds for the vela pulsar that @xmath23 ( gupta @xcite ) . as we mentioned in sect .",
    "1 , desai et al . ( @xcite ) showed that the scattering screen is close to the pulsar . assuming that @xmath24 pc",
    ", they found that @xmath25 , and that this value could be increased up to 0.96 if @xmath26 of the scattering of the vela pulsar is due to the effect of the .",
    "the latter value of @xmath27 is expected if the scattering material is mainly concentrated in the shell of the vela snr of angular diameter of @xmath28 ( the figure accepted in early studies of the vela snr ) .",
    "assuming that the vela snr s shell is indeed the main scatterer of the vela pulsar and using the currently adopted angular size of the vela snr of @xmath29 , one has @xmath30 or @xmath31 , and correspondingly @xmath32 .",
    "in the observer s reference frame , the scintillation velocity is connected with the pulsar proper motion velocity @xmath33 where @xmath34 is measured in mas@xmath35 , by the following relationship ( cf .",
    "gupta et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath36^{1/2 } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the components of the transverse velocity of the screen , correspondingly , parallel and perpendicular to the vector of the pulsar proper motion velocity . in ( [ 3 ] ) we neglected small contributions from the differential galactic rotation and the earth s orbital motion around the sun . if @xmath39 , one has @xmath40 , i.e. about 3 times smaller than that from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "these velocity estimates could be reconciled only if the distance to the vela pulsar is @xmath41 , which is too small to be likely .",
    "the pulsar , however , could be placed at its canonical distance if @xmath42 .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the 843 mhz image ( @xcite ) of the central part of the vela snr , known as the radio source ( milne @xcite ) .",
    "a considerable fraction of the radio emission from velax originates in filamentary structures , one of which crosses the vela pulsar position .",
    "this filament ( or rather its part to the south of the pulsar ) is known as a radio counterpart of the vela x - ray jet discovered by @xcite . in gvaramadze ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", we found that some of radio filaments of the velax and the x - ray jet show a fairly good correlation with optical filaments , and concluded that the jet is a dense filament in the vela snr s shell , which is projected by chance near the line of sight to the vela pulsar .",
    "we also suggested that filamentary structures visible throughout the vela snr in radio , optical and x - ray ranges have a common nature and that their origin is connected with projection effects in the rayleigh - taylor unstable shell of the remnant .",
    "the rayleigh - taylor instability results from the impact of the supernova ejecta / shock with the pre - existing wind - driven shell created by the supernova progenitor star ( see gvaramadze @xcite ) , and induces in the shell large - scale transverse motions ( laterally expanding domelike deformations of the shell ) . the existence of laterally expanding deformations naturally explains ( gvaramadze @xcite ) the unusual velocity field inferred by @xcite from the study of absorption lines in spectra of background stars ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the high - velocity absorption features were found not only in the central part of the vela snr but also near the edges of the remnant , which suggests that the expansion velocity of the shell deformations has comparable radial and transverse components .",
    "the same conclusion follows from the interpretation of uv spectra of face - on and edge - on shock waves in the vela snr ( @xcite ) . a characteristic expansion velocity of shell deformations inferred from the absorption data and uv spectra is about @xmath43 , while some portions of the shell expand with much higher velocities .",
    "proceeding from the above , we suggest that the radio filament projected on the vela pulsar is a large - scale deformation of the vela snr s shell viewed edge - on , and that this deformation has a significant transverse velocity .",
    "we assume that the deformation lies on the approaching side of the vela snr s shell and suggest that the turbulent material associated with the shell deformation is responsible for the scattering of the vela pulsar ( cf .",
    "desai et al .",
    "the line of sight extent of the scattering material could be estimated to be @xmath44 pc ( for @xmath45 pc ) given that the width of the filament is @xmath46 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and assuming that the characteristic size of the shell deformation is @xmath47 .",
    "the geometry ( the curvature ) of the filament projected on the vela pulsar suggests that this part of the shell expands in the northwest direction , i.e. just parallel to the vector of the pulsar proper motion velocity ( gelman et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . for @xmath48 ,",
    "one has from ( [ 3 ] ) that @xmath49 for the transverse velocity of the pulsar of @xmath50 ( i.e. for @xmath45 pc ) and for @xmath31 and @xmath51 , one has that @xmath52 is 80 or @xmath53 .",
    "the first estimate is quite reasonable , while the second , though not impossible , looks less likely .",
    "it should be noted , however , that eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) gives reasonable values for @xmath52 not only for @xmath24 pc .",
    "e.g. for @xmath54 pc , one finds that @xmath52 is equal to 30 or @xmath55 . from this , we conclude that the scintillation data taken alone do not allow us to put meaningful limits on the distance to the vela pulsar and therefore to get a reliable estimate of the transverse velocity of the pulsar .",
    "the forthcoming direct measurement of the distance to the vela pulsar through its parallactic displacement ( see de luca et al .",
    "@xcite ) will solve the problem .",
    "the main assumption made in this paper is that the enhanced scattering of the vela pulsar is due to the effect of the vela snr .",
    "this assumption is based on the result of desai et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that the scattering material could be associated with the shell of the vela snr ( see sect .",
    "2 ) . in this case",
    ", the parameter @xmath56 has a fixed value , which depends only on the angular size of the vela snr s shell , and therefore is independent of the distance to the pulsar .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the result of desai et al .",
    "( @xcite ) was derived from use of scintillation observables ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the referee ( j.cordes ) pointed out that the quite large uncertainties in observables result in uncertainty in the value of the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "he attracted our attention to the papers by gwinn et al .",
    "( @xcite,@xcite ) , from which follows that the value of @xmath56 could be much smaller than that adopted in our paper .",
    "the values of @xmath56 given in these papers ( respectively , @xmath57 and @xmath58 imply that the scattering material can not be connected with the vela snr .",
    "we now discuss this possibility .    for @xmath57 ( gwinn et al .",
    "@xcite ) , one obtains and @xmath59 as in sect .",
    "@xmath60 . note that now @xmath2 is independent of @xmath61 since @xmath62 ( see e.g. @xcite and eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath2 could be reconciled with @xmath63 only if @xmath64 : @xmath65 or @xmath66 for @xmath67 kpc ; @xmath68 or @xmath69 for @xmath70 kpc .",
    "these transverse velocities are too high to be attributed to the expansion of the shell of the gum nebula ( cf .",
    "@xcite with @xcite ) , though it is not impossible that they could characterize the expansion of a foreground small - scale hii region projected by chance on the vela pulsar .    for @xmath71 ( gwinn et al .",
    "@xcite ) , one obtains @xmath72 .",
    "one can show that just for this value of @xmath56 ( or more exactly for @xmath73 ) the transverse velocity of the screen could be equal to zero ( see eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) ) , and therefore @xmath74 .",
    "although these estimates show that the situation with the scattering screen is indeed quite uncertain , we believe that the enhanced scattering of the vela pulsar is most likely connected with the shell of the vela snr .",
    "an argument in support of this belief is the fact that the elongated scattering disk of the vela pulsar ( gwinn et al .",
    "@xcite ) is nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field of the radio filament projected on the vela pulsar .",
