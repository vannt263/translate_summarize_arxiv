    "the wentzel - kramers - brillouin or the wkb approximation @xcite , sometimes also known as the bwk @xcite , the semiclassical approximation or the phase integral method @xcite has been widely used in the evaluation of the half - lives of radioactive nuclei . it was evident from the historical papers of gamow @xcite and condon and gurney @xcite that one could treat the alpha decay of nuclei in terms of the tunneling of a preformed @xmath0-particle confined to the interior of the nucleus , through the coulomb potential barrier of the alpha - nucleus system .",
    "the wkb approximation which is really applicable when a problem can be reduced to a one - dimensional one was found suitable to evaluate the barrier penetration probabilities and the decay width in general was defined as a product of the frequency of collisions of the @xmath0 with the barrier ( the so - called assault frequency ) and the penetration probability .",
    "the objective of the present work is to critically examine the decay widths obtained within some entirely different approaches to the tunneling problem , however , all working within a wkb framework . to be specific ,",
    "we examine four approaches ; the first a two potential approach ( tpa ) @xcite , another a path integral method with jost functions @xcite , a third one using comparison equations to obtain improved wkb formulae @xcite and a fourth one involving a super asymmetric fission model ( safm ) @xcite .",
    "it is gratifying to know that all the four approaches indeed lead to the same formulae for the wkb decay widths .",
    "a wkb expression for the vibrational energy , @xmath1 , emerges from the above comparisons . for the first three approaches , the vibrational energy ( and hence the assault frequency )",
    "can be simply evaluated from the potential and the tunneling particle energy . in the safm",
    "however , the equation for @xmath1 turns out to be a transcendental equation .",
    "however , this equation is often neglected by the safm calculations in literature and a fit to the vibrational energies is performed , leaving the calculation somewhat incompatible with the wkb framework .    besides this",
    ", the widths calculated within the safm often neglect the bohr - sommerfeld condition and the langer modification which are essential ingredients of the wkb framework .",
    "the langer modification is a necessary transformation while going from the one dimensional problem with @xmath2 ranging from @xmath3 to the radial one - dimensional tunneling problem with @xmath4 ranging from @xmath5 . to demonstrate the importance of performing a completely consistent wkb calculation of widths , we perform a realistic calculation of the alpha decay widths of super heavy nuclei which are a topic of current interest .    with most radioactive decays occurring away from the extremes of the potential barrier ,",
    "the standard wkb is found to be a reasonable approximation for such calculations .",
    "however , for specific cases , where the tunneling can occur near the top or the bottom of the barrier , the validity of this approach becomes questionable .",
    "some attempts at obtaining improved formulae which can be used near the extremes of the barrier do exist @xcite and will be investigated by applying to realistic examples in the present work .    the alpha - daughter nucleus interaction in the present work",
    "is described using folding model potentials with a realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction @xcite .",
    "such a model has been shown to be quite successful in predicting half - lives of unstable nuclei @xcite .",
    "we perform calculations with the added ingredient of a density dependent nn interaction and find the results and fitted parameters sensitive to this input . in the next section , we perform a comparison of the different wkb approaches as mentioned above . in section iii , we briefly present the relevant formulae of the potentials used .",
    "the results are discussed in section iv .",
    "starting with the description of a radioactive nucleus as a cluster of its daughter nucleus and an alpha particle , it is by now standard practice to study the alpha decay of nuclei as a tunneling of the @xmath0 through the potential barrier of the alpha - daughter nucleus system .",
    "though most quasiclassical approaches agree on the proportionality of the decay width to an exponential factor , namely , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the famous gamow factor , the details of the calculations vary depending on the approach used .",
    "typical potential for an alpha - nucleus tunneling problem.,width=302,height=188 ]    typically , one considers the tunneling of the @xmath0 through an @xmath4-space potential of the form , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the nuclear and coulomb parts of the @xmath0-nucleus ( daughter ) potential , @xmath4 the distance between the centres of mass of the daughter nucleus and alpha and @xmath11 their reduced mass .",
    "the last term represents the langer modified centrifugal barrier @xcite . with the wkb being valid for one - dimensional problems , the above modification from @xmath12",
    "is essential to ensure the correct behaviour of the wkb scattered radial wave function near the origin as well as the validity of the connection formulas used @xcite .",
    "another requisite for the correct use of the wkb method is the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition , which for an alpha with energy @xmath13 is given as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the number of nodes of the quasibound wave function of @xmath0-nucleus relative motion and @xmath17 and @xmath18 which are solutions of @xmath19 , are the classical turning points ( as shown in fig .",
    "1 ) . we shall now examine the decay widths obtained within different wkb based approaches to the above problem .",
    "starting with a typical potential as in fig .",
    "1 , the authors in @xcite consider the tunneling problem of a metastable ( quasistationary ) state and obtain a perturbative expansion for the decay width of the metastable state .",
    "the potential is split into two parts , @xmath20 , where the authors first consider an unperturbed bound wave function @xmath21 , which is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is a perturbation and when it is switched on , @xmath21 is not an eigenfunction of @xmath24 , but one rather has a wave packet which is expressed as an expansion in terms of @xmath21 and the continuum wave functions , @xmath25 . once the perturbative expansion for the width is obtained in terms of the wave functions , retaining the first term and expressing the wave function using the semiclassical wkb approximation , the width is given as , @xmath26^{-1}\\,e^{-2\\int_{r_2}^{r_3}\\,k(r)\\,dr}\\ ] ] where , @xmath27 .",
    "the factor in front of the exponential arises from the normalization of the bound state wave function in the region between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , this factor is related to the so - called ` assault frequency ' of the tunneling particle at the barrier . expressing the time interval , @xmath28 , for the particle traversing a distance , @xmath29 as , @xmath30 the assault frequency @xmath31 can be written as the inverse of the time required to traverse the distance back and forth between the turning points @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xcite , @xmath32^{-1}\\,\\,.\\ ] ] thus , @xmath33 , where , @xmath34 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above definition of the period @xmath35 ( which is twice the time spent between the turning points @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , is formally similar to that of  traversal time in tunneling \" as defined by bttiker and landauer @xcite .",
    "they defined the time for a particle traversing the barrier and hence obtained a similar definition as that for @xmath36 above , but within the limits @xmath18 to @xmath37 .",
    "the width obtained in the two potential approach is in accord with the widths obtained in @xcite and @xcite for energies well away from the top or the bottom of the barrier .",
    "for example , in @xcite , considering a double humped ( dh ) barrier in one dimension ( with cartesian coordinates ) and using the method of comparison equations , the decay width for all energies except near the very top or the very bottom of the barrier was found to be , @xmath38\\ ,   \\simeq\\,2\\,\\hbar\\,\\nu_{dh}\\,e^{-2w}\\ ] ] where , @xmath39 is the assault frequency in the case of a double humped barrier . replacing @xmath40 , for small values of the exponent",
    ", @xmath41 indeed reduces exactly to @xmath42 .",
    "the width for energies of the tunneling particle near the bottom of the well was found in @xcite to be , @xmath43\\,\\simeq\\,\\alpha^{-1}\\,\\gamma_{dh}(e_n)\\,,\\ ] ] where , @xmath44^{n+1/2}$ ] .",
    "the relation obtained in @xcite using the tpa is somewhat different , namely , @xmath45 it is mentioned in @xcite that the above result coincides with that in @xcite obtained using complex - time path integral methods @xcite .",
    "the prefactors in front of the exponential factors in the expression for the widths in @xcite depend on characteristic parameters of instanton trajectories , however , the above modification in ( [ gurwidthlow ] ) does agree in form with that obtained in @xcite . though the tpa approach and that of comparison equations in @xcite do give the same expressions for the widths away from the extremes of the barrier ( @xmath46 was seen above )",
    ", they do not seem to agree on the situation at low energies .",
    "eqs ( [ shepwidthlow ] ) and ( [ gurwidthlow ] ) seem to give very different results .",
    "for example , for @xmath47 respectively , one finds that @xmath48 and @xmath49 , whereas , @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively . in @xcite",
    ", one can find yet another expression for tunneling near the bottom of the barrier such that the tunneling probability at the base of the barrier vanishes exactly .      in @xcite , the decay width within the wkb approximation at the top of the barrier",
    "was also evaluated and found to be , @xmath52   \\over \\biggl [ \\ , t_{dh}\\ , -\\ , 2\\,\\hbar\\,{d\\phi \\over de}\\,\\biggr]}\\ , , \\ ] ] where , @xmath53 is the period for moving back and forth between the two humps and @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "a very similar formula was also found in @xcite , however , with a difference of a sign in the denominator .",
    "having derived the expressions for the jost function of a radial barrier transmission problem ( with one hump ) by the path integral method , the authors obtain the following expression for evaluating the width at the top of the barrier : @xmath55 \\over   \\biggl [ \\ , t\\ , -\\ , 2\\,\\hbar\\,{d\\sigma \\over de}\\,\\biggr]}\\ , .\\ ] ] the numerators in ( [ froformula ] ) and ( [ sheptop ] ) for energies near the top of the barrier are almost equal , i.e. , @xmath56\\,\\simeq\\,\\hbar \\rm{ln}\\,[\\,1\\,+\\,e^{-2w}\\,]$ ] . with the period ,",
    "@xmath53 being twice as much as @xmath35 and the factor @xmath57 , eqs ( [ sheptop ] ) and ( [ froformula ] ) indeed agree but up to a sign in the denominator . in eq .",
    "( 5.7 ) of @xcite , however , one can see that there exists a choice for the sign appearing in front of @xmath58 and the authors choose the negative sign without any particular justification .",
    "we shall later notice with a realistic example near the top of the barrier , that it is indeed the choice of a positive sign in the denominator which improves the wkb width estimate .",
    "the choice of a positive sign also brings ( [ froformula ] ) in agreement with ( [ sheptop ] ) .",
    "we now move on to discuss one more approach which is popularly used in literature and has off late been often used for the evaluation of the half - lives of superheavy nuclei .",
    "an approach where the alpha decay is considered as a very asymmetric fission process was introduced about two decades ago by poenaru and co - workers @xcite .",
    "this model , also known as the super asymmetric fission model ( safm ) has recently been implemented extensively for the evaluation of the wkb widths of superheavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the decay width of a metastable state in the safm within the wkb framework is given as , @xmath59 where , @xmath60 is the probability of penetration through the potential barrier , @xmath1 is the  vibrational energy \" , @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the gamow factor with @xmath64 over here differs from the @xmath65 occurring in the equations so far as obtained in @xcite due the energy @xmath13 of the tunneling particle being replaced by @xmath66 . replacing the assault frequency @xmath31 from eq .",
    "( [ period ] ) into the above eq .",
    "( [ safm ] ) , we indeed recover an expression similar to that of @xmath42 , with the @xmath67 replaced here by @xmath68 .",
    "the safm width is , @xmath69^{-1}\\,e^{-2\\int_{r_2}^{r_3}\\,\\kappa(r)\\,dr}\\ ] ] where we have approximated @xmath70 for sufficiently large @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , if we start with the definition of @xmath71 ( as defined in the safm based works @xcite ) and use eq .",
    "( [ period ] ) for @xmath72 , we obtain a theoretical relation for @xmath1 , namely , @xmath73^{-1}\\,\\,.\\ ] ] one could have of course inferred the above equation ( [ vibenergy ] ) simply by the comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ safm ] ) and ( [ safm2 ] ) .",
    "provided the potential is known , for a given energy @xmath13 of the tunneling particle , eq .",
    "( [ vibenergy ] ) is a transcendental equation for the vibrational energy @xmath1 .    comparing the expressions for the widths , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , away from the extremes of the barrier ( taken in the limit of large @xmath65 and negligible @xmath77 )",
    ", one can see that indeed , @xmath78^{-1}\\,e^{-2\\int_{r_2}^{r_3}\\,k(r)\\,dr}\\,.\\ ] ] @xmath79 agrees exactly in form with the above formulae for widths .",
    "the only difference lies in the replacement of @xmath13 by @xmath80 as mentioned before .",
    "it is interesting to note that even though the prefactor in front of the exponential in @xmath74 arises due to the normalization of the wkb wave function , it agrees exactly with the prefactors in @xmath75 and @xmath76 where it arises due to the replacement of the assault frequency as in ( [ period ] ) .",
    "coming back to eq .",
    "( [ vibenergy ] ) , one notices that for a given potential , @xmath81 , in a particular decay problem with a given @xmath82-value , @xmath1 can be determined by resolving eq .",
    "( [ vibenergy ] ) .",
    "however , starting from the pioneering works of poenaru and co - workers until some recent ones , @xmath1 is fitted to reproduce the half - lives under consideration .",
    "there is no mention in these works of the fitted value being consistent with ( [ vibenergy ] ) .",
    "such a fitting procedure performed without a consistency check with eq .",
    "( [ vibenergy ] ) would be somewhat ambiguous and outside the spirit of a proper wkb calculation . without the condition ( [ vibenergy ] ) ,",
    "@xmath1 becomes simply a parameter to compensate for the mismatch of the theoretical width with experiment .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath1 as a vibrational energy and its addition to the @xmath82 value ( @xmath83 ) giving , @xmath84 , is then not justified .",
    "the above point will be clarified with realistic examples of the calculation of half - lives of superheavy nuclei in section iv . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the potentials used for the calculations of the present work .",
    "with the objective of the present work being a critical examination of the various semiclassical methods used for the evaluation of alpha decay half - lives , we perform calculations using different available inputs in literature . the potential in ( [ pot1 ] ) is written using a double - folding model with realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions as given in @xcite .",
    "the folded nuclear potential is written as , @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the densities of the alpha and the daughter nucleus in a decay and @xmath88 is the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "@xmath89 is the distance between a nucleon in the alpha and a nucleon in the daughter nucleus .",
    "@xmath90 is written using the m3y nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction as in @xcite as , @xmath91 the alpha particle density is given using a standard gaussian form , namely , @xmath92 and the daughter nucleus density is taken to be , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is obtained by normalizing @xmath95 to the number of nucleons @xmath96 and the constants are given as @xmath97fm and @xmath98fm .",
    "the equation ( [ potnucl ] ) involves a six dimensional integral .",
    "however , the numerical evaluation becomes simpler if one works in momentum space as shown in @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath99 is determined by imposing the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition ( [ bohrsomer ] ) using the above potential .",
    "the number of nodes are re - expressed as @xmath100 , where @xmath7 is a global quantum number obtained from fits to data @xcite and @xmath101 is the orbital angular momentum quantum number .",
    "we shall perform calculations with two possible fitted values of @xmath7 @xcite , namely , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the coulomb potential is obtained using a similar double folding procedure with the matter densities of the alpha and the daughter replaced by their respective charge density distributions @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "thus , double folding the proton proton coulomb potential , @xmath106 the charge distributions are taken to have a similar form as the matter distributions , except for the fact that they are normalized to the number of protons in the alpha and the daughter .",
    "one could further improvise the double folding potential by taking into account the density dependence of the nn interaction @xmath107 .",
    "for example , in @xcite a reasonably good description of elastic alpha - nucleus scattering data was obtained by assuming a factorized form of the density dependence as follows : @xmath108 where , @xmath109 , with @xmath110 being either the @xmath0 or @xmath111 . the parameters , @xmath112 and @xmath113 were found to be energy independent and @xmath114 and @xmath115 @xmath116 for the range of analysed data between alpha particle energies of 100 mev and 172 mev .",
    "due to the lack of much information , for the case of super heavy nuclei , @xmath112 was chosen to be unity and @xmath117 @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "we note here that even if the potential is improvised with the density dependence of the nn interaction included , the bohr - sommerfeld condition should still be satisfied in the wkb framework . as we shall see later ,",
    "the normalization @xmath99 in ( [ potnucl ] ) is different from unity even for the above interaction .    in order to test the applicability of the formulae ( [ sheptop ] ) and ( [ froformula ] ) at the top of the barrier",
    ", we shall examine the case of the @xmath118 , @xmath119be resonance which decays @xmath120 into two alphas .",
    "the nuclear potential for the @xmath0-@xmath0 case is taken to be @xcite , @xmath121 since the aim of the present work is to make a comparative study and not fit parameters to match the theoretical widths with the experimental ones , the alpha particle preformation probability for all the calculations in this work has been taken to be unity .",
    "the objective of the calculations performed for the superheavy nuclei is to test the sensitivity of the results to ( i ) the implementation of the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition ( [ bohrsomer ] ) which fixes the strength of the potential @xmath99 in ( [ potnucl ] ) , ( ii ) the ` fitted ' global quantum number @xmath7 appearing in ( [ bohrsomer ] ) , ( iii ) the density dependence of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath122 ) interaction and finally ( iv ) to verify if the fitted vibrational energies used in literature are consistent with the theoretical eq .",
    "( [ vibenergy ] ) . some recent works @xcite on superheavy elements in literature neglect ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iv ) from above . in what follows , we shall see that the exact values of the decay widths of the nuclei considered do depend strongly on the ingredients ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iv ) and hence any conclusions drawn in works which neglect these aspects of the wkb framework would have to be treated with caution .      in tables",
    "i and ii , the half lives @xmath123 , of some currently discovered superheavy nuclei are shown for two different choices of the global quantum number @xmath7 of the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition .",
    "since all the decays discussed in tables i and ii take place at energies @xmath83 which are away from the extremes of the barrier , we use @xmath124 which in turn is the same as evaluating @xmath125 or @xmath126 as shown in ( [ compare3 ] ) .",
    "theoretically , the @xmath82 value of the decay is defined as the difference of the masses of the parent nucleus and the sum of the masses of the alpha and the daughter nucleus ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "we shall however use the @xmath82 deduced from the measured @xmath0-particle energies , @xmath128 , by applying a standard recoil correction as suggested by perlman and rasmussen @xcite and frequently used in literature . with @xmath129 and @xmath130 being the charge and mass numbers respectively of the parent nucleus , @xmath131    the results obtained using eq .",
    "( [ nnfree ] ) for the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction are labelled as  free - nn \" in tables i and ii .",
    "the density dependent nn interaction ( @xmath122 ) calculations use eq .",
    "( [ nninside ] ) instead of @xmath107 in ( [ potnucl ] ) and are also shown in the tables .",
    "one can see that the introduction of density dependence in the nn interaction reduces the lifetimes @xmath132 by an order of magnitude as compared to the free nn results . neglecting the bs condition ( i.e. @xmath133 ) however , ` increases ' the @xmath134 by two orders of magnitude as compared to the proper @xmath122 calculation using the bs condition with @xmath99 around 2 .",
    "any conclusions based on calculations neglecting the bs condition can hence be quite misleading . in an ideal case ,",
    "when the potential @xmath9 is known exactly for a particular system , one would expect @xmath99 in ( [ potnucl ] ) which gets fixed by the bs condition to be unity .",
    "one can however see that using the ` free nn ' interaction , the value of @xmath99 ranges around @xmath135 , while for the @xmath122 case it is in the range of @xmath136 .",
    "it is however interesting to note that the value of @xmath99 hardly depends on the mass or atomic number of the parent nucleus for the considered range of nuclei .",
    "the parameter @xmath112 in ( [ nninside ] ) was in fact chosen to be unity due to lack of information .",
    "one could rather choose @xmath137 and @xmath138 leading to a @xmath99 close to 1 for the @xmath122 cases in tables i and ii respectively .    comparing the numbers in tables i and ii",

    "the orbital quantum number @xmath101 was taken to be zero .",

    "such examples are indeed difficult to find among the alpha decay of nuclei .",

    "to summarize , we first performed a survey of the available wkb decay width formulae in literature , which were obtained using different models and approaches .",
    "after having noted the similarities as well as differences in the various approaches , we applied them to the calculation of the half lives of super heavy nuclei which form a topic of current interest . the motivation to apply for the case of superheavy nuclei was also to emphasize the need for performing calculations remaining consistently within the spirit of the wkb approximation .",

    "the sign flip is consistent with the theory in @xcite , since at some point in their derivation one encounters a choice of signs .    to compare theoretical wkb widths with experiment , it is mandatory to perform a consistent calculation , taking into account carefully the details like the langer modification , bohr - sommerfeld condition and a theoretically derived vibrational energy .",
    "we conclude by mentioning that any attempt to extract physical information from fitted parameters ( such as the alpha cluster preformation probabilities or the unknown angular momenta of superheavy nuclei ) while calculating the half lives within the wkb approximation should bear in mind the limitations introduced in the model due to the sensitivities mentioned above .",
