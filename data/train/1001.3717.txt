    "one of the key technologies in next generation systems for achieving high throughput and providing better coverage is _",
    "relaying_. relaying has attracted a high level of recent research interest with several papers focusing on various aspects of communicating using relays with different constraints and assumptions . in this work ,",
    "we are concerned with the capacity of multistage relaying from one source to one destination through an arbitrary network of half duplex relays .",
    "an example network that we consider in detail for ease of explanation and clarity is the two stage relay network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] . in this 6-node network",
    ", the source node @xmath0 intends to communicate with the sink node @xmath1 through 4 relay nodes @xmath2 connected as shown .",
    "the channel gains ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) are shown next to the corresponding edges .",
    "for simplicity , some of the gains are assumed to be identical . for a multistage half - duplex relay network such as the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] , we study coding methods and protocols needed to achieve the best possible rate from source to destination for different ranges of the channel gains .",
    "there are two different aspects to multistage relaying when the relays are connected in an arbitrary fashion : ( 1 ) scheduling transmissions by nodes , and ( 2 ) coding methods employed by nodes during transmissions .",
    "one strategy for scheduling is to avoid interference altogether .",
    "however , the maximum data rate under interference avoidance ( ia ) is limited , because the source is transmitting only for a fraction of the total time . to improve upon ia , more states of the network with the source node in transmit mode need to be considered .",
    "the scheduling task is to determine those states that are crucial for obtaining higher rates .",
    "when multiple nodes transmit , interference network states are created in the network based on the connectivity .",
    "two important interference network states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] for the network of fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] . in one state ,",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are transmitters and , in the other state , @xmath6 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are transmitters . in both the states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] , the source node is a transmitter and the destination node is a receiver .",
    "this property improves the flow of information , and is useful for improving the transmission rate from the source .    in each interference network state , three different coding strategies of increasing complexity are considered for transmitters - common broadcast ( cb ) , superposition coding ( sc ) and dirty paper coding ( dpc ) for the source node alone .",
    "the receiving nodes in the interference network employ multiple access ( mac ) receivers that work by successive interference cancellation .",
    "for different combinations of coding strategies , suitable rate regions are determined for each state ( or interference network ) .",
    "the overall rate achievable from the source to the destination is computed using an optimization over the time - sharing of the rate regions for each state , subject to additional flow constraints that ensure compatibility of the rate vectors used for individual states .    to place our work better",
    ", we review a sample of the relevant prior literature .",
    "the relay channel is a classic setting , introduced in @xcite , and studied extensively @xcite .",
    "one result of particular interest is the cut - set bound for half - duplex relay networks operating by time - sharing over a finite number of states @xcite .",
    "this `` cheap relay '' bound has been used by several authors as an outer bound for achievable rates .",
    "recently , the half - duplex diamond network with two relays has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the _ multi - hopping decode and forward _ ( mdf ) protocol , proposed in @xcite and extended in @xcite , achieves rates close to the cheap relay cut - set bound .",
    "et al _ @xcite consider a modified diamond network with an additional link between the relays and propose a coding strategy using dirty paper coding ( dpc ) , which is shown to approach the cut - set bound .",
    "more protocols for general half - duplex wireless relay networks have been studied in @xcite , @xcite .    in relation to the above , in our work , we propose and study multi - hopping decode and forward ( mdf ) protocols for a general relay network with half - duplex nodes in the following setting : ( 1 ) _ no cooperation _ is assumed for encoding and decoding ( except in one protocol for the source node alone ) , ( 2 ) achievable rates are compared against the cheap relay cut - set bound at _ finite snrs _ , ( 3 ) the protocols and methods apply for a _ general topology _ of relays .",
    "the results are illustrated by evaluation on two different networks , where we show that the cut - set bound is approached for some values of channel gains .",
    "we represent a wireless network with @xmath11 nodes as an undirected graph @xmath12 , where the vertex set @xmath13 represents the wireless nodes .",
    "an edge @xmath14 indicates that node @xmath15 and node @xmath16 are connected by an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel with constant gain denoted as @xmath17 .",
    "each node is subject to an average power constraint @xmath18 and has a noise variance @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , a half - duplex constraint is imposed on the nodes so that they can either transmit , receive , or be idle at any given time .",
    "therefore , in this work , an @xmath11-node half - duplex wireless network can be in @xmath20 states .",
    "these states are denoted @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "in such a network , we are interested in maximizing the communication rate @xmath25 from an arbitrary source @xmath26 to an arbitrary sink @xmath27 .",
    "the nodes in @xmath28 act as relays in this communication .",
    "information flow from source to destination happens by a time - sharing of the states @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and may reach the destination in multiple hops depending on the connectivity of the graph .",
    "hence , the specific problem considered in this work can be termed _",
    "multihop , half - duplex relaying _ in an arbitrary wireless network .",
    "the total transmission time is normalized to one time unit , and state @xmath29 is active for a @xmath31 fraction of the time ( @xmath31 could be zero ) with @xmath32 . as in @xcite , we assume that the state sequence and the time - sharing parameters are known to all nodes before transmission . let @xmath33 be the set of active transmitters in state @xmath29 , and let @xmath34 be the set of active receivers in state @xmath29 .",
    "when state @xmath29 is active , simultaneous transmissions from nodes in @xmath35 can interfere at one or more of the receivers in @xmath36 depending on the connectivity of the nodes in @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "thus , each state @xmath37 is an _ interference network _",
    "@xcite or _ hyperedge _ with @xmath35 and @xmath36 as the two disjoint vertex sets .",
    "we use the terms interference network , hyperedge and state interchangeably .",
    "the choice of a specific coding and decoding strategy for each state @xmath38 determines possible operating rate vectors in an achievable rate region for that state . since the capacity region and optimal coding scheme",
    "are not known for general interference networks , we consider three suboptimal strategies for each state based on different broadcast and interference processing techniques . in all these strategies ,",
    "we impose the constraint that the receivers @xmath36 can not cooperate in decoding .",
    "similarly , the nodes in @xmath35 are assumed to encode their messages independently ; however , in one scheme , the source is assumed to know the messages transmitted by the relays .",
    "a cut - set upper bound for half - duplex relay networks operating by time - sharing over a finite number of states has been derived in @xcite .",
    "this bound is presented here , briefly .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be the transmitted and received variables at node @xmath15 when it is in transmit and receive states , respectively .",
    "the maximum achievable information rate @xmath25 between source @xmath6 and destination @xmath41 in a half - duplex network is bounded as @xmath42 for some joint distributions @xmath43 @xmath44 , where the supremum is over all @xmath45 such that @xmath46 , the minimization is over all @xmath47 such that @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the above upper bound can be computed by solving a linear program @xcite .",
    "the mutual information @xmath53 is computed exactly using known sum rate capacity results @xcite when the choice of @xmath47 and @xmath54 results in multiple access or broadcast channels .",
    "when the sum rate capacity is not known exactly ( e.g. for interference channels ) , the mimo sum capacity is used as an upper bound .",
    "in this section , we present the three mdf strategies that we propose and study in the context of a general relay network with half - duplex nodes . in all these strategies ,",
    "the network operates by time - sharing between the states , where each state is an interference network in general .",
    "the strategies differ in the encoding scheme in each state .",
    "the decoder at each receiver employs successive interference cancellation ( sic ) .      in state @xmath38 , each transmitter @xmath55 sends a common message at rate @xmath56 to the set of all its receivers @xmath57 .",
    "each receiver @xmath58 must decode the messages from the set @xmath59 of all the transmitters connected to @xmath16 .",
    "the decoding constraints at each receiver for achievability are the constraints for the multiple access channel corresponding to the sic receiver .",
    "therefore , the achievable rate region for each state @xmath60 is defined by the following set of constraints : @xmath61 for all @xmath62 and for all @xmath58 . when each transmitter is connected to all receivers , i.e. , @xmath63 for each @xmath64",
    ", then the above region is the same as the compound multiple access rate region in @xcite .      in this scheme , in state @xmath60 , each transmitter @xmath64 sends independent messages to each of its receivers in @xmath57 using superposition coding .",
    "let the codeword transmitted to receiver @xmath16 from transmitter @xmath15 be @xmath65 .",
    "let the power used for this codeword be @xmath66 and @xmath67 be the rate .",
    "therefore , the transmitter @xmath15 transmits a superposition of codewords given by @xmath68 .",
    "the received word at receiver @xmath16 is @xmath69 for simplicity of notation , we assume that the @xmath70 receivers in @xmath57 are arranged in descending order of channel magnitude from transmitter @xmath15 , and @xmath71 $ ] denotes the set of elements of @xmath57 starting from the @xmath72 element to the @xmath73 element .",
    "each receiver @xmath16 decodes the codewords intended for itself and all other _ weaker _ receivers from each transmitter .",
    "let receiver @xmath16 be the @xmath74 receiver in @xmath75 .",
    "the codewords of the weaker receivers @xmath76 $ ] are canceled in the sic receiver .",
    "therefore , only the codewords to the stronger receivers @xmath77 $ ] will interfere .",

    "allows each transmitter to send messages to a subset of its receivers .",
    "this _ receiver selection _ ability allows better spatial reuse .",
    "in the dpc - cb scheme , the source is assumed to know the messages transmitted by all the relays since all messages originate from the source .",
    "therefore , when @xmath82 , dirty paper coding ( dpc ) is used by the source to cancel interference to its receiver caused by simultaneous transmissions from relay nodes . other transmitters in @xmath35 transmit common messages similar to the cb scheme .",
    "the receiver @xmath83 to which the source is sending its dpc - coded message at rate @xmath84 is not affected by interference from other relays and will decode only this message .",
    "the other receivers must decode all the messages from all the transmitters ( except the source ) that are connected to it .",
    "for example , in the state @xmath85 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] , @xmath6 transmits a dpc - coded message to @xmath9 using its prior knowledge of the messages transmitted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( and the corresponding channel gains ) .",
    "receiver @xmath10 decodes the common messages transmitted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and receiver @xmath41 decodes the common message transmitted by @xmath8 . for the above dpc - cb scheme , the achievable rate region for state @xmath60",
    "is given by the following constraints : @xmath86      now , we present the optimization problem to be solved to compute the achievable rate from source @xmath6 to destination @xmath41 in the multistage relay network . the optimization model from @xcite is adapted to incorporate the appropriate rate region constraints for the mdf schemes proposed earlier .",
    "let @xmath87 denote the information flow rate from node @xmath15 to node @xmath16 in state @xmath60 towards the sink .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the total information flow out of node @xmath15 in state @xmath60 .",
    "the optimization problem can be stated as : @xmath89    * flow constraints : for all @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 * scheduling constraints : @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xmath94 . * rate region constraints : the achievable rate region constraints for each state depend on the encoding and decoding scheme used",
    "the rate constraints for each of the three proposed schemes for each state @xmath60 are as follows : 1 .",
    "cb scheme : @xmath95 where rhs of ( [ cbconstraint ] ) is the right hand side of ( [ cbconstraint ] ) .",
    "sc scheme : equation ( [ scconstraint2 ] ) , and : @xmath96 for all @xmath97 and for all @xmath58 .",
    "dpc - cb scheme : @xmath98 for all @xmath62 and for all @xmath99 .    for the cb and dpc - cb schemes , the above optimization problem is a linear program .",
    "however , for the sc scheme , it is not a linear program since the power sharing variables @xmath100 s are also optimized .",
    "therefore , the numerical solutions for the sc scheme are computed using the constrained optimization function _ fmincon _ in matlab .",
    "we evaluate and compare the rate achieved by the mdf schemes : ( 1 ) cb , ( 2 ) sc , and ( 3 ) dpc - cb for two different network topologies and channel realizations . the cheap relay cut - set upper bound for half - duplex relay networks and the rate achieved by the ia scheme",
    "are also evaluated .",
    "the rate achieved by each scheme is obtained by solving the optimization problem in ( [ opt - prob ] ) with appropriate rate region constraints .",
    "since the diamond network has been studied in detail in @xcite , we skip details and simply mention that the proposed mdf protocols recover similar results for the diamond network .",
    "we first consider the two - stage relay network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] . for evaluating the cut - set bound ,",
    "all the @xmath101 states were considered .",
    "the states that avoid interference ( called ia states ) are the states with a single transmitting node . for the proposed mdf protocols , interference network states with two transmitters ( @xmath102 states ) and some states with three transmitters ( 5 out of @xmath103 states )",
    "are used along with the ia states .",
    "two of the states with three transmitters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] for illustration . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnetbeta ] , the cut - set bound , determined by the source cut , is at 1 for all @xmath4 . for large @xmath4 ,",
    "the states used are @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the receivers in both these states see strong interference , which can be canceled at the receiver . for instance , in state @xmath106 , the receiver @xmath7 can decode the source s message in the presence of strong interference from @xmath9 and @xmath8 . because of this , all three mdf schemes achieve capacity of 1 by equal time - sharing of states @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for small @xmath4 , common broadcast at the relays is limited by a weak receiver with close - to - zero capacity .",
    "superposition coding , which enables different rates to receivers , proves to be better at low values of @xmath4 . for sc , states @xmath85 and @xmath108 ( shown in fig . [ fig : lnet ] ) are chosen , and the rate is limited by the interference at relays @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "dpc is marginally weaker , since the relays continue to do common broadcast when the source does dpc .",
    "however , when @xmath109 ( 0 db ) , dpc is better as sc becomes identical to cb for identical channel gains .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnetgamma ] , the cut - set bound , determined by the source cut , is at 1 for all @xmath5 . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the dpc - cb scheme achieves the cut - set bound for lower @xmath5 than sc and cb schemes .",
    "dpc achieves capacity by time - sharing the states @xmath85 and @xmath108 .",
    "the interference at relays @xmath7 and @xmath9 are canceled using dpc , while the interference at @xmath8 and @xmath10 is overcome because the gains of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 links increase with @xmath5 .",
    "the same states are used for the sc scheme as well .",
    "however , interference at @xmath7 and @xmath9 are overcome only for larger @xmath5 .",
    "for very large @xmath5 , cb scheme also approaches the cut - set bound by time - sharing between the states @xmath113 and @xmath114 . for small @xmath5",
    ", we see that dpc - cb achieves a rate of 0.7 , while the sc and cb achieve rates of @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively . for both dpc - cb and cb schemes ,",
    "states @xmath106 and @xmath107 are chosen .",
    "while the interference at @xmath8 and @xmath10 limits the dpc - cb scheme , the cb scheme is limited by the interference at relays @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "consider the @xmath117 rectangular grid network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] .",
    "since the number of possible states is prohibitively large , we first select three non - overlapping paths from the source node @xmath118 to the destination node @xmath119 . we know from the two - stage relay network example that multiple flow paths used appropriately with interference processing can be effective . the paths chosen are @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . using the nodes on these paths , the three states chosen for scheduling are @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 . note that the source node is a transmitter and the destination node is a receiver in all three chosen states .",
    "also , the other two transmitters are chosen to be at different distances from the source . with this choice of states",
    ", we have a two - stage relay network with six relay nodes @xmath126 aiding communications from the source to the destination .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : perfgrid ] , the gains @xmath4 and @xmath5 are set to 1 , and the gain @xmath3 is varied .",
    "we notice that the dpc - cb scheme approaches the capacity for a large range of values of @xmath127 .",
    "the cb and sc schemes are limited by the interference at relays 4 and 5 even for large @xmath3 . for small @xmath3 ,",
    "the dpc - cb and cb schemes are limited by the common broadcast constraint at the relays .",
    "while sc scheme can perform better , it is still limited by interference at relays 4 and 5 compared to the cut - set bound .    in summary , in larger networks",
    ", the choice of schedule is important .",
    "we have used a path - based heuristic and relied on interference - processing for approaching the cut - set bound .",
    "based on this work , two interesting comparisons are possible for multistage half - duplex relay networks based on the cut - set bound . for the network in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] , the cut - set bound evaluates to @xmath128 , which can be interpreted as the capacity of a point - to - point link with power constraint @xmath18 and channel gain @xmath3 . using the protocols in this work",
    ", we have shown that rates up to @xmath129 are achievable by multistage half - duplex relaying in the network of fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] for certain ranges of the channel gains @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a necessary condition for achieving the point - to - point capacity under the half - duplex constraint is that the source needs to be in transmit mode at all times . from our work",
    ", it appears that continuous transmission by the source and information transfer through the half - duplex relays is possible as long as there are two or more non - overlapping paths from the source to the destination ( which is true in figs .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] and [ fig : grid ] ) .",
    "further , coding in interference networks created by multiple transmitters and receivers of the relay network is crucial for enabling the information flow .",
    "the second comparison is with full - duplex relays .",
    "the achievable rate even with full duplex relays is bounded by the sum rate across the source - broadcast cut , which is equal to @xmath129 , for the network in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnet ] . once again",
    ", we observe from our work that two non - overlapping paths through the relays and interference - network coding enable a half - duplex relay network to achieve the full - duplex cut - set bound for certain ranges of channel gains .",
