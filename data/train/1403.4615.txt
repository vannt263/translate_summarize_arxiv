    "adhesion and friction due to capillary forces affect the flow and yield properties of granular materials to a large extent @xcite .",
    "one example is that the strength of powders can be greatly enhanced by absorbing moisture from the ambient atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this fact has been known to our ancient ancestors when they built walls from clay mixed with an appropriate amount of water .",
    "the meniscus formed between clay particles binds them together with capillary forces , increasing the unconfined yield strength of the granular assembly .",
    "the same physics is involved when wet sand is used to build sandcastles , which would not be possible to make with dry sand @xcite .",
    "as dimensions shrink into the nanoscale , capillary forces become increasingly important and can be the dominant source of adhesion between surfaces @xcite .",
    "for example , they often prevent micro / nano - electromechanical systems from functioning under ambient conditions or lead to damage in their fabrication processes @xcite .",
    "they play a major role in nanoscopic sliding friction and lead to a nontrivial velocity dependence of friction @xcite .",
    "many previous experiments also show that when an atomic force microscope ( afm ) , or more generally any small probe , is used to examine a hydrophilic surface in a humid environment , a major contribution to the tip - surface interaction is from the capillary forces associated with the water meniscus bridging the tip and surface @xcite .",
    "the geometry in these experiments can be reasonably approximated as a liquid bridge connecting a spherical tip of certain size and a flat surface .",
    "though there can be complex interplay between the tip shape and capillary forces @xcite , the simple sphere - on - flat geometry serves as a prototype to understand more realistic situations .",
    "these include particle - surface or particle - particle interactions occurring in many physical , chemical , and biological processes @xcite .",
    "a capillary bridge can form either by capillary condensation or by accumulation of liquid @xcite .",
    "the former occurs when multilayer adsorption from a vapor proceeds to the point at which a small gap , such as the one between the tip and sample surfaces , is filled with liquid separated from the vapor phase by menisci @xcite . here",
    "the presence of the surfaces shifts the phase diagram of the fluid to favor the liquid phase @xcite .",
    "capillary condensation is responsible for the formation of water menisci in the afm experiments mentioned above @xcite .",
    "the capillary pressure inside the liquid bridge is fixed by the relative humidity of the vapor phase , and the volume of the liquid bridge depends on the size of the gap .",
    "capillary condensation also occurs in liquid crystals @xcite , aqueous mixtures of polymers @xcite , and model fluid mixtures @xcite when confined in small gaps .",
    "a capillary bridge can also form by accumulation of liquid .",
    "for example , insects excrete fluid to create adhesion that allows them to walk on walls or ceilings . in this case and many other occasions , a nonvolatile liquid is used in order to avoid the quick dry - out of the liquid @xcite . when the liquid only partially wets the solid surfaces , the volume of the liquid bridge is controlled by the amount of liquid injected .",
    "the bridge volume and the wetting properties of the solid surfaces then determine the shape of the liquid bridge and the capillary pressure . in this case",
    "the volume of the liquid bridge acts as a controlling parameter and determines the capillary forces @xcite .    the continuum theory of capillarity , which is briefly introduced in the next section ,",
    "is routinely used to calculate capillary forces and interpret experiments @xcite . however",
    ", it is not obvious if the continuum theory is applicable to liquid bridges with nanometer dimensions . in this paper",
    ", we use md simulations to study the capillary forces produced by a small liquid bridge connecting a spherical tip and a flat substrate .",
    "our goal is to address the fundamental limits of the continuum theory and to develop understanding of new behavior that enters at the nanometer scale .",
    "we find that the interface shape and the interfacial contribution to the capillary force are surprisingly close to continuum theory in all cases .",
    "however the total capillary force is strongly affected by molecular layering and pressure anisotropy when the separation between surfaces is less than a few nanometers .",
