    "vanishing resistance induced by electromagnetic wave excitation in the ultra high - mobility 2-dimensional electron system ( 2des ) , at low temperatures ( @xmath1 ) and modest magnetic fields ( @xmath2 ) , has suggested the possibility of novel non - equilibrium zero - resistance states ( zrs ) in the 2des.@xcite remarkably , in this effect , vanishing resistance does not produce plateaus in the hall resistance , although the diagonal resistance exhibits activated transport and zero - resistance states , similar to quantum hall effects ( qhe).@xcite    a surge in theory has already produced a physical framework for viewing this extraordinary phenomenon , with testable predictions for further experiment.@xcite a class of hypothesis attributes radiation induced resistance oscillations to @xmath2-dependent enhancement / reduction of the current.@xcite an oscillatory density - of - states , an electric field , and impurity scattering appear to be the key ingredients in theory , which indicates negative resistivity for sufficiently large radiation intensities.@xcite the modeling by durst and co - workers,@xcite which is similar to the work by ryzhii,@xcite reproduced the period and , approximately , the phase reported in ref.1,@xcite although there was variance between theory and experiment so far as the realization of negative resistivity was concerned.@xcite a possible physical instability for a negative resistivity state , meanwhile , led to the conjecture by andreev _",
    "_ of a current dependent resistivity , and the formation of current domains , along with a scenario for realizing zero - resistance in measurement.@xcite these works taken together seem to provide a path for realizing radiation - induced oscillatory magnetoresistance and zero - resistance.@xcite yet , there do occur real differences between the theoretical modeling and experiment .",
    "for example , the type of scattering potential invoked in the durst _",
    "_ theory differs from the experimental situation , where measurements involve low - disorder , extremely high mobility specimens including mostly small angle scattering.@xcite in addition , the current domain picture of andreev _ et al .",
    "_ includes boundary conditions,@xcite which appear difficult to realize in the hall bar type specimen.@xcite    a complementary approach,@xcite which modeled the specimen as a tunnel junction , also realized magnetoresistance oscillations with a period and phase that were approximately consistent with ref .",
    "1.@xcite this theory indicated , in addition , an n - shape current - voltage ( @xmath3 ) characteristic in a regime of radiation - induced negative conductivity , analogous to andreev _",
    "et al_.@xcite subsequent theoretical work by bergeret , huckestein , and volkov provided clarification and proposed , in the strong @xmath2-field limit , an s - shape @xmath3 characteristic for hall bar devices and a n - shape @xmath3 characteristic for the corbino device,@xcite the geometry dependence following from the boundary conditions in the 2des .",
    "these works impressed the idea that @xmath3 characteristics of the zrs , which appear calculable from theory , might serve as an incisive and confirming probe of the underlying physics .",
    "in short , the possible transformation of a predicted negative resistivity / conductivity state , into the vanishing resistance state reported by experiment , in a strong b - field limit where vanishing resistance and vanishing conductance are equivalent , and the associated @xmath3 characteristics , appear to be issues in the theoretical discussion.@xcite    in comparison , experiment indicates a zrs which is approached exponentially vs. @xmath1 , following @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an activation energy.@xcite by invoking an analogy to qhe , where large amplitude ( shubnikov - de haas ) resistance oscillations show similar zrs while exhibiting activated transport,@xcite such transport behavior has been cited as evidence for a radiation - induced gap in the electronic spectrum.@xcite    shi and xie have argued that a negative conductance instability could induce a state transition and a new electronic phase , which includes a physical rearrangement of the system.@xcite it appears that this possibility could also be addressed by comparing experiment with model predictions.@xcite thus , we examine the radiation induced vanishing resistance states and associated voltage - current ( @xmath0 ) characteristics in ultra high mobility gaas / algaas heterostructures . in a hall geometry , we demonstrate that the non - linear @xmath0 curve at @xmath6 in the absence of radiation becomes linearized as @xmath7 @xmath8 0 under the influence of radiation , to relatively high currents . the power variation of @xmath7 at the minima is also reported and these data suggest that a variable such as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the radiation power , might play a role that is approximately analogous to the inverse temperature in activation studies .",
    "the observed differences between experiment and available model predictions seem to suggest that additional physics might be involved in the zrs that is observed in the irradiated-2des .",
    "experiments were carried out on hall bars , square shaped devices , and corbino rings , fabricated from gaas / algaas heterostructures . after a brief illumination by a red led , the best material was typically characterized by an electron density , @xmath11 k ) @xmath12 @xmath13 , and an electron mobility @xmath14 k ) upto @xmath15 @xmath16 v s. low frequency lock - in based electrical measurements were carried out with the sample mounted inside a waveguide and immersed in pumped liquid he-3 , over the @xmath1-range @xmath17 k. lock - in based @xmath18 measurements were carried out by quasi - statically ramping the excitation voltage in the ac constant - current circuit .",
    "electromagnetic ( em ) waves in the microwave part of the spectrum , @xmath19 ghz , were generated using various tunable sources .",
    "the radiation intensity was set at the source and subsequently reduced using variable attenuators for the reported experiments at @xmath20 ghz , where the power in the vicinity of the sample is estimated to be less than @xmath21 mw .",
    "measurements at @xmath22 ghz were carried out using a signal generator with calibrated output power.@xcite thus , the source output power at @xmath22 ghz is given in absolute units .",
    "1 shows the magnetoresistance measured with ( w/ ) and without ( w / o ) electromagnetic wave excitation for @xmath23 tesla .",

    "1(b ) , the data of fig .",
    "1(a ) have been plotted as a function of the normalized inverse magnetic field , where the normalization factor , @xmath37 , is the period in @xmath38 of the radiation - induced resistance oscillations.@xcite fig .",
    "1(b ) indicates that the photoexcited ( w / radiation ) data cross the dark ( w / o radiation ) data at integral and half - integral values of the @xmath39 , when @xmath40 ( see also fig .",
    "3(a ) of ref . 1 ) . at these @xmath39 ,",
    "the photon energy @xmath41 spans an integral , @xmath34 , or half integral , @xmath42 , cyclotron energies .",
    "the crossing feature in the vicinity of integral @xmath39 appears to be in agreement with the theoretical prediction.@xcite shi and xie have suggested that , when @xmath43 , the conductivity in the presence of radiation , @xmath44 , equals the conductivity in the absence of radiation , @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46.@xcite remarkably , the data suggest the same behavior at @xmath42 . the data of fig .",
    "1(b ) also show that resistance minima occur about @xmath47 , while higher order resistance maxima occur about @xmath48 .",
    "experiment suggests that the resistance maxima generally obey this rule for integral @xmath34 , excepting @xmath49 , where phase distortion associated with the last peak seems to shift it from the @xmath50 to approximately @xmath51 ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) ) .    in order to compare the relative phases of radiation - induced resistance oscillations and the sdh effect ,",

    "thus , there appears to be a phase difference between the observed oscillations @xmath57 and the assumed form for the density - of - states ( dos ) @xmath58 of ref .",
    "8 , which is attributed here to the suppression of the zero - point energy shift , @xmath59 , by theory.@xcite if this physically manifested constant energy shift @xmath59 is included in @xmath60 , then the dos at low-@xmath2 looks like @xmath61 , with @xmath62 positive . unlike sdh oscillations , the radiation induced oscillations exhibit minima for @xmath39 about @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) .",
    "results of @xmath0 studies in the vicinity of the @xmath64 resistance minimum , at the @xmath2-value marked by the star in fig .",
    "1(a ) , are summarized in fig .",
    "2(a ) shows @xmath65 vs. @xmath66 to @xmath67 @xmath68a for several power attenuation factors . in the absence of radiation ( @xmath69 db ) ,",
    "@xmath65 vs. @xmath66 is initially ohmic at low currents ( @xmath70 @xmath68a ) , before non - linearity , possibly due to heating , becomes apparent above @xmath71 @xmath68a .",
    "the application of radiation leads to a progressive reduction in the initial slope of the @xmath65 vs. @xmath66 curves , signifying a decrease in @xmath7 in the vicinity of @xmath64 under photoexcitation .",
    "the data suggest , in addition , that the onset of non - linearity shifts to higher current with increasing radiation intensity .",
    "this feature implies that the initial linear region observed in the absence of radiation is extended to higher currents under the influence of radiation .",
    "if the observed non - linearity originates from heating , then its shift to higher currents under radiation implies also that heating effects are reduced under photoexcitation , over the resistance minima .",
    "experimental results to higher currents shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) confirm the features observed in fig .",
    "2(a ) . here , the data indicate a negative differential resistance @xmath72 above @xmath73 @xmath68a in the absence of radiation ( @xmath69 db ) , while @xmath74 with microwave excitation ( @xmath75 db ) for the entire range of currents .",
    "notably , non - linearity in the @xmath0 curve under radiation , if any , appears only above @xmath22 @xmath68a , although the hall voltage @xmath76 @xmath68a ) @xmath77 mv exceeds the landau level spacing @xmath78 mv by nearly an order of magnitude even at @xmath67 @xmath68a , i.e. , @xmath76 @xmath68a ) @xmath79 .",
    "an investigation of the resistance in a corbino geometry specimen at @xmath6 and @xmath80 under microwave excitation also showed current - independent characteristics over the investigated range , similar to what has been shown for a hall geometry in fig .",
    "3 of ref . 1 . in the corbino configuration , a maximum in the resistance ( or a minimum in the conductance ) was observed at @xmath6 and @xmath80 , supplementing the usual result for the hall configuration .",
    "the difference was attributed to the well - known feature of transport , that the corbino resistance @xmath81 while the diagonal resistance in a hall geometry @xmath82 under the @xmath83 condition .",
    "here , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the diagonal and off - diagonal components of the conductivity tensor .    the observed change in the @xmath0 characteristics with the radiation intensity in fig .",
    "2(a ) appears , as mentioned before , closely correlated to the radiation - induced modification of the diagonal resistance at the resistance minima .",
    "experiments show that , at a constant temperature , the resistance minima become deeper with increasing radiation intensity , until the onset of `` breakdown.''@xcite on the other hand , at constant radiation intensity , the resistance shows activated transport characteristics as a function of the temperature.@xcite thus , intuitively , it appears that reducing the temperature and increasing the radiation intensity play a similar role in the phenomenology .",
    "but the connections are not well understood and , therefore , the effect of radiation at the deepest resistance minima is further examined here .",
    "the effect of radiation intensity at the higher order @xmath7 minima have been reported elsewhere.@xcite    thus , @xmath7 evaluated from the initial slope of the @xmath0 data of fig .",
    "2(a ) have been shown in fig .",
    "2 ( c ) as a function of @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the ( constant ) output power of the radiation source , and @xmath10 is the attenuated power .",
    "this data plot shows a constant resistance between @xmath69 db and @xmath88 db , followed by a rapid decrease at higher power levels ( @xmath89 db ) ; the resistance becomes small on the exhibited scale above @xmath90 db .",
    "2(d ) shows an alternate plot with the natural logarithm of the resistance on the ordinate vs. the normalized power on a linear scale along the abscissa .",
    "this figure suggests that , for @xmath91 , @xmath92 $ ] , with @xmath93 12 .",
    "further measurements addressing this issue are illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . here , vanishing resistance is observable with a source power of @xmath94 @xmath95 about @xmath96 .",
    "other features such as resistance minima near @xmath97^{-1}$ ] , resistance maxima near @xmath98^{-1}$ ] for @xmath99 , nodes in the resistance in the vicinity of @xmath34 and @xmath100 , and the intersection of the data curves obtained at different powers in the vicinity of the nodes , are consistent with the results shown for @xmath101 ghz in fig .",
    "note also that the first resistance maximum occurs in the vicinity of @xmath102 .",
    "that is , this resistance maximum occurs slightly below @xmath103 , implying a magnetic field for this feature that is slightly above @xmath104 .",
    "the power dependence of the resistance at the @xmath105 and @xmath106 minima , and the @xmath107 and @xmath108 maxima are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) and in fig .",
    "3(b ) . in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the ordinate shows @xmath109 , while the abscissa shows @xmath110 .",
    "remarkably , the plot shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) looks very similar to the activation plots,@xcite which suggests that the logarithm of the radiation power might play a role in power dependent studies that is analogous to the inverse temperature in activation studies , at least at the @xmath105 and @xmath106 minima .",
    "the voltage - current characteristics in the regime of the radiation induced zero - resistance states could serve to provide valuable understanding into the physical mechanism underlying the phenomenon since such characteristics can be measured through experiment and , at the same time , they appear calculable from existing theory,@xcite which facilitates a comparison between experiment and theory .    at the present , it is believed that there ought to be either a threshold electric field for the onset of current in a corbino geometry or a threshold current density for the onset of dissipation in a hall geometry.@xcite thus , the naive expectation has been that a linear voltage - current characteristic in the absence of radiation should be transformed into a non - linear characteristic under the influence of radiation .",
    "theoretical expectations for a non - linear voltage - current characteristic under photoexcitation are motivated as follows : as the amplitude of the radiation induced resistivity / conductivity oscillations increases with increasing radiation intensity , the oscillatory minima approach and then , in principle , cross over into a negative conductivity / resistivity regime.@xcite however , the physical instability of negative resistivity / conductivity prevents the actual observation of negative resistance / conductance .",
    "it leads instead to a locking of the measured resistance / conductance at zero - resistance / conductance , along with a stratification of current into two oppositely directed current domains.@xcite as these current domains are thought to be characterized by an unspecified current density @xmath111 , the domains are expected to rearrange themselves and carry an applied current in a hall device without dissipation , so long as the current density associated with the applied current does not exceed approximately @xmath111/2 .",
    "thus , vanishing @xmath65 should be observed below some critical applied current in a hall geometry . above the critical current ,",
    "however , there should then be a tendency to destroy the zero - resistance state as the domains are unable to accommodate the applied current , and a non - linear voltage - current characteristic is supposed to reveal such a breakdown of the radiation induced zero - resistance states with increasing current .",
    "the experimental results for the hall geometry shown in fig .",
    "2 appear , however , quite unlike expectations : the voltage - current characteristic is non - linear in the absence of radiation and it becomes linearized under the application of radiation . here",
    ", an unexpected result seems to be the non - linearity and the negative differential resistance in the absence of radiation in the high mobility specimen , and the suppression of this non - linearity by the radiation .",
    "an important supplementary feature of experiment is that , at the oscillatory resistance minima , there is an activated - type temperature dependence of the resistance.@xcite the results reported here seem to suggest that , in addition to the activated temperature dependence at the minima , the voltage - current characteristics constitute yet another thought provoking problem in this field .",
    "the reported voltage - current characteristics , when coupled with the activated temperature resistance at the minima , seem to leave open the possibility that the observed zero - resistance states might be a consequence of a vanishing bulk diagonal resistivity , similar to the quantum hall situation .",
    "that is , it could be that the diagonal resistance saturates at zero - resistance in activated fashion under photo - excitation because the diagonal resistivity approaches zero - resistivity in a similar way .",
    "further experiments seem necessary , however , to clarify this point .",
    "in summary , we have examined the voltage - current characteristics and the role of the microwave power in the novel radiation induced zero - resistance states in the high mobility 2des .",
    "the @xmath0 measurement suggest a linearization of the device characteristics with the application of radiation , while the power dependence at the minima suggest that the logarithm of the radiation intensity might play a role that is similar to the inverse temperature in activation studies . to our knowledge",
    ", these features have not been predicted by theory and , therefore , they seem to provide further motivation for the study- of this remarkable new effect.@xcite                                                                            r. g. mani _ et al_. , in _ proceedings of the 26th international conference on the physics of semiconductors , 29 july - 2 august 2002 , edinburgh , scotland _ , iop conference series vol .",
