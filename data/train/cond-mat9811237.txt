    "brownian motion is one of the fundamental processes in nature . originally observed in the irregular motion of pollen grains by the botanist brown@xcite , and cast into the language of the diffusion equation by einstein@xcite , it has now been applied , in the mathematical framework of random walks@xcite , to an enormous variety of processes in the physical sciences and beyond .",
    "a very rich field of research has been built up around the behavior of a random walk coupled to a disordered environment@xcite , a good example being the anomalous diffusion of electrons in a disordered medium@xcite .",
    "also , one can consider a random walker _",
    "being _ the disordering agent in its environment .",
    "applications of the latter include the tagged diffusion of atoms in a crystal@xcite , or magnetic disordering due to a wandering vacancy@xcite .    in this paper we will introduce a particularly simple example of an active random walker ( or brownian agent ) disordering its environment .",
    "although the model is interesting in its own right , we believe it will have a useful application to the study of data corruption in ultra - small storage devices . before pursuing this connection , we shall briefly describe the model ( which will be more carefully defined in the next section ) .",
    "the two main features of the model are first , the brownian agent ( ba ) performs a pure random walk ",
    "it is not affected by the environment in any way .",
    "second , the environment is bistable .",
    "that is to say , it is composed of elements which may only exist in one of two possible states ( see ref.@xcite for a loosely related random walk process ) .",
    "thus we can consider the environment to be composed of binary data ( our favored realization ) , magnetic spins , chemical species a and b , and so on . as the ba wanders through the environment it has a certain probability to switch the value of an element in its immediate vicinity .",
    "thus , if we start with a system in which all elements exist in the same state ( ` up ' say ) , and introduce the ba at the origin , then after some time , there will be a region around the origin in which the elements will be found in a mixture of ` up ' and ` down ' states .",
    "naturally , the linear size of the region will grow on average as @xmath4 .",
    "the more subtle question concerns the degree of disordering which exists for elements within this region , and also their spatial correlations .. as we shall see , the statistics of the disordered elements are very rich .",
    "this is most convincingly demonstrated by the dominance of extreme fluctuations ; for instance , the distribution of disordered elements is log - normal .",
    "thus , typical and average events are quite distinct , and become ever more so as time proceeds .    before giving an outline of the paper",
    "we shall say a few words about the potential relevance of this system to data corruption . with the advent of semiconductor memories ( for dynamic random access memories ( dram s ) and various types of read only memories ( rom s ) ) , there has been a tremendous drive within the semiconductor industry to produce ever - smaller memory devices@xcite .",
    "there are many properties ( _ e.g. _ stability , power consumption , volatility , and cost ) which must be balanced in the design of such devices .",
    "these factors determine the type of material used , and the geometry , dimension and architecture of the device .",
    "( for instance , three dimensional arrays have a very efficient address structure , and are stable against interference from bombarding alpha particles , but are very expensive to produce@xcite . )",
    "one of the main issues is the stability , or reliability , of the device . in semiconductor memories , there are many physical effects which can create hard errors ( destruction or corruption of the device itself ) or soft errors ( corruption of the data stored in the device ) . in the latter category ,",
    "the most common problems originate from electron clouds caused by alpha particles , but soft errors may also arise from electromigration and charge diffusion@xcite .",
    "the key point is that different corruption mechanisms operate on different time scales ( leading to the famous bath - tub curve of device reliability@xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore important to know on what time - scales one should expect significant corruption from a given process .",
    "the model we propose here ( namely data corruption via a ba ) is probably not relevant for today s semiconductor devices , since there are so many ` mesoscopic ' processes occurring on the level of a flip - flop , that subtle correlations due to a ba will be washed out .",
    "however , we can look ahead to the new generation of ( quantum ) storage devices , in which a single electron ( controlled in a gate via coulomb blockade ) can store one bit of data . in this case",
    ", a microscopic ba may indeed play an important role in data corruption , and it will be necessary to understand its time - scales and efficacy of operation , so that we can minimize its influence .",
    "this paper constitutes a first step towards gaining such an understanding .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we shall carefully define the model ( using discrete space and time ) within the master equation formulation of stochastic processes .",
    "we shall derive some general statistical properties of the process , but we shall not enter into any explicit calculations .",
    "this is deferred to sections iii - v in which we introduce a very simple continuum theory for the process , which is motivated by viewing the process as a stochastic cellular automaton . in section",
    "iii we derive this continuum theory and , using the complementary descriptions of quantum mechanics ( _ i.e. _ the schrdinger equation and the feynman path integral ) , we shall demonstrate its equivalence to the master equation formulation of section ii .",
    "we then examine the case of one spatial dimension in section iv .",
    "the model is tractable , and a great deal of information may be derived concerning the mean density of disordered elements , their spatial correlations , and finally their entire distribution function . in section",
    "v , we briefly study higher dimensions , and derive some general statistical properties for the process , for an arbitrary spatial coupling between the ba and its environment .",
    "we also derive an expression for the mean density of disordered elements in two dimensions . in section",
    "vi we present results from extensive numerical simulations of the discrete process . in all cases ,",
    "we find good agreement between the simulation results and the predictions of the continuum theory .",
    "we end the paper with a summary of the work , and some ideas for future study .",
    "we consider binary data bits on a @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice . for convenience we shall represent each bit by an ising spin @xmath5 , where the index @xmath6 represents a discrete lattice vector .",
    "the spin takes the value @xmath7 for a data bit which is uncorrupted ( corrupted ) .",
    "thus , the initial configuration is a lattice of spins , all of which take the value @xmath8 . [ we prefer to describe the system almost exclusively in terms of the spin variables",
    ". thus we shall use phrases such as ` magnetization density ' , or ` global magnetization ' .",
    "the translation of these quantities to the corresponding properties for corrupted data bits is immediate as one only need replace @xmath5 by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the presence ( with value unity ) or absence ( with value zero ) of a corrupted bit . similarly , we shall often refer to the average magnetization density @xmath11 , which is related to the average density of corrupted bits @xmath12 via @xmath13 .",
    "] we denote the position of the ba by the lattice vector @xmath14 .",
    "each time step , the ba has a probability @xmath15 to make a jump to one of its ( @xmath16 ) nearest neighbors . for the sake of generality , we will not insist that the ba always flips a spin ( _ i.e. _ changes a data bit ) as it moves .",
    "thus , on a given jump , we allow the ba to flip the spin at the site it is leaving , with a probability @xmath17 . in this section",
    "we shall describe the process via a master equation@xcite .",
    "namely , we shall define the dynamics through the evolution of the distribution @xmath18 , which is the probability that at time @xmath19 the ba is at position @xmath14 , and the spins have configuration @xmath20 .",
    "given the above rules , the master equation takes the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 represent the @xmath16 orthogonal lattice vectors ( which have magnitude @xmath23 ) .",
    "the natural quantities to extract from the distribution @xmath24 are conditional averages .",
    "the simplest is the mean value of the spin at position @xmath25 at time @xmath19 , given the ba is at position @xmath14 .",
    "this is defined via @xmath26 higher order conditional averages may be defined accordingly . performing the spin trace over the master equation with a weight of @xmath5 yields @xmath27\\\\ & - & { pq\\over d } \\",
    "\\theta ( { \\bf r},t \\ | \\ { \\bf r } )   \\sum \\limits _ { \\bf l } \\delta _ { { \\bf r } , { \\bf r}+{\\bf l } } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equation has a physically appealing form .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath28 has two contributions .",
    "the first is lattice diffusion , as given by the first sum on the r.h.s .",
    "the second contribution vanishes unless the spin in question is in the immediate vicinity of the ba , in which case it acts as a sink .    at this point in the discussion it is worthwhile to consider the continuum limit .",
    "namely we take the time scale @xmath29 and the lattice scale @xmath23 to zero , and define a diffusion constant @xmath30 .",
    "we also introduce a coupling @xmath31 . then replacing the kronecker @xmath32-function in eq.([lomageq ] ) by a dirac @xmath32-function",
    "we find @xmath33 it is important to note that this continuum equation is not strictly derived from eq.([lomageq ] ) , as we have not proved that the continuum limit exists .",
    "in fact , we shall find that for @xmath34 , the lattice scale @xmath23 is crucial , and consequently we must soften the dirac @xmath32-function to a function @xmath35 which is sharply peaked ( over a linear scale @xmath23 ) with unit integral over @xmath36 .",
    "one actually expects this to be the case , as eq.([lomco ] ) is the imaginary - time schrdinger equation for a particle under the influence of a repulsive @xmath37-function potential .",
    "[ note the independent spatial variable in this quantum system is @xmath14 , with the variable @xmath6 simply labelling the position of the potential . ]",
    "it is well known@xcite that the repulsive @xmath32-function potential is ` invisible ' to the particle for @xmath34 , and one usually cures this by smearing the potential just as described above .",
    "the quantum mechanics analogy will prove useful in the next section when we construct an alternative continuum model .    before leaving this section we shall indicate the derivation of a non - trivial statistical relation hidden inside eq.([lomageq ] ) .",
    "first , we must define the initial condition . as mentioned before , given that up - spins denote uncorrupted data , the initial value of each spin is @xmath8 .",
    "there is a slight subtlety of definition regarding the value of the spin at the site where the ba is initially planted .",
    "( this position shall be taken to be the origin , without any loss of generality . )",
    "we shall take this spin to be initially @xmath38 so that immediately after the ba has moved away the spin at the origin has value @xmath8 .",
    "thus we have @xmath39 and consequently , @xmath40    we may obtain the following two averages from @xmath41 .",
    "the first is the average value of the spin at the origin .",
    "this is simply given by @xmath42 .",
    "the second average is the quantity @xmath43 , which corresponds to averaging the value of the spin at the site where the ba happens to be at time @xmath19 .",
    "one can prove that @xmath44 for all @xmath19 .",
    "we arrive at the above result by essentially solving the partial difference equation ( [ lomageq ] ) using discrete fourier and laplace transforms .",
    "the details can be found in appendix a.    this result is useful for proving a more physically relevant relation .",
    "let us denote the average global magnetization by @xmath45 \\ , \\ ] ] where we have defined it relative to the ( infinite ) initial magnetization .",
    "this quantity essentially measures the average of the total number of corrupted bits ( up to a factor of 2 ) . summing eq.([lomageq ] ) over @xmath6 and @xmath14 gives @xmath46 then using ( [ iden ] ) we can rewrite the above relation in the form @xmath47 in other words , the rate of change of the mean global magnetization is proportional to the mean magnetization density at the origin .",
    "this is a non - trivial relation between a global and a local quantity .    in principle",
    ", one can obtain exact results for many interesting quantities ( like the mean magnetization density , or correlation functions ) by directly solving for the conditional averages , as illustrated in appendix a. however , we prefer to obtain results from a continuum theory ; partly because the calculations are a little easier , but more importantly because we can access more sophisticated properties of the system , such as the probability distribution of the coarse - grained magnetization density .",
    "in this section we shall motivate a particularly simple continuum description of the data corruption process , and show its equivalence to the discrete theory of the previous section .",
    "there is an alternative method of characterizing the evolution of the system , other than using the evolution of the probability distribution @xmath18 via the master equation .",
    "this method consists of writing the local rules for the process in the spirit of a stochastic cellular automaton ( sca)@xcite . let us focus on the case that at each time step the ba makes a random jump to one of its nearest neighbors , and that the spin at the site which it leaves behind , definitely flips .",
    "this corresponds to setting @xmath48 .",
    "the local rules for such a process are easily written down .",
    "let us denote the time - dependent position of the ba by @xmath49 , a randomly chosen unit lattice vector by @xmath50 , and the time - dependent value of the spin at site @xmath6 by @xmath51 .",
    "then we have @xmath52    we are interested in a continuum limit of these two rules .",
    "the first is nothing more than a random walk .",
    "we take the lattice vector @xmath49 to be a continuum vector ( _ i.e. _ each of the @xmath0 components is a real number ) , and we replace the random unit lattice vector @xmath50 by a continuum vector @xmath53 , each component of which is a uncorrelated gaussian random variable with zero mean ( _ i.e. _ @xmath54 is a white noise process ) .",
    "the correlator of @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where here and henceforth , angled brackets indicate an average over the noise ( or equivalently the paths of the ba ) .",
    "then , on taking @xmath57 , eq.([scadis1 ] ) assumes the form @xmath58 which is the familiar equation for a continuum random walker where @xmath59 is the diffusion constant@xcite .",
    "the second sca rule is more complicated to generalize to the continuum . as a first step",
    "let us define a coarse - grained magnetization density @xmath60 in the following way .",
    "we imagine defining a large region around the lattice site @xmath6 and summing all the spins in that region .",
    "their sum ( suitably normalized ) constitutes @xmath60 , with the label @xmath6 denoting a point in the @xmath36 continuum .",
    "an entirely analogous procedure is used in motivating the landau - wilson free energy functional from the ising model of ferromagnetism@xcite .",
    "the difficulty in our case is that we can not derive a closed equation for @xmath61 from the discrete rule ( [ scadis2 ] ) .",
    "we therefore make the following approximation . splitting the r.h.s . of ( [ scadis2 ] ) into two pieces , we see that the first may be taken over to the l.h.s . which may then be taken to be a time derivative in the limit of @xmath57 .",
    "the second piece resembles a decay term centered at @xmath62 .",
    "so , we postulate that the coarse - grained magnetization density satisfies @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a phenomenological parameter which describes how strongly the magnetization density is coupled to the ba .",
    "we stress that the field @xmath60 is a function of the continuous space and time variables @xmath6 and @xmath19 , and a _ functional _ of the path @xmath49 of the ba .",
    "now , the above heuristic derivation of the continuum theory was based on a sca for the case in which the ba always moves ( @xmath65 ) , and for which the spin located at the previous ba position is always flipped ( @xmath66 ) . in general @xmath15 and @xmath17 are both less than unity .",
    "intuitively we expect a very simple renormalization of our phenomenological parameters as @xmath15 and @xmath17 are changed . the diffusion constant @xmath59 should be proportional to @xmath15 , and the strength of the spin - ba coupling @xmath64 should be proportional to both @xmath15 and , more importantly , @xmath17 .",
    "thus we see a very close correspondence between @xmath59 and @xmath64 in the current continuum theory , and the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 which were introduced in the continuum limit ( [ lomco ] ) of the discrete equation ( [ lomageq ] ) .",
    "in fact they are identical , as will emerge in the following discussion .",
    "one of the positive features of the continuum theory as described by ( [ scacont2 ] ) is that one may immediately integrate the equation to find the magnetization density as an explicit functional of the path of the ba . as an initial condition",
    "we take @xmath69 for all @xmath6 .",
    "the subtlety encountered in the discrete theory concerning the initial value of the spin at the origin disappears here since the coarse grained function @xmath61 is not sensitive to the value of one inverted spin .",
    "straightforward integration of ( [ scacont2 ] ) yields @xmath70 \\ .\\ ] ] it is important to note at this stage that the magnetization density @xmath61 is clearly positive for all @xmath6 and @xmath19 . therefore within our continuum formulation , we have ignored paths of the ba which create large patches containing a majority of down spins ( _ i.e. _ corrupted bits ) .",
    "such patches will occur , but their frequency of occurrence is certainly very small since the system starts in a completely uncorrupted state .",
    "for instance , the probability for the ba to create a purely negative domain of @xmath71 spins is of the order @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , so long as we coarse - grain the original spin model over a sufficiently large scale , we can be confident that the most important configurations have been retained in the continuum theory .",
    "ultimately , one must justify such an approximation _ a posteriori _ by comparison with either results from the discrete theory , or from numerical simulations .",
    "as we shall see , both of these support the current continuum model and the approximations contained therein .",
    "we shall now connect the continuum theory as given by ( [ solcon ] ) , and the continuum limit ( [ lomco ] ) of the discrete theory , as given by ( [ lomageq ] ) .",
    "the mean magnetization density in the discrete theory is given by @xmath73 where in the continuum limit , we have replaced the sum over ba positions by an integral , and the field @xmath28 satisfies the imaginary - time schrdinger equation as given in ( [ lomco ] ) . in the alternative continuum theory",
    ", we can find the mean magnetization density by averaging the coarse - grained density @xmath74 over all paths @xmath49 .",
    "each path is weighted by a gaussian factor @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a normalization factor .",
    "therefore we can write the average of @xmath61 as a functional integral @xmath77 \\right \\rbrace \\ , \\\\ & = & { \\cal n } \\int d^{d}r_{f } \\int \\limits ^{{\\bf r}_{f } } { \\cal d}{\\bf r}(t ' ) \\   { \\rm exp } \\left \\lbrace   - \\int \\limits _ { 0}^{t } dt '",
    "\\ \\left [ { 1\\over 2d ' } \\left ( { d{\\bf r}\\over dt ' } \\right ) ^{2 }   + \\lambda ' \\delta ^{d } ( { \\bf r}-{\\bf r}(t ' ) ) \\right ] \\right \\rbrace \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used ( [ solcon ] ) in going from the first line to the second , and we have introduced the final position of the ba ( _ i.e. _ * r*(t ) ) as a free integration variable @xmath78 in rewriting the second line as the third .",
    "the reason for this cosmetic change is to make explicit the fact that @xmath79 can be expressed as a spatial integral over the final ba position , where the integrand is itself a path integral over ba trajectories .",
    "this path integral is nothing more than a re - expression of the solution of an imaginary time schrdinger equation ( using the well - known feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics@xcite ) for a particle in a repulsive @xmath32-function potential .",
    "we can now see the connection : eq .",
    "( [ mmd2 ] ) is an exact restatement of eqs .",
    "( [ lomco ] ) and ( [ mmd1 ] ) , with the identification @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "[ so , henceforth we shall drop the primes in the material parameters . ] to summarize , by utilizing the complementary formulations of quantum mechanics via the schrdinger equation and the feynman path integral , we have shown that the continuum limit of the master equation is identical to the continuum theory constructed at the beginning of this section .",
    "two final points are in order .",
    "first , as noted in the previous section , the @xmath32-function potential must be replaced by a smeared function @xmath35 for @xmath34 ; thus in our continuum theory encapsulated in eq.([scacont2 ] ) , we shall make a similar replacement when studying two or higher dimensions .",
    "second , we have established a connection between the master equation and eq.([scacont2 ] ) only at the level of the first moment .",
    "it is straightforward to extend each formulation to higher order correlation functions , and indeed one finds an exact correspondence .",
    "for instance , we can define the conditional spin - spin correlation function within the discrete theory @xmath82 using the master equation one can show that in the continuum limit this function satisfies the schrdinger equation for a particle under the influence of two repulsive @xmath37-function potentials located at @xmath25 and @xmath83 . similarly , we can construct the coarse - grained two - point correlation function from eq.([solcon ] ) by evaluating @xmath84 .",
    "it is easy to see that this quantity is given by an integral over the analogous path - integral for two repulsive @xmath32-function potentials .",
    "having completed our formulation of a simple continuum theory , and shown its equivalence to the continuum limit of the master equation , we shall proceed to the next section in which we present a comprehensive solution of the model in one dimension .",
    "in this section we restrict ourselves to one dimension .",
    "this does not necessarily mean a single chain of sites .",
    "rather , we shall exclusively study the continuum theory of the last section , and in this case , for large enough times , @xmath3 refers to any system which has an infinite longitudinal dimension , and finite transverse dimensions ( for instance an infinitely long strip ) .",
    "this is the case , since as time proceeds , the correlation length will eventually become greater than the transverse size of the system , thereby only allowing the longitudinal fluctuations to continue growing , as is the case in a strictly one - dimensional system .",
    "the continuum model described in the previous section can be viewed as a ` non - conserved ' cousin of the continuum theory of vacancy mediated diffusion ( a process which in the spin language conserves magnetization ) introduced recently@xcite .",
    "an exact analysis of the latter theory was possible using infinite order perturbation theory in the spin - ba coupling @xmath68 .",
    "we shall use the same technique here , as it leads rather directly to a full solution .",
    "alternatively , one may solve the schrdinger equation for the conditional averages . however , there are some important quantities ( like the distribution of the magnetization density ) which can not be easily recovered from the latter approach .    our starting point is the integrated solution of the continuum formulation as given in eq.([solcon ] ) .",
    "first , we shall derive an expression for the magnetization density @xmath85 . performing a direct average of eq.([solcon ] ) and expanding in powers of @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 , and for @xmath89 @xmath90^{n } \\right \\rangle \\ .\\ ] ] we refer the reader to appendix b in which the above average is explicitly calculated .",
    "the result is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the probability density of the ba .",
    "the structure of eq.([solchi ] ) is that of an @xmath93-fold convolution , so we may utilize a laplace transform to good effect .",

    "the case of @xmath34 is more complicated as the function @xmath97 is no longer integrable .",
    "this expression for the laplace transform of @xmath11 is exact .",
    "this will prove to be important when we come to evaluate the distribution function of @xmath98 .",

    "there is no simple ( i.e. single length ) scaling form for @xmath85 .",
    "next we consider the continuum analogues of eqs.([iden])-([glomag3 ] ) .",
    "we define the average global magnetization ( relative to its initial value ) as @xmath109 \\ , \\ ] ] which may be compared to the discrete version in eq.([glomag ] ) . integrating and averaging the continuum model ( [ scacont2 ] ) yields @xmath110 which is to be compared with eq.([glomag2 ] ) .",
    "this last equation indicates that we may explicitly find an expression for @xmath111 by calculating the time derivative of the spatial integral of @xmath112 .",
    "this may be done at the level of the perturbation series ( [ avden ] ) , from which one may show that the following relation holds exactly , for all times : @xmath113 which is the continuum analogue of eq.([iden ] ) .",
    "finally , combining eqs.([glomagc2 ] ) and ( [ idenc ] ) we have @xmath114 thus , the non - trivial relation between the rate of change of the global magnetization , and the mean of the magnetization density at the origin , is seen to be exact within the continuum model ( which complements the exact relation @xmath115 found in the discrete framework ) .",

    "the two curves are indistinguishable within the numerical noise , thus confirming the global / local relation ( [ glomag3 ] ) .",
    "this also provides secondary confirmation of the continuum form of this relation eq.([glomagc3 ] ) with @xmath252 .",
    "in fig.8 we plot the ratio of the measured two point correlation function ( divided by @xmath146 ) versus @xmath248 .",

    "we have plotted the inverse of these functions against @xmath255 in order to compare with the theoretical prediction ( [ avdenasy ] ) .",
    "again , good agreement is found , thereby confirming the less rigorous method by which the two dimensional result was obtained .",
    "finally we mention our attempt to measure the probability distribution of the coarse grained magnetization density at the origin ( in @xmath3 ) , which was found from the continuum theory to be a log - normal distribution . clearly it does not make sense to measure moments of the spin at the origin , since the odd ( even ) moments are equal to @xmath256 ( unity ) .",
    "therefore , we define a coarse grained magnetization over a patch of spins . if the patch is taken too small , the coarse - graining will be ineffective , whilst if the patch is taken too large , the ba will take a long time to leave the patch , and the asymptotic behavior will be numerically inaccessible .",

    "in this paper we have introduced and analyzed a simple model of data corruption due to a brownian agent ( ba ) . in section ii we introduced a discrete version of the model , which consists of a ba flipping bits ( or spins ) on a lattice .",
    "the model is non - trivial since the value of a given spin depends very sensitively on the path of the ba ( _ i.e. _ whether the spin has been visited an odd or even number of times ) .",
    "we presented a master equation formulation of the model and derived an equation of motion for the conditional average of the magnetization density . in the continuum limit , this quantity was seen to satisfy an imaginary - time schrdinger equation ( itse ) for a particle in a repulsive @xmath37-function potential .",
    "higher - order conditional averages also satisfy itse s with an additional repulsive @xmath32-function potential for each spin being averaged .",
    "we also proved that there is an exact proportionality between the rate of change of the mean global magnetization @xmath257 ( as defined in eq.([glomag ] ) ) and the mean magnetization density at the origin , thus revealing a non - trivial statistical relation between a global and a local quantity .",
    "in section iii we recast the discrete model as a stochastic cellular automaton ( sca ) . from the local rules of the sca",
    ", we postulated a particularly simple continuum theory written in terms of a coarse - grained magnetization density @xmath60 ( which is a functional of the walk @xmath49 of the ba ) .",
    "we showed that averages of this stochastic field may be recast as integrals over the final ba position , the integrands of which are imaginary - time path integrals ( itpi s ) .",
    "these itpi s were shown to describe quantum systems of repulsive @xmath37-function potentials identical to those revealed through the itse formulation of the master equation . in this way",
    "we have confirmed that the continuum theory is a good representation of the underlying discrete model .",
    "[ it is worth mentioning that averages of @xmath258 correspond to the quantum mechanics of an _ attractive _ @xmath32-function potential . in this case",
    "there is the possibility of a sharp transition in behavior for @xmath230 as one varies @xmath155 , since bound states only exist for a sufficiently attractive well . ]    in section iv we thoroughly examined the properties of the continuum theory for @xmath3 .",

    "the results are not of high enough quality to directly compare with the derived log - normal distribution ; however , we do see clear evidence of a long robust tail of the histogram for values of @xmath61 near unity , which is a clear signature of the importance of extreme fluctuations .    in conclusion , we have introduced and solved a model in which a ba interacts with a bimodal environment ( _ i.e. _ a medium containing two types of particles , spins , bits , etc . ) .",
    "our primary application has been an environment composed of bits of data , which the ba steadily corrupts .",
    "we have been interested in the statistical correlations and fluctuations of the disordered medium , and our exact results ( arising from a simple continuum model ) reveal the correlations to be non - trivial and the fluctuations to be extreme in nature .",
    "these statements are made quantitative by the form of the two - point correlation function , and the probability distribution of the density of corrupted bits .",
    "there are many directions for future work , foremost amongst which are : i ) calculating the distribution @xmath164 in @xmath196 and determining its sensitivity to the smearing function @xmath117 , ii ) investigating autocorrelation effects in one dimension , iii ) refining the model to take into account relevant factors ( like a back - coupling between the environment and the ba , or an asymmetry in the flipping probability ) which will arise if one tries to make a stronger connection to real processes .",
    "the model may also be seen to be a very simplified version of other systems .",
    "for instance the bistable medium can be taken to be composed of two chemical species a and b ( with vanishingly low mobility ) and the ba to be a high mobility catalyst , inducing a reversible reaction between a and b ( and _ vice versa _ ) .",
    "alternatively we can think of the ba as a wandering impurity in an ionic crystal ( such as an anion or cation vacancy in _ nacl _ ) or a semiconductor compound ( such as _ zn _ in _ gaas _ ) , which has a small probability of reordering the local bi - atomic structure as it passes through a given unit cell@xcite .",
