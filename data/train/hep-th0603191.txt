    "it is well known that different types of topological objects may have been formed in the early universe after planck time by the vacuum phase transition @xcite . depending on the topology of the vacuum manifold these are domains walls , strings , monopoles and textures . among them , cosmic strings and monopoles seem to be the best candidate to be observed .    a global monopole is a spherical heavy object formed in the phase transition of a system composed by a self - coupling scalar field iso - triplet @xmath0 , whose original global @xmath1 symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath2 .",
    "the matter fields play the role of an order parameter which outside the monopole s core acquires a non - vanishing value . the simplified global monopole was introduced by sokolov and starobinsky @xcite .",
    "the gravitational effects of of the global monopole were considered in ref .",
    "b - v , where a solution is presented which describes a global monopole at large radial distances .",
    "the gravitational effects produced by this object may be approximated by a solid angle deficit in the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime whose line element is given by @xmath3here the parameter @xmath4 is smaller than unity and depends on the energy scale @xmath5 where the global symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor associated with this topological object has a diagonal form and reads : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the spacetime defined by the metric tensor above is not flat : the scalar curvature @xmath8 and the solid angle is @xmath9 , smaller than the ordinary one , consequently there is a solid angle deficit given by @xmath10 .",
    "it is of interest to note that the effective metric produced in superfluid @xmath11 by a monopole is described by the line element ( [ mmetric ] ) with the negative angle deficit , @xmath12 , which corresponds to the negative mass of the topological object @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticles in this model are chiral and massless fermions .",
    "the quantum effects due to the point - like global monopole spacetime on the matter fields have been considered for massless scalar @xcite and fermionic @xcite fields , respectively ( for the heat - kernels on the generalized cone see @xcite ) . in order to develop this analysis ,",
    "the scalar respectively spinor green functions in this background have been obtained .",
    "the influence of the non - zero temperature on these polarization effects has been considered in @xcite for scalar and fermionic fields . moreover ,",
    "the calculation of quantum effects on massless scalar field in a higher dimensional global monopole spacetime has also been developed in @xcite .",
    "two important ingredients responsible for vacuum polarization effects are the non - trivial geometry of the spacetime itself and boundary conditions obeyed by the matter fields . in this direction ,",

    "more recently , using also this formalism , a similar analysis for spinor fields has been developed in @xcite . in these publications",
    "two distinct situations were examined : the vacuum averages inside and outside the shell .",
    "the generalized abel - plana summation formula is a powerful instrument which allows to develop the summation over all discrete modes . by using this formula , all the physical vacuum polarization local quantities",
    "can be separated in two contributions : boundary dependent parts and independent ones .",
    "the boundary independent contributions are similar to previous results obtained in the literature for scalar and fermionic fields , @xcite , using different approach .",
    "these contributions are divergent and consequently in order to obtain finite and well defined results , one must apply some regularization procedure .",
    "the boundary dependent contributions , on the other hand , are finite at any strictly interior or exterior points and do not contain anomalies .",
    "consequently , they do not require any regularization procedure .",
    "bosonic casimir densities induced by two concentric spherical shells in the global monopole spacetime have been analyzed in @xcite .",

    "specifically we shall calculate the vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor and the vacuum interaction forces between two shells . also the total casimir energy will be considered .    the casimir effect associated with fermionic fields in a minkowski background ,",
    "was considered in a great number of papers bend76,milt80,milt81,milt83,baac83,blau88,eliz98,cogn01 ( for reviews and additional references see @xcite ) , considering that the fields obey the mit bag model condition . as far as we know ,",
    "the most of the previous studies were focused on global quantities , such as the total vacuum energy and stress on the surface .",
    "the density of the fermionic vacuum condensate for a massless spinor field inside the bag was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . as to the casimir effect it is of physical interest to calculate not only the total energy but also the local characteristics of the vacuum , such as the energy - momentum tensor and vacuum condensate .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source of gravity in the einstein equations .",
    "it therefore plays an important role in modelling a self - consistent dynamics involving the gravitational field @xcite . for @xmath13 case ,",
