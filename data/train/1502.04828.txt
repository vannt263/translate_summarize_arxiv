    "slow relaxation @xcite is the process whereby a system evolves without reaching equilibrium in finite times . physical realizations of this phenomenon are observed in many materials , for instance ferromagnets , binary or complex fluids and glasses , when they are subjected to a drastic change of thermodynamic control parameters , as in a temperature quench or a pressure crunch . in the large - time regime",
    "these systems exhibit typical features of equilibrium , such as the absence of macroscopic currents and the constancy of one - time observables , together with hallmarks of non - stationarity , like the lack of time - reversal invariance and the dependence of two - time quantities on the system s age @xmath0 , i.e. , the time elapsed after the initial change of parameters .",
    "these apparently contrasting features can be interpreted in a coherent way if the degrees of freedom of the non - equilibrium state can be classified into groups with different properties @xcite . in the simplest cases , including ferromagnetic systems and the model considered in this paper , this amounts to identify those degrees whose evolution is sufficiently fast and unrelated to the global non - equilibrium condition of the system to rapidly self - equilibrate with respect to the new value of the control parameters .",
    "these _ fast _ degrees , whose collection we will indicate with @xmath1 in the following , are responsible for the appearance of the typical features of equilibrated systems discussed above .",
    "the rest of the system  constrained degrees which are not able to efficiently equilibrate with respect to the new control parameters  are a _",
    "component , denoted here with @xmath2 , which gives rise to the aging properties , namely non - stationarity and lack of time - reversal invariance .",
    "this separation into two classes is fundamental to understand the properties of aging systems : the possibility to disentangle global properties into their very different contributions has represented a groundbreaking tool towards the recognition of the ultimate scaling structure underlying the evolution .",
    "however , despite the relevance of the subject , a precise operative definition of fast and slow degrees is , in general , difficult to adopt and a convincing proof of their existence has been given , as to now , only in few cases @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a simple paradigmatic example of aging dynamics , the zeta urn model @xcite , where fast and slow degrees can be easily identified , their different properties can be studied , and a clear picture of their mutual interplay can be drawn .",
    "the scaling properties of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are explicitly worked out and the relative contribution to the behavior of different observables , either dependent on a single time or on two times , is discussed .",
    "we also discuss how different and _ a priori _ unrelated operative definitions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 lead to the same overall properties , confirming that the separation of degrees is a robust and general property of aging which does not depend on the details of the procedure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ twotime ] we review on general grounds the behavior of one - time and two - time quantities , showing how they differently encode the non - equilibrium properties . in section [ statag ] a general identification of slow and fast components is made , their statistical properties are worked out , and their mirroring in physical observables is analyzed . in section [ urnmod ]",
    "we introduce the zeta urn model that will be considered in the remaining of the paper .",
    "the result of a numerical study of the model is presented in the following section [ numerical ] , where we explicitly show a consistent way to identify the sets @xmath1 and @xmath2 and explore their contribution to one - time and two - time quantities .",
    "section [ concl ] contains our conclusions and the discussion of some open issues .",
    "let us denote with @xmath5 the number of degrees of freedom which are separated into the fast set @xmath3 and the slow one @xmath4 .",
    "since the system is approaching equilibrium , where by definition out - of - equilibrium modes are absent , the _ measure _ of @xmath2 is bound to decrease as the evolution proceeds , _ tn_(t)=0 .",
    "[ nsig0 ] this occurs independently of the capacity of the system to reach equilibrium in a finite time ( interrupted aging ) or not . in the following",
    "we will always consider the second case , where equilibration is never achieved , which requires the thermodynamic limit @xmath6 to be taken before the large - time limit @xmath7 .",
    "the organization of the internal modes into two sets is reflected in the behavior of any physical observable @xmath8 . in the case in which @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be considered statistically independent ,",
    "an additive form = o_+ o_[additive ] is found , with obvious notation .",
    "let us consider one - time quantities first , as for instance the internal energy , the pressure or the density .",
    "due to the equilibrated character of @xmath1 , @xmath9 reaches almost immediately its time - independent equilibrium value @xmath10 . for example , taking @xmath11 as the energy , @xmath12 represents the internal energy that the system would possess in the final equilibrium state .",
    "if @xmath8 is sufficiently _ regular _ , in a sense that will be more precise at the end of this section , since @xmath13 for sufficiently long times , one generally has _",
    "t o_(t)=0 .",
    "[ eqquant ] for this reason , if @xmath14 is large enough and @xmath10 is finite , the contribution of @xmath15 represents only a small vanishing correction and this makes one - time observables basically indistinguishable from their constant equilibrium value .",
    "this however does not mean that the system is equilibrated , but only that the contribution of the @xmath16-s is negligible in the one - time quantities . clearly , if @xmath10 is known the small aging contribution @xmath15 can be evidenced by subtracting @xmath10 from @xmath8 .",
    "the non - equilibrium aging character is instead more manifest in the behavior of two - time quantities ( again sufficiently _ regular _ , see below ) @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , such as correlation functions or responses . in the asymptotic time - domain in which the age @xmath0 of the sample is large , the typical timescales @xmath19 and @xmath20 over which fast and slow degrees decorrelate are widely separated . indeed , while @xmath21 is usually an increasing function of @xmath0 , @xmath19 is generally microscopic and age - independent , again due to the fact that @xmath22 is basically in equilibrium .",
    "this is made evident by the fact that a two - time quantity @xmath17 can probe either fast or slow degrees according to the direction along which the large - time limit is approached in the @xmath23 plane .",
    "specifically , if we let @xmath24 while keeping @xmath25 finite , since @xmath26 the slow degrees act adiabatically and can be considered as static . in this time sector , denoted as the short time difference ( or quasi - equilibrium ) regime , one sheds light on the dynamical behavior of fast modes .",
    "indeed @xmath27 , which depends only on @xmath25 due to the stationarity of @xmath28 , converges to its asymptotic equilibrium value @xmath29 in a rather short time @xmath30 in which @xmath31 can not change appreciably and remains fixed to its equal - time value @xmath32 .",
    "this is pictorially shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figcorr ] , where the behavior of a typical two - time quantity , the autocorrelation function @xmath33 of a spin system ( see the definition in eq .",
    "( [ autoco ] ) ) , and its contributions @xmath34 are sketched .",
    "the short time difference sector is on the left part of the picture .",
    "conversely , letting again @xmath24 but keeping @xmath35 ( or the ratio @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a monotonously increasing function , in specific systems ) finite , one has @xmath38 : this means that the analysis is focused on the timescale of the slow ( or aging ) components . in this time sector , usually denoted as aging regime ( on the right side of the left panel of of fig .",
    "[ figcorr ] ) , the fast degrees act as a stationary background and the time evolution of the slow modes is probed .",
    "indeed , from @xmath39 onward also @xmath31 starts changing and @xmath8 moves from the plateau @xmath40 to the final value @xmath41 .",
    "generally , a good separation of the degrees can only be operated for very large times .",
    "the previous discussion shows that , in this case , two - time observables are quantities particularly fitted to highlight the role played by @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we mentioned before that @xmath44 occurs for sufficiently _ regular _",
    "observables @xmath8 .",
    "we now precise this point .",
    "consider , in order to keep the discussion simple , a quantity that can be expressed as @xmath45 , where the index @xmath46 runs over the microscopic degrees of freedom and @xmath47 is the contribution of one such degree .",
    "this is usually the case when dealing with extensive quantities",
    ". then we can write @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the _ average _ contribution to @xmath31 provided by one slow degree .",
    "if the time - dependence of @xmath49 is such that @xmath50 , then @xmath51 and we call @xmath8 an _ equilibrating _ quantity . otherwise , the contribution of @xmath31 does not disappear and @xmath52 .",
    "depending on the system considered and on the nature of @xmath8 either situation can be observed . in most cases",
    "@xmath53 is weakly dependent on time , and the corresponding observable is an equilibrating one .",
    "for instance the energy of a non - disordered magnet quenched to a temperature @xmath54 below the critical temperature converges to the value @xmath55 provided by the standard equilibrium statistical mechanical calculation .",
    "however there are also some notable exceptions , as for instance the response function @xmath56 ( a quantity deeply related to the magnetic energy ) of a disordered one - dimensional magnet quenched to @xmath57 , as described by the ising chain with a random magnetic field of strength @xmath58 . in the limit",
    "@xmath59 one finds  @xcite @xmath60 .",
    "a possible identification of fast and slow degrees , based on arguments similar to the ones discussed in the previous section , can be given along the lines of ref .",

    "conversely , in the effort to build the condensate , one urn in the liquid phase have the tendency to increase its number of marbles . this occurs up to a long time ( of order @xmath0 ) when the competition with another prevailing urn will become effective and it will be progressively depleted . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath86 is expected to show a pronounced maximum at a time monotonously increasing with @xmath0 and then to decrease to zero .",
    "all these features are clearly displayed in the main part of fig .",
    "[ figcorurns ] , where the autocorrelation is plotted against @xmath177 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "let us start by considering the solid green lines , which correspond to the whole correlation @xmath33 .",
    "the curves relative to different values of @xmath0 collapse for short times , up to @xmath178 . in this regime @xmath33",
    "is negative .",
    "what we are observing in this region is clearly the evolution of the fast part @xmath179 .    from @xmath178",
    "onward the curves grow to a positive maximum , which is delayed and suppressed as @xmath0 is increased , and then decrease to zero .",
    "this is the behavior expected qualitatively for @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , in this regime the curves for different @xmath0 can be collapsed by plotting @xmath180 , against @xmath35 , as it can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figcorurns ] .",
    "this means that the scaling form c(t , t_w)^-3(t_w)c ( ) [ scalpart ] is obeyed , which is of the expected type ( [ twosc ] ) , with the behavior ( [ ell ] ) of @xmath89 previously found and @xmath181 , yet another consequence of the decrease ( [ liqzero ] ) of urns in the liquid phase .",
    "let us mention that the form ( [ scalpart ] ) is in agreement with the known behavior c(t , t_w)=(-_c)t_w^1/2(t / t_w ) , ( where @xmath182 is a scaling function ) of @xmath183 in the aging regime .",
    "indeed , by plugging this expression into eq .",
    "( [ tildevsno ] ) and expanding for large @xmath0 the various correlations on the r.h.s . around the value @xmath23 of their arguments ,",
    "one finds eq .",
    "( [ scalpart ] ) with @xmath184 , where @xmath185 .    in order to check the decomposition ( [ split ] )",
    "we have separated the urns into the gaseous and the liquid phase as discussed previously , and we have separately computed @xmath85 and @xmath86 by correlating among them degrees that pertain to one or the other set both at @xmath0 and @xmath14 .",
    "these quantities are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ figcorurns ] , where it is seen that they reproduce the whole quantity @xmath75 in the short - time ( @xmath85 ) and in the long - time regime ( @xmath186 ) , respectively .",
    "for @xmath86 we have also checked that the scaling ( [ scalpart ] ) is obeyed .    in order to better compare the behavior of the autocorrelation in the present urn model with that of a ferromagnet",
    "we have represented it pictorially in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figcorr ] using the same line styles and colors in the two cases .",
    "the analysis of the two panels shows that a similar scenario occurs , apart of course from the different functional form of the various correlations .",
    "according to the general paradigm discussed in sections [ intro ] , [ twotime ] , [ statag ] , @xmath179 should correspond to the correlation function of the target equilibrium state . in the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ figcorurns ] we plot this quantity computed in the aging regime by separating the degrees of freedom for different choices of @xmath0 .",
    "the data do not show any systematic dependence on @xmath0 , confirming that our definition of the set @xmath3 has the expected stationary property . in order to compare @xmath85 with the equilibrium autocorrelation",
    "we have computed the latter numerically : an efficient way to equilibrate the system at @xmath187 is to break the urn symmetry by starting from an initial configuration with all the marbles in one urn .",
    "this avoids the aging regime caused by the competition among urns and allows the system to quickly reach the equilibrium state .",
    "the quantity @xmath188 measured in this way is shown in the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ figcorurns ] with a heavy - dashed cyan curve .",
    "as expected , @xmath179 and @xmath188 coincide within numerical errors .",
    "the equilibrium autocorrelation could also be computed analytically starting from the known @xcite expression of @xmath168 c_eq()=a_eq(_f ) ^-(-3)/2 , where @xmath189 is a temperature - dependent constant . from this",
    "it is trivial to derive the expression c_eq()- a_eq ( _ f)^-(+1)/2 [ analceq ] for @xmath188 .",
    "we have checked that our numerical determination shown in the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ figcorurns ] coincides within errors with eq .",
    "( [ analceq ] ) .",
    "summarizing , our numerical data for the zeta urn model fit nicely in the general framework of slow relaxation discussed in sections [ intro ] , [ twotime ] , [ statag ] if the degrees of freedom of the system  the occupation numbers @xmath108  are divided into two sets @xmath3 and @xmath4 according to the recipe described in section [ occu ] .    before closing this section , we briefly comment on the robustness of the overall picture with respect to different definitions  but same in spirit  of the fast and slow degrees .",
    "we tried to address this issue by changing the definition of @xmath28 s and @xmath16 s and , next to the technique of section [ occu ] , we have separated slow and fast degrees using the running average procedure eqs .  ( [ runav],[defpsi ] ) of section [ statag ] .",
    "more precisely , considering the autocorrelation function @xmath75 we have defined the slow part as c_(t , t_w)=r_i ( t)r_i ( t_w)[otherslow ] where @xmath190 $ ] is the variation of number of marbles ( normalized by @xmath63 ) in the @xmath46-th urn in a time @xmath63 such that  as discussed in section [ statag ]  @xmath191 . inspection of fig .",
    "[ figcorurns ] suggests @xmath192 as reasonable values . by computing the quantity of eq .",
    "( [ otherslow ] ) we found that , for sufficiently large values of @xmath177 the curve obtained superimposes on the determination of @xmath186 obtained previously with the technique of section [ occu ] .",
    "this results confirms the robustness of the degree - separation scenario .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the paradigm of a simple class of aging systems where the dynamical properties can be accounted for by the coexistence of slow and fast degrees with different scaling properties .",
    "we have studied  in particular ",
    "the kinetics of the zeta urn model following a quench from high temperature to a final one below the condensation temperature .",
    "this model is a useful playground where fast and slow degrees have an intuitive interpretation in terms of the occupation numbers of different urns , allowing a distinction between a gaseous and a liquid phase , corresponding to the two sets @xmath3 and @xmath154 of fast and slow modes .",
    "we have considered the behavior of one - time quantities , as the energy , and of two - time ones , specifically the autocorrelation function .",
    "due to the progressive reduction of the _ measure _ of the aging set @xmath154 , one - time quantities rapidly attain the characteristic value of the final equilibrium state .",
    "non - equilibrium features are better observed in two - time quantities where the gaseous and the liquid component can be evidenced by increasing the two times along particular directions in the @xmath23 plane , namely focusing on the short - time or on the aging regime , very similarly to what is known for ferromagnetic or glassy spin systems .    the concept of an _ effective temperature _ is deeply related to the topic considered in the present article .",
    "this quantity , which was originally introduced in the context of mean - field glass models @xcite , can be obtained from the relation between an autocorrelation function and the correspondent response function . for systems  like the one considered here  where two sets of degrees can be identified , one would expect two different _ temperatures _ associated to them .",
    "accordingly , while the set @xmath22 is equilibrated at the bath temperature , a different _ effective _ temperature would characterize the slow part @xmath2 .",
    "an effective temperature for the zeta urn model based on the correlation ( [ cgod ] ) has already been investigated @xcite : the different insight that could be provided by starting from our new definition ( [ newcor ] ) instead remains an open issue for future research .",
