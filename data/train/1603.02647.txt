    "<S> it is also clarified that , in the odd - component system , the ordered state is realized at relatively lower temperatures and the critical temperature is constant in the strong coupling limit .    </S>",
    "<S> ultracold atomic systems have potential to understand some important and fundamental issues in the condensed matter physics  @xcite . among them , two - component fermionic systems with distinct hyperfine states are known to be appropriate to describe strongly correlated electron systems . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the high controllability in particle number , lattice potential , and interaction strength , remarkable phenomena have been observed such as superfluid state  @xcite , bcs - bec crossover  @xcite and mott insulating state  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , it is unclear how the stability of the ordered states depends on the parity of the components , which should be important to observe the spontaneously translational symmetry breaking state in the fermionic optical lattice experiments  @xcite .    motivated by this </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the su(@xmath0 ) hubbard model , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total number density of fermions at the @xmath8th site , @xmath9 indicates the nearest neighbor sites and @xmath10(@xmath11 ) creates ( annihilates ) a fermion with `` color '' @xmath12 at site @xmath8 and @xmath13 . </S>",

    "<S> to solve the effective impurity problem , we make use of the hybridization - expansion continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) method  @xcite , which should be suitable for systematic investigations on the hubbard model .    </S>",

    "<S> , width=302 ]    it is found that in the two - component system , the af state is widely stabilized at finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine low temperature properties under the paramagnetic condition . here </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate @xmath63 as a renormalization factor at finite temperatures , where @xmath64 is the selfenergy for color @xmath21 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the mott phase boundaries  @xcite , where a jump singularity appears in @xmath66 , are much lower than the magnetic one . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the fact that no mott transitions are realized in the bipartite system with @xmath29  @xcite .    as increasing @xmath0 , the mott critical temperature </S>",
    "<S> is increased  @xcite , in contrast to the decrease of the magnetic transition temperature . </S>",

    "<S> , width=302 ]    to clarify how particle correlations affect the phase transitions , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : t ] the temperature dependence of the order parameter and renormalization factor . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the latter is appropriate to discuss particle correlations characteristic of low energy properties . in the weak coupling region , </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization factor is large and the normal metallic state is realized above the critical temperature @xmath70 . in the af state ( @xmath71 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the order parameter gradually increases . in the intermediate coupling region @xmath72 , different behavior appears . </S>",
    "<S> decreasing temperatures , the renormalization factor decreases toward zero , implying that insulating behavior appears when @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has a minimum around @xmath74 and takes a larger value @xmath75 near the first - order transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this means the crossover from the insulating state to the metallic state . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that , in the two - band system ( @xmath76 ) , this correlated metallic state close to the mott transitions is stabilized due to the enhancement of spin and orbital fluctuations  @xcite . at lower temperatures , the jump singularity appears in the order parameter and the af state is realized . in the case </S>",
    "<S> , the large gap suddenly appears in the dos ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the intermediate coupling region , the first - order magnetic transition occurs together with the metal - insulator transition . in the strong coupling region with @xmath77 , critical behavior clearly appears around @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath79 , the renormalization factor is small enough to realize the mott insulating state .    in the system with @xmath55 , </S>",
    "<S> the mott critical temperature is higher than the magnetic transition temperature , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pd_re](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the mott transition indeed occurs when the interaction strength is changed at the intermediate temperature @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the metallic state is stable up to a fairly large interacting region at finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> then , the phase transition from the metallic ( mott ) state to the af state is of first ( second ) order . </S>",
    "<S> these results are essentially the same as those for the @xmath31 system .    in the even - component system with a large @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the correlated metallic state becomes more stable against the magnetic instability . </S>",
    "<S> roughly speaking , the metallic state is realized in the weak coupling region until the mott transition , which are characterized by three values : the boundaries for the coexisting region between metallic and mott insulating states at zero temperature @xmath44 and @xmath46 @xmath81 , and the critical end point @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that @xmath46 is proportional to the number of components @xmath0  @xcite , while the others are the square root of @xmath0  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the af state is realized at low temperatures @xmath83 in the strong coupling region ( @xmath84 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , in the large @xmath0 case , the phase diagram is similar to that for the @xmath55 system and the first - order phase transition between the correlated metallic and af states occurs in the intermediate coupling region .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we turn to the multicomponent system with @xmath85 . for convenience , we focus on the system with @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been clarified that the cdw and csaf states , which are schematically shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pic](c ) and ( d ) , are degenerate at zero temperature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed the detailed ctqmc calculations to deduce the critical temperatures for both states , and little difference between them has been found . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the following , we only show the results for the csaf state to discuss the stability of the ordered states in the system .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : m3_re ] shows the order parameter @xmath87 in the three - component system .     as functions of the repulsive interaction @xmath42 in the three component system when @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . , width=302 ]    when @xmath41 , the ordered state is realized in the intermediate region @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is similar to magnetic behavior in the two - component system , where the phase transitions are of second order . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , decreasing temperature , different behavior appears in the strong coupling region , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : m3_re ] . when @xmath91 , the increase in the interaction @xmath15 decreases the order parameter @xmath87 slowly </S>",
    "<S> we find no phase transition to the paramagnetic state , at least , until @xmath92 . at the lower temperature @xmath93 , </S>",

    "<S> , width=302 ]    in the @xmath32 system , the transition temperature takes the maximum @xmath96 around @xmath97 , which is relatively lower than the phase boundaries for the even - component system discussed before . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in the interaction strength decreases the critical temperature monotonically . by extrapolating the phase boundary </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a finite critical temperature @xmath98 in the limit @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> this remarkable behavior should be explained by the following . when one considers the csaf state  [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pic](d ) ] , a fermion in the doubly occupied sites can hop freely to the nearest neighbor singly occupied sites and the metallic state is realized even in the strong coupling limit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is contrast to the even - component system , where the corresponding energy cost is proportional to the onsite interaction strength @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this should suggest that the effective intersite interaction between the localized spins @xmath100 is proportional to the bandwidth , resulting in the finite critical temperature @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> this may recall us the bose - einstein condensation in a free bosonic system since the transition temperature does not depend on the interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it may allow us to discuss the bcs - bec crossover in the two - component fermi gas , which is now under consideration .    </S>",
    "<S> an ordered state is also realized in the system with @xmath95 . in the case , the transition temperature is much lower than that for the @xmath32 system , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pd3_re ] . </S>",

    "<S> however , the ordered state , shown as solid circles in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pd3_re ] , is realized even in the strong coupling region . </S>",
