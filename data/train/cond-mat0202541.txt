    "the pseudogap phenomena in high @xmath2 superconductors have been a great challenge to condensed matter physicists since over a decade ago .",
    "these phenomena manifestly contradict bcs theory by , e.g , presenting a pseudo excitation gap in single particle excitation spectrum .",
    "yet the origin of the pseudogap and , in general , the mechanism of the superconductivity are still not clear .",
    "many theories have been proposed , which fall into two classes , based on whether the pseudogap has a superconducting origin .",
    "some authors propose that the pseudogap may not be related to the superconductivity ; instead , it is associated with another ordered state , such as the antiferromagnetism related resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state,@xcite d - density wave@xcite and spin density wave order.@xcite on the other hand , many others believe that the pseudogap has the same origin as the superconductivity , such as the phase fluctuation scenario of emery and kivelson@xcite and the various precursor superconductivity scenarios.@xcite previously , chen and coworkers have worked out , within the precursor conductivity school , a pairing fluctuation theory@xcite which enables one to calculate quantitatively physical quantities such as the phase diagram , the superfluid density , etc . for a clean system . in this theory ,",
    "two - particle and one - particle green s functions are treated on an equal footing , and equations are solved self - consistently .",
    "finite center - of - mass momentum pair excitations become important as the pairing interaction becomes strong , and lead to a pseudogap in the excitation spectrum . in this context , these authors have been able to obtain a phase diagram and calculate the superfluid density , in ( semi)quantitative agreement with experiment .",
    "however , to fully apply this theory to the cuprates , we need to extend it to impurity cases , since impurities are present even in the cleanest samples of the high @xmath2 materials , such as the optimally doped yba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath12 ( ybco ) single crystals .",
    "in addition , this is necessary in order to understand the finite frequency conductivity issue .",
    "furthermore , study of how various physical quantities respond to impurity scattering may help to reveal the underlying mechanism of the superconductivity .",
    "for example , it can be used to determine whether the pseudogap has a superconducting origin.@xcite particularly , it is important to address how @xmath2 and the pseudogap itself vary with impurity scattering , especially in the underdoped regime . to this end , one needs to go beyond bcs theory and include the pseudogap as an intrinsic part of the theory . due to the complexity and technical difficulties of this problem",
    ", there has been virtually no work in the field on this important problem .    among all physical quantities , the density of states ( dos ) @xmath13 close to the fermi level ( @xmath14 ) is probably most sensitive to the impurities . yet",
    "different authors have yielded contradictory results in this regard .",
    "bcs - based impurity @xmath0 matrix calculations predict a finite dos at @xmath14,@xcite which has been used to explain the crossover from @xmath0 to @xmath15 power law for the low temperature superfluid density.@xcite nonperturbative approaches have also been studied and have yielded different results .",
    "senthil and fisher@xcite find that dos vanishes according to universal power laws , ppin and lee@xcite predict that @xmath13 diverges as @xmath16 , assuming a strict particle - hole symmetry , and ziegler@xcite and coworkers calculation shows a rigorous lower bound on @xmath13 .",
    "recently , atkinson _ _ et al.__@xcite try to resolve these contradictions by fine - tuning the details of the disorders .",
    "nevertheless , all these calculations are based on bcs theory and can not include the pseudogap in a self - consistent fashion , and thus can only be applied to the low @xmath0 limit in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to extend the bcs - based calculations on impurity issues to include the pseudogap self - consistently .    in this paper , we extend the pairing fluctuation theory from clean to impurity cases .",
    "both the impurity scattering and particle - particle scattering @xmath0 matrices are incorporated and treated self - consistently .",
    "this goes far beyond the usual self - consistent ( impurity ) @xmath0-matrix calculations at the bcs level by , e.g. , hirschfeld and others.@xcite in this context , we study the evolution of @xmath2 and various gap parameters as a function of the coupling strength , the impurity concentration , the hole doping concentration and the impurity scattering strength . in addition , we study not only the born and the unitary limits , but also at intermediate scattering strength .",
    "we find that the real part of the frequency renormalization can never be set to zero , the chemical potential adjusts itself with the impurity level . as a consequence , the positive and negative strong scattering limits do not meet .",
    "the residue density of states at the fermi level is generally finite at finite impurity concentrations , in agreement with what has been observed experimentally .",
    "both @xmath2 and the total excitation gap decrease with increasing impurity level , as one may naively expect .",
    "born scatterers are about twice as effective as unitary scatters in suppressing @xmath2 and the gap . in the unitary limit",
    ", the zero temperature superfluid density decreases faster with @xmath9 when @xmath9 is still small , whereas in the born limit , it is the opposite . at given @xmath6 , both the order parameter and the total gap are suppressed , but the pseudogap is not . finally , incoherent pair excitations contribute an additional @xmath8 term to the low @xmath0 temperature dependence of the superfluid density , robust against impurity scattering .    in the next section ,",
    "we first review the theory in a clean system , and then present a theory at the abrikosov - gorkov level .",
    "finally , we generalize it to include the full impurity @xmath0-matrix , in addition to the particle - particle scattering @xmath0-matrix , in the treatment , and obtain a set of three equations to solve for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and various gaps . in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , we present numerical solutions to these equations .",
    "we first study the effects of impurity scattering on the density of states , then study the effects on @xmath2 and the pseudogap at @xmath2 , followed by calculations of the effects on the gaps and the superfluid density below @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we discuss some related issues , and conclude our paper .",
    "the excitation gap forms as a consequence of cooper pairing in bcs theory , while the superconductivity requires the formation of the zero - momentum cooper pair condensate .",
    "as these two occurs at the same temperature in bcs theory , one natural way to extend bcs theory is to allow pair formation at a higher temperature ( @xmath17 ) and the bose condensation of the pairs at a lower temperature ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , these pairs are phase incoherent at @xmath18 , leading to a pseudogap without superconductivity .",
    "this can nicely explain the existence of the pseudogap in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "precursor superconductivity scenarios , e.g. , the present theory , provides a natural extension of this kind . at weak coupling ,",
    "the contribution of incoherent pairs is negligible and one thus recovers bcs theory , with @xmath19 . as the coupling strength increases ,",
    "incoherent pair excitations become progressively more important , and @xmath17 can be much higher than @xmath2 , as found in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "in general , both fermionic bogoliubov quasiparticles and bosonic pair excitations coexist at finite @xmath6 .",
    "the cuprates can be modeled as a system of fermions which have an anisotropic lattice dispersion @xmath20 , with an effective , short range pairing interaction @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the in - plane and out - of - plane hopping integrals , respectively , and @xmath1 is the fermionic chemical potential . for the cuprates , @xmath25 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath26 the pairing symmetry is given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29- and @xmath30-wave , respectively . here and in what follows , we use the superscript `` 0 '' for quantities in the clean system , to be consistent with the notations for the impurity dressed counterpart below . for brevity",
    ", we use a four - momentum notation : @xmath31 , etc .    to focus on the superconductivity , we consider only the pairing channel , following early work by kadanoff and martin;@xcite the self - energy is given by multiple particle - particle scattering .",
    "the infinite series of the equations of motion are truncated at the three - particle level @xmath32 , and @xmath32 is then factorized into single- ( @xmath33 ) and two - particle ( @xmath34 ) green s functions .",

    "when the gap is small , the contribution of the incoherent pair excitations is usually small , and does not have a strong effect on @xmath2 , so that @xmath2 is roughly determined by its bcs mean - field solution .",
    "when @xmath9 is large , the fermionic frequency renormalization is strong , and the pair dispersion also becomes highly damped . in this case ,",

    "unfortunately , we still do not know yet how to solve the dyson s equations without this approximation due to technical difficulties .    another simplification comes from the @xmath30-wave symmetry of the cuprate superconductors under study . although we have kept the theoretical formalism general for both @xmath29- and @xmath30-wave in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , the pairing vertex renormalization drops out when we finally carry out numerical calculations for @xmath30-wave superconductors . for @xmath29-wave superconductors , one would have to include self - consistently one more complex equation for the renormalization of @xmath217 , when solving for the renormalization of @xmath168 . and",
    "the equations ( [ eq : tw ] ) and ( [ eq : tdelta ] ) also look much more complicated than eq .",
    "( [ eq : tfinal ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , since there is no node in the excitation gap for @xmath29-wave , the numerics is expected to run faster .",
    "it is well - known that for @xmath30-wave superconductors , the anderson s theorem@xcite breaks down.@xcite for anderson s theorem to hold , it requires that the gap and the frequency are renormalized in exactly the same fashion .",
    "this condition can be satisfied ( approximately ) only in weak coupling , isotropic bcs @xmath29-wave superconductors , for which the real part of the frequency renormalization is negligible .",
    "since the frequency @xmath168 is a scalar , this condition is violated when the gap @xmath217 have any anisotropic dependence on @xmath340 .",
    "furthermore , when the gap is considerably large in comparison with the band width so that the upper limit of the energy integral can not be extended to infinity , this condition will not be satisfied , either . in both cases , @xmath2 will be suppressed .",

    "the real part of the frequency renormalization , in general , can not be set to zero in a self - consistent calculation .",
    "the chemical potential varies with the impurity concentration , so that the assumption of exact particle - hole symmetry is not justified when one studies the impurity effects .",
    "one consequence of this chemical potential shift is that the repulsive and attractive unitary scattering limits do not meet as has been widely assumed in the non - self - consistent treatment in the literature .",
    "unitary scatterers fill in the dos mostly in the small @xmath168 region , whereas born scatterers do in essentially the whole range within the gap . at small @xmath9 and/or small @xmath240",
    ", there is a dip at @xmath14 in the dos , so that @xmath13 vanishes as a fractional power of @xmath168 , which may in turn contribute a fractional power law for the low @xmath0 temperature dependence of the penetration depth .",
    "both @xmath2 and the pseudogap @xmath297 are suppressed by impurities . in this respect ,",
    "born scatterers are about twice as effective as unitary scatterer . treating zinc impurities as unitary scatterers",
    "explains why the actual @xmath2 suppression is only half that predicted by calculations at the ag level ( i.e. , in the born limit ) . in the overdoped regime ,",
    "the gap is small , and therefore the superconductivity can be easily destroyed by a small amount of impurities . in contrast , it takes a larger amount of impurities to destroy the large excitation gap in the underdoped regime .",
    "the reason @xmath297 is suppressed is mainly because @xmath2 is suppressed .",
    "in fact , for a given @xmath342 , the pseudogap remains roughly unchanged ( actually it increases slightly ) .",
    "the suppression of the total excitation gap arises from the suppression of the order parameter .",
    "the density of incoherent pairs , as measured by @xmath343 , slightly increases for not - so - large @xmath9 .",
    "this supports the notion that nonmagnetic impurities do not mainly break incoherent pairs .",
    "instead , they scatter the cooper pairs out of the condensate.@xcite    our self - consistent calculations show that in the unitary limit , the low @xmath0 superfluid density is quadratic in @xmath0 in a bcs @xmath30-wave superconductor , in agreement with existing calculations and experiment .",
    "strong pair excitations add an additional @xmath8 term , with preliminary experimental support . as a function of increasing @xmath9 ,",
