    "the notion of `` spatially heterogeneous dynamics '' or `` dynamic heterogeneity '' in glass - forming liquids has attracted much attention in recent decades and has been considered central to understanding the slow dynamics of glasses  @xcite .",

    "experimentally , various nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and other spectroscopic techniques have revealed `` heterogeneous '' relaxation of the non - exponential decays in glassy systems ,  @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "the non - exponential relaxation can be explained as the superposition of individual particle contributions with different relaxation rates  @xcite .",

    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the spatio - temporal structures of dynamic heterogeneities by numerically calculating the multi - point and multi - time correlation functions . in particular , we extensively investigate the manner in which the specifics of the model influence the extracted length and time scales .",
    "recently , the effects of the model details on the static correlation and the dynamics have been critically examined for the binary kob  andersen model and its weeks  chandler  andersen modification  @xcite . while the pair correlations of these models are almost identical , the structural relaxation times differ significantly .",
