    "2 ( c ) , it is obvious that the concurrence has two pairs of local maximal values . compared with fig .",
    "2 ( b ) , one can easily find that these two local maximal entanglement perfectly correspond to the local optimal photon antibunching and bunching .",
    "such a correspondence can also be supported by the analytic expression given in eq .",

    "thus @xmath96 occupies the relatively dominant proportion in @xmath127 .",
    "however , the interaction strength is proportional to the second order of @xmath131 .",
    "so the entanglements at these points get the extremum ( @xmath92 and @xmath132 ) , but they are still much less than the entanglement at @xmath84 and @xmath133 .",
    "we would like to point that the consistency between photon statistics and entanglement is attribute to that they can be understood in a unified and intuitive way .",
    "the resonant transitions of both single - photon process and double - photon process , as the essential physics of photon antibunching and bunching , correspond to the superposition of the ground state and an entangled state .",
    "so the maximal atomic entanglement is well consistent with photon statistics .",
    "given the ( weak ) driving strength , the single - photon process happens with a much larger probability than of double - photon process , so the entanglement subject to double - photon process is small .",
    "however , it is interesting that the maximal photon bunching point at @xmath99 does not correspond to an extremum of entanglement . the reason is attributed to the dark - state process which provides a channel ( as mentioned in the part of photon statistics ) to be converted to the state @xmath134 as well as @xmath135 .",
    "their proportions in @xmath127 get relatively larger . the net effect on entanglement",

    "physically , the large deviation of the correspondence is directly attributed to the large line width of the level induced by the dissipations .",
    "next , we will consider how thermal photons and the atomic dephasing influence our results .",
    "in fact , it can be easily predicted that our results will be destroyed greatly since quantum feature ( especially the entanglement ) is generally quite fragile to these environments .",

    "the correspondence relations can be kept with less thermal photons until the entanglement vanishes .",
    "in addition , photon bunching can be enhanced at other places , which just shows the participation of the thermal photons .",

    ", we will give a brief analysis on whether the conditions that we require are achievable in practical experiments .",
    "based on the previous sections , we should note that the possibility to realize the proposal mainly depends on the strong coupling rate ( @xmath149 and @xmath150 for our numerical simulation ) .",

    "to sum up , we have analyzed the physical mechanisms of photon statistics and entanglement in detail .",
    "we find that the local maximal entanglement always correspond to the local optimal photon bunching and antibunching points .",
    "in other words , the local extremum of photon statistics subject to the resonance processes are in good agreement with the local maximal entanglement .",

    "one could think that the correspondence between atomic entanglement and photon antibunching could be easily understood since both of them are the quantum feature , whereas it could be strange that the quantum feature ( atomic entanglement ) corresponded to a classical effect ( photon bunching ) .",
    "we also consider how the correspondence is affected by thermal noises and pure dephasing .",
    "in addition , we would like to provide a qualitative physical interpretation again . in cqed model",
    ", the photon antibunching essentially corresponds to resonant transition between the ground state and the single - excitation eigen - modes and bunching corresponds to the transition between the ground state and the two - excitation eigen - modes .",

    "this is the key matching mechanism .",
    "so photon statistics corresponding to such transition procedures are consistent to the extremum entanglement .",
    "but the double - excitation procedures happen with relatively little probability due to the weak driving , so the entanglement is much smaller .",
    "all the above analysis are obviously limited under the condition that the incoming photon ( energy ) can be well kept and no extra photons disturb this matching mechanism .",
    "this just means the weak dissipation . on the contrary ,",
    "the strong decays ( @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) , the large thermal photon number as well as the dephasing reduce and even break the matching relation , so the correspondence gets worse .",
