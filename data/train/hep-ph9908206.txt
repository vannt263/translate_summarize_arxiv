    "@xcite have studied the interaction of a neutrino beam with an electron plasma and concluded that the neutrino fluxes produced in supernovae are intense enough to cause plasma instabilities with large growth rates . if true this would provide a physical mechanism of energy transfer from the neutrinos to the plasma that might explain the supernova explosions .",

    "the erenkov emission of longitudinal photons by _ massless _ standard model neutrinos in an isotropic plasma has been studied along the years @xcite .",
    "this is a single neutrino decay but not a collective neutrino process .",
    "hardy and melrose @xcite gave one step more by extending the work to spontaneous and _ stimulated  emission and absorption _ of plasmons to study the so - called kinetic instabilities ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they obtained an expression for the decay  ( growth ) rate of the plasma waves induced by a neutrino flux .",
    "however , because the derivation was based on single neutrino processes the result is necessarily proportional to @xmath0 excluding _ apriori _ any possible non - linear effects . in the present paper",
    "we derive the neutrino contribution to the photon self - energy and obtain a modified dispersion relation for the longitudinal waves .",
    "this allows one to study not only kinetic instabilities but also the possible existence of hydrodynamic instabilities and non - linear phenomena .",

    "less than one ( @xmath229 , necessary for erenkov neutrino emission ) becomes vanishing small thus suppressing the relative factor @xmath230 in the dispersion relation . on the other hand , the collisional damping in a non - relativistic plasma is many orders of magnitude larger than the  neutrino landau damping . to conclude",
    ", it looks that the neutrinos are not capable of transferring any significant energy to the medium through plasma wave instabilities .",
    "we applied the techniques of finite temperature field theory to study the longitudinal modes of the electromagnetic waves in a plasma crossed by an intense neutrino flux .",
    "it is shown that for an isotropic plasma the electron axial - vector couplings and polarization effects are suppressed by @xmath231 in the dispersion relation . only the electron vector couplings ( weak and electromagnetic ) contribute at @xmath0 order .",
    "in addition , in the limit of frequencies and wavenumbers much smaller than the individual electron and neutrino energies , the susceptibility tensors derived from field theory are well approximated by the results obtained with classic kinetic theory provided that the electroweak interactions are described with the appropriate forces . as a result of the vectorial nature of the interactions , the weak forces are of the same type as the lorentz electromagnetic force .",
    "they diverge however from the forces employed by other authors @xcite in particular the ponderomotive force of bingham _",

    "@xcite the neutrinos were treated with a wave function obeying a sort of klein - gordon equation with an external potential accounting for the interaction with the medium .",
    "the collective effects were attributed there to a puzzling phase coherence between the neutrino wave functions .",
    "there is nothing wrong with that : it simply means that under an external plasma wave of wavenumber @xmath232 the neutrino wave function fluctuations share a phase factor , common to all neutrinos ( @xmath233 ) , on top of the arbitrary initial phases of each neutrino wave function .",
    "the problem was rather that in this klein - gordon sort of equation ( which could in principle be derived by squaring the dirac equation ) all the terms that might depend on the external potential derivatives or electron 3-vector current were completely discarded .",
    "that is fine to study problems like neutrino oscillations but not for neutrino effects on plasma waves because their very nature concerns the variations of the medium densities on the time and length scales of the wave period and wavelength .    the other problem concerns the claimed @xcite non - linear effects and plasma instabilities induced by resonant neutrinos ( @xmath234 ) on a non - relativistic plasma .",
    "we compared the calculated damping ( growth ) rate of the plasma waves with the phase space occupied by the neutrino flux and concluded that the angular dispersion of the neutrino velocity due to the finite size of the neutrinosphere exceeds by far the assumed resonance width , at least a factor of @xmath235  even in the case of the most optimistic growth rate , no matter how large is the distance to the neutrinosphere .",
    "this is of course due to the severe weakness of the neutrino interactions . as a consequence no hydrodynamic",
    "( reactive ) instabilities can be induced by neutrinos .",
    "what is left is just neutrino landau damping , a linear effect proportional to @xmath120 .",
    "the corresponding growth rates are however too small for the time duration of neutrino emission in supernovae @xcite . in addition",
    "they are overcame by either collisional damping in a non - relativistic plasma or by electron landau damping in a relativistic one . in conclusion , wave instabilities induced by neutrinos do not seem to be a viable mechanism of substantial energy transfer from neutrinos to a supernova plasma .",
