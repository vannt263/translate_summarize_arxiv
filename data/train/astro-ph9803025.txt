    "the 48  ms radio pulsar psr  b1259@xmath063 is in a highly eccentric 3.4  yr orbit with a be star ( johnston et al .",
    "1992 ) . near periastron ,",
    "for a sufficiently strong be star wind , psr  b1259@xmath063 could possibly make a transition to an accretion regime , exhibiting x - ray pulsations of luminosity @xmath210@xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "_ asca _ x - ray observations at three epochs around the 1994 periastron passage ( kaspi et al .",
    "1994 ; hirayama 1996 ) found the source to be unpulsed , with modest luminosity @xmath110@xmath5  erg  s@xmath4 , for a distance of 2  kpc .",
    "these properties imply that shock emission produces the observed x - rays , rather than accretion ( tavani & arons 1997 ) .",
    "however radio timing observations suggested sudden , brief accretion events near periastron that could not be ruled out by the x - ray observations ( manchester et al .",
    "indeed the pulsar s anomalously low period suggests it may have undergone occasional accretion episodes in the past .",
    "_ asca _ observations during the 1997 periastron passage were impossible due to solar constraints .",
    "the asm on _ rxte _ has been observing bright celestial x - ray sources regularly since early 1996 .",
    "the instrument consists of three `` scanning shadow cameras , '' each containing a position - sensitive proportional counter that is mounted below a wide - field collimator , covered by a coded mask .",
    "the instrument provides roughly 5 celestial scans per day , with diminished exposure in directions toward the sun .",
    "further information on the asm is given by levine et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . while psr  b1259@xmath063 is not routinely monitored for the asm source - history database , we extracted an x - ray light curve as an archival analysis project using standard techniques .",
    "the derived light curve ( figure  1a ) covers the time interval of mjd 5017850762 ( 1996 apr 5 to 1997 nov 10 ) .",
    "the overall mean intensity of psr b1259@xmath063 during this time interval was @xmath6  erg  s@xmath4  @xmath7 at 210 kev .",
    "this result is given with consideration of both the systematic bias and uncertainty in the asm light curves for faint , yet fairly isolated x - ray sources .",
    "figure  1b shows @xmath8 upper limits obtained in the periastron vicinity in 2-day averages .",
    "it shows that in the 2 weeks following periastron , the source was not observed to be brighter than @xmath110 times the 1994 periastron luminosity .",
    "the @xmath8 upper limits to the x - ray emission from psr  b1259@xmath063 from the asm thus argue that the pulsar did not undergo even brief episodes of accretion during the 1997 periastron passage .",
    "this is consistent with the shock emission model , as well as with new conclusions based on timing that rule out the sudden `` spin - ups '' that were claimed previously ( wex et al . 1998 ) .",
