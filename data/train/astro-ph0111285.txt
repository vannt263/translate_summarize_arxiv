    "the galaxy cluster mass function is the most fundamental statistic of the galaxy cluster population .",
    "it is determined by the initial conditions of the mass distribution set in the early universe in a relatively straightforward way , since the evolution of the large - scale matter distribution on scales comparable to the size of clusters and larger is linear and since the formation of clusters is governed by essentially only gravitational processes . choosing a specific cosmological scenario",
    "provides definitive predictions about these initial conditions in a statistical sense .",
    "the overall process of the gravitational growth of the density fluctuations and the development of gravitational instabilities leading to cluster formation is comparatively easy to understand .",
    "it has been well described by analytical models ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and simulated in numerical gravitational @xmath8-body calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . even though the slight deviations from the theoretical prescription found in recent simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) seem to require further refinement in the theoretical framework , these deviations are too small to be significant for the current investigation , as will be shown later . for the precision needed here",
    "these large simulations therefore support the validity of the model predictions . within this framework",
    "the observed cluster mass function provides the opportunity to test different cosmological models .",
    "the tests are particularly sensitive to the amplitude of the cosmic matter density fluctuations ( at a scale of the order of 10mpc ) as well as the normalized total matter density , @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to its importance in testing cosmological models the integral of the mass function yields the interesting information on the fractional amount of matter contained in gravitationally bound large - scale structures .",
    "using one of the first attempts to construct a mass function over the mass range from giant ellipticals to massive clusters by @xcite @xcite obtain a mass fraction @xmath10 for @xmath11 ( where the mass fraction is expressed here in units of the critical density of the universe , @xmath12 ) .",
    "this result is already close to the total matter density in some of the proposed cosmological scenarios .",
    "therefore a precise observational determination of the integral mass function is a very important task for astronomy .",
    "unfortunately the galaxy cluster mass is not an easily and directly observable quantity ( except for measurements of the gravitational lensing effect of clusters which may play a large role in the construction of mass functions in the future ) and one has to resort to the observation of other cluster parameters from which the cluster masses can be deduced .",
    "x - ray astronomy has provided an ideal tool to first detect and select massive clusters by measuring their x - ray luminosity and to secondly perform mass determinations on individual clusters through x - ray imaging and x - ray spectroscopy .    in this paper",
    "we report the first rigorous application of these two approaches for the construction of the cluster mass function .",
    "building on the rosat  all - sky x - ray survey ( rass ) @xcite , which has been well studied in the search of the brightest galaxy clusters through several survey projects ( see refs in sect .",
    "[ sample ] ) , we have compiled a new , highly complete sample of the x - ray brightest galaxy clusters ( hiflugcs , the highest x - ray flux galaxy cluster sample ) .",
    "thanks to the numerous detailed galaxy cluster observations performed with the rosat  and asca  @xcite satellite observatories and accumulated in the archives we can perform a detailed mass determination for most of these clusters and obtain a good mass estimate for the few remaining objects . from these data we first establish a ( tight ) correlation of the measured x - ray luminosity and the cluster mass .",
    "this relation assures that we have essentially sampled the most massive clusters in the nearby universe , which forms the basis of the construction of the cluster mass function .",
    "previous local galaxy cluster mass functions have been derived by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and ( * ? ? ? * for galaxy groups ) .",
    "@xcite used the galaxy richness to relate to cluster masses for optical observations and an x - ray temperature  mass relation to convert the temperature function given by @xcite to a mass function .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite used velocity dispersions for optically selected samples to determine the mass function .",
    "here we use a different approach and construct the first mass function for x - ray selected galaxy clusters based on the rass  using individually determined cluster masses .",
    "the mass function of this cluster sample is then used to determine the mass fraction in bound objects with masses above a minimum mass and to derive tight constraints on cosmological scenarios .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "is used if not stated otherwise ( present day quantities ) .",
    "we note that the determination of physical cluster parameters has a negligible dependence on @xmath9 and @xmath18 for the small redshift range used here , as will be shown later .",
    "therefore it is justified to determine the parameters for an einstein  de sitter model but to discuss the results also in the context of other models .",
    "the mass function measures the cluster number density as a function of mass .",
    "therefore any cluster fulfilling the selection criteria and not included in the sample distorts the result systematically .",
    "it is then obvious that for the construction of the mass function it is vital to use a homogeneously selected and highly complete sample of objects , and additionally the selection must be closely related to cluster mass . in this work",
    "the rass , where one single instrument has surveyed the whole sky , has been chosen as the basis for the sample construction .",
    "using the x - ray emission from the hot intracluster medium for cluster selection minimizes projection effects and the tight correlation between x - ray luminosity and gravitational mass convincingly demonstrates that x - ray cluster surveys have the important property of being mass selective ( sect .",

    "relations for the flux - limited sample have been used to get the best mass estimate for the cluster luminosities included in hiflugcs .",
    "mass functions for the two extreme relations ( @xmath978 ) with @xmath979 and ( @xmath980 ) with @xmath981 are shown in fig .",
    "[ mf_lm ] .",
    "first of all one notes the fairly good agreement between the three mass functions . in detail",
    "the differences between the two mass functions estimated from different luminosity  mass relations can be understood by considering that at the low luminosity end the steeper relation predicts a higher mass for a given luminosity than the shallower relation , resulting in a shift towards higher masses of the mass function . at the high mass side",
    "the effect is opposite , resulting in a shift towards lower masses for the steeper relation . on average the points for the steeper relation lie higher which is caused by the fact that a steeper relation results in a smaller @xmath1174 on average , which gives rise to an increased @xmath982 .",
    "the differences to the mass function calculated using the measured masses are again understood by a similar comparison and are partially caused by a possible deviation of the shape of the @xmath38@xmath192 relation from a pure power law . despite these small differences performing an actual fit for the two relations ( @xmath980 ) and ( @xmath978 ) , @xmath1175 and @xmath1176 , respectively ( tab .",
    "[ tab : scat ] ) , has replaced the mass measurement error , @xmath1177 , in ( [ eq : nschl ] ) . ] results in the ( @xmath9 , @xmath1042 ) values ( 0.14 , 0.85 ) for ( @xmath980 ) and ( 0.22 , 0.74 ) for ( @xmath978 ) . the first case is consistent with the error range given in ( [ eq : omres ] ) and in the second case the 90% statistical error ellipse overlaps with the 90% ellipse in fig .",
    "[ banana ] . from the above and fig .",
    "[ ps0 ] it is clear that using steeper luminosity  mass relations results in higher values for @xmath9 and lower values for @xmath1042 . here we want to estimate @xmath1033 from @xmath1081 and therefore ( @xmath978 ) is the appropriate relation to use .",
    "this test shows that with a comparatively easy to obtain x - ray luminosity function of a statistical cluster sample and with the knowledge of the empirical @xmath38@xmath192 relation ( even if approximated as simple power law ) and its scatter as presented here useful constraints on cosmological parameters can be set by construction of a ` quasi mass function ' .      to estimate the fraction of the gravitational mass density relative to the critical density contained in galaxy clusters , @xmath1178 , the individual cluster masses divided by the corresponding maximum search volumes",
    "have been summed up for hiflugcs , i.e. , @xmath1179 .",
    "note that the determination of @xmath1180 is independent of the hubble constant .",
    "the cumulative diagram for @xmath1181 is shown in fig .",
    "[ mdens ] . in order to perform a conservative error estimate ,",
    "hiflugcs  has been split into two parts with @xmath1182 and @xmath1183 , and the results for these subsamples are also shown in the figure .",
    "this estimate is conservative because hiflugcs  is about twice as large as each subsample .",
    "taking the second and third lowest mass clusters together with the maximum mass range given by their individual uncertainties , we obtain @xmath1184 for masses larger than @xmath7 , i.e. , the total gravitating mass contained within the virial radius of clusters amounts only to @xmath1185 percent of the total mass in a critical density universe .",
    "combined with our best estimate @xmath1135 this implies that about 90% of the total mass in the universe resides outside virialized cluster regions above the given minimum mass .",
    "if galaxies trace mass it also follows that by far most of the galaxies do not sit in clusters .",
    "this result is consistent with the general presumption that clusters are rare objects , rare peaks in the density distribution field .    comparing the diagram to the mass fraction @xmath1186 in clusters with masses larger than @xmath1187 given by @xcite , based on the mass function determined by @xcite ,",
    "one finds that their estimate is a factor 45 higher .",
    "however , the @xcite mass function is given for @xmath1030 and we get a consistent result if we calculate @xmath1180 using our formally determined cluster masses within @xmath209 .",
    "it needs to be pointed out that at @xmath1188 we find that the typical virial radius is @xmath1189 and a mass determination at @xmath1190 based on the assumption of virial equilibrium may therefore be rather uncertain and possibly leading to overestimates of @xmath1180 .",
    "this becomes more crucial if mass functions for @xmath1030 are extrapolated even down to galaxy masses .",
    "this way @xcite find @xmath1191 within the mass range @xmath1192@xmath1187 , which , compared to our results from the previous section , would account already for almost all mass in the universe .",
    "an x - ray selected and x - ray flux - limited sample comprising the 63 x - ray brightest galaxy clusters in the sky ( excluding the galactic band , called hiflugcs ) has been constructed based on the rosat  all - sky survey .",
    "the flux limit has been set at @xmath1193 in the energy band @xmath78 .",
    "it has been shown that a high completeness is indicated by several tests . due to the high flux limit",
    "this sample can be used for a variety of applications requiring a statistical cluster sample without any corrections to the effective survey volume .",
    "mainly high quality pointed observations have been used to determine fluxes and physical cluster parameters .",
    "it has been shown that a tight correlation exists between the x - ray luminosity and the gravitational mass using hiflugcs  and an extended sample of 106 galaxy clusters .",
    "the relation and its scatter have been quantified using different fitting methods .",
    "a comparison to theoretical and numerical predictions shows an overall agreement .",
    "this relation may be directly applied in large x - ray cluster surveys or dark matter simulations for conversions between x - ray luminosity and gravitating mass .    using hiflugcs",
    "the gravitational mass function has been determined for the mass interval @xmath1194 .",
    "comparison with press ",
    "schechter mass functions assuming cdm power spectra has yielded tight constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the large covered mass range has allowed to put constraints on relevant parameters individually .",
    "specifically we have found @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( 90% c.l .  statistical uncertainty ) .",
    "various tests for systematic uncertainties have been performed , including comparison of the press ",
    "schechter mass function with the most recent results from large @xmath8-body simulations , almost always yielding uncertainties smaller than the statistical uncertainties .",
    "combining all identified systematic uncertainties in a worst case scenario results in an upper limit @xmath4 . for comparison",
    "we have also determined the best fit @xmath9 values for fixed @xmath1042 values yielding the relation @xmath5 .",
    "the mass function has been integrated to obtain the fraction of the total gravitating mass in the universe contained in galaxy clusters .",
    "normalized to the critical density we have found @xmath6 for cluster masses larger than @xmath7 . with the value for @xmath9 determined here",
