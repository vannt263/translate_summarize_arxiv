    "from current observational data @xcite , it is now widely accepted that the universe is undergoing a state of acceleration . the simplest setup to describe this acceleration is by means of a cosmological constant , with an equation of state @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the pressure and @xmath2 is the energy density of such a cosmological constant .",
    "there are , however , other candidates that astronomical observations still allow .",
    "namely , a dark energy component @xcite whose equation of state parameter , @xmath3 , is very close to @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is the ratio between the pressure of dark energy , @xmath5 , and its energy density @xmath6 .",
    "the relevance of this point is that dark energy can lead to quite different scenarios concerning the future of the universe . to be more precise : if @xmath7 , dark energy corresponds to a quintessence fluid @xcite ; if @xmath8 , it is a cosmological constant and the universe would be asymptotically de sitter ; if @xmath9 , dark energy corresponds to a `` phantom '' content @xcite .    in the context of dark energy cosmology , the study of gravitational theories that entail spacetime singularities at late - times has made a considerable progress in the last years .",
    "being more specific , the following cases have been established within a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) framework @xcite :    * big rip singularity - a singularity at a finite cosmic time where the scale factor , the hubble rate and its cosmic time derivative diverge . @xcite ; * sudden singularity - a singularity at a finite scale factor and in a finite cosmic time where the hubble rate is finite but its cosmic time derivative diverges @xcite ; * big freeze singularity - a singularity at a finite scale factor and in a finite cosmic time where the hubble rate and its cosmic time derivative diverge @xcite ; * type iv singularity - a singularity at a finite scale factor and in a finite cosmic time where the hubble rate and its cosmic derivative are finite but higher derivative of the hubble rate diverges .",
    "these singularities can appear in the framework of modified theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it has become of interest to determine under which conditions any of the above singularities can be removed , or at least appeased in some manner . a significant range of approaches and corresponding results have been contributed to the literature @xcite . our purpose in this paper is to participate in that line of investigation , namely addressing the following question : since the big rip singularity occurs at high energy _ and _ in the future , could we expect that a combination of ir and uv effects removes or replaces it ? to this aim , we employ in this paper a dvali - gabadadze - porrati brane - world ( dgp ) model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , that includes a phantom matter fluid ( that emulates the dark energy dynamics ) , where the five - dimensional bulk is characterized by a gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term . generally speaking , within a dgp brane component , we have a setting where infra - red ( ir ) effects modify general relativity at late - time , whereas with the gb ingredient , ultra - violet effects are present for high - energy scales @xcite .    before proceeding into a more technical discussion ,",
    "it could be of interest to further add the following about having a phantom matter fluid for the brane .",
    "on the one hand , dark energy component with @xmath9 , i.e. a phantom energy component has not yet been excluded by the recent results of wmap5 .",
    "for example , the wmap5 data ( in combination with other data ) for a standard flrw universe with spatially flat sections , filled with cold dark matter and a dark energy component with a constant equation of state parameter , @xmath3 , predicts @xmath10 for cmb , snia and bao data which gives the most stringent limit , while wmap data alone predicts for this model @xmath11 . for more details , see @xcite . on the other hand , to investigate future singularities , a perfect fluid is satisfactory and therefore we have not given an explicit action for the phantom matter in terms of a minimally coupled scalar field ( with the opposite kinetical term ) or through more general scalar field actions like a k - essence action ( see section ii ) .",
    "let us also add that it is well known that the dgp brane has a branch with an unstable mode solution ( i.e. , a ` ghost ' ) @xcite .",
    "it may therefore be questionable why to initiate a study within a dgp setting or even insert phantom matter .",
    "our point is that , in spite of these open lines , the features characterizing the dgp as well as gb elements can provide a framework to investigate the intertwining of late time dynamics and high energy effects .",
    "an interesting ground to test it is with a phantom fluid , since this matter in a standard flrw setting induces a big rip singularity .",
    "eventually , the unresolved issues for the dgp brane will be eliminated and results such as the one we bring here will increase in interest .    this paper is then organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we describe our dgp - gb model filled with matter and a phantom fluid and present the analytical solutions . in sect .",
    "iii , we analyze how the big rip is replaced by a sudden singularity . finally , we summarize our work in sect .",
    "iv , presenting also some possible lines to subsequently investigate .",
    "the generalized friedmann equation of a spatially flat dgp brane with a gb term in a minkowski bulk can be written as @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gb parameter , @xmath14 is the five - dimensional gravitational constant and @xmath15 is the crossover scale .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 stands for the total energy density of the brane .",
    "therefore , for a late - time evolving brane the energy density is well described by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 corresponds to the energy density of baryons , cold dark matter and dark energy , respectively . as @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "are both proportional to @xmath20 , we will define their sum as @xmath21 ; i.e. @xmath22 . on the other hand",

    "the singularity emerges in @xmath143 gyr . on the whole , although the universe would meet a `` less severe '' singularity in the future , this would happen much sooner that for the big rip case . in @xcite , there are a few predictions concerning possible astronomical events that would indicate the emergence of the singularity herein exposed . within our model ,",
    "some of those events or other of similar impact could occur rather earlier .",
    "( in dimensionless units ) , for fixed values of @xmath126 , @xmath144 and @xmath128 with respect to the equation of state parameter @xmath3 . ]",
    "the study of singularities occurring in the future is a subject of interest and several proposals for their removal or substitution have been advanced @xcite . in this paper , we have considered a specific case and investigated whether a composition of specific ir and uv effects could alter a big rip singularity setting .",
    "more concretely , we employed a simple model : a dgp brane model , with phantom matter and a gb term for the bulk .",
    "the dgp brane configuration has relevant ir effects , whereas the gb component is important for high energies ; phantom matter in a standard flrw model is known to induce the emergence of big rip singularities @xcite .",
    "our analysis indicates that the big rip can be replaced by a sudden future singularity , through some intertwining between late - time dynamics and high energy effects .",
    "subsequently , we determine values of the redshift and cosmic time , before the brane reaches the sudden singularity . these results can be contrasted with those , e.g. , in @xcite for the big rip occurrence in a flrw setting .",
    "we are aware that the herein conclusions are based in a rather particular result , that was extracted from a specific model",
    ". subsequent research work would assist in clarifying some remaining issues .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to further study if and how other singularities can be appeased or removed by means of the herein combined ir and uv effects . on the other hand",
    ", it might be interesting to consider a modified hilbert - einstein action on the brane , which in addition could alleviate the ghost problem present on the self - accelerating dgp model by self - accelerating the normal dgp branch @xcite , and see if some of the dark energy singularities can be removed or at least appeased in this setup .",
