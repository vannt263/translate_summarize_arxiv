    "the astonishingly high energy of their almost instantenous @xmath4-ray emission makes gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) one of the most ( if not the most ) energetic astrophysical phenomena .",
    "moreover , thanks to their high luminosity , grbs are visible up to very high redshift thus attracting a lot of interest for a potential application to trace the hubble diagram deep into the matter dominated era . to this end , a lot of work has been devoted to finding and characterizing scaling relations among observables redshift independent quantities ( e.g. , the time duration ) and distance dependent ones ( such as the isotropic luminosity and energy ) so that the hubble diagram can be inferred .",
    "although significant steps forward have been done with the discovery of different 2d correlations , the remarkable scatter affecting them and the uncertainties on their physical interpretation makes this issue still open and strongly debated .",
    "it is worth noting that all the 2d relations investigated so far have been first discovered examining a relatively small number of objects .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the main aim of later analyses has been to add grbs to the fitted samples in order to both strengthen the significance of the correlation and ameliorate the statistics .",
    "the recent availability of the swift and fermi satellites have , however , changed this situation greatly increasing the total number of grbs and hence the ones usable for the analysis of different scaling laws of interest .",
    "it is therefore possible now to deepen the investigation by separating grbs in different classes according to their observable properties .",
    "the importance of a correct partitioning of astronomical objects in homogenous groups can be easily understood considering the textbook example of the cepheids variables and the estimate of the hubble constant @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , the first @xmath5 determinations based on a mixed sample of cepheids and rr lyrae variables were grossly wrong because of the use of the same period - luminosity relation for two radically different stellar objects .",
    "another instructive example is represented by supernovae .",
    "indeed , no scaling relations can be found if one considers the full sample , but this becomes possible if one separates the type ia class sne from the other ones .",
    "motivated by these examples , we investigate here the impact of partitioning grbs in homogenous classes on the slope and scatter of the popular amati relation .",
    "actually , defining homogenous classes of grbs is far from trivial . as in every classification analysis",
    ", one has first to decide which are the criteria to use . put in other words , one should decide how to separate a multidimensional parameter space in disjoint regions .",
    "two alternative and somewhat complementary choices are possible . on one hand , one can start from a ( sometimes a priori ) theoretical interpretation of the classification .",
    "for instance , it was the vague ( and later found to be wrong ) idea that spiral galaxies represent different possible evolutionary stages of elliptical ones which leads hubble to formulate its tuning fork diagram . on the contrary",
    ", one can start from some observable properties ( such as , e.g. , the period - luminosity relations for variable stars or the presence or lack of some chemical elements in the supernova spectrum ) to work out a classification .",
    "ideally , the two approaches should converge with theory leading to classes with well distinct observational properties and observations suggesting theoretical interpretation of the physical phenomena underlying the empirical partitioning .",
    "unfortunately , notwithstanding the large number of grbs nowadays available , classification of grbs is still in its infancy .",
    "usually , one adopts a very rough classification dividing grbs in short ( with @xmath6 ) and long @xmath7 bursts where @xmath8 is a typical time duration ( better defined later ) .",
    "indeed , the @xmath8 distribution clearly shows two distinct peaks thus suggesting that different physical phenomena are taking place for the two families .",
    "theoretically , long bursts are associated to supernova explosion so that @xmath8 is determined by the time needed for the dynamical collapse of the exploding star .",
    "as such , one expects to detect long bursts in starburst regions and to find a supernova when following up the grbs in optical bands .",
    "in contrast , the merger of two neutron stars may be the origin of short bursts since such a merging takes place on short timescale .",
    "there are nevertheless other possible physical origins for grbs such as the merger of a neutron star with a white dwarf that should lead to an intermediate class .",
    "moreover , it is not unusual to find long bursts with no associated supernova thus suggesting that a clear cut separation in only two families is too restrictive and possibly misleading .    a pioneering step forward along the road to classify grbs in more",
    "than one family has been taken by @xcite . using two different multivariate clustering techniques ,",
    "namely the k - means partitioning method and the dirichlet process of mixture modeling , applied to the batse grb catalog @xcite , @xcite found that the optimal number of classes is three in agreement with a theoretical speculation interpreting the three classes as coming out from mergers of neutron star systems , mergers between white dwarfs and neutron stars , and collapse of massive stars .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that @xcite have used the full batse sample notwithstanding the availability of redshift . as a consequence",
    ", they could not correct the observed quantities to the grb rest frame so that their classification is not based on the intrinsic grbs properties , but only on their apparent ones . as a further step on ,",
    "we revisit here the issue of partitioning grbs improving the analysis in two aspects .",
    "first , we rely on grbs with known @xmath0 so that we can deal with rest frame quantities which are more intimately related to the grb physics .",
    "second , we resort to cladistics to separate grbs in distinct families taking into account a large parameter space .",
    "cladistics has been developed to seek for evolutionary relationship among objects so that is particularly well suited for our aims offering the possibility to work out classes populated by grbs with homogenous properties .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "sect.2 gives a short introduction to cladistics also explaining why we believe this can be a valuable help in addressing the problem of grbs classification .",
    "the grbs sample and the parameters used as input to the analysis are described in sect.3 where we provide some qualitative interpretation of the resulting families . as an application , we examine in sect.4 how the slope and the scatter of two popular scaling relations depend on the particular grbs class used as input to the fitting procedure showing the importance of a preliminary separation of grbs in homogenous subsamples to avoid biasing such relations .",
    "a summary of the results is finally given in sect.5 .",
    "cladistics belongs to the phylogenetic methods , designed to build a graph representing the evolutionary relationships between species of objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "each node of the graph indicates a transmission with modification mechanism that creates two or more species inheriting from a common ancestor .",
    "cladistics is a non - parametric parameter - based method also called the maximum parsimony method @xcite .",
    "there is no assumption about the metrics of the parameter space .",
    "the principle of cladistics is relatively simple : two ( or more ) objects are related if they share a common history , that is they possess properties inherited from a common ancestor .",
    "the parameters ( called _ characters _ ) are traits , descriptors , observables , or properties , which can be assigned at least two states characterising the evolutionary stage of the objects for that parameter .",
    "the maximum parsimony algorithm looks for the simplest arrangement of objects on a bifurcating tree .",
    "the complexity of the arrangement is measured by the total number of _ steps _ ( i.e. changes in all parameter states ) along the tree .",
    "the simplest tree supposedly depicts the simplest evolutionary scenario .",
    "cladistics has been mainly developed to build phylogenies of living organisms and is well adapted to the diversification by replication .",
    "more generally , cladistics can be used when diversity is generated through some transmission - with - modification mechanism , ideally presenting a branching pattern .",
    "cladistics can take uncertainties into account .",
    "this is an invaluable capability that is rather rare among clustering methods .",
    "the implementation is very simple since it suffices for each parameter to be given a range of values instead of a single value .",
    "the algorithm then evaluates the different possibilities allowed by the range of values and select among them the one that provides the most parsimonious tree . in the same way ,",
    "undocumented parameters can be included , and the most parsimonious diversification scenario provides a prediction for the unknown values .",
    "the idea behind astrocladistics , initially implemented for galaxies @xcite is that the evolution of astrophysical objects is most often a transformation , which is nothing else than a transmission with modification . for galaxies",
    "this occurs when they are transformed through assembling , internal evolution , interaction , merger or stripping @xcite . for each transformation event ,",
    "stars , gas and dust are transmitted to the new object with some modification of their properties .",
    "the globular clusters can be seen as simple forms of galaxies , without interaction .",
    "their properties and their evolution depend mainly on the environment in which they form .",
    "since this environment evolves itself ( evolution of the universe and the dynamical environment of the parent galaxy ) , the basic properties of different clusters are related to each other by some evolutionary pattern . in particular , the dust and gas from which the stars of the globular clusters form have been `` polluted '' ( enriched in heavy elements ) by more ancient stars , being field stars or belonging to other globular clusters .",
    "this results in a kind of transmission with modification process , which justifies a priori the use of cladistics on globular clusters , as confirmed in @xcite .    the specific concept behind cladistics that justifies its application to other astrophysical entities such as grbs may be more easily understood in the case of stars ( fraix - burnet & thuillard , a&a , submitted ) .",
    "a single star with a given mass and metallicity evolves along a well - defined trajectory usually represented in the herztsprung - russell diagram that plots the luminosity versus the temperature .",
    "all stars with the same mass and metallicity follow the same evolutionary path , and we can see these stars as belonging to a same lineage or family .",
    "several such lineages create a graph , with branches connecting at the main sequence .",
    "it is thus quite natural to use classification methods that are designed to build graphs .",
    "cladistics , being non - parametric and parameter based , is the most general and powerful of them thus emerging as the most suitable choice .",
    "we may expect grbs , as well as many other astrophysical objects , to obey more or less the same rule : from a given state , they evolve along a path that is characterized by the properties of the lineage at the initial state . hence , provided we have enough objects to sample the evolutionary paths of the lineages , and assuming the available parameters ( observables ) contain enough information to distinguish a few lineages , cladistics seems to be an adequate tool to use .",
    "the important consequence for our study of grbs is that since the objects within each family are by construction , homologous , it is reasonable to expect the dispersion in the scaling relations to be reduced .    in the present study , we have performed a cladistic analysis in the same way as done in several previous papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : each parameter is discretized into 30 equal - width bins , which play the role of discrete evolutionary states .",
    "we have taken into account the measurement errors available for @xmath9 , @xmath10  and @xmath11 as ranges of possible values ( see above ) .",
    "the search for the maximum parsimony trees are performed using the heuristic algorithm implemented in the paup*4.0b10 @xcite package , with the ratchet method @xcite .",
    "the cladistics approach described above allows us to separate grbs in classes according to a set of properties used to generate the most parsimonious * tree*. the members of a class share similar properties ( likely related to their formation and evolutionary process ) thus representing a homogenous population . partitioning grbs using cladistics",
    "therefore offers the possibility to both infer constraints on the grbs physics and investigating whether the slope and the scatter of empirical 2d scaling relations depend on the grb status . to this end , we here first briefly describe the input data and then show the results of the cladistics analysis .      in order to avoid any possible systematics related to merging data from different sources , we only rely on grbs observed by the _",
    "swift _ satellite ( @xcite ) retrieving their data from the online archive .",
    "since we need rest frame and intrinsic quantities , we search for grbs with measured @xmath0 which reduces the full sample to 216 objects .",
    "we then select grbs with measured values of the quantities listed below .",
    "* @xmath8 : the time ( in @xmath12 ) over which the burst emits from @xmath13 to @xmath14 of its total measured counts ; * @xmath15 : the fluence ( in @xmath16 ) measured over the energy range @xmath17 ; * @xmath18 : the peak phothon flux ( in @xmath19 ) over the same energy range ; * @xmath20 : the xrt early flux ( in @xmath21 ) measured over the energy range @xmath22 ; * @xmath4 : the spectral index , i.e. , the slope of the x - ray power spectrum approximated as a power - law . * @xmath23 : the column density of the circumburst material .    not all of these quantities can be directly used as input to the cladistics analysis since they are observable rather than intrinsic grb properties . to this end",

    "similarly , we do not use the observed peak flux @xmath18 , but the isotropic luminosity given by ( @xcite )    @xmath32    where the bolometric peak flux reads    @xmath33    in order to evaluate @xmath34 , we need to model the grb spectrum @xmath30 over the @xmath35 range . as a first approximation , one could set @xmath36 and rely on the @xmath37 values reported in the online swift archive . actually , most grb spectra are better approximated by the @xcite function    @xmath38 } } & \\displaystyle{e \\le \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha - \\beta}{2 + \\alpha } \\right ) e } \\\\",

    ", it is not always possible to determine @xmath39 so that ( following , e.g. , @xcite ) we set @xmath42 if this latter is not available .",
    "we match our grbs list with the grb spectral catalog compiled by l. amati ( private communication , see also @xcite ) thus finding spectral parameters for 90 out of 216 objects . for the remaining ones , we follow the swift archive assuming that a power - law approximation is a reliable description of the spectrum and fixing the slope @xmath37 to the online value .",
    "since the spectrum is likely related to the grb physics , it is interesting to include in the cladistics analysis a quantity related to its profile .",
    "this is provided by the _ hardness ratio _ which we compute as :    @xmath43    thus quantifying in which energy range the grbs emits most of its photons .    in order to deal with rest frame quantities only , we convert the observed luminosity x - ray flux @xmath20 into the corresponding luminosity @xmath44 assuming a @xmath45 which represents an excellent approximation for the spectrum over the @xmath46 band .",

    "these are used as input to the cladistics analysis described in the following . as a final comment",
    ", we inform the reader that errors are available only for @xmath48 so that we will test the impact of these uncertainties only on our partitioning procedure .",

    "inverting eq.([eq : defeiso ] ) , one trivially gets :    @xmath49^{1/2 } \\label{eq : dleiso}\\ ] ]    so that one can estimate @xmath26 from the observable grb properties ( namely , the fluence @xmath50 and the spectral parameters ) provided @xmath2 is inferred from the @xmath41-@xmath2 correlation .",
    "should this quantity be biased because of the use of incorrect calibration parameters @xmath51 , the distance @xmath26 will be biased too .",
    "it is only a matter of algebra to show that @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the distance and the estimated energy of the grb at redshift @xmath0 as estimated from the fit to the full sample ( @xmath54 and to the subsample the grb belongs to @xmath55 ) .",
    "actually , for a given @xmath41 , the correlation predicts that the grb isotropic energy @xmath9 follows a normal distribution centred on @xmath56 and with variance set by the intrinsic scatter @xmath57 . in order to take care of the uncertainties on the @xmath51 parameters ,",
    "we estimate @xmath58 as follows . for each point",
    "@xmath51 along the merged chain found during the likelihood analysis , we compute    @xmath59    with @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 a gaussian function with mean and variance given by @xmath63 , respectively . evaluating this quantity for all the points in the chain gives us a histogram which we use to finally estimate the median and @xmath64cl of @xmath2 .",
    "we then take the values thus obtained using the chains for the fit to the full sample and the separate classes subsamples to finally get @xmath65 .",
    "-@xmath2 correlation.,width=283 ]    considering the full sample , we get ( median and @xmath66 and @xmath14cl ) :    @xmath67    showing that the bias on the distance estimate can be quite large and can hardly be neglected .",
    "moreover , as fig.[fig : disttest ] shows , @xmath65 is clearly correlated with @xmath0 , the largest biases taking place just over the redshift range @xmath68 where the interplay between dark energy and matter is most important .",
    "although a likelihood and model dependent analyis is needed to quantify the impact on the cosmological parameters , fig.[fig : disttest ] is a definitive evidence of the need to preliminary partition grbs in homogenous classes before using them to infer a cosmologically relevant hubble diagram .",
    "the hunt for a distance candle able to extend the hubble diagram deep into the matter dominated era have had a renewed boost when scaling relations for grbs became first available .",
    "the first successes were , however , soon frustrated by both theoretical ( such as the difficulties in understanding their physical motivations ) and observational ( e.g. , the role of selection effects ) problems . from the point of view of the hubble diagram , the most disturbing problem is the significant intrinsic scatter affecting these scaling relations which causes large uncertainties on the inferred distance moduli . lacking a definitive interpretation of its origin , we have here investigated whether the scatter may be ( at least in part ) the outcome of forcing a single scaling relation to fit physically different classes of grbs .    to this end",
    ", one must first rely on a robust method to identify which are these classes and to assign a given grb to the correct class based on its rest frame properties .",
    "however , such a task is far to be trivial considering the high dimensionality of the parameter space to be searched for .",
    "cladistics analysis offers a valuable and efficient way to successfully solve this problem .",
    "although it is not possible at the moment to claim which are the physical processes motivating this partitioning of the parameter space , it is worth stressing that all of the grbs in a given class have undergone the same processes thus representing an homogenous class .",
    "they are therefore the ideal inputs to our analysis of how the scaling correlations change with the grbs subsamples used .",
    "we have then considered the @xmath41-@xmath2 and @xmath41-@xmath69 correlations in order to investigate the bias on the calibration parameters @xmath70 and the intrinsic scatter @xmath57 due to fitting all grbs together even if they belong to different classes .",
    "it turns out that @xmath51 from the fit to the full sample are remarkably different from those to the separated homogenous classes .",
    "these latter fits trace distinct regions of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 spaces , while the median fit to the full sample approximately trace the diagonal of the region delimited by the single fits .",
    "although a larger statistics is necessary to confirm these preliminary results , it is intriguing to note that the scatter is indeed reduced .",
    "moreover , using the median fit to the full sample to estimate @xmath34 for a given grb instead of the one for its class introduces a non negligible bias on the inferred luminosity distance .",
    "moreover , such a bias is strongly correlated with the redshift and is larger just over the range most interesting for dark energy studied . quantifying",
    "the impact on the grbs hubble diagram and the cosmological parameters determination is outside our aim here , but worth to be investigated in a forthcoming publication .    as a preliminary analysis",
    ", one should however perform two complementary tests .",
    "first , a larger sample is needed in order to both assess the robustness of the cladistics analysis partitioning and the assignment procedure .",
    "indeed , we have here developed a fast procedure to assign a grb to its corresponding class based on a multi - parameter selection criteria based on the analysis of the sample considered here .",
    "it is important to validate and improve the completeness and purity of this procedure with an independent sample .",
    "this could be quite easy by considering the grbs observed with other instruments or added to the swift catalog after our compilation .",
    "we can first use our procedure to assign them to one classe and then carry on a full cladistics analysis to check whether the assignment is correct or not .",
    "the larger grbs sample also allows us to improve the determination of the scaling relation parameters @xmath51 thus offering the possibility to strengthen our conclusion on the importance of a preliminary class assignment .",
