    "finding the unique smallest enclosing ball ( seb ) of a finite euclidean point set @xmath1 is a fundamental problem that was first posed by  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been thoroughly investigated in the computational geometry community by  @xcite and @xcite , where it is also known as the minimum enclosing ball ( meb ) , the @xmath0-center problem , or the minimax optimization problem in operations research . in practice , since computing the seb exactly is intractable in high dimensions , efficient approximation algorithms have been proposed .",
    "an algorithmic breakthrough was achieved by  @xcite that proved the existence of a _ core - set _",
    "@xmath2 of _ optimal size _",
    "@xmath3 so that @xmath4 ( for any arbitrary @xmath5 ) , where @xmath6 denotes the radius of the seb of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the ball center , i.e. the minimax center .",
    "since the size of the core - set depends _ only _ on the approximation precision @xmath9 and is _ independent _ of the dimension , core - sets have become widely popular in high - dimensional applications such as supervised classification in machine learning ( see for example , the core vector machines of  @xcite ) . in the work of  @xcite , a fast and simple approximation algorithm is designed as follows :    it can be proved that a @xmath10-approximation of the seb is obtained after @xmath11 iterations , thereby showing the existence of a core - set @xmath12 of a size at most @xmath11 : @xmath4 .",
    "this simple algorithm runs in time @xmath13 , and has been generalized to bregman divergences by  @xcite which include the ( squared ) euclidean distance , and are the canonical distances of dually flat spaces , including the particular case of self - dual euclidean geometry .",
    "( note that if we start from the optimal center @xmath14 , the first iteration yields a center @xmath15 away from @xmath8 but it will converge in the long run to @xmath8 . ) @xcite proved the existence of optimal @xmath9-core - set of size @xmath16 . since finding tight core - sets requires as a black box primitive the computation of the exact smallest enclosing balls of small - size point sets , we rather consider the riemmanian generalization of the bc - alg , although that even in the euclidean case it does not deliver optimal size core - sets .",
    "many data - sets arising in medical imaging ( see  @xcite ) or in computer vision ( refer to  @xcite ) can not be considered as emanating from vectorial spaces but rather as lying on curved manifolds .",
    "for example , the space of rotations or the space of invertible matrices are not flat , as the arithmetic average of two elements does not necessarily lie inside the space .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the euclidean bc - alg algorithm to riemannian geometry . in the remainder , we assume the reader familiar with basic notions of riemannian geometry ( see  @xcite for an introductory textbook ) in order not to burden the paper with technical riemannian definitions .",
    "however in the appendix , we recall some specific notions which play a key role in the paper , such as geodesics , sectional curvature , injectivity radius , alexandrov and toponogov theorems , and cosine laws for triangles . furthermore , we consider probability measures instead of finite point sets so as to study the most general setting .",
