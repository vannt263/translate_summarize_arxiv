    "some spectroscopic surveys of ly@xmath12 emission line at @xmath34 have been performed , but all failed @xcite , probably because of heavy absorption by intergalactic neutral hydrogen before the completion of the cosmic reionization .",

    "such a sandwich geometry is favored to explain the observed relation between the uv color and the infrared - to - uv flux ratio of nearby galaxies @xcite . in addition",

    "the escape probability @xmath55 is saturated at @xmath60 when @xmath61 .",
    "we calibrate @xmath62 and @xmath57 so as to reproduce the observed uv luminosity function ( lf ) at @xmath13 , and we keep these values even at higher redshifts . for the cosmological simulation in this study ,",

    "we also apply the igm absorption for the blue side of @xmath67 following @xcite with an extrapolation for @xmath0 , which should not cause a significant uncertainty because the spectrum below ly@xmath12 is completely damped by the igm absorption for such high - redshifts .",

    "let us assume a functional form as @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the fitting parameters .",
    "if @xmath105 is equal to @xmath106 , then the uv luminosity is linearly proportional to the host halo ( or stellar ) mass . for the mock - udf12 galaxies , we have obtained @xmath107 for the halo mass relation and @xmath108 for the stellar mass relation",
    "therefore , the uv luminosity is almost linearly proportional to the halo mass for the mock - udf12 galaxies , but the stellar mass scales more strongly with the magnitude . using equation  ( [ eq : mhalo - muv ] ) and ( [ eq : mstellar - muv ] ) ,",

    "<S> we have performed a large cosmological hydrodynamics simulation tailored to the deep survey with the hubble space telescope made in 2012 , the so - called udf12 campaign . after making a light - cone output , </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the same color selection criteria as the udf12 campaign to select galaxies from our simulation , and then , have examined the physical properties of them as a proxy of the real observed udf12 galaxies at @xmath0 . as a result , we find that the halo mass is almost linearly proportional to the observed ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity ( @xmath1 at @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dust attenuation and uv slope @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> well correlates with the observed uv luminosity , which is consistent with observations quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> the star formation rate ( sfr ) is also linearly proportional to the stellar mass and the specific sfr shows only a weak dependency on the mass . </S>",
    "<S> we also find an increasing star formation history with a time - scale of @xmath4 myr in the high-@xmath5 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> an average metallicity weighted by the lyman continuum luminosity reaches up to @xmath6 solar even at @xmath7 , suggesting a rapid metal enrichment . </S>",
    "<S> we also expect @xmath8 mjy at 350 ghz of the dust thermal emission from the galaxies with @xmath9 , which can be detectable with the atacama large milimetre - submilimetre array . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies selected by the udf12 survey contribute to only 5212% of the cosmic sfr density from @xmath10 to @xmath7 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the james webb space telescope will push the detection fraction up to 7772% .    [ firstpage ]    cosmology  observations ; galaxies  evolution ; galaxies  formation ; galaxies  high - redshift ; galaxies  luminosity function , mass function ; </S>"
