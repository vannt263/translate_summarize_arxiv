    "the discovery of an anti - correlation between the equivalent width ( ew ) of c iv  @xmath11549 emission line and the continuum luminosity measured at 1450  in quasar rest frame , known as the baldwin effect , was first made by baldwin ( 1977 ) ( e.g. see a review by shields 2006 ) .",

    "several interpretations about the origin of baldwin effect have been proposed .",
    "it is not clear whether the baldwin effect is driven by the underlying physical parameters , such as the redshift , eigenvector 1 of boroson & green ( 1992 ) , the eddington ratio ( i.e. the ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the eddington luminosity ) , the mass of supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , the gas metallically ( e.g. dietrich et al . 2002 ; shang et al . 2003 ; sulentic et al . 2007 ; baskin & laor , 2004 ; bachev et al .",
