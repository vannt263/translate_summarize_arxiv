    "the present strong evidence for lepton flavor changing neutrino oscillations in neutrino data  @xcite implies the existence of non - zero masses for the light neutrinos , and provides the first experimental clue for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these oscillations also give an important information on the neutrino mixing angles of the maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix ( @xmath10 )  @xcite .",
    "the experimentally suggested smallness of the three neutrino masses can be explained in a very simple and elegant way by the seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is usually implemented by the introduction of three heavy right - handed ( rh ) majorana neutrinos whose masses , @xmath11 , can be much higher than the sm particle masses .",
    "the smallness of the light neutrino masses , @xmath12 , appears naturally due to the induced large suppression by the ratio of the two very distant mass scales that are involved in the @xmath13 seesaw mass matrices , the majorana matrix @xmath14 and the dirac matrix @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , in the one generation case , where the seesaw model predicts @xmath16 , light neutrino masses in the 0.1 - 1 ev range can be generated with @xmath15 being of the order of the electroweak scale , @xmath17 gev , and large @xmath14 of the order of @xmath18 gev .",
    "this huge separation between @xmath14 and the electroweak scale has , however , a serious drawback since it leads to the well known hierarchy problem of the sm , where a tree level higgs boson mass of the order of @xmath19 is driven by the radiative corrections involving the majorana neutrinos to very unnatural high values related to the new scale @xmath14 .",
    "the most elegant solution to this hierarchy problem is provided by the introduction of the symmetry relating fermions and bosons , called supersymmmetry ( susy ) .",
    "when the seesaw mechanism for the neutrino mass generation is implemented in a susy context , the susy scalar partners of the neutrinos , i.e. the sneutrinos , do also contribute to the radiative corrections of the higgs boson masses and cancel the dangerous contributions from the majorana neutrinos , solving in this way the hierarchy problem of the simplest non - susy version of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the best evidence of supersymmetry would be obviously the discovery of the susy particles in the present or next generation colliders . however , there are alternative ways to test supersymmetry which are indirect and complementary to the direct susy particle searches .",
    "these refer to the potential measurement of the susy particle contributions , via radiative corrections , to rare processes which are being explored at present and whose rates are predicted to be highly suppressed in the sm . among these processes ,",
    "the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays are probably the most interesting ones for various reasons . on one hand",
    ", they get vanishing rates in the sm with massless neutrinos and highly suppressed rates in the sm with massive netrinos .",
    "the smallness of these rates in the non - susy version of the seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation is due to their suppression by inverse powers of the heavy scale @xmath14 . on the other hand , although these decays have not been seen so far in the present experiments , there are very restrictive upper bounds on their possible rates which imply important restrictions on the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "these restrictions apply even more severely to the case of softly broken susy theories with massive neutrinos and the seesaw mechanism , since these give rise to higher rates  @xcite , being suppressed by inverse powers of the susy breaking scale , @xmath20 tev , instead of inverse powers of @xmath14 .    we will be devoted here in particular to the lfv @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays of type @xmath21 and @xmath22 where the present experimental upper bounds are the most restrictive ones  @xcite ,",
    "specifically , @xmath23 our aim in this paper is to analize the branching ratios that can be generated for all these processes in the context of the susy - seesaw scenario with the minimal susy content , i.e the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , enhanced by the addition of three rh neutrinos and their corresponding susy partners .",
    "these lfv processes are induced by loops of susy particles which transmit the lepton flavor mixing from the slepton mass matrices to the observable charged lepton sector .",
    "the intergenerational mixing in the slepton sector , @xmath24 , is induced in turn by the radiative corrections involving the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath25 or , simmilarly , by the running of the soft susy parameters in the slepton sector , via the renormalization group equations ( rges ) , from the high energy scale , @xmath26 , where the heavy majorana neutrinos are still active , down to the electroweak scale .",
    "we will assume here a minimal supergravity scenario ( msugra ) with universal soft parameters at @xmath27 and the breaking of the electroweak symmetry being generated radiatively .",
    "this scenario is also refered to in the literature as the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) .",
    "the above lfv processes have previously been studied in the susy - seesaw context by several authors  @xcite , under some specific assumptions for both seesaw parameters , @xmath15 ( or @xmath25 , since they are related by @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the ratio between the two mssm higgs vacuum spectation values ) and @xmath14 , and for the msugra parameters , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "our present study of these decay channels updates , completes and corrects the previous anlayses in several respects .",
    "first we include , by the first time to our knowledge , the full set of susy one - loop contributions to the @xmath8 decays , namely , the photon , the z boson , and the higgs bosons penguin diagrams , and the box diagrams . the most complete computation so far of these @xmath8 decays was done in  @xcite where the contributions from the photon and z boson penguin diagrams and from the box diagrams were included , but they focused on the particular choice of degenerate heavy majorana neutrinos and they presented numerical results just for @xmath35 decays .",
    "we extend this previous study by including in addition the higgs penguin diagrams mediated by the three neutral mssm bosons , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath32 , and correct their results for the z penguin contributions .",
    "we also extend their study in that we present results for the three decays , @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 and consider both possible scenarios , degenerate and hierarchical heavy neutrinos .",
    "the contributions from the higgs penguin diagrams , in the susy - seesaw model , were firstly analized in  @xcite .",
    "they worked in the large @xmath40 limit and used the mass insertion approximation to account for the induced effect from the intergenerational slepton mixing in the susy contributing loops .",
    "there it was concluded that these higgs - mediated contributions can be very relevant in the large @xmath34 region , because the radiatively induced lfv higgs-@xmath0-@xmath1 couplings grow as @xmath41 ( and , in consequence , the @xmath42 as @xmath43 , and also because the susy one - loop contributions do not decouple in these couplings .",
    "these large @xmath34 enhacement and susy non - decoupling behaviour were also found in the lfv higgs boson decays , @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "a more exhaustive study of the @xmath38 and other higgs - mediated lfv @xmath0 decays , including an estimate of the higgs contributions , were done in  @xcite .",
    "however , these previous numerical estimates of the higgs contributions to lfv @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays were done in the context of a generic mssm ( see also  @xcite ) , where the higgs boson mass , or equivalently @xmath45 , is an input parameter and can take small values of the order of 100 gev which produces larger rates . a more recent study on the lfv higgs decays has been done in  @xcite in the susy - gut @xmath46 context .",
    "we instead work here in the msugra context where all the mssm particle masses are quantities derived from the msugra parameters .",
    "we will see here that this and the requirement of compatibility with the present experimental lower bounds for all the susy particle masses  @xcite do indeed constraint the contribution from the higgs penguins .    in the present work",
    "we also include the predictions for the @xmath21 channels which , for the context we work with , are interestingly correlated with the @xmath47 rates .",
    "this correlation has been studied previously in the generic mssm context in  @xcite and in a similar msugra context in  @xcite , but in this later the dominant photon penguin approximation was used .",
    "we will update this comparative analysis of the @xmath21 and @xmath47 rates , in the msugra context , including the full contributions , and considering the very recent upper bounds for @xmath48  @xcite and @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also require the input seesaw parameters to be compatible with the present neutrino data . for this comparison with the neutrino data we use the parametrization first introduced in  @xcite for the study of the @xmath50 decay .",
    "our final goal will be to use the susy contributions to all the above lfv @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays as an efficient way to test the msugra and seesaw parameters .",
    "with this goal in mind we will analize here the size of the branching ratios in terms of the msugra and seesaw parameters and will explore in detail the restrictions imposed from the present experimental bounds .",
    "we will find that for some plausible choices of the seesaw parameters , being compatible with neutrino data , there are indeed large excluded regions in the msugra parameter space .",
    "the present work is organized as follows . in section  [ mssmnur ]",
    "we will review the basic aspects of the mssm extended with three rh neutrinos , their susy partners and the seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation .",
    "the lepton flavor mixing in the slepton sector and in the msugra context will be explained in section  [ lfv ] .",
    "there we also include the exact diagonalization of the sfermion mass matrices , both in the slepton and in the sneutrino sectors .",
    "the analytical results of the lfv @xmath8 decays will be presented in section  [ analytical ] .",
    "the numerical results for all the lfv @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays will be presented in section  [ numerical ] .",
    "finally , section  [ conclu ] will be devoted to the conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly review the additional basic ingredients that are needed to extend the mssm in order to include three right handed neutrinos , their corresponding susy partners , i.e. the sneutrinos , and the generation of neutrino masses by the seesaw mechanism .",
    "we follow closely the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite to describe the susy - seesaw scenario and the connection with neutrino data . for the other sectors of the mssm",
    "we assume here the standard conventions as defined , for instance , in  @xcite .",
    "we start with the yukawa - sector of the mssm - seesaw that contains the three left handed ( lh ) sm neutrinos @xmath51 and three extra right handed ( rh ) massive neutrinos @xmath52 , whose yukawa interactions provide , after spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , together with the right handed neutrino masses , the following mass lagrangian containing the dirac and majorana mass terms , @xmath53    where , @xmath54    here @xmath15 is the @xmath13 dirac mass matrix that is related to the @xmath55 yukawa coupling matrix @xmath25 and the mssm higgs vacum expectation value , @xmath56 with @xmath17 gev , by @xmath57 .",
    "the other mssm higgs doublet gives masses to the charged leptons by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are the yukawa couplings of the charged leptons and @xmath60 .",
    "the remaining @xmath55 mass matrix involved in the seesaw mechanism , @xmath14 , is real , non singular and symmetric , and provides the masses for the three rh neutrinos    the mass matrix @xmath61 is a @xmath62 complex symmetric matrix that can be diagonalized by a @xmath62 unitary matrix @xmath63 in the following way :    @xmath64    this gives 3 light majorana neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath65 , with masses @xmath12 ( i=1,2,3 ) , and three heavy ones @xmath66 , with masses @xmath67 ( i=1,2,3 ) , which are related to the weak eigenstates via ,    @xmath68    the seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation assumes a large separation between the two mass scales involved in @xmath15 and @xmath14 matrices .",
    "more specifically , we shall assume here that all matrix elements of @xmath15 are much smaller than those of @xmath14 , @xmath69 , and the predictions of the seesaw model are then given in power series of a matrix defined as , @xmath70 in particular , the previous diagonalization of the mass matrix @xmath61 can be solved in power series of @xmath71 . for simplicity , we choose to work here and in the rest of this paper , in a flavor basis where the rh majorana mass matrix , @xmath14 , and the charged lepton mass matrix , @xmath72 , are flavor diagonal .",
    "this means that all flavor mixing of the lh sector is included in the mixing matrix @xmath10 . by working to the lowest orders of these power series expansions one finds , in the flavor basis , the following neutrino @xmath13 matrices ,    @xmath73    here , @xmath74 is already diagonal , but @xmath75 is not yet diagonal .",
    "the rotation from this flavor basis to the mass eigenstate basis is finally given by the mns unitary matrix , @xmath10 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 and the diagonalization of @xmath61 in eqs .",
    "( [ mass6x6 ] ) and ( [ matrizu ] ) can be performed by the following unitary @xmath62 matrix :    @xmath77    as for the @xmath10 matrix , we use the standard parametrization given by ,    @xmath78    where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "regarding the sneutrino sector , and because of susy , the introduction of three rh neutrinos , @xmath81 , leads to the addition of the three corresponding susy partners , @xmath82 .",
    "thus , there are two complex scalar fields @xmath83 and @xmath84 per generation , as in the charged slepton case where there are @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the difference is that in the sneutrino sector , the seesaw matrix @xmath71 is involved , as in the neutrino sector , and gives rise to a natural suppression of the rh sneutrino components in the relevant mass eigenstates .",
    "this fact makes the diagonalization procedure simpler in the sneutrino sector than in the charged slepton one . in order to understand properly this feature of the mssm - seesaw model",
    ", we will illustrate in the following the simplest case of one generation , where this suppression already manifests .",
    "for this , we follow closely  @xcite .",
    "the generalization of this decoupling behaviour of the @xmath82 components to the three generations case is straightforward and we omit to show it here , for brevity .",
    "one starts by adding the new terms in the mssm lagrangian that involve the @xmath81 and/or @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , the usual mssm soft susy breaking potential must be modified to include new mass and coupling terms for the right handed sneutrinos , which for the one generation case are the following , @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the new soft breaking parameters .",
    "these are in addition to the usual soft parameters of the slepton sector , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the sneutrino mass terms of the mssm - seesaw model can then be written in the one generation case as , @xmath94 with , @xmath95 notice that , in the sneutrino sector , there are several mass scales involved , the soft susy - breaking parameters , @xmath91 , @xmath88 , @xmath90 and @xmath89 , the dirac mass @xmath15 , the @xmath1-mass parameter , the z boson mass @xmath96 and the majorana neutrino mass @xmath14 .",
    "our basic assumption in all this work is that @xmath14 is much heavier than the other mass scales involved ( except @xmath27 ) , @xmath97 .",
    "the size of @xmath90 has been discussed in the literature  @xcite and seems more controversial . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume here that this is also smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "in this large @xmath14 limit , the diagonalization of the previous sneutrino squared mass matrix is simpler and leads to four mass eigenstates , two of which are light , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and two heavy , @xmath100 , @xmath101 . in the leading orders of the series expansion in powers of @xmath71",
    "the mass eigenstates and their corresponding mass eigenvalues are given by ( we correct in the definitions of @xmath102 and @xmath99 some typos with wrong signs of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath103 here",
    "we can see that the heavy states @xmath104 will couple very weakly to the rest of particles of the mssm via their @xmath105 component , which is highly suppresed by the small factor @xmath71 and , therefore , it is a good approximation to ignore them and keep just the light states @xmath106 , which are made mainly of @xmath105 and its complex conjugate @xmath107 .",
    "one says then that the heavy sneutrinos decouple from the low energy physics .",
    "the generalization of the previous argument to the three generations case leads to the conclusion that , in the seesaw limit , @xmath108 , the physical sneutrino eigenstates , @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) are made mainly of the @xmath111 states with @xmath112 respectively , and their corresponding complex conjugates .",
    "the process from the weak eigenstates to the mass eigenstates is simplified to the diagonalization of a @xmath13 sneutrino mass matrix .",
    "this is to be compared with the more complex case of charged sleptons where the corresponding process requires the diagonalization of a @xmath62 slepton mass matrix .",
    "this will be presented in the next section , where the most general case with lepton flavor mixing is considered .",
    "to end this section , we shortly comment on the parameterization that we use to make contact with the neutrino data .",
    "it was first introduced in  @xcite to study the @xmath113 decay and used later by many other authors .",
    "the advantage of this parameterization is that instead of using as input parameters the seesaw mass matrices @xmath15 and @xmath14 it uses the three physical light neutrino masses , @xmath12 , the three physical heavy neutrino masses , @xmath67 , the @xmath10 matrix , and a general complex @xmath13 orthogonal matrix @xmath114 . with our signs and matrix conventions , the relation between the seesaw mass matrices and these other more physical quantities is given by , @xmath115 where @xmath116 and , as we have said , @xmath117 .",
    "thus , instead of proposing directly possible textures for @xmath15 , or @xmath25 , one proposes possible values for @xmath118 and @xmath114 , and sets @xmath119 and @xmath10 to their suggested values from the experimental data .",
    "notice that any hypothesis for @xmath114 different from the unit matrix will lead to an additional lepton flavor mixing , besides the one introduced by the @xmath10 .",
    "notice also that the previous relation holds at the energy scale @xmath14 , and to use it properly one must apply the renormalization group equations to run the input experimental data @xmath120 and @xmath10 from the low energies @xmath121 up to @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we will also include these running effects in the numerical results for all the branching ratios presented in this work .    regarding the matrix @xmath114",
    ", we will consider the following parameterization : @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 are arbitrary complex angles .",
    "this parameterization was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the study of @xmath128 decays .",
    "it has also been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite with specific values for the @xmath129 angles to study the implications for baryogenesis in the case of hierarchical neutrinos . and",
    "it has also been considered by  @xcite to study the lfv higgs boson decays into @xmath130 .",
    "finally , for the numerical estimates in this work , we will consider the following two plausible scenarios , at the low energies , being compatible with data :    * scenario a : with quasi - degenerate light and degenerate heavy neutrinos , @xmath131 * scenario b : with hierarchical light and hierarchical heavy neutrinos , @xmath132    in the two above scenarios , we will fix the input low energy data to the following values , @xmath133 ev , @xmath134 ev , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( see for instance , ref .",
    "some results will also be presented for the alternative choice of small but non - vanishing @xmath139 .",
    "once the three @xmath81 and the three @xmath140 are added to the mssm particle content , lepton flavor mixing is generated in the slepton sector .",
    "this can be seen as the result of a misalignment between the rotations leading to the mass eigenstate basis of sleptons with respect to the one of leptons , which is generically present in the susy - seesaw models .",
    "this misalignment is radiatively generated from the yukawa couplings of the majorana neutrinos and can be sizable , in both , the charged slepton and sneutrino sectors .",
    "usually , it is implemented via the renormalization group equations ( rges ) , which we take within the context of msugra extended with three right - handed neutrinos and their susy partners . in consequence , we assume here universal soft - susy - breaking parameters at the large energies @xmath141 , which must now include the corresponding parameters of the neutrino and sneutrino sectors , namely , @xmath142 here , @xmath30 and @xmath32 are the usual universal soft susy breaking parameters in msugra , @xmath143 with @xmath144 , and @xmath145 .",
    "notice that we have used the @xmath13 matrix form with @xmath146 or equivalently @xmath147 .",
    "the effects of the running from @xmath27 down to @xmath14 on the soft mass matrices of the slepton sector are found then by solving the rges which now include the corresponding terms and equations for the yukawas of the neutrinos and soft breaking parameters of the sneutrino sector , as they are active particles in this energy range . below the energy",
    "scales @xmath14 , the right handed neutrinos decouple and the effects of running from @xmath14 down to the electroweak scale on the various parameters are obtained by solving the rges but now without the terms and equations containing the yukawas and soft breaking neutrino parameters .",
    "the obtained values at the electroweak scale of the various susy parameters are the relevant ones in order to build the slepton and sneutrino mass matrices that will be presented below .    to solve numerically the rges we use the fortran code spheno  @xcite that we have adapted to include the full flavor structure of the @xmath13 soft susy breaking mass and trilinear coupling matrices and of the yukawa coupling matrices .",
    "this program solves the full rges ( i.e. including the commented extra equations and neutrino terms ) in the two loops approximation , computes the mssm spectra at low energies , and uses as inputs the universal msugra parameters , @xmath30 , @xmath32 , @xmath31 ; the value of @xmath34 at the electroweak scale , and the sign of the @xmath1 mass parameter .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is derived from the unification condition for the @xmath148 and @xmath149 couplings , @xmath150 .",
    "for all the numerical analysis performed in this work , we have got very close values to @xmath151 gev .",
    "the value of @xmath152 is derived from the requirement of the proper radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",

    "it is a quite stricking result .    in summary",
    ", we obtain in the hierachical case much larger rates than in the degenerate one , and one must pay attention to these values , because the rates in several channels do get in conflict with the experimental bounds . more specifically , the choice of a complex @xmath114 matrix with large modules and/or large arguments of @xmath125 and/or @xmath126 and a light susy spectrum is very constrained by data .",

    "we have shown in this paper that the lfv @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays do provide a very efficient tool to look for indirect susy signals . whereas the predicted rates for these processes are negligible within the sm , the susy scenario considered here provides in contrast significant rates which are at the present experimental reach for some of the studied channels .",

    "the reason for these significant rates is because of the important lepton flavor mixing that is generated in the slepton sector due to large yukawa neutrino couplings , which is transmited via the rge running from the large energies down the electroweak scale .    with the motivation in mind of testing susy",
    "we have studied exhaustively in this work the particular decays @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath35 , and the correlated radiative decays @xmath288 , @xmath289 and @xmath113 .",
    "all of these channels have quite challenging experimental bounds and they are expected to improve in the future .",
    "we have explored the dependence of the branching ratios for these lfv processes with the various parameters involved , namely , the msugra and seesaw parameters . we have computed and analyzed in full detail all the contributions from the susy loops to",
    "the @xmath185 decays . our analytical results for these decays correct and complete previous results in the literature .",
    "in particular we have presented the results for the separate contributions from the @xmath188-penguin , the @xmath189-penguin , the higgs - penguin and the box diagrams and shown explicitely the @xmath188-penguin dominance . in the numerical estimates",
    "we have presented results for both the @xmath185 and the correlated radiative decays @xmath9 .    for the degenerate heavy neutrinos case , we have got rates for all the studied lfv @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays that are below the present experimental upper bounds .",
    "the largest rates we get , within the explored range of the seesaw and msugra parameter space , are for the @xmath0 decays .",
    "specifically , @xmath290 and @xmath291 , corresponding to the extreme values of @xmath292 and @xmath252 gev and for the lowest values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 explored .",
    "the case of hierarchical heavy neutrinos turns out to be much more interesting .",
    "first of all , we get much larger branching ratios than in the previous case and secondly they are in many cases above the present experimental bounds .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the behaviour of the branching ratios with the msugra and seesaw parameters also in the hierarchical case .",
    "the largest ratios found are again for @xmath288 and @xmath2 decays .",
    "all the lfv @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay rates are mainly sensitive to @xmath178 , the heaviest neutrino mass @xmath181 , which we have set to @xmath293 gev , and the complex angles in the @xmath114 matrix @xmath125 and @xmath126 , which have been taken in the range @xmath294 , @xmath295 and @xmath296 . for the values of these parameters at the upper limit of this",
    "studied interval we have found that some of the predicted branching ratios are clearly above the corresponding experimental upper bounds .",
    "the most restrictive channels being @xmath113 , @xmath35 and @xmath288 . therefore , we get in this region important restrictions on the posible values of the msugra and seesaw parameters . in particular , for @xmath297 , we get that the whole studied range of @xmath298 with @xmath292 is totally excluded by @xmath288",
    ". values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the low region below @xmath299 gev are also excluded by @xmath2 data .",
    "the case of @xmath125 is even more restrictive , because the predictions for @xmath113 , @xmath35 and @xmath288 totally exclude a light susy scenario , for practicaly all @xmath125 values .    perhaps , the most striking result is that even for the most conservative choice of @xmath285 , that is @xmath300 , there are also important restrictions at low @xmath30 , @xmath31 and large @xmath178 values . in particular , for @xmath292 , values lower or equal than @xmath301 gev and @xmath302 gev are totally excluded by @xmath288 , @xmath113 and @xmath4 data .    for this conservative choice of @xmath303",
    "we have also found the surprising result that both @xmath113 and @xmath4 place important restrictions on the allowed values for the @xmath10 angle @xmath139 . for values lower or equal than @xmath301 gev and @xmath302 gev and for @xmath304 and @xmath305 gev",
    ", we get that values of @xmath139 larger than 1 degree are not allowed by these lfv data .    in conclusion",
    ", it is clear from these results that the lfv @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays studied here do restrict significantly the msugra and seesaw parameter space . a more refined analysis of the restrictions on this multidimensional parameter space , deserves a further study .",
