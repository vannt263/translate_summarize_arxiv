    "the idea that einstein s tensor gravitational field might be accompanied by a massless scalar partner was first suggested in the twenties by kaluza @xcite . since then , such tensor - scalar gravity theories have been studied in detail by many authors @xcite .",
    "string theory has recently revived the motivation for considering gravitational - strength scalar fields , such as the ( model - independent ) dilaton or the ( kaluza - klein - type ) moduli ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the simplest versions of tensor - scalar theories of gravity ( those respecting the equivalence principle ) the coupling between matter and the scalar field @xmath3",
    "is described by a single `` coupling function '' @xmath1 , such that all physical mass scales get multiplied by a factor @xmath6 $ ] when measured in `` einstein units '' ( see below for the definition of the einstein conformal frame ) .",
    "for instance , the jordan - fierz - brans - dicke ( jfbd ) theory is the one - parameter theory defined by a linear coupling function , @xmath7 .",
    "the jfbd theory is not an appealing alternative to general relativity because its only ( dimensionless ) parameter @xmath8 needs to be fine - tuned to a small value , @xmath9 , to be consistent with existing experimental data .",
    "[ see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion of the constraints on tensor - scalar gravity brought by solar - system , and binary pulsar , data .",
    "] by contrast , it has been shown that more general theories with nonlinear coupling functions , containing no small parameters , can be naturally compatible with experimental data because the cosmological evolution drives the background value of @xmath3 toward a value that minimizes the coupling function @xmath1 , thereby reducing by a large factor all the present observable effects of @xmath3 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "within such cosmological - attractor models , the only regime in which the scalar field can play a quantitatively important role is early cosmology .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is the earliest cosmological process that is physically well established and about which one has reasonably accurate observational data .",
    "its importance for constraining many physical or astrophysical scenarios was first pointed out by shvartsman @xcite . for recent treatments",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in particular , bbn is crucially used for deriving an upper bound on the cosmological baryon density @xmath10 which , even for extreme parameters , is claimed to be @xmath11 @xcite ( here , @xmath12 ) .",
    "one of the main motivations of the present paper is to examine whether the presence of a gravitational - strength scalar field @xmath3 , having a generic non - jfbd , i.e. , nonlinear , coupling function @xmath1 , can significantly modify the standard limit on @xmath13 , while being still compatible with present gravitational experiments .",
    "a secondary motivation is to study the level of present scalar admixture to einstein s gravity ( observable , in principle , in precision tests of relativistic gravity ) which is naturally compatible with bbn data , i.e. with observed light element abundances .",
    "our analysis is more general and/or more exact than previous attacks on this problem .",
    "indeed , we consider the case of a nonlinear coupling function @xmath1 admitting a local minimum , while most previous studies restricted themselves to jfbd - type theories @xcite ( see also the related studies of bbn limits on the variability of the gravitational constant @xmath14 @xcite , @xcite ) . a recent work by santiago et al .",

    "this paradoxical result raises two questions : ( i ) how can an abnormally large expansion rate , around the ( nominal ) time of freeze - out of the neutron to proton ratio , lead to quasi - normal light element abundances ? ; and , ( ii ) does this imply that , when @xmath308 , the present value of @xmath23 ( which measures the deviation between general relativity and tensor - scalar gravity ) can be large ?    to answer the first question , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fignew ] the coupling function @xmath1 , which is essentially the logarithm of the speed - up factor , as a function of the inverse ( physical ) temperature @xmath309 ( we use as input values @xmath303 , and @xmath310 ) .",

    "if we define ( as is often done ) a nominal freeze - out temperature as the temperature @xmath313 where the actual @xmath117 ratio starts to deviate significantly from @xmath314 ( a sign that weak interactions become slow compared to the expansion rate ) , we see that the value of @xmath313 in tensor - scalar gravity is larger than in general relativity , as expected from the fact that the expansion rate is much larger ( @xmath1 being initially frozen at @xmath315 ) .",
    "if that were all , this would lead to a significantly larger value for the @xmath117 ratio .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fignew ] illustrates two physical phenomena that modify this naive conclusion .",
    "first , around @xmath316 mev , the source term @xmath317 starts to have a strong effect on @xmath1 : it makes @xmath1 drop precipitously toward zero , where it bounces twice to end up being frozen ( when @xmath318 mev ) at a very small limiting value @xmath319 . the second important phenomenon illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fignew ] is the fact that the freeze - out phenomenon is not something which takes place at a precise moment in time , but is an integrated phenomenon .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the approximate plateau reached by @xmath117 ( before it drops around @xmath320 mev when nuclear reactions start ) is due to the integrated effect of an evolution which takes place before , during and after the precipitous fall of @xmath1 toward small values .",
    "it is therefore impossible to estimate analytically the final `` plateau '' value of @xmath117 from the sole knowledge of the nominal freeze - out temperature .",
    "in particular , we see that @xmath117 is initially larger than the standard gr value , but ends up , in this example , being somewhat smaller .",
    "this figure illustrates the necessity of resorting to a full numerical bbn code .",
    "let us now address the second question : what does an initially large value of @xmath321 imply for the present value of @xmath23",
    "? can @xmath23 be large ?",
    "the answer is no , for the following reason : when @xmath19 is large , the source @xmath118 , active around @xmath322 , is very efficient in attracting @xmath3 toward zero ( through a damped - oscillatory evolution ) .",
    "moreover this attraction effect is amplified by nonlinearities so that , for a fixed @xmath19 , the post - bbn value @xmath278 does not increase monotonically with @xmath323 , but rather decreases for large @xmath294 values after having reached a maximum when @xmath324 .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] , @xmath325 ( considered as a function of @xmath326 ) reaches the maximum value @xmath327 when @xmath328 .    for some particular values of @xmath19 (",

    "<S> big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is studied within the framework of a two - parameter family of tensor - scalar theories of gravitation , with nonlinear scalar - matter coupling function @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we run a bbn code modified by tensor - scalar gravity , and impose that the theoretically predicted bbn yields of deuterium , helium and lithium lie within some conservative observational ranges . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that large initial values of @xmath1 ( corresponding to cosmological expansion rates , for temperatures higher than 1 mev , much larger than standard ) are compatible with observed bbn yields . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bbn - inferred upper bound on the cosmological baryon density is insignificantly modified by considering tensor - scalar gravity . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the effect of @xmath2 annihilation together with the subsequent effect of the matter - dominated era ( which both tend to decouple @xmath3 from matter ) , we find that the present value of the scalar coupling , i.e. the present level of deviation from einstein s theory , must be , for compatibility with bbn , smaller than @xmath4 when @xmath5  . </S>"
