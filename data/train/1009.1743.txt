    "the fermi surface is a property of the single - electron excitation spectrum . in any fermi liquid",
    ", it spans the momenta , @xmath50 , at which the energy dependence of the single - electron green s function develops a pole at the fermi energy .",
    "hence , a reconstruction of the fermi surface across the qcp implies that the single - electron green s function contains a singularity at the qcp .",
    "indeed , the conduction - electron green s function of a kondo lattice system can very generally be written as @xmath51 in the absence of static kondo screening , the self - energy @xmath52 is non - singular .",
    "correspondingly , the fermi surface is smoothly connected to that of the conduction electrons alone ; it is small  @xcite . in the presence of static kondo screening , @xmath53 develops a pole ; for @xmath54 and @xmath20 small compared to the coherent kondo scale , it takes the form @xmath55 here @xmath56 and @xmath57 specify the strength and energy of the kondo resonance @xcite , and @xmath58 is the non - singular term of the self - energy .",
    "the existence of this pole in @xmath59 shifts the fermi momenta from their positions on the small fermi surface , @xmath50 , to those on a large fermi surface , @xmath60 .",
    "approaching the point of critically - destroyed kondo effect , the quasiparticle weight vanishes @xcite in accordance with the divergence of the quasiparticle mass seen in specific heat and resistivity @xcite .",
    "in particular , at the qcp , both the strength , @xmath56 , and the energy , @xmath57 , of the kondo resonance ( see eq .  [ sigma - kondo ] ) go to zero in the @xmath61 and @xmath62 limit .",
    "moreover , the interacting nature of the fixed point implies an @xmath4-scaling of the single - electron green s function : the reasoning is analogous to that for the dynamical spin susceptibility @xcite , and the property can be illustrated by explicit calculations in simplified model settings for critical kondo destruction @xcite .",
    "similar forms of dynamical scaling of the single - electron spectra are likely a generic feature of other types of kondo - destroying qcps @xcite ; they appear in related contexts as well @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the linear - in - temperature electrical resistivity can not be used as evidence for @xmath63-scaling of the single - electron excitations .",
    "indeed , the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity does not in general measure the temperature dependence of the single - electron relaxation rate and this is so even for spin - density - wave qcps @xcite .",
    "the scaling form for the single - electron green s function in the quantum - critical regime can be expressed as follows : @xmath64 the associated relaxation rate , defined in the quantum relaxational regime ( @xmath65 ) according to @xmath66_{{e}=0}^{-1 } , \\label{gamma - def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is linear in temperature : @xmath67 , where @xmath9 is a universal constant .",
    "we can use these properties of the single - electron green s function    to understand the crossover of the hall coefficient . in the fermi - liquid regimes on either side of the qcp , the hall coefficient reflects the respective fermi surface ; it is in particular independent of the quasiparticle residue @xcite ( see supplementary information vi ) .",
    "the distinct ( large and small ) fermi surfaces in the two fermi - liquid regimes yield different end values of the hall coefficient .",
    "the central question is how the two fermi surfaces are connected across the qcp . because the single - electron green s function characterizes each of the two fermi liquids , this is related to the critical relaxation rate , @xmath68 , of the single - electron states . at zero temperature",
    ", @xmath69 vanishes ; the change from one fermi surface to the other is sharp , occurring precisely at the qcp .",
    "the hall coefficient must undergo a sharp jump in accordance with the experimental findings . at any non - zero temperature , a continuous crossover from one fermi surface to the other",
    "is controlled by the single - electron relaxation rate @xmath68 . given the above described behavior of the hall coefficient in the adjacent fermi - liquid regimes with well defined but different fermi surfaces , its crossover has to be related to the finite - temperature broadening of the critical single - electron states on the fermi surface .",
    "our observation of a linear - in - temperature width of the critical hall crossover is therefore consistent with a linear - in - temperature relaxation rate .",
    "by contrast , our experimental finding is incompatible with the spin - density - wave picture of order parameter fluctuations and the concomitant gaussian fixed point , which would be accompanied by a superlinear temperature dependence of the hall crossover width ( see section vi of the supplementary information ) .",
    "the single - electron green s function serves as the proper means to specify whether a metal obeys the standard theory of solids - landau s fermi - liquid theory . the fact that eq .",
    "( [ g - scaling ] ) , with a non - zero @xmath56 , _ i.e. _ , a large fermi surface across the qcp , fails to describe our data is consistent with a breakdown of the heavy - fermi - liquid quasiparticles at the qcp .",
    "more generally eq .",
    "( [ g - scaling ] ) , reminiscent of the green s function of gapless interacting electrons in one dimension @xcite , invalidates any fermi - liquid description . by using a single set of measurements on the same compound to probe both the collective fluctuations of the qcp and a critical destruction of the single - electron excitations ,",
    "our work provides the most direct association between quantum criticality and non - fermi - liquid behavior .    in summary ,",
    "we have carried out in - depth magnetotransport measurements in a prototypical quantum critical heavy - fermion metal , and we are able to distinguish a robust critical crossover from a sample - dependent background feature . by zooming into the vicinity of the qcp , we have shown that the width of the critical crossover is not only independent of sample quality but also proportional to temperature .",
    "this proportionality is consistent with the @xmath4 form in the dynamical critical scaling .",
    "coupled with the fact that the vanishing width in the zero - temperature limit implies a jump in the fermi surface , our findings point to the microscopic many - body excitations of a collapsing fermi surface as underlying the dynamical @xmath70-scaling of the macroscopic critical fluctuations .",
    "our results further establish the @xmath71-line as a means to probe the kondo breakdown .",
    "this should hold even when the kondo breakdown is separated from the paramagnetic - to - antiferromagnetic qcp @xcite .",
    "in addition , they might help to understand why the two coincide in stoichiometric ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0  and its close vicinity .",
    "more generally , the linkage between microscopics and macroscopics    is expected to be broadly relevant to the physics of strong correlations , considering that the finite - temperature properties are invariably abnormal in a wide array of quantum materials , and given that the fermi surface and its evolution as a function of control parameters  _ e.g. _ from the underdoped high - temperature cuprate superconductors to the overdoped ones @xcite  are playing an increasingly central role in understanding these systems .",
    "the hall crossovers in both the crossed - field ( @xmath14 ) and single - field ( @xmath47 ) experiments ( see supplementary information i ) were fitted with the empirical crossover function @xmath72 that contains not only a critical component @xcite but also a linear term @xmath73 to account for the background behavior . @xmath18 and @xmath74 are the zero - field and infinite - field values , respectively .",

    "the coherent part of @xmath136 is therefore the diagnostic feature on either side of the transition , and it jumps at the qcp in accord with the sudden fermi surface change .    this jump is manifested in the hall measurement , because the hall coefficient is independent of the quasiparticle residue .",

    "the fact that the quasiparticle residue does not appear in the hall coefficient of a fermi liquid can be seen in a number of related ways .",

    "finally , for a spherically symmetric but otherwise arbitrary dispersion it has been shown explicitly by diagrammatic calculations that the hall coefficient is not renormalized by the electron - electron interactions @xcite .    at non - zero temperatures , the quasiparticle relaxation rate at either @xmath144 for @xmath145 , or @xmath146 for @xmath147 , no longer vanishes .",
    "in fact , inside the fermi - liquid phase ( with either large or small fermi surface ) , the temperature dependence of @xmath148 has to be quadratic in @xmath20 .",
    "however , the fermi surface remains well defined in these regimes . at finite temperatures , the change from one fermi surface to the other",

    "because of the absence of a phase transition at any non - zero temperature , the sharp reconstruction of the fermi surface at @xmath2 is turned into a fermi - surface crossover across the @xmath149 line . the restriction to the quantum critical regime",
    "implicates that the linear in temperature relaxation rate present in this regime determines the broadening of the fermi surface change . from the relation of the hall coefficient to the fermi surface ( described above ) we associate the width of the hall crossover with this broadening and consequently with the relaxation rate @xmath150 of the single - electron green s function .    to be more specific ,",
    "consider a general scaling form for the single - electron green s function at the fermi momentum in the quantum critical region : @xmath151 for a gaussian fixed point , a dangerously irrelevant variable will invalidate @xmath63-scaling and make @xmath152 .",
    "correspondingly , the single - particle relaxation rate @xmath150 ( defined in eq .  4 of the main text ) will be superlinear in temperature and the hall crossover width as a function of the magnetic field will in general not be linear in temperature .",
    "an interacting fixed point , on the other hand , can generate @xmath153 with a relaxation rate that is linear in temperature and be compatible with the linear - in-@xmath20 hall - crossover width observed .    an important question concerns the critical exponent @xmath154 as defined by the @xmath149 line , @xmath155 .",
