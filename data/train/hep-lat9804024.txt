    "in order to study @xmath1 non - perturbatively , lattice gauge theory has been most successful . however , there are some observables , where computational progress in lattice gauge theory has been slow .",
    "examples are : higher excited states of hadrons and mesons , finite density thermodynamics ( quark - gloun plasma ) , dynamical scattering calculations of cross sections or phase - shifts and hadron structure functions , in particular in the region of small @xmath2 and small @xmath3 ( @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) . in our opinion",
    "a non - perturbative hamiltonian approach may be a viable alternative . in deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering ,",
    "the success of the parton model suggests the physical idea to use a fast moving frame also for a computational study of those processes .",
    "the parton model can be justified using the operator product expansion . in equal - time quantization ,",
    "the breit - frame is the most convenient choice of frame in order to interpret structure functions . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors have proposed such a scheme based on equal - time quantization , using a lattice hamiltonian on a momentum lattice corresponding to a fast moving frame ( breit - frame ) .",
    "it has been applied to the scalar @xmath6 theory in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "distribution functions and the mass spectrum in the close neighbourhood of the critical line of the second order phase transition have been computed .    here",
    "we study @xmath8 , the so - called massive schwinger model , in this framework .",
    "this model is physically interesting due to the following properties : ( i ) it is super - renormalizable .",
    "( ii ) it has a limit where the model is analytically soluble : the massless limit  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) it has an ( axial ) anomaly .",
    "( iv ) one can study the topological properties associated with @xmath0-actions and @xmath0-vacua .",
    "most of the analytic work on this model has been presented in refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this model is a widely studied benchmark problem for new methods .",
    "it has been studied by a variational method in the infinite - momentum frame @xcite , in discretized light - cone quantization @xcite , on the light - cone using orthogonal functions @xcite , on a finite lattice in equal time quantization @xcite and by strong coupling series expansion @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show : ( a ) the use of a fast moving frame , such that @xmath9 , in conjunction with _ equal - time _",
    "quantization works well also in @xmath8 .",
    "it is not necessary to go to the infinite momentum frame or to quantize on the light - cone .",
    "we obtain quite precise results in the ultra - relativistic region @xmath10 .",
    "it has been claimed that low energy states of the massive schwinger model are not well aproximated in equal - time field theory .",
    "we show here that the problem is not equal - time quantization , but the use of the rest - frame , which we avoid to do here .",
    "( b ) we consider as most important new results of this work the non - perturbative results of the dependence of the vector and scalar mass on the @xmath0-angle .",

    "one introduces a space - time lattice given by spacing @xmath12 with @xmath13 lattice nodes . via discrete fourier transformation",
    "one goes over to a momentum lattice , with cut - off @xmath14 and resolution @xmath15 .",
    "motivated by the parton picture we make the assumption that left - moving particles are not dynamically important , if physical particles are considered from a reference frame characterized by a velocity @xmath16 which is close to the velocity of light .",
    "we thus consider a momentum lattice where @xmath17 . in order to minimize the number of virtual particle pairs created from the vacuum , we choose a small lattice size .",
    "the reason for this is that the number of vacuum pairs is roughly proportional to a vacuum density times the lattice size . on the other hand , a fast - moving physical particle is lorentz contracted ; thus it fits in a small lattice volume ( when compared to the rest - frame ) .    for the purpose of computing the mass spectrum ,",
    "we need to determine the vacuum energy . because the vacuum has the quantum number @xmath18 , the vacuum energy ( and only this ) is computed in the rest frame . because the model is super - renormalizable",
    ", one can perform the continuum limit @xmath19 .",
    "the only renormalization necessary is the subtraction of the vacuum energy . on a space - time lattice ,",
    "one has to satisfy a physical condition ( scaling window ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the correlation length in dimensionless units , related to the physical mass of the ground state by @xmath22 . in a strongly relativistic system ,",
    "@xmath23 , thus when @xmath19 the scaling window is replaced by @xmath24 . for more details",
    "compare with ref.@xcite .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian in a sector with momentum @xmath25 to obtain the vacuum energy @xmath26 .",
    "then we diagonalize the hamiltonian in a sector @xmath27 corresponding to a relativistic velocity .",

    "one observes a cusp in the curves , becoming more pronounced when @xmath52 increases .",
    "this behavior is due to level crossings with higher lying states ( not shown in the fig . ) .",
