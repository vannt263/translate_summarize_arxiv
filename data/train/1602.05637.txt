    "in this paper , we construct quasimorphisms on groups that admit actions on cat(0 ) cube complexes .",
    "our emphasis is on finding quasimorphisms that are both _ efficient _ and _ effective_. by `` efficient '' we mean that the quasimorphisms have low defect . by `` effective ''",
    "we mean that the quasimorphisms take non - zero values on specified elements of the group .",
    "these two qualities , taken together , allow one to establish lower bounds for stable commutator length ( @xmath1 ) in the group .    according to bavard duality",
    "@xcite , if @xmath2 is a homogeneous quasimorphism of defect at most @xmath3 and @xmath4 , then @xmath5 .",
    "thus , for the strongest bound on @xmath1 , one needs to find effective quasimorphisms with the smallest possible defect .",
    "the quasimorphisms we define have similarities with the `` non - overlapping '' counting quasimorphisms of epstein and fujiwara @xcite , which in turn are a variation of the brooks counting quasimorphisms on free groups @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 is a cat(0 ) cube complex , there is a notion of a _",
    "tightly nested segment _ of half - spaces in @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath7 acts on @xmath6 _ non - transversely _ ( see definition  [ def : nontransverse2 ] ) , then for each tightly nested segment @xmath8 there is an associated counting quasimorphism @xmath9",
    ". this function counts non - overlapping copies ( or @xmath7translates ) of @xmath8 and @xmath10 inside characteristic subcomplexes of elements of @xmath7 . using the _",
    "median property _ of cat(0 ) cube complexes , we show that @xmath9 has defect at most @xmath11 , and therefore its homogenization @xmath12 has defect at most @xmath0 .",
    "( note that this bound is independent of both the length of @xmath8 and the dimension of @xmath6 . )",
    "we now have a large supply of efficient quasimorphisms , but it is by no means clear that any of them are non - trivial . our main task , given an element @xmath13 , is to find a tightly nested segment @xmath8 such that @xmath14 .",
    "this will only be possible for suitable elements @xmath15 ; for instance , if @xmath15 is conjugate to @xmath16 , then @xmath17 and every homogeneous quasimorphism vanishes on @xmath15 .",
    "for our main result we consider cube complexes with group actions that have properties in common with the standard actions of right angled artin groups on their associated cat(0 ) cube complexes .",
    "these are called _ raag - like _ actions ; see section  [ sec : raag - like ] and definition  [ def : raaglike ] .",
    "our main theorem is that for such actions , the desired segments @xmath8 can be found for _ every _ hyperbolic element @xmath15 .",
    "using bavard duality , we obtain :    [ thm : main ]    let @xmath6 be a cat(0 ) cube complex with a raag - like action by @xmath7 .",
    "then @xmath18 for every hyperbolic element @xmath19 .",
    "since the standard action of a right - angled artin group on its associated cat(0 ) cube complex is raag - like , with all non - trivial elements acting hyperbolically , the following corollary is immediate .",
    "[ cor : main ]    let @xmath7 be a right - angled artin group .",
    "then @xmath18 for every nontrivial @xmath13 .",
    "what is perhaps surprising about this result is that there is a _ uniform _",
    "gap for scl , independent of the dimension of @xmath6 .",
    "note that in theorem  [ thm : main ] we do not assume that @xmath6 is either finite - dimensional or locally finite ; thus corollary  [ cor : main ] applies to right - angled artin groups defined over arbitrary simplicial graphs .",
    "the defining properties of raag - like actions arose naturally while working out the arguments in this paper .",
    "it turns out , however , that raag - like actions are closely related to the _ special cube complexes _ of haglund and wise @xcite .",
    "that is , if @xmath7 acts freely on @xmath6 , then the action is raag - like if and only if the quotient complex @xmath20 is special .",
    "see section  [ sec : raag - like ] and remark  [ rem : special ] for the precise correspondence between these notions .",
    "there are other gap theorems for stable commutator length in the literature , though in some cases the emphasis is on the existence of a gap , rather than its size .",
    "the first such result was duncan and howie s theorem @xcite that every non - trivial element of a free group has stable commutator length at least @xmath21 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that in baumslag ",
    "solitar groups , stable commutator length is either zero or at least @xmath22 . a different result in @xcite states that if @xmath7 acts on a tree , then @xmath23 for every `` well - aligned '' element @xmath19 .",
    "there are also gap theorems for stable commutator length in hyperbolic groups @xcite and in mapping class groups ( and their finite - index subgroups ) @xcite , where existence of a gap is established . in these cases",
    "it is also determined which elements of the group have positive @xmath1 . in @xcite , the size of the gap in the case of a hyperbolic group",
    "is estimated , in terms of the number of generators and the hyperbolicity constant .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6.13 ) , it was shown that every finitely generated right - angled artin group @xmath7 embeds into the torelli subgroup of the mapping class group of a surface . since scl is positive on the torelli group @xcite , monotonicity implies that every non - trivial element of @xmath7 has positive scl .",
    "however , the lower bounds obtained in this way are neither explicit nor uniform .",
    "for instance , the genus of the surface needed in @xcite grows with the number of generators of @xmath7 , and this affects the bounds arising in @xcite ( which go to zero as the genus grows ) .",
    "there are numerous results on the existence of homogeneous quasimorphisms on groups , where the purpose is to show that the group has non - zero second bounded cohomology .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the space of homogeneous quasimorphisms on @xmath7 , modulo homomorphisms .",
    "then @xmath24 is a subspace of @xmath25 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that @xmath24 is infinite - dimensional for any hyperbolic group @xmath7 .",
    "recent results in this direction , involving both wider classes of groups and more general coefficient modules , include @xcite and @xcite . in the case of a finitely",
    "generated right - angled artin group @xmath7 , the space @xmath24 is known to be infinite - dimensional by @xcite and @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "we have mentioned that the _",
    "median property _ of cat(0 ) cube complexes is used to control the defect of our quasimorphisms .",
    "the use of medians in this context originated in @xcite , where they are used to define a bounded cohomology class ( the _ median class _ ) which has good functorial properties .",
    "this class is defined , and is _ non - trivial _",
    ", whenever one has a non - elementary group action on a finite - dimensional cat(0 ) cube complex .",
    "one consequence , among many others , is that @xmath26 is non - trivial for any such group , for a suitably defined coefficient module @xmath27 .",
    "our upper bound of @xmath0 for the defect of the quasimorphisms @xmath28 can actually be lowered to @xmath11 in the special case when the cat(0 ) cube complex is @xmath29dimensional ; see remark  [ rem : cfl6.6 ] .",
    "this statement then coincides with theorem 6.6 of @xcite , and thus we obtain a new proof of the latter result .      the fundamental result upon which most of our arguments depend",
    "is the existence of _ equivariant euclidean embeddings _ , proved in proposition  [ prop : tautembedding ] . to state",
    "this result , we first note that every element @xmath13 has a _ minimal subcomplex _ @xmath30 , and if @xmath15 is hyperbolic then this subcomplex admits a @xmath31invariant product decomposition @xmath32 .",
    "the action of @xmath15 on @xmath33 is trivial and every edge in @xmath34 is on a combinatorial axis for @xmath15 .",
    "we call @xmath34 the _ essential minimal set _ for @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , we show that @xmath34 is always a finite - dimensional cat(0 ) cube complex .",
    "however , @xmath34 is not always a convex subcomplex of @xmath6 .",
    "we denote by @xmath35 its convex hull in @xmath6 and refer to @xmath35 as the _ essential characteristic set _ for @xmath15 .",
    "the subcomplex @xmath35 is in general much more complicated than @xmath34 and can have infinite dimension . in section  [ sec : charsets ] , we give a complete characterization of when @xmath35 is finite - dimensional and when @xmath35 and @xmath34 are the same .",
    "proposition  [ prop : tautembedding ] states that if @xmath15 is hyperbolic and @xmath35 is finite - dimensional , then there is a @xmath31equivariant embedding of @xmath35 into @xmath36 , where @xmath37 . that is , there is an embedding of cube complexes @xmath38 such that the action of @xmath31 on @xmath35 extends to an action on @xmath36 ( preserving its standard cubing ) .",
    "furthermore , the embedding induces a bijection between the half - spaces of @xmath35 and those of @xmath36 .",
    "it is well known that any interval in a cat(0 ) cube complex admits an embedding into @xmath36 for some @xmath39 .",
    "this result is proved using dilworth s theorem on partially ordered sets of finite width ; see @xcite for details .",
    "what is new in our result is the equivariance . in order to prove it , we first state and prove an equivariant version of dilworth s theorem , lemma  [ lem : equidilworth ] .",
    "an important aspect of the equivariant euclidean embedding is that it provides a geometric framework for understanding the fine structure of the set of half - spaces of @xmath35 , considered as a partially ordered set .",
    "this set becomes identified with the set of half - spaces of @xmath36 , and the partial ordering from @xmath35 is determined by the knowledge of which cubes in @xmath36 are occupied by @xmath35 ( cf .",
    "remark  [ rem : square ] ) .",
    "tools such as the quadrant lemma and the elbow lemma ( see section  [ sec : quadrants ] ) can be used to retrieve information about the partial ordering .",
    "these tools become available once @xmath35 has been embedded into @xmath36 .      in section  [ sec : prelim ] we present background on several topics , including quasimorphisms and stable commutator length , cat(0 ) cube complexes , and right - angled artin groups .    in section  [ sec : charsets ] we define the _ essential minimal set _ and the _ essential characteristic set _ , and establish their properties .",
    "we determine when they agree , and when the latter has finite dimension .    in section  [ sec : dilworth ]",
    "we prove the equivariant dilworth theorem , and apply it to prove the existence of equivariant euclidean embeddings of essential characteristic sets .",
    "in section  [ sec : quadrants ] we introduce _ quadrants _ and prove two basic results , the quadrant lemma and the elbow lemma .",
    "these are the primary tools used for studying the essential characteristic set @xmath35 once it has been equivariantly embedded into @xmath36 .    in section  [ sec :",
    "non - transverse ] we define _ non - transverse _ actions . for such actions",
    "we also define the quasimorphisms @xmath40 and @xmath9 and establish the bounds on defect , using medians .",
    "in section  [ sec : raag - like ] we discuss _ raag - like _ actions on cat(0 ) cube complexes .    in sections [ sec : tightlynested ] and [ sec : last ]",
    "we carry out the rather intricate arguments needed to show that @xmath41 for the appropriate choice of @xmath8 .",
