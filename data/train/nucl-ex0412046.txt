    "change in nuclear shape from an oblate one with the spin parallel to the symmetry axis to an elongated prolate or triaxial one , accompanied by the collective rotation around the shortest axis , called jacobi shape transition , has been predicted to appear in many nuclei at angular momenta close to the fission limit .",
    "the presence of elongated shapes has been indicated in the @xmath0-decay of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) in @xmath5ti nucleus  @xcite . in this article",
    "we show further observations , which confirm this finding .",
    "the simulation of the gdr strength function based on the lublin - strasbourg drop ( lsd ) model  @xcite , when inserted to the statistical evaporation code cascade , results in a high - energy @xmath0-spectrum very similar to the experimental one . the low energy component of the gdr strength function is interpreted as a result of both large deformation effects and coriolis splitting of the gdr .",
    "moreover , the low energy component of the gdr has been found to feed preferentially the highly - deformed band  @xcite in @xmath4ca .",
    "the experiment  @xcite was performed at the vivitron accelerator of the ires laboratory , in strasbourg ( france ) , using the euroball  iv ge - array  @xcite coupled to the baf@xmath6 hector array  @xcite .",
    "the master trigger condition was highly selective - accepted were only the events having at least two ge signals of euroball , bgo - shield suppressed , and one high - energy @xmath0-ray in baf@xmath6 detector of hector .",
    "the @xmath5ti compound nucleus was populated in the @xmath1o+@xmath2si reaction at 105  mev bombarding energy .",
    "the excitation energy of the @xmath5ti nuclei was 86  mev and the maximum angular momentum , @xmath7  35  @xmath8 .",
    "the gdr spectrum measured by hector detectors , gated on known well resolved low energy @xmath0-ray transitions of @xmath4ca detected in euroball , is shown in fig .",
    "this gating condition , together with the highly selective master trigger condition , allowed to select high energy @xmath0-rays coming from nuclei with the highest spins ( @xmath9  20  @xmath8 ) and free from fission and direct reactions contaminations .",
    "the high - energy @xmath0-ray spectrum was analysed using a modified monte - carlo version of the statistical model code cascade  @xcite .",
    "the gdr line shape given by the absorption cross - section extracted using the method described in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "the found strength function is split forming a narrow low - energy component around 10  mev , and a broad structure ranging from 15 to 27  mev .",
    "this splitting was interpreted  @xcite as the consequence of both the jacobi shape transition in which an oblate nucleus , with a non - collective rotation transforms ( around spin @xmath10  =  28  @xmath8 ) to a very elongated prolate one rotating collectively , and strong coriolis effects which split the low energy component ( at @xmath3  13 mev ) by @xmath11  @xmath3  6  mev",
    "( where @xmath12 is the rotational frequency ) and shift a part of its strength down to @xmath310  mev .",
    "in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite presented the first clear observation of the coriolis effects in hot nuclei .    in order to confirm this interpretation , in the following we compare the experimental spectrum with the calculated spectra",
    "in which the gdr strength function is simulated according to the theoretical predictions of the nuclear shape .",
    "the simulations are done using the method of the thermal shape fluctuations ( viz . ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) based on the free energies from the newest version of the liquid drop model lsd  @xcite , and on the microscopic single - particle spectra from the deformed woods - saxon hamiltonian with the _ universal _ parameters . in the calculations",
    "@xcite , we include the possibility of coriolis splitting of the gdr strength function for a given spin and a deformation value .",
    "thus , the gdr line shape consists , in general , of 5-lorentzian parametrisation  @xcite .",
    "the results of the simulation for the spin region @xmath10  @xmath9  26@xmath13 , where the jacobi transition is predicted to occur , are presented as open squares in fig .",
    "1b ,  1c , and denoted as `` lsd sim '' . in fig .",
    "1b the coriolis splitting of the gdr components was not included while it was done for calculations shown in fig .",
    "the latter are indeed similar to the experimental results for the gdr strength function ( fig .",
    "1a - inset ) , and also exhibit the narrow 10  mev component and a broad structure at higher energies . for comparison , the calculated gdr line shape for @xmath10  =  24  @xmath8 , i.e. in the region where the small oblate deformation is expected ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "1d .    the simulated gdr strength function can be used in the statistical model calculations .",
    "we have modified the monte - carlo version of the code cascade , so that the gdr strength function is parameterised by 5 components , each defined by a gdr centroid , a width and a strength .",
    "those 15 input parameters have been obtained by fitting the simulated gdr strength functions ( fig .  1b ,  c ,  d ) with a 5-component lorentz function - which is shown in fig .  1b , 1c and 1d by dash - dotted , solid and broken lines , respectively .",
    "the theoretical spectra resulting from the cascade calculations are shown also in fig .  1a together with the experimental data .",
    "as can be seen , the calculations done for the spin range 26 - 34  @xmath8 taking into account the coriolis splitting of the gdr components are in very good agreement with the experimental spectrum , while the one without coriolis splitting assumption or the one for @xmath10  =  24  @xmath8 are in full disagreement .",
    "this gives the additional confirmation of the observation of the jacobi shape transition in the hot @xmath5ti and the coriolis splitting of the gdr .    in this context",
    "it is worth to mention , that very large deformations of @xmath5ti at high angular momenta were also suggested by the measured spectra of emitted @xmath14-particles  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the gdr feeding of the normal - deformed bands and the highly - deformed ( possibly super - deformed ) collective band in @xmath4ca  @xcite was investigated . to see how the different regions of high - energy @xmath0-rays feed the discrete lines in @xmath4ca residual nucleus",
    ", the gates ( 1  mev wide ) were set on the gdr spectrum and with such a condition the discrete line intensities were analysed .",
    "the three ratios between intensities of different discrete transition ( normal deformed , highly - deformed and spherical ) were taken into account .",
    "they are plotted as functions of the gdr energy in fig .  2 after an arbitrary normalisation to 1 at 4.5  mev .",
    "as clearly seen , the ratio between @xmath0-intensities from the highly - deformed ( denoted as `` hd '' ) and normal - deformed ( `` nd '' ) bands ( solid points ) shows a bump in the region 8 - 9  mev . in this region the ratio is larger by a factor of 2 as compared to the low energy ( statistical ) region , and by a factor almost 4 as compared to the normal gdr region ( @xmath912  mev ) .",
    "an enhancement , but smaller , is seen also in the ratio of the intensities of transitions within the `` hd''-band and in the spherical ( `` spher '' ) part of the level scheme ( open squares ) , while there is no bump present in the `` nd / spher '' ratio case ( open triangles ) . considering that the gates were set on the raw spectrum , not corrected for the detector s response function , this 8 - 9 mev bump corresponds to the 10  mev low energy component of the gdr strength function shown in fig .",
    "this might indicate that the low energy component of the coriolis split gdr in the _ hot _ compound nucleus @xmath5ti feeds preferentially the highly - deformed ( presumably super - deformed ) band in the _ cold _ @xmath4ca evaporation residue .",
    "similar effect has been observed in the @xmath15eu case  @xcite .",
    "this seems to confirm the old hypothesis  @xcite of a special role played by the low energy gdr component in feeding the super - deformed yrast structures .",
    "the high - energy @xmath0-ray spectrum from the @xmath5ti compound nucleus measured in coincidence with discrete transitions in the @xmath4ca residues shows highly fragmented gdr strength function with a broad 15 - 25 mev structure and a narrow low - energy 10  mev component .",
    "this can be interpreted as the result of the jacobi shape transition and strong coriolis effects , seen experimentally for the first time .",
    "in addition , the low energy gdr component seems to feed preferentially the highly - deformed band in @xmath4ca .",
    "this suggests that the very deformed shapes of hot compound nucleus , resulting from the jacobi shape transition , persist in the entire evaporation process .",
    "thus , the mechanism of the jacobi shape transition might indeed constitute a gateway to the production of the very elongated , rapidly rotating and relatively cold nuclei , as advocated in ref .",
