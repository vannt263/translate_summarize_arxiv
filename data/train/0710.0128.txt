    "the faraday effect causes a rotation of the plane of linear polarisation , described by : @xmath0 , with the rotation measure ( rm ) determined by the integral of the electron density and the dot product of the magnetic ( b ) field and the path length along the line of sight ( los ) . a positive / negative",

    "previous results indicated the presence of different rm signs in the core regions of 6 blazars in different wavelength intervals ( osullivan & gabuzda 2006 ) .",
    "this has two main possible origins : ( 1 ) the los b - field changes with distance from the centre of activity , or ( 2 ) since the previous observations were not simultaneous , it could be due to an intrinsic change in the overall jet b - field structure between observing epochs .",
    "our new 8 wavelength observations are designed to test these possibilities .",
    "multi - wavelength ( 6.5 , 5.9 , 3.8 , 3.4 , 2.3 , 1.9 , 1.3 cm & 7 mm ) , simultaneous polarisation observations of 6 `` blazars '' ( 0954 + 658 , 1156 + 295 , 1418 + 546 , 1749 + 096 , 2007 + 777 , 2200 + 420 ) were obtained on the vlba over a 24-hr period on 2 july 2006 .",
    "the calibration and imaging were done in aips using standard techniques .",
    "the integrated ( galactic ) rms were subtracted , to better isolate the rm distribution in the immediate vicinity of the agns ( pushkarev 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "matched - resolution images were constructed for two seperate wavelength intervals using the 5.9-cm beamsize for the longer wavelength interval and the 1.9-cm beamsize for the shorter wavelength interval .",
    "this was done to obtain more reliable information about the rm distribution and b - field in the long and short wavelength regimes , as can be seen from the plot of @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 for 1156 + 295 for the whole wavelength range in figure 1 .",

    "the inner - jet has changed from a southwesterly direction in our 7 august 2002 observations ( gabuzda et al .",
    "2006 ) to directly southwards in our current observations , consistent with the `` precessing nozzle '' proposed by stirling et al .",
    "the rm map from 6.5-cm to 2.3-cm ( fig.2 ) shows a large positive value of @xmath32 @xmath33 at the northern end , which we consider to be the true core , since our spectral index map ( corrected for the frequency dependent core shift ; see lobanov 1998 ) shows this region as being most optically thick ; a negative rm of @xmath34 @xmath33 is observed just south of this region , while the rest of the jet has a low rm ( essentially equal to zero within the errors ) consistent with a much lower electron density in the vicinity of the optically thin jet .",
    "the rm map of 2200 + 420 from 7-mm to 1.9-cm ( fig.3 ) displays an rm of @xmath35 @xmath33 in the core , which is larger in magnitude and different in sign than the observed northernmost rm for the longer wavelength data .",
    "the inner - jet rm has a smaller value of @xmath36 @xmath33 ; these regions probably correspond to the region of negative rm near the core in the longer wavelength rm map ( fig.2 ) .",
    "an interesting feature in fig.3 is the high , positive rm detected at the eastern edge of the jet in the region where the it bends , possibly indicating interation with the surrounding medium .",
    "the fact that the faraday corrected polarisation vectors for 2200 + 420 from both frequency intervals ( fig.4 ) remain well aligned with the jet even as it goes through substantial bending can be understood if the implied transverse b - field represents the toroidal component of a helical field .",
    "1418 + 546 is the only source in this sample with jet polarisation perpendicular to the jet direction ( table 1 ) .",
    "this behaviour of the jet evpas is also natural if the jets have helical b - fields ( lyutikov et al .",
    "2005 ) , where polarisation perpendicular to the jet direction occurs when the poloidal component of the helical b - field dominates .",
    "a transverse rm gradient was detected in the jet of 0954 + 658 , which is a strong signature of the presence of a helical b - field surrounding the jet , confirmed by the results of mahmud & gabuzda 2007 ( these proceedings ) .",
    "our results for 2200 + 420 confirm the presence of an rm sign reversal in the core region .",
    "since the dominant jet b - field is transverse to the jet and remains transverse while the jet bends , we will suppose a helical b - field surrounds the jet .",
    "the observed rm sign reversal can be explained by a slight bend of the jet , due , for example , to a collision with material in the parent galaxy or some instabilities inherent in the jet itself .",
    "( a longitudinal jet b - field with a change in the angle to the line of sight could also cause a rm sign reversal , but this does not correspond to the observed b - field . )    a side - on view of a helical b - field ( fig.1 top right ) will have a rm that will be equally strong on both sides of the jet , hence , a zero net rm will be observed for an unresolved jet .",
    "this would occur when the source is viewed at @xmath37 in the observer s frame . for a tail - on view of a helical b - field ( ie .",
    "@xmath38 ) ( fig.1 middle ) , the dominant rm will be from the bottom half of the jet and a negative rm will be observed because the dominant los b - field will be pointing away from us .",
    "( assuming the jet is not fully resolved in the transverse direction . )",
    "conversely , for a head - on view of a helical b - field ( ie .",
    "@xmath39 ) ( fig.1 bottom ) , a positive rm will be observed .",
    "therefore , regions with different rm signs in the jets of agn can be explained within a helical b - field model as places where the jet is observed at angles greater than or less than @xmath40 , due to bends in the jet .",
    "since vlbi resolution is usually not sufficient to completely resolve the true optically thick core , the vlbi `` core '' consists of emission from the true core and some of the optically thin inner - jet .",
    "so if bends occur on scales smaller than the observed vlbi core , `` core '' rms with different signs could be derived from observations at different wavelengths ( ie .",
    "probing different scales of the inner - jet ) . in our future work ,",
    "we will attempt to reconstruct the 3d path of the jet through space using the combined information from the observed distributions of the total intensity , linear polarisation , spectral index and rotation measure .    funding for this research was provided by the irish research council for science , engineering and technology .",
