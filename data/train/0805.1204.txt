    "multifragmentation is the process by which a heavy nucleus excited through nuclear collision decays into nuclear fragments with a range of atomic masses and energies .",
    "first observed in cosmic ray emulsion experiments as a starburst of grey and black emulsion tracks emanating from a single incident track , it has since been studied using beams of projectiles including single hadrons ( pions , protons , and antiprotons ) , light ions , and heavy ions accelerated to energies ranging from a few hundred mev up to tevatron energies of 350  gev  @xcite .",
    "analysis of the hadron - induced reactions suggests a fast evolutionary mechanism that is dominated by two stages  @xcite .",
    "initially the system is heated by a prompt nuclear cascade that produces high - energy , forward peaked particles , commonly identified as grey particles , named according to their appearance in emulsion .",
    "the system then cools via preequilibrium particle emission , leading to the second major stage , an excited , thermalized nuclear residue that subsequently undergoes statistical decay .",
    "analyses of the second stage emission products indicate that for events that deposit the highest excitation energies , the residue undergoes multifragment decay on a near - instantaneous time scale  @xcite , consistent with a nuclear liquid - gas phase transition and perhaps critical behavior  @xcite .    the process of multifragmentation has been thoroughly investigated as a function of incident beam energy  @xcite and projectile species  @xcite , but a systematic study of its centrality dependence has not yet been performed . in heavy ion collisions , the experimental definition of centrality usually refers to the mean number of primary collisions or the impact parameter distribution extracted from forward particle multiplicities using a standardized set of assumptions , and it is often used to characterize nuclear collisions at gev energies and above  @xcite .",
    "centrality analyses often provide useful insights into particle production mechanisms and enable systematic comparisons with other experiments and theoretical models , where comparable measures of centrality can be precisely determined .",
    "the isis multifragmentation program at the brookhaven national laboratory alternating gradient synchrotron ( bnl  ags ) with its large acceptance and event - by - event charged particle identification is ideally suited to study the centrality dependence of multifragmentation . in this paper we present results from the first multifragmentation centrality analysis using the data from the isis experiments",
    "e900 and e900a .",
    "the experimental grey particle and excitation energy distributions were obtained at the ags using secondary beams of untagged 14.6 gev / c protons and tagged beams of 8.0 gev / c @xmath3 and antiprotons incident on a @xmath4au target .",
    "the highest energy data sets for each beam species were selected to optimize the glauber model assumptions required for the centrality analysis .",
    "reaction products were measured with the isis detector array , which consists of 162 triple detector telescopes arranged in a spherical geometry and covering 74% of 4@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "detector telescopes were composed of a low - pressure gas ionization chamber , followed by a 500  @xmath6 m silicon detector for measuring low - energy fragments and a 28  mm csi crystal for detecting more energetic particles .",
    "telescopes provided charge identification for 1.0@xmath7e / a@xmath790  mev reaction products and particle identification in the range 8.0@xmath7e / a@xmath792  mev , primarily hydrogen and helium isotopes .    of particular relevance to the present study , the kinetic energy of particles that punched through the csi crystal was derived from the csi energy loss in the si - csi particle - identification spectrum and energy - loss tables .",
    "this procedure permitted identification of particles up to 350 mev in energy , which were assumed to be primarily hydrogen nuclei and were classified as grey particles .",
    "full description of the experimental details , data analysis , calorimetry procedures and error estimates are given in  @xcite .",
    "we follow the procedure developed by bnl - e910  @xcite , in which the conditional probability for the grey track distribution as function of the number of hadron - nucleon scatterings ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 , was determined by a fit to the measured grey particle distributions . here",

    "[ eq : ss2 ] preserves the dominant linear term of the second order polynomial used in  @xcite , but accommodates the @xmath0 saturation in a more natural way .",
    "@xmath0 was defined as the number of identified protons with 30@xmath7e@xmath7350  mev .",
    "this energy range is meant to separate fast and thermal protons , and is consistent with previous definitions of @xmath0 .",
    "the lower energy cut is identical to the one used by bnl - e910 , although their high energy cut of 585  mev is higher than that used by most experiments .",
    "the dependence on the low energy cut is included in the study of systematic errors .",
    "the full functional form is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : binom ] , @xmath12 the @xmath13 glauber distribution for the number of primary hadron - nucleon interactions is calculated with a monte carlo optical model  @xcite using a wood - saxon nuclear density profile assuming free inelastic cross - sections for protons at 14.6 gev / c and pions and antiprotons at 8.0  gev / c , given in the particle data book as 30 , 20 , and 47  mb , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the glauber distribution for the e900 data set includes a 10% admixture of 14.6  gev / c pions  @xcite , also using a 20  mb cross - section .",

    "[ eq : binom ] with @xmath15 set to unity ( dashed ) and to the second order polynomial ( dotted ) used in  @xcite .",

    "was estimated to be 1020% , with the dominant contribution coming from the lower momentum bound in the @xmath0 definition .",
    "for this reason we also performed fits to the combined fast and thermal proton distributions 8@xmath7e@xmath7350  mev , shown in the fig .",

    "note for the fast deuteron and triton definitions , the low energy cut is set to 49  mev rather than 30  mev used for protons .",
    "the systematic error estimate also includes fits with cross - sections varied by @xmath16  mb .",
    "the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are given by , @xmath17     distributions with three definitions : fast protons ( a , b , c ) , fast protons , deutrons and tritons ( d , e , f ) and fast and thermal protons ( h , i , j ) .",

    "the systematic error bands are centered about the mean for the set of all variations , leading to a slight displacement from the standard analysis values that is most prominent for the pions .",
    "the dependence of e*/a on @xmath0 is approximately linear and nearly uniform for the three systems , with a slightly higher energy deposition for the antiprotons .",

    "this is consistent with the two stage multifragmentation process , in which a prompt intranuclear cascade depletes and excites the remnant nucleus which then fragments and decays .",
    "the different dependences on @xmath1 and @xmath2 serve to illustrate the importance of the collision geometry in understanding how the cascade develops from the initial primary collisions .",
