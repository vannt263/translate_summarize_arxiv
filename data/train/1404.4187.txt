    "the question of the evolution of a random walk in a disordered environment has attracted a lot of attention in both the mathematical and the physical communities over the past few decades .",
    "the first studies were concerned with static random environments . in this",
    "set - up , anomalous slowdowns are expected in comparison with the homogeneous case , as the environment may create traps where the walker gets stuck for long times .",
    "this effect is particularly strong in one dimension , where it is by now well understood ( see @xcite for background ) . in dynamical random environments instead , the transition probabilities of the walker evolve with time too .",
    "if the environment has good space - time mixing properties , one expects the trapping phenomenon to disappear , and the walker to behave very much as if the medium was homogeneous .",
    "the study of this case has recently led to intense researches ; see for example @xcite and references therein , as well as @xcite for an overview and further references .",
    "however , examples of dynamical environments with slow relaxation times occur naturally",
    ". indeed , in the presence of a macroscopically conserved quantity , the environment may evolve diffusively .",
    "time correlations then only decay as @xmath3 in dimension @xmath4 . especially for @xmath5 ,",
    "correlations decay so slowly that the results developed for fast mixing environments do not apply ( see e.g. @xcite ) . slowly mixing environments",
    "form an intermediate class of models , which is still far for being well understood at the present time @xcite .    in this paper , we are interested in the asymptotic behavior as @xmath6 of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the position at time @xmath9 of a walker driven by the one - dimensional simple exclusion process , at equilibrium with density @xmath10 .",
    "the walker evolves in discrete time : if he sits on a particle at the moment of jumping , he moves to the right with probability @xmath11 and to the left with probability @xmath12 for some @xmath13 , while , if he sits on a vacant site , these probabilities become respectively @xmath14 and @xmath15 for some @xmath16 ( see figure [ figure : walker ] , as well as section [ subsec : model ] below for a more rigorous description ) . of particular interest",
    "is the case @xmath17 or vice versa , as we then see reappearing the possibility of trapping mechanisms .",

    "two regimes , depending on the value of @xmath0 , are considered in this article .",
    "we first deal with the fluid regime @xmath20 . in the formal limit  @xmath21 \" , the walker evolves as in an homogeneous medium : he jumps to the right with the homogenized probability @xmath22 and to the left with probability @xmath23 .",
    "we assume @xmath24 , and say @xmath25 to fix things .",
    "the walker drifts thus to the right in the limiting case  @xmath21 \" and the fluctuations are normal .",
    "let us now take @xmath26 .",
    "in the time interval left between each step of the walker , the exclusion process mixes the particles in boxes of size @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , most of the time , the walk will behave in the same way as the limiting homogeneous walk .",
    "however , the walker will eventually enter some regions where the density of particles is anomalously high or small , and behave then differently .",
    "but regions of size @xmath28 with an anomalous density of particles ( with respect to the equilibrium measure ) are typically at distance @xmath29 from the origin for some @xmath30 , while only a time of order @xmath31 is needed for the dynamics to disaggregate them .",
    "therefore , these regions do not act as efficient barriers to the evolution of the walker , which exhibits thus a positive asymptotic velocity .",
    "this is made precise in theorem  [ theorem : drift to the right ] , where it is also shown that fluctuations are normal .",
    "we next deal with the quasi - static regime @xmath32 .",
    "the dynamics is then no longer dominated by the homogenized probability @xmath33 .",
    "instead of the condition @xmath24 , we now assume that , in the limiting static case @xmath2 , the walk is transient , say to the right ( see the criterium below , as well as chapter 2.1 in @xcite ) . under this hypothesis , when @xmath2 , it is known that @xmath8 behaves as @xmath34 as @xmath35 for some @xmath36 . the sub - ballistic behavior corresponding to cases where @xmath37 appears when @xmath38 and is due to the fluctuations of the environment ( see @xcite for precise results on this regime ) .",
    "let us now take @xmath39 .",
    "the environment does not evolve significantly over a time @xmath40 for some small @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , taking @xmath0 small enough , the walker will move to the right by an amount of order @xmath34 if started in a typical environment with respect to the gibbs measure .",
    "thus , as long as the walk evolves in such configurations of the environment , it drifts to the right .",
    "nevertheless , when entering a region where the density of particles is anomalous , its progression may be greatly slowed .",
    "however , since @xmath0 is positive , we may just reuse the argument developed for large @xmath0 and show that traps are irrelevant : large traps ( of size @xmath28 ) disappear on much shorter time scales ( @xmath42 ) than the time needed for the walker to see a next trap of that size ( a time at least of order @xmath43 for some @xmath44 , see section [ section : small gamma ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the walker has a positive velocity to the right , as stated in theorem [ theorem : drift to the left ] .",
    "again , we show also that fluctuations are normal .    from these two results ,",
    "we conclude that the value of the limiting velocity @xmath45 may change drastically between the large an small @xmath0 regimes .",
    "indeed , for some values @xmath46 , @xmath11 and @xmath14 , the walk is transient to the right in a static environment while the homogenized drift @xmath47 is negative ( take e.g. @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 small enough in and below ) . in this case",
    ", the asymptotic velocity in a static environment is necessarily zero ( jensen s inequality implies @xmath38 ) .",
    "therefore , it holds that @xmath52 , @xmath53 for small enough @xmath39 , and @xmath54 for large enough @xmath0 .    we did not show that @xmath45 converges to @xmath55 as @xmath0 goes to @xmath56 , nor to @xmath47 as @xmath0 goes to @xmath57 , but we expect both of these limits to hold .",
    "while the latter could be shown using the techniques of the present article , at the cost of slightly more involved estimates ( control on both excess and shortage of particles ) , some more work should be needed to check the continuity at @xmath56 .",
    "theorems [ theorem : drift to the right ] and [ theorem : drift to the left ] are shown in essentially the same way . in a first step , by means of a multi - scale analysis",
    ", we show recursively that the walker can pass larger and larger traps , allowing for a set of initial environments of larger and larger measure .",
    "the introduction of renormalization techniques to study random walks in random environments goes back to @xcite and @xcite , from where our strategy is inspired .",
    "a similar method is used in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for a slightly different approach ) . from this first step ,",
    "one concludes that the walker drifts almost surely to the left or to the right .",
    "the law of large numbers and the invariance principle are deduced in a second step .",
    "as the environment evolves only on diffusive time scales , a ballistic walker discovers fresh randomness most of the time . from this observation ,",
    "it is possible to build up a renewal structure , allowing to cut the full trajectory into pieces that are mutually independent .",
    "this idea was first introduced in @xcite for the case of a static i.i.d .",
    "environment , and further adapted by @xcite to deal with the case of static environments with good mixing properties .",
    "it was exploited in @xcite to obtain a law of large numbers for dynamic environments with good mixing rates , and then in @xcite for a one - dimensional diffusive environment . as this method",
    "is rather delicate and model dependent , we had to perform specific constructions and estimates ( see section [ section : proof of law of large numbers ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss some existing works that are directly related to our results .",
    "a rather comprehensive study of the model studied here was initiated in @xcite , where several conjectures , based on numerical computations and some heuristics , were presented .",
    "our theorem [ theorem : drift to the left ] answers negatively one of the  key open questions \" asked in ( 3.8 ) in @xcite ( for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the velocity of the walker is non - zero for all @xmath39 small enough ) .",
    "moreover , two dimensional analogs of our model have been studied in the physics literature . in @xcite , the differential mobility of a tagged particle driven by an external field",
    "is shown , by means of numerical computations , to undergo a transition from a quasi - static to a fluid regime as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "these two regimes are somehow analogous to the ones described by our theorem [ theorem : drift to the left ] and theorem [ theorem : drift to the right ] respectively . in addition , the same model was studied in @xcite as a way to probe the glassy transition in liquids , and the possibility of anomalous fluctuations was alluded .",
    "our results suggest that no anomalous fluctuation should be observed .",
    "finally , in a recent work @xcite , a law of large numbers and an invariance principle for the fluctuations of a walker were obtained in a set - up close to ours .",
    "the authors consider indeed a random walk driven by a set of non - interacting particles at equilibrium with density @xmath60 .",
    "the transition probability of the walker differs if he sits on a vacant site or on a site occupied by at least one particle .",
    "their results hold then for all @xmath46 large enough , assuming that the limiting velocity is non - zero in the limiting case  @xmath61 \" .",
    "this is thus a situation analogous to the one described by our theorem [ theorem : drift to the right ] , which proof is moreover based on a similar architecture as their .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that , even for theorem [ theorem : drift to the right ] , we developed our strategy independently , and that a closer look at the details shows that many steps can not be simply taken over .",
    "an environment is a function @xmath62 with values in the interval @xmath630,1[$ ] ; we refer to @xmath64 as the ( continuous ) time , and to @xmath65 as the position .",
    "given such a function @xmath66 we define , for any space - time point @xmath67 , the markovian ( discrete time ) law @xmath68 by @xmath69 given the discrete time process @xmath70 , we also define , with a slight abuse of notation , the continuous time process @xmath71 with @xmath64 .",
    "consider the simple exclusion process on @xmath18 , @xmath72 defined by its generator @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the jump rate of the particles ( the intensity of the process ) , and where @xmath75 is defined for any @xmath76 by @xmath77 if @xmath78 , the site @xmath79 is said to be occupied by a particle at time @xmath9 , while it is said to be vacant if @xmath80 .",
    "for any @xmath81 , the probability measure @xmath82 is invariant for the simple exclusion process .",
    "remark that for any @xmath79 , @xmath83 .",
    "we denote by @xmath84 the law of the process with initial condition distributed according to @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 . given a realization of @xmath87 we define an environment @xmath66 as a function of @xmath87 by @xmath88 we define @xmath89 , a law on the space of environments , as the push - forward of @xmath84 through this function . to fix the ideas",
    ", we will from now on assume that the drift corresponding to empty sites is larger than the drift corresponding to occupied sites : @xmath90 we define for any space - time point @xmath91 the annealed law by @xmath92 remark that the law of @xmath93 under @xmath94 is the same as the law of @xmath95 under @xmath96 , that we will often denote simply by @xmath97 .",
    "we assume that the environment is elliptic : @xmath98    for our first result , we assume that the walker would drift to the right if , at each of his step , the environment would be entirely refreshed according to the equilibrium measure ( the limiting case  @xmath1 \" ) .",
    "we assume thus that @xmath46 , @xmath11 and @xmath14 are such that @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the expectation with respect to @xmath97 and @xmath101 the expectation with respect to @xmath89 .",
    "we show that the drift to the right will still be observed if , instead of refreshing the environment at each step of the walker , it evolves according to the dynamics generated by with initial condition distributed as @xmath102 , provided that @xmath0 is taken large enough once the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath11 and @xmath14 have been fixed .",
    "the following theorem may therefore be seen as a perturbative result around the trivial case  @xmath1 \" :    [ theorem : drift to the right ] assume that the ellipticity condition and the drift condition hold .",

    ", we assume that the walker is transient to the right in a static environment ( @xmath108 ) , i.e. that the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath11 and @xmath14 are such that @xmath109 for background about static random walks in random environments , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we show that , for strictly positive and small enough @xmath0 , the walker has a positive velocity :    [ theorem : drift to the left ] assume that the ellipticity condition , as well as the condition for transience to the right in a static environment , hold .",

    "we stress that in the case where holds while the left hand side of is strictly positive , the asymptotic velocity of the walker can be either positive or negative according of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "we can thus exclude that any of our two theorems can be valid as such for all strictly positive @xmath0 .",
    "the rest of the article is organized in four sections . in section [ section :",
    "dissipation of traps ] , we control the time of dissipation of zones with high density of particles . in section [ section :",

    "finally , in section [ section : proof of law of large numbers ] , we build a renewal structure to show that the bounds obtained in sections [ section : drift to the right ] and [ section : small gamma ] imply the law of large numbers and the annealed invariance principle stated in theorems [ theorem : drift to the right ] and [ theorem : drift to the left ] .",
    "the walker can be slowed in the places where the concentration of particles is too high with respect to the expected density @xmath46 .",
    "these locally anomalous configurations of the environment are called traps . here",
    "we make precise the idea that traps disappear on diffusive time scales . concretely",
    ", we establish that , if in a box of size @xmath112 around a point @xmath79 , the density of particles is very close to the density @xmath46 for a given initial profile @xmath113 , then , waiting a time bigger than @xmath114 , the density in smaller boxes around @xmath79 becomes close to @xmath46 as well , with high probability with respect to the evolution of the process .",
    "the section is divided into three parts : we first state our results , then show some technical lemmas , and finally give the proof of our propositions .",
    "the technical estimates in section [ subsection : some lemmas ] are very close to some results obtained in @xcite ( see lemma 5.3 there ) .    before starting ,",
    "let us introduce an extra notation , to be in use mainly in sections [ section : dissipation of traps]-[section : small gamma ] .",
