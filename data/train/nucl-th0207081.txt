    "high - energy electron scattering from nuclei can provide important information on the wave function of nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "in particular , using simple assumptions about the reaction mechanism , scaling functions can be deduced that , if shown to scale ( i.e. , if they are independent of the momentum transfer ) , can provide information about the momentum and energy distribution of the nucleons .",
    "several theoretical studies @xcite have indicated that such measurements may provide direct access to studies of short - range nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) correlation effects .    since west s pioneer work @xcite , there has been a growth of interest in @xmath6-scaling analysis , both in its experimental and theoretical aspects .",
    "this is motivated by the importance of extracting nucleon momentum distributions from the experimental data .",
    "west showed that in the impulse approximation , if quasielastic scattering from a nucleon in the nucleus is a dominant reaction mechanism , a scaling function @xmath7 could be extracted from the measured cross section which is related to the momentum distribution of the nucleons . in the simplest approximation",
    "the corresponding scaling variable @xmath6 is the minimum momentum of the struck nucleon along the direction of the virtual photon . in principle",
    ", the scaling function @xmath8 depends on both @xmath6 and momentum transfer @xmath9 ( -@xmath9 is the square of the four - momentum transfer ) , but at sufficiently high @xmath9 values the dependence on @xmath9 should vanish yielding scaling .",
    "however , any attempt to extract the momentum distribution from the @xmath6-scaling in electron - nucleus scattering faces the problem of estimating both effects from the final - state interactions ( fsi ) of the struck nucleon with the rest of the nucleus and from the nucleon binding .",
    "previous calculations @xcite suggest that the contribution from the final - state interactions should vanish at sufficiently high @xmath9 .",
    "the fsi lead to sizable scaling violation effects only at low values of the three - momentum transfer @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the energy loss ) @xcite .",
    "the most important dynamical effects , such as binding corrections , which represent the fact that for complex nuclei the final spectator @xmath12 system can be left in all possible excited states including the continuum , have been treated in @xcite in terms of spectral functions .",
    "this problem has been solved in @xcite by introducing a new scaling variable which gives direct , global and independent of @xmath13 link between the experimental data and the longitudinal momentum components .",
    "recently inclusive electron scattering has been studied at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) with 4.045 gev incident beam energy from c , fe and au targets @xcite to @xmath9 @xmath14 7 ( gev / c)@xmath15 .",
    "data were also taken using liquid targets of hydrogen and deuterium @xcite .",
    "the data presented in @xcite represent a significant increase of the @xmath9 range compared to previous slac measurement @xcite , in which an approach to the scaling limit for heavy nuclei is suggested but for low values of @xmath16 0.3 gev at momentum transfers up to 3 ( gev / c)@xmath15 , and , moreover , a scaling behaviour is observed for the first time at very large negative @xmath6 ( @xmath6= -0.5 gev / c ) . from theoretical point of view",
    "the extended region of @xmath6 measured at tjnaf is of significant importance since this is a regime where the nucleon momentum distribution is expected to be dominated by short - range nn correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "it is interesting to note that contributions from short - range fsi may also result in a scaling - like behavior due to the small @xmath9 dependence of these effects , and that these contributions are also dominated by short - range correlations .",
    "obviously , a complete understanding of this electron - nucleus scattering requires a relativistic approach to the quantities related to the @xmath6-scaling analysis for a detailed comparison with the experimental data .",
    "a relativistic @xmath6-scaling has been considered in @xcite by generalizing the nonrelativistic scaling function to the relativistic case .",
    "realistic solutions of the spinor - spinor bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation for the deuteron with realistic interaction kernel were used for systematic investigation of the relativistic effects in inclusive quasielastic electron - deuteron scattering .",
    "the approach of @xmath6-scaling presented in @xcite is fully covariant , with the deuteron being described by eight components , namely the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 waves .",
    "the first two waves directly correspond to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 waves in the deuteron , with the waves with negative energy vanishing in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "it has been demonstrated in @xcite that , if the effects from the negative energy @xmath25-states are disregarded , the concept of covariant momentum distribution can be introduced .",
    "recently a successful relativistic description of the nucleon momentum distribution in deuteron has been done @xcite within the light - front dynamics method @xcite .",
    "the most important result from the calculations in @xcite is the possibility of the lfd method to describe simultaneously both deuteron charge form factors ( that has been shown in @xcite ) and the momentum distribution .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that after the projection of the bethe - salpeter amplitude on the light front , the six components of the lfd deuteron wave function are expressed through integrals over the eight components of the deuteron bethe - salpeter amplitude .",
    "provided the nucleon - nucleon interaction is the same , these approaches incorporate by different methods the same relativistic dynamics .",
    "the wave functions in lfd are the direct relativistic generalization of the nonrelativistic ones in the sense that they are still the probability amplitudes .",
    "therefore they can be used in the relativistic nuclear physics ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of our work is using the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath26 obtained with the lfd method to calculate the deuteron scaling function .",
    "the result for the asymptotic function is compared with the recent tjnaf data measured at six values of @xmath9 . in particular , the scaling behavior observed for very large negative @xmath6 providing momenta higher than those corresponding to existing experimental data for @xmath26 may allow to distinguish the properties of the covariant lfd method from the potential approaches .",
    "the comparison with the bs result for the scaling function serves as a test for the consistency of both covariant approaches treating the deuteron relativistically in the case of @xmath6-scaling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the definition and the physical meaning of the scaling variable and the scaling function are briefly reviewed together with some basic relations between the nucleon spectral function , the scaling function and the momentum distribution .",
    "the results for the nucleon momentum distribution in deuteron obtained within the lfd method are given in section iii .",
    "the calculated lfd asymptotic scaling function of the deuteron is presented in section iv , where a comparison with the bethe - salpeter result and with some nonrelativistic calculations is also done .",
    "the summary of the present work is given in section v.",
    "the scaling function is defined as the ratio of the measured cross section to the off - shell electron - nucleon cross section multiplied by a kinematic factor : @xmath27^{1/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the number of protons and neutrons in the target nucleus , respectively , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the off - shell cross sections , and @xmath32 is the mass of the proton . in analysing quasielastic scattering in terms of the @xmath6-scaling a new variable @xmath33 is introduced .",
    "then the nuclear structure function which is determined using the spectral function @xmath34 as @xmath35 can be expressed in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath6 rather than @xmath36 and @xmath11 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : scf ] ) ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : strf ] ) @xmath37 is the nucleon removal energy with @xmath38 being the excitation energy of the final @xmath12 nucleon system .",
    "the most commonly used scaling variable @xmath6 is obtained @xcite starting from relativistic energy conservation , setting @xmath39 , @xmath40 and the excitation energy @xmath38=0 , and is defined through the equation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass of the target nucleus and @xmath43 is the mass of the @xmath12 nucleus .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 represents the longitudinal momentum of a nucleon having the minimum removal energy ( @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath38=0 ) .    at high values of @xmath36 a pure scaling regime",
    "is achieved , where @xmath45 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : strf ] ) becomes @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : limit ] ) the particular behavior of @xmath34 at large @xmath47 and @xmath48 is used in order to extend the upper limits of integration to infinity @xcite .    in the deuteron one",
    "always has @xmath38=0 , so that the spectral function is entirely determined by the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath49 , and , consequently , @xmath50 for any value of @xmath36 . the scaling function ( [ eq : limit ] ) reduces to the longitudinal momentum distribution @xmath51",
    "the relativistic deuteron wave function ( wf ) on the light - front @xmath52 depends on two vector variables : i ) the relative momentum @xmath53 and ii ) the unit vector @xmath54 along @xmath55 which determines the position of the light - front surface . due to this",
    ", the wf is determined by six invariant functions @xmath1 ( @xmath2=1, ...",
    ",6 ) instead of two ( @xmath3- and @xmath4-waves ) in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "each one of these functions depends on two scalar variables @xmath47 and @xmath56 . in lfd",
    "these six functions are calculated within the relativistic one - boson - exchange model . as shown in @xcite , in the nonrelativistic limit the functions @xmath57",
    "become negligible , @xmath58 do not depend on @xmath59 and turn into @xmath3- and @xmath4-waves ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) and the wave function @xmath52 becomes the usual nonrelativistic wave function .",
    "one of the most important properties of the functions @xmath62 found in @xcite is that for @xmath63 2@xmath642.5 @xmath65 the component @xmath66 ( being related mainly to @xmath67-exchange ) exceeds sufficiently the @xmath3- and @xmath4-waves .",
    "this fact is very important in the calculations of @xmath26 in deuteron as it will be shown below .",
    "the lfd calculations have shown ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that , as expected , the most important contributions to the total @xmath26 give terms related to the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath66 functions @xmath70 the contributions of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are compared in fig .",
    "it can be seen that , while the functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 give a good description of the @xmath6-scaling data of @xmath26 for @xmath75 @xmath65 ( like the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave functions in the nonrelativistic case ) , it is impossible to explain the high - momentum components of @xmath26 at @xmath76 @xmath65 without the contribution of the function @xmath66 .",
    "we note that the deviation of the total @xmath26 from the sum @xmath73 starts at @xmath47 around 1.8 @xmath65 .",
    "all this shows the important role of nn interactions which incorporate exchange of relativistic mesons in the case of the deuteron .    , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "are presented .",

    "[ fig2 ] the result for @xmath26 using the charge - dependent bonn potential @xcite is given and compared with the @xmath6-scaling data .",

    "this might be related to the fact that these potentials describe nn phase shifts up to larger energies ( e.g. the nijmegen - ii potential gives reasonable @xmath84 phase shifts up to 1.2 gev , while the charge - dependent one - boson exchange bonn potential fits the phase - shift data below 350 mev ) ; ii ) it can be seen from fig .",

    "in this section we present the results for the asymptotic scaling function of deuteron which is calculated by using of the lfd nucleon momentum distribution given in section iii .",
    "the scaling function for deuteron calculated within the lfd method is shown in fig .",
    "it is compared with the tjnaf experimental data @xcite for all measured angles .",
    "the @xmath9 values are given for bjorken @xmath87 and correspond to elastic scattering from a free nucleon .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the relativistic lfd scaling function is in good agreement with the data in the whole region of negative @xmath6 available . as known , the scaling breaks down for values of @xmath88 due to the dominance of other inelastic processes beyond the quasielastic scattering .",
    "our lfd deuteron scaling function is also compared in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] with the scaling function obtained within the bs formalism @xcite .",
    "a small difference between the two results is observed for @xmath89 mev / c but , at the same time , the theoretical lfd scaling function is closer to the experimental data in the same region of @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that both lfd and bs functions reveal similar behavior is a strong indication in favor of the consistency of the two relativistic covariant approaches in case of the @xmath6-scaling .",

    "we have already shown ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] of the present work ) that the results using these potentials explain very well ( with the exception of the charge - dependent bonn potential ) all the available data for @xmath26 up to @xmath90 @xmath65 exactly like the lfd method .",
    "however , it is concluded in @xcite that for @xmath86 @xmath65 the lfd results for @xmath26 deviate strongly from those of the calculations using nn potentials .",
    "here we would like to emphasize the existence of the same discrepancies between the scaling functions observed from the comparison in fig .",
    "it is shown that for @xmath5 400 mev / c both lfd and bs curves start to deviate from the nonrelativistic scaling functions . the result for @xmath0 calculated using",
    "the nijmegen - ii nn potential is in better agreement with the experimental data than those using other potentials .",
    "it is in accordance with the result for @xmath26 shown in fig .",
    "for instance , by a thorough comparison between the relativistic bethe - salpeter and the nonrelativistic scaling functions of deuteron it has been found in @xcite that the two functions start to sensibly differ also at @xmath5 400 mev / c .",
    "thus , the necessity to treat realistically the relativistic dynamics inside the deuteron in a way different from the potential approaches becomes apparent . in this sense , the results calculated for both momentum distribution and asymptotic scaling function confirm the abilities of the lfd method to describe with a good accuracy the experimental data measured at high momentum transfers .",
    "in the present paper inclusive electron - deuteron scattering data have been analyzed in terms of the @xmath6-scaling function within the light - front dynamics method . for this purpose ,",
    "the nucleon momentum distribution in deuteron has been used in order to calculate the asymptotic scaling function . for the trivial case of deuteron ,",
    "for which the structure function ( eq . [ eq : limit ] ) coincides with the longitudinal momentum distribution ( eq . [ eq : long ] ) we have found a good agreement of the calculated scaling function with the experimental data .",
    "thus , the concept of relativistic @xmath6-scaling can be introduced in the lfd relativistic description of inclusive quasielastic @xmath91 scattering , in the same way as it is done in the conventional nonrelativistic approach , i.e. by introducing a scaling function ( which , in the scaling regime , is nothing but the nucleon longitudinal momentum distribution ) , and in terms of the same variable @xmath6 .",
    "it has been pointed out that for @xmath5 400 mev / c the differences between the lfd and the nonrelativistic scaling functions are very large .    exploring the light - front dynamics",
    ", we continue in this paper our analysis of important deuteron characteristics .",
    "the effective inclusion of the relativistic nucleon dynamics and of short - range nn correlations can be better seen when analyzing electron scattering at high momentum transfer from complex nuclei , for which a proper theoretical @xmath6-scaling analysis is still lacking .",
    "although scaling violation effects due to final - state interactions sharply decrease with increasing momentum transfer , a consistent treatment of both fsi and nucleon binding must be made in order to perform a precise comparison with the new tjnaf data .",
