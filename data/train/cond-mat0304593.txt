    "teitel and jayaprakash presented the following scenario . in terms of the dual cg model ,",
    "the helicity modulus @xmath115 gets reduced from its @xmath124 value by fluctuations that produce dipole moments .",
    "if ising domains of typical size @xmath181 carried a total dipole moment proportional to their size , they would drive @xmath196 _ continuously _ due to the diverging @xmath181 as @xmath197 from below .",
    "however , in addition to these domain excitations , there are also pair excitations .",
    "the original kosterlitz - thouless instability criteria would imply that pairs unbind once @xmath115 falls below the critical value @xmath198 , which must happen at some @xmath1 _ below _",
    ". however , if one computes domain energies at @xmath124 ( and presumably the same holds for domain free energies at low @xmath122 ) , one finds that it is only the domains with _ vanishing _ total dipole moment that have energies which scale with the perimeter ; i.e. the only domains which are `` ising - like '' are those which carry no dipole moment and so can not give any reduction in @xmath115 !",
    "fortunately , once @xmath122 increases above @xmath4 , kink - antikink pairs on the boundary of the domain are free to unbind , and the ising domains can now acquire large dipole moments at no cost in free energy .",
    "the scenario of teitel and jayaprakash is now restored .",
    "this conclusion is in complete agreement with the numerical work of olsson @xcite , who finds two distinct transitions at @xmath0 , and argues that the non ising - like critical behavior claimed by some @xcite at @xmath2 is in fact an artifact of finite size effects .",
    "the kink - antikink unbinding transition may also have implications for the non - equilibrium steady state behavior of the system when the vortices are driven by a uniform force , such as is the case for a fully frustrated josephson junction array in an applied uniform d.c .",
    "current @xmath199 .",
    "since @xmath199 couples linearly to the total dipole moment of a domain @xmath200 , the force will can can lead to an instability @xcite in domain growth provided the free energy of exciting the domain scales less than linearly with @xmath200 . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the binding of kinks to antikinks prevents large dipole moments from building up on domains .",
    "the ising - like domains , whose free energy scales like the domain length @xmath103 , are only those domains whose total dipole moment vanishes , and hence these domains remain stable , and the ising - like order should persist at small drives . for @xmath201 , kink - antikink pairs can unbind , resulting in domains whose dipole moment may scale at least proportional to their length @xmath103 . in this case , when the current exceeds an amount proportional to the ising domain surface tension , domains will become unstable to growth and the ising - like order will be destroyed .",
