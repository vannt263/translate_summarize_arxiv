    "nuclear resonant scattering ( nrs ) of synchrotron radiation ( sr ) has become an established method for the study of nuclear hyperfine interaction during the last two decades @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is conventionally recorded as the time response of the nuclear ensemble following a short resonant synchrotron pulse , which simultaneously excites all resonant transitions between hyperfine - split nuclear sublevels .",
    "the observed beating frequencies are characteristic for the hyperfine fields in the specimen . as an alternative to nuclear resonant forward scattering of sr in time domain ,",
    "a heterodyne detection scheme was suggested @xcite .",
    "the two scatterers , viz .",
    "the one under investigation and as a reference sample a single - line mssbauer absorber , are mounted on a mssbauer drive .",
    "the heterodyne spectrum is the full time integral of the delayed counts , plotted as a function of the doppler velocity of the reference sample .",
    "an advantage of this experimental setup is the similarity of the spectra to those in the conventional energy - domain mssbauer spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "although conventional mssbauer spectroscopy delivers similar information on hyperfine interactions , the special properties of sr like high collimation , high degree of polarization and high brilliance increase the number of possible applications of nrs of sr .",
    "furthermore , the heterodyne setup allows for dense bunch modes of the synchrotron ( with bunch separation time much shorter than the nuclear lifetime ) , which are not suitable for time differential nrs experiments .",
    "undistorted time integration of the nuclear response can only be performed if the large non - resonant intensity contribution is extinguished .",
    "experimentally , this can be achieved by using radiation from a nuclear monochromator @xcite or by applying a polarizer / analizer setup @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , namely , `` stroboscopic detection '' , is based on appropriate time gating @xcite , i.e. , integration of the delayed time response in a periodic time window .",
    "the period @xmath2 of the observation time window after the sr pulse is chosen so that @xmath3 falls within the frequency range of the hyperfine interactions in the investigated specimen .",
    "this leads to new type of periodic resonances at certain doppler velocities that are shifted from the mssbauer resonances by @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being planck s constant , and @xmath6 an integer number indicating the stroboscopic order @xcite .",
    "the period @xmath2 should be selected according to the hyperfine spectral range , the synchrotron bunch period and the detector dead time @xcite .",
    "so far the theory of stroboscopic detection scheme has only been developed and discussed in detail for forward scattering geometry .",
    "the several applications of nrs in surface and thin - film magnetism that make use of the grazing incidence geometry @xcite call for computer programs that easily allow to fit data obtained by stroboscopic detection as well . in this geometry ,",
    "the interferences of the sr plane waves , scattered from the surface and interfaces of a stratified sample , provide information on the value , direction and topology of the internal fields in the sample with nanometer depth resolution .",
    "recently , interesting experiments have been performed using stroboscopic detection in the grazing incidence case @xcite , which demonstrates the potential of this method .",
    "grazing - incident nrs of sr , often called synchrotron mssbauer reflectometry ( smr ) @xcite , has been established in both time and angular regime @xcite , as time differential ( td ) and time integral ( ti ) smr , respectively . in the forward scattering channel ,",
    "the prompt electronic scattering homogeneously contributes to the stroboscopic spectrum and does not affect the spectral shape . for other scattering channels , including grazing incidence reflection ,",
    "the interference of the electronic and nuclear scattering provides further information .",
    "the stroboscopic smr line shape may considerably differ from the forward mssbauer spectrum , calling for a specialized computer code .",
    "the dynamical theory of x - ray scattering gives a self - consistent description of the radiation field in all scattering channels of the system of scatterers , taking all orders of multiple scattering into account .",
    "theories that expand the coherent elastic scattering to the case of sharp nuclear resonances @xcite have been applied to various scattering geometries .",
    "the simplest cases are the one - beam cases , such as forward and off - bragg scattering , and the two - beam cases , the bragg - laue scattering @xcite and the grazing incidence scattering @xcite . in the grazing incidence limit ,",
    "an optical model was derived from the dynamical theory @xcite , which has been implemented in numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "the reflectivity formulae given by and are suitable for fast numerical calculations in order to actually fit the experimental data @xcite and , as has been shown @xcite , this optical method is equivalent to that of the other approaches in the literature @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to develop the concept of the heterodyne / stroboscopic detection and to establish the formula that can be applied to any scattering channel , like forward scattering , bragg , off - bragg and grazing incidence scattering .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section , the heterodyne / stroboscopic intensity formula for the propagation of @xmath7photons in a medium containing both electronic and resonant nuclear scatterers",
    "is derived .",
    "the equivalence to the previously discussed calculations for the forward channel @xcite are shown and the important specific case of the stroboscopic grazing incidence reflection are outlined . in the third section ,",
    "features of the grazing incidence case are demonstrated by least - squares fitted experimental stroboscopic smr spectra on isotope - periodic @xmath0 $ ] and antiferromagnetically ordered @xmath1 $ ] multilayer films .",
    "the setup of a heterodyne / stroboscopic nrs of sr experiment includes two scatterers , the investigated specimen and an additional reference sample @xcite , the latter being mounted on a mssbauer drive ( in forward scattering geometry ) .",

    "note that , in panels d , the zeroth order resonances are considerably enhanced with respect to the @xmath140order stroboscopic resonances .",
    "this can be explained by an enhanced radiative coupling of the samples . since the radiative coupling does not contribute to the @xmath140order stroboscopic resonances",
    ", it only influences the baseline and the central resonances .    at the multilayer bragg reflections ( panel e ) , and at the total reflection peak ( panel c )",
    ", the suppression of the higher stroboscopic orders is much smaller , which means that the radiative coupling term is not dominating here .",
    "these spectra also show a left / right asymmetry due to the variation of the phase of the total scattering amplitude with energy .",
    "this latter allows for phase determination of the scattering amplitude from a set of stroboscopic smr spectra , which work will be published later .",
    "in summary , the concept of heterodyne / stroboscopic detection of nuclear resonance scattering was outlined for a general scattering channel , with special emphasis on the grazing incidence reflection case . in any non - forward scattering channel , the electronic scattering influences the nrs spectral shape , while in forward scattering , this is a mere multiplicative factor .",
    "the interplay between electronic and nuclear scattering , as a function of the scattering angle , facilitates the determination of the electronic and nuclear scattering amplitudes .",
    "the code of the present theory has been merged into the effi program @xcite , and was used in simultaneous data fitting of x - ray reflectivity , time integral reflectivity and stroboscopic smr spectra . similar to time differential smr , stroboscopic smr spectra have been shown to be sensitive to the direction of the hyperfine fields of the individual layers .",
