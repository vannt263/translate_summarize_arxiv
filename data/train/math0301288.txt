    "a fundamental result in the classification theory of projective algebraic varieties is the existence of the hilbert scheme , a projective scheme parameterizing closed subschemes of a fixed projective space , having a fixed hilbert polynomial . in this paper , we study two versions of the hilbert scheme , relevant to the classification of affine algebraic varieties @xmath4 equipped with an action of a reductive group @xmath0 .    in this",
    "setting , an analog of the hilbert polynomial is the representation of @xmath0 in the coordinate ring of @xmath4 .",
    "this rational , possibly infinite - dimensional @xmath0-module is the direct sum of simple modules , with multiplicities that we assume to be all finite . now",
    "the closed @xmath0-stable subschemes of a fixed finite - dimensional @xmath0-module @xmath1 , having fixed multiplicities in their coordinate ring , are parameterized by a quasi - projective scheme : the invariant hilbert scheme @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 encodes the multiplicities ) .    for subschemes of finite length",
    ", the invariant hilbert scheme may be realized in a punctual hilbert scheme @xmath7 , as a union of connected components of the @xmath0-invariant subscheme .",
    "this construction is well known in the case of finite groups , see e.g. @xcite . but its generalization to arbitrary subschemes is problematic , since there is no reasonable moduli space for closed subschemes of infinite length in affine space . in that setting ,",
    "the existence of the invariant hilbert scheme was proved by haiman and sturmfels @xcite for diagonalizable groups , and ( building on their work ) in @xcite for connected reductive groups .",
    "the connectedness assumption for @xmath0 is harmless and will be made throughout this paper .",
    "we first present an alternative proof for the existence of @xmath5 , by realizing it as a closed subscheme of @xmath8 ; here @xmath9 is a maximal torus , @xmath10 is a maximal unipotent subgroup normalized by @xmath2 , and @xmath11 is the categorical quotient .",
    "( since @xmath11 is an affine @xmath2-variety , the existence of @xmath8 follows from @xcite . )",
    "this enables us to construct another version of the hilbert scheme : it classifies affine @xmath0-schemes @xmath4 equipped with a @xmath2-equivariant isomorphism @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a fixed affine @xmath2-scheme ( we then say that @xmath4 has type @xmath14 ) . this moduli scheme @xmath15",
    "may be described more concretely , in terms of the rational @xmath0-module @xmath16 such that the @xmath17-fixed subspace in @xmath16 ( the span of the highest weight vectors ) equals @xmath18 : in fact , @xmath15 parameterizes those algebra multiplication laws on @xmath16 that are @xmath0-equivariant and extend the multiplication of @xmath18 .",
    "we show that @xmath15 is an affine scheme of finite type , and we equip it with an action of the adjoint torus @xmath19 ( the quotient of @xmath2 by the center of @xmath0 ) such that all orbit closures have a common point @xmath20 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the `` most degenerate multiplication law '' on @xmath16 , where the product of any two simple submodules is generated by the product of their highest weight vectors .",
    "equivalently , @xmath20 is horospherical in the sense of @xcite .",
    "these properties of @xmath15 follow easily from its description in terms of multiplication laws , except for the crucial fact that @xmath15 is of finite type .",
    "so we use an indirect approach which relates @xmath15 to an invariant hilbert scheme : every algebra @xmath16 as above is generated by any @xmath0-submodule containing a set of generators for @xmath18 , so that @xmath21 is equipped with a closed immersion into a fixed @xmath0-module @xmath1 . and ,",
    "of course , the multiplicities of the @xmath0-module @xmath16 are fixed , since its highest weight vectors are .",
    "specifically , we define an open subscheme @xmath22 of the invariant hilbert scheme , equipped with a morphism @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the space of co - invariants of @xmath17 in @xmath1 .",
    "we show that @xmath15 identifies with the fiber of @xmath25 at @xmath14 , for any closed @xmath2-stable subscheme @xmath14 of @xmath24 .",
    "then we define an action of @xmath19 on @xmath5 that stabilizes @xmath22 ; it turns out that @xmath25 is a good quotient in the sense of geometric invariant theory .",
    "in addition ,",
    "the `` most degenerate multiplication law '' yields a @xmath19-invariant section @xmath26 of @xmath25 .",
    "the construction of @xmath15 gives new insight into several methods and results concerning reductive group actions .",
    "for example , the degeneration of an affine @xmath0-variety @xmath4 to a horospherical one @xmath20 , which plays an important role in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , is obtained by taking the @xmath19-orbit closure of @xmath4 in @xmath15 where @xmath27 .",
    "consider the normalization of this orbit closure , an affine toric variety ; then a deep result of knop @xcite implies that the corresponding monoid ( of characters ) is generated by all simple roots of a certain root system @xmath28 . as a consequence ,",
    "the normalization of any @xmath19-orbit in @xmath15 is isomorphic to a @xmath19-module .    of special interest",
    "are the multiplicity - free @xmath0-varieties , i.e. , those affine @xmath0-varieties such that all multiplicities of their coordinate ring are @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a torus , then these varieties are the ( possibly non - normal ) toric varieties , and the corresponding invariant hilbert scheme is the toric hilbert scheme of peeva and stillman @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "for arbitrary @xmath0 , we show that every finite - dimensional @xmath0-module @xmath1 contains only finitely many multiplicity - free subvarieties , up to the action of the centralizer of @xmath0 in @xmath3 . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath15 contains only finitely may @xmath19-orbits , for any multiplicity - free @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , those moduli schemes arising from reductive varieties ( a nice class of multiplicity - free varieties , studied in @xcite ) turn out to be isomorphic to affine spaces , via the vinberg family of @xcite .",
