    "thanks to its grazing incidence optics , _ nustar _ ( harrison et al . 2013 ) is providing , for the first time , source - dominated hard x - ray ( @xmath310 kev ) observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the hard x - ray spectra can thus be studied in much greater detail than before , and spectral parameters determined with unprecedented precision and robustness .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray spectra of ( radio - quiet ) agn is believed to be produced by comptonization of the accretion disk photons in a hot corona , with coronal temperatures well in excess of 10 kev ( e.g. perola et al .",
    "2002 , malizia et al .",
    "one of the main goals of the _ nustar _ agn program is to determine the coronal parameters ( temperature , optical depth , location , geometry ) and , at the very least , the exponential high - energy cutoff which , together with the power law index , encodes information about these parameters .    precise measurements of the high - energy cutoff ( brenneman et al .",

    "in this paper we study the high - energy spectrum of the bright , nearby ( @xmath4=0.006181 ) compton - thin ( wang et al . 1999 ) narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nagar et al . 2002 ) , ngc  5506 .",

    "2012 for _ suzaku _ results ) .",
    "simultaneous xmm-_newton _ and _ bepposax _ observations permitted the search for a high energy cutoff , which was found to be at 140@xmath5 kev , but with large systematic uncertainties due to ambiguities in the modeling ( bianchi et al .",

    "this paper is structured as follows : sec .",
    "2 describes the observation and data reduction ; sec .  3",
    "presents the spectral analysis , while the results are discussed in sec .",
    "ngc  5506 was observed with  ( obsid 60061323 ) on 2014  april  1 , as part of a snapshot survey of agn selected from the  all - sky survey ( e.g. baumgartner et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "the observation was coordinated with the  observatory ( obsid 00080413001 ) , which observed the same target starting just 12 hours later , on 2012  april  2 .",
    "the  and  observations are sufficiently close in time that they can be considered simultaneous as there is no evidence for spectral variability on this time scale ( see fig .",
    "the combined data therefore provide an instantaneous broadband snapshot of the x - ray spectrum of ngc  5506 in the 0.880  kev band .",
    "the total  and  exposures are 56  ks and 2.6  ks , respectively .    the  data were reduced in the standard manner described in detail in perri et al .",
    "we used heasoft  v6.15.1 , nustardas  v1.3.1 , and caldb version 20131223 . following the event filtering using the nupipeline script",
    ", we extracted the source spectrum from a circular aperture 80  in radius centered on the peak of the point source image .",
    "the background extraction region covered the free area of the same detector , excluding the @xmath6110  region around the source in order to avoid flux in the point spread function wings .",
    "the spectrum and the corresponding response files were generated using the nuproducts script .",
    "we bin the spectra for modules fpma and fpmb to a minimum of 20  counts per bin before background subtraction , and fit them simultaneously , without coadding .",
    "the cross - normalization constant is left free to vary in all our fits ( with the instrumental normalization of fpma fixed at unity ) .",
    "we used online resources provided by the asi science data center ( asdc ) for   data reduction , heasoft  v6.13 and caldb version 130313 were used for processing .",
    "the spectrum was extracted from a region with a radius of 20  centered on the brightest peak of emission , and the background was sampled from an annular region extending between 40  and 80  around the source . for spectral",
    "fitting we use the source spectrum binned to a minimum of 20  counts per bin before background subtraction .",
    "the cross - normalization constant is left free to vary in all our fits .",
    "we find it to be consistent with the expected systematic uncertainty of @xmath7% determined from cross - calibration between  and  ( madsen et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "the analysis of the _ nustar _ light curves shows the presence of flux variability of the order of 20% , but without any significant spectral variability ( fig .",
    "a hint of a hardening of the spectrum at lower fluxes is apparent , but it is easily explained by a small contribution from reflection from distant matter .",
    "therefore , we used the spectra integrated over the entire observation . in all spectral",
    "fitting we combined the _",
    "nustar _ and",
    "spectra , and included galactic absorption with a column density of 3.8@xmath810@xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "all spectral fitting was done using the public package xspec .",
    "the reader is referred to its webpage for informations on the fitting code and for details on the various spectral models applied here .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all quoted errors correspond to 90% confidence levels for one interesting parameter .",
    "first , we fitted the spectra with a simple , absorbed power law with an exponential high - energy cutoff ( cutoffpl model in xspec ) .",
    "the fit is unacceptable ( @xmath11/d.o.f.=1989/1090 ) , mostly due to a prominent iron line and curvature at high energies ( see fig .",
    "[ badfit ] ) .",
    "as both features are suggestive of reflection , we added an xillver component ( actually the xillver - a - ec2 version , which includes both the angular dependence of the emitted radiation and a primary power law with an exponential cutoffjavier / xillver/ ] ) .",
    "this results in a dramatic improvement in the quality of the fit ( @xmath11/d.o.f.=1150/1085 ) .",
    "further improvements are found by adding a mekal component ( absorbed only by galactic material ) to account for some residuals in the soft x - ray band , which are likely due to the extended emission found by _",
    "( bianchi et al . 2003 ) , and which result in @xmath11/d.o.f.=1144/1083 ; and adding fe xxv and fe xxvi narrow lines , following matt et al . (",
    "2001 ) ( @xmath11/d.o.f.=1135/1081 ) .",
    "the best fit parameters are listed in table  [ tablebestfit ] , while the spectra , best fit model and data / model ratio are shown in fig  [ bestfit ] .",
    "the various spectral components are shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] ) .",
    "the normalization of the reflection component corresponds to a standard @xmath12 parameter ( defined as the solid angle of the reflecting matter in units of 2@xmath13 ) of about 0.7 .",
    "the observed 2 - 10 kev flux is 4.87@xmath810@xmath14 erg @xmath10 s@xmath15 ; when corrected for absorption , the flux is 6.23@xmath810@xmath14 erg @xmath10 s@xmath15 corresponding to a luminosity of 5.26@xmath810@xmath16 erg s@xmath15 .",
    "this flux is at the lower end of the range of fluxes found so far for this source ( guainazzi et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "undoubtedly , the most interesting result relates to the high - energy cutoff .",
    "[ contour ] and  [ contour2 ] , which show the correlation between the high - energy cutoff vs. the power law index and the normalization of the reflection component , respectively , indicate that the cutoff is very high ( best fit value around 700 kev ) .",
    "even with this very large value , the high - energy cutoff is constrained on both its lower and upper ends at the 3@xmath2 level .",
    "this shows the amazing capability of _ nustar _ to measure this parameter ( at least for a bright source with a relatively simple spectrum like ngc5506 ) , even for energies much higher than the 79 kev upper limit to the _ nustar _ energy range . even allowing for some remaining systematic errors in the effective area , which may affect the upper bounds of the contours in figs .",
    "[ contour ] and  [ contour2 ] , and given the fact ( see below ) that the result is robust against different modelling of the continuum , we can affirm that the cutoff energy is , at the 99.97% confidence level , higher than 350 kev ( see the appendix for further details ) .",
    "the reflection component appears to be moderately ionized .",
    "indeed , forcing the reflecting matter to be neutral results in a fit which is worse at the 99.99% confidence level , according to an f - test .",
    "the measurement of the cutoff energy , however , remains basically unchanged .",
    "the iron abundance is 1.6 times higher than ( but almost consistent with ) solar , while the inclination of the reflecting surface with respect to the line of sight is found to be less than 44@xmath17 . in an obscured source , in which the inclination angle of the accretion disk and the broad line region is supposed to be high ,",
    "this may indicate that the surface of the reflecting matter ( which in the fitting model is assumed to be a slab ) is misaligned with the disk surface , as indeed expected if it has a toroidal geometry .    regarding the iron lines , we note that the flux of the neutral component ( if fitted separately from the reflection component ) is 6.87@xmath18@xmath8@xmath19 ph @xmath10 s@xmath15 , consistent with most xmm-_newton _ observations but somewhat larger than the last two ones ( guainazzi et al .",
    "the fluxes of the he- and h - like lines are also consistent with most xmm-_newton _ observations , but a bit lower in case of two observations ( guainazzi et al .",
    "they are consistent with suzaku measurements ( patrick et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "guainazzi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggested the presence of a weak , broad component of the iron line .",
    "therefore , we added an xillver - a - ec2 component blurred by relativistic effects ( kdblur model ) .",
    "the @xmath11/d.o.f.=1127/1076 tells us that this component is required only at the 82% confidence level , according to an f - test . that the reflection is mostly due to distant matter is corroborated by the fact that the flux of the neutral iron line ( when fitted separately with a narrow gaussian ) is consistent with the values found in past observations , despite the large variations in the flux of the continuum",
    "not surprisingly , given the weakness of the relativistically blurred reflection the system parameters ( among them the black hole spin ) are unconstrained , and all other parameters  including the high - energy cutoff  remain basically unchanged .",
    ".best fit parameters for the model composed by an absorbed , cutoff power law , a reflection component and ionized iron lines .",
    "see text for details . [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     finally , assuming as customary that the primary power law spectrum is due to comptonization of thermal disk photons by hot electrons in a corona , we tried to estimate the coronal parameters by substituting the cutoff power law with a comptonization model , namely comptt . for simplicity",
    ", the parameters of the reflection component , apart from the normalization , were kept frozen to the best fit values found with the cutoff power law .",
    "a slab geometry and seed photon temperature of 20 ev have been adopted .",
    "the fit is good ( @xmath11/d.o.f.=1135/1084 ) .",
    "the optical depth is found to be 0.02@xmath20 , and the coronal electron temperature 440@xmath21 kev ( consistent , within the errors , to the standard 2 - 3 factor between temperature and cutoff energy ) .",
    "similar results are obtained with a spherical geometry , apart from a larger optical depth ( about 0.09 ) , as expected ( in the spherical geometry the optical depth is the radial , thence effective , one while in the slab geometry the vertical - thence lower than effective - optical depth is used ) . using instead the compps model , a temperature of about 270 kev and an optical depth of 0.06 ( 0.14 )",
    "are found for the slab ( sphere ) geometry .",
    "we report on a joint _ nustar _ and _ swift _ observations of the bright , obscured narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  5506 . the hard x - ray spectrum is composed of an absorbed ( column density of about 3@xmath810@xmath22 @xmath10 ) power law ( with @xmath231.9 ) with an exponential high - energy cutoff , plus a moderately ionized reflection component , and ionized iron lines .",
    "the presence of relativistically blurred reflection is not required by the data .",
    "the most interesting result is the measurement of the high - energy cutoff , which demonstrates the capability of _ nustar _ to constrain this .",
    "the best fit value is 720@xmath1 kev ( 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ) . even at the 3@xmath2 level ,",
    "the cutoff value is formally bound on both sides ( see fig .  [ contour ] ) . even allowing for possible systematic errors",
    ", we can conservatively put a firm lower limit to the cutoff energy of about 350 kev at the 99.97% confidence level .",
    "this is the highest lower limit to the cutoff energy found so far in an agn by _",
    "nustar _ , and it is definitely inconsistent with values found in other agn studied by _ nustar _ , e.g. in swift  j2127.4 + 5654 ( 108@xmath2411 kev , marinucci et al .",
    "2014a ) , mcg-5 - 23 - 16 ( 116@xmath246 kev , balokovi ' c et al . 2014 ) , ic  4329a ( 186@xmath2414 kev , brenneman et al . 2014 ) , and 3c  382 ( @xmath25 kev in one of the two _ nustar _ pointings , ballantyne et al . 2014 ) other lower limits , like those found in ark  120 ( @xmath3190 kev , matt et al .",
    "2014 ) , 3c382 ( @xmath3190 kev in the other _",
    "nustar _ pointing ) and in ngc  2110 ( @xmath3210 kev , marinucci et al .",
    "2014b ) , while interesting , are nevertheless lower than the one found here in ngc  5506 .    the above results , which suggest that very high cutoff energies do exist but are not too common , are still in agreement with the predictions of x - ray background ( xrb ) synthesis models .",
    "gilli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that even a mean value of 300 kev would already saturate the xrb at 100  kev .",
    "therefore , sources like ngc  5506 should be the exception rather than the rule .    while the number of agn with a precise and robust measurement of the high - energy cutoff is still too small to search for correlations with system parameters , we can not help noting that this parameter is quite different in the two best studied narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies observed so far by _ nustar _ , namely ngc  5506 and swift  j2127.4 + 5654 ( even if we must note that ngc 5506 has x - ray properties , like e.g. the power law index and the variability pattern , more similar to broad than that to narrow lines seyfert 1s ) .",
    "the black hole mass of ngc  5506 is unfortunately very poorly known , with estimates ranging from 5@xmath810@xmath26 to 10@xmath27 solar masses ( see guainazzi et al . 2010 and references therein ) , and",
    "the eddington ratio is correspondingly uncertain , ranging from 0.007 to 0.14 ( assuming that the bolometric luminosity is 20 times the 2 - 10 kev one ) . if the low value ( indicated by the black hole mass measurement based on the central velocity dispersion ) is the correct one , the two strictest lower limits to the cutoff energy , ngc  5506 and ngc  2110 , are both found in sources with relatively low accretion rates , perhaps indicating inefficient cooling of the corona due to the low uv / soft x - ray flux",

    "as the main result of this paper is the tight lower limit to the cutoff energy , we tested the robustness of the results by making a few changes in either the data reduction or in the spectral modelling .",

    "the best fit cutoff energy varies somewhat , but remains always higher than 400 kev ( and in most cases higher than 450 - 500 kev ) at the 90% confidence level apart from the 40aperture ( and 20 counts per bin ) where the lower limit is 350 kev , very likely due to the lower number of source counts .",
    "the use of the cash statistics ( cash 1979 ) instead of @xmath11 statistics also does not significantly affect the results .    another test we made was to substitute the xillver with the reflionx ( ross & fabian 2005 ) reflection model , in a version which allows the primary emission to be a power law with an exponential cutoff .",
