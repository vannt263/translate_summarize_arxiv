    "the h  i proximity effect has been widely studied since it was discovered .",
    "one thing of particular interest is that the study of the h  i proximity effect provides a method of measuring the intensity of the muvb at the h  i edge .",
    "however , the h  i proximity effect does not reveal information on the spectral shape of the muvb .",
    "we demonstrate that the proximity effect on metal elements may provide a method for constraining the spectral shape of the muvb .",
    "songalia and cowie ( 1996 ) @xcite reported that metal elements are detected in 75% of clouds with @xmath0 .",
    "the lack of data for studying the proximity effect on metal elements is going to overcome .",
    "if future observations detect what we expect for the proximity effect on metal elements , it will confirm that the proximity effect is an ionization effect and photoionization is the dominant ionization mechanism for metal ions in which the proximity effect is seen .",
    "the electronic configurations of metal elements are complicated and a large number of ionization stages can coexist simultaneously . in general , a simple feature does not exist for metal proximity effect , unlike for the h  i proximity effect .",
    "therefore , we may study the dependence of the column density ratios of two ions in successive ionization stages on @xmath1 .",
    "we found that [ o  iv / o  iii]@xmath2 is the most optimum indicator of the spectral shape of the muvb ( we use [ x]@xmath2 to represent the ratio of the value of x in the vicinity of the qso to that in background case ) .",
    "the hst does provide the possibility to observe o  iv and o  iii simultaneously @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is clear from figure 1 that [ o  iv / o  iii]@xmath2 strongly depends on the assumed spectral shape of the muvb and less sensitive to the assumed @xmath3 ( the ionization parameter in background case ) in small @xmath1 region .",
    "therefore , [ o  iv / o  iii]@xmath2 is good for constraining the spectral shape even if @xmath3 is unknown .",
    "the ratio si  iv / c  iv , contrast to previous thought , is not a good indicator to the spectral shape , because it strongly depends on both the ionization parameter @xmath3 and the spectral shape of the muvb . a small uncertainty on either of them must results in a big error in determination of the other .",
    "we also found that the extra ionizing radiation from qsos does not always reduce the ratio c  iv / h  i , but enhances c  iv / h  i in the case of @xmath4 .",
    "so , the observed excess of c  iv systems in luminous qsos may be a photoionization effect , but not a gravitational lensing effect @xcite .",
