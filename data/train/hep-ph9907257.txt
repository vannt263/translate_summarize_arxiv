    "one of the lhc supergoals is the discovery of the supersymmetry . in particular",
    ", it is very important to investigate a possibility to discover strongly interacting superparticles ( squarks and gluino ) . in ref.@xcite ( see ,",
    "also references @xcite ) the lhc squark and gluino discovery potential has been investigated within the minimal sugra - mssm framework @xcite where all sparticle masses are determined mainly by two parameters : @xmath3 ( common squark and slepton mass at gut scale ) and @xmath4 ( common gaugino mass at gut scale ) .",
    "the signature used for the search for squarks and gluino at lhc is @xmath5 leptons + @xmath0 events .",
    "the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is that lhc is able to detect squarks and gluino with masses up to ( 2 - 2.5 ) tev .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the squark and gluino discovery potential of lhc for the case of nonuniversal gaugino masses . despite the simplicity of the sugra - mssm framework",
    "it is a very particular model .",
    "the mass formulae for sparticles in sugra - mssm model are derived under the assumption that at gut scale ( @xmath6  gev ) soft supersymmetry breaking terms are universal . however , in general , we can expect that real sparticle masses can differ in a drastic way from sparticle masses pattern of sugra - mssm model due to many reasons , see for instance refs .",
    "therefore , it is more appropriate to investigate the lhc susy discovery potential in a model - independent way .",
    "the cross section for the production of strongly interacting superparticles @xmath7 depends on gluino and squark masses . within sugra - mssm model",
    "the following approximate relations among sparticle masses take place : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 the decays of squarks and gluino depend on the relation among squark and gluino masses . for @xmath12 squarks decay mainly into gluino and quarks",

    "in our study we consider the general case when the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 is arbitrary .",
    "we investigate the detection supersymmetry using classical signature @xmath34 jets plus @xmath35 .",
    "signatures with several leptons in final state are more model dependent and besides classical signature leads to the highest discovery potential within sugra - mssm model .",
    "we find that lhc squarks and gluino discovery potential depends rather strongly on the relation between @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 masses and it decreases with the increase of the lsp mass .",

    "the main aspects of the cmsjet relevant to our study are the following .",
    "* charged particles are tracked in a 4 t magnetic field .",
    "90 percent reconstruction efficiency per charged track with @xmath44 gev within @xmath45 is assumed .    *",
    "the geometrical acceptances for @xmath46 and @xmath47 are @xmath48 and 2.5 , respectively .",
    "the lepton number is smeared according to parametrizations obtained from full geant simulations . for a 10 gev lepton",
    "the momentum resolution @xmath49 is better than one percent over the full @xmath50 coverage . for a 100 gev lepton",
    "the resolution becomes @xmath51 depending on @xmath50 .",
    "we have assumed a 90 percent triggering plus reconstruction efficiency per lepton within the geometrical acceptance of the cms detector .    *",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter of cms extends up to @xmath52 .",
    "there is a pointing crack in the ecal barrel / endcap transition region between @xmath53 ( 6 ecal crystals ) .",
    "the hadronic calorimeter covers @xmath54 .",
    "the very forward calorimeter extends from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "noise terms have been simulated with gaussian distributions and zero suppression cuts have been applied .    *",
    "@xmath56 and hadron shower development are taken into account by parametrization of the lateral and longitudinal profiles of showers .",
    "the starting point of a shower is fluctuated according to an exponential law .    * for jet reconstruction",
    "we have used a slightly modified ua1 jet finding algorithm , with a cone size of @xmath57 and 25 gev transverse energy threshold on jets .",
    "all susy processes with full particle spectrum , couplings , production cross section and decays are generated with isajet  7.32 , isasusy  @xcite .",
    "the standard model backgrounds are also generated with isajet  7.32 .",
    "the following sm processes give the main contribution to the background :    @xmath58 and qcd @xmath59 processes .",
    "as it has been mentioned above in our paper we consider only classical signature @xmath34 jets plus @xmath35 for squarks and gluino detection .",
    "we considered 3 different kinematical regions :    a. @xmath60    b. @xmath61    c. @xmath62 , @xmath12    we also considered the case when all sparticles are heavy except the third generation sfermions and lsp @xcite . for the case a squarks @xmath63 production dominates at lhc .",
    "the squark decays into quarks and lsp @xmath64 lead to the signature 2 jets plus @xmath35 . for the case",
    "b gluino pair production @xmath65 dominates .",
    "the gluino decays @xmath66 lead to @xmath67 jets plus @xmath35 signature . for the case",
    "c both squarks and gluino are produced @xmath68 at the similar rate .",
    "their decays give both 2 jets and @xmath67 jets events .",
    "we considered two types of cuts :    cuts a. @xmath34 jets with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "cuts b. @xmath67 jets with @xmath69 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "cuts a and b are appropriate for the investigation of the kinematical points a and b correspondingly , whereas for the point c both cuts a and b are useful .",
    "we have calculated sm backgrounds for different values @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 of the cut parameters .",
    "our results are presented in tables 1 - 2 .",
    ".cuts a and the corresponding value of background events for @xmath79 .",
    "[ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it follows from our results for fixed values of squark and gluino masses the visibility of signal decreases with the increase of the lsp mass .",
    "this fact has trivial explanation .",
    "indeed , in the rest frame of squark or gluino the jets spectrum becomes more soft with the increase of lsp mass .",
    "besides in parton model pair produced squarks and gluino are produced with total transverse momentum closed to zero . for high lsp masses partial cancellation of missing transverse momenta from two lsp particles takes place .",
    "the fact that with rise of lsp mass the @xmath80 spectrum becomes more soft is explicitly seen in figures 1 - 3 .    figures 4 - 6 demonstrate that within well defined cut the number of signal events decreases with increase of the lsp masses that complicates supersymmetry detection for lsp masses closed to gluino or squark masses . for the case when all sparticles are heavy except third squark generation and lsp we have found that signal is too small to be observable for all values of third generation squark masses and lsp mass . in this cass possible b - tagging will be able to suppress the background an make signal observable  .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of the calculations for squark and gluino pair production at lhc ( cms ) with their subsequent decays into jets for the case of nonuniversal gaugino masses .",
    "we have found that the visibility of signal by an excess over sm background in @xmath81 events depends rather strongly on the relation between lsp mass @xmath41 and @xmath82 masses .",
    "the visibility of the signal for fixed values of squark and gluino masses decreases with the increase of the lsp mass .",
    "for relatively heavy lsp mass closed to gluino or squark masses and for @xmath83 signal is too small to be observable .",
