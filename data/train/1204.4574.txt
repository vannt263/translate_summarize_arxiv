    "most exceptional properties of graphene are closely related to its crystalline structure and its reduced dimensionality .",
    "the combination of a honeycomb lattice and a real two dimensional material is at the origin of the linear dispersion and pseudospin symmetry of graphene low energy carriers .",
    "this gives rise to a wealth of interesting properties such massless dirac fermions  @xcite , reduced back scattering , berry phase  @xcite and weak antilocalization  @xcite .",
    "+ besides , some transport characteristics of graphene , such as high carrier mobilities  @xcite and long electronic coherence lengths  @xcite , are highly interesting from a technology point of view .",
    "graphene could also match many request of the process and design of nanoelectronic devices .",
    "indeed , because of its 2d geometry , strategies of top - down fabrication approach such as photolithography , intensively used in the mass production industry , could be more easily engineered and applied to design graphene - based nanodevices architectures .",
    "mainly for these reasons , graphene is expected to become a material of choice for future nanoelectronic .",
    "+ yet , the lack of electronic ( or transport ) gap in pristine graphene is an issue that has to be overcome for achieving standard electronic devices such as field effect transistors ( fet ) .",
    "as it has been the case for silicon , the tunning of graphene electronics is an essential step towards applications .",
    "for this reason , controlled defect engineering in @xmath0 carbon - based materials has become a topic of great excitement  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the electronic ( and transport ) properties of carbon nanotubes  @xcite and graphene - based materials  @xcite can be considerably enriched by chemical modifications , including substitution and molecular doping  @xcite as well as functionalization .",
    "another approach to tune graphene s properties is provided by ion or electron beam irradiation which introduces structural defects ( _ e.g. _  vacancies ) in @xmath0 carbon - based nanostructures . as an example , convincing room - temperature signatures of an anderson regime in @xmath4 irradiated carbon nanotubes have been reported  @xcite . in contrast , the conductivity of irradiated two - dimensional graphene saturates at the dirac point above @xmath5 even down to cryogenic temperatures  @xcite , suggesting a stronger robustness of defective graphene .",
    "nonetheless , many symmetries are broken when lattice disorder , such as structural defects , is introduced into a perfect honeycomb lattice  @xcite . accordingly",
    ", structural defects in such materials should strongly affect the transport properties .",
    "we will show that a strong ( anderson ) localization regime could be observed but , only in regions of energy corresponding to specific resonances directly associated to a certain type of defect and which not necessarily coincide with the dirac point .",
    "another reason why irradiated two - dimensional graphene seems to exhibit strong robustness compared to irradiated carbon nanotubes for an equivalent amount of structural defects , is the dimensionality .",
    "indeed , the scaling theory of localization predicts a different behavior of the localization phenomena in one and two dimensional materials  @xcite . + the paper is elaborated as follow : in section [ sec1 ]",
    ", we describe the geometry and the electronic properties of structural defects with ab initio and tight - binding techniques",
    ". then , in section [ sec2 ] , we present the real - space kubo - greenwood methodology and discuss the transport properties of large graphene planes with a realistic structural disorder . we also perform an in - depth analysis of the localization phenomena obtained within the present approach",
    ". finally , in section [ sec3 ] , we conclude on our results and discuss about the possibility to validate our theoretical predictions with experiments .",
    "structural defects exist in various forms in graphene  @xcite and more generally in @xmath0 carbon - based materials . in this paper ,",
    "three types of structural defects are considered , the stone - wales ( sw ) defect and two possible reconstructions of the divacancy .",
    "these three defects are non - magnetic , in contrast with monovacancies for instance which contain an unbounded carbon atom .",
    "consequently , the issue of induced magnetization and spin interaction between defects does not need to be taken into account .",
    "the sw defect is a well known and common defect in @xmath0 carbon - based materials  @xcite which consists in a @xmath6 degree rotation of a carbon - carbon bond .",
    "this topological transformation yields to the formation of two heptagons connected with two pentagons ( fig.[fig1].a ) .",
    "et al . _ have reported in a theoretical study  @xcite that in graphene a sw defect could produce a slight out - of - plane deformation .",
    "in this situation , the carbon bonds in the close neighboring of the sw defect are no more fully @xmath0 hybridized but become partially @xmath7-like hybridized . considering this theoretical prediction",
    "would imply that the new orbitals hybridization could induce spin - orbit coupling as it has been predicted for the case of ripples  @xcite .",
    "however , such out - of - plane deformations have never been obtained in our calculations . to ensure that the in - plane geometry was not a metastable state related to a local minimum of total energy , additional calculations",
    "have been performed with a starting geometry containing out - of - plane atoms .",
    "after structural relaxation , the out - of - plane atoms always go back to the plane .",
    "moreover , to our knowledge no experimental stm measurements have confirmed this behavior predicted in ref  @xcite .",
    "therefore , only the in - plane geometry has been considered in this article .",
    "+ vacancies are missing carbon atoms in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "they can not be considered as a reversible geometrical modification of the ideal graphene plane and thus strictly speaking , they do not belong to the class of topological defects .",
    "vacancies can be created by irradiating the graphene plane with ions such as @xmath4 for instance .",
    "single vacancies ( or monovacancies ) migrate easily in the graphene plane and are stabilized when they recombine with another one to give a divacancy defect  @xcite .",
    "two kinds of divacancy defects are explored here . in the first case , the reconstruction yields to the formation of 2 pentagons and 1 octagon ( so - called 585 , fig.[fig1].b ) , while in the second case it yields to the formation of 3 pentagons and 3 heptagons ( so - called 555 - 777 , fig.[fig1].c ) . according to our ab initio calculations the formation energy of the 555 - 777",
    "divacancy is smaller than the one of the 585 divacancy by about @xmath8ev .",
    "this stabilization of the 555 - 777 divacancy with regards to the 585 divacancy in graphene , which contrasts to the case of carbon nanotubes , is also reported by g .-",
    "et al . _",
    ". a third kind of divacancy , not studied here , has also been reported  @xcite .",
    "this third type of divacancy has a larger extension and is thus more complicated to parametrize within a tight - binding model .",
    "actually , it involves 9 carbon rings including 4 pentagons , 1 hexagon and 4 heptagons ( so - called 5555 - 6 - 7777 ) . to conclude on the geometry analysis of these defects ,",
    "one notes that the 585 divacancy as well as the sw defect possess a @xmath9 symmetry since two orthogonal symmetry axis can be defined , whereas the 555 - 777 divacancy possess a @xmath10 symmetry ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the presence of these three structural defects has already been experimentally reported in graphene by means of stm experiments  @xcite or tem images  @xcite , and their influence on the transport properties deserves in - depth inspection .          in order to study these three defects , ab",
    "initio simulations are first employed .",
    "the calculations have been performed using the siesta package  @xcite in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation functional in the ceperley - alder form  @xcite , as parametrized by perdew and zunger  @xcite .",
    "troullier - martins pseudopotentials are used to account for the core electrons  @xcite .",
    "the valence electron wave functions are expanded in a double-@xmath11 polarized basis set of finite - range numerical pseudoatomic orbitals  @xcite .",
    "+ the ab initio calculations have two objectives . on one hand , it allows to obtain the detailed geometry of the defect , and on the other hand , it allows to elaborate a tight - binding model for an isolated defect . in both cases ,",
    "a convergence study with regards to the size of the cell used in calculations needs to be performed .",
    "the supercell technique , which consists in placing the defect in a cell which is a multiple of the standard unitcell of the pristine system , is therefore employed .",
    "+ first , a structural relaxation of the supercell containing one defect is performed for different supercell sizes , i.e. @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being the conventional unitcell ) . to ensure that the defect does not interact with its repeated images ,",
    "the potential associated to the defect must tend to zero at the edges of the supercell .",
    "the @xmath15 supercells are found to be large enough for each defect to obtain such a convergence .",
    "final positions of the atoms in the vicinity of the defects are then extracted and will be used to construct the tight - binding models .",
    "the @xmath15 supercells after structural relaxation of each defect are displayed in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the sw defect does not induce strong distortions of the neighboring hexagon rings , whereas the 585 divacancy exhibits a more pronounced impact . indeed in the latter case ,",
    "a distortion of the hexagons rings along the vertical axis ( aligned with octagon ) is observed .",
    "a slight distortion is also observed for the 555 - 777 divacancy but smaller than for the 585 one .",
    "+ in fig.[fig2 ] , the electronic properties of the defects are examined through the study of their respective band structures .",
    "the electronic bands are plotted along an extended path connecting high symmetry points in the brillouin zone .",
    "the path used here ( see left panel of fig.[fig2 ] ) , which is longer than the usual k-@xmath17-m - k path used for graphene , has been carefully chosen to evidence all useful details . indeed , as the structural defects break the symmetry of the pristine graphene lattice , the hexagonal symmetry of the brillouin zone is also lifted . as a consequence , paths in the brillouin zone that were equivalent in the pristine case can become inequivalent when such a type of defect is introduced . by definition , if there are no other symmetries apart the time - reversal symmetry , half of the brillouin zone needs to be examined which implies at least @xmath18 branches ( full and dotted red lines in left panel of fig.[fig2 ] ) . here , a minimal continuous path composed of @xmath19 branches have been chosen in order to depict all important details for each defect . this extended path is labeled _ a - b - c - d - e - f _ in the left panel of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "+ then , for sake of comparison between band structures of the three defects , the fermi energy has been set to zero and the energy associated with the dirac point has been indicated by a horizontal blue dashed line .",
    "the dirac cone band crossing occurs at an energy @xmath20ev above the fermi energy in case of the 555 - 777 divacancy ( fig.[fig2].c ) , thus suggesting that this defect has a p - type doping character since the fermi energy has been shifted below the dirac point energy , whereas both energies were aligned in the pristine case .",
    "obviously , the magnitude of the shift of the fermi energy is related to the concentration of defects ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "one defect in a @xmath15 supercell corresponds to @xmath22@xmath23 or equivalently @xmath24% which is the maximum concentration that will be considered in section  [ sec2 ] for transport properties .",
    "for the 585 divacancy ( fig.[fig2].b ) , the dirac point energy is located at @xmath25ev above the fermi energy , also implying a p - type doping character although slightly weaker than for the 555 - 777 divacancy .",
    "finally the dirac point energy and the fermi energy are both aligned in case of a sw defect ( fig.[fig2].a ) which indicates a no doping effect . + as mentioned in the previous paragraph , the 555 - 777 divacancy possesses a @xmath10 symmetry which is the same symmetry group as a single dirac cone ( at k or at k@xmath26 ) .",
    "indeed , even if very close to the dirac point energy the dirac cone is isotropic , at higher energies it has been demonstrated theoretically  @xcite and by arpes measurements  @xcite that a trigonal warping emerges .",
    "this effect is a signature of the @xmath10 symmetry of a single dirac cone related to the existence of two inequivalent triangular sublattices .",
    "since the 555 - 777 divacancy has the same symmetry , the band structure of the defected system preserves the initial symmetry present in pristine graphene .",
    "therefore , the usual electronic path composed of only three branches should be sufficient .",
    "it is actually easy to see for instance that in fig.[fig2].c , paths @xmath17-k@xmath27 and @xmath17-k@xmath28 are equivalent as well as paths k@xmath28-k@xmath27 and k@xmath28-k@xmath29 . on the contrary ,",
    "the 585 divacancy and the sw defect possess a @xmath9 symmetry which breaks the symmetry of the dirac cone and as a consequence the latter is shifted . for the 585 divacancy ,",
    "the first dirac cone band crossing corresponding to k valley is shifted along the direction k@xmath30 , whereas the second dirac cone band crossing corresponding to k@xmath26 valley is shifted in the opposite direction ( k@xmath31 ) .",
    "the latter is not visible in fig.[fig2].b since the path k@xmath32-@xmath17 is not represented ( but is the symmetric of k@xmath27-@xmath17 ) . for the sw defect",
    "the shift is reversed , i.e. the first dirac cone band crossing corresponding to k valley is shifted along the direction @xmath33 ( or equivalently along k@xmath34 ) , whereas the second dirac cone band crossing corresponding to k@xmath26 valley is shifted along the opposite direction ( k@xmath35 ) . for both defects , paths",
    "@xmath17-k@xmath27 and @xmath17-k@xmath28 are now inequivalent as well as paths k@xmath28-k@xmath27 and k@xmath28-k@xmath29 .",
    "this shift of the dirac cone induced by symmetry breaking has already been reported in case of uniaxial strain  @xcite , but to our knowledge not in case of point defects . + some features of the transport properties could already be anticipated from these electronic band structures analysis .",
    "for instance , rather flat bands close to the dirac point energy are observed .",
    "these flat bands have to be related to the presence of the defect , and can be seen as resonance energies associated with electrons localized around the defect .",
    "such localized states are in general responsible of reduced transport properties . for the sw defect , a flat band is observed around @xmath36ev above the dirac point energy .",
    "a second flat band is located at @xmath37ev but is embedded in many dispersive bands . for the 585 divacancy ,",
    "two regions of flat bands are observed around @xmath38ev and @xmath39ev corresponding respectively to energies @xmath40ev and @xmath41ev below the dirac point energy .",
    "another flat band is also observed around @xmath42ev but again many other dispersive bands stands at this energy . finally , for the 555 - 777 divacancy , much more flat band regions are observed but far away from the dirac point energy .",
    "indeed , flat bands are observed around @xmath43ev , @xmath38ev and @xmath42ev which corresponds respectively to energy @xmath44ev above the dirac point energy , @xmath45ev and @xmath46ev below the dirac point energy .",
    "+    -m - k-@xmath17 for @xmath15 supercell containing , ( a ) one sw defect , ( b ) one 585 divacancy , ( c ) one 555 - 777 divacancy , and with different excess charge ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the fermi energy is set to zero . ]    finally , one concludes the analysis of band structures by investigating the case of charged systems .",
    "this is reported here as a validation of the rigid band model that will be used in the next section in order to discuss transport properties of defective graphene at different energies .",
    "in contrast with the experimental configuration where the applied gate voltage effectively fill or deplete the active part of the device with electrons , our transport model relies on the rigid shift of the fermi energy in order to describe out - of - equilibrium situations .",
    "indeed , the tight - binding and transport models presented in the next paragraphs are essentially a model of the equilibrium case and can not account for the detailed impact of the excess of charge . in fig.[fig3 ] , the validity of this rigid band approximation , which neglects these charge effects , is verified by looking at the impact of net charges on the electronic band structures .",
    "calculations have been performed for systems with excess charge of @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the elementary charge .",
    "note that , computationally , the added charges are compensated by a background jellium . for a @xmath15 supercell ,",
    "a charge of @xmath49 corresponds to an carrier density of @xmath50@xmath23 .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows that the overall band structure is not strongly modified by the added charges up to @xmath51 especially in the region @xmath52$]ev around the fermi energy . for higher energies , the approximation of rigid defect model is more questionable . also , it is interesting to note that , when the conventional path composed of @xmath53 branches ( @xmath17-k - m-@xmath17 ) in the brillouin zone is used to plot the band structure ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) , a fictitious energy gap is observed .",
    "this pinpoints the importance of the symmetry breaking of the brillouin zone and the need of such an extended path as used in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the tight - binding ( tb ) models for pristine graphene and for the three defects are derived from the previous ab initio calculations .",
    "a common way to obtain the tb parameters is to choose a set of points @xmath54 in the ab initio ( or experimental ) band structure and then to use them as constraints in a fit procedure ( based on gene algorithm for instance ) .",
    "the tb parameters are adjusted by the fit to reproduce the full band structure as well as possible . here , a different strategy is applied .",
    "since the siesta hamiltonian is expressed in a localized orbitals basis set , the tb parameters can be directly _ extracted _ by performing successive operations on this siesta hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , the basis set has to be reduced to a single @xmath55 orbitals orthogonal basis .",
    "the details of the technique will be presented in a separated paper  @xcite .",
    "+ most tb studies use a @xmath56 nearest neighbors @xmath57-@xmath58 tb model to describe graphene electronic properties .",
    "however , in the present work , a two centers @xmath59 nearest neighbors @xmath57-@xmath58 orthogonal tb model has been chosen .",
    "indeed , already for pristine graphene , a @xmath59 nearest neighbors @xmath57-@xmath58 model gives much more reasonable results since it allows in particular to recover the existing asymmetry between valence ( @xmath57 ) and conduction ( @xmath58 ) bands .",
    "in contrast , a @xmath56 nearest neighbors @xmath57-@xmath58 model produces a totally symmetric band structure as shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the comparison between the ab initio and the @xmath59 nearest neighbors model band structures and total densities of states ( dos ) is very satisfactory .",
    "however , the k - m branch in the conduction band side remains not exactly reproduced by this @xmath59 nearest neighbors model .",
    "the tb parameters of this model are composed of a single on - site term @xmath60 and three hopping terms @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 corresponding respectively to @xmath56,@xmath64 and @xmath59 nearest neighbors .",
    "the pristine graphene hamiltonian then reads as @xmath65 with @xmath66ev and @xmath67ev , @xmath68ev , @xmath69ev .",

    "the ab initio and the tb band structures have been compared for a @xmath15 supercell containing one defect . in fig.[fig5 ] , the tb band structure ( black dotted lines ) is superimposed with the ab initio band structure ( red full lines ) already reported in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "a good agreement is obtained especially for the valence bands .",
    "the conduction band side seems to be less accurate but this is uniquely due to the inability of pristine graphene tb model to reproduce conduction band along k - m branch , as already illustrated in fig.[fig4 ] . as a consequence , some of the conduction bands",

    "in this section , the transport properties of large defective graphene planes is investigated . although the electronic structure study performed in the prior section already allows to draw some preliminary conclusions on the impact of structural defects on transport , the randomness character of a realistic disorder at the mesoscopic scale has to be taken into account .",

    "it is important to pay attention to the various possible orientations of the defects . as explained previously ,",
    "the structural defects possess specific symmetry groups smaller than the one of the honeycomb lattice .",

    "is also studied in order to be as close as possible to the experimental situation . in a previous paper , the case of graphene planes containing only one type of defect but with different densities has been investigated  @xcite . for a mixture of several types of defects ,",

    "it is instructive to examine the density of states of randomly disordered graphene planes .",

    ", the dos of these much larger graphene planes with randomly distributed defects reveal the salient features that persist after taking into account the randomness character of the disorder . in fig.[fig7 ] , the total dos of large graphene planes containing @xmath74% of sw , 585 and 555 - 777 divacancies , computed using the recursion method  @xcite , is compared with the total dos previously obtained for a @xmath15 supercell containing one defect ( @xmath75% ) .",
    "a first observation is that the dos of random disordered systems is much smoother than the one corresponding to a supercell@xcite . in the random case ,",
    "most of the peaks have disappeared except the ones close to the dirac point ( in fig.[fig7 ] , the dirac point has been set to zero . ) .",
    "the broadening due to the distribution disorder is more efficient in energy regions containing a lot of bands .",
    "close to the dirac point , the quantity of bands is less dense preserving the defect - induced resonances .",
    "secondly , the position of resonance energy peaks corroborate the previous analysis carried out on supercell band structures . the presence of such resonant states induced by local defects is a well known issue  @xcite .",
    "the dos of randomly disordered graphene confirm that the electron transport in an energy region around @xmath76 ev is expected to be degraded for sw defects , whereas hole transport should be altered around @xmath77 ev for 585 divacancies , and finally that 555 - 777 divacancies exhibit several resonance energies around @xmath78 ev which should also lead to reduced transport performances .",
    "+ the case of a mixture of defects is now explored by considering graphene planes containing , half sw half 585 divacancy ( sw/585 ) , then half sw half 555 - 777 divacancy ( sw/555 - 777 ) , and finally half 585 half 555 - 777 divacancies ( 585/555 - 777 ) .",

    "these dos of graphene planes containing a mixture of two types of defects are compared also with the dos of graphene planes containing a single type of defect separately ( i.e. @xmath79% ) .",
    "it is obvious that the features observed in the dos of the mixed systems are roughly the sum of the individual features of each defect type .",
    "the particular case of sw/585 is interesting in the sense that the resonance peaks of these two defects are almost symmetric with respect to the dirac point .",
    "moreover , since the resonance peaks are relatively close to the initial dirac point , they tend to overlap at this special point and yield to an increase of the dos at the dirac point . in this special situation ,",

    "the value of conductivity is minimal at those energies , which indicates that a minimal conductivity can be obtained for an energy different to the dirac point .",

    ", even the localization lengths have been extracted from semiclassical quantities using the scaling theory of localization ( eq.[ksikubo ] ) .",
    "the reason why the kubo - greenwood formalism is usually restricted to the diffusive regime , is because this is a _",
    "formalism in the sense that the framework is devoted to the description of the intrinsic properties of a material .",
    "for instance , within the kubo - greenwood formalism , the calculated semiclassical conductivity is an intensive quantity contrarily to the conductance which is extensive and depends on the system geometry .",
    "hence , the kubo - greenwood conductivity formula is usually employed in its thermodynamic limit @xmath148 ( eqs.[eqsigmakubot0k]-[eqsigmakubot0kbis ] ) .",
    "this infinite time limit imposes to restrict the analysis of @xmath108 to its asymptotic value which can be either a constant ( purely diffusive regime , @xmath149 ) or zero ( completely localized regime , @xmath150 ) . on the contrary ,",

    ", the presence of leads introduces a finite length @xmath152 of the system which allows scaling analysis describing therefore all intermediate regimes . even if there is _ a priori _ no clear definition of length in the kubo - greenwood approach since the system is periodic ( bulk ) , the present real - space implementation of this transport formalism provides a complete description of the dynamics of propagation , going from the ballistic regime at very short time simulations to quasi - diffusive and diffusive regimes as well as the weak and strong localization regimes at longer time .",
    "in fact , in these real - space simulations , the computed spreading of wave packets can be seen as an average time - dependent distance probed by the propagating charge carriers . to allow a scaling analysis within the real - space kubo - greenwood approach , the introduction of a characteristic length scale @xmath153 defined as the diameter of a fictitious circle formed by the spreading of wave packets is therefore proposed .",

    "it is more efficient to use the definition @xmath113 .",

    ", since @xmath108 is no more a constant , the general definition @xmath155 should be used . however , although using @xmath113 is in principle incorrect in the localization regime , it is nevertheless interesting to compare the two definitions . in fig.[fig15 ] , the diffusivity coefficient is plotted using either @xmath113 ( solid lines ) or @xmath155 ( dashed lines ) . for sake of comparison ,",
    "both definitions are normalized with the same value of maximum of diffusivity ( @xmath117 ) found for @xmath113 . for an energy",
    "far from the resonance energies , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath157 for which no localization effects are observed , the two curves ( solid and dashed lines ) are almost superimposed .",
    "both evaluations of @xmath108 at long time , deep in the diffusive regime , gives thus the same constant value .",
    "the only difference is a bump obtained for the diffusivity evaluated with the numerical derivative .",
    "this bump appears at the transition between the ballistic and the diffusive regime .",
    "the bump is followed by a small decrease of @xmath108 before the saturation is obtained . in principle",
    ", there is no reason to observe a decreasing of @xmath108 in a purely diffusive regime as shown in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "this bump is thus just an artifact produced by small numerical errors in @xmath158 then enhanced by its first derivative calculation  @xcite . in the localization regime , which is clearly predicted for energies @xmath159ev , fig.[fig15 ] shows that the diffusivity computed with @xmath113 overestimates the one derived with @xmath155 .",
    "nevertheless , the overestimation in the localization regime being almost constant with increasing time , the general behavior is still correct when @xmath108 is evaluated with @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , the curves obtained with that definition are much smoother",
    ". the definition @xmath113 could therefore be conserved even in the localization regime , keeping in mind that it slightly overestimates the true value .",

    "the horizontal dotted line denotes @xmath2 . as for the diffusivity ( fig.[fig15 ] ) both definitions of @xmath108 lead to similar conductivity curves but the use of @xmath113 produces smoother curves and a slight overestimation in the localization regime .",

    "+ in the review of lee and ramakrishnan  @xcite , the equation of weak localization correction in the scaling theory is derived using the mean free path as the characteristic length scale of the diffusive regime . according to this definition , when the length @xmath152 is equal to the mean free path @xmath147 , the conductivity is maximal and corresponds to the semiclassical conductivity ( @xmath171 ) , and for @xmath172 weak localization develops .",
    "in contrast , using eq.[eqlengthkubo ] , the obtained semiclassical conductivity ( or @xmath170 ) occurs at a length scale different from @xmath147 .",
    "for instance in fig.[fig17 ] , for an energy @xmath173ev ( @xmath174 ) , the maximum of conductivity occurs at @xmath175 nm , which is about ten times greater than the mean free path computed at this energy ( @xmath176 nm ) .",
    "therefore , the definition of length eq.[eqlengthkubo ] might be questioned and argued to be misleading .",
    "but , considering the scaling in time for which there is no ambiguity , there is also a factor of ten between the calculated mean scattering time @xmath177 and the time @xmath112 for which the diffusivity coefficient reaches its maximum value .",
    "actually , in a semiclassical picture , this is consistent with the fact that to reach completely the diffusive regime ( saturation of @xmath108 ) , the charge carriers needs to encounter several scattering events which corresponds thus to a total traveling distance of a few times the mean free path .",
    "the same idea also explains that the charge carriers need several scattering events before the weak localization corrections start to present a clear effect .",
    "indeed , these corrections are due to constructive interferences between forward and backward scattering paths which form loop trajectories .",
    "the shortest loop trajectory is at least two times the mean free path in a semiclassical picture .",
    "the introduction of an additional length scale @xmath168 is therefore meaningful for the interpretation of such quantum corrections . in fig.[fig17 ] , it is obvious that the conductivity decay follows the logarithmic behavior predicted by eq.[eqscalinglaw ] .",
    "however , using the mean free path as a characteristic length scale in the formula does not allow to fit @xmath163 .",
    "on the contrary , eq.[eqscalinglaw2 ] allows to more correctly predict the scaling of the conductivity and therefore to extrapolate to lengths @xmath152 longer than the ones computed . as a consequence",
    ", the localization length @xmath143 can be extracted with a better precision by replacing the mean free path @xmath147 by the diffusion length @xmath168 .",
    "indeed , @xmath143 can be evaluated as the length @xmath152 for which the conductivity is equal to zero or equivalently for which the weak localization corrections are equal to the semiclassical conductivity .",
    "@xmath178    compared to eq.[ksikubo ] , the localization lengths calculated using eq.[ksikubo2 ] are roughly ten times greater for weak localization regime and about @xmath179-@xmath180 times greater for stronger localization regime .",
    "for instance , in fig.[fig17 ] for an energy @xmath181ev which corresponds exactly to the resonance of 585 divacancy and for which the localization effects are stronger , @xmath182 nm obtained with eq.[ksikubo ] and @xmath183 nm estimated with eq.[ksikubo2 ] .",
    "note however that in case of strong localization effects such as @xmath181ev in fig.[fig17 ] and for higher defect densities such as @xmath73% ( not shown here ) , there is a deviance between the logarithmic decay predicted by scaling theory for the weak localization corrections and the actual computed quantum conductivities .",
    "as already reported recently in  @xcite , in such strong localization case , the weak localization corrections are no more suitable and an exponential decay has to be used to describe the scaling of @xmath163 which results in long tail corresponding to evanescent mode . finally , in very strong localization regime , the localization length could alternatively be evaluated from the long time saturation of the quadratic spreading  @xcite as @xmath184 unfortunately , in our simulations , a complete saturation of the quadratic",
    "spreading has never been observed for the total elapsed time computed .",
    "in conclusion , the electronic and transport properties of graphene planes containing structural defects such as , sw , 585 and 555 - 777 divacancies , has been investigated theoretically .",
    "first , _ ab initio _ techniques have been used to study the geometry and the electronic band structures of single defects in a supercell . from these results , relaxed atomic positions and electronic defect potentials",
    "have been employed to build accurate tb models for each individual structural defects .",
    "comparisons between _ ab initio _ and tb band structures and dos have shown a good agreement .",
    "the elaborated tb models have then been employed to compute dos of large graphene planes containing randomly distributed structural defects of various natures and concentrations .",
    "the comparison of these dos with the dos obtained for supercell have put in evidence the smoothening effect of the randomness character in distribution and orientation of defect at a mesoscopic scale .",
    "then , the computed dos of graphene planes including a mixture of defects have illustrated that defect - induced resonant peaks can be assigned to individual defect separately demonstrating that those resonances constitute a fingerprint of each structural defect .",
    "afterwards , using a kubo - greenwood method , the transport properties have been examined .",
    "the computed semiclassical transport quantities , such as mean free path , mobility , and conductivity have exhibited systematic degradations around resonant defect energies .",
    "in particular , it has been predicted that a minimum conductivity ( @xmath185 ) can be obtained at an energy different than dirac point , and that plateau of minimum conductivity are formed when increasing the defect density .",
    "finally , a detailed analysis of the diffusivity deep into the localization regime has allowed to extend the use of the kubo - greenwood method to predict length dependence of the quantum conductivity ( @xmath163 ) . the latter exhibits a logarithmic decay with increasing lengths around defect resonance energies due to localization phenomena as expected by the scaling theory .",
    "an anderson insulating behaviour is thus anticipated for graphene with @xmath3 of structural defect and associated localization lengths are expected to be in the order of a few tens nanometers .",
    "however , localization effects are not observed in all the spectrum but only around defect resonant energies complicating therefore its experimental observation .",
    "transport measurements would thus require an efficient electrostatic gate to probe larger part of the spectrum and to align fermi energy with these defect resonant energies .",
    "additionally , transport characterization with different sizes of graphene samples exposed to the same amount of structural defects could be conducted in order to perform scaling analysis of the conductivity .",
    "alternatively , magneto - transport experiments on a fixed size sample could also reveal localization phenomena induced by structural defects as well as low temperature transport measurements which should evidence a variable range hopping behaviour .",
