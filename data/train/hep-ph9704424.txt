    "the accurate determination of the mass of the w boson is expected to be one of the most important standard physics results to be obtained from lep2 measurements .",
    "since @xmath3  is one of the key parameters of the electroweak theory , precise knowledge of the w mass allows one to test the standard model ( sm ) , and together with the top quark mass can be used to constrain the allowed range of the higgs boson mass in the sm , or restrict the parameter space of other `` new physics '' .",
    "the present value of @xmath3  is based on the direct measurements in @xmath4 interactions at cern @xcite and at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the combined result from these studies is @xmath3  = @xmath5  gev @xcite .",
    "data from lep2 recorded in 1996 at 161 and 172 gev are expected to lead already to a comparable error when they are fully analysed and the results of the four lep experiments are combined . when all existing data from the cdf and d0 experiments ( more than 100  pb@xmath6 per experiment ) are analyzed , it is envisaged that the error on the w mass will be reduced to about 70  mev . on the other hand , an indirect determination of @xmath3  from a sm fit using lep and slc measurements give an error in the w mass of approximately 40  mev ( for a higgs mass of 300  gev ) @xcite , thus setting the scale for a significant new test of the model .",
    "three different methods have been proposed for the determination of the w mass in @xmath0  annihilation at lep2 @xcite :    * the threshold cross - section measurement of the process @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath2  .",
    "it has been shown that maximum sensitivity to @xmath3  is achieved for the energy @xmath7  gev .",
    "now these measurements are complete and the error in the w mass is about 450  mev for a single experiment @xcite , with a combined result @xmath8 gev @xcite . * the measurement of the charged lepton end - point energy .",
    "this gives an estimated error exceeding 300  mev @xcite for the total integrated luminosity expected at lep2 and is therefore not competitive with the other two methods .",
    "* the direct reconstruction of the @xmath3  from the final state particles .",
    "this is considered to be the most promising method .",
    "it relies on the use of the four constraints from the energy- momentum conservation",
    ". an additional constraint can be added by the assumption that the two w bosons have equal masses .",
    "two decay channels  @xmath9 ( four jets ) and @xmath10 ( two jets plus leptons )  can be used in this analysis .",
    "the estimated total error for the two channels combined is 34  mev , assuming four experiments each collecting 500  @xmath11 data at @xmath12  gev @xcite .    for the process @xmath0@xmath1 @xmath2 at lep2 energies ,",
    "the typical separation of the two decay vertices of ws in space and time is of order of 0.1  fm , much smaller than the hadronization scale ( @xmath13  fm ) .",
    "thus , when both ws decay hadronically , the hadronization regions of the w@xmath14 and w@xmath15 overlap , and colour interconnection @xcite during the hadronization as well as bose - einstein ( be ) correlations @xcite between identical bosons among the decay products of the two ws can couple the two systems and thereby affect the w mass measurement .    at present",
    "it is not excluded that these effects could each contribute about 100  mev to the theoretical uncertainty , which would make the four jet channel essentially useless for the w mass measurement .",
    "hence , apart from the intrinsic interest in these phenomena the studies of colour interconnection and bose - einstein correlations are very important , and reliable estimates of the size of their effect on the reconstructed w mass are highly desirable in order to evaluate their contributions to the systematic error in this measurement .    the first attempt to investigate the influence of bose - einstein correlations in the determination of w mass",
    "was made in @xcite , where the luboei algorithm , implemented in the jetset monte - carlo program @xcite , was used .",
    "the basic assumptions of this approach are that be effects are local in phase space and do not alter such characteristics as the event multiplicity or the cross section .",
    "the momenta of the bosons produced at the hadronization stage are shifted by amounts calculated to reproduce the two particle correlation function expected for a source with a gaussian space - time distribution .",
    "this procedure , however , does not preserve momentum and energy simultaneously .",
    "the violation is not large , however , and energy conservation is restored in an ad hoc way by rescaling all particle momenta with a common factor .",
    "the latter procedure introduces an artificial shift in the w mass , even if there are no bose - einstein correlations between the particles coming from different ws .",
    "the procedure also tends to make the jets more narrow , thereby decreasing the individual jet masses . assuming a source radius of 0.5 fm , the corrected mass shift was found to be 95  mev at @xmath16  gev @xcite .",
    "the shift increases with increasing energy and decreasing source radius .    in the following analysis",
    "we will address the problem of bose - einstein correlations , but using another approach , which is based on assigning weights to the simulated events according to the momentum distributions of final state bosons . in the global event weight scheme a shift in the w mass can arise , if the event weight depends on @xmath3 .",
    "the use of such global event weights is not straightforward and was discarded in the above study on fairly general grounds .",
    "our aim is to reinvestigate the suitability of the method and to estimate approximately the systematic error on the w mass from bose - einstein correlations .",
    "the use of global event weights is complementary to the local reweighting scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite in the sense that here the kinematical properties of the events are preserved , while all probabilities and multiplicities may change .",
    "we have not found a unique solution to the problem of assigning the weights , however , and have used a number of different weighting schemes to assess the range of effects that can be expected from bose - einstein correlations .",
    "we have used the pythia event generator @xcite to generate monte carlo samples of @xmath0  @xmath17 @xmath2  @xmath17 4  jet events .",
    "a basic assumption here is that hadronic w and z@xmath18 boson decays are sufficiently similar , so that by using the tuning of the monte - carlo model parameters that reproduces the experimental data from z@xmath18 decays at lep , bose - einstein effects in single w decays are already effectively taken into account in properties such as multiplicities and single particle momentum spectra .",
    "hence , only the correlation between identical particles from different ws have been included in the weight calculation . in order to check the self - consistency and inherent systematic errors of the method",
    "we have applied the same weighting method to the well studied process of z@xmath18 hadronic decays .    since we want to estimate the maximal systematic error on the measured w mass due to the mass shift arising from bose - einstein correlations , we have not taken into account smearing due to experimental resolution and acceptance , reconstruction method etc .",
    "various possibilities of constructing event weights are discussed in the following section .",
    "some consequences of these weighting schemes on certain measurable quantities at the z@xmath18 peak are considered in section 3 , together with possible constraints on be effects from z@xmath18 physics . in section 4",
    "the influence of be effects on the process of w pair production at lep2 is analyzed .",
    "the bose - einstein effect corresponds to an enhancement in the production probability of identical bosons to be emitted with small relative momenta , as compared to non - identical particles under otherwise similar conditions .",
    "experimental data are usually analysed in terms of the correlation function defined as the ratio of the two - particle probability density to the product of the corresponding single particle quantities :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the four - momentum of particle @xmath21 . assuming a spherical space - time distribution of the particle source",
    ", the correlation function takes the form :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the four - momentum difference , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is equal to the absolute square of the fourier transform of the particle emitting source density , with the normalization condition @xmath26 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 , known as the incoherence parameter , takes into account the fact that for various reasons , the strength of the correlations can be reduced",
    ".    often a gaussian model is assumed for the source density , which leads to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the radius parameter .",
    "experimentally , this gives a reasonable description of bose - einstein correlations in many types of collisions . in @xmath0",
    "collisions typical values of @xmath29 and @xmath27 are respectively 0.5 fm and 0.3 ( 1.0 for directly produced pions ) @xcite .    in order to simulate the effects of bose - einstein correlations , we have in this study chosen to use the event weighting method .",
    "the method arises very naturally in a quantum mechanical approach , where the weight can be constructed as the ratio of the square of the symmetrized multiparticle amplitude to the square of the non - symmetrized amplitude corresponding to the emission of distinguishable particles .",
    "the use of global event weights leads to a number of conceptual and computational difficulties , however , which must be overcome for any quantitative conclusions to be drawn and which we will attempt to address below .",
    "there are several possibilities to construct event weights .",
    "one way of forming the weight is to take a product of enhancements @xmath30 for all pairs of identical bosons in the event @xcite :    @xmath31    for high multiplicity events this weight can become extremely large , so that a few such events dominate the weighted distributions and lead to non - realistic distributions .",
    "the event weights therefore have to be regularized in some way . in order to keep the statistical error at a reasonably low level ,",
    "we have chosen to discard events with very high weights ( higher than some @xmath32 ) .",
    "this , however , has the unpleasant effect of making the results @xmath32-dependent .",
    "we have tried to circumvent this difficulty by analyzing the @xmath32 dependence and extrapolating the results to @xmath33 .",
    "one can also rescale the weight of the event using a single constant @xmath34 :    @xmath35    where @xmath34 is a constant slightly larger than 1 , and @xmath36 is the number of pairs in the event ( i.e. the number of terms in the product in ( [ v1 ] ) ) .",
    "the value of @xmath34 is chosen to keep the average multiplicity reasonably close to its value before event weighting @xcite . for a constant @xmath32 ,",
    "we have found , however , that the method gives rise to numerical difficulties , stemming from the fact that increasing @xmath34 brings in more events from the high weight tail of @xmath37 , which leads to large fluctuations in the multiplicity and the average event weight .",
    "our results for the shifts in multiplicity and @xmath3  using @xmath38 are roughly consistent with those found using @xmath37 , and @xmath38 will not be discussed further .",
    "( 100,100)(0,0 )    a problem with these weighting methods is that , like the local reweighting scheme of ref @xcite , they emphasize narrow jets and thereby introduce artificial correlations also between non - identical particles . in order to counteract this",
    ", one can use the weight calculated with non - identical pairs to rescale ( [ v1 ] ) :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the weight calculated according to ( [ v1 ] ) but for non - identical bosons in the same event , while @xmath36 and @xmath41 are the numbers of identical and non - identical pairs , respectively .",
    "this also leads to a better numerical behaviour , as illustrated in fig .  1 , which shows the distributions of @xmath37 and @xmath42 for simulated ww events at @xmath12 gev .",
    "the high weight tail is much less pronounced for @xmath42 than for @xmath37 .",
    "both fall off to a good approximation as inverse powers , with exponents @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , which makes it plausible that the sum of all weights converges .    a different method of constructing the event weight , which is closer to a full quantum mechanical treatment , starts from the introduction of a symmetric amplitude , which has @xmath45 terms @xcite .",
    "this leads to a weight :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the number of times when the first and second indices differ . for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath36 identical particles ,",
    "equation ( [ v1 ] ) gives a weight of @xmath50 , while eq .",
    "( [ v4 ] ) results in the correct value @xmath45 .",
    "however , for typical hadronic configurations this difference is much smaller , and ( [ v4 ] ) is rarely used because of computational difficulties .",
    "we had to restrict ourselves to events containing no more than 8 identical particles of each kind .",
    "this limitation is too restrictive already at z@xmath18 energies , where the number of identical boson combinations is lower than in @xmath2  events , and rejected about 50 % of events in w pair production , making it effectively useless for the latter case .",
    "we used it only to check that it gave essentially consistent results with our other methods for events with low multiplicity .",
    "the event weights defined above were based on the gaussian parametrization of the particle emitting source .",
    "this implies that @xmath51 for all values of @xmath23 .",
    "this is not true in all models , however .",
    "in addition to the above weights , we have therefore also studied a different pair weight , inspired by the weight used in @xcite , where @xmath25 in ( [ c1 ] ) is not required to be always positive :    @xmath52    for @xmath53 close to 1 , this is very close to ( [ gauss ] ) apart from becoming slightly negative at large @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding weight @xmath54 is built in analogy with ( [ v1 ] ) , but with the gaussian ( [ gauss ] ) replaced by ( [ wb ] ) ( the dotted line in figure 1 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath55 leads to a good overall description . due to the better numerical behaviour of this weight function (",
    "the exponent in the power fit is @xmath56 ) , we were able to apply @xmath54 without further rescaling .",
    "various measurable properties of the z@xmath18 will be affected to different extent , if one introduces event weights into the simulation of its hadronic decays .",
    "since the partonic states before hadronization are known to be well described by perturbative calculations , which do not take into account bose - einstein correlations , uncritical application of event weights may lead to large inconsistencies with e.g. measured branching ratios and relative frequencies of jet multiplicities etc . in order to see how serious these effects are and to judge what consequences",
    "this has for the analysis of the ww events , the precise experimental data from z@xmath18 decays can be used to check the event weighting schemes of bose - einstein correlations for w pair production at lep2 .",
    "we have simulated @xmath57 hadronic events at @xmath58 and @xmath59  gev .",
    "table 1 presents the differences for charged particle multiplicity , shift of z@xmath18 peak position in hadronic vs leptonic decay modes , branching fractions for charm and beauty decays ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) and the ratio of three to two jet events with and without event weighting .    .",
    "differences in charged multiplicity , peak mass of z@xmath18 , branching fractions and three - to - two jet event ratio , between weighted and non - weighted events , for various weighting systems described in the text . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      * there is a clear correlation between the be - induced shifts in the w mass and in the charged particle multiplicity in ww production : the larger is the increase in charged multiplicity , the larger mass shifts are expected . *",
    "both @xmath42 and @xmath54 weights result in fairly small shifts , while still maintaining a good reproduction of the correlation function .",
    "they are well - behaved numerically and in our opinion give quite reliable estimates of the effect .",
    "however , we conservatively take the spread of values using all three weighting schemes as indicative of the systematic errors inherent in our approach . * the fitted value for the w mass is less sensitive to be effects than the mean over the full distribution , which has been used to estimate the effect in previous investigations @xcite .",
    "our estimated values for the shift in the fitted mass are less than 20 mev , implying that be correlations are not too dangerous for the w mass measurements at the expected level of accuracy at lep2 . for the shifts in the mean w mass ,",
    "we confirm the conclusions of @xcite and find values of the same general magnitude of a few tens of mev , under similar conditions as investigated there . in all cases",
    "the shift is towards larger masses , as expected on general grounds @xcite .",
    "* for all weighting schemes , the shift in @xmath3  increases with energy in the energy range considered , but the increase is fairly small .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results to the predictions based on the implementation of bose - einstein effects by shifting the momenta of final state particles @xcite .",
    "there are several differences in the predictions of these two schemes .",
    "the most important difference is in the particle multiplicity : our approach naturally leads to an increase of the average number of particles due to bose - einstein correlations , while the momentum - shifting method assumes that the multiplicity is unchanged .",
    "experimentally , it is not known yet to what extent bose - einstein correlations might modify the particle multiplicities at high energies .",
    "the energy dependence of w mass shift is different .",
    "the strong energy dependence in momentum - shifting scheme is a combination of two effects : the increase of the systematic shift for low momentum particles in the direction of smaller w momenta , and the differences in momentum spectra of w decay products for various energies , as stressed in @xcite .",
    "this seems to be less pronounced in the present approach .",
    "the present study confirms that the systematic effect of be correlations on the w mass determination can potentially be quite large , as found in @xcite , although the actual values of the mass shift found here are somewhat smaller .",
    "the size of the shift is however quite sensitive to the procedure used to extract the value of the w mass .",
    "in particular we observe that a fit to the lineshape of the w mass distribution has a much smaller systematic error from bose - einstein correlations than the average mass , due to the fact that the main effect on @xmath3  in our scheme arises from the tails of the mass distribution , which contain very little information about the peak position .",
    "hence it does seem possible to keep the systematic error from this source below about 20 mev .",
    "careful work linked to the actual fitting procedures used by the lep experiments is obviously needed in order to assess this in the individual cases and to optimize the analysis procedures . since the value of the mass shift is always positive ( as also expected on general grounds ) , a further reduction of the systematic error by a factor two is in principle possible by assigning the expected shift as a correction to @xmath3 .    the estimates in this paper were all made assuming full bose - einstein correlation strength ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "if this should turn out not to be the case experimentally ( see @xcite ) , the effect on the w mass may be correspondingly reduced .",
    "here we just want to bring attention to the fact , that such a reduction can not a priori be expected to depend proportionally on @xmath27 , as it is presumably not the correlation strength , but the absolute number of correlated pairs of pions in the enhanced region of the @xmath23 distribution that is important for the size of the possible shift in the w mass .",
    "the comparison of hadronic decays of @xmath63 and @xmath64 channels gives a unique possibility to investigate the influence of bose - einstein correlations on various properties of final state particles , such as multiplicity , transverse and longitudinal momentum spectra , resonance properties and reconstructed jet characteristics .",
    "it is possible , that by taking proper care in the fitting procedures used , one may at the same time be able to use a large part of the hadronic @xmath2  events for the w mass determination , and to study the interconnection effects in the relatively clean setting of @xmath0  @xmath17 ww events , by restricting the study to the region of large , off - peak w masses where these effects are expected to be the largest .",

    "* results of a similar study have been published recently @xcite .",
    "the weight system used in @xcite is a simplified version of our @xmath65 , where the computational difficulties were avoided by averaging over `` clusters '' of particles .",
    "the authors do not see any mass shift due to be correlations at the level of their statistical precision .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the present calculation , as they have chosen to use @xmath66  fm , which strongly reduces the number of interfering pairs .",
