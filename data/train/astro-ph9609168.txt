    "the environment at the centers of galaxy cluster cooling flows is exotic and extreme compared to that found near the average galaxy in the universe . the intracluster medium ( icm )",
    "thermal pressure is a factor of 10 - 100 times higher than that near other cluster galaxies .",
    "the cooling flow may deposit @xmath0100 m@xmath1/yr onto the central galaxy in such clusters .",
    "thus , this gaseous environment may be a particularly good one to trigger radio source production , confine the extended radio plasma , and shape the extended radio emission if asymmetries ( i.e. , pressure gradients ) exist in the flow . with such a potentially strong relationship between the environment and the radio source ,",
    "radio emission associated with central dominant galaxies may be a useful , generally unappreciated probe of cooling flows .    in @xmath22 of this paper , we begin by presenting a brief overview of cluster radio sources so that radio galaxies in cooling flows can be placed into a broader relational context . next , in @xmath23 , the radio continuum properties of supergiant cds which lie at the centers of clusters are described . in @xmath24 , we discuss the apparent strong relationship between radio structure and the cooling flow environment by comparing vla and new _ rosat _ hri images .",
    "then , in @xmath25 , numerical simulations of supersonic radio jets in a cooling flow atmosphere are presented in an effort to gain insight into the radio / x - ray relationships . in @xmath26 , we briefly discuss clusters without cooling flows and present new hydro / n - body simulations which show how cluster - cluster mergers can destroy cooling flows . finally , in @xmath27 , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "much of what follows in this section has been taken from a series of 7 papers which have now been published on the results of the vla 20-cm survey of @xmath3 abell clusters ( see e.g. , ledlow & owen 1995a , b,1996 ; owen & ledlow 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "cluster radio source morphologies are predominately fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) class i ( i.e. , low power , edge darkened ) .",
    "examples include narrow - angle tailed ( nat ) u - shaped sources such as ngc 1265 in perseus , wide - angle tailed ( wat ) sources such as 3c 465 in a2634 , and twin - jet sources such as 3c31 ( see owen & ledlow 1997 for many examples ) . in general ,",
    "cluster radio source structures are very complex and probably reflect the local  weather conditions \" within the icm ( burns 1996 ) .",
    "it should be noted that fanaroff - riley ii sources ( i.e. , high power , edge - brightened , classical doubles ) are rare in nearby rich clusters , but do occur @xmath47% of the time in a statistical sample of radio galaxies in abell clusters ( ledlow & owen 1996 ) .",
    "another intriguing , and poorly understood , property of cluster radio sources is the fact that the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) is virtually identical for sources inside and outside of rich clusters ( fanti 1984 ; ledlow & owen 1996 ) .",
    "this is very surprising since the higher thermal gas pressure inside rich clusters is expected to better confine extended radio sources ( and reduce adiabatic expansion losses ) and enhance source b - fields , thus creating more luminous radio sources than in radio galaxies outside rich clusters .",
    "however , this picture is clearly too simple .",
    "the probability of a cluster galaxy being a radio source was found to be independent of the global cluster galaxy density ( ledlow & owen 1995a ) .",
    "this , too , seems contrary to the conventional wisdom where ( for , at least , the more powerful radio galaxies ) the richness of the galaxy neighborhood was thought to be important in triggering radio emission in galaxies ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1986 ) .    in an effort to gain some understanding of the complex relationship between extended radio sources and their gaseous environs ,",
    "we have compared the radio structures with x - ray images of the icm from _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ for samples of abell clusters .",
    "the initial results are intriguing .",
    "we found that larger radio sources in abell clusters often coincide with clumps of x - ray emission ( burns et al .",
    "1994 ; burns 1996 ) or appear in clusters with significant substructure .",
    "for example , for a sample of 17 clusters with 26 nats , 88% have significant x - ray substructure whereas only 23% of a comparable sample of radio - quiet abell clusters have substructure ( bliton et al .",
    "we also investigated the x - ray emission around a complete sample of 25 @xmath5 radio galaxies not cataloged to be in rich clusters ; we found that 90% have x - ray emission similar to the x - ray clumps around radio galaxies in abell clusters and their optical environments are similar to those in poor clusters ( owen et al .",
    "1996 ) .    from these new data",
    ", it appears that the local , not the global , cluster environment is most important in influencing the radio structure .",
    "similarities in morphologies and rlfs between radio galaxies inside and outside of rich clusters may be caused , at least in part , by similarities in local environments .",
    "it appears that radio galaxies prefer to exist within clusters with complex structures / potentials , which may be evolving as a result of recent cluster / subcluster merging .",
    "supergiant ( d & cd ) galaxies are commonly found at the centers of clusters , especially those clusters with cooling flows .",
    "these galaxies are exceptional at virtually every wavelength band , including the radio ( ball , burns , & loken 1993 ) .",
    "whereas a typical elliptical in a cluster has only a 14% probability of being radio - loud ( ledlow & owen 1996 ) , a cd galaxy in a non - cooling flow cluster has a slightly higher 20% likelihood of being a radio source .",
    "this increases to 60 - 70% for a cd in a cooling flow cluster ( burns 1990 ; ledlow et al .",
    "thus , the large mass and optical brightness of the cd enhances its probability of being a radio source over that of an average elliptical , but its presence in a cooling flow greatly increases the chances of being radio - loud .",
    "furthermore , the average radio luminosity ( @xmath610@xmath7 ergs / sec ) suggests that the radio plasma energy can be a significant fraction of the thermal energy in the cooling flow if the radio luminosity is only @xmath61% of the plasma kinetic energy ; thus , the radio sources may be dynamically important influences on the cooling flow as discussed further in the next section .    for a sample of cds in abell clusters with _",
    "einstein _ or _",
    "rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) images , we do not find any correlation between @xmath8 and the @xmath9 ( 6-cm radio power ) .",
    "however , there may be a weak relationship between m and @xmath9 , such that low m clusters tend to have low power radio sources ( burns 1990 ) .",
    "there are , though , prominent exceptions such as clusters with wats which have powerful , extended radio sources yet are rarely ever found in a cooling flow .",
    "a wide variety of radio morphologies are associated with cd galaxies .",
    "many cds have typical jet / lobe radio structures ( e.g. , sources in a1795 , a2029 , a2199 ) , others have compact ( @xmath1010 kpc ) morphologies ( e.g. , a496 ) , and those not in cooling flows sometimes have wide - angle tails ( e.g. , a2634 ) .",
    "interestingly , there is a class of radio morphology that appears to exist only in clusters with cooling flows , which have been dubbed  amorphous \" ( burns 1990 ) .",
    "these sources are typically 100 - 400 kpc in diameter , have steep radio spectra , strong cores , and diffuse , quasi - spherical structure with little signs of collimated emission such as jets or lobes .",
    "examples include 3c 84/ngc 1275 in perseus ( burns et al .",
    "1992 ) and 3c317 in a2052 ( zhao et al .",
    "it appears that the cooling flows in such clusters have either disrupted the radio jets or prevented them from forming ( soker & sarazin 1988 ; loken et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "most of the radio sources associated with cds in cooling flow clusters lie within the optical envelopes of the radio galaxies ( @xmath1150 kpc ) . virtually all these radio sources have exceptionally steep radio spectra ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ) .",
    "this suggests that the sources are confined by the high thermal gas pressure at the cores of the cooling flows and allowed to spectrally age",
    ". however , cluster radio sources are often found to have equipartition pressures that are lower than the icm thermal pressure ( e.g. , taylor et al .",
    "1990 ; feretti et al .  1992 ; burns et al .",
    "this may suggest that entrainment of icm thermal gas by the radio sources is an important component of the radio plasma which is not included in the equipartition calculation .",
    "since the radio sources identified with central galaxies in cluster cooling flows are generally small , high resolution x - ray observations are needed if one is to investigate the relationship between the radio and the icm / ism plasmas .",
    "_ rosat _ hri imaging with @xmath45@xmath14 resolution is now becoming available for a number of cooling flow clusters which allows for detailed comparison with the radio structures .",
    "although the numbers of observations are still small , some possible trends are beginning to emerge .",
    "we will present our initial impressions here of these trends by dividing these clusters into 5 categories .    _",
    "radio sources blowing bubbles . _",
    "3c 84/ngc 1275 in perseus is a beautiful example of radio plasma in the core of the central galaxy apparently evacuating x - ray cavities .",
    "the hri images presented by bhringer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) show an anticorrelation between the inner radio structure and the x - ray emission within a radius of @xmath41@xmath15 of the agn core .",
    "the x - ray emission associated with the inner cooling flow is highly asymmetric and appears to have been strongly influenced by the presence of the radio source .",
    "the radio source has a relatively high total radio power of @xmath16 w / hz .    _ x - ray enhancements on the edges of radio sources .",
    "_ we have recently analyzed the hri images of 2 nearby cooling flow clusters , a133 and a2626 , which contain steep - spectrum radio sources .",
    "these are only moderately powerful radio sources at 6-cm ( @xmath17 w / hz for a133 and @xmath18 w / hz for a2626 ) . after subtracting out circular model - fits to the x - ray isophotes , we find x - ray excesses which nicely correlate with the steep - spectrum extended radio emission .",
    "the example of a133 is shown in fig .",
    "we find that inverse compton scattering of microwave background photons by the relativistic electrons in the radio plasma predicts x - ray emission which is @xmath6100 times less than what is observed .",
    "so , it appears that the x - ray excess is more likely to be hot gas ( possibly icm / ism gas compressed by the bow shock of the radio source , see below ) ; we estimate the x - ray `` clouds '' to have masses of @xmath19 m@xmath1 .",
    "= 4.2 in    _ bubbles and x - ray enhancements .",
    "_ cygnus a is an example of a cooling flow cluster which shows both x - ray enhancements near the outer hot spots of the radio lobes as well as x - ray holes within the lobes closer to the nucleus ( carilli , perley , & harris 1994 ) .",
    "clarke & harris ( 1996 ) used hydro simulations to explain these observations  the enhancements are compressed gas near the source bow shock and the x - ray holes are produced by gas which has been evacuated by the radio plasma propagating through the cooling flow .",
    "cygnus a is , of course , one of the most powerful classical double sources , @xmath20 w / hz .    _ x - ray extensions between the radio tails / lobes .",
    "_ we have also begun to see a few interesting examples of correlations between asymmetries in the inner cooling flows and bent radio structures .",
    "a2597 ( sarazin et al .  1995 ; @xmath21 w / hz ) and a2199/3c 338 ( owen & eilek 1997 ; @xmath22 w / hz ) show excess x - ray emission between the radio tails or lobes of these small linear size sources .",
    "both the x - ray asymmetries and the bent radio sources suggest that there are important pressure gradients within the inner cooling flow regions of these cd galaxies .",
    "_ alignment of radio source with dust & emission - line gas .",
    "_ finally , a recent , spectacular example of an unanticipated correlation between inner dust lanes , outer emission - line gas , and extended radio features has been revealed for a1795 using new hst imaging ( pinkney et al .",
    "1996 ; mcnamara et al .",
    "clearly , these phenomena are all related in a yet - to - be - determined manner , making the inner cooling flow environment far more complex than previously believed .    in summary , the new hri and hst images for cooling flows with",
    "central radio sources clearly show them to be highly nonspherical .",
    "both the radio luminosities and now the x - ray / radio correlations suggest that the radio plasma has an important impact on the central structure of the cooling flow .",
    "the highest radio power sources ( e.g. , cygnus a & 3c 84 ) are capable of blowing bubbles or evacuating cavities in the inner cooling flow region , whereas lower radio power sources can produce x - ray excesses which coincide with the outer portions of the radio structures .",
    "in an effort to understand the complex relationship between extended radio sources and the cooling flow environment , loken et al .",
    "( 1993 ) performed the first numerical simulations of supersonic radio jets propagating through a realistic cooling flow atmosphere .",
    "these 2-d hydrodynamics simulations launched 4 jets of differing mach numbers ( 3 , 6 , 12 , and 50 as measured with respect to the jet internal sound speed ) into a steady - state cooling flow .",
    "one example of the end state of a 1.3 kpc long , m=12 jet is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    for a laminar jet",
    ", one can show using simple ram pressure balance that the morphology and length of a radio jet should be a strong function of jet and cooling inflow mach numbers ( loken et al .",
    "clearly , lower mach number jets ( lower thrust ) should not travel as far into a high inflow velocity cooling flow as would a high mach number jet in a low velocity cooling flow .",
    "however , this naive calculation does not consider the fact that fluid shear or kelvin - helmholtz instabilities play a dominant role as the jet fluid attempts to propagate through the inflowing cooling cluster gas .",
    "the jets become unstable , ultimately disrupt , and stagnate as shown in fig .",
    "the disruption length of a jet is once again a strong function of jet and cooling flow mach numbers .",
    "thus , a m=3 jet stagnates close to the radio core , whereas a high mach number jet can  blow through \" the central cooling flow with little effect . this may be why low luminosity radio sources in central cooling flow galaxies are generally small ( low thrust jets ) , whereas a powerful source such as cygnus a is able to grow to a diameter of @xmath4200 kpc .    for the m=12 jet simulation shown in fig .",
    "2 , we have computed the projected x - ray brightness distribution in the _ rosat _ band produced by the hot ism / icm surrounding the jet .",
    "we find that the x - ray brightness around the jet is @xmath410 - 20% higher than would be expected from the cooling flow alone .",
    "it appears that the jet bow shock has compressed and heated the gas in a shell around the radio source .",
    "since this jet is within the inner @xmath42 kpc of the cooling flow center where the gas temperature is only @xmath410@xmath23 k , the bow shock heating produces a significant enhancement in x - ray emissivity in the _ rosat _ band .",
    "thus , x - ray excesses on the edges of radio components such as that seen in fig .",
    "1 may be understood as shocked , compressed gas produced as the radio plasma propagates through the cores of cooling flows .",
    "although many ( possibly most ) galaxy clusters contain cooling flows , there are also a number of clusters whose temperature and x - ray surface brightness profiles suggest a more isothermal gas at the cluster core .",
    "two good examples of such classes of non - cooling flow clusters are those which contain wide - angle tailed radio galaxies ( e.g. , gmez et al .",
    "1997 ) and radio halos ( burns et al .",
    "both of these classes of clusters show strong evidence for substructure in x - ray images ( e.g. , briel et al .",
    "1991 for the radio halo cluster a2256 ) and in cluster velocity distributions ( e.g. , pinkney et al .",
    "1993 for the wat cluster a2634 ) .",
    "these data have been used to model these clusters as candidates for cluster - cluster mergers ( e.g. , roettiger et al .  1995 ; 1997 ) .",
    "do such mergers also destroy previously existing cooling flows ? to address this question , we performed 2-d simulations of a merger between two idealized spherical clusters with a mass ratio of 4:1 using our hydro / n - body code ( see roettiger et al .",
    "1997 for details ) . in the larger cluster with @xmath24 m@xmath1 , @xmath25=11.7 kev , and @xmath26=250 kpc , a steady - state cooling flow with mass dropout",
    "was initially evolved in 1-d and then placed within the 2-d grid .",
    "the second cluster was initially isothermal with @xmath25=6.6 kev and @xmath26=157 kpc .",
    "the two clusters were allowed to fall together under the influence of gravity . in this simulation , cooling via bremsstrahlung and line radiation was activated using the cooling function described in westbury & henriksen ( 1992 ) .",
    "three epochs during the cluster - cluster collision are displayed in fig .",
    "the net effect of the collision is strong shock heating of the cooling flow core which causes it to expand , the temperature increases in the core from 1.5 kev to 15 kev , and the cooling time increases to @xmath27 gyrs in the final epoch .",
    "thus , for the particular parameters in this simulation , the cooling flow is effectively destroyed and will not become re - established within a hubble time .",
    "it is probably premature to generalize this result to the life history of most clusters .",
    "this is a ",
    "hard \" , head - on collision ( high momenta ) between two massive clusters which may be relatively rare in the universe .",
    "although cosmological large - scale structure simulations do find that clusters grow hierarchically through mergers and accretion of gas and dark matter along filaments ( e.g. , bryan et al .",
    "1994 ; loken et al .",
    "1997 ) , this process may generally be softer and not destroy a cooling flow in all cases",
    ". such a picture must be true to explain both the preponderance of substructure and cooling flows in nearby clusters .",
    "we are in the process of performing additional simulations with higher mass ratios to explore this issue further .",
    "there appears to be a very strong correlation between radio emission and the presence of cooling flows around central galaxies in clusters .",
    "nearly three - quarters of cd galaxies at the centers of cooling flows are radio - loud whereas only 14% of average cluster ellipticals have radio emission in surveys of abell clusters .",
    "radio sources associated with dominant galaxies in cooling flows tend to be small ( @xmath28 kpc in diameter ) and have steep radio spectra ( @xmath29=1 - 2 ) .",
    "a class of radio source , termed amorphous , which have little collimated emission ( i.e. , jets or lobes ) and instead have a core - halo ( steep spectrum halo ) morphology are found to exist only in cooling flows .",
    "new _ rosat _ hri images reveal strong interactions between radio plasma and the centers of cooling flows .",
    " bubbles \" or evacuated cavities are seen in the x - ray emission in cooling flows around the most powerful radio sources such as 3c 84 in the perseus cluster and near the classical double cygnus a. in other cases such as a133 and a2626 , enhancements of x - ray emission are seen on the edges of the extended radio emission , possibly produced by compression and heating of the ism / icm by the radio source bow shock as suggested by numerical simulations . finally , in yet other cases such as a2199 and a2597 , we observe alignments between bent radio jets / tails and extended central x - ray emission . in virtually every cooling flow cluster with a central radio source",
    ", the x - ray emission is observed to be highly asymmetric .",
    "such properties need to be considered in modeling cooling flows ( see e.g. , garasi et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "new hydro / n - body simulations suggest that cooling flows can be destroyed by low mass ratio cluster - cluster collisions .",
    "such collisions are consistent with x - ray and optical observations of clusters which contain wat radio galaxies or cluster halos  neither of which possess cooling flows .",
    "further simulations will be needed to reconcile the observed abundance of both cooling flow clusters and substructure ( i.e. , merging ) within clusters .",
