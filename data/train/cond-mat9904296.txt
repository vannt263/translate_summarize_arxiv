    "optimization methods have found widespread application in computational physics . among these",
    "the investigation of the low - temperature behavior of spin glasses @xcite attracted most of the attention within the statistical physics community .",
    "the reason is that despite its simple definition ( see below ) its behavior is far from being understood . from the computational point of view",
    "the calculation of spin - glass ground states is very demanding , because it belongs to the class of the np - hard problems @xcite .",
    "this means that only algorithms are available , for which the running time on a computer increases exponentially with the system size . in this work",
    "a method recently proposed , the _ cluster - exact approximation _ ( cea ) @xcite is applied to four - dimensional ising spin glasses .",
    "the model under investigation here consists of @xmath6 spins @xmath7 , described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes a sum over pair of nearest neighbors . in this report",
    "simple 4d lattices are considered , i.e. @xmath10 . the nearest neighbor interactions ( bonds ) take independently @xmath11 with equal probability .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied to the systems .",
    "no kind of external magnetic field is present here .",
    "four - dimensional ising spin glasses have been investigated rather rarely .",
    "most of the results were obtained via monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations at finite temperature , see e.g. @xcite . here the @xmath12 behavior is investigated , i.e. ground states are calculated .",
    "this has the advantage , that one does not encounter ergodicity problems or critical slowing down like in algorithms which base on mc methods .",
    "only one attempt @xcite to address the 4d spin - glass ground - state problem is known to the author .",
    "but , as we will see later , the former results suffer from the problem , that not the true global minima of the energy were obtained .",
    "furthermore , no analytic predictions of the ground - state energy have been noted by the author .",
    "the question whether finite - dimensional ising spin glasses show an ordered phase below a non - zero transition temperature @xmath5 is of crucial interest . by mc simulations around the ( expected ) transition temperature",
    "this question is hard to solve . another way to address",
    "this question is to calculate the _ stiffness _ or _",
    "domain wall energy _",
    "@xmath13 which is the difference between the ground - state energies @xmath14 for antiperiodic and periodic boundary conditions in one direction@xcite . here",
    "the antiperiodic boundary conditions for calculating @xmath15 are realized by inverting one plane of bonds . for the other directions",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied always .",
    "this treatment introduces a domain wall into the system .",
    "if a model exhibits an ordered low - temperature phase , the domain wall increases with growing system size , which becomes visible through the behavior of @xmath2 : the disorder - averaged stiffness energy shows a finite size dependence @xmath16 a positive value of the stiffness exponent @xmath17 indicates the existence of an ordered phase for non - zero temperature .",
    "for example a simple @xmath18 ising ferromagnet has @xmath19 . for spin glasses",
    ", the stiffness exponent plays additionally an important role within the droplet - scaling theory @xcite , where it describes the finite - size behavior of the basic excitations ( the droplets ) .",
    "using this kind of analysis is was proven that the 2d spin glass exhibits no ordering for @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "for the three - dimensional problem in a recent calculation @xcite by applying genetic cea a value of @xmath21 was found , which shows , that indeed the @xmath22 model has a spin - glass phase for nonzero temperature .",
    "for @xmath23 the existence of a finite @xmath24 was proven rather early even by mc simulations @xcite , but the value for the stiffness - exponent @xmath17 is of interest on its own . in @xcite",
    "recently a value of @xmath25 was found by performing a mc simulation near @xmath5 . in the work presented here the value",
    "is obtained via ground - state calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section the algorithm applied here is briefly presented .",
    "the main section contains the results for the ground - state energy and the stiffness exponent .",
    "finally a summary is given .",
    "the technique for the calculation bases on a special genetic algorithm @xcite and on cluster - exact approximation @xcite which is an optimization method designed especially for spin glasses .",
    "now a brief description of the method is given .",
    "genetic algorithms are biologically motivated .",
    "an optimal solution is found by treating many instances of the problem in parallel , keeping only better instances and replacing bad ones by new ones ( survival of the fittest ) .",
    "the genetic algorithm starts with an initial population of @xmath26 randomly initialized spin configurations (= _ individuals _ ) , which are linearly arranged in a ring .",
    "then @xmath27 times two neighbors from the population are taken ( called _ parents _ ) and two offspring are created using the so called triadic crossover @xcite .",
    "then a mutation with a rate of @xmath28 is applied to each offspring , i.e. a fraction @xmath28 of the spins is reversed .",
    "next for both offspring the energy is reduced by applying cea .",
    "the algorithm bases on the concept of _ frustration _ @xcite .",
    "the method constructs iteratively and randomly a non - frustrated cluster of spins , whereas spins with many unsatisfied bonds are more likely to be added to the cluster .",
    "the non - cluster spins act like local magnetic fields on the cluster spins .",
    "for the spins of the cluster an energetic minimum state can be calculated in polynomial time by using graph - theoretical methods @xcite : an equivalent network is constructed @xcite , the maximum flow is calculated @xcite and the spins of the cluster are set to the orientations leading to a minimum in energy . this minimization step is performed @xmath29 times for each offspring .    afterwards",
    "each offspring is compared with one of its parents .",
    "the pairs are chosen in the way that the sum of the phenotypic differences between them is minimal .",
    "the phenotypic difference is defined here as the number of spin where the two configurations differ .",
    "each parent is replaced if its energy is not lower ( i.e. better ) than the corresponding offspring .",
    "after this creation of offspring is performed @xmath27 times the population is halved : from each pair of neighbors the configuration which has the higher energy is eliminated .",
    "if not more than 4 individuals remain the process is stopped and the best individual is taken as result of the calculation .",
    "the whole algorithm is performed @xmath30 times and all configurations which exhibit the lowest energy are stored , resulting in @xmath31 statistical independent ground state configurations .",
    "the method was already applied for the investigation of the ground - state landscape of 3d ising spin glasses @xcite .",
    "in this section at first the values for the simulation parameters , which are defined above , are presented .",
    "then the finite - size behavior of the ground - state energy is investigated .",
    "finally results for the stiffness energy are discussed .",
    "the simulation parameters were determined in the following way : for the system sizes @xmath32 several different combinations of the parameters @xmath33 were tested . for the final parameter sets it is not possible to obtain lower energies even by using parameters where the calculation consumes four times the computational effort . for @xmath34 the parameter sets for @xmath35 were used . using parameter sets chosen this way",
    "genetic cea calculates true ground states , as shown in @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that it is relatively easy to obtain states , which exhibit an energy slightly above the true ground state energy .",
    "the hard task is to obtain really the global minimum of the energy .    here",
    "@xmath37 were used for all system sizes . table [ tab_parameters ] summarizes the parameters . also the typical computer time @xmath38 per ground state computation on a 80 mhz ppc601 is given .",
    "ground states were calculated for system sizes up to @xmath39 for @xmath40 independent realizations ( see table [ tab_parameters ] ) of the random variables . for each realization the ground states with periodic and antiperiodic boundary condition in one direction were calculated .",
    "the remaining three directions are always subjected to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "one can extract from the table that for small system sizes @xmath41 ground states are rather easily to obtain , while the @xmath42 systems alone required 6560 cpu - days . using these parameters on average @xmath43 ground states",
    "were obtained for every system size @xmath44 using @xmath37 runs per realization .",
    "the average ground - state energy @xmath45 per spin is shown in fig.[figenergy ] as a function of the system size @xmath44 . using a fit to @xmath46 the value for the infinite system",
    "is extrapolated , resulting in @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this value is compatible with the lower bound of @xmath49 given by the random energy model @xcite .",
    "the value calculated here is substantially smaller than the result @xmath50 , which was obtained in @xcite using a pure genetic algorithm .",
    "this shows that in @xcite not the true global minima were found , which can be concluded also from the fact , that there @xmath51 increases with growing system size .",
    "because the periodic boundary conditions impose additional constraints on the systems , the opposite behavior is expected , as found for the results presented here . for further comparison",
    "additionally some calculations were performed by the author by simply rapidly quenching from random chosen spin configurations . by executing an analogous fit ,",
    "a value of @xmath52 is obtained .",
    "this shows , that the result from @xcite seems to be only slightly better than the data obtained by applying a very simple minimization method .    the distribution of the stiffness energy , which is obtained from performing ground - state calculations for systems with either periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions in one direction , are shown in fig .",
    "[ figpstiff ] for @xmath53 and @xmath42 . with increasing system size",
    "the distribution broadens .",
    "this means that larger domain walls become more and more likely . to study this effect more quantitatively , in fig .",
    "[ figstiffness ] the disorder - averaged absolute value @xmath54 of the stiffness energy is plotted as a function of the system size @xmath44 .",
    "also shown is a fit @xmath55 which results in @xmath56 . here",
    ", the system sizes @xmath57 were left out of the analysis , since they are below the scaling regime .",
    "because of the large sample sizes the error bars are small enough , so we can be pretty sure that @xmath58 .",
    "it confirms earlier results from mc simulations @xcite that the 4d ea spin glass exhibits a non - zero transition temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the value @xmath56 is comparable to a recent result from mc simulations @xmath25 @xcite , given the facts that the system sizes are rather small and the other result was obtained at finite temperature near the transition point @xmath24 .",
    "additionally , the prediction from droplet - scaling theory @xmath59 @xcite is fulfilled .",
    "it should be pointed out , that the method described above does not guaranty to find exact ground states , although the method for choosing the parameters makes it very likely .",
    "if states with a slightly higher energy are obtained , the result for @xmath60 is not affected very much . for the stiffness energy ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the result is very reliable as well , as long as the energies of the states are not too far away from the true ground - state energies .",
    "results have been presented from calculations of a large number of ground states of 4d ising spin glasses .",
    "they were obtained using a combination of cluster - exact approximation and a genetic algorithm . using a huge computational effort",
    "it was ensured that true ground states have been obtained with a high probability .",
    "the finite size behavior of the ground - state energy and the stiffness energy have been investigated . by performing a @xmath61 extrapolation ,",
    "the ground - state energy per spin for the infinite system is estimated to be @xmath1 .",
    "the absolute value of the stiffness energy increases with system size and shows a @xmath62 behavior with @xmath56 . for systems with a gaussian distribution of the bonds qualitatively similar results",
    "are expected , since the ordering behavior depends only on the sign of the interactions and not on their magnitudes .",
    "a more detailed study of the ground - state landscape of 4d systems , similar to @xcite , requires more than @xmath63 ground states per realization to be calculated .",
    "since this requires a substantial higher computational effort , it remains to be done for the future .",
