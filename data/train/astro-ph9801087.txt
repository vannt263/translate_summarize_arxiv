    "as the temperature of the cosmic bath decreases , atoms start to recombine and therefore decouple from cmb radiation at redshift @xmath0 . the baryonic jeans mass after this event is given by ( assuming @xmath1 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gas temperature and @xmath4 the baryon density parameter .",
    "masses larger than @xmath5 are gravitationally unstable and should , in principle , collapse . however , in order for the actual collapse to occur a more severe condition must be satisfied , that the cooling time of the gas is shorter than the hubble time at that epoch ; in fact radiative losses provide the only way for the gas to lose pressure and to settle down in the potential well of the dark matter halo . since the virial temperature corresponding to pop  iii object masses is typically @xmath6 , cooling by hydrogen ly@xmath7 excitation is strongly quenched , and the only viable coolant in a primordial h - he plasma is molecular hydrogen .",
    "@xmath8 is produced during the recombination phase , but its relic abundance is so small that it contibutes only marginally to the cooling .",
    "however , its fractional abundance increases during the collapse phase along with the density , finally becoming dominant .",
    "tegmark ( 1997 ) have determined the minimum mass necessary for collapse and they find that these first objects in a standard cdm model should form at redshift @xmath9 and have total masses @xmath10 . during the collapse ,",
    "if fragmentation occurs , a stellar cluster is likely to be formed with a stellar mass , @xmath11 , which depends on the ( unknown ) details of the star formation process .",
    "an educated guess , based both on the experimental data available for the galaxy and on theoretical arguments , suggests that @xmath12 . the number of massive stars and supernovae produced depends on the postulated imf ; if the latter is not too steep , it is reasonable to expect that the pop iii star cluster will be a source both of ionizing photons and ( explosive ) energy injection in the surrounding environment . in the next section",
    "we provide some estimates of these effects and finally we discuss how these ( very ) high redshift supernovae might be close to enter the realm of visibility in the next few years , thanks to their relatively strong magnification due to the intervening cosmological matter distribution .",
    "as pop iii objects start to shine ionizing photons produced by their pristine stellar clusters , they will create an approximately spherical ionized ( hii ) region in the surrounding igm .",
    "the radius of each sphere is relatively small ( @xmath13  mpc ) ; this value depends linearly on the ( unknown ) value the fraction of ionizing photons escaping from the pop iii ism , here assumed to be @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the reionization epoch , defined as the @xmath15 at which the ionized spheres overlap , is rather delayed with respect to the formation of the pop iii , @xmath16 ( ciardi & ferrara 1997 ) .",
    "the above calculation requires that the galaxy formation follows closely the underlying hierarchical clustering that aggregates dark matter halos .",
    "this , however , needs not to be the case .",
    "in fact , in addition to ionizing the intergalactic hydrogen , the emitted radiation in the soft - uv band @xmath17  ev is also able to photodissociate @xmath8 molecules inside collapsing objects , thus temporary inhibiting the formation of objects smaller than the mass threshold for the ignition of ly@xmath7 cooling ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this process is often referred to as a kind of \" negative feedback  , according to haiman 1997 , who first suggested that such mechanism can be at work .",
    "more recently , this negative role of pop iii on subsequent galaxy formation has been revisited by ciardi , abel & ferrara ( 1998 ) . without entering the details of their argument",
    ", the main point is that it appears that haiman ( 1997 ) have considerably overestimated the photodissociating soft - uv radiation produced by pop iii objects , calculated by the crucial assumption that hii spheres ( and consequently the photodissociation spheres ) overlap already at high @xmath15 . instead ,",
    "as discussed above , overlap occurs only much later , at an epoch at which the role of @xmath8 cooling in the collapsing galaxies has become negligible with respect to atomic cooling , thus strongly reducing , if not even suppressing , the alleged negative feedback .      in the likely situation",
    "in which stars more massive than @xmath19 are born in the pop iii stellar cluster , supernovae will start to explode after a few million years .",
    "even if the stars in the cluster are all coeval ( born from the same initial burst of star formation ) supernovae will explode at different times due to their mass spread . for a stellar cluster inside a pop iii with properties as the ones discussed above , we expect , for a miller - scalo imf , about @xmath20 supernovae to blow off .",
    "the total mechanical luminosity of such a multi - sn explosion , approximated as a continuous energy injection , is of the order of @xmath21  erg  s@xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the energy of a single supernova explosion and @xmath24  yr is the typical lifetime of a massive star association .",
    "the point to be appreciated is that pop iii objects , due to their low mass and binding energy , are very fragile objects and tend to be _ blown - away _",
    "( ciardi & ferrara 1997 ) by explosions : a number @xmath25 of supernovae will suffice to disrupt the object , where @xmath26 . since for our reference stellar cluster @xmath27 , its residual gas content will be swept away by the expanding multi - sn driven shock and lost to the igm . as a result",
    ", further star formation will be inhibited and the remaining low mass stellar population will continue to evolve passively . the final fate of this object is not yet clear : stars can become unbound due to dynamical instabilities following the blow - away or they can steadily evaporate from the stellar cluster and be lost in the field ; the timescale of these processes , though , should be compared with the one for merging .",
    "the gas injected in the igm is enriched by the heavy elements produced by supernova nucleosynthesis processes .",
    "assuming that the mass in heavy elements averaged on a miller - scalo imf is @xmath28 we estimate that the metallicity inside a secondary halo corresponding to a blow - away event driven by @xmath29 supernovae is @xmath30 or @xmath31 at @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this estimate shows that pop iii objects might be responsible for the origin of polluted regions of relatively high metallicity , althougth of rather small ( sub - kpc ) size .",
    "hence , the enrichment of the universe might very well have been very patchy in its early phases .",
    "pop iii supernova events as the ones discussed in the previous section should represent one of the best tracers of star formation at ( very ) high redshift .",
    "the typical luminosity of a type ii sn is of order @xmath34  erg  s@xmath22 ; the luminosity of a @xmath35 pop iii object , assuming a reasonable mass - to - light ratio , is about 100 - 1000 times smaller .",
    "in addition to what we can learn on the formation of the first objects , pop iii sne can provide crucial information on cosmological models due to their different predictions concerning the gravitational lensing magnification patterns by the intervening matter in the universe .    to investigate this and other aspects ,",
    "we have have recently undertaken a project aimed at simulating the magnification properties of sne located at redshift @xmath36 , and lensed by the matter distribution predicted by three different cosmological models : scdm ( standard cold dark matter : @xmath37 ) , lcdm ( lambda cold dark matter : @xmath38 ) , chdm ( cold hot dark matter : @xmath39 ) ; all models have @xmath40 and are cobe normalized .",
    "the detailed description of the models , simulations and results are presented in marri & ferrara ( 1998 ) ; here we concentrate on some aspects concerning the magnification probabilities of sne .",
    "technically speaking , the matter distribution in the universe behaves like a thick gravitational lens .",
    "such 3d distribution must be approximated as a sequence of planes , on which the matter is projected , separated by a given redshift interval ( typically @xmath41 ) .",
    "we assume that the lensing matter is all contained in collapsed point - like dark halos ( we neglect baryons at this stage ) whose number density as a function of mass and redshift is calculated using the press - schechter formalism ; obviously , this quantity depends on the given cosmological model .",
    "such lenses are then distributed randomly on each plane , neglecting any possible clustering effect .",
    "our numerical outputs are a set of magnification maps displaying the magnification , @xmath42 ( the source flux enhancement factor ) of a point source located at a given spatial position inside the considered @xmath43 field of view .",
    "there are several unambiguous differences among the three families of cosmological models that we can identify by analysing the magnification maps .",
    "scdm models give intense , but not very numerous caustics ( @xmath44 ) for @xmath45 ; intermediate magnification caustics appear at higher @xmath36 due to lower mass objects that have not yet hierarchically merged into larger ones .",
    "lcdm models produce the most intense caustics ( @xmath46 ) , but most of the map is covered with more diffuse and lower @xmath42 magnification patterns .",
    "finally , chdm models , which form large structures later than @xmath47 , show very rare intense events and many moderate @xmath42 caustics .",
    "we have performed extensive statistical analysis of the magnification maps .",
    "here we present some results for the cumulative source magnification probability , @xmath48 , that is the probability that a source in our field is magnified by more than a value @xmath42 . in terms of this distribution",
    ", we can define two useful quantities : ( i ) @xmath49 , or the largest magnification with a probability larger than 10% , and ( ii ) @xmath50 , or the probability of magnification larger than 10 ( high magnification probability ) .",
    "1 shows the evolution of @xmath49 ( top panel ) and @xmath50 ( bottom ) , with the source redshift .",
    "first , we note that magnifications higher than @xmath51 are very likely ( @xmath52% ) for all the cosmological models considered ; this fact strongly enhances the chance of detection of high redshift sne ( marri & ferrara 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , magnification in scdm and lcdm models shows appreciable evolution even at redshift larger than 5 , whereas chdm magnifications saturate at that epoch , since little action is going on at higher redshifts in that particular model .",
    "hence , gravitational lensing of very high @xmath15 sources can prove to be a very sharp tool to discriminate among different cosmological models . by inspecting the bottom panel of fig . 1",
    ", we also see that there is more than 1% chance to obtain magnifications @xmath52 at high redshift for the three models . a caveat to keep in mind",
    "is that this value might be somewhat overestimated by our assumption of point - like lenses and underestimated if clustering is present .",
    "future work will include a more realistic schematization of these variables .",
    "we summarize here the main points of the paper :    * pop iii objects form at @xmath53 , provide the first light after cmb and start to reionize the universe .",
    "they also _ partially _ photodissociate the relic @xmath8 , but the negative feedback on galaxy formation , responsible for a temporary halt in the galaxy formation sequence , is probably not taking place , as discussed by ciardi ( 1998 ) .",
    "* blow - away of pop iii seems unavoidable if their masses are of the order of @xmath35 .",
    "metal enriched gas is cast into the igm , producing regions of relatively high ( @xmath54 ) metallicity which , however are distributed with a patchy pattern . * high redshift sne in popiii lensed by the intervening cosmological matter distribution",
    "have considerable chance ( @xmath55% ) to get magnified by more than 10 times .",
    "thus , detection chances of these primordial objects are enhanced ; at the same time , lensing of high-@xmath15 objects will likely allow to discriminate among cosmological models ."
