    "the current canonical pulsar paradigm is that of a magnetized rotating neutron star ( see mestel  1999 for a review ) .",
    "however , we feel that certain fundamental aspects of the paradigm still remain unclear .    one aspect of the paradigm which we hope to elucidate in the present work has to do with the way the neutron star spins down .",
    "a spinning down neutron star with mass @xmath4 , radius @xmath5 , and angular velocity @xmath6 loses rotational kinetic energy at a rate @xmath7 here , @xmath8 , @xmath9  km , and @xmath10 .",
    "energy is lost through electromagnetic torques in the magnetosphere , although other physical processes have at times also been discussed ( gravitational radiation , wind outflow , star - disk interaction , etc . ) .    to a first approximation",
    ", the stellar magnetic field may be considered as that of a rotating magnetic dipole .",
    "even under such a simplification the general description of the stellar magnetosphere is a formidable three dimensional problem , since , in general , the magnetic and rotation axes do not coincide . awaiting the development of the general theory , one can still derive important conclusions based on two idealized limiting cases which have been studied in great extent : the case of an aligned magnetic dipole rotating in an atmosphere with freely available electric charges ( i.e. with ideal mhd conditions ) , and that of a misaligned magnetic dipole rotating in vacuum .",
    "the neutron star is not surrounded by vacuum , and one needs to take into consideration the electric fields that develop and the electric currents that flow in the rotating charged magnetosphere ( goldreich & julian  1969 ) . the most recent numerical calculation of the simplest possible case , that of the magnetosphere of an aligned rotator in force - free approximation ( contopoulos  2005 , hereafter c05 ) , yielded the following rather general result for the electromagnetic energy loss @xmath11 ( the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are defined below ) . in that picture , the magnetosphere consists of a corotating region of closed fieldlines which extends up to a distance @xmath14 from the rotation axis , and an open fieldline region with enclosed magnetic flux @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the polar value of the magnetic field ( contopoulos , kazanas & fendt  1999 , hereafter ckf ; gruzinov 2005 ; c05 ; timokhin 2005 ; see also appendix  a ) .",
    "the above expression is valid when @xmath17 . in the limit @xmath18 , straightforward calculation yields @xmath19 .",
    "the neutron star spins down because of the establishment of a large scale poloidal electric current circuit flowing along open field lines , and returning along the edge of the open field line region ( see ckf for a detailed description ) .",
    "the electric current that flows between the magnetic axis ( characterized by @xmath20 ) and the edge of the open field line region ( characterized by @xmath21 ) generates the spindown torque which leads to eq .",
    "[ c05 ] . the quantity @xmath22 in eq .",
    "[ c05 ] is the angular frequency of rotation of the open field lines .",
    "it is set by the electric potential drop that develops accross open field lines , between the magnetic axis and the edge of the open field line region .",
    "this potential in the magnetosphere is in general smaller than the corresponding electric potential drop on the surface of the star .",
    "the difference between the two potential drops is just the particle acceleration gap potential which develops _ along _ open magnetic field lines in the vicinity of the polar cap .",
    "consequently , the angular velocity of open field lines will in general be different ( smaller ) than @xmath6 .",
    "models of particle acceleration and pair creation of rotation - powered pulsars yield values of the gap potential @xmath23 of the order of @xmath24  volts ( e.g. hibschmann & arons 2001 ) .",
    "one can directly show ( see appendix  b ) that the above together with the simplifying assumption that @xmath12 is uniform accross open field lines , yield @xmath25 where , @xmath26 this describes the so - called pulsar ` death ' , i.e. the stopping of pulsar emission .",
    "as the neutron star slows down and @xmath6 drops below @xmath27 , the gap potential can not attain the value required for particle acceleration and consequent pulse generation , and the pulsar stops generating radio emission .",
    "a misaligned dipole rotating in vacuum loses energy at a rate @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the misalignment angle between the magnetic and rotation axes .",
    "we know that in real life the neutron star is not surrounded by vacuum , and we may argue that , in analogy to the aligned case , the magnetosphere consists of a corotating and an open line region",
    ". we may thus rewrite eq .",
    "[ dipole1 ] in a more general form that expresses the energy loss rate of an orthogonal ( @xmath30 ) magnetic rotator as @xmath31    we would like to emphasize at this point that eqs .",
    "[ c05 ] & [ dipole1 ] being so similar , led most researchers to ignore the dependence on @xmath29 and @xmath12 in estimates of stellar magnetic fields , and in most studies of the @xmath0 diagram .",
    "the aim of the present work is to show that the dependence on @xmath29 and @xmath12 is important and should not be ignored , especially in old pulsars approaching their death .",
    "as we will see , pulsar death manifests itself in a most interesting way through its dependence on @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath29 dependence ` softens ' the distribution of pulsars around the death line in the @xmath0 diagram .",
    "in real life , pulsars are neither aligned nor perpendicular rotators .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to expect that the two electromagnetic energy loss terms described in eqs .",
    "[ c05 ] & [ dipole ] contribute together in the total energy loss .",
    "a possible combination is : @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 we stress that this combination , although inspired by physical limiting cases , is not a rigorous derivation .",
    "an exact expression will require the development of a detailed non - axisymmetric mhd theory of the pulsar magnetosphere . as we will show , however , this rather simple general expression accounts qualitatively for the main contributions in the electromagnetic energy loss mechanism .",
    "a key element in the present discussion is what determines @xmath13 , or equivalently , what determines the equatorial extent @xmath14 of the closed line region . in the context of force - free ideal mhd ,",
    "the only natural length scale is the light cylinder distance @xmath35 .",
    "we could have directly assumed that @xmath14 is close to @xmath36 , i.e. that the corotating closed line region extends up to the light cylinder distance ( see ckf ) .",
    "but this does not answer the question how the corotating region follows the light cylinder as the star spins down and the light cylinder moves out . obviously , in order for @xmath14 to follow @xmath36",
    ", the corotating closed line region must grow through _ north - south poloidal magnetic field reconnection around @xmath14_. one may consider two limiting cases :    * reconnection is very efficient , and the extent of the closed line region follows closely the light cylinder , i.e. @xmath37 * reconnection is very inefficient , and the closed line region can not grow . in that case , @xmath38 one might argue that the supernova explosion that led to the formation of the spinning neutron star blew the magnetic field open , and the magnetic field remained open since then .    we are going to consider a simple parametric model where @xmath14 is neither equal nor proportional to @xmath36 , but is equal to @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the values of @xmath36 and @xmath6 at pulsar birth repsectively , and @xmath42 .",
    "equation  [ lgeneral ] has a _ different from dipolar _ dependence on @xmath6 , i.e. a dependence different from @xmath43 .",
    "this accounts for braking index values @xmath44 ( we introduce here the first and second order braking indices @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively ) .",
    "we have presented here a natural physical model that accounts for braking indices @xmath44 , namely a corotating closed line region which does not extend up to the light cylinder but follows the light cylinder at an increasing distance .",
    "the dependence of energy loss on the extent of the magnetosphere and its effect on the braking index was noted in the past ( blandford & romani 1988 ; harding _ et al . _  1999 ; alvarez & carramiana  2004 ; gruzinov 2005b ; timokhin 2005 ) , with gruzinov ( 2005b ) and timokhin ( 2005 ) introducing the same evolutionary parametrization as in ( [ rcn ] ) .",
    "the physical motivation of the extent of the closed zone varies between the authors ( e.g. , inertial stresses by the wind in blandford & romani 1988 and in harding _",
    "et al . _  1999 ,",
    "obliqueness effects in gruzinov 2005b , or inability of pulsar gaps to supply necessary poloidal currents in timokhin 2005 ) .",
    "our view , however , that @xmath47 might be due to insufficiently fast reconnection near the y - point in the outer magnetosphere is original and worthy of further study .    more importantly , though , eq .  [ lgeneral ] brings a new element to the discussion : _ we directly introduce pulsar death and magnetic - rotation axes misalignment in the electromagnetic pulsar spindown expression .",
    "_ pulsar death expresses the inability of the magnetosphere to generate the particles required in the poloidal electric currents which generate spindown torques in the aligned rotator case .",
    "they do not affect the orthogonal spindown component though . beyond the death line , the misaligned neutron star will continue to spin down without emitting pulsar radiation .",
    "evolutionary diagram that shows the effect of the misalignment angle @xmath29 .",
    "we show spindown trajectories for pulsars with initial period @xmath48  msec , magnetic field @xmath49  g , and @xmath50  volt .",
    "initial braking index @xmath51 is assumed ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "trajectories from bottom to top correspond to pulsars with increasing magnetic inclination angle from @xmath53 to @xmath54 with @xmath55 increments .",
    "rectangular dots indicate when pulsars reach @xmath56 and turn off .",

    "oblique pulsars evolve faster through the diagram . ]",
    "in order to study how pulsars spin down , we equate the values of @xmath57 in eqs .",
    "[ kinetic ] & [ lgeneral ] and thus obtain @xmath58 @xmath59 where from ( [ om_death ] ) @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 is the initial period at pulsar birth . note that we have introduced an angular dependence in the definition of the death line @xmath63 . as we will see below ,",
    "this has interesting observational consequences .",
    "note also that , in the limit @xmath64 and @xmath52 , we obtain the following simple expression @xmath65 which can also be written as @xmath66 ( compare with zhang , harding & muslimov  2000 ) . when @xmath67 , @xmath68 and pulsars evolve in the logarithmic @xmath0 diagram along lines of constant magnetic field @xmath69 .",
    "as @xmath70 approaches @xmath71 , however , the evolution curves down away from the above straight lines and ends at a point @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this evolution is similar to what one would expect if we had assumed magnetic field decay in the standard dipole spindown model ( e.g. gonthier  _ et al . _  2002 and 2004 ,",
    "hereafter g02 and g04 respectively ) . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show only @xmath52 , or evolution with initial braking index @xmath51 .",
    "for @xmath1 the straight portion of the lines would rotate counterclockwise , and would become horizontal for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "such pulsars would also evolve faster .    as a test of the validity of our results , we tried to reproduce the observed distribution of pulsars in the @xmath0 diagram with the minimum number of assumptions possible , through a simple monte carlo numerical experiment that follows g02 and g04 .",
    "we integrated eq .",
    "[ pdot ] for random times @xmath76 within a @xmath77  year time interval ( this mimics random pulsar birth in the galaxy ) .",
    "the result of the integration is recorded only if the star remains active as a pulsar , i.e. only if @xmath78 . to make our results more realistic",
    ", we assumed a multipeaked lognormal distribution of polar magnetic fields around @xmath79 ( eq .  1 in g02 ) :",
    "we used two terms with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "we assumed a uniform random distribution of initial pulse periods from 10  msec to 0.2  sec .",
    "we did account for the observational selection effect due to finite instrument detectability by implementing the radio pulsar luminosity model of narayan & ostriker  1990 ( eqs .",
    "23 , 24 in g02 ) , and a lower detectable pulsar luminosity limit of @xmath87  mjy@xmath88kpc@xmath89 .",
    "finally , we assumed that there is no magnetic field or misalignment angle evolution with time . in an effort to simplify the approach we did not consider the multitude of selection effects and individual survey detectability limits .",
    "we also did not calculate the distance to individual pulsars after tracking them in the galactic potential as in g02 and g04 , relying on the luminosity distribution function .",
    "we believe , however , that the gross effects of the new spindown law ( [ pdot ] ) can be understood even with our procedure .",
    "our results are shown in figs .",
    "2,3 & 5 . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the result of our simulation for the standard dipolar spindown ( @xmath52 , or equivalently @xmath51 , and no dependence on misalignment angle @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath90 for all pulsars ) .",
    "one can directly see a strong concentration of pulsars near the death line , although the concentration is decreased by the luminosity selection effect , which favors younger brighter pulsars and fills up the upper left corner of the diagram .",
    "this concentration is understood since pulsars evolve slower and slower as they grow older .",
    "this is , however , not what is observed ( figure  4 ) .",
    "the need to make the death line boundary softer led some researchers to introduce a `` death valley '' ( g02 ) or field decay ( g02 , g04 ) in their simulations . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show that introducing the @xmath29 dependence that we have obtained in eq .",

    "as we saw in figure  [ fig1 ] the angle - dependent death line helps in smoothing the pileup . in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show the present day observed radio pulsar distribution from the atnf pulsar catalog for comparison with our results .",
    "the similarity between figures  [ fig3 ] & [ fig4 ] is quite good considering the simplifications of our model .",
    "we aim to reproduce the gross features of the observed @xmath0 diagram for non - millisecond pulsars  its triangular shape and centroid location , while keeping the number of initial magnetic field components to a minimum . in the standard spindown picture",
    "it is very difficult to have pulsars in the lower corner of the @xmath0 triangle without polluting the low @xmath70 ",
    "low @xmath91 region of the diagram with low - field pulsars , which are not observed . in our spindown model",
    "the lower corner is filled with pulsars dropping from the higher @xmath91 ( higher @xmath16 ) region , rather than the ones moving on straight tracks as in the standard case .",
    "this contributes to the triangular shape of the diagram .",
    "we obtain a better overall fit if we constrain the misalignment angles to be smaller than @xmath92 ( figure [ fig41 ] ) .",
    "this reduces the horizontal width of the triangle , which means that more higher - field pulsars are moving on vertical tracks in the diagram . also , the ridge of overdensity near the theoretical death line seen in figure  [ fig3 ] is smoothed out in figure  [ fig41 ] .    similar shapes of the diagram are found for @xmath93 .",
    "this explains individual observed pulsars with @xmath1 .",
    "however , our fit deteriorates for values of @xmath94 larger than 0.25 .",
    "we thus conclude that , although individual pulsars may well have @xmath93 , as a whole , @xmath95 is a good approximation for the observed pulsar population .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath52 , from eqs .",

    "the pulsar population at the end of the simulation , however , shows a different distribution of misalignment angles as shown by the thick solid line .",
    "the selection bias towards smaller misalignment angles may be attributed to the fact that orthogonal rotators spin down faster ( on the average ) , and therefore are more likely to evolve beyond the death line within the observation time interval .",

    "poloidal electric currents will be generated as long as electric charges can be produced in the magnetosphere .",
    "these charges are produced in the magnetospheric polar gaps . in the axisymmetric case",

    "in the rotating frame of the star , however , open field lines rotate at their own rate @xmath104 opposite to the direction of stellar rotation around the magnetic axis .",
    "observational evidence for this effect can be found in the well known sub - pulse drift phenomenon ( e.g. beskin 1997 ; rankin & wright 2003 ) . in the limit @xmath105 , it is as if open magnetic field lines are anchored on the stellar surface . in the opposite limit @xmath106 ,",
    "open field lines rotate around both the magnetic and rotation axes returning to the same position every rotation of the star when viewed by an inertial observer . for finite @xmath107 a phase shift about the magnetic axis",
    "will be accumulated after every turn of the star .",
    "a simple analogy to the above picture might be that of a lawn watering system consisting of a hose rotating at angular velocity @xmath6 , and a sprinkler at its end rotating with angular velocity @xmath108 in the rotating frame of the watering hose .",
    "note that the orthogonal component does not require the establishment of a poloidal electric current circuit in order for it to slow down the stellar rotation .",
    "the orthogonal component emits spiral electromagnetic waves ( in general alfven waves ) which travel out to infinity through the rotating or non - rotating open field lines .",
    "the main conclusions of the present work are :    1 .",
    "the electromagnetic energy loss of a pulsar depends not only on the surface magnetic field @xmath16 and on the rotational angular velocity @xmath6 , but also on the misalignment angle @xmath29 and on the angular velocity of the open magnetic field lines @xmath12 ( which is in general smaller than @xmath6 ) .",
    "the approach to pulsar death modifies the rate of energy loss .",
    "the death occurs when the pulsar slows down sufficiently so that the angular velocity of the open fieldlines @xmath106 .",
    "3 .   the energy loss close to the pulsar death is smaller than what is given by the standard dipolar spindown formula .",
    "this effect gives a good fit between the theoretical and observed distributions of pulsars near the death line , without invoking a magnetic field decay .",
    "4 .   our model may also account for individual pulsars spinning down with braking index @xmath1 .",
    "however , @xmath2 remains a good approximation for the pulsar population as a whole .",
    "pulsars near the death line have braking index values @xmath3 .",
    "such high braking index values may be observable .",
    "pulsars near the death line may have preferentially smaller inclination angles .",
    "a preliminary look at the atnf pulsar catalog data suggests that the last point may have some observational support .",
    "one possible measure of the inclination angle of a pulsar is its fractional pulse width , or the ratio of the width of the pulse to the period of the pulsar .",
    "if the radio beam size is independent of inclination , then we would expect pulsars with smaller inclinations to be seen for a larger fraction of the period than pulsars with large inclinations . in order to test this hypothesis we took the available data for the pulse width at 50@xmath109 of the pulse peak from the atnf catalog ( 1375 pulsars with @xmath110 ) . in order to be able to compare the fractional pulse width for pulsars of different periods",
    ", we have to correct for the intrinsic size of the pulsar beam .",
    "if the beam roughly follows the angular size of the open fieldlines , then the beam size falls as @xmath111 with increasing period ( we are assuming that the last closed field line extends out to the light cylinder ) . therefore , the quantity that should relate to the degree of alignment is @xmath112 , where @xmath102 is the measured pulse width . in figure  [ fig51 ]",
    "we plot the observed pulsars as circles with the radius of the circle linearly proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "a visual inspection of the plot shows that there is an excess of larger pulse fractions for older pulsars , and in particular for pulsars near the right edge of the @xmath0 triangle .",
    "this region is near the pulsar death line ( dashed line ) , and therefore , this feature is particularly interesting .",
    "obviously , a much better analysis needs to be performed , but these results are quite encouraging .",
    "an overabandunce of pulsars with large pulse fractions near the death line in a smaller pulsar sample had also been interpreted by lyne and manchester ( 1988 ) as an indication of alignment .    in an effort to simplify the fits we have assumed in this paper that the misalignment angle stays the same during the evolution , and there is no field decay .",
    "the reality may of course be more complicated , and there could be some amount of field decay , and potential alignment ( and consequent precession ) during the lifetime of a pulsar , due to electromagnetic torques on the star .",
    "these effects would introduce extra degrees of freedom to fitting the pulsar distribution .",
    "we hope , however , that the physically motivated spindown law of the type introduced in this work would find its way into detailed population synthesis models .",

    "<S> we address the issue of electromagnetic pulsar spindown by combining our experience from the two limiting idealized cases which have been studied in great extent in the past : that of an aligned rotator where ideal mhd conditions apply , and that of a misaligned rotator in vacuum </S>",
    "<S> . we construct a spindown formula that takes into account the misalignment of the magnetic and rotation axes , and the magnetospheric particle acceleration gaps . </S>",
    "<S> we show that near the death line aligned rotators spin down much slower than orthogonal ones . in order to test this approach </S>",
    "<S> , we use a simple monte carlo method to simulate the evolution of pulsars and find a good fit to the observed pulsar distribution in the @xmath0 diagram without invoking magnetic field decay . </S>",
    "<S> our model may also account for individual pulsars spinning down with braking index @xmath1 , by allowing the corotating part of the magnetosphere to end inside the light cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the role of magnetic reconnection in determining the pulsar braking index . </S>",
    "<S> we show , however , that @xmath2 remains a good approximation for the pulsar population as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we predict that pulsars near the death line have braking index values @xmath3 , and that the older pulsar population has preferentially smaller magnetic inclination angles . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible signatures of such alignment in the existing pulsar data . </S>"
