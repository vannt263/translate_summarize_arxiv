    "<S> we employ qcd sum rules to calculate the @xmath0 form factors and coupling constant by studying the three - point @xmath1 correlation function . </S>",

    "<S> we get a value for the coupling which is in agreement with estimates based on constituent quark model .    </S>",
    "<S> hadrons are composites of the underlying quarks whose effective fields describe point - like physics only when all the interacting particles are on mass - shell . when at least one of the particles in a vertex is off - shell , the finite size effects of the hadrons become important . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the knowledge of the form factors in hadronic vertices is of crucial importance to estimate any hadronic amplitude using hadronic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> this work is devoted to the study of the @xmath1 form factor , which is important , for instance , in the evaluation of the dissociation cross section of @xmath2 by pions and @xmath3 mesons using effective lagrangians @xcite . since a decrease of @xmath2 production in heavy ions collisions might signal the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , a precise evaluation of the background , i.e. , conventional @xmath2 absorption by co - moving pions and @xmath3 mesons , is of fundamental importance .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 coupling has been studied by some authors using different approaches : vector meson dominance model plus relativistic potential model @xcite and constituent quark meson model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the numerical results from these calculations may differ by almost a factor two . </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of this difference can not be underestimated since the cross section is proportional to the square of the coupling constants . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the use of different coupling constants and form factors can lead to cross sections that differ by more than one order of magnitude , and that can even have a different behavior as a function of @xmath4 .    in previous works </S>",

    "<S> the continuum thresholds for the sum rules are @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> we first discuss the @xmath0 form factor with an off - shell @xmath15 meson . in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> in order to do this extrapolation we fit the qcdsr results with an analytical expression . </S>",
    "<S> we tried to fit our results with a mono - pole form , since this is very often used for form factors , but the fit was only good for @xmath80 . for @xmath74 and @xmath75 </S>",

    "<S> considering the uncertainties in the continuum threshold , and the difference in the values of the coupling constants extracted when the @xmath15 , @xmath14 or @xmath2 mesons are off - shell , our result for the @xmath0 coupling constant is :    g_dd^*=(3.48 0.76)^-1 . </S>",

    "<S> to summarize : we have used the method of qcd sum rules to compute form factors and coupling constant in the @xmath83 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the coupling show once more that this method is robust , yielding numbers which are approximately the same regardless of which particle we choose to be off - shell and depending weakly on the choice of the continuum threshold . as for the form factors , </S>",
