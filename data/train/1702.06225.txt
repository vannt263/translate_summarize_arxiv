    "partial atomic charges ( pacs ) , i.e. point charges placed on the nuclei position of a molecule are often used in large - scale molecular mechanics calculations to replace the detailed quantum mechanical charge distributions . @xcite the model is extremely useful since the electrostatic forces acting between molecules are then expressed as a sum of pairwise interactions , enabling a straightforward computation , especially as molecules jiggle around and rotate quite a lot during the course of the simulation .",
    "the question of just how to determine pacs is critical of course .",
    "the most important constraint is the exact reproduction of the low - order electrostatic moments ( esm ) , the monopole @xmath0 , the dipole @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and the quadrupole moment @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the charge distribution within the molecule .",
    "moments determine the far - field potential produced by the molecule , @xmath5 and they also control the electrostatic interaction energy @xmath6 of the molecule ( and through it the forces exerted on it ) with a weakly non - constant potential @xmath7 resulting from the other molecules or distant charged sources@xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( estimated at a central point within the molecule ) etc .. this pivotal dual role of esms is what drives the requirement that the charge distribution of the pacs reproduce exactly the molecular esms ( mol - esms ) .",
    "an efficient elegant method for achieving this in as many as possible moments has been developed @xcite but these charges were shown to become numerically ill - defined in large molecules.@xcite    the pacs ( top panels ) and the esp correlation ( bottom panels ) for the methyl - acetate molecule , using standard population analysis methods ( left panels ) and other pac methods ( right panels ) . the mean absolute relative deviation ( mard ) of eq .",
    "[ eq : mard ] appears in parenthesis near each pac method . ]",
    "another source of pacs is the quantum mechanical population analysis techniques , such as the mulliken ( mpa),@xcite , loewdin ( lpa),@xcite , hirshfeld ( hpa)@xcite , and natural population ( npa)@xcite analyses .",
    "these methods have the merit that they reflect not just the charge distribution but also selected aspects of the quantum mechanical wave function . in fig .",
    "[ fig : methylacetate ] ( top left ) we show as histograms the pacs of these methods applied to the methyl acetate molecule .",
    "it is seen that different methods produce different sets of pacs , and even the sign of pac is variable .",
    "for example the lpa gives positive charges on oxygens , which seems awkward given the high electronegativity of the oxygen atom relative to carbon and hydrogen atoms .",
    "it is also seen that standard pas do not reproduce the mol - esps so well , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : methylacetate ] ( bottom left ) . in this figure ,",
    "called a esp correlation plot , we plot pac - esps , @xmath11 vs. the mol - esp @xmath12 calculated from the qm density ( eq .  [ eq : qmpot ] ) with @xmath13 being points of a real - space grid of spacing @xmath14 .",
    "the thin red line in the plot corresponds to the perfectly correlated condition @xmath15 . in order to quantify the quality of @xmath16 we define the mean absolute relative deviation ( mard ) from @xmath12",
    "as @xmath17 where an average is taken over all grid - points @xmath13 for which : 1 ) @xmath13 is `` outside of the molecule '' , i.e. its distance from any nucleus @xmath18 is larger than the atomic van - der - waals radius @xmath19 @xcite ) and 2 ) @xmath13 is not too far from the molecule , so that its potential @xmath12 is not smaller than the threshold value of @xmath20",
    ". can not become singular due to this requirement . ]",
    "pacs obtained by `` standard '' pas have large mards : ranging from 0.37 for hpa up to a whopping 1.76 for npa . on the right panel of the figure",
    "we show data concerning the same molecule , but using the iterated - hirshfeld method ( ihpa),@xcite the cm5 method @xcite , which is a parameterized database correction to hpa charges and the chelpg method ( here representing a suit of similar methods @xcite ) which select the pacs so as to best fit the _ ab initio _ esp .",
    "these three methods yield much improved description of the esp with mard going from 0.3 for ihpa and cm5 down to 0.08 for chelpg .",
    "chelpg , despite the close fit to esp , suffers from deficiencies : the pacs do not respect the point symmetry and they fluctuate when the molecule rotates or translates with respect to the real space grid used to perform the fit .",
    "furthermore , in larger molecules the pacs of atoms distant from the molecular surface can become unwieldy large .",
    "both of these issues are discussed in the literature@xcite therefore , ihpa and cm5 are often considered preferred approaches for pacs , although as seen in the figure , both methods leave ample room for improvement . note that the ihpa charges for this molecule are close to the chelpg pacs .    here",
    ", we study a new idea : take pacs which are as close as possible to a reference set , for example the mpa , hpa or ihpa pacs , but insist that they reproduce exactly the components of the lowest esm tensors ( dipole and quadrupole ) characterizing the molecular charge distribution .",
    "we formulate a straightforward method to determine such `` minimally corrected pacs '' ( section  [ sec : method ] ) and then benchmark the results using a subset of molecules taken from the database of ref .",
    "@xcite ( section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "final conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : summary - and - conclusions ] .",
    "consider a molecule having @xmath21 nuclei at given cartesian positions @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , for which a qm calculation has determined the charge density @xmath24 of the molecule and from it , low order moments the charge @xmath25 , the dipole @xmath26 and the symmetric traceless quadrupole moment tensor @xmath27 .",
    "note that below , we use the notation @xmath28 for the diagonal elements of @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath2 and @xmath31 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath32 .",
    "for any set of pacs @xmath33 multipoles can be defined , as : the monopole ( total charge ) @xmath34 , the dipole @xmath35 and the quadrupole @xmath36 , ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "given a set of reference pacs @xmath38 we seek to determine a `` minimally - corrected '' set of pacs @xmath39 such that that the size of the correction @xmath40 is _ minimal _ but the multipoles are equal to the qm determined multipoles , i.e. the following constraints are satisfied : @xmath41 note that the number of constraints ( denoted @xmath42 ) in eq .",
    "is @xmath43 and not @xmath44 since the electric quadrupole tensor is symmetric and traceless .",
    "point symmetries can reduce this number of constraints further .",
    "if , for example , both positive and negative charge densities are symmetric against the reflection through a plane ( the x - y plane , for example ) then there are 3 constraint less ( one from the z component of the dipole and and 2 from xz and yz components of the quadrupole , which are zero by symmetry ) .",
    "only when the number of atoms @xmath21 in the molecule is greater than the number of constraints @xmath42 can we hope to reproduce the constraints exactly .",
    "we therefore demand that @xmath45 and use the @xmath46 additional `` degrees of freedom '' to minimize the deviance @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath48 we avoid the quadrupole moment constraint and use only the dipole moment constraint .",
    "we are led to consider the lagrangian @xmath49 as a function of the @xmath21 @xmath50 and the ten lagrange multipliers : one @xmath51 three @xmath52 s , three diagonal @xmath53 and three off - diagonal@xmath54 where @xmath2 and @xmath31 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath32 .",
    "taking derivatives with respect to these variables and equating to zero leads to the following set of @xmath55 linear equations in @xmath55 unknowns , given here in block - matrix / vector form :    @xmath56    with the @xmath57 matrix @xmath58 equaling the following form :     @xmath59 which depends _ only _ on the location of the atomic nuclei , is composed of blocks : the @xmath60 block is a @xmath61 unit matrix , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are matrices of dimension @xmath65 ( @xmath66 columns each of length @xmath21 ) of matrix elements : @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath23 and @xmath2 and and @xmath69 ( where the ordered set @xmath70 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath71 ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are respectively the transposed matrices . the @xmath75 column - vector on the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "[ eq : ax=00003db ] includes the unknowns , the @xmath21 partial charges @xmath76 and the @xmath77 , the ten lagrange multipliers for the ten constraints .",
    "the @xmath78 column - vector on the right - hand - side has @xmath21 values of the reference charges @xmath79 , followed by the total charge on the molecule @xmath25 , then the three values of the qm dipole moment @xmath26 followed by the three values of the diagonal elements of the given qm quadrupole tensor @xmath80 and finally the qm values of the three off - diagonal elements @xmath81 where @xmath2 and @xmath31 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath32 ) .",
    "a similar equation holds for the mcd method , where the six last rows are erased from @xmath58 and from the column vectors and the six right columns are erased from @xmath58 as well .",
    "this leaves us with a @xmath82 system of equations .",
    "we use the singular value decomposition ( svd ) to find the pseudo - inverse @xcite of the structural matrix @xmath58 of eq .",
    "[ eq : ax=00003db ] anticipating it might be near singular . the matrix may even become singular at special atomic geometries .",
    "such a singularity will be `` smoothed '' by the svd procedure but sharp change in the charges will be seen .",
    "we make sure that the obtained solution indeed solves the problem to near computer accuracy .",
    "next , we examine the values of the lagrange multipliers @xmath51@xmath52 and @xmath83 , which are formally equal to the derivatives of the minimal value of @xmath84 with respect to the constraint value ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) .",
    "when such a lagrange multiplier is very large , it signals a possible numerical problem . for example , if @xmath85 is near ( or greater than ) 1 , where @xmath86 is the precision with which @xmath87 is given , then the solution is probably dominated by the imprecision and is thus of no value for our purpose . in order to avoid this problem",
    ", we eliminate the `` offending '' constraints from the matrix equation ( the corresponding row and column in the matrix and the entry in the column vectors ) .",
    "the reduced equation is then solved and the remaining lagrange multipliers are examined again .",
    "we repeat such elimination until all lagrange multipliers have proper magnitudes .",
    "this pruning procedure helps avoid cases where small inaccuracies of the input data dominate the final result .",
    "only a small number of molecules we have tested exhibited such a sensitivity .",
    "when symmetry is active , it reduces the number of independent @xmath88 s ( called number of degrees of freedom ( ndofs ) ) and the number of independent constraints accordingly .",
    "one needs to reduce the number of constraints if it exceeds the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the water molecule has 3 nuclei but due to symmetry the two h nuclei will have the same pac and so ndof=2 .",
    "due to the symmetry only the dipole moment in the direction of the c2 axis is a constraint ( the components perpendicular to the c2 axis are zero by symmetry ) .",
    "together with the charge of water ( 0 ) we already have 2 constraints so one must give up imposing the quadrupole moment for water .",

    "to demonstrate the efficacy of the method we demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : efficacy ] the mpa and ihpa pacs and their esp correlation plots before and after applying the minimal corrections required for imposing dipole and quadrupole moments ( denoted mcd / mcdq - mpa and mcd / mcdq - ihpa respectively ) .",
    "notice that the mpa - esp has low correlation with the mol - esp , as can be evident visually and also by the reported mard of 2 .",
    "the mcd corrections improve the esp but only mcdq corrections show high quality esp ( with mard of 0.05 ) . in accordance with previous reports,@xcite",
    "the ihpa esp already correlates nicely with the mol - esp ( mard of 0.16 ) but the mcdq - ihpa improves the correlation significantly and the mard reduces by a factor of 4 . for his molecule both mcdq - m pa and mcdq - ihpa have similar mards but this is not typical , for most molecules the mcdq - ihpa mards are much smaller than those of mcdq - mpa ( see fig.[fig : hpa - histog ] ) .",
    "the mcdq - mpa pacs are not drastically different from the mpa pacs yet their mards are considerably lower .",
    "this shows the power of the minimally corrected pacs , where a small change in pacs can improve the pac based esp considerably .    in fig , .",
    "[ fig : hpa - histog ] we display a log - scale histogram of mards of several pac - based potentials on selected molecules containing 10 - 18 atoms .",
    "each pac method can be characterized by a pair of numbers ( shown in parenthesis within the legend box ) indicating the median / maximal mard taken over the given set of molecules .",
    "the pacs obtained by minimally correcting the @xmath89 reference ( called pa0 ) are actually the minimal pacs that give the dipole and quadrupole of the molecules .",
    "it is seen that their correlation with the exact esp is considerably higher than that of mpa and hpa , somewhat similar to that of mcdq - mpa and mcdq - hpa , close to that of cm5 .",
    "this goes to show that the fit of just the dipole and quadrupole , keeping the charges as small as possible gives a reasonably behaved esp , although in general , for very large molecules the mcdq - pa0 performance may degrade with size compared to the pa methods .",
    "we see that mpa and hpa have similar mards while ihpa seems to give considerably smaller mards ( by a factor 2 - 3 ) .",
    "the minimal corrected ( mcdq ) to mpa and hpa yield smaller mards by a factor 4 and for ihpa by a factor 2 . altogether",
    "the mcdq significantly improves the esp .",
    "the mcdq - ihpa median mard is 7% is similar to that of chelpg ( 5% ) .    the mard ( eq .  ) of various pacs schemes for a subset of molecule taken from ref .",
    "numbers in parenthesis appearing near the molecule names indicate the number of atoms in that molecule . the pair of numbers ( median / max ) appearing in the legend box near each scheme is , respectively , the median and maximum of the relative deviance taken over the shown set molecules.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in table  [ tab : dq ] we show , for each set of pacs the magnitude of the charge correction @xmath90 . for a given molecule",
    "the mcd correction is largest for pa0 and then for mpa and hpa and it is smallest for ihpa .",
    "mcdq corrections are in general considerably larger than mcd but in both methods @xmath90 decreases as the number of atoms in the molecule grows .",
    "this is due to the fact that in large systems even small charge shifts have a large affect on the dipole and the quadrupole moments .",

    "however , we believe this is an unlikely or quite rare event . ] in [ fig : q_o(phi ) ] we show the mpa , mcdq - mpa and chelpg pacs of the oxygen atom in n - methylethanamide@xcite the as a function of the dihedral angle @xmath93 .",
    "it is seen that as the angle increases from 0 the mcdq - mpa pac slightly decreases and then increase rapidly followed by a rapid yet continuous drop near @xmath94 from a value of @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "an additional very sharp feature is seen near @xmath97 .",

    "we have studied a new scheme for minimally correcting reference pacs so that they reproduce the exact dipole and quadrupole moments of a molecule and we found that such a minimal correction greatly improves the correlation of the pac - esp with respect to the mol - esp . minimally corrected",
    "pacs based on mpa , hpa , ihpa have the benefit that they do not depend on a grid and that they fully respect the point - symmetry and rotational / translational symmetries of the molecule .",
    "furthermore , since the reference pacs are well defined for inner / buried atoms , and due to their `` minimal correction '' feature , the mc - pacs are not expected to become ill - defined for inner atoms of large molecules . when the underlying reference is the ihpa set of pacs the resulting esp is of similar quality to that of the chelpg set of pacs resulting from a best - fit to esps .",
    "the dependence of the pacs on the molecular distortion was demonstrated to have sometimes very sharp features however all the changes were smooth , hence forces can be calculated on the atoms of the molecule .",
