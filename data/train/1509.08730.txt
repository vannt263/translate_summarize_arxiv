    "critical phenomena in gravitational collapse were first reported in the seminal work of chopuik @xcite . shortly after this original discovery , which was based on studies of massless scalar fields in spherical symmetry ,",
    "similar behavior was found in other matter models , including vacuum ( i.e.  pure gravitational waves ) @xcite , and radiation fluids @xcite ( see the excellent reviews @xcite for a much more comprehensive discussion . )    critical collapse can be observed in the evolution of generic initial data close to the threshold of black - hole formation .",
    "we again refer to @xcite for thorough reviews , and briefly summarize only the most important characteristics here .",
    "consider initial data that are parametrized by some parameter @xmath0 , with the evolution of data with @xmath0 greater than some critical parameter @xmath1 leading to black - hole formation .",
    "close to the critical parameter the following critical phenomena can then be observed in the resulting spacetimes . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the mass of the newly formed black holes scales with @xmath3 where the critical exponent @xmath4 depends on the matter model , but not on the specific choice or parametrization of the initial data . in the strong - field region prior to black - hole formation the spacetime approaches a self - similar critical solution , which again depends on the matter model only . for some matter models , including massless scalar fields",
    ", the critical solution features a discrete self - similarity , while others , including perfect fluids , feature a continuous self - similarity .",
    "numerous studies , both numerical and analytical , have followed up on the above initial reports of critical phenomena .",
    "most of this work , however , has focused on spherical symmetry , where the demand for high spatial resolution of increasingly small features can be met most easily . as a consequence , aspects of critical collapse that can be studied only in the absence of spherical symmetry remain largely unexplored , for example the effects of angular momentum ( but see @xcite , as well as @xcite for a summary of results from perturbative calculations . )",
    "another important question remains unresolved : studying linear perturbations of the spherically symmetric critical solution for scalar fields , martn - garca and gundlach @xcite found that all non - spherical perturbations decay , while choptuik _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite found numerical evidence for the existence of an aspherical growing mode .",
    "given the richness of the subject , the number of numerical studies of critical collapse in the absence of spherical symmetry is surprisingly small ( some recent examples of numerical studies of critical collapse in the absence of spherical symmetry include @xcite . ) as gundlach and martn - garca observed in their review @xcite ,  there has been less progress in going beyond spherical symmetry than we anticipated . \"    in the meantime , numerical relativity simulations in three spatial dimensions have made tremendous progress following the first successful simulations of the inspiral of binary black holes @xcite .",
    "while these newly available codes have been used to study many interesting astrophysical processes , they have rarely been applied to studies of critical collapse ( see @xcite for two examples . )",
    "one possible reason is that most of these codes are based either on cartesian coordinates or more complicated coordinate patches , neither one of which are well suited for simulations of the small spatial structures encountered in critical collapse simulations .",
    "presumably , spherical polar coordinates are better suited to study critical phenomena , in particular the behavior of deviations from the spherically symmetric critical solution ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite . )",
    "we have recently developed a numerical code that solves einstein s equations in spherical polar coordinates @xcite , and in this paper we use this code to study the critical collapse of radiation fluids .",
    "the original discovery of critical phenomena in the collapse of a radiation fluid by evans and coleman @xcite was quickly followed by a number of both analytical ( e.g.  @xcite ) and numerical studies ( e.g.  @xcite . ) to the best of our knowledge , however , all of these studies were performed under the assumption of spherical symmetry . here",
    "we generalize some of these results by relaxing this assumption ; in particular we compute scaling laws of the form ( [ scaling ] ) for axisymmetric data .",
    "as first discussed in @xcite , the critical solution encountered in the collapse of radiation fluids features a continuous self - similarity ( css ) , rather than the discrete self - similarity found in many other matter models .",
    "we identify this critical solution in our spherically symmetric numerical solutions , and study the approach to this critical solution in our aspherical simulations .",
    "close to criticality , the aspherical solutions perform a damped oscillation around the spherical critical solution in a manner very similar to that described by gundlach @xcite  at least for the cases that we considered .",
    "we believe that this is the first confirmation of this behavior in a non - linear numerical simulation .",
    "in addition to analyzing critical phenomena in the collapse of a radiation fluid in the absence of spherical symmetry , this paper serves to test and calibrate the performance of a free ( i.e.  unconstrained ) evolution code in the context of critical collapse .",
    "traditionally , most codes used in simulations of critical collapse were specifically designed for that purpose : they made symmetry assumptions , adopted specific slicing conditions ( e.g.  maximal or polar slicing ) and used constrained evolution , in which einstein s constraint equations are used to replace at least some of the evolution equations .",
    "many more recently developed codes used in simulations of binary coalescence , on the other hand , are designed very differently : they do not make any symmetry assumptions and use free evolution , in which the constraint equations can be monitored but are not solved .",
    "in general these codes can be run with different slicing and gauge conditions , but the  1+log \" and  gamma - driver \" conditions ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 1+log ] ) and ( [ gamma - driver ] ) below ) have proven particularly useful for simulations of spacetimes containing black holes .",
    "how suitable these codes are for simulations of critical collapse , however , remains a somewhat open question ( see also @xcite for recent discussions . )",
    "our findings here demonstrate that , at least for some matter models , unconstrained evolution codes with the 1+log and gamma - driver coordinate conditions can indeed be used to study critical phenomena .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : setup ]",
    "we describe the setup of the problem , including a brief description of our numerical methods and the form of our initial data .",
    "we discuss our numerical results in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : ss_centered ] we focus on  centered \" initial data , which take their maximum density at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "these simulations allow us to compare directly with the findings of @xcite . in order to study deviations from spherical symmetry",
    ", however , it also makes sense to study  off - centered \" initial data , which take their maximum away from the origin .",
    "we first consider such data in spherical symmetry in section [ sec : ss_offcenter ] , and then generalize these to axisymmetry in section [ sec : axi ] .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we also include an appendix with some details on the logarithmic radial grid used in this paper .",
    "in the following we construct numerical solutions of einstein s equations @xmath5 for the stress - energy tensor @xmath6 describing a perfect fluid , where we have adopted geometrized units with @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the einstein tensor , @xmath9 is the total energy density , @xmath10 is the pressure , @xmath11 is the fluid four - velocity , and @xmath12 is the spacetime metric . we specialize to a radiation fluid , for which @xmath13 .",
    "we solve einstein s equations ( [ einstein ] ) using the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) formulation @xcite .",
    "the bssn formulation employs a 3 + 1 decomposition of the spacetime , by which the spacetime metric @xmath12 induces a spatial metric @xmath14 on the spatial slices ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a textbook treatment . ) here @xmath15 is the normal on the spatial slice , which , in terms of the lapse function @xmath16 and the shift vector @xmath17 , may be written as @xmath18 ( here and in the following indices @xmath19 denote spacetime indices , while @xmath20 denote spatial indices . )",
    "another important quantity is the extrinsic curvature , which may be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the covariant derivative associated with @xmath23 , as well as its trace @xmath24 .",
    "the formalism also adopts a conformal rescaling of the spatial metric @xmath23 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the conformal factor and @xmath27 the conformally related metric . in the bssn formalism",
    "the conformal factor is usually written as @xmath28 .    in order to implement the bssn formalism in spherical polar coordinates",
    "we also employ a reference - metric approach @xcite .",
    "in such a reference - metric approach , some geometric objects associated with the conformally related metric @xmath27 are expressed in terms of the difference between these objects and their counterparts associated with a reference metric @xmath29 ( see equation ( [ lambda ] ) below for an example ) . for our applications",
    "it is natural to choose @xmath29 to be the flat metric expressed in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "we further scale out appropriate powers of the geometric factors @xmath30 and @xmath31 from all tensorial quantities , so that for regular spacetimes all dynamical variables used in the code remain regular . we do not , however , attempt to regularize the equations , which still contain inverse powers of @xmath30 and @xmath31 and hence become singular at the origin and on the axis .",
    "we adopt a finite - differencing method and evolve the resulting equations with a partially implicit runge - kutta ( pirk ) time integration method @xcite .",
    "details of our numerical implementation can be found in @xcite .    for all simulations reported in this paper we impose",
    " moving puncture \" coordinate conditions , i.e.  the 1+log condition for the lapse function @xmath16 @xmath32 ( see @xcite ) together with a version of a gamma - driver condition @xmath33 with @xmath34 for the shift vector @xmath17 ( see @xcite . ) here the @xmath35 play the role of the conformal connection functions , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the connection symbols associated with the conformally related metric @xmath27 and the flat reference metric @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we solve the fluid equations by applying a similar reference - metric approach to the  valencia \"- form @xcite of the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics ( see also @xcite . ) for the purposes in this paper the equations simplify , since , for a radiation fluid , the rest density @xmath39 vanishes , and the total energy density @xmath9 is given by the internal energy density alone .",
    "we solve the resulting equations using a high - resolution shock - capturing technique as described in @xcite .",
    "while our code was originally designed for three spatial dimensions without any symmetry assumptions , we here specialize to axisymmetric spacetimes , so that our solutions depend on a radius @xmath30 and an angle @xmath40 only .",
    "we also impose equatorial symmetry , so that we can restrict our computations to one hemisphere . one significant enhancement used in this paper",
    "concerns the radial differencing . while we used a uniform grid in all coordinates in the above references ,",
    "we here allow for a logarithmic grid in the radial directions .",
    "we provide more details on both the grid setup and the finite differencing stencils in appendix [ app : log ] .    for the simulations presented in this paper we impose outer boundary conditions at @xmath41 ( in our code units ;",
    "see below ) , and choose each radial grid cell to be larger than its smaller - radius neighbor by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "we also use two different radial grid resolutions . in what we refer to as ",
    "high - resolution `` runs we use @xmath43 , which results in a grid spacing of @xmath44 across the origin ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] ) and a grid spacing at the outer boundary of 0.634 . to put this into perspective ,",
    "an amr application , in which each refinement level has twice the grid resolution of the previous level , would require about 12 nested grid levels to achieve a similar range in grid resolution . in",
    "our ' ' low - resolution \" runs we use @xmath45 , for which @xmath46 , and the grid spacing at the outer boundary is 0.636 .",
    "the structure of our gird is also visible in figs .",
    "[ fig : rho_axi ] and [ fig : omega_profiles ] below .",
    "we start our simulations with initial data that are both conformally flat , i.e.  @xmath47 , and time - symmetric , i.e.  @xmath48 .",
    "we then specify the initial density distribution as follows , @xmath49 where we have abbreviated @xmath50 and where @xmath51 is the second - order legendre polynomial . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath52 parameterizes the overall amplitude of the density , while @xmath53 determines deviations from spherical symmetry . in @xmath54",
    "we have multiplied the ( isotropic ) radius @xmath30 with the square of the conformal factor , @xmath55 , so that , in spherical symmetry , the product can be identified with the areal radius @xmath56 .",
    "the density distribution is then centered on an areal radius of approximately @xmath57 , while its length - scale is approximately @xmath58 . in the following",
    "we will consider different choices for @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath57 , but will always use @xmath59 , which determines our code units . in the following , all dimensional quantities are expressed in units of @xmath58 .",
    "the density distribution ( [ rho_init ] ) depends on the conformal factor , which is found by solving the hamiltonian constraint @xmath60 in practice we iterate between the two equations ( [ rho_init ] ) and ( [ hamiltonian ] ) until convergence has been achieved .    for spherically symmetric and centered data , i.e.  @xmath61",
    ", the density distribution ( [ rho_init ] ) reduces to @xmath62 which is the initial density distribution adopted in @xcite ( see their equation ( 6 ) . ) the total gravitational mass @xmath63 can then be computed analytically , @xmath64 which shows that @xmath65 serves as a non - dimensional measure of the strength of the gravitational fields . in generalizing the density ( [ evanscoleman ] ) to the aspherical distributions ( [ rho_init ] ) we have introduced extra factors that ensure that the density is smooth at the origin .",
    "finally , we initialize the lapse function @xmath16 and the shift vector @xmath17 according to @xmath66",
    ", interpolated to the center at @xmath69 , as a function of time @xmath70 , for spherically symmetric ( @xmath67 ) and centered ( @xmath68 ) initial data .",
    "we include results for two values of the parameter @xmath52 that bracket the critical value @xmath71.,width=336 ]    we start our discussion with spherically symmetric ( @xmath67 ) and centered ( @xmath68 ) data .",
    "as explained above , the initial data ( [ rho_init ] ) then reduce to those of evans and coleman @xcite , but we evolve these data with a completely independent numerical code , and different coordinate conditions . for all simulations shown in this section we used a `` high - resolution '' grid ( see section [ subsec : basics ] for details . )",
    "we perform numerical simulations for numerous different values of @xmath52 and , as expected , find that the simulations result in black - hole formation for sufficiently large values of this parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lapse_centered ] , for example , we show examples for two values of @xmath52 that , at least for the grid set - up used in these simulations , bracket the critical value @xmath71 .",
    "the two values of @xmath52 are so similar that , at early times , the two resulting curves are indistinguishable . at late times",
    ", however , the lapse evolves very differently . in the subcritical case ( @xmath72 )",
    "the lapse returns to approximately unity as the matter is dispersing to infinity , leaving behind flat space , while in the supercritical case ( @xmath73 ) the lapse drops to approximately zero , which is an indication of black - hole formation .",
    "we plot values that are interpolated to the origin at @xmath74 . this fourth - order interpolation using grid points on both sides of the origin leads to spuriously negative values after a black hole has formed , even though the lapse remains positive on all grid points . ]",
    "this bracketing of the critical parameter @xmath71 is in excellent agreement with the findings of @xcite , who reported @xmath75 .",
    "unless the forming black hole is too small in comparison to our grid resolution , we can also detect the newly forming apparent horizon with our apparent horizon finder , and compute an approximate black - hole mass from the proper area of this apparent horizon . for @xmath73",
    ", for example , we found that an apparent horizon forms at a coordinate radius of about 2.94 @xmath76 , meaning that the interior of the black hole is covered by only 11 grid points ( on our `` high - resolution '' grid . ) accordingly , our error in the masses of small black holes is rather large . for larger black holes ,",
    "the apparent horizon grows a little after it first forms , as more matter falls into the black hole , but then settles down to an approximately constant value , which we take as the black hole mass @xmath77 .     for subcritical evolutions ( top panel ) , and",
    "the black hole mass @xmath77 for supercritical evolutions ( bottom panel ) , for spherically symmetric ( @xmath67 ) and centered ( @xmath68 ) data .",
    "the crosses denote our numerical results , while the solid lines represent the fits ( [ mass_scaling ] ) and ( [ rho_scaling ] ) .",
    "the dashed line in the inset shows the gravitational mass ( [ adm_mass]).,width=336 ]    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_centered ] we graph these black hole masses @xmath77 for supercritical evolutions ( @xmath78 ) as a function of @xmath79 . here",
    "we have determined the critical parameter @xmath80 by fitting our numerical values to the scaling law @xmath81 which is included in the figure as a solid line .",
    "this fit also suggests @xmath82 , in good agreement with the value of @xmath83 reported by @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that our black hole masses are smaller than those reported in @xcite by about a factor of three .",
    "our code , including the apparent horizon finder , has passed many tests  for example , we verified that the black - hole mass approaches that of the spacetime s gravitational mass ( [ adm_mass ] ) as @xmath52 is increased ; see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_centered ] . we are not aware of any problems , but we will continue to search for possible causes of this inconsistency . in either case ,",
    "none of our analysis in what follows relies on the masses of the forming black holes .    as pointed out by garfinkle and duncan @xcite , the critical scaling exponent @xmath4",
    "can also be determined from the maximum value of the spacetime curvature attained in subcritical evolutions .",
    "since this curvature is related to the density @xmath9 by einstein s equations ( [ einstein ] ) , we measure the maximum value of the density @xmath9 and , on dimensional grounds , fit to the scaling law @xmath84 our numerical results , together with the fit , are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling_centered ] . using the data included in the plot , this fit results in @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "various sources of error contribute to the uncertainties in our reported values .",
    "one source of error is the truncation error in our finite - difference calculation . to estimate this error we performed simulations for a fixed value of @xmath87 with different resolutions and",
    "conclude that , for our high - resolution grid , the error in the resulting black - hole mass is a fraction of one percent .",
    "closer to the critical point , however , the solution develops smaller spatial features , so that our truncation error is larger ( see also the discussion above . ) fitting to the scaling laws ( [ mass_scaling ] ) and ( [ rho_scaling ] ) introduces additional systematic errors , as they hold strictly only in the immediate neighborhood of the critical point ( see the inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : scaling_centered ] . ) including or excluding data very close to the critical point ( where numerical error will be larger ) or further away from the critical point ( where the scaling laws start to break down ) will change our estimate for the critical exponent by a few percent .",
    "we therefore estimate the error in the critical exponents  at least those derived from the maximum density  to be about 2 or 3% .",
    "this means that our results are in good agreement with those reported by @xcite ( @xmath88 ) as well as the analytical results of @xcite , who found @xmath89 .",
    "we believe that our results for the critical parameter @xmath71 are more accurate ; in section [ sec : ss_offcenter ] below we compare results for both a high - resolution and a low - resolution grid and find agreement to within less than 0.1% .",

    "we also examine the self - similarity of the critical solution . in the strong - field region of the spacetime , close to criticality and prior to black - hole formation , as the spacetime  tries to decide \" whether or not to collapse to a black hole , the solution contracts to a focal point  or rather  focal event \"  in a self - similar fashion ( see fig .  1 in @xcite for an illustration . ) in order to analyze this behavior we first define a variable @xmath96 in spherical symmetry ( for which @xmath97 ) , @xmath56 becomes independent of @xmath40 and may be interpreted as the areal radius .",
