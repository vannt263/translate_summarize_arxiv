    "the accelerating cosmic expansion of the universe , motivated by the mysterious dark energy ( de ) idea , was noticed in 1998 through supernovae experiments @xcite .",
    "a number of various cosmological observations claim that this energy fills the space but yet there is no clue about its identity .",
    "the expansion of the universe started to accelerate when the energy density of matter was overcome by the de .",
    "the evolution of de density is governed by an equation of state parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "this parameter has raised recently many interesting features for accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "some of them are as follows :    * qunitessence region obeys @xmath2 @xcite , * cosmological constant is considered to be the simplest case for de for which @xmath3 , * for phantom phase , the eos parameter follows the domain @xmath4 @xcite . *",
    "qunitum model inherits both of the properties of quintessence and phantom phases by crossing the phantom divide line @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) model @xcite is one of the proposed models to discuss the de dominated phase for accelerating expansion of the universe . it is a single fluid model to unify the de and dark matter .",
    "this model behaves as dark matter when its energy density evolves as @xmath5 in the early times of the universe ( where the scale factor @xmath6 is a function of time ) , whereas the constant energy density behaves as de era in late time acceleration .",
    "thus the mcg model provides unification between dark matter and de @xcite .",
    "the scalar field model is another category to discuss the de scenario .",
    "recently , k - essence @xcite gains an important role to explore the dynamics of the universe .",
    "it inherits a kinetic term which deals with late time inflation and early time acceleration named as k - inflation @xcite .",

    "then @xmath113 crosses the phantom divide line from quintessence to phantom region and becomes constant in the phantom region @xmath114 .",
    "there are two other possibilities of solvable k - essence cosmology @xcite such as :    * general k - essence cosmology : @xmath115 * quintessence k - essence cosmology : @xmath116    these forms yield the same equations ( [ f6 ] ) and ( [ f7 ] ) for @xmath49 and for parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it is mentioned here that the above forms show the same behavior as in the case of purely kinetic k - essence cosmology .",
    "finally , we would like to mention the other class of solvable k - essence models namely integrable k - essence models @xcite .",
    "as an example , let us consider the following so - called e@xmath117-model @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",

    "let the solution of this equation we define as @xmath121 and here we assume that @xmath122 .",
    "then the equation ( 4.1 ) has the following particular solutions ( see @xcite and references therein ) @xmath123 and so on . here",
    "@xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are airy functions .",
    "each of these solutions determine different type of cosmology .",
    "for example , the solution ( 4.4 ) corresponds to the eos : @xmath127 hence we get the eos parameter @xmath128 inserting the value of kinetic term ( 2.15 ) , this equation takes the form @xmath129 if @xmath130 , then @xmath131 .",
    "this shows that the solution ( 4.4 ) represents a universe which is nearly to meet the quintessence phase of the accelerating universe .",
    "similarly , we can calculate the eos and its parameter for the other solutions from the system ( 4.2)-(4.7 ) and as well as for the other integrable k - essence models from @xcite .",
    "finally we note that it is interesting to extend results of this work to the periodical and quasi - periodical gas / fluid models ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) as well as to the knot universe models @xcite .",
    "it has always been interesting to explore models to study the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "this paper is devoted to the study of some solvable k - essence cosmologies using mcg .",
    "in particular , we have discussed the purely kinetic k - essence model by taking the energy density and pressure of mcg model .",
    "we have found a nonlinear differential equation for the energy density which depends upon the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we have constructed eos parameter for different values of @xmath0 by using power law form of potential .",
    "also , the values of constants involved in the model such as , @xmath132 and @xmath57 are constrained in such a way that they give the compatible behavior of our expanding universe with acceleration .",
    "the graphical results can be summarized as follows :    * example @xmath133 is taken as @xmath45 which further leads to two cases . the case @xmath46 gives accelerating expansion of the universe dominated by cosmological constant for @xmath56 , while @xmath58 indicates a universe when de is dominated over the matter to accelerate the universe .",
    "the second case , @xmath47 , indicaress the dynamics of the universe underlying in quintessence phase . *",
    "the second example leads to the generalized chaplygin gas model for @xmath74 . for this value of parameter ,",
    "initially our universe shows quintessence behavior of de dominated era .",
    "after that , it converges to @xmath3 representing cosmological constant . * for @xmath81 and @xmath58 , the eos parameter shows quintessence behavior of the universe . * the case @xmath91",
    ", using k - essence polytropic eos parameter , gives the same dynamics of the universe as discussed for the parameter @xmath81 .",
    "* for @xmath134 leads to a cosmological constant dominated universe for smaller values of @xmath57 whereas the k - essence polytropic eos parameter @xmath113 represents a quintom behavior and becomes constant in the phantom region .",
    "it is concluded that this relationship provides consistent results about accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "we would like to mention here that the same behavior is observed for the general k - essence and quintessence cosmologies as discussed for puerly kinetic k - essence cosmology by using mcg model .",
    "finally , we have given some integrable k - essence cosmologies @xmath135 .",
