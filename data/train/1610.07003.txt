    "the probe of the epoch of reionization ( eor ) remains one of the outstanding aims of modern cosmology . in the past decade ,",
    "intriguing details have emerged about this epoch from a host of cosmological observables .",
    "gunn - peterson ( gp ) tests on spectra of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) ( ( @xcite ) in the redshift range @xmath2 suggest that the universe as making a transition to full reionization during this period . on the other hand , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements ( @xcite , @xcite ) suggest that the universe might have been fully ionized in a redshift range @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "both these observables have their strengths and weaknesses .",
    "the gp test , based on lyman-@xmath4 absorption , is not able to distinguish between a fully neutral medium from the one ionized to one part in a thousand .",
    "cmbr anisotropies , based on photon scattering off free electrons , are sensitive to the integrated thompson scattering optical depth and therefore can not reliably construct the tomography of the reionization epoch .    in the recent past",
    ", major experimental efforts have been undertaken to study the eor in redshifted 21-cm line emission from the epoch .",
    "in particular , many radio interferometers in frequency range @xmath5 are currently operational that specifically aim to detect the eor , for example , low frequency array ( lofar , @xcite ) , 21 centimeter array ( 21cma , @xcite ) , giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt , @xcite ) , donald c. backer precision array for probing the epoch of reionization ( paper , @xcite ) , and the murchison widefield array ( mwa , @xcite ) .",
    "even though the detection of redshifted hi line from the eor remains the most direct and , possibly the most promising , way to delineate the details of the epoch , this method is beset with its own set of issues .",
    "first , unlike cmbr anisotropies , the theoretical modelling of the hi signal from the eor is considerably harder principally owing to uncertainty in the nature of ionizing sources and the details of their formation and evolution .",
    "second , the signal is expected to be weak with brightness temperature @xmath6 .",
    "many hundred hours of observation is needed to detect such a signal with current interferometers , with the attendant complication of maintaining instrumental stability for such long periods .",
    "third , the foreground are expected to be many orders of magnitude larger than the signal ( for details on the three issues see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the use of radio interferometers to estimate the underlying power spectra has been successfully employed for cmb data analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "this method has also been suggested as a possible probe of the intensity correlations of the redshifted hi line , including from the eor ( @xcite ) .",
    "many different approaches have been discussed to detect the hi signal in the presence of dominant foregrounds @xcite .",
    "they are all based on the expectation that foregrounds are smooth in frequency space as they arise from continuum emission , e.g. synchrotron radiation , in both our galaxy and extra - galactic sources . on the other hand",
    "the hi signal has significant structure in the frequency space .",
    "it is conceivable that all these sources , both point and diffuse , can be subtracted from the images , leaving behind the hi signal and gaussian noise , and lofar partly relies upon this technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "another possible method is based on the isolation of foregrounds from the hi signal using power spectrum of the observed signal in conjugate space to the observed frequency ( @xcite ) .",
    "variants of this ` delay space ' ( @xcite ) method are particularly relevant for interferometers such as mwa that have low angular resolution and have been used extensively for the analysis of paper data . in this approach the observed interferometric data  visibilities for each antenna pair as a function of frequency  is fourier transformed along the frequency axis .",
    "the fourier conjugate variable effectively captures signal delay between antenna pairs , which allows one to isolate foregrounds . in the context 3d hi power spectrum",
    "this variable can be related to cosmological distance along line of sight ( for details of this mathematical correspondence see @xcite ) . the ` delay spectrum ' constructed from ` delay space ' approach can be used to recover the cosmological 3d hi power spectrum . in this approach , one deals with visibilities directly , which are primary data products of radio interferometers .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new method based on the delay space approach to extract the power spectrum of the hi signal in the presence of noise and foregrounds .",
    "our method is based on modelling the hi signal taking into account the impact of the @xmath0-term ( arising from non - coplanarity of the array , @xcite ) and the distortion of intensity pattern during a tracking run .",
    "the information from the hi signal is used as weights to cross - correlate the measured visibilities . the proposed method ( `",
    "delay spectrum with imaging arrays ( dsia ) ' ) is a general method applicable for tracking with radio interferometers with wide primary beams and arbitrary array configuration ( e.g. mwa , lofar ) and can also be applied to interferometers with redundant baselines .",
    "we apply the proposed method to analyse 3  hours of mwa data and compare our results with noise and foreground simulations .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the method of visibility correlation using delay space approach in detail .",
    "in particular , this method is applied to the hi signal . in section  3",
    ", we describe the mwa data and the initial analysis of this data based on the publicly - available image processing software : common astronomical software applications ( casa ) . in section  4 the pipeline to extract the hi power spectrum",
    "is discussed . in section  5 , the results from mwa data are discussed and compared with simulations of foregrounds and noise . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our results and indicate possible future directions .    throughout this paper , we have used the planck+wp best fit values of cosmological parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in this section we study the hi signal using visibility correlations in delay space . using our formulation",
    "we derive , in addition to new results , many results already known in the literature .",
    "the main new results are : the impact of @xmath0-term ( subsection  2.1 ) and changing intensity pattern in a tracking run ( subsection  2.2 ) on the hi correlations .",
    "our results are valid for any radio interferometer but our aim here is to underline their applicability to mwa .",
    "the most important inputs from mwa array configuration for our study are : ( a ) the mwa primary beam and ( b ) the bandwidth .",
    "other properties of the mwa array that have a bearing on our analysis are the non - coplanarity of the array and its baseline distribution .    in delay space ,",
    "spectrally smooth foregrounds lend themselves to ready interpretation .",
    "it can be shown that visibilities computed in delay space allow isolation of such foregrounds from the regions dominated by the eor signal and noise ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "this can be achieved by fourier transforming the raw visibilities in frequency space . however , being 3-dimensional and statistical in nature , the properties of the hi signal can only be inferred by correlating the observed visibilities .",
    "our approach , which is based on visibility correlations in delay space , allows us to develop a unified method to deal with both the hi signal and the foregrounds , which are discussed in appendix  [ sec : foregrounds ] .",
    "radio interferometers measure the spatial correlation of the electric fields from the sky , the visibility @xmath13 : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the distance vector between the antennas of the interferometer ( also called baseline vector ) in units of wavelength , @xmath16 denotes the position vector on the sky plane ( which can be be expressed as a pair of direction cosines @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 is the frequency of observation .",

    "we calculate how the hi signal is affected owing to non - zero @xmath0 as compared to @xmath19 case .",

    "as discussed in section  [ sec : powspecest ] , the power spectrum from the data is computed in two stages . first the power spectrum and its rms is computed for a single cell in which the hi signal is expected to be near coherent and then an average is obtained across cells assuming the hi signal to be incoherent for different cells ( figure  [ schem ] ) .    as noted in the text ,",
    "the hi signal can be recovered from a visibility cross - correlation by inverse weighing with @xmath197 .",
    "we denote such a cross correlation : @xmath255 ; @xmath256 is generally a complex number . for optimal averaging to get the lowest noise estimator , one needs to sum over these cross - correlations by inverse weighing with the square of the rms of each cross - correlation @xmath257 . for pure noise , @xmath258 and one can obtain eq .",
    "( [ powspecdef ] ) .",
    "notice that this estimator is invariant under an overall scaling of @xmath257 .",
    "the error on power spectrum for each cell @xmath207 is : @xmath259 , where the average is obtained optimally from the data for all the cross - correlations .",
    "it can be shown that if each cross - correlation is assumed to be uncorrelated , as would be the case for pure noise , @xmath260 .",
    "notice that if the rms for all the cross - correlations is the same , as would be the case if all measurements are equally weighted , then this expression reduces to @xmath261 , where @xmath262 is the number of all the cross - correlations within a cell .      for averaging over cells , we repeat the procedure described above by taking the estimated power spectrum for a cell as the signal and @xmath207 as the weights .",
    "this allows us to estimate 2- and 1-dimensional power spectrum and its rms . for pure noise , the final error on the power spectrum",
    "is expected to approach : @xmath263 , where @xmath196 is the number of cells used for obtaining the average .",
    "we briefly discuss some shortfalls of such a procedure .",
    "first , we do not construct the covariance matrix of the power spectrum estimator .",
    "we only estimate its diagonal terms , @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "this means that we are not able to assess the extent of cross - correlation between two neighbouring bins in figure  [ 1d_power ] .",
    "such cross - correlation might contain important information about systematic errors , foreground leakage , and hi signal and noise cross correlation .",
    "second , we do not include the hi signal in our estimation procedure .",
    "this is justified for the present work as the observed signal is clearly dominated by noise and foreground residuals ( figure  [ 1d_power ] ) .",
    "we briefly assess the impact of the hi signal for computing the error on the power spectrum .",
    "we assume the following estimator for computing the power spectrum for a cell and consider the contribution of only the hi signal : @xmath266 as noted above , this estimator allows us to recover the hi signal .",
    "the subscripts @xmath267 correspond to a pair for visibilities and the sum is carried over all the cross - correlations . after further computation , we obtain the error on the signal : @xmath268\\ ] ] if all the weights are unity this reduces to the usual cosmic variance expression : @xmath269 . even though this term is negligible for our purposes , this would need to be included for longer integration times .",
