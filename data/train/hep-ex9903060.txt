    "supersymmetry ( susy ) assigns to every fermionic sm particle a bosonic superpartner and vice versa  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sm quark helicity states @xmath3 and @xmath4 acquire scalar susy partners @xmath5 and @xmath6 which are also the mass eigenstates for the first two generations to a good approximation .",
    "however , a large mixing can occur in the third generation leading to a large splitting between the mass eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "this can lead to a scalar top quark ( @xmath7 ) which is not only the lightest scalar quark but also lighter than the top quark .    at the tevatron ,",
    "scalar top quark is directly produced in pairs via @xmath8 and @xmath9 fusion diagrams .",
    "the cross section depends only on @xmath1 at leading order  @xcite . the dominant next - to - leading order susy corrections depend on the other scalar quark masses and are small ( @xmath10 ) . for @xmath11= 110 gev@xmath12 , @xmath13 = 7.4 pb in the next - to - leading order . if @xmath14 , @xmath7 can be indirectly produced via the decay @xmath15 .    whenever kinematically allowed , @xmath16 .",
    "if this channel is closed but scalar neutrino ( @xmath17 ) is light , then @xmath18 dominates .",
    "if neither of these channels is allowed , then scalar top decays via a one - loop diagram to charm and a neutralino : @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 is the lightest susy particle and that r - parity is conserved .",
    "hence the @xmath20 is undetected and causes an imbalance of energy .",
    "at cdf , we have performed three separate analyses : ( i ) direct production of @xmath21 with @xmath22 , ( ii ) @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and ( iii ) direct production of @xmath21 with @xmath25 .",

    "we select events with 2 or 3 jets which have @xmath32  gev and @xmath33 and no other jets with @xmath34  gev and @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath27  cut is increased beyond trigger threshold to 40  gev and we require that @xmath27 is neither parallel nor anti - parallel to any of the jets in the event to reduce the contribution from the processes where missing energy comes from jet energy mismeasurement : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
