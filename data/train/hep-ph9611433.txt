    "in two recent papers @xcite it was shown how the cross section for diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons can be predicted in perturbative qcd .",
    "production , i.e. , that the vector meson is composed of a heavy quark and antiquark .",
    "this work used a charmonium model for the meson , rather than treating the meson more generally in terms of the light - cone wave function that the factorization theorem requires . ]",
    "this process provides a novel probe of the dynamics of diffractive scattering in qcd .",
    "one notable prediction is that the cross section is proportional to the square of the gluon density in the hadron .",
    "experimental data @xcite appear to be in accord with the predictions , including an enhancement due to the rapid rise of the gluon density at small @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we extend the factorization theorem to the general case of electroproduction of any meson , and we provide a general proof of the theorem .",
    "the theorem expresses the amplitude for the process in terms of off - diagonal generalizations of the usual parton densities . our demonstration is valid for the whole leading power for the process , in contrast with the calculations in ref .  , which were in a leading - logarithm approximation .",
    "production . in this paper",
    "we treat very generally corrections to all orders . ]",
    "our results will enable the process to be treated with the inclusion of non - leading logarithms .",
    "apart from establishing the factorization theorem for the process , one aim of this paper is to attempt a pedagogical exposition of the methods by which the theorem is derived , since many of the concepts are unfamiliar .",
    "most importantly , the process of constructing a proof led us to new results .",
    "first , the theorem applies to the general case of two - body final states at low transverse momentum in electroproduction at large @xmath0 .",
    "the diffractive case simply corresponds to the small-@xmath1 region , with vacuum quantum number exchange .",
    "so we have extended the theorem to the full range of @xmath1 and to all mesons , pions in particular , not just vector mesons .",
    "in addition we find that we need not only the usual unpolarized parton densities ( generalized to be off - diagonal ) , but also the helicity densities ( @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) and the transversity densities ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) .",
    "since the cross section is proportional to the square of the densities , it is sensitive to the polarized parton densities without needing a polarized proton beam and without needing a measurement of the polarization of the final - state proton .",
    "indeed we can choose which kind of density is probed merely by choosing the final state meson .",
    "the amplitude for longitudinally polarized vector mesons depends only on the unpolarized parton densities .",
    "the amplitude for transversely polarized vector mesons depends only on the transversity densities ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the amplitude for pseudoscalar mesons depends only on the helicity densities .",
    "this result clearly adds to the meager list of processes where the transversity of valence quarks can be probed without the need of some other unknown quantity ( such as an antiquark density or a polarized fragmentation function ) .",
    "all the above statements apply when the incoming virtual photon is longitudinally polarized .",
    "we also prove that the cross section is suppressed by a power of @xmath0 when the photon is transversely polarized .",
    "we give a fairly detailed account of the proof of the factorization theorem .",
    "the style of proof is based on that of refs .  , which treat inclusive hard scattering .",
    "there are some differences .",
    "first , our derivation of the power - counting formula shows some useful improvements . secondly , and rather importantly",
    ", we have to examine more closely exchanges of relatively soft quarks , since , in contrast to the case of inclusive scattering , there can be leading contributions from soft quark exchange ( otherwise known as the endpoint contributions ) .",
    "thus we have to examine the power - counting arguments in more detail .",
    "after this work was substantially complete , radyushkin @xcite published a preprint treating some of the same processes that we consider .",
    "his work appears to be completely compatible with ours ; he takes the same point of view as we do concerning a generalized operator product expansion , although the details of his notation are a little different .",
    "however , he considered only the diffractive limit of small @xmath1 for vector meson production , and hence , just as in ref .",
    ", he did not include the quark contribution .",
    "( the quark operator is presumably unimportant at small @xmath1 . )",
    "he does not present a complete proof of factorization .",
    "ji @xcite and radyushkin @xcite also showed how the same operators appear in an expansion for deeply virtual compton scattering .    in a future paper",
    "we hope to explore further consequences of our results , including detailed calculations .",
    "the process we treat is the diffractive exclusive production of mesons in deep - inelastic electroproduction .",
    "we can express the lepto - production cross section in terms of the cross section for the scattering of virtual photons : @xmath6 the target , of momentum @xmath7 , can be a proton or nucleus ( or any other hadron ) , and the diffracted hadron @xmath8 , of momentum @xmath9 , may or may not have the same flavor quantum numbers as the incoming hadron @xmath10 . the other final - state particle , @xmath11 , can be any possible meson , e.g. , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 . when we treat charge exchange scattering within our framework , the direct connection to the parton densities in the proton @xcite is lost .",
    "we will assume that the meson has quantum numbers such that it can not decay to a gluon pair .",
    "this choice will eliminate certain subprocesses , and covers the mesons of interest .",
    "the process depends on three kinematic variables : the virtual photon s virtuality , @xmath17 , the square of the center - of - mass energy , @xmath18 ( for the photon - proton system ) , and the momentum transfer squared , @xmath19 .",
    "the region we consider is where @xmath20 , while @xmath21 is small , of order @xmath22 .",
    "we also assume that the meson mass obeys @xmath23 .",
    "we are thus treating the asymptotics as @xmath0 gets large .",
    "the bjorken variable is @xmath24 ( where the target mass is neglected ) . in refs .",
    "the diffractive case @xmath25 was treated .",
    "our considerations will apply to large @xmath1 as well .",
    "we will mostly restrict our attention to the case that the virtual photon is longitudinally polarized . the cross section with",
    "transversely polarized photons is somewhat smaller  this was a prediction of refs .  , and is confirmed experimentally , although the suppression is not as much as one might expect .",
    "indeed , we find we can derive a simple factorization theorem only for longitudinally polarized photons , since then the contributions from the endpoints @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the meson wave function are power suppressed , given that the meson wave function at its endpoints behaves approximately as @xmath28 . for transverse polarization , this suppression does not happen , and a more complicated theorem is needed  see sec .",
    "[ sec : transverse ] . at high enough @xmath0",
    ", there is a sudakov suppression , but the physics of this goes beyond the simple factorization theorem , just as in the analogous case of the electromagnetic form factor of the proton @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to use light - front coordinates defined with respect to the collision axis : @xmath29 , with @xmath30",
    ". then we can write @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is the momentum of the meson . in these equations ,",
    "we have neglected small terms in the longitudinal components , of relative size @xmath33 .",

    "labels : @xmath37 , and similarly for @xmath38 .",
    "the theorem we will prove is that the amplitude for the process eq .",
    "( [ process ] ) is @xcite @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is just like the distribution function for partons of type @xmath41 in hadron @xmath10 , except that it is a non - forward matrix element . in fact",

    "the final - state proton in eq .",

    "then the exchanged object no longer has to have vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "the index @xmath41 in the factorization theorem is then to be replaced by a pair of indices for the flavors of the two quark lines joining the parton density @xmath40 to the hard scattering .",
    "similarly , the two quark lines entering the meson may be different , and the index @xmath42 is to be replaced by a pair of indices . ] we will give the definition later . the factor @xmath43 is the light - cone wave function for the meson , and @xmath44 is the hard scattering function .",
    "the sums are over the parton types @xmath41 and @xmath42 that connect the hard scattering to the distribution function and to the meson . since the meson has non - zero flavor , the parton @xmath42 is restricted to be a quark . the factorization theorem eq .",
    "( [ factorization ] ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fact ] .",
    "the above formula is correct for the production of longitudinally polarized vector mesons . for the production of transversely polarized vector mesons or of pseudo - scalar mesons",
    ", we have a formula of exactly the same structure , but in which the unpolarized parton density is replaced by a polarized parton density ( the transversity density for transverse vector mesons , and the helicity density for pseudo - scalar mesons ) .",

    "so in fact we can neglect @xmath84 as well as @xmath81 in the collinear propagator .    in general",
    ", we will have several soft momenta @xmath67 entering the @xmath52 subgraph , and to use the above proof , we must ensure that none of the collinear propagators give obstructions to the contour deformations for each @xmath88 .",
    "in other words , all the poles must be on one side of the real axis for each @xmath88 . to prove this @xcite , we note that all the collinear - to-@xmath52 lines go forward from the hard scattering , but not backward  compare the reduced graphs in fig .",

    "] @xmath89 this gets us much closer to the desired factorization .",
    "it is exactly a kind of operator product expansion , since the @xmath90 factor is a matrix element of a light - cone operator , apart from the consequences of subtractions .",
    "in fact , the subtractions needed to define @xmath90 are associated with regions with larger singular surfaces , and thus in fact to ultra - violet divergences associated with the operator vertices .",
    "that is , the subtractions are just an implementation of the ultra - violet counterterms needed to define renormalized operators .",
    "we therefore write eq .",
    "( [ factored.1 ] ) as @xmath91 where the @xmath92 are the matrix elements of renormalized light - cone operators , and we will call the @xmath93 s coefficient functions .",
    "we use @xmath41 to label the different possible operators .",
    "but there are many possible operators , even when we restrict ourselves to the leading power .",
    "each case of the graphs of fig.[fig : leading.regions ] with a different set of external lines for the @xmath64 graph corresponds to a different operator .",
    "but now we can appeal to the new results by collins @xcite .",
    "these show that we can restrict the sum to gauge invariant operators .",
    "such operators consist of gauge covariant operators ( like @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) joined by path - ordered exponentials ( often called `` string operators '' ) .",
    "we must now determine which of these operators is needed to give a leading power .",
    "first , we construct a modified version of the decomposition of gluons into scalar and transverse polarizations .",
    "consider one particular external gluon , of momentum @xmath76 , that attaches @xmath90 to @xmath96 .",
    "we have a factor @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the numerator of the gluon propagator .",
    "recall , from sec.[sec : powers ] , that the largest term in the sum over the vector indices is the one with @xmath99 and @xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath101 .",
    "this happens because the collinear subgraphs are highly boosted in the breit frame and after the boosts the @xmath101 term is the one with the largest components .",
    "the arguments apply both to the connection of collinear - to-@xmath51 lines to the hard subgraph @xmath47 and of soft lines to the collinear - to-@xmath52 subgraph @xmath52 , i.e. , to all the gluons connecting @xmath90 to @xmath96 .    from the point of view of the @xmath96 factor ,",
    "the gluon @xmath76 is an on - shell massless gluon with a polarization vector proportional to @xmath102 , and a momentum in the @xmath35 direction : @xmath103 .",
    "the big term in @xmath104 therefore corresponds to a polarization exactly proportional to the momentum of the gluon .",

    "@xmath105 to make a covariant formula , we used the previous definitions that @xmath106 and @xmath107 are vectors purely in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions .",
    "the first term on the right - hand - side of this equation we label as corresponding to scalar polarization , and the second term as corresponding to transverse polarization .",
    "since the scalar polarization is exactly proportional to the approximated momentum @xmath108 used in @xmath96 , it gives a factor @xmath109 .",
    "this is precisely the kind of situation in which ward identities simplify the sum over all graphs .",
    "the indirect methods of ref .   give a very efficient implementation of the relevant identities .    with the modified definitions ,",
    "it is still true that there is no penalty for attaching a scalar gluon to @xmath96 , but that there is a penalty for every transverse gluon line and every quark line .",
    "now , the factors for the external lines of @xmath90 correspond to the feynman rules for light - cone operators .",
    "so scalar gluons are associated with factors of @xmath110 in an operator , where @xmath110 is the @xmath35 component of the gluon field . the gauge invariant gluon operator with the lowest number of transverse gluons is of the form @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a path - ordered exponential of the gluon field .",
    "the indices @xmath41 and @xmath42 label transverse components .",

    "the hard part is proportional to @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the polarizations of the gluon and photon , and the gluon index @xmath41 is purely transverse .",
    "the tensor @xmath130 is obtained from the diagrams with a trace with @xmath117 .",

    "it is therefore zero when @xmath131 or @xmath132 , and therefore we get a zero when the photon is longitudinally polarized .",
    "the proofs we have made previously are appropriate for the leading power of @xmath0 , so the zero corresponds to a suppression by another power of @xmath0 .",
    "recall that we have already proved that at least one of the gluons joining @xmath79 to @xmath52 must be transverse , and that results in a suppression compared with the @xmath133 given by the power - counting formula .",

    "we have now proved that the endpoint contributions are power - suppressed , in the case that the photon has longitudinal polarization .",

    "in particular , the biggest will be those for the @xmath212 and @xmath213 quarks , and the @xmath212 density in a proton will be rather bigger than density of @xmath213 quarks .",
    "so the production of the @xmath210 and @xmath14 mesons will be suppressed compared with the values at small @xmath1 .",

    "then the cross section is proportional to @xmath218 , since the lowest - order hard scattering amplitude depends on quark flavor only through a factor of the quark charge .",
    "notice that there is interference in the amplitude between the terms with different flavors of quark , and we have destructive interference for the singlet @xmath13 .",

    "this may be relevant for the significantly smaller @xmath226 ratio that is observed at the new muon collaboration ( nmc ) compared to the desy collider hera at similar @xmath209 .",
    "the production of transversely polarized vector mesons involves the quark transversity density @xmath5 ( or @xmath4 ) .",
    "normally one would imagine that at small @xmath1 , such parton densities are a power of @xmath1 smaller than the regular , unpolarized parton densities , and in particular than the gluon density .",
    "this is because the transversity density involves a helicity flip .",
    "it is usually expected that this requires exchange of non - vacuum quantum numbers , whereas small @xmath1 physics is dominated by something like pomeron exchange .",
    "thus the ratio of transversely polarized vector mesons to longitudinally polarized vector mesons should be small at small @xmath1 , and go to zero at @xmath227 .",
    "thus we are unable to explain the reported ratio from zeus : @xmath228@xcite , since the zeus data are at small @xmath1 , around @xmath229 .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath209 of the data is small enough that there is significant production by transversely polarized _",

    "but in our process , one of the protons in the matrix element is in the final - state . to get the cross section we square the matrix element and sum over all spin states for the outgoing proton .",
    "thus the off - diagonal nature of the matrix element is compatible with an unpolarized cross section ( as regards the proton ) .",
    "exclusive pion production involves the helicity parton densities .",
    "so it should not be suppressed at large @xmath1 compared to vector meson production .",
    "but it should be much smaller at small @xmath1 .",

    "an important consequence is that higher - order corrections can be systematically calculated in powers of @xmath237 .",

    "in addition , we have shown that the theorem applies separately to the case of production of transversely polarized vector mesons . in that case",
    "we probe the @xmath4 or transversity distribution .",
    "although we expect this case to be suppressed at small @xmath1 , we see no reason for a suppression at large @xmath1 .",
    "this process then provides an interesting new method to measure @xmath4 , admittedly the off - diagonal version .",
    "an important consideration is that it is not necessary to have any polarization information about the proton , unlike the situation when one measures @xmath4 in inclusive scattering .",
    "the proof applies only to the case of that the virtual photon that induces the scattering has longitudinal polarization .",
    "the treatment of the same process with transversely polarized photons appears to be a much harder problem in qcd , with a definite power suppression .",
    "an important question that needs further study is to understand how much predictive power there is in the theorem .",
    "as always with perturbative qcd , the problem is that physical quantities are represented in terms of parton densities etc which we are unable to calculated perturbatively . if we had predictions for the non - perturbative quantities , we would have complete predictions for the cross - sections .",
    "but at the present state of the art , we only have models for the non - perturbative quantities , and very little that can be regarded as qcd predictions from first principles . only for the perturbative quantities , the hard scattering and the evolution kernels ,",
    "do we possess a systematic method of calculation within qcd .",
    "now , for ordinary inclusive processes , we able to measure the parton densities from a limited set of processes at one energy and then predict many other processes at all energies that allow the hard scattering to be perturbative .",
    "the reason that this is straightforward is that the parton densities are functions of just one longitudinal variable , and that the deep - inelastic structure functions depend on a corresponding variable , @xmath1 . indeed , with the lowest order hard scattering , the structure functions are just simple linear combinations of parton densities .",
    "obvious generalizations of these remarks apply to other processes , in hadron - hadron scattering , for example .",
    "an immediate consequence is that it is possible to make many real predictions from qcd for inclusive hard scattering .",
    "( of course , practical limitations arise from uncalculated higher order corrections and from substantial experimental errors . )",
    "but the situation is totally different for our process of elastic meson production .",
    "the cross section is function of one momentum - fraction variable , but we have total of three such variables in the factorization formula .",
    "it is not so obvious that we can measure the non - perturbative quantities , even in principle .    at small @xmath1 ,",
    "the situation is better , since the parton densities are dominated by exchange of vacuum quantum numbers : we have a normal regge limit .",
    "to the extent that there are universal regge trajectories , we get a relation between the power laws for the @xmath1 dependence in our process and in ordinary deep - inelastic scattering . since there is an integral over a longitudinal momentum fraction there need not be an exact relation between the off - diagonal parton densities and the diagonal ones probed in ordinary deep - inelastic scattering . thus we may not be able to get precise quantitative information on the diagonal gluon density , particularly as regards the normalization .",
    "our hope is that by some kind of regge factorization we could say that the two parton densities differ by some kind of regge vertex , and that since this regge vertex would be probed at large virtuality , we might be able to calculate it .    in the leading @xmath239 approximation ,",
    "the leading non - diagonal terms are in fact computable in terms of the diagonal parton densities ( in the limit @xmath240 ) .",
    "similarly , after evolution in @xmath209 , the non - diagonal terms come dominantly from the calculated evolution kernel , rather than from the non - diagonal terms in the initial distribution .",
    "our proof of the theorem also applies to charge exchange scattering .",
    "then the generalized parton densities are off - diagonal in flavor .",
    "they are related by an isospin transformation to non - singlet parton densities ( at non - zero momentum transfer ) .",
    "there should therefore be some possibilities to improve the phenomenology of the ordinary non - singlet quark densities from an analysis of processes like @xmath241    our analysis also has direct implications for scattering off nuclei implying that color transparency phenomena should be present for exclusive production of leading mesons .",
    "we leave the discussion of this subject to a separate paper .",
    "_ note added in proof : _ in fact , the `` off - diagonal parton distributions '' that we use were actually introduced long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the diffractive production of the z boson in dis was considered .",
    "subsequently there is a long history @xcite , including the previously cited paper by balitsky and braun @xcite .",
