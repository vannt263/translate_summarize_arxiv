    "intervalence charge transfer ( ivct ) is the conventional name for electron transfer between two metal sites differing only in oxidation state .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is a particular case of metal - to - metal charge transfer ( mmct ) in which the two metal ions involved in the redox process are identical ; in other words , it is the homonuclear , symmetric mmct .",
    "@xcite the basic theory for electron transfer was formulated by marcus  @xcite and the systematic study of intervalence compounds  @xcite has played a key role in elucidating electron transfer reactions .",
    "the electron transfer between the ground states of the two metal sites can be thermally induced after passing through an activated complex with an activation energy barrier ; in the activated complex the electron is equally distributed among the two metallic centers . the electron transfer can also be photoinduced . in this case",
    ", a fixed nuclei ivct photon absorption takes place that is followed by a nonradiative decay involving nuclei reorganization ; the decay passes through the activated complex and it can branch either to the original state or to the charge transfer state , which are degenerate ( fig .  [ fig : ivct ] , red lines ) . obviously , there can not be any emission associated with the ivct absorption .",
    "ivct absorption explained the early observations of werner  @xcite on the dark color of substances containing platinum in two oxidation states and it was found in a large number of mixed valence compounds ,  @xcite mostly involving transition metals .",
    "the marcus theory of electron tranfer was complemented by hush  @xcite with a theory of heteronuclear mmct and homonuclear ivct considering a two - state problem .",
    "piepho  @xcite formulated a vibronic model for the ivct absorption of the two - state problem .",
    "we are not aware of extensions of these theories to absorptions and emissions involving higher excited states of the mixed valence compounds .",
    "the relevance of mmct transitions in solids has been reviewed by blasse ,  @xcite including ivct absorptions in mixed - valence compounds ; most of the materials involve transition metal ions . in f - element doped solids , mmct between f - elements and the cations of the host have been considered responsible for green - blue luminescence quenching and red luminescence induction in -doped compounds ,  @xcite and a near - ir / visible broad absorption band in ce - doped lapo@xmath12 has been ascribed to a   ivct absorption ,  @xcite for instance , but neither heteronuclear mmct nor homonuclear ivct have been the subject of extensive investigations .",
    "although the ivct absorption is very well known in mixed valence compounds , ivct luminescence transitions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ivct ] blue arrow ) have never been reported , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "a series of  studies on lanthanide optically active centers in solids is leading us to propose that ivct emissions have in fact been observed in ce - doped elpasolites and in yb - doped fluorites , even though they have not been identified as such .",
    "we also expect these emissions to be present in eu - doped solids and in other solids doped with f - elements in which several valence states are likely to coexist .",
    "ivct states are also likely to be responsible for luminescence quenching in many materials . here",
    "we report  calculations on the ivct luminescence of ce - doped . in a separate paper",
    "we report  calculations on the ivct luminescence of yb - doped fluorites .",
    "@xcite    ce - doped  elpasolite is a scintillating material that presents an anomalous luminescence .",
    "@xcite such emission is excited by the @xmath13 absortion but it can not be a usual @xmath14 emission because its energy is much lower than its excitation ( more than 9000  1  lower ) and its band width is very large ( full width at half maximum of 4800  1  at room temperature ) .",
    "its intensity increases with temperature up to 250  k and decreases above it .",
    "this anomalous luminescence was also found in cs@xmath15lucl@xmath1:ce [ ref .",
    "] and : ce [ ref .  ] ; in these materials it is quenched at room temperature but the basic mechanism is likely to be the same in all three .    in this work ,",
    "we interpret the anomalous luminescence of : ce as a  @xmath4 @xmath16  @xmath5 intervalence charge transfer emission that takes place in   active pairs .",
    "this interpretation is based on wave function theory  calculations on ce - doped which involve : the @xmath17 and @xmath18 manifolds of the  active center , and its @xmath19 impurity - trapped exciton ( ite ) ; the  closed - shell center ; and the diabatic energy surfaces of the ",
    "active pair along the electron transfer reaction coordinates of the ground state and excited states .",
    "the results suggest that -  ivct states might also be responsible for other not well understood features of related materials , like unassigned low - t excitation bands of : ce [ ref .  ] and : ce [ ref .  ] , and the anomalous behaviour of the 351  nm emission of : ce under various excitation wavelengths .",
    "@xcite    also , it is shown that the diabatic energy surfaces of the ",
    "mixed valence pairs are sufficient to provide the basic understanding of the states involved in the relevant absorptions , emissions , and nonradiative decays",
    ". they can be obtained from independent  calculations in embedded monometallic clusters of the oxidized and reduced species , like  and .",
    "the adiabatic energy surfaces , which require much more demanding calculations on embedded dimetallic clusters like , are only necessary when electronic interaction between them are expected to be significant and accurate numerical results are targeted .",
    "the intervalence charge transfer luminescence of ce - doped   takes place between states of -  mixed valence active pairs . in secs .",

    ", @xmath22 and @xmath26 will be the mixed valence embedded cluster   with conventional left ",
    "right distributions   and ",
    "we are interested in the energies of the @xmath22 and @xmath26 pairs in their ground and excited states as functions of the nuclear coordinates .",
    "since the electronic spectroscopic transitions are dominated by the totally symmetric vibrational coordinates , we will only consider the breathing modes of octahedral  and , so that the only vibrational degrees of freedom will be the ce - cl distances in the left and right components of the pairs , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "for each nuclear configuration , the electronic states of the pairs result from the combinations between the @xmath29 individual states of @xmath20 and the @xmath30 individual states of @xmath21 . in this case",
    "they will be the states of the @xmath17 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( impurity - trapped exciton ) configurations of combined with the @xmath34 closed - shell state of . besides , since both @xmath22 and @xmath26 electronic configurations are possible , the total number of adiabatic electronic states @xmath35 of the mixed valence pair is @xmath36 . their adiabatic potential energy surfaces ( equivalent to the full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivct ] ) will be @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "these adiabatic energy surfaces can provide basic spectroscopic data without requiring to solve the full vibronic problem , like the positions of absorption and emission band maxima via the frank - condon approximation , and others . in general , they result from direct quantum mechanical calculations on mixed valence dimers , which are highly demanding .",
    "depending on the number of open - shell electrons of the lanthanide , they can be extremely demanding .        independently of the method used for the calculation of the adiabatic potential energy surfaces",
    ", they can be considered to result from the diagonalization of a @xmath39 interaction matrix .",
    "the diagonal elements of the interaction matrix are the diabatic potential energy surfaces ( equivalent to the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivct ] ) and the off - diagonal elements are the electronic couplings .",
    "the diabatic energy surfaces can cross each other and , contrary to the adiabatic , they mantain the nature of the electronic state across the crossings .",
    "the diabatic basis is arbitrary ; a convenient choice is the set of generalized antisymmetric product functions  @xcite resulting from the combination of the states of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "so , from the combination of the @xmath40 state of @xmath20 , @xmath41 , and the @xmath42 state of @xmath21 , @xmath43 , we will have two diabatic wavefunctions : one for the @xmath44 state of @xmath22 , @xmath45 , and one for the @xmath46 state of @xmath26 , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is a normalization constant and @xmath49 is the inter - group antisymmetrization operator  @xcite ) .",
    "their expected values of the fixed nuclei hamiltonian of the embedded pair @xmath50 , are the two corresponding diabatic potential energy surfaces @xmath51 and @xmath52 : their electronic coupling is note that @xmath53 .",
    "we must remark now that , if the full vibronic problem of the mixed valence pair needed to be solved , both the adiabatic basis @xmath54 and the diabatic basis @xmath55 , would be valid alternatives leading to the same vibronic energies and wavefunctions . if , instead , the focus is on some relevant features of the electronic spectra like zero - phonon lines , absorption and emission band maxima and band widths , etc . , or of the electronic states of the mixed valence pair , like equilibrium structures , activation energy barriers , etc . , the adiabatic energy surfaces are the valid ones and the diabatic energy surfaces are an approximation to them .",
    "let us briefly discuss on the limits of the diabatic approximation .    in the regions of the nuclear configuration space where the electronic couplings are not very large",
    ", the adiabatic and diabatic energy surfaces are close , each adiabatic wavefunction @xmath35 is very similar to one of the diabatic wavefunctions , and a particular @xmath56 or @xmath57 character can be associated with it .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath27 and @xmath28 values respectively close to the ce - cl equilibrium distance of the  donor site and of the  acceptor site , one of the adiabatic energies will be close to @xmath58 and another to @xmath59 ; @xmath58 will be the lowest of the two because both the donor and the acceptor are structurally relaxed , and @xmath59 will be the highest of the two because both the donor and the acceptor are structurally stressed , each of them being in the equilibrium structure of the other .",
    "this is an important observation because the calculations of the diabatic energy surfaces , which can be hihgly demanding , are always significantly less demanding than the calculations of the adiabatic ones .    in the regions of the nuclear configuration space near crossings of diabatic energy surfaces ,",
    "e.g. near the activated complex where the electronic couplings have larger effects and produce avoided crossings .",
    "the crossing diabatic states are then replaced by a lower adiabatic state with a smaller thermal energy barrier , plus an upper adiabatic state which has become stable at the configuration where the electron is equally distributed among the two metals ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ivct ] ) . in these regions ,",
    "the adiabatic results are necessary when quantitative energy barriers or quantitative nonradiative dynamics are targeted .",
    "many of the spectroscopic features of the mixed valence pairs can however be addressed quantitatively or semiquantitatively with the diabatic energy surfaces only .",
    "we describe next how they can be computed .",
    "the diabatic pair energies are the sum of the donor and acceptor energies plus their mutual coulomb and exchange interaction .",
    "@xcite the latter should be almost independent of the donor and acceptor states , in general .",
    "hence , we can write : @xmath60 in eq .",
    "[ eq : eda ] , @xmath61 and @xmath62 include the embedding interactions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 with the crystalline environment of the @xmath22 pair in .",
    "we aim at computing @xmath58 by means of embedded cluster calculations and we can think of two alternative computational strategies : in one of them , the symmetry reductions around @xmath20 and @xmath21 due to the presence of the other ( @xmath21 and @xmath20 respectively ) are considered from the very beginning . in the other , they are removed in a first step and they are considered later , at the same time that the electronic couplings , i.e. when the adiabatic surfaces are calculated .",
    "the strength of the first approach is to be able to give energy splittings driven by symmetry lowering , which are dependent on the distance and relative orientation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the strength of the second approach is to be able to give the basics of the energy surfaces by means of independent calculations on the embedded @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "it has , however , an important computational advantage : the diabatic potential energy surfaces of the mixed valence pairs are computed using the energy curves of the donor and acceptor centers embedded in the original host lattice , i.e. of the clusters  and  embedded in  in our case .",

    "@xcite this ivct luminescence is the vertical one - electron orbital transition @xmath16 and it is followed by a strong nuclei reorganization around  and .",
    "this involves a large ce - cl distance shortening around  and a large ce - cl distance elongation around , and it releases an energy which is very similar to the energy of the ivct absorption * 7*. the only difference between these energies arises from the fact that the ce - cl equilibrium bond length in the  center is different in its @xmath32 states and @xmath17 states , but this difference is much smaller than the offset between the minima of the @xmath181 and @xmath173 branches along the electron transfer normal coordinate @xmath202 , which determines the reorganization energy .",

    "the experimental stokes shift of the anomalous emission , calculated as the difference between the experimental absorption maximum ( 46900  1  average of the jt split excitation ) and the anomalous emission maximum ( 36400  1 ) is 10500  1 .    the calculation predicts this ivct emission band to be a very wide band with peaks in the 32000 - 35300  1  region ( table  [ tab : ceiii - ceiv ] ) .",

    "[ fig : abs - em]b .",
    "since the diabatic calculations do not provide oscillator strengths , we have used the oscillator strengths of the regular @xmath14 emission in table  [ tab : oscil_strengths ] of additional material in order to be able to simulate the band shape .",
    "accordingly , the intensities of the ivct emission band and the @xmath14 emission band in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs - em]b can not be compared , but we must expect that the different shapes of both emission bands are fairly well reproduced . the ivct emission is a very broad band with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of about 5000  1 .",
    "the experimental fwhm at 290  k is 4800  1 .",
    "so , both the position and shape of this band correspond well with the anomalous emission ( e2 ) .",
    "moreover , the following additional supporting argument on the band width can be given : first , we should expect the ivct emission * 10 * to have a band shape very similar to that of the regular ivct absorption * 7 * , because both of them have very similar normal coordinate offsets .",
    "second , the band width @xmath203 ( in 1 ) and band maximum @xmath204 ( in 1 ) of the latter are related according to @xmath205 at temperatures t ( in k ) high enough so that @xmath206 , @xmath207 being the vibrational frequency ;  @xcite and using the experimental stokes shift of the anomalous emission for @xmath204 , @xmath204=10500  1 , we get at t=290  k a fwhm of @xmath203=4850  1 , which agrees very well with the experimental fwhm of the anomalous emission .    according to the interpretation given in this paper , the anomalous emission is not due to an electron - hole recombination in which the electron is in the conduction band and the hole in the ce impurity , and there is no anomalous state .",
    "instead , the emission is an electron transfer from a @xmath4 orbital of a  center to a @xmath5 orbital of a  center , which takes place with frozen nuclei positions and leaves the newly formed  and  centers in their ground electronic states and under strong structural stress .",
    "the large relaxation energy released afterwars is basically the large stokes shift of this emission .",
    "this is graphically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivctl ] of additional material .",
    "if an electron - hole recombination description is to be used , the electron is in a  center and the hole in a  center , but this kind of description is not very adequate because such a recombanition of electron and hole would still leave a hole and an electron .",
    "the principal excitation of the anomalous emission is the   absorption ( a2 , cf .",
    "5c and 5d in ref .  ) ; this is in agreement with the emission starting in the @xmath158 manifold .",
    "also , two additional broad peaks have been identified in its excitation spectrum at 54300  1  ( a9 ) and 57500  1  ( a10 ) ; they can be made of absorptions from the @xmath21 branch to the @xmath208 , @xmath20 , and @xmath209 branches , i.e. to @xmath16 ivct absorption and absorptions to the impurity - trapped exciton .",
    "we must note that the electronic couplings , which are missing in the diabatic energy surfaces , will have a stronger effect on the states of these excited branches .",
    "this and the lower symmetry driven splittings also missing here , indicate that the states at about 5000 - 10000  1  above the  @xmath32 manifold should be a strong mix of the diabatic states of the @xmath208 , @xmath20 , and @xmath209 branches .",
    "they can be responsible for the above mentioned peaks , but also for the peaks at 54900 and 56800  1of the excitation spectrum of the   emission ( a7 , a8 ) .",
    "the 56800  1  peak was assigned to an impurity - trapped exciton in ref .  .",
    "another specific feature of the anomalous emission of ce - doped is that it is not excited by absorptions to the conduction band ( cb ) , although these absorptions effectively excite the emission .",
    "@xcite such absortions mean an ionization of  to the cb that destroys the   pair , so that for the anomalous emission to happen , the electron must be transferred back from the cb to the @xmath4 empty orbital of .",
    "the present calculation does not give information on this ; calculations on metal - to - metal charge transfer in ce - lu , ce - cs , and ce - li pairs will be the subject of further study .    finally , in ref .",
    "it was shown that the decay time of the anomalous emission excited with the absorption was found to remain constant from 12  k to 240  k , to start dropping at 240  k ( cf .",
    "fig .  8 in ref .  ) , and to quench at 370  k. following its correlation with the emission it was also shown that the anomalous emission is quenched by means of energy transfer to the @xmath31 states of . fitting the parameters of a kinetic model to the experimental data led them to an activation energy of 2900  1 .",
    "parallely , the absorption was found to excite the emission , although no connection with the above activation energy was made .",
    "all these observations are consistent with the present interpretation . in effect",
    ", the @xmath181-@xmath186 crossing is responsible for the decay from the state that emits the anomalous luminescence ( though it is a @xmath32 state and not an anomalous state ) to the @xmath31 state .",
    "such crossing gives the activation energy of the thermal process @xmath16 .",
    "the diabatic result found here is 5100  1 .",
    "this value is reduced by the jahn - teller splitting of the @xmath32 state , it will be further reduced by the inclusion of electronic couplings and , perhaps more importantly , by a lower crystal - field splitting and by a larger offset between the minima of the @xmath181 and @xmath182 branches .",
    "we already commented above that the present calculation overestimates the crystal field splitting and underestimations of the nuclear offsets are common in calculations of this type .",
    "@xcite and this interpretation also explains that the absorption excites the emission .    besides , the quenching of the emission can be related to the @xmath180-@xmath177 crossing , i.e. to the thermal process @xmath16 .",
    "this is found to have a diabatic activation energy of 5800  1 , higher than that of the @xmath32 decay but not much . with the same arguments than before",
    ", we should expect this barrier to be reduced upon inclusion of the missing contributions , but not more than the other , so that the results indicate that the activation energy is slightly larger for the non - radiative decay of the @xmath31 states than of the @xmath32 states .",
    "hence a larger quenching temperature of the emission compared with the anomalous emission .    before ending this discussion",
    "we may remark that , according to these results , we may expect the existence of an ivct emission of lower energy corresponding to the vertical one - electron orbital transition @xmath16 , which is to say to the transiton @xmath210 , or @xmath16 .",
    "this transition is expected to appear at an energy lower than the emission by an amount very similar the first ivct absortion , 10000  1  in our case , i.e. at about 14000 - 16000  1 .",
    "the new interpretation of the electronic excited states of ce - doped  is summarized in table  [ tab : exp2 ] .",
    "in this paper we report for the first time the existence of intervalence charge transfer luminescence . we have shown that the so called anomalous luminescence of ce - doped , which is characterized mainly by a very large stokes shift and a very large band width , corresponds to an ivct emission that takes place in ",
    "pairs , in particular to the vertical one - electron orbital transition @xmath16 .",
    "the stokes shift is the sum of the large reorganization energies of the  and  centers formed after the electron transfer .",
    "it equals the energy of the ivct absortion , which is predicted to exist in this material and to be slightly larger than 10000  1 .",
    "the large band width is the consequence of the large offset between the minima of the   and   pairs along the electron transfer reaction coordinate , which is approximately @xmath7 times the difference of ce - cl equilibrium distances in the  and  centers .",
    "we have shown that the energies of the peaks and the widths of ivct absortion and emission bands can be calculated  with reasonable accuracy from diabatic energy surfaces of the ground and excited states and that these can be obtained , in turn , from independent  calculations on the donor and acceptor active centers .",

    "<S> the existence of intervalence charge transfer ( ivct ) luminescence is reported . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the so called anomalous luminescence of ce - doped elpasolite cs@xmath0lilucl@xmath1 , which is characterized mainly by a very large stokes shift and a very large band width , corresponds to an ivct emission that takes place in ce@xmath2ce@xmath3 pairs , from the @xmath4 orbital of ce@xmath2 to @xmath5 orbitals of ce@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> its stokes shift is the sum of the large reorganization energies of the ce@xmath3 and ce@xmath2 centers formed after the fixed - nuclei electron transfer and it is equal to the energy of the ivct absortion commonly found in mixed - valence compounds , which is predicted to exist in this material and to be slightly larger than 10000  @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the large band width is the consequence of the large offset between the minima of the ce@xmath2ce@xmath3 and ce@xmath3ce@xmath2 pairs along the electron transfer reaction coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> this offset is approximately @xmath7 times the difference of ce - cl equilibrium distances in the ce@xmath2 and ce@xmath3 centers . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the energies of the peaks and the widths of ivct absortion and emission bands can be calculated _ ab initio _ with reasonable accuracy from diabatic energy surfaces of the ground and excited states and that these can be obtained , in turn , from independent calculations on the donor and acceptor active centers . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the energies of the ce@xmath2 and ce@xmath3 active centers of ce - doped cs@xmath0lilucl@xmath1 by means of state - of - the - art wave - function - theory spin - orbit coupling relativistic calculations on the donor cluster ( cecl@xmath1li@xmath1cs@xmath8)@xmath9 and the acceptor cluster ( cecl@xmath1li@xmath1cs@xmath8)@xmath10 embedded in a quantum mechanical embedding potential of the host . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations provide interpretations of unexplained experimental observations as due to higher energy ivct absorptions , and allow to reinterpret others . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of another ivct emission of lower energy , at around 14000 - 16000  @xmath6 less than the @xmath11 emission , is also predicted . </S>"
