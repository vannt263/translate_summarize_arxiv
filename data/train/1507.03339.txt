    "non - covalent interactions play a fundamental role in chemistry and chemical - physics because of their importance in many phenomena including , among others , biochemistry , solvation , supermolecular organization , and molecular recognition . for this reason they have been subject of intense research @xcite . however , because the strength of non - covalent interactions is one or two order of magnitude smaller than that of typical covalent interactions , ranging from few tens to few tenths of kcal / mol , special care is required for accurate quantitative studies .    from a computational point of view",
    "this implies the need for high - level correlated wave function methods , being capable to describe correlation effects with good accuracy @xcite .",
    "additional computational issues , such as the basis set superposition and the basis set incompleteness errors , must be properly taken into account as well @xcite .",
    "finally , it must be considered that , because of the rather weak nature of non - covalent bonds , the description of non - covalent complexes can not be restricted to the equilibrium geometry , but , in many cases , must be extended to include a more or less extended portion of the potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "actually the method of choice for an accurate computational description of non - covalent complexes is the coupled cluster single and double with perturbative triple ( ccsd(t ) ) approach @xcite with a complete basis set ( cbs ) description @xcite .",
    "this method provides in fact interaction energies with subchemical accuracy and yields errors often below 1 kcal / mol @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the ccsd(t ) method is computationally very demanding , scaling as @xmath0 , thus its applicability is limited to small complexes . on the other hand ,",
    "lower level approaches , such as mller - plesset second - order perturbation theory ( mp2 ) @xcite or even ccsd(t ) calculations with a relatively small basis set , fail to describe various types of non - covalent interactions with the necessary accuracy .",
    "therefore , continuous effort is dedicated to the development of new methods able of providing reliable results for non - covalent complexes at a reduced computational cost .",
    "recently one step in this direction has been performed by proposing a simple non - empirical scaling procedure for mp2 interaction energies which allows to obtain a full dissociation curve of ccsd(t ) quality at the cost of a single ccsd(t ) calculation @xcite .",
    "this method is based on an observed proportionality of the mp2 and ccsd(t ) interaction energies which is maintained , with almost a constant factor , over a wide range on inter - molecular distances .",
    "thus , accurate dissociation curves can be computed , with a precision of few hundreds of mha , for many non - covalent complexes with a reduced effort . however ,",
    "for high accuracy the proposed scaling procedure still requires one ccsd(t)/cbs calculation , which may be out of reach for larger scale applications .    in this paper",
    "we address this latest issue and propose a new methodology which joins the above mentioned scaling procedure with a basis set extrapolation scheme , so that finally highly accurate interaction energies can be computed by the sole requirement of relatively low - level calculations ( e.g. mp2 and/or ccsd(t ) with moderate basis sets ) . in this way",
    "a practical and efficient tool for large - scale application can be obtained .",
    "the main quantity of interest in this work is the correlation interaction energy . for calculations carried out with method @xmath1 and using the basis set aug - cc - pv@xmath2z it is denoted @xmath3 and defined as the difference of the correlation energies ( @xmath4 , calculated using method @xmath1 and basis set aug - cc - pv@xmath2z , with @xmath5 i.e. d , t , q,5 ) for a complex @xmath6 and its constituent fragments @xmath7 and @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 - e_{c , x}^{(n)}[a ] - e_{c , x}^{(n)}[b]\\ .\\ ] ] according to ref .",
    "@xcite the ccsd(t ) correlation interaction energy of a non - covalent complex at any inter - molecular separation @xmath10 is related to the mp2 correlation interaction energy by the simple equation @xmath11 where the factor @xmath12 is evaluated as @xmath13 with @xmath14 being any reference point ( for example , but not necessarily , the equilibrium inter - molecular separation @xmath15 ) .",
    "equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) allow to compute a full pes ( with @xmath16 points ) of ccsd(t ) quality at the cost of a single ccsd(t ) calculation ( at distance @xmath14 ) and several ( i.e. @xmath16 ) mp2 calculations .    when the cbs limit is considered , which formally corresponds to @xmath17 , the scaling factor of eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) shall be computed as @xmath18 , where both @xmath19 and @xmath20 have to be obtained via appropriate extrapolation formulas ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the bottleneck of this computational approach is certainly the calculation of @xmath19 . to avoid this",
    "we consider an alternative way to compute @xmath21 . to this end",
    "we assume that the basis set evolution of the proportionality factor @xmath12 is described by the ansatz @xmath22 where @xmath7 and @xmath23 are assumed to be two system - dependent constants ( note that they do not depend on @xmath2 ) .",
    "a rationalization for this ansatz is given in [ appa ] .",
    "a graphical impression of its accuracy for some typical non - covalent complexes is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     scaling factors @xmath12 as functions of @xmath24 ( where @xmath2 defines the basis sets aug - cc - pv@xmath2z ) for some non - covalent complexes .",
    "the dashed line shows the fit according to eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) . ]",
    "this figure shows in fact , for some selected complexes , the evolution of the values of the scaling factors @xmath12 with the basis set as well as the fit obtained via eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "we see that the postulated power behavior reproduces very well the trend of the computed scaling factors from @xmath25 ( aug - cc - pvdz ) to @xmath26 ( cbs limit ) .    in practice , we apply eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) for two given values of @xmath2 ( we use @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) so that the cbs proportionality factor is given by the simple two - point formula @xmath29 where the only unknown parameter , so far , is @xmath23 .",
    "equation ( [ e4 ] ) allows to obtain an estimate for @xmath21 avoiding the computationally expensive calculation of @xmath19 , requiring at most the evaluation of @xmath30 , which is necessary to obtain @xmath31 from eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath23 should be , in principle system dependent .",
    "however , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we will fix it by fitting to some appropriate training set ( see later on ) .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ e4 ] ) becomes a universal formula for obtaining @xmath32 .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) it is possible to obtain a good approximation of @xmath33 in a very efficient way via eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , two possible variants can be considered :    * in a first approach , that we denote m1 , we will use the best estimate available for @xmath20 , in practice , a cubic extrapolation formula @xcite using aug - cc - pvqz and aug - cc - pv5z data ( other extrapolation formulas will not be considered here , since they will yield only slightly different results ) .",
    "hence , the m1 correlation interaction energy is computed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is given by eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) with @xmath23 fitted on a training set to reproduce reference values of the @xmath36 coefficient at the reference cbs limit . within this approach , to compute a full pes of @xmath16 points with ccsd(t)/cbs quality , the most computationally intensive steps required are one ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz calculation and @xmath16 mp2 calculations with large basis set ( aug - cc - pv5z in our case ) , one for each point of the pes . * a cheaper method , which will be denoted m2 , can be obtained using a simpler formula to evaluate @xmath37 . doing this by means of the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath38 where the value of the coefficient @xmath39 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath40 is given again by eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) with a proper value of @xmath23 ( see below ) . in this case",
    "only @xmath41 calculations instead of @xmath42 are required at most .",
    "thus , the global computational cost of the whole procedure is practically reduced to the calculation of one @xmath30 ( to compute @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) ) . of course , in this case to obtain high accuracy it is not possible to use the same @xmath23 value as for the m1 method ( hence , we used the subscripts m1 and m2 to denote the scaling factors in the two methods ) . on the contrary",
    ", it must be determined by fitting to the cbs values of ccsd(t ) reference correlation interaction energies , and not cbs limit @xmath36 values , in order to effectively take into account also the possible inaccuracies on the extrapolated mp2 energy .    .[tab1]computed and extrapolated values of the proportionality factors @xmath12 for the systems of the training set .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      mean absolute errors ( kcal / mol ) with respect to accurate values @xcite for the total interaction energies of non - covalent complexes of the s22x5 test set at different bonding distances @xmath43 as obtained from several theoretical approaches .",
    "accurate mp2c , mp2.5 , and scs - ccsd results are taken from ref .",
    "]    the plots reported in the figure as well as the data of table [ tab4 ] confirm the results of tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] , showing that the m2 method is competitive with the ccsd(t)-23 approach , as well as with other high level methods ( e.g. accurate mp2.5 , mp2c , or scs - ccsd ) and can clearly improve over the mp2 - 23 and scs(mi)-mp2/cbs results .",
    "we remark that this performance is obtained for all distances by requiring only a single ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz calculation . moreover , although no clear systematic trend can be obtained for the accuracy of different methods versus the bonding character type , we remark that the observed behavior of m2 is rather consistent for all the complexes and distances with ccsd(t)-23 , being even slightly superior for dispersion complexes . on the contrary ,",
    "mp2 - 23 appears rather accurate only for hydrogen bond complexes .",
    "finally , we remark that for @xmath44 , where more accurate reference data @xcite than those in ref .",
    "@xcite are available , the results do not change substantially when the best reference values are used .",
    "in fact , in this latter case the maes ( mares ) of mp2 - 23 , scs(mi)-mp2/cbs , ccsd(t)-23 , and m2 are 1.13 ( 19.5% ) , 0.70 ( 14.5% ) , 0.28 ( 6.0% ) , and 0.31 ( 6.7% ) , respectively , in good agreement with the values reported in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "we have proposed efficient scaling procedures to compute accurate correlation interaction energies of non - covalent complexes .",
    "our methods are based on the observed proportionality between mp2 and ccsd(t ) interaction energies as well as on simple basis set extrapolation formulas . in this way",
    "correlation interaction energies of ccsd(t)/cbs quality can efficiently be obtained from few mp2 and ccsd(t ) calculations using small basis sets .",
    "if several bonding distances are of interest , as in pes scanning studies , even a lower computational cost is achieved by exploiting the ( almost ) constancy of the scaling factors with respect to inter - molecular distance .",
    "thus , the present methods , and in particular the m2 one , represent promising tools for future studies of large non - covalent systems , e.g. in biochemistry .",
    "nevertheless , future developments can be foreseen starting from the present results , especially to improve further the overall computational efficiency . in this sense",
    ", it will be particularly interesting to consider the extension of the present methodology to scaled - opposite - spin ( sos ) mp2 calculations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the sos - mp2 method can be implemented with a favorable @xmath45 scaling ( as opposed to the @xmath46 of conventional mp2 ) and also displays a proportionality with accurate correlation results @xcite .",
    "this work was partially supported by the national science center under grant no .",
    "dec-2013/11/b / st4/00771 .",
    "following refs . @xcite we can write @xmath47 where @xmath8 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are constants . taking the ratio of the two equations we find @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( note these are constants with respect to @xmath2 ) . now observing that @xmath54 we can write @xmath55 \\approx\\\\ & \\approx & c^{(\\infty ) } + \\tilde{b}n^{-\\beta } - c^{(\\infty)}\\tilde{c}n^{-\\gamma}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , considering that @xmath56 ( see refs .",
