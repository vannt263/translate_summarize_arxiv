    "if qcd phase phase transition is of first order in nature then there are many important consequences in the context of early universe as well as in heavy ion collisions . in the conventional picture of a first order phase transition",
    ", the transition happens through homogeneous nucleation of hadronic bubbles in the background of qgp phases .",
    "hadronic bubbles thus formed will keep expanding , coalesce and eventually complete the phase transition .",
    "one of the important consequences in this scenario , in the context of the early universe , is the concentration of baryon numbers inside the shrinking qgp bubbles which eventually can even form quark nuggets @xcite due to high concentrations of baryon number inside the shrinking qgp phases .",
    "it was also shown that concentration of baryon number in the qgp phase can produce large baryon fluctuations which can survive against various dissipative processes @xcite upto nucleosynthesis epoch and can alter the primordial abundances @xcite .",
    "ignatius and schwarz studied @xcite the presence of density fluctuations ( those arising from inflation ) at quark - hadron transition and showed that it will lead to splitting of the region in hot and cold regions with cold regions converting to hadronic phase first .",
    "baryons will then get trapped in the ( initially ) hotter regions .",
    "estimates of sizes and separations of such density fluctuations were made in ref.@xcite using cobe measurements of the temperature fluctuations in cmbr . in our earlier work @xcite , we considered the effect of cosmic string induced density fluctuations on quark - hadron transition and showed that such density fluctuations at qcd epoch can lead to formation of extended planar regions of baryon inhomogeneity .",
    "detailed profile of baryon inhomogeneities and it s effect on standard big bang nucleosynthesis were discussed in ref.@xcite .    here , we study another aspect of the qcd phase transition in the context of early universe if the transition is of 1st order in nature , that is , axion inhomogeneity generation during quark - hadron transition in the presence of cosmic string induced density fluctuations .",
    "axion was first introduced to solve strong cp problem @xcite and has been extensively investigated primarily due to its possible role as a dark matter candidate .",
    "recently it has been discussed @xcite that due to the larger mass of axion in the hadronic phase compared to the qgp phase , axions will get trapped inside the shrinking qgp bubbles at the quark - hadron transition ( somewhat in the similar manner as baryon trapping occurs in shrinking qgp bubbles @xcite ) .",
    "the axions which are initially trapped inside the qgp phase will gradually pick up momentum from the walls of the shrinking bubbles and leave the qgp phase @xcite . these axions which are left behind as the qgp bubbles collapse can form iso - curvature fluctuations .",
    "the minimum momentum @xmath0 required to leave the qgp regions is given by ,    @xmath1    where , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the axion masses in the hadron phase and qgp phase respectively",
    ".    we study this phenomenon of axion trapping when cosmic strings are present in the early universe .",
    "cosmic strings are generically produced by gut phase transitions .",
    "further , it has been recently shown that superstring theories also lead to cosmic strings with acceptable parameters @xcite(see also ref .",
    "it therefore becomes important to investigate how such cosmic strings can affect the universe .",
    "( it is clear by now from latest wmap data that contributions of cosmic strings and other topological defects to structure formation is insignificant @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown earlier that the process of hadronization will be delayed in the cosmic string wakes at the quark - hadron transition @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of shrinking quark phases is very different in our model compared to the conventional scenario based on homogeneous bubble nucleation .",
    "geometry of the collapsing interface in our case is of sheet like planar structure unlike spherical in the conventional case .",
    "thus , the iso - curvature fluctuations produced , as the axions leave the wake region , will spread in a sheet like regions in contrast to the spherical clumps as studied by hindmarsh @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to study the subsequent evolution of large fluctuations with such geometrical structure and its astrophysical consequences .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the axion production from cosmic axionic string and it s temperature dependent mass following ref .",
    "@xcite . sec .",
    "iii discusses the nature of density fluctuations as expected from straight cosmic string moving through relativistic fluid .",
    "density fluctuations produced by the moving `` wiggly '' string is also discussed in this section . in sec .",
    "iv , the dynamics of quark - hadron transition in the presence of string wakes and the mechanism of axion trapping in our model have been discussed . in sec .",
    "v , we give our result . summary and possible astrophysical consequences have been discussed in the final section vi .",
    "the presence of the so called @xmath4 term in the qcd lagrangian violates cp invariance .",
    "the most stringent bound on this @xmath5 comes from the electric dipole moment measurement of neutron .",
    "such extremely small value of @xmath4 in the strong interaction theory is called `` strong cp problem '' .",
    "one of the most elegant solutions of this problem was first proposed by peccei and quinn @xcite by introducing an axial @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry at some scale @xmath7 can cause @xmath4 to settle down at some vacuum value . at the qcd scale",
    "instanton effects lead to explicit breaking of this @xmath6 symmetry forcing @xmath4 to settle down at the true vacuum @xmath8 .",
    "however , due to spontaneous breaking of @xmath6 symmetry , the phase of the field can wind around the vacuum manifold non - trivially in the physical space , forming the so called axionic string .",
    "after formation the strings are stuck in the plasma and are stretched by the hubble expansion . during this time the dominant mechanism of dissipating energy",
    "is via heat due to the large frictional force exerted by the background plasma .",
    "however , with time the plasma becomes dilute and below a temperature @xmath9 which is given by @xcite ,    @xmath10    the strings move freely .",
    "the corresponding time @xmath11 , can be obtained from the following time - temperature relation ,    @xmath12    and is given by ,    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the number of degrees of freedom relevant at temperature @xmath9 ( taking all the species in the standard model ) .",
    "after @xmath11 , the string will lose energy through radiation of ( pseudo ) goldstone bosons which are called axions .",
    "the axion is not truly a goldstone bosons .",
    "it will acquire mass due to the axial anomaly @xcite once the instanton effect turns on . in the high temperature phase ( @xmath15 )",
    ", the mass of axions arises from the @xmath4-dependent part of the free energy density which have been calculated by preskil et al .",
    "@xcite in the dilute - instanton- gas approximations . for three quark flavors",
    "appropriate for t not too high compared to @xmath16 , they have determined the mass as ,    @xmath17   [ { m_u m_d m_s \\over { \\lambda ^{3 } } } ^{1/2}][{\\lambda \\over { \\pi t}}]^{4 }   [ 9 ln { \\lambda \\over { \\pi t}}]^{4}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath18 are the current quark masses of u , d and s quark respectively and @xmath19 is the qcd scale .",
    "taking critical temperature @xmath20 and putting the values of u , d and s quark masses ( see ref.@xcite for details ) , we get the axion mass at the onset of qcd transition and can be written in terms of axionic string formation scale as ,    @xmath21    at low temperature in the hadron phase , the axion mass is calculated from the current - algebra technique which gives the value @xcite ,    @xmath22    here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the mass and decay constant of pions respectively .",
    "the axion mass being temperature dependent at high temperature phase as in eq.(5 ) , it s very light and ultra - relativistic at very high temperature .",
    "it becomes dynamically significant at the temperature at which compton wave length of the axions fall within the horizon .",
    "this is the time ( @xmath25 ) , at which axion string will not be able to oscillate sufficiently to radiate axions due to damping of domain walls attached to each string . from the time temperature relation eq.(3 ) one can get the time @xmath26 , from the following relation ( neglecting the logarithmic dependence on t in eq.(5 ) ) ,    @xmath27    where , @xmath28 is the mass of the axion at the onset of qcd phase transition obtained from eq.(5 ) .",
    "thus , one gets the time @xmath26 as ,    @xmath29^{-1/3 } t_c \\simeq 1.6   \\times 10^{-3 } sec ( { \\eta_a \\over { 10^{12 } gev}})^{1/3 }   ( { t_c \\over sec})^{2/3}\\ ] ]    here , we will study the fluctuations in the density of axions which are produced through the radiation from the axionic string during the era , @xmath30 as in ref . @xcite . during this time",
    "one can assume that string network will enter into the scaling regime which has been discussed extensively in literature ( see , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . under the scaling assumption the spectrum of axions in the comoving momentum range @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be considered to be flat @xcite .",
    "we will take the number density distribution of axions resulting from axionic string decay in the comoving momentum range @xmath33 and @xmath34 as given in ref .",
    "@xcite as ,    @xmath35    where , @xmath36 is the scale factor at time @xmath25 , and @xmath37 is the corresponding critical density of the universe .",
    "we will consider the above density distribution with suitable dilution factor due to expansion of the universe inside the wake - like overdensity density regions produced at qcd epoch as discussed in the following section .",
    "in this section we will review the formation of density fluctuations due to cosmic string moving through relativistic fluid .",
    "first , we will discuss the case for a long straight string assuming it does not have any small scale structure .",
    "though , simulations @xcite on the string network in the expanding universe show that the long cosmic string possesses substantial amount of small scale `` wiggly '' structures running along the strings .",
    "the presence of such wiggles makes the string heavier and slows down the motion of the string as a whole .",
    "however , as we discuss below , even the presence of such wiggles along the string will not alter the order of magnitude estimate of density fluctuations produced at qcd epoch .",
    "therefore , for simplicity of presentation we will consider the case of straight ( i.e. , with no small scale structure ) strings first and then we briefly discuss for the case of wiggly strings .    to discuss the generation of density fluctuations by moving straight string ,",
    "we take the metric describing the space - time around the string ( lying along z - axis ) as @xcite ,    @xmath38    here , @xmath39 is the mass per unit length ( equal to string tension ) of the straight string .",
    "this metric can be put in minskowski form by defining angle @xmath40 , where new angle @xmath41 varies between 0 and @xmath42 instead of 0 and @xmath43 .",
    "a test particle at rest with respect to the string does not feel any gravitational force .",
    "however , when the string moves with velocity @xmath44 , the nearby matter gets an impulsive velocity along the direction of the surface swept by the moving string . for collisionless particles ,",
    "the resulting impulsive velocity @xcite is @xmath45 .",
    "this effect is responsible for the formation of wake @xcite and for collisionless particles , this leads to planar structure of density fluctuation . in this case",
    ", the density fluctuations will be of order unity with opening angle of the wake being equal to the deficit angle @xmath46 .",
    "however , at qcd epoch the universe was dominated by the relativistic plasma .",
    "so , to study the density structure of the wake at that epoch , the description of matter should be taken in terms of a relativistic fluid rather than collisionless particles .",
    "generation of density fluctuations due to a cosmic string moving through a relativistic fluid has been analyzed in the literature @xcite , where it has been shown that for supersonic velocities of string , a wake - like shock is formed behind the string .",
    "we will follow ref .",
    "@xcite , where the equations of motion of a relativistic fluid are solved in the string space - time ( eq.(11 ) ) , and both subsonic and supersonic flows are analyzed .",
    "one finds that for supersonic flow , a shock develops behind the string , just as in the study of ref .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the resulting density fluctuations can be expressed in terms of four - velocity and given by ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the four velocity of fluid ( in the string rest frame ) and four velocity of sound respectively , with @xmath50 being the sound speed .",
    "@xmath51 is the angle of the shock . in this case ,",
    "when string velocity @xmath52 is ultra - relativistic , then one can get strong over densities ( of order 1 ) and the angle of the wake approaches the deficit angle @xmath53 . to discuss the effect of density fluctuations on qcd phase transition",
    "we will follow our previous work @xcite and take the sample value of density fluctuations and the angle of the shock as ,    @xmath54    these values are obtained from eq.(12 ) for string velocity of 0.9 , sound velocity @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 ( for 10@xmath58 gev gut strings ) .    here , we should mention that the axion being very weakly interactive @xcite , they can be considered to be a fluid consisting of collisionless particles . therefore , description of wake formation for collisionless particles as mentioned above can be operative for axions also and can lead to formation of axionic density fluctuations @xmath59 of order unity with angle of the wake , @xmath60 .",
    "these over dense axions could be concentrated within very thin sheet like region of thickness @xmath61 ( @xmath62 km being the horizon size at @xmath63 mev ) .",
    "( one has to properly account for the wavelength of axions . )",
    "however , we will see below that the magnitude of the density fluctuations produced through axion trapping ( which is our main topic of discussion in this paper ) by the collapsing interfaces will be very large compared to the above density fluctuation .",
    "essentially , this thin sheet like region will be trapped initially inside the wake of larger thickness which is produced by the formation of shock by moving string through relativistic fluid ( as discussed above ) .",
    "ultimately , axions will also escape from this thin wake and contribute in producing overall iso - curvature fluctuations .",
    "however , their effect will be very insignificant .",
    "even the presence of wiggles along the string as we discuss below , will not change the order of magnitude estimate of such axionic density fluctuations . therefore , to make the physical picture of axion trapping simpler , we will not consider these kind of fluctuations in this work and we will focus only on iso - curvature fluctuations produced through trapping of axions inside the collapsing interfaces of the wake .",
    "so far we have discussed density fluctuations produced by the straight string assuming it does not have any small scale structure .",
    "but , as we mentioned above , the string has small - scale wiggly structures @xcite running along the string .",
    "the presence of such wiggles increase the average energy density of the string and makes the strings to move slower . for physics at large scales ( compared to the scale of wiggles @xmath64 , which is expected to be set by the gravitational - radiation from the string @xcite and given as , @xmath65 where @xmath66 100 ) , the effect of wiggles is taken into account by defining the effective mass per unit length @xmath67 and the string tension @xmath68 . unlike the case of straight string , these quantities for perturbed string are not equal and they are related by the equation of state @xcite , @xmath69 . due to the presence of these small scale structure",
    ", the static wiggly strings develop newtonian gravitational field and a test particle at rest with respect to such perturbed string experiences attractive gravitational force .",
    "the metric around the wiggly string and density structure of the wake for collisionless particles have been studied and discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , for moving wiggly string , total impulsive velocity imparted on the particles towards the surface swept out by the string can be written as @xcite ,    @xmath70    where , first term is the usual velocity impulse arises due to the conical structure of the space - time around the wiggly string , with @xmath39 being replaced by the effective mass per unit length @xmath71 .",
    "the second term arises due to the newtonian gravitational field developed by the wiggliness of the string . using the value of @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we see from eq.(14 ) that if the string moves with ultrarelativistic speed , then the first term will dominate over the gravitational term .",
    "the rms velocity of the wiggly string on the scale of smallest wiggles found out to be , @xcite @xmath74 . for this case",
    ", gravitational term can be neglected . in this case , density fluctuations for collisionless particles will be order of unity with opening angle , @xmath75",
    ". however , the velocity of the string obtained by taking average over a correlation length comes out to be very small ( @xmath76 ) for which gravitational effect should be taken into account .",
    "formation of density structure of wake for collisionless particles have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming the particles remain at a distance far from the string and the particles will experience only averaged effect of the wiggles ( in this case , relevant velocity is , @xmath76 ) . in the string",
    "rest frame ( string lying along z - axis ) , if the particles moves with velocity @xmath44 in the ( + ve ) x direction , then following ref .",
    "@xcite , resulting density fluctuations can be written as ,    @xmath77    where , @xmath78 is of order of the inter - string separation .",
    "note , setting the second term equal to zero , one recovers the result for density structure of the wake for straight string .",
    "if we put the value of wiggly string parameter in eq.(15 ) , we see that order of magnitude of density fluctuations will not be affected compared to the case of straight string .",
    "we will see later that due to the trapping mechanism , axion density can increase in the wake by many orders of magnitude .",
    "we thus conclude that generation of density fluctuation by axions ( being collisionless ) by above phenomenon is insignificant compared to the case where axionic fluctuations happens through trapping mechanism inside the wake produced by relativistic fluid .",
    "therefore , we will ignore this effect in our subsequent discussion .",
    "now , we discuss the effect of wiggliness on the value of density fluctuations ( eq.(13 ) ) produced by moving string through the relativistic fluid . study on formation of shock by moving wiggly string has been done in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite under some simplifying assumptions . in their study , authors have treated the fluid as a non - viscous , non - relativistic fluid . as has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the assumptions of non - relativistic fluid can be good approximation for the string velocity @xmath79 which is relevant for the distance scale larger than the scale of the wiggles .",
    "formation of wakes for wiggly strings has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite after recombination .",
    "it is also mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that similar wake should arise due to wiggly string even at earlier stages when string moves through the relativistic plasma , even with @xmath80 for the wiggly string . if we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , then @xmath80 is subsonic and no shock can form .",
    "however , this does not represent the actual physical situation .",
    "this is because at smaller distance scales ( compared to the scale of the wiggles ) , the straight segments of the string move with @xmath81 ( ref .",
    "this is supersonic motion and shock will form .",
    "due to random velocities of different segments of the string , the individual shocks will combine to give some resultant shock and hence , wake for the total length of the ( wiggly ) string .",
    "thus we will assume that even with the wiggles , shock and wake formation results .",
    "for these wakes we will use eq.(12 ) with @xmath82 and mass per unit length @xmath39 for the straight string ( as individual segments are straight ) .",
    "however , now the length scale of the shock ( wake ) will be governed by the size of each straight segment .",
    "the length of the wake ( in the direction away from the string ) will still be governed by the average inter - string separation . that will not be affected by the presence of the wiggles .",
    "( recently , the evolution of wiggly string network has been studied @xcite on flat space - time .",
    "the results suggest that even in the presence of wiggles the string network obey scaling solution .",
    "authors in ref.@xcite also mentioned that the average inter - string separation also scales with time . though above simulation has been done on flat space - time",
    ", the author believes that such scaling solution is expected to exhibit in expanding universe also .",
    "if this is the case , then on an average inter - string separation for long wiggly string will not be altered from the straight string case . )",
    "however , the width of the wake ( along the string direction ) will now be truncated down to the average size of individual straight segment .",
    "note however that , this simply changes the geometry of a planar wake ( for a completely straight string ) to a collection of strips with each strip corresponding to individual straight segment of the wiggly string .",
    "even the geometry of these strips may not be planar due to rapidly changing velocity of string segments . for a correct treatment",
    ", one should properly account for the different velocity and orientations of these strips , however , for present we will ignore these complications . following eq.(12 ) , the opening angle of the wake and density fluctuation for each straight segment of the wiggly string can now be written as ( using @xmath83 and sound velocity @xmath55 ) ,    @xmath84    as the individual shock will combine to give resultant shock , we expect that the overall volume of the wakes will remain same ( upto some factor ) as for straight string case . here , we should again emphasizing that the above value of density fluctuation and opening angle of the wake ( i.e. , eq.(16 ) ) is derived from eq.(12 ) , where it is assumed that the fluid flow to be uniform . in reality , due to the wiggliness of the string the fluid will experience the rapidly changing directions of the wiggles which causes acceleration of the fluid in different direction .",
    "so , in proper treatment of shock formation by wiggly string , one should take the non - uniformity nature of the fluid in the analysis .",
    "however , due to lack of such complicated proper analysis , we will use ( mainly ) eq .",
    "( 12 ) and eq.(16 ) and discuss the effect of such fluctuations on qcd phase transition .",
    "here , we will first briefly discuss the dynamics of qcd phase transition in the context of early universe . in the conventional scenario of first order phase transition",
    ", the transition happens through the nucleation of hadronic bubble in the qgp background .",
    "these bubbles then grow , coalesce and finally convert the whole qgp phase into hadronic phase .",
    "however , since the critical size of the bubble beyond which it can grow is quite large at the temperature closed to @xmath16 and also the nucleation rate too small at such temperatures , universe has to supercool to a temperature @xmath85 to begin the nucleation process .",
    "the amount of supercooling @xmath86 depends on the surface tension @xmath87 and the latent heat @xmath88 .",
    "we take sample values of these parameters as obtained from the lattice results @xcite , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . as we discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for smaller value of surface tension our results remain applicable as the supercooling would be smaller ( as has been argued in the literature @xcite , see also ref . @xcite . ) and cosmic string induced density fluctuations will have more prominent effect on the dynamics of quark - hadron transition . taking the values of these parameters",
    "one can estimate the amount of supercooling to be @xcite    @xmath91    for critical temperature @xmath63 mev .",
    "+ as soon as the universe supercool down to temperature @xmath85 , hadronic bubbles will start nucleating in the background of quark gluon plasma phases .",
    "the duration of this nucleation process is very small and lasts only for a temperature range of @xmath92 , for a time duration of order @xmath93 ( @xmath94 is the hubble time ) .",
    "the bubbles which have already been nucleated will keep expanding and it will release latent heat which will prevent further nucleation process .",
    "after the nucleation processes stop , the universe enters into the so called slow combustion phases @xcite .",
    "however , in our model @xcite this slow combustion phase is very different from the standard scenario . here",
    "the phase transitions happens in the presence of density fluctuations ( which will transform into temperature fluctuations ) which is produced as the string passes through the relativistic plasma . in this scenario ,",
    "as we discuss below , the hadronization inside the wake will be delayed while outside the wake the universe will enter into slow combustion phases . to understand this slow combustion phase in our model we take density fluctuation from eq.(13 ) , which will transform into temperature fluctuation of magnitude @xmath95 . since , this temperature fluctuation is larger than @xmath96 , there will be no nucleation inside the wake while nucleation process will get completed outside the wake .",
    "thus , the region outside the wake will enter into slow combustion phase , while overdensity region will till remain in qgp phase . for this , the overdensity in the wake should not decrease in the time scale @xmath97 . to calculate the time scale @xmath98 of the evolution of the overdensity we take the typical average thickness of the wake as ,    @xmath99    where , @xmath100 km is the horizon size at @xmath16 = 150 mev .",
    "( note , as we have discussed earlier , the shock parameters of eq.(16 ) apply only for a straight segment of the string .",
    "however , the resulting wake may still extend upto typical inter - string separation .",
    "thus the overall volume covered by the wakes of different segments of wiggly string could be of same order as that of a wake from a straight string .",
    "we take this to be the case . ) now , typical time scale for the evolution of the overdensity will be governed by the sound speed @xmath50 .",
    "we take @xmath101 suitable at temperature closed to @xmath16 ( see ref .",
    "thus , we get the time scale as ,    @xmath102    which is large compared to the duration of the nucleation process @xmath93 .",
    "it is also much larger than @xmath103 during which the quark phase is completely converted to the hadronic phase in the region outside the wake .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the region outside the wake enters the slow combustion phase before any significant bubble nucleation can take place in the wake region .",
    "heat released by the bubbles outside the wakes will prevent bubble nucleation everywhere .",
    "it is then possible that the region outside the wakes will be converted to the hadronic phase while inside the wakes qgp phase remains .",
    "further completion of the phase transition will happen when the interfaces , seperating the qgp phase inside the wakes from the outside hadronic regions , move inward from the wake boundaries .",
    "these moving , macroscopic , interfaces may trap most of the baryon number in the entire region of the wake ( and some neighborhood ) towards the inner region of the wake .",
    "finally the interfaces will merge , completing the phase transition , and leading to a sheet of very large baryon number density , extending across the horizon .",
    "detailed profile of baryon inhomogeneities produced through these collapsing interface had been estimated in our previous work @xcite .    here , we want to discuss the mechanism of axions which will get trapped initially inside the wake and subsequently leave after acquiring required momentum form the collapsing walls . for that we will concentrate on a single wake like overdensity region .",
    "typical average volume of such region will be governed by the total number of long strings in a given horizon . from numerical simulation",
    "@xcite , the number of long strings is expected to be about 15 .",
    "( as is mentioned earlier , simulation @xcite on wiggly string network suggests that even in the presence of wiggles on long string , the network obey scaling solution .",
    "though above simulation has been done on flat space - time , the author believes that such scaling solution is expected to exhibit in expanding universe also . if this is the case , then the number of long strings as we have taken for straight string case will remain applicable even for wiggly string also . )",
    "if the string wakes are reasonably parallel , then they will span most of the horizon volume , as the average thickness of a wake will be order of 1 - 2 km .",
    "in such a situation , the hadronic phase will first appear in the regions between the wakes , which may cover a very small fraction of the horizon volume initially .",
    "if @xmath104 be the volume fraction occupied by the qgp phase then the initial value of this fraction @xmath104 will be close to 1 .",
    "@xmath104 will then slowly decrease to zero as the planar interfaces ( formed by the coalescence of bubbles in the region in between the overdense wakes ) move inward , converting the qgp region inside the wake into the hadronic phase .",
    "certainly , the actual situation will be more complicated than this , with string wakes extending in random directions , and often even overlapping .",
    "in such a situation , even the initial value of @xmath104 , when bubble coalescence ( in the regions between the wakes ) forming planar interfaces , may be smaller than 1 . note that , for wiggly string case , the wakes formed by straight segments of the string will have different orientations depending on the direction of each straight segment .",
    "in this situation , distribution of string wakes will be even more complicated , hence in determining the exact initial value of @xmath104 .",
    "however , for simplicity , we will take the initial value of @xmath104 to be almost 1 as is done in ref .",
    "@xcite and focus on the region relevant for only one string , covering about 1/15 of the horizon volume .",
    "also , as our main focus in this work is an order of magnitude estimate of iso - curvature fluctuations and since underline physical picture will remain same even for wiggly string , hence from now onwards , we only consider the case of straight string and the results will be quoted only for straight string case .",
    "we now study the density evolution of axions which may get trapped initially inside the wake .",
    "for that , let us first recall the effect of expansion of the universe on the dynamics of the phase transition .",
    "for that we mostly follow the work of fuller @xcite ( see also , @xcite ) who have studied the density evolution of baryons inside the shrinking qgp bubbles .",
    "if @xmath105 is the scale factor of robertson - walker metric , then einstein s equations give @xcite ,    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the average energy density of the mixed phase and given by ,    @xmath108    the energy density , pressure ( @xmath109 ) in the qgp phase and in the hadronic phase(@xmath110 ) are given by ,    @xmath111    here @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the degrees of freedom relevant for the two phases respectively ( taking two massless quark flavors in the qgp phase , and counting other light particles ) @xcite and @xmath114 . at the transition temperature we have @xmath115 which relates @xmath16 and the bag constant @xmath116 as , @xmath117 .",
    "we define @xmath118 to be the ratio of degrees of freedom between the two phases . with this , eq.(20 )",

    "therefore , eq.(25 ) can be rewritten as ,    @xmath123    these two equations , eq.(24 ) and eq.(26 ) have to be solved simultaneously to determine the evolution of scale factor and the change of @xmath104 , the volume fraction of qgp region as the transition proceeds .",
    "the initial time ( @xmath124 ) relevant for us is when the overdensity inside the wake has been formed .",
    "taking 15 long string inside the horizon at that epoch , we will consider the initial volume as ,    @xmath125    where @xmath126 is the size of the horizon at time @xmath124 .",
    "note that we take the wake like overdense regions to be well formed at time @xmath124 .",
    "thus our representative volume as the transition proceeds is , @xmath127 , @xmath128 being the scale factor at @xmath124 . taking center of the wake as the origin and considering motion of the interface along @xmath129 direction , we can write    @xmath130    where , @xmath131 is the area of each sheet .",
    "assuming the sheet extending across the horizon , we get the area as a function of time as , @xmath132 . putting this value we get the evolution of the thickness @xmath133 as ,    @xmath134    note that we are approximating the wake as bounded by two parallel sheets separated by average thickness of the wedge .",
    "now let us determine the effect of interface motion on axion momentum distribution and subsequently on the evolution of number density of axions inside the wake .",
    "total number of axions which will remain initially inside the wake can be calculated by integrating eq.(10 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath135 be the total number of axions trapped initially inside the wake , then ,    @xmath136    where the last factor @xmath137 is due to the decrease of axion density from time @xmath25 to @xmath124 causes by the expansion of the universe ( @xmath138 as given in eq.(10 ) gives the number density of axions at time @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xmath139 and @xmath140 are minimum and maximum comoving momentum respectively .",
    "since , the minimum comoving momentum which can be trapped initially inside the wake can not be smaller than @xmath141 , ( @xmath142 is the initial average thickness of the wake ) we will take @xmath139 as @xmath143 or @xmath144 whichever is larger . to determine that , we take the ratio ,    @xmath145    taking @xmath25 from eq.(9 ) , @xmath124 as @xmath146 and the initial thickness @xmath147 km or so , we get the ratio of @xmath148 .",
    "so , we take the minimum comoving momentum @xmath139 as @xmath32 .",
    "the maximum comoving momentum @xmath140 of the axions which will remain inside the wake can be set as discussed below .",
    "+ the momentum of the axions will keep increasing with the collapsing interfaces @xcite . thus ,",
    "if @xmath149 be the comoving momentum of an axion whose initial momentum is @xmath150 , then the momentum at any time t , when thickness of the wake becomes @xmath133 can be obtained from the following relation ,    @xmath151    the minimum physical momentum required for the axions to leave the interface is equal to @xmath152 ( see , eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the axions which have comoving momentum less than @xmath153 will remain inside the wake .",
    "thus , we can put the upper limit of the integration in eq.(30 ) as , @xmath31 or @xmath153 whichever is smaller . to determine that let us again calculate the ratio ,    @xmath154    putting the value of @xmath152 as obtained from eq.(6 ) and eq.(7 ) and the value of @xmath11 from eq.(4 ) the ratio can be determined in terms of the formation scale of axionic strings as ,    @xmath155    thus , the above ratio depends on the formation scale @xmath7 of the axionic string , which is constrained by the terrestrial and astrophysical experiments as well as from the cosmological considerations .",
    "the most stringent lower bound has been obtained from the sn 1987a @xcite as @xmath156 and the upper bound @xcite ( @xmath157 ) comes from the consideration that the axions should not overclose the universe .",
    "if we take @xmath158 , then the above ratio is always less than unity . in this case",
    "we can take the upper limit of integration in eq.(30 ) as @xmath31 .",
    "having set the limits of integration we can now calculate total number of axions which will remain initially inside the wake and given by ,    @xmath159 ( { r(\\tilde t ) \\over r_0})^3\\ ] ]    where , @xmath160 @xmath161 .",
    "now as the interfaces move towards each other momentum of each axion will be modified according to eq.(32 ) .",
    "let @xmath162 be the modified spectrum due to trapping of axions within the collapsing walls when thickness becomes @xmath133 .",
    "unless the momentum of each axion becomes @xmath163 the axions will remain inside the wake .",
    "so upto certain time @xmath164 , total number of axions @xmath165 ( for @xmath166 ) will remain fixed inside the wake . subsequently , number density will be increased due to decrease of volume fraction of qgp region @xmath104 caused by interface motion .",
    "so , total number of axions at certain time @xmath167 can be written as ,    @xmath168    where , @xmath169 is new coefficient will be determined in terms of f. this coefficient @xmath169 essentially will take care of the change of the coefficient f due to shifting of momentum of each axion as is obtained from eq.(32 ) and the change in qgp volume causes by interface motion . determining this coefficient in terms f will be particularly useful in determining the evolution of axion density when axions will start leaking out the overdensity regions .",
    "+ @xmath170 = @xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath173 ( say ) and @xmath174 , @xmath175 have to be substituted by @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively . substituting all these quantities and integrating eq.(36 )",
    "we get the total number of axions at any intermediate time between @xmath124 to @xmath164 . equating this number to the initial total number of axions at @xmath124 as obtained from eq.(35 )",
    "one gets the coefficients @xmath178 as follows ,    @xmath179    putting back @xmath169 in eq.(36 ) and divided by the qgp volume @xmath180 we get the number density of axions upto time @xmath164 and given by ,    @xmath181 = { 3 \\over { 32 \\pi } } { { v_0 \\eta_a ^2 } \\over { f v(t)t_0 ^ 2}}ln(\\eta_a \\tilde t ) [ { ( \\tilde t t_0)}^{1/2}- { ( t _ * t_0)}^{1/2}]\\ ] ]    now , as we mentioned earlier that the density written above is applicable upto time @xmath164 below which no axions will leave the qgp regions due to insufficient momentum required to escape the region .",
    "the thickness of the wake at that time @xmath164 can be calculated using the fact that when the momentum of axion exceeds the value @xmath163 they will leave the wake region , which is first happens when @xmath177 becomes equal to @xmath163 . using this equality we get the corresponding thickness at @xmath164 and determined by ,    @xmath182    or ,    @xmath183    since",
    ", the initial thickness @xmath142 of the wake is @xmath184 km , and @xmath185 , thickness of the wake at time @xmath164 comes out to be @xmath186 @xmath187 for string formation scale @xmath188 .",
    "as soon as the thickness decreases down to @xmath187 , the axions will start leaving the qgp region and finally all the axions will leave the wake and form a sheet like structure . to determine the evolution of density after @xmath164 , upper and lower limit of the integration of eq.(36 ) should be replaced by @xmath163 and @xmath176 respectively .",

    "@xmath190 is the final time at which all the axions will leave the qgp region .",
    "the corresponding thickness can be obtained from the following expression ,    @xmath191    so , the ratio of the final thickness when no axion will remain inside to the initial thickness becomes ,    @xmath192    since , the time scale ( @xmath193 ) at the onset of qcd phase transition is of same order of magnitude as our initial time @xmath124 , which is of the order of @xmath146 we get the ratio of final thickness to the initial thickness as @xmath194 for string formation scale @xmath195 .",
    "therefore when the wake inside which axions were trapped reduced to a size of about @xmath196 , the axions which were still remained inside the wake will all leave the wake and form a sheet like region .",
    "the release of the axions from the wake thus happens for the duration when wake thickness lies between 2 @xmath197 and 0.1 @xmath198 .",
    "below the thickness of 0.1 @xmath198 , no axion will remain inside the wakes .",
    "the axions thus left behind as the interfaces collapse will be concentrated in a sheet like regions .",
    "one can calculate the density profile of these axions as follows .",
    "+ let , @xmath199 be the density of axions which is left behind at position z as the interfaces collapse .",
    "then we can write down the following expression which relates total number of axions at position @xmath129 to the density which are left behind as follows ,    @xmath200    where the time dependence of @xmath129 is given in eq.(29 ) .",
    "so we get ,    @xmath201    thus we finally get the density profile of axions as a function of thickness with collapsing interfaces as ,    @xmath202    however , here we should mention that in deriving the above equation we have considered that the axions will not disperse away immediately as it leaves the wake . strictly speaking , the axions after leaving",
    "the wake will move with a velocity corresponding to the momentum they have in the hadronic phase , as they leave the wake . since axions leave as soon as their momentum in the qgp phase equals the mass difference @xmath152 ( eq.(1 ) )",
    ", their kinetic energy may not be large in the hadronic phase .",
    "hence they may not move very far from the wake ( note , axions are very weakly interacting ) . in this case",
    ", the density will be somewhat decreased compare to the density as obtained from the eq.(47 ) .",
    "however the order of magnitude may not be changed much .",
    "so for simplicity we will consider the case where the axions will not be homogenized immediately after leaving the wake . in the following section we will discuss the results as is obtained from eq.(36 ) , eq.(38 ) and eq.(47 ) .",
    "eq.(24),(26 ) are solved numerically to get the evolution of scale factor and volume fraction @xmath104 which is occupied by the qgp phase .",
