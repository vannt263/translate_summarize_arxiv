    "<S> tetra - quark mesons with exotic quantum numbers and their production rates are studied .    </S>",
    "<S> tetra - quark mesons can be classified into the following four groups  @xcite ( and ) , @xmath0[\\bar q\\bar q ] \\oplus ( qq)(\\bar q\\bar q )    \\oplus \\{[qq](\\bar q\\bar q)\\oplus ( qq)[\\bar q\\bar q]\\ }                                                      \\label{eq:4-quark } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) , where parentheses and square brackets denote symmetry and anti - symmetry , respectively , of flavor wavefunctions ( wfs . ) under exchange of flavors between them . </S>",
    "<S> each term in the right - hand - side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:4-quark ] ) is again classified into two groups with @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the color @xmath5  @xcite . in the case of heavy mesons , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 state is taken as the ( dominant part of ) lower lying one  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , spin ( @xmath6 ) and parity ( @xmath7 ) of corresponding @xmath8[\\bar q\\bar q]$ ] and @xmath8(\\bar q\\bar q)\\pm ( qq)[\\bar q\\bar q]$ ] mesons are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , we ignore @xmath11  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , although still controversial  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of candidates of heavy tetra - quark mesons is @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> it was discovered in the @xmath13 mass distribution , while no signal in the @xmath14 channel in inclusive @xmath15 annihilation  . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests that the decay @xmath16 is dominant and caused by the isospin conserving strong interaction , because of the well - known hierarchy of hadron interactions  @xcite , @xmath17_isospin conserving strong ones_@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath17_electromagnetic ones_@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath17_isospin non - conserving ones_@xmath17 . here </S>",
    "<S> the last one is of the order of @xmath19  @xcite , where @xmath19 is the fine structure constant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath12 should be an iso - triplet state , and hence it is natural to assign @xmath12 to @xmath20[\\bar s\\bar n]_{i=1},\\,(n = u,\\,d)$ ]  . in this case , the observed narrow width  @xcite of @xmath12 is understood by a small overlap of color and spin wfs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above assignment is consistent  @xcite with the observation in @xmath21 decays  , @xmath22 ) =   ( 8.5^{{+}2.1}_{{-}1.9 } { \\pm } 2.6)\\times 10^{-4}$ ] and @xmath23 ) }                                    { \\,\\,=(2.5^{{+}2.0}_{{-}1.8 } ( { < } 7.5))\\times 10^{-4}}$ ] , where signals observed in the @xmath13 and @xmath14 are denoted as @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath26 and its iso - singlet partner @xmath27[\\bar s\\bar n]_{i=0}$ ] are identified with @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] , respectively , because the former decays dominantly into the @xmath13 state while the latter into the @xmath14 due to the above hierarchy of hadron interactions . for more details , </S>",
    "<S> see refs .  , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another candidate of tetra - quark meson is @xmath28 with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the charge conjugation parity . </S>",
    "<S> it was discovered  @xcite and confirmed  @xcite in the @xmath31 mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath32 decay violates badly isospin conservation  @xcite which works well in ordinary strong interactions . </S>",
    "<S> such a large violation of isospin symmetry can be understood  @xcite by the @xmath33 mixing which is well - known as the origin of isospin non - conservation in nuclear forces  @xcite , because the @xmath34 pole contribution is enhanced in the @xmath32 decay due to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the measured values of the ratio of decay rates @xmath36 have been approximately reproduced , i.e. , @xmath37  @xcite , by assuming that @xmath28 is a tetra - quark system like a @xmath38(\\bar c\\bar n ) + ( cn)[\\bar c\\bar n]\\}_{i=0}$ ] meson  @xcite ( or a @xmath39 molecule  @xcite ) and that the isospin non - conservation under consideration is caused by the @xmath33 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if @xmath28 were assumed to be a charmonium @xmath40 with @xmath41 , the above ratio could not be reproduced , i.e. , @xmath42  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have seen that a tetra - quark interpretation of @xmath28 is favored over the charmonium . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , production  @xcite of the _ prompt _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 seems to favor a compact object like a tetra - quark meson over an extended object like a loosely bound molecule  @xcite , and hence the tetra - quark model mentioned above survives while the @xmath39 molecular model would be ruled out .    </S>",
    "<S> although quantum numbers of @xmath12 and @xmath28 are not exotic , their tetra - quark interpretation has been favored by experiments as seen above , so that existence of their partners with exotic quantum numbers is expected . </S>",
    "<S> however , for example , neutral and doubly charged partners , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , of @xmath45 have not been observed in inclusive @xmath15 annihilation  . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it does not necessarily imply their non - existence but it might suggest that their production is suppressed in this process . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by considering their production in the framework of minimal @xmath46 pair creation  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> their production rates in @xmath21 decays have been very crudely estimated as @xmath47 , because the above decays are described by the same type of quark - line diagrams and hence the sizes of their amplitudes are expected to be nearly equal to each other  .    </S>",
    "<S> observations of mesons with exotic quantum number(s ) provide additional evidences for existence of tetra - quark mesons . in our scheme , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48[\\bar u\\bar d]$ ] meson   is only one scalar meson with @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> axial - vector mesons with exotic quantum numbers , which come from @xmath50(\\bar q\\bar q)\\oplus ( qq)[\\bar q\\bar q]\\}$ ] , are @xmath51 $ ] with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ; @xmath55 $ ] with @xmath52 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ; @xmath58 $ ] with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath54 ; @xmath61}\\sim [ cs](\\bar n\\bar n)$ ] with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> their masses can be very crudely estimated as @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 gev , @xmath65 gev , @xmath66}}\\simeq 2.97 $ ] gev by using a quark counting with @xmath67 gev and @xmath68 gev as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where @xmath69 mev and @xmath70 mev have been taken as the input data . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that we have predicted  @xcite the mass of hidden - charm iso - triplet scalar @xmath71 to be @xmath72 gev , using the same quark counting , and that the result fits much better to a peak at @xmath73 gev in the @xmath74 channel , which was observed by the belle  @xcite and can be considered as a signal of @xmath71 , than predictions of the corresponding meson mass by the other models  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> production of tetra - quark mesons is now in order . </S>",
    "<S> productions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be described by the quark - line diagram , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) , which is of the same type as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) in ref .   describing @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath79 as mentioned before , production rates for @xmath75 and @xmath76 would be very crudely estimated as @xmath80 because differences of kinematics between @xmath81 and @xmath82 decays under consideration do not change order of magnitude of their branching fractions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> production of @xmath83 is described by the diagram fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) which describes the ckm suppressed decay , so that the rate for @xmath83 production would be more suppressed by a factor @xmath84 than the above ones , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the ckm matrix elements , although it is described by the same type of diagram as the previous ones . </S>",
    "<S> productions of scalar and axial - vector tetra - quark mesons with @xmath87 can be described by the diagrams , ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> . these diagrams are of the same type as that of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) in ref .   describing @xmath88 whose rate has already been measured  . </S>",
    "<S> however , the result is smaller by about an order of magnitude than @xmath89 because the former includes an @xmath90 pair creation , as discussed in refs .   and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we now expect that rates for decays described by the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 are not suppressed , because these diagrams involve no @xmath90 creation , i.e. , @xmath91 } )   \\sim br ( b_u^-\\rightarrow d^-\\hat e^0 )        \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sim br(\\bar b_d^0\\rightarrow \\bar d^{*0}e^0_{a(cs ) } ) \\sim br(\\bar b_d^0\\rightarrow \\bar d^{*0}e^0_{a[cs ] } ) \\sim br(\\bar b_d^0\\rightarrow \\bar d^0\\hat e^0 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sim 10\\times   br(\\bar b_d^0\\rightarrow k^-d_{s0}^+(2317))\\sim 10^{-(4 - 3)}.                                                                              \\label{eq : rates - for - e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although decay properties of these exotic mesons would be useful to search for them , rates for two- and body - decays of , in particular , @xmath92 and @xmath93 would be crucially sensitive to their mass values because they are estimated to be very close to their corresponding thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , calculations of these rates would be keenly model dependent at the present stage . in addition , no experimental data which can be used as the input data is known , so that they are left as one of our future subjects .        in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied scalar and axial - vector mesons with exotic quantum numbers , and have estimated their production rates , comparing quark - line diagrams describing their productions with those of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> as the result , we have seen that a major part of them can be large enough to be observed in @xmath21 decays . </S>"
