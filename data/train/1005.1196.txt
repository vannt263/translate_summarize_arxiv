    "( ii ) the spectral signature shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : midenergyexampleofmethod ] can only be recognized well after a long exposure of a source being in a flare state .",
    "the data of the mkn501 flare from 1997 used for the study remains unique so far .",
    "this means that it can not be expected that a study with such precision can be done on many sources with future ngcts .",
    "still , the indirect ebl measurement based on few strong flares will be of high importance .",
    "( iii ) the limited energy resolution of iacts ( @xmath3110% ) could affect the possibility of detecting such a signature .",
    "the overall shape of the attenuation effect is broad enough in energy to not strongly be affected by the smoothing of an energy resolution of @xmath46% . for nearby sources , however , the wiggle structure produced by the wrongly assumed ebl model is only of order of a few per cent of the total flux level .",
    "an additional spread introduced by the spill - over effects due to events with mis - reconstructed energy may enhance or alter the wiggles .",
    "therefore , an efficient and precise spectral unfolding technique will be key to overcome these problems for nearby sources . for more distant sources",

    "overall the two methods show promising results , clearly go beyond what is possible with current generation instruments .",
