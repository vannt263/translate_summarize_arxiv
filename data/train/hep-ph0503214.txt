    "observation of particle spin rotation and spin dichroism ( birefringence effect ) with a storage ring requires reducing of @xmath2 precession frequency ( @xmath3 is the gyromagnetic ratio ) .",

    "according to @xcite balancing the energy of the particle and the strength of the electric field in a storage ring provides to reduce and even zeroize the @xmath2 precession frequency . as a result , the edm - caused spin rotation grows linearly with time @xcite .",

    "the effect of deuteron ( nucleus ) birefringence in a medium reveals itself in a storage ring due to presence of the residual gas inside the storage ring and use of a gas jet ( gas target ) for deuteron ( nucleus ) polarization analysis .",
    "moreover , the birefringence also occurs in a solid target used for analysis of polarization of the deuteron ( nucleus ) beam outside the storage ring .",

    "in addition , study of the birefringence phenomenon is of self - importance since it makes possible to measure the spin - depended part of the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "lastly , the action of the electric field on the deuteron rouses one more mechanism of deuteron spin rotation and oscillations ( the phenomenon of birefringence in an electric field ) conditioned by the deuteron tensor electric polarizability @xcite .    in this paper the deuteron birefringence in a matter and in an electric field is considered for a particle moving in a storage ring .",
