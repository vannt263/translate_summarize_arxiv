    "during the recent years there has been considerable progress in modelling of bulk matter dynamics in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the state - of - the - art theoretical descriptions are based on viscous hydrodynamics coupled to a hadron cascade .",
    "they successfully describe bulk observables such as radial flow , elliptic and higher order flow harmonics @xcite , femtoscopy @xcite etc .",
    "the idea of the present study is to apply a hybrid ( or hydro+cascade ) model to heavy ion collisions at lower collision energies to study how well the model can describe the existing data from cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and recent results from beam energy scan program at rhic .",
    "the lower the collision energy , the worse the approximation of boost - invariant scaling flow is .",
    "thus it is important to employ initial conditions with non - trivial rapidity dependence .",
    "we use the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model @xcite for the description of initial stage dynamics .",
    "the two nuclei are initialized according to wood - saxon distributions and the binary interactions are taken into account until a hypersurface at constant @xmath3 .",
    "we average over many urqmd events to get smooth distribution of particles . the energy and momentum of particles",
    "is then converted to energy and momentum densities of the fluid .",
    "in addition to energy / momentum densities , initial baryon and charge densities are non - zero and obtained from urqmd , evolved in the hydro stage and accounted for in the particlization procedure . on the other hand , net strangeness density",
    "is set to zero .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are solved in milne ( @xmath4 ) coordinates .",
    "the starting time of hydrodynamic evolution is chosen to be @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a radius of nucleus and @xmath7 is a nucleon mass .",
    "this corresponds to the time when the two nuclei have passed through each other .    for beam energy scan ,",
    "an equation of state ( eos ) for finite baryon density must be used .",
    "we employ the chiral model based eos @xcite , which features correct asymptotic degrees of freedom , i.e.  quarks and gluons at high temperature and hadrons in the low - temperature limits , crossover - type transition between confined and deconfined matter for all values of @xmath8 and qualitatively agrees with lattice qcd data at @xmath9 .",
    "the hydrodynamic code used solves the equations of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in israel - stewart framework @xcite . in particular",
    "we solve the following equations for the shear stress tensor : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes covariant derivative and the brackets @xmath12 denote the symmetric , traceless and orthogonal to @xmath13 part of @xmath14 . for the purpose of the current study",
    "we consider only the effects of shear viscosity , fixing bulk viscosity to zero , @xmath15 .",
    "we do not include the baryon / electric charge diffusion either . for viscous hydro simulations ,",
    "we initialize the shear stress tensor to zero . the relaxation time for shear , @xmath16 ,",
    "is taken as @xmath17 .",
    "the transition from fluid to particle description ( so - called particlization ) is made at the constant energy density @xmath18  gev/@xmath19 when the medium has already hadronized ( as in previous studies at @xmath20 a gev rhic and lhc energies @xcite ) .",
    "cornelius subroutine @xcite is used to calculate the 3-volume elements @xmath21 of the transition hypersurface .",
    "it is important to note that while we use fixed energy density as transition criterion for all collision energies , the value of net baryon density on this surface is non - uniform and its average increases with decreasing collision energy .",
    "this corresponds to the increase of average temperature and decrease of baryon chemical potential with increasing collision energy , resembling the results for the collision energy dependence of chemical freezeout parameters from thermal model studies @xcite .",
    "also , since chiral eos deviates from free hadron - resonance gas ( hrg ) in hadronic phase , we switch to free hrg eos when sampling the particles according to cooper - frye prescription .",
    "we recalculate the energy density , pressure , flow velocity and corresponding thermodynamical quantities from energy - momentum tensor using free hrg eos , and employ them when sampling .",
    "finally , we use the same corrections to the local equilibrium distribution functions for all hadron species : @xmath22\\ ] ]    the scatterings and decays happening after particlization are then treated with urqmd code .",
    "first we simulate pb - pb collisions at energies @xmath23 and @xmath24  a  gev ( i.e.  @xmath25  gev ) , and compare @xmath0 and @xmath26 distributions with the data from na49 collaboration .",
    "note that the only variable parameter is the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath27 in hydro stage , with the other parameters fixed as described above .    with a given criterion for fluid to particle transition , the duration of hydro phase decreases from about 6.5 fm / c ( at @xmath28  gev ) to just about 4.5 fm / c ( at @xmath29  gev ) , while the duration of pre - hydrodynamic stage increases according to the eq .",
    "[ tstart ] .",
    "consequently , at the lowest sps energy ( @xmath29  gev ) the lifetimes of pre - hydro ( 4.1 fm / c ) and hydro stages are comparable .",
    "rapidity distributions for @xmath30,@xmath31 and @xmath32 for pb - pb collisions at @xmath33 and @xmath34 a gev ( corresponding to @xmath28 and @xmath35 gev ) .",
    "model calculations are compared to na49 data @xcite , title=\"fig : \" ] rapidity distributions for @xmath30,@xmath31 and @xmath32 for pb - pb collisions at @xmath33 and @xmath34 a gev ( corresponding to @xmath28 and @xmath35 gev ) .",
    "model calculations are compared to na49 data @xcite , title=\"fig : \" ] +    in the case of zero shear viscosity in hydro phase we underestimate the particle yields and radial flow at midrapidity .",
    "however , the inclusion of shear viscosity in hydro phase increases the yields at midrapidity due to viscous entropy production , see fig .",
    "[ figdndy ] .",
    "one can see that shear viscosity makes the @xmath26 profile narrower .",
    "the longitudinal expansion is weaker , and the expansion tends to be more spherical , as seen in the comparison of the @xmath36-spectra , fig . [ figpt ] : @xmath36-spectra become flatter , which is due to stronger transverse expansion and larger radial flow .",

    "so one can conclude that a consistent description of @xmath46 , @xmath26 , and @xmath36-spectra requires a value of @xmath27 which is somewhat larger than @xmath45 , especially for lower energy points .",
