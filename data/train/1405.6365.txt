    "understanding the long time dynamics of a non - equilibrium one dimensional system is a difficult task .",
    "the initial state is not a eigenstate of the effective hamiltonian but a complex superposition of such states .",
    "as such the final state of the system does not depend on some eigenstate and a few excitations but on a coherent superposition of various states . if one wants to understand the emergence of a steady state one needs to track the evolution of this coherent sum of states .",
    "this is the problem that confronts theorists who wish to understand perturbed quantum gases @xcite , ultrafast phenomena in superconductors @xcite and thermalization in integrable systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most surprising recent experimental and theoretical results is that at long times the perturbed lieb - liniger gas @xcite retains memory of its initial state @xcite and does not appear to relax to thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this is due to the fact that the lieb liniger hamiltonian : @xmath0 has an infinite number of conserved charges @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the bosonic creation operator at the point @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the coupling constant which in this work we will take to infinity .",
    "these conserved quantities in turn imply that there is a complete system of eigenstates for the lieb liniger gas which may be parametrized by sets of rapidities @xmath5 . to understand the equilibration of this gas it was recently proposed that it is insufficient to consider only thermal ensembles but it is also necessary to include these nontrivial conserved quantities .",
    "it was shown that the gas relaxes to a state given by the generalized gibbs ensemble gge with its density matrix being given by @xmath6    where the @xmath1 are the conserved quantities given by @xmath7 and the @xmath8 are the generalized inverse temperatures and @xmath9 is a normalization constant insuring @xmath10=1 $ ] .",
    "it was shown that correlation functions of the lieb - liniger gas at long times may be computed by taking their expectation value with respect to the gge density matrix , e.g. @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "it was also later shown @xcite that the the gge ensemble is equivalent to a pure state @xmath12 for an appropriately chosen @xmath13 .",
    "it is of great interest to provide some experimentally accessible signatures for the gge state , since most experimental signatures atleast in the cold gases context focus on measurement of correlation functions we will focus on these ; in particular we focus on the simplest non - trivial correlation function @xmath14 .",
    "colloquially speaking there are two approaches towards using spectroscopic signatures : 1 ) to determine the initial state with as great a precision as possible from its measurable observables 2 ) to determine which class of state it belongs to and to provide robust signatures of this type of state . in some sense",
    "the second goal is more fundamental , since the first presupposes knowledge of the second to some extend .",
    "furthermore the answer to the second question is usually universal so it is robust to experimental imperfections . as such it will be the focus of this work .",
    "the lieb liniger gas is initialized in some nonequilibrium state , allowed to relax for a long time and its correlation functions are measured . ]    in this work we consider the repulsive lieb - liniger model in the limit of infinite interaction strength , tonks girardeau limit .",
    "we consider the case when the gas was quenched from a non - equilibrium initial state @xmath15 - which must be translationally invariant and short ranged correlated - and allowed to relax for a long time thereby establishing a gge @xmath16 with @xmath17 see figure ( [ fig : trap_release ] ) . in this regime",
    "when the gge is already established we compute the density density correlation function of the gas and show that at long distances it is of universal form - exponentially decaying @xmath18 .",
    "this simple exponential decay is a clear spectroscopic signature of the gge . in the case",
    "when the initial state , and hence the final state , has low entropy per particle @xcite we find that at intermediate distances the density density correlation function has a universal form it is a power law decay @xmath19 , in particular the density density correlation function has three `` regions '' and looks like the one given in figure ( [ fig : density_density ] ) .",
    "furthermore for any specific initial state with low entropy the exact density density correlation function has a simple form depending only on the the set of points @xmath20 such that the energy function vanishes @xmath21 .",
    "the values @xmath20 are readily measurable experimentally through time of flight imaging and are related to rapid changes in the particle distribution function @xmath22 discussed below , see figure ( [ fig : quansimomentud_density ] ) .",
    "thus the density density correlation functions give a finger print signature that the gge has been established .",
    "we also study a generalized case valid when the initial state has long distance correlation functions @xcite and the final sate of the gas is controlled by a generalized gge .",
    "we find that for the case when the initial state has low entropy per particle that the long distance form of the density density correlation function still has a power law form .",
    "however the prefactor is a complicated @xmath23 non - universal function .",
    "we would like to note that the results pertaining to the exponential decay of correlations are based on the assumption that the function @xmath24 is analytic in the complex plane which would happen for example when the first few conserved quantities dominate the dynamics .",
    "the density density correlation function for the low entropy gge .",
    "there is a complicated short distance region , a power law decay @xmath19 and an exponential decay at long distances . ]",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : reduction - to - a ] we simplify the gge density matrix by reducing it to a single state @xmath12 ; in section [ sec : asymptotics - of - the ] we present a general from for the density density correlation function , we review the work done in @xcite ; in section [ sec : density - density - correlations ] we find the asymptotics of the density density correlation function at long times and large distances for an arbitrary initial state , we find an exponential decay of the correlation function ; in section [ sec : low - entropy - per ] we specialize to the case when there is low entropy per particle and find a power law decay of the density density correlation function at intermediate distances ; in section [ sec : bosonization ] based on the results of section [ sec : low - entropy - per ] we present a phenomenological bosonization theory for the density density correlations for the low entropy gge state ; in section [ sec : generalise - gge ] we extend our results to the ggge and in section [ sec : conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "the quasimomentum distribution function @xmath22 .",
    "the points @xmath20 are determined when @xmath25 , for the low entropy state these would correspond to rapid changes in the quasiparticle density from @xmath26 see section [ sec : low - entropy - per ] . ]",
    "for the lieb - liniger gas it is possible to reduce the gge density matrix to a pure state .",
    "in particular it was shown that the gge density matrix corresponds to a specific pure state @xcite : that is for any local correlation function @xmath27 : @xmath28=\\left\\langle \\vec{k}_{0}\\right|\\theta\\left|\\vec{k}_{0}\\right\\rangle \\label{eq : gge_state_equivalence}\\ ] ] for an appropriately chosen eigenstate of the lieb liniger hamiltonian @xmath13 . furthermore following the authors of @xcite we are able to specify this pure state @xmath13 .",
    "to do so let us denote by @xmath29 as the number of particles in the interval @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 as the number of holes in the interval @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath32 as the number of states in the interval @xmath30 $ ] so that @xmath33",
    ". then the density of particles in k - space corresponding to @xmath13 is given by the following equations @xcite : @xmath34    here @xmath35 and we have introduced @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the energy function of the gge ensemble and we denote the density of particles by @xmath38 . in the case of the tonks girardeau gas",
    "this relation between the gge density matrix and the state @xmath13 greatly simplifies . in this case density corresponding to the state @xmath39",
    "is given by @xmath40    from this it is possible to completely determine the density of particles corresponding to the gge density matrix , it is given by @xmath41 .",
    "we note that the density function @xmath22 is measurable experimentally .",
    "as a preliminary step to understand the density density correlation function we would like to study the generating function of density correlations @xmath42 .",
    "it is known @xcite that for a pure state @xmath13 the expectation value of @xmath43 is given by the fredholm determinant of the sine kernel with respect to the state : @xmath44    the only dependance on @xmath13 comes from @xmath45 . this fredholm determinant has been well studied and the large distance asymptotics of this determinant is given by @xcite:@xmath46 @xmath47    here we have introduced the functions @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . here @xmath52 , @xmath53 with @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 refer to the solutions of the equation @xmath56 with @xmath57 referring to solutions in the upper and lower half plane respectively .",
    "this complex formula gives all the density density correlation functions for the gge .",
    "we will study and simplify this formula in the remained of the paper .",
    "we note here that the number of solutions @xmath55 might be infinite however because of the form of @xmath58 only those near the real axis contribute to the correlation function @xmath59 so only a finite number of terms matter .",
    "corrections to this result , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : determinant_value ] ) decay faster then any exponential .",
    "we note that this result depends on @xmath60 being analytic in the complex plane , which would happen when the inverse temperatures @xmath8 converge fast enough .",
    "we would like to specialize the above formulas , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : determinant_value ] ) to the calculation of density density correlation functions . since @xmath61 it is sufficient to expand the above formulas for small @xmath62 upto order @xmath63 . with this in mind",
    "its sufficient to simplify @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . furthermore introducing @xmath67 as solutions to the equations @xmath68 closest to the points",
    "@xmath55 we have that @xmath69 and therefore @xmath46@xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "we note that the points @xmath67 correspond to poles of @xmath72 which are close to solutions of the equation @xmath73 for small @xmath62 . now using @xmath74 and combining",
    "we get that @xmath75    the last equality comes about because of every pole of @xmath76 so a pole at @xmath77 corresponds to a pole at @xmath78 . for very long distances only one of the exponentials dominates and we get that @xmath46 @xmath79    as such at long distances the density density correlation function for the tonks gas after it has reached equilibrium generically has a single exponential decay this result is robust to experimental imperfections .",
    "this result compares well with the quench between free bosons and hard core bosons studied in @xcite .",
    "we would like to note that there are some cases where due to symmetry there are exactly two degenerate minimal @xmath80 .",
    "this happens for example when @xmath81 . in this case",
    "there are two minimal solutions @xmath82 and @xmath83 . assuming that these are two distinct points , e.g. @xmath82 is not purely imaginary we obtain that : @xmath84 in this case , for a symmetric @xmath60 , we see that there is still an exponential decay but it is now multiplied by @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "this is an excellent spectroscopic tool to determine the gge as well as to test whether the density of excitations @xmath22 is symmetric @xmath87 or not .",
    "we note though that the coefficient @xmath88 is very hard to determine directly from a measurement of @xmath22 because it requires an analytic continuation of the function @xmath22 into the upper complex plane , it is measurable from interferometry density density correlation measurement though .",
    "below we shall see that in the case that the initial state has low entropy per particle for intermediate distance scales there is a different universal power law behavior for the correlation functions .",
    "we would like to consider the case where the final state has little entropy per particle , or equivalently its at a low `` temperature '' @xcite .",
    "we know that the entropy per unit length is given by @xmath89 .",
    "we see that this can only be small when either @xmath90 or @xmath91 are small . from this",
    "we see that @xmath92 for most @xmath60 and that @xmath80 has a large imaginary part except near specific values where @xmath93 . by considering the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : simplified_densitydensity ] ) we see that points with large imaginary values do not contribute so we focus on the case where @xmath94 . near such points @xmath95 . from this",

    "( [ eq : simplified_densitydensity ] ) we see that the sum in the absolute value is given by : @xmath102 . from this",
    "we get that for intermediate distances in the low entropy regime @xmath103 we note that this result is valid when there are many poles near the points @xmath20 or alternatively @xmath104 .",

    "we note that we have introduced a total of @xmath112 bosonic fields each corresponding to an appropriate pair of points @xmath20 and @xmath113 in the case of bosonizing the ground state this would correspond to one field representing the left and right fermi point .",
    "furthermore the simplest action for the fields @xmath110 may be written as @xcite : @xmath114    this corresponds to a sum of independent actions for each bose field .",
    "for simplicity we consider the zero temperature limit , it is the one that reproduces the power law decay functions .",
    "this allows us to compute the density density correlation function .",
    "it is given by : @xmath115    we hypothesize that this form with appropriate @xmath116 and @xmath117 is also valid for the lieb - liniger gas for intermediate distances when considering a gge with relatively little entropy per particle .",
    "we would like to note that this is only a conjecture and that there are many other ways to bosonize the gge lieb liniger gas , for example introduce a @xmath117 matrix and a @xmath116 matrix , however this is the simplest translationally invariant way that reduces to known results about bosonizing the ground state of the lieb liniger gas and given correct answers for the gge .",
    "recently it has been proposed that for states with long ranged correlation functions the lieb - liniger gas does not equilibrate to the gge but to a generalized version of it , the ggge @xcite .",
    "the density matrix for the ggge ensemble is given by @xmath118 .",

    "we would like to show that in the case of initial states with low entropy per particle the density density correlation function still retains its @xmath19 form .",

    "we considered the case where the gas has little entropy per particle and found that at intermediate distances the gas has a power law @xmath19 density density correlation function .",
    "we presented a bosonization hypothesis that allowed us to extend our results to the lieb liniger gas with finite interaction strength . in the future",
    "it would be interesting to confirm this hypothesis as well as compute other correlation functions .",
    "we note that our results provide clear spectroscopic signatures for identifying a gge using both the density function @xmath22 and the density density correlation function @xmath14 .",
    "in particular we show that in the low entropy per particle regime the density density correlation has three `` regions '' which should be easily measurable through interferometry .",
