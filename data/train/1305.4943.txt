    "therefore , the mass accretion rate @xmath20 at the jet launching stage should exceed the eddington mass accretion rate @xmath21 where @xmath4 is the light speed .",
    "subsequently , the x - ray luminosity of swift j1644 + 57 decreased as @xmath22 ( @xcite , but see also @xcite and @xcite ) , which can be explained by decrease of the mass supply rate @xmath5 from the stellar debris @xcite .",

    "more recently , @xcite predicted that jets and associated x - ray emission will be revived in 201622 when the continuous decrease of the accretion rate triggers the state transition from a high / soft state to a low / hard state , in which the radio emission from jets is observed in galactic microquasars @xcite .    in this letter",
