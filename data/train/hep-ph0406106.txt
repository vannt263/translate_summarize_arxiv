    "there has been a remarkable progress in the studies of neutrino oscillations in the last several years .",
    "the experiments with solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrinos  @xcite have provided compelling evidences for the existence of neutrino oscillations driven by nonzero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing .",
    "evidences for oscillations of neutrinos were obtained also in the first long baseline accelerator neutrino experiment k2k  @xcite .",
    "the latest addition to this magnificent effort is the evidence presented at this workshop by the super - kamiokande ( sk ) collaboration for an `` oscillation dip '' in the @xmath20dependence , of the ( essentially multi - gev ) @xmath1like atmospheric neutrino events  @xcite , @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the distance traveled by neutrinos and the neutrino energy .",
    "this beautiful result represents the first ever observation of a direct effect of the oscillatory dependence on @xmath23 of the probability of neutrino oscillations in vacuum .",
    "an improved analysis of sk atmospheric neutrino data , performed recently by the sk collaboration , gave  @xcite at 90% c.l .",
    "@xmath24 with best fit values @xmath25 ev@xmath18 and @xmath26 ( see also ref .",
    "earlier analysis of the sk atmospheric neutrino data produced somewhat larger values of @xmath27 : the best fit value found , e.g. , by sk collaboration  @xcite reads @xmath28 . finally , the values of @xmath27 and @xmath29 , deduced from the sk analysis of the @xmath23 dependence of the observed @xmath1like atmospheric neutrino events  @xcite , are compatible with the values obtained in the other analysis .    as is well - known ,",
    "the atmospheric neutrino and k2k data do not allow one to determine the signs of @xmath30 and of @xmath31 when @xmath32 .",
    "the two possibilities , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , correspond to two different types of neutrino mass spectrum : with normal hierarchy ( nh ) , @xmath33 , and with inverted hierarchy ( ih ) , @xmath34 .",
    "the ambiguity in the sign of @xmath31 implies that when , e.g. , @xmath35 , two values of @xmath9 are possible , @xmath36 .",
    "a very important parameter in the phenomenology of 3-neutrino mixing and oscillations is the angle @xmath10 , limited by the data from the chooz and palo verde experiments .",
    "the precise limit on @xmath10 is @xmath37 dependent ( see , e.g , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using the 99.73% allowed range of @xmath38 from ref .",
    "@xcite , one gets from a combined 3-neutrino oscillation analysis of the solar neutrino , chooz and kamland data  @xcite : @xmath39 the global analysis of the solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrino data performed in ref .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath40 at 99.73% c.l .",
    "getting more precise information about the value of the mixing angle @xmath10 , determining the sign of @xmath30 , or the type of the neutrino mass spectrum ( with normal or inverted hierarchy ) , and measuring the value of @xmath9 with a higher precision is of fundamental importance for the progress in the studies of neutrino mixing .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have derived predictions for the nadir angle ( @xmath41 ) dependence of the ratio @xmath0 of the rates of the @xmath1like and @xmath2like multi - gev events measured in water - erenkov detectors in the case of 3-neutrino oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , driven by one neutrino mass squared difference , @xmath42 . this ratio was shown to be particularly sensitive to the earth matter effects in the sub - dominant @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 )  @xcite , and thus i ) to the value of @xmath8 which drives the subdominant oscillations , ii ) to the value of @xmath9 which determines the maximal possible value of the corresponding subdominant transition probabilities , and iii ) to the type of neutrino mass spectrum , i.e. , the sign of @xmath30 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular , that for @xmath47 , @xmath48 and at @xmath49 , the earth matter effects modify substantially the @xmath50 dependence of the ratio @xmath0 and in a way which can not be reproduced with @xmath51 and a different value of @xmath9 . for normal hierarchy",
    ", the effects of interest can be as large as @xmath52 for @xmath53 , can reach @xmath54 in the earth core bin @xmath55 , and might be observable  @xcite .",
    "they were shown to be typically by @xmath56 smaller in the inverted hierarchy case .",
    "this permitted to conclude that an observation of the earth matter effects in the nadir angle distribution of the ratio @xmath0 would clearly indicate that @xmath47 and @xmath57 .    in the present article",
    "we give predictions for the up - down ( u - d ) asymmetry ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the nadir angle dependence of the ratio @xmath0 of the rates of the @xmath1like and @xmath2like multi - gev events measured in water - erenkov detectors ( super - kamiokande , etc . ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the case of 3-neutrino oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , driven by one neutrino mass squared difference , @xmath42 .",
    "the indicated u - d asymmetry is expected to have substantially smaller systematic uncertainty than ( the nadir angle dependence of ) the ratio @xmath0 itself .",
    "the subdominant @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) oscillations of the multi - gev atmospheric neutrinos of interest should exist and their effects could be observable if three - flavor - neutrino mixing takes place in vacuum , i.e. , if @xmath63 , and if @xmath64 is sufficiently large  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "these transitions are driven by @xmath30 .",
    "the probabilities of these transitions contain @xmath9 as factor which determines their maximal value . for @xmath14 , the @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) transitions of the multi - gev atmospheric neutrinos ( antineutrinos )",
    "are amplified ( suppressed ) by the earth matter effects ; if @xmath15 , the transitions of @xmath45 , @xmath65 are suppressed and those of @xmath46 , @xmath66 are enhanced .",
    "therefore for a given sign of @xmath30 , the earth matter affects differently the transitions of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "thus , the study of the subdominant atmospheric neutrino oscillations can provide information , in particular , about the sign of @xmath30 and the magnitudes of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    under the condition @xmath67 , the relevant three - neutrino @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) transition probabilities reduce effectively to a 2-neutrino transition probability  @xcite with @xmath30 and @xmath10 playing the role of the relevant two - neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "the fluxes of atmospheric @xmath68 of energy @xmath22 , which reach the detector after crossing the earth along a given trajectory specified by the value of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , are given by the following expressions in the case of the three - neutrino oscillations under discussion  @xcite : @xmath71~p_{2\\nu}\\right ) , \\label{phie}\\ ] ] @xmath72~p_{2\\nu } \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath73 \\right ) .",

    "the effects of interest are much larger for the multi - gev neutrinos than for the sub - gev neutrinos .",
    "they are also predicted to be larger for the flux of ( and event rate due to ) multi - gev @xmath3 than for the flux of ( and event rate due to ) multi - gev @xmath5 .",
    "the same conclusions are valid for the effects of oscillations on the fluxes of , and event rates due to , atmospheric antineutrinos @xmath4 and @xmath46",
    ".    equations  ( [ phie ] ) -  ( [ phimu ] ) and the similar equations for antineutrinos imply that in the case under study the effects of the @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , oscillations i ) increase with the increase of @xmath90 and are maximal for the largest allowed value of @xmath90 , ii ) should be substantially larger in the multi - gev samples of events than in the sub - gev samples , and iii ) in the case of the multi - gev samples , for @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) they lead to an increase of the rate of @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) events and to a decrease of the @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) event rate .",
    "the last point follows from the fact that the magnitude of the effects we are interested in depends also on the 2-neutrino oscillation probabilities , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and that @xmath95 or @xmath96 ( but not both probabilities ) can be strongly enhanced by the earth matter effects .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "i ) for @xmath98 gev , and ii ) only for sufficiently long neutrino paths in the mantle , i.e. , for @xmath49 .",
    "the magnitude of the matter effects increases with increasing of @xmath8 .",
    "the energy @xmath99 and the path length of neutrinos in the mantle , @xmath21 , for which one can have @xmath100 , are determined by the conditions : @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 and @xmath104 being the mean electron number density along the neutrino trajectory in the mantle and the avogadro number .    in the case of atmospheric neutrinos crossing the earth core ,",
    "new resonance - like effects become apparent . for @xmath105 and @xmath14",
    ", we can have @xmath100 _ only due to the effect of maximal constructive interference between the amplitudes of the @xmath78 transitions in the earth mantle and in the earth core _  @xcite .",
    "the effect differs from the msw one and the enhancement happens in the case of interest at a value of the energy between the resonance energies corresponding to the density in the mantle and that of the core  @xcite .",
