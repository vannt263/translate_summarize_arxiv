    "high harmonic generation ( hhg ) from relativistically intense laser pulses interacting with solid targets has been identified as a promising way to generate bright ultra short bursts of x - rays @xcite .",
    "for the first time this spectacular phenomenon was observed with nanosecond pulses of long wavelength ( @xmath7 m ) co@xmath8 laser light @xcite .",
    "short after the experimental observation in 1981 , bezzerides  _ et  al _  studied the problem of harmonic light emission theoretically @xcite . their approach based on non - relativistic equations of motion and hydrodynamic approximation for",
    "the plasma predicted a cutoff of the harmonic spectrum at the plasma frequency .",
    "10 years later , in 1993 , a new approach to the interaction of an ultra short , relativistically strong laser pulse with overdense plasma was proposed by bulanov _",
    "et  al _",
    "they `` interpreted the harmonic generation as due to the doppler effect produced by a reflecting charge sheet , formed in a narrow region at the plasma boundary , oscillating under the action of the laser pulse ''  @xcite .",
    "the `` oscillating mirror '' model predicts a cutoff harmonic number of @xmath9 , where @xmath2 is the maximal @xmath3-factor of the mirror .    at the beginning of 1996 numerical results of particle - in - cell simulations of the harmonic generation by femtosecond laser - solid interaction",
    "were presented by p.  gibbon @xcite .",
    "he demonstrated numerically that the high harmonic spectrum goes well beyond the cutoff predicted in @xcite and also presented a numerical fit for the spectrum , which approximated the intensity of the @xmath10-th harmonic as @xmath11 . at about the same time",
    "the laser - overdense plasma interaction was also studied by lichters _",
    "_  @xcite .    the same year the analytical work by von der linde and rzazewski @xcite appeared .",
    "the authors used the `` oscillating mirror '' model and approximated the oscillatory motion of the mirror as a @xmath12-function of time without analysis of the applicability of this approximation . with the explicit form of the mirror motion an analytical formula for the harmonic spectrum",
    "was obtained .    the first try to describe analytically the high harmonics generated at the boundary of overdense plasma by a short ultra intense laser pulse in a universal way that does not rely on an explicit formula for the exact plasma mirror motion",
    "was made in @xcite .",
    "this work proposed for the first time the idea of universality of the harmonic spectrum . in an attempt to advocate the `` oscillating mirror '' model and the role of the relativistic doppler effect the authors of @xcite made use of the steepest descent method and estimated the harmonic spectrum as @xmath13 .",
    "however they did not discuss the area of applicability of the steepest descent method for the specific problem .",
    "we are showing in this article that applying the straightforward steepest descent method is equivalent to applying the `` oscillating mirror '' model that proves to be insufficient for the treatment of laser - overdense plasma interaction . in the present work",
    "we revise @xcite and clarify the physical picture of hhg .    for the last couple of years",
    "the interest in the process of high harmonic generation from plasmas has enjoyed a revival thanks to the increasing interest in attoscience .",
    "the recent impressive progress in the physics of attosecond x - ray pulses @xcite triggers the fascinating question whether a range of even shorter ones is achievable with the contemporary or just coming experimental technology .",
    "l.  plaja _ et  al _  @xcite were the first to realize that the simple concept of the `` oscillating mirror '' gives an opportunity to produce extremely short pulses and presented a numerical proof that the radiation generated by oscillating plasma surfaces comes in the form of subfemtosecond pulses .",
    "for the first time the idea to use the plasma harmonics for the generation of subattosecond pulses ( zeptosecond range ) was announced in @xcite .",
    "the present article improves the analytical results of @xcite and studies in detail the ultra relativistic plasma surface motion .",
    "we show that the high harmonics are generated due to sharp spikes in the relativistic @xmath14factor of the plasma surface .",
    "this new physical phenomenon leads to the spectrum cutoff at the harmonic number @xmath15    @xmath16    the cutoff ( [ ap : cutoff ] ) is much higher than the @xmath17-cutoff predicted by the simple `` oscillating mirror '' model . here",
    "@xmath2 is the maximum @xmath14factor of the surface and @xmath4 is a numerical factor of the order of unity , related to the plasma surface acceleration .",
    "our analysis significantly exploits the relativistic plasma similarity theory @xcite , which was developed after the work @xcite had been published .",
    "the similarity theory enables us to rectify our previous results and to present them in a straightforward and clear way .    in this article",
    "we first discuss the physical picture of high harmonic generation .",
    "the production of high harmonics is attributed to the new physical effect of the relativistic spikes .",
    "then , we develop analytical theory describing the spectrum of the high harmonics and show that this spectrum is universal with slow power law decay . finally , the theory is confirmed by direct particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation results .",
    "in this section we state the problem of high harmonic generation at the boundary of overdense plasma and qualitatively describe its main features , which will find their analytical and numerical confirmation in what follows .",
    "let us consider a short laser pulse of ultra relativistic intensity , interacting with the sharp surface of an overdense plasma slab ( see fig .",
    "[ geometryproblem ] ) .",
    "is perpendicular to the surface , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are parallel to it.,width=302 ]     is a smooth function of time , unlike the @xmath3-factor of the surface c),width=151 ]    we assume that the incident laser pulse is short , so that we can neglect the slow ion dynamics and consider the electron motion only .",
    "the electrons are driven by the laser light pressure , a restoring electrostatic force comes from the ions . as a consequence , the plasma surface oscillates and the electrons gain a normal momentum component .",
    "since the plasma is overdense , the incident electromagnetic wave is not able to penetrate it .",
    "this means that there is an electric current along the plasma surface .",
    "for this reason , the momenta of electrons in the skin layer have , apart from the components normal to the plasma surface , also tangential components .    according to the relativistic similarity theory @xcite , both the normal and tangential components are of the order of the dimensionless electromagnetic potential @xmath20 . consequently , the actual electron momenta make a finite angle with the plasma surface for most of the times .    since we consider a laser pulse of ultra relativistic intensity , the motion of the electrons is ultra relativistic .",
    "in other words , their velocities are approximately @xmath21 . though the motion of the plasma surface is qualitatively different : its velocity @xmath22 is not ultra relativistic for most of the times but smoothly approaches @xmath21 only when the tangential electron momentum vanishes ( see fig .",
    "[ velsurf]b ) .",
    "the @xmath3-factor of the surface @xmath23 also shows specific behavior .",
    "it has sharp peaks at those times for which the velocity of the surface approaches @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ velsurf]c ) .",
    "thus , while the velocity function @xmath22 is characterized by its smoothness , the distinctive features of @xmath23 are its quasi - singularities .",
    "when @xmath22 reaches its maximum and @xmath23 has a sharp peak , high harmonics of the incident wave are generated and can be seen in the reflected radiation .",
    "physically this means that the high harmonics are due to the collective motion of bunches of fast electrons moving towards the laser pulse @xcite .",
    "these harmonics have two very important properties .",
    "first , their spectrum is universal .",
    "the exact motion of the plasma surface can be very complicated , since it is affected by the shape of the laser pulse and can differ for different plasmas .",
    "yet the qualitative behavior of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is universal , and since it governs the hhg , the spectrum of the high harmonics does not depend on the particular surface motion .",
    "[ h ]        we show below that the high harmonic spectrum contains two qualitatively different parts : power law decay and exponential decay ( see fig .  [ spectrumplasma ] ) . in the power law part",
    "the spectrum decays as    @xmath24    up to a critical harmonics number that scales as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the intensity of the @xmath10th harmonic ( see section [ sectionuniversalspectrum ] ) . here",
    "@xmath2 is the maximal @xmath3-factor of the point , where the component of the electric field tangential to the surface vanishes ( see section [ boundcond ] ) .",
    "the second important feature of the high harmonics is that they are phase locked .",
    "this observation is of particular value , since it allows for the generation of attosecond and even subattosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "the analytical theory presented in this work is based on the similarity theory developed in @xcite for collisionless ultra relativistic laser - plasma regime and is valid both for under- and overdense plasmas .",
    "the ultra relativistic similarity theory states that when the dimensionless laser vector potential @xmath27 is large ( @xmath28 ) the plasma electron dynamics does not depend on @xmath20 and the plasma electron density @xmath29 separately .",
    "instead they merge in the single dimensionless similarity parameter @xmath30 defined by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the critical electron density for the incident laser pulse with amplitude @xmath20 and carrier frequency @xmath33 .    in other words ,",
    "when the plasma density @xmath29 and the laser amplitude @xmath20 change simultaneously , so that @xmath34 , the laser - plasma dynamics remains similar .",
    "in particular , this basic ultra relativistic similarity means that for different interactions with the same @xmath35 , the plasma electrons move along similar trajectories while their momenta @xmath36 scale as    @xmath37    the @xmath38similarity corresponds to a multiplicative transformation group of the vlasov - maxwell equations , which appears in the ultra relativistic regime .",
    "the similarity is valid for arbitrary values of @xmath30 .",
    "physically the @xmath30-parameter separates relativistically overdense plasmas ( @xmath39 ) from underdense ones ( @xmath40 ) .    to apply the key result ( [ sscalingg ] ) of the similarity theory to the plasma surface motion , we rewrite ( [ sscalingg ] ) for the electron momentum components that are perpendicular @xmath41 and tangential @xmath42 to the plasma surface :    @xmath43    this result is significant .",
    "it shows that when we increase the dimensionless vector potential @xmath20 of the incident wave while keeping the plasma overdense , so that @xmath35 , both @xmath41 and @xmath42 grow as @xmath20 . in other words",
    "the velocities of the skin layer electrons    @xmath44    are about the speed of light almost at all times .",
    "yet the relativistic @xmath3-factor of the plasma surface @xmath45 and its velocity @xmath46 behave in a quite different way .",
    "to realize this key fact let us consider the electrons at the very boundary of the plasma .",
    "the scalings ( [ sscalingnt ] ) state that the momenta of these electrons can be represented as    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are universal functions , which depend on the pulse shape and the @xmath30-parameter rather than on @xmath20 or @xmath29 separately . consequently , for @xmath46 and @xmath45 one obtains    @xmath50    one sees from ( [ electronvelocity ] ) that when @xmath20 gets large , the relativistic @xmath3-factor of the electrons becomes large too and their velocities approach the velocity of light .",
    "however , the dynamics of the plasma boundary is significantly different . for large @xmath20s the plasma boundary motion does not enter the ultra relativistic regime and",
    "its relativistic @xmath3-factor @xmath45 is generally of the order of unity .",
    "yet there is one exception : if at the moment @xmath51 it happens that @xmath52 , i.e.    @xmath53    we have    @xmath54    so the relativistic @xmath3-factor of the boundary jumps to @xmath55 and the duration of the relativistic @xmath3-factor spike can be estimated as    @xmath56    for the velocity of the plasma boundary one finds analogously that it smoothly approaches the velocity of light as @xmath57 .",
    "[ velsurf ] represents schematically this behavior .    as we will see later",
    ", the @xmath23 spikes cause the generation of high harmonics in the form of ultra short laser pulses .",
    "in this section we introduce the boundary condition describing the laser - overdense plasma interaction appealing to physical arguments , just as it was previously done in @xcite .",
    "mathematically rigorous analysis of the boundary condition is given in @xcite .",
    "however , for the purposes of the present work it is sufficient to treat this problem on a more intuitive basis @xcite .",
    "one might expect that the `` oscillating mirror '' model could describe the laser - plasma interaction in our problem .",
    "therefore we want to explain in detail why it is not the case and then present the derivation of the correct boundary condition .",
    "the `` oscillating mirror '' model implies that the tangential components of the vector potential are zero at the mirror surface . as a consequence , if the ideal mirror moves with @xmath58 towards the laser pulse with the electric field @xmath59 and the duration @xmath60 , the reflected electric field will be @xmath61 and the pulse duration will be @xmath62",
    ". the energy of the reflected pulse would be then @xmath63 times higher than that of the incident one . however , since the plasma surface is driven by the same laser pulse , this scaling is energetically prohibited and consequently the plasma can not be described as an `` ideal mirror '' .    to derive the correct boundary condition ,",
    "let us consider the tangential vector potential components of a laser pulse normally incident onto a overdense plasma slab .",
    "these components satisfy the equation    @xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the tangential plasma current density .",
    "( [ maxwell ] ) yields    @xmath67    here @xmath68 , where we have defined @xmath69 and @xmath70 , using the heaviside step - function @xmath71 . due to this choice of @xmath72",
    "the vector potential @xmath73 satisfies both eq .",
    "( [ maxwell ] ) and the boundary condition at @xmath74 since @xmath75 .",
    "the tangential electric field is @xmath76 .",
    "if we denote the position of the electron fluid surface by @xmath77 we have    @xmath78    where @xmath79 .",
    "now one has to estimate the parameters characterizing the skin layer , i.e. the characteristic time @xmath80 of skin layer evolution ( in the co - moving reference frame ) and the skin layer thickness @xmath81 .",
    "since the plasma is driven by the light pressure , one expects that @xmath82 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath81 is more subtle . from the ultra relativistic similarity theory",
    "follows that @xmath83 , where @xmath84 for strongly overdense plasmas and @xmath85 is an exponent that has to be found analytically . in this work",
    "we do not discuss the exact value of @xmath85 , but notice that this quantity does not depend on neither @xmath30 , nor @xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand , the denser the plasma , the less the value of @xmath81 .",
    "this condition demands that @xmath86 and we get @xmath87 for @xmath84 .    if the characteristic time @xmath80 of the skin layer evolution is long ( @xmath88 ) , then we can use the taylor expansion @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , and substitute this expression into ( [ integrated ] ) .",
    "the zero order terms cancel each other and we get @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the maximum plasma surface current . thus ,",
    "as long as the skin - layer is thin and the plasma surface current is limited , we can use the leontovich boundary condition @xcite    @xmath93    this condition has a straightforward relation to energy conservation . indeed ,",
    "if we consider the poynting vector    @xmath94    we notice that the boundary condition ( [ boundarycondition ] ) represents balance between the incoming and reflected electromagnetic energy flux at the boundary @xmath77 .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ boundarycondition ] ) allows for another interpretation .",
    "an external observer sees that the electromagnetic radiation gets reflected at the point @xmath95 , where the normal component of the poynting vector @xmath96 , implied by @xmath97 .",
    "we call the point @xmath95 _ the apparent reflection point _ ( arp ) .    the actual location of the arp can be easily found from the electromagnetic field distribution in front of the plasma surface . the incident laser field in vacuum runs in the negative @xmath98direction , @xmath99 , while the reflected field is translated backwards : @xmath100",

    "the fine structure of the spectrum of @xmath114 depends on the particular surface motion @xmath77 , which is defined by the complex laser- plasma interaction at the plasma surface .",
    "previous theoretical works on high order harmonic generation from plasma surfaces @xcite tried to approximate the function @xmath77 in order to evaluate the harmonic spectrum . for the first time analytical description of the high harmonic intensity spectrum and the concept of universality were presented in @xcite .",
    "this work proclaims the idea that the most important features of the high harmonic spectrum do not depend on the detailed structure of @xmath77 .",
    "however , the article @xcite treats the universal spectrum without any relation to similarity theory for ultra relativistic plasmas and , as a result , relies on the saddle - point method without proper analysis whether or not the areas contributing to the spectrum overlap @xcite . in our analysis we overcome these shortcomings of @xcite .    to find the spectrum , we notice that the investigation of @xmath115 ( [ spectrum ] ) is equivalent to the investigation of the function    @xmath116    where    @xmath117    here @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 is a slowly varying function @xmath123 , which is trivially related to @xmath124 as    @xmath125    making use of eq .",

    "the high energy cutoff ( [ ap : cutoff ] ) of the power law spectrum defines the shortest pulse duration that can be achieved this way .",

    "it follows from the expression ( [ lowfrequency ] ) that the electric field of the filtered pulse decreases very slowly with the filter threshold as @xmath216 .",
    "the pulse duration decreases as @xmath217 . at the same time , the fundamental frequency of the pulse is @xmath210 .",
    "therefore the pulse is hollow when @xmath218 , i.e. its envelope is not filled with electric field oscillations .",
    "one possible application of these pulses is to study atom excitation by means of a single strong kick .",

    "however , the pulse duration @xmath221 does not depend on @xmath210 .",
    "since the fundamental frequency of the pulse grows as @xmath210 , the pulses obtained with an above - cutoff filter are filled with electric field oscillations .",
    "therefore these pulses are suitable to study the resonance excitation of ion and atom levels .",
    "the minimal duration of the pulse obtained by cutting - off low order harmonics is defined by the spectrum cutoff @xmath222 .",
    "physically , this result is the consequence of the ultra relativistic spikes in the plasma surface @xmath14factor .",
    "in this section we discuss the harmonic phases and show how the interference of harmonics produced by different @xmath14spikes can lead to spectrum modulations .",
    "( [ contributions ] ) obtained in section [ sectionuniversalspectrum ] allows for straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "the sum @xmath223 gives the contribution of the @xmath133-spike of the surface relativistic factor to the harmonic spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ velocity ] ) .",
    "therefore the phase of the @xmath10th harmonic @xmath224 due to the @xmath133s spike is given by    @xmath225    where @xmath226 is the phase of the incident laser pulse at the time @xmath133 and @xmath227 , the time of the observation , i.e. the symbol @xmath228 is redundant , yet we keep it for the sake of notation coherency .",
    "since @xmath229 for @xmath230 , eq .",
    "( [ phase1 ] ) gives rise to @xmath231 .",
    "this means that each spike radiates phase locked high harmonics that can be used for ultra short pulse production .",
    "another consequence of @xmath232 is that the amplitude of the harmonics is proportional to @xmath233 .",
    "the mechanism presented in fig .",
    "[ velsurf ] has another very interesting consequence .",
    "each harmonic is generated due to several spikes .",
    "these spikes contribute to ( [ contributions ] ) with different phase multipliers .",
    "this phase difference leads to modulations in the high harmonic spectrum . as an example we consider the interference between the harmonics produced by two different spikes in detail .",
    "the phase shift between the contributions from different spikes is @xmath234 and can be large for large @xmath10 . since for @xmath235 only @xmath236 enters @xmath237 , the values of the contributions from the @xmath238 spikes for this harmonic range do not depend on @xmath239 . as a result the modulations in this harmonic range depend only on the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "to recapitulate , the non - trivial plasma motion producing more than one @xmath3-spike per oscillation period is the cause of the spectrum modulation .",
