    "the fact that spin relaxation and dephasing rates are rather long compared to charge excitations life - times has recently stimulated the investigation of spin transport in purely magnetic systems without an accompanying charge transport .",
    "experimentally , anomalous heat transport has been reported in @xmath1-materials @xcite , which is explained by the specific dynamics of spin excitations in quasi - onedimensional systems @xcite .",
    "these experiments are still in the incoherent regime where the mean free path of the spinons is much smaller than the system size .",

    "matveev@xcite studied spinon transport through a one - dimensional wigner crystal , which effectively can be described by an antiferromagnetically ordered spin chain . here ,",
    "anomalous conductance quantization phenomena occur which might explain experiments through quantum point contacts @xcite . + motivated by these interesting recent results for spin transport through one - dimensional spin chains , we analyze in this work the magnetic analog of electronic transport through zero - dimensional quantum dots in the weak coupling regime ( i.e.  weak exchange coupling between the magnetic quantum dot and the magnetization reservoirs ) .",
    "in particular , we study the spin current through a quantum dot consisting of two interacting spin-@xmath0 , coupled to two ferromagnetic insulators , which are for simplicity described by a ferromagnetic heisenberg model ( the basic transport features revealed here are expected to hold for any reservoir involving magnon - like excitations ) . for the same system",
    "wang et al.@xcite derived a landauer - bttiker - type formula for spin current transport .",

    "it was shown that the latter may be modulated , e.g. by application of gates . in contrast to electronic transport , we find that the specific microscopic coupling configuration and the magnon dispersion relation in the reservoirs has a strong influence on the spin current .",
    "interestingly , the spin current can not only be dominated by 1-magnon transport processes , but also by 2-magnon cycles , leading to specific resonances or antiresonances in the spin current as function of the intra - dot exchange coupling .",

    "+ in this antiparallel configuration a spin current flows even without an additional driving mechanism , such as a magnetic field gradient applied , since the reservoir magnetizations tend to equalize by exciting magnons in both of the reservoirs . fig .",
    "[ fig : ir_anti ] shows exemplarily the spin current as a function of  @xmath7 for the case of serial coupling . in view of the basic transport principles the main change is , that transitions over the right reservoir can now only occur between states where the state with higher energy has the lower spin quantum number in @xmath119direction , since the magnons in the right reservoir carry a ` spin - down ' .",
    "+ the spin current @xmath121 is negative since ` spin - ups ' are entering the left reservoir , in order to equalize the magnetizations .",
    "the current is suppressed , when the singlet level lies between the two outer triplet levels , since then the right reservoir is completely decoupled . in the remaining sectors a non - vanishing spin current is carried by magnon tunneling processes which involve all dot levels , as indicated in the level schemes in fig .",
    "[ fig : ir_anti ] .",
    "since these processes require a magnon to be initially excited in the left reservoir ( long upward arrow in the level schemes ) , the current decays exponentially with increasing @xmath172 .",
    "furthermore , due to this the current vanishes with vanishing temperature .",
    "+ we conclude that also in this antiparallel configuration the spin current can be switched by tuning the intra - dot parameters @xmath9 and @xmath7 , e.g.  by simply evoking a @xmath115-crossing .",
    "in summary , our investigation of the proposed spin quantum dot system revealed a rich structure of the spin current as a function of the intra - dot parameters @xmath9 and @xmath7 . due to the involved large current variations , a switching of the current is possible in principle .",
    "+ for the case of _ parallel magnetized reservoirs _ the influence of the dot - reservoir couplings on the spin transport becomes apparent by opposing the serial and parallel coupling configurations .",
    "the restriction of the transitions in the case of parallel coupling leads to drastically different transport characteristics , which originate from the sequential 2-magnon tunneling .",
    "however , due to the differing signs of the dot - reservoir couplings , the parallel coupling configuration represents rather an extreme case compared to the serial coupling configuration which suggests itself . it shall be mentioned that small deviations from the ` pure ' coupling configurations discussed here , do not lead to qualitative modifications of the spin current results .",
    "+ the concept of a magnetochemical potential as sum of the chemical potential and the magnetic field , analog to the electrochemical potential in the electronic case , is deficient .",
    "the magnon chemical potential controls the magnon occupation , whereas an applied magnetic field gradient shifts the magnon band edges while leaving the overall magnon occupation unchanged .",
    "as we have shown , both mechanisms , the differing left and right magnon chemical potentials as also the magnetic field gradient , yield different results for the spin current .",
    "this is due to the fact that the magnon dispersion relation , particularly the band edges , play an essential role in spin transport , in contrast to the case of electronic transport , which primarily takes place between the electrochemical potentials .",
    "in the case of _ antiparallel magnetized reservoirs _ the main features of the spin current can be explained by considering slightly modified spin transport principles .",
    "as we have shown , here spin current switching is possible too .",
    "we remark , that in those sectors where the spin current carried by single magnon tunneling is exponentially suppressed , a cotunneling of magnons , analog to its electronic pendant , may yield non - negligible contributions to the spin current .",
    "however , the current suppression due to magnon dispersion effects should remain untouched .",
