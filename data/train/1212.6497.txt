    "hard - particle systems in general offer a great opportunity to understand the mechanism of a variety of physical phenomena , including crystal nucleation  @xcite , glass transition  @xcite and jamming  @xcite .",
    "the spherical particles , such as hard spheres and hard disks , have been studied intensively during the past decades . in particular , for a system of hard spheres , an entropy - driven liquid - crystal transition occurs at sufficiently high density  @xcite and a hard - sphere glass can also be formed above the glass transition point if crystallization is avoided  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , non - spherical particles play a fundamental role in the physics of molecular liquids and attract growing interest in recent years because of their usefulness in forming functional structures . from the theoretical point of view , it is interesting to include the rotational degrees of freedom for the particles and investigate the physical behavior of a system composed of anisotropic particles .",
    "such study uncovers new types of behavior and holds potential for providing new insights that can not be obtained from studies of spherical objects  @xcite . from the practical point of view",
    ", the constituent particles often have non - spherical shapes in real materials such as laponite  @xcite , and the building blocks with anisotropic shape can provide a powerful candidate for the assembly of particular targeted structures  @xcite . thus , exploration of systems composed of anisotropic particles is also valuable for materials design . in this paper , we present an event - driven molecular dynamics ( edmd ) study of hard ellipses .",
    "a system of hard ellipses can be regraded as one of the simplest models of two - dimensional ( 2d ) anisotropic particles and its phase behavior is very rich .",
    "yet , the thermodynamic , structural and dynamical properties of hard ellipses remain largely unknown .",
    "the phase transitions , in particular , the isotropic - nematic (",
    "i - n ) transition , of hard ellipses have been studied by computer simulations and various theoretical approaches . in vieillard - baron s pioneering monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in @xmath7 ensemble ( i.e. , the particle number @xmath8 , the volume @xmath9 and the termperature @xmath10 are constant )  @xcite , three different phases , including isotropic liquid , nematic liquid crystal and solid , have been identified in a hard - ellipse system with an aspect ratio of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote semi - major and semi - minor axes .",
    "vieillard - baron observed that both i - n and nematic - solid ( n - s ) transitions are of first order , as evidenced by a small discontinuity shown in the equation of state ( eos , i.e. , density - dependence of the reduced pressure @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , computer simulations show that the i - n transition in a 2d fluid of hard needles  @xcite and long hard rods  @xcite , which in principle share the similar physics with elongated hard ellipses , is continuous rather than first - order . moreover , the @xmath14 ( i.e. , the particle number @xmath8 , the pressure @xmath15 and the termperature @xmath10 are constant ) mc simulations of cuesta and frenkel  @xcite indicate that while there is no stable nematic phase in hard ellipses for @xmath16 , the i - n transition is of first order for @xmath17 and continuous via disclination unbinding for @xmath18 .",
    "hence , it appears that the nature of the i - n transition depends on the aspect ratio and that the phase diagram possesses a tricritical point at which the transition changes from first - order to continuous .",
    "thus , on the simulation side , a definite conclusion has not been reached on the phase transitions of hard ellipses .",
    "this issue is also contentious on the theoretical side .",
    "ward and lado  @xcite found based on the percus - yevick ( py ) integral equation theory that the i - n transition does not take place in a fluid of hard ellipses although orientational ordering is allowed . while , the density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite and the effective - liquid approach  @xcite indicate that the i - n transition is continuous for hard ellipses with arbitrary aspect ratios .",
    "the other forms of dft  @xcite , the onsager theory - based approach  @xcite , and the scaled particle theory ( spt )  @xcite predict the existence of the i - n transition in hard ellipses , but its location differs from these theoretical predictions . therefore , a clear understanding of the phase transitions in hard ellipses is still lacking . here , it should also be mentioned that the phase behavior of binary hard ellipses was recently investigated by a scaled particle dft  @xcite and a weighted dft  @xcite .",
    "another important issue concerns the orientational order in the 2d nematic liquid crystals .",
    "straley has shown  @xcite that true long - range order ( lro ) can not exist in a 2d nematic phase if the particles interact via a separable potential , but the existence of true lro can not be excluded if the potential is not separable into positional and orientational parts .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated by computer simulations  @xcite that a general property of a 2d nematic phase is the lack of true lro , although earlier simulations  @xcite also show that the system with the nonseparable potential exhibits true lro .",
    "for this reason , the systems that lack true lro are usually referred to as having quasi - lro . in the elastic continuum theory  @xcite ,",
    "quasi - lro is expected to appear in a 2d nematic phase if the free energy associated with collective fluctuations in the particle orientations can be expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 characterizes the orientation at position @xmath21 with respect to a fixed axis and @xmath22 is the 2d frank s elastic constant  @xcite .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( 1 ) , one can derive that the amplitude of the orientational fluctuations diverges with the system size in a logarithmic manner , @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the ensemble average , @xmath25 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath10 is the absolute temperature and @xmath8 is the particle number . as a consequence , both the 2d nematic order parameter @xmath26 and the angular correlation function @xmath27 decay algebraically , i.e. , @xmath28 @xmath29)>\\sim r^{-2l^{2}k_{b}t/\\pi k},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a positive integer .",
    "equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) imply that a 2d nematic phase with quasi - lro can be characterized by a vanishing orientational order parameter in the thermodynamic limit and a power - law decay of the angular correlation function .",
    "if the transition from a 2d nematic phase with quasi - lro to an isotropic phase proceeds via the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) disclination unbinding mechanism  @xcite , it should occur at a universal value of the renormalized frank s constant , @xmath31  @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a different mechanism is also possible , but there is no stable nematic phase at values of the frank s constant below @xmath32 .",
    "thus , one can quantitatively identify the location where the stable nematic phase starts to form by monitoring the system size dependence of the nematic order parameter or from the spatial correlation of the particle orientations .",
    "we note that the algebraic decay of the angular correlation function has been evidenced by simulations of 2d hard needles  @xcite , 2d hard rods  @xcite , hard ellipses  @xcite , and recently by experiments of quasi-2d suspensions of hard ellipsoids  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the efforts made on understanding the phase behavior and the structure of hard ellipses , little attention has been paid on their dynamics despite its fundamental and technological importance .",
    "the dynamical properties of hard needles have been studied by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations about three decades ago  @xcite .",
    "the diffusive process of a single hard ellipsoid confined in two dimensions was measured just several years ago in experiments  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the diffusion of quasi-2d suspensions of hard ellipsoids with @xmath33 has been explored very recently by video - microscopy experiments  @xcite and the enhancement of the translational diffusion with respect to the rotational diffusion has been rationalized in terms of the formation of unstable nematic - like regions with an average lifetime that exceeds the characteristic time of diffusion in a recent mc study  @xcite . in spite of the aforementioned progress",
    ", our knowledge of the dynamics of hard ellipses is far from complete . to our knowledge , there are no available md results concerning the self - diffusion of hard ellipses so far .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze in detail the thermodynamic , structural and self - diffusive properties in the various phases of hard ellipses , with the aim of examining the effects of aspect ratio and area fraction and exploring connections between different properties . to this end , we perform edmd simulations for hard ellipses over a wide range of aspect ratios and area fractions , covering state points including the isotropic , plastic and nematic phases .",
    "we present the eos for a series of @xmath4 values and compare the simulation results with a recent prediction of the spt in the isotropic phase .",
    "we find that spt well describes the isotropic branch of the eos in hard ellipses .",
    "dependence of @xmath4 on the reduced pressure @xmath3 is explored in the various phases . at large fixed area fractions",
    ", @xmath3 increases with @xmath4 in both the isotropic and the plastic phases , and interestingly , its dependence on @xmath4 is rather weak in the nematic phase .",
    "we rationalize the thermodynamics of hard ellipses in terms of particle motions , which show different features in different phases .",
    "the static structures , both positionally and orientationally , are then investigated in the various phases .",
    "our simulations show that the plastic crystal forms for aspect ratios up to @xmath5 , while appearance of the stable nematic phase starts approximately at @xmath6 for the studied density range .",
    "the locations of the isotropic - plastic ( i - p ) transition and the i - n transition are determined by analyzing the bond - orientation correlation functions and the angular correlation functions , respectively . as expected ,",
    "the i - p transition point is found to increase with @xmath4 , while a larger @xmath4 leads to a smaller area fraction where the i - n transition takes place . in addition , our results strongly support that the 2d nematic phase in hard ellipses has only quasi - lro .",
    "we further explore the self - diffusion of hard ellipses .",
    "we find that a phase transition in the translational degrees of freedom is indeed reflected by an enhancement in the rotational diffusion and vice versa .",
    "hence , a clear connection is revealed between the structure and the self - diffusion .",
    "we discuss the relevance of our results to the glass transition in hard ellipses , which is a subject of recent experimental investigation  @xcite .",
    "we finally provide the results of the isodiffusivity lines for hard ellipses and discuss the effect of spatial dimension on the diffusive dynamics of hard ellipsoidal particles by comparing results of hard ellipses and uniaxial hard ellipsoids  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we specify the details of the simulation and the model system used in this work .",
    "thermodynamic , structural and self - diffusive properties of hard ellipses are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "a summary of our findings is given in sec .",
    "iv . in the appendix",
    ", we add the main ingredients for implementing an edmd simulation for hard ellipses and a brief discussion on the effect of the system size .",
    "we perform extensive edmd simulations of hard ellipses in a square box under periodic boundary conditions in @xmath7 ensemble .",
    "the main ingredients for implementing an edmd simulation for hard ellipses are described in the appendix a. in a simulation , we fix the particle number @xmath8 and the area of the simulation box @xmath34 with @xmath35 the box dimension . in order to explore the properties in different phases ,",
    "we investigate two sets of aspect ratios , i.e. , @xmath36 with an interval of @xmath37 and @xmath38 with an interval of @xmath39 , and a wide range of area fractions ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath41 . at sufficiently high densities , a nematic phase ( i.e.",
    ", particles have their centers of mass at random but exhibit some long - range orientational order ) is expected to form for large @xmath4 values while a plastic phasealso known as the rotator phase , in which particles are oriented at random but their centers of mass have some ordered arrangement ) can form for small @xmath4 values .",
    "all the particles have the same mass @xmath42 and the same moment of inertia @xmath43 . both @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "are set to be unity for convenience in our simulations . in principle , ellipses with the same mass but different aspect ratios should have different moment of inertia . in our simulations ,",
    "the function of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( together with the particle velocities ) is to determine the temperature @xmath10 of the system via equipartition theorem .",
    "as we work on the athermal hard - particle system , the temperature only affects the time scale of the system ( see the time unit below ) .",
    "since we will report all results in reduced units , we expect that the results correctly capture the trends of static and dynamic quantities in variation with area fraction and aspect ratio .",
    "this is indeed strongly supported by the fact that our results for the static properties ( such as the reduced pressure ) are consistent with previously available mc simulations  @xcite , where neither @xmath42 nor @xmath43 is relevant , suggesting that the general trends in this work are essentially unaffected by the choice of @xmath42 and @xmath43 once the results are given in reduced units .",
    "the temperature @xmath10 is irrelevant for athermal systems and remains constant due to the conservation of the total kinetic energy .",
    "we set @xmath44 to be unity in this work .",
    "note that @xmath10 contains both translational and rotational parts in the case of hard ellipses and that the separate temperature in each part fluctuates during the simulation .",
    "length , time and pressure are expressed in units of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the following ,",
    "we report results for @xmath48 .",
    "however , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , it is also useful to study the effect of the system size especially in the nematic phase .",
    "we thus also perform simulations of hard ellipses with @xmath49 and @xmath50 for selected state points , and a brief discussion on the effect of the system size will be shown in the appendix b.    in order to generate the starting configuration of a hard - ellipse system with specific @xmath4 and @xmath2 , we used the lubachevsky - stillinger ( ls ) compression algorithm  @xcite , in which the particles collide elastically and expand uniformly at a certain growth rate .",
    "ls algorithm was initially designed for hard spherical particles and recently it has been generalized to the case of hard ellipsoidal particles  @xcite . in the compression process , we started with a low - density hard - ellipse fluid at @xmath51 and used a quite small growth rate of @xmath52 so that the created initial configuration already remained close to be in an equilibrium or stable state .",
    "these initial states were then used as inputs for edmd simulations . at each aspect ratio ,",
    "@xmath53 time units at @xmath54 and up to @xmath55 time units at @xmath56 were used to equilibrate the system , and then another @xmath57 time units for collecting data .",
    "four independent runs were performed for each state point in order to obtain reliable results and improve the statistics.thus , the results presented in this paper have been averaged among four independent samples .. it is worth mentioning that the slowest run takes over four weeks on a @xmath58 ghz central processing unit ( cpu ) .",
    "we note that in the solid phase ( i.e. , particles show long - range order both positionally and orientationally ) , it will be useful to allow the shape of the simulation box to change during the simulation , because the box shape is necessarily compatible with the equilibrium shape of the unit cell in order to form a solid phase .",
    "this has been done in previous @xmath14 mc simulations  @xcite in order to study the transition from an isotropic or a nematic phase to a solid phase in hard ellipses .",
    "the box shape is fixed to be square in our simulations since our aim here is not to determine the location where the solid phase forms , but to focus on the physical properties of the formed phases in edmd simulations .",
    "meanwhile , we do not investigate the melting process of a perfect hard - ellipse solid ( which is a stretched triangular lattice ) .",
    "for these reasons , we did not observe the solid phase for all the state points studied in this work , please see subsection iii b for further discussion .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss our results of the thermodynamic , structural and self - diffusive properties in hard ellipses .",
    "first of all , the eos is shown for a wide range of aspect ratios and the reduced pressure ( i.e. , compressibility factor ) in the isotropic phase is compared with a recent result of the spt .",
    "we also explore the dependence of the reduced pressure on the aspect ratio in the different phases and discuss the influence of the particle motions on the thermodynamics . in subsection iii b ,",
    "we analyze in detail the positional and orientational order of hard ellipses and compare our results with previous simulations when possible .",
    "finally , we investigate the self - diffusion of hard ellipses and demonstrate connections between the structure and the self - diffusion .",
    "the relevance of our results to the glass transition in hard ellipses is briefly discussed .",
    "we also show the results of the isodiffusivity lines in both the translational and the rotational degrees of freedom and discuss the effect of spatial dimension on the diffusive dynamics of hard ellipsoidal particles .       as a function of area fraction @xmath2 for ( a ) hard disks and hard ellipses with @xmath59 and ( b ) hard ellipses with @xmath38 .",
    "the results are shifted up by @xmath60 from the preceding small @xmath4 for clarity .",
    "the dotted lines are simulation results and the solid lines are the results of the spt [ eq .",
    "the green dashed line in ( a ) is the spt prediction for the equation of state of hard disks in the isotropic state , i.e. , eq .",
    "( 10 ) in ref .",
    "the circles indicate the area fractions where the system starts to form stable plastic crystals in ( a ) and stable nematic crystals in ( b ) , respectively ( see the structural analysis in subsection iii b ) . the semi - log plot in the inset of fig .",

    "the dotted lines are a guide to the eye . for these densities ,",
    "the system has a plastic phase for @xmath62 , a nematic phase for @xmath63 and an isotropic phase in between.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    knowledge of an accurate eos for a model system is of fundamental importance and particularly useful for providing information on what type of an underlying phase transition is .",
    "we present the results of eos for hard ellipses for various aspect ratios in fig .",
    "1 . the eos for a system of hard disks is also included in fig .",
    "1(a ) . here",
    ", the reduced pressure @xmath64 is computed by the momentum exchange from particle collisions in edmd ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we checked that our results for @xmath16 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are consistent with the compression runs in previous mc simulations  @xcite .",
    "let us first focus on hard ellipses with small @xmath4 values .",
    "in this situation , the orientational order is not appreciable in the system but the positional order can develop upon compression , leading to the formation of plastic crystals at sufficiently high densities .",
    "the appearance of the positional order can significantly affect the thermodynamics of the system and it is indeed reflected by a discontinuity in the eos , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . the plastic crystal was already observed for a system of hard ellipses with @xmath67 about four decades ago by vieillard - baron  @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that the plastic crystal can be formed in hard ellipses with aspect ratios up to @xmath5 .",
    "the observation of the discontinuity in the eos is compatible with the scenario of a first - order transition , but it should be viewed with some caution since the nature of the formation of a 2d crystalline phase is unclear even in the case of hard disks ; e.g. , although the kosterlitz , thouless , halperin , nelson and young ( kthny ) theory may not rule out other melting scenarios  @xcite , a famous one is that the melting of hard disks proceeds via two continuous phase transitions with an intermediate phase called hexatic phase  @xcite , while the recent large - scale computer simulations  @xcite reveal that the liquid - hexatic transition is of first order .",
    "we will further discuss this issue in subsection iii b by analyzing the structure of the system .",
    "moreover , we find in fig .",
    "1(a ) that the discontinuity shown in the eos becomes less apparent as @xmath4 gets larger and nearly undetectable within the studied density range for @xmath68 .",
    "this can be easily understood since the particle s anisotropy tends to destroy the positional order of the system , and thus will be in favor of the isotropic phase .",
    "for hard ellipses with sufficiently large elongations , the orientational order is expected to appear and the positional order will be highly suppressed , resulting in the formation of 2d nematic liquid crystals in hard ellipses . as already found in other 2d models  @xcite ,",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the system are indeed not very sensitive to the occurrence of the orientational order .",
    "this is also confirmed by our results of the eos for hard ellipses with @xmath63 , as shown in fig .",
    "for these @xmath4 values , the system does have a nematic phase above some area fraction , but the corresponding change in the eos is rather mild .",
    "thus , we can not unambiguously determine the nature of the i - n transition based on solely the thermodynamics .",
    "however , by a close inspection of the results in the semi - log plot [ see the inset of fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , some difference in the eos can be seen with varying @xmath4 .",
    "it seems that some inflection points exhibit in the eos for large aspect ratios , while the slope @xmath69 monotonically increases with @xmath2 for small aspect ratios , i.e. , the @xmath2-evolution of @xmath3 differs qualitatively from relatively small to very large aspect ratio .",
    "this suggests that the nature of the i - n transition changes with aspect ratio .",
    "in fact , previous mc simulations imply the existence of a tricritical point between @xmath17 and @xmath66 in the phase diagram of hard ellipses  @xcite .",
    "the i - n transition is first - order below the tricritical point and becomes continuous above it .",
    "interestingly , we find that the appearance of the inflection points in the eos starts within the same @xmath4 range .",
    "thus , our results appear to support the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram of hard ellipses .",
    "however , since the location of such a point is very hard to determine even if it exists , we will focus on characterizing the properties of different phases in hard ellipses .",
    "next , we compare the reduced pressure in the isotropic phase of hard ellipses with a recent result of the spt .",
    "as mentioned in section i , the eos of hard ellipses can also be obtained by various theories .",
    "hence , it is meaningful to test these theoretical predictions as our results cover a wide window of @xmath4 and @xmath2 and contain data in the various phases .",
    "spt in general provides a simple form for the eos of a model system and its usefulness has been confirmed by the study of hard disks  @xcite .",
    "other existing theories also provide relevant results , but the solution of the eos needs to be solved numerically  @xcite .",
    "thus , we concentrate here on a very recent result of the spt  @xcite . on the basis of the spt ,",
    "boulk derived an eos for the isotropic fluid of hard ellipses  @xcite , which has the following form @xmath70}{(1-\\phi)^{2}},\\ ] ] where the non - circularity parameter @xmath61 has been introduced .",
    "@xmath61 is calculated according to the formula @xmath71 with @xmath72 the perimeter of the ellipse .",
    "the value of @xmath72 can be expressed accurately by the complete elliptic integral of the second kind , and a rather good approximation can be obtained from the following formula : @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( 6 ) to calculate @xmath61 in this work and the results of the eq .",
    "( 5 ) are shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "1 . as a reference , the area fractions where the system starts to form stable plastic crystals and stable nematic crystals",
    "are also shown in fig .",
    "1 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the simulation results and the spt prediction are almost indistinguishable in the isotropic phase for @xmath75 , indicating a fairly good description of eq .",
    "( 5 ) for the eos of hard ellipses with small @xmath4 values .",
    "meanwhile , the predicted eos deviates from the simulation results above some area fraction for @xmath63 , as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the system is not isotropic but exhibits orientational order at high densities for large @xmath4 values . in fig .",
    "1(b ) , one can find that the area fraction where eq .",
    "( 5 ) starts to deviate from the simulations is much smaller than the i - n transition point [ see circles in the main plot of fig .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the short - range orientational order already appears in the system at smaller area fractions ( see subsection iii b ) .",
    "taking this into account , we find that eq .",
    "( 5 ) well describes the isotropic branch of the eos for hard ellipses even with large @xmath4 values .",
    "we can also use @xmath61 as a variable to test eq .",
    "the results for representative area fractions are shown in fig .",
    "we find that the theoretical and simulation results agree well for low densities . at high densities ,",
    "deviations appear for large @xmath61 values because of the occurrence of short - range or some long - range orientational order , as evidenced by the non - monotonic dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that spt provides a good description of the eos for the isotropic phase of hard ellipses .",
    "it is interesting to further explore dependence of the reduced pressure on the aspect ratio in the various phases of hard ellipses . to this end , we plot @xmath3 as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath41 in fig .",
    "3 . for these densities",
    ", the system has a plastic phase for @xmath62 , a nematic phase for @xmath63 and an isotropic phase in between ( see subsection iii b ) .",
    "we find that @xmath3 monotonically increases with @xmath4 at fixed densities in both the isotropic and the plastic phases ( i.e. , @xmath75 at @xmath78 ) , suggesting that the thermodynamics of the system can be significantly influenced by the particle shape when the ellipses are oriented at random .",
    "note that this conclusion is still valid for even larger @xmath4 values ( see the results for @xmath79 in fig .",
    "2 ) . interestingly enough , in the nematic phase ( i.e. , @xmath63 at @xmath78 ) , when the particles show some long - range orientational order but have their centers of mass at random , @xmath3 depends on @xmath4 very weakly .",
    "although not pointed out before , the same conclusion can be drawn from previous @xmath14 mc simulations  @xcite , which indicate that the area fractions are almost identical at the same pressure in the nematic phase of hard ellipse at least for @xmath17 and @xmath66 . to understand the above findings",
    ", we recall that the reduced pressure is calculated from the momentum exchange during collisions of two ellipses , which indeed contains translational and rotational parts ( although they are coupled with each other ) .",
    "it is expected that the contribution from the rotational motions becomes more apparent as the ellipses get more elongated .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath3 increases with @xmath4 in the plastic and the isotropic phases , where the particles can freely move both translationally and rotationally ( see fig .",
    "14 ) . in the nematic phase",
    ", however , particles on average line up preferentially along a common direction . in this case , the rotational dynamics becomes extremely slow , but the motions of the particles have little hindrance in the translational degrees of freedom ( see fig .",
    "14 ) and thus the translational part becomes dominant in determining the reduced pressure of the system .",
    "we then speculate that the translational part must be very similar for all aspect ratios at the same density in the nematic phase so that @xmath3 has only weak dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamics of hard ellipses could be explained in terms of the particle motions .",
    "we now turn to the structural properties of hard ellipses . as a system of hard ellipses with sufficiently large aspect ratios",
    "has a transition from the isotropic liquid to the 2d liquid crystal , much attention has been paid on the structure of the nematic phase in hard ellipses , i.e. , on characterizing the orientational order of elongated hard ellipses . instead of focusing solely on the orientational correlations , we explore both positional and orientational order in the various phases of hard ellipses in this subsection .     of hard ellipses at @xmath80 for @xmath68 .",

    "4 that @xmath82 rapidly decays to the value of @xmath39 , indicating the absence of any long - range translational order even at the largest density studied .",
    "the reason , why we did not observe the formation of a translationally ordered structure for large aspect ratios , has been explained in section ii .",

    "meanwhile , we can study the bond - orientation correlation functions  @xcite , in order to quantitatively identify the location of the transition from the isotropic liquid to the hexagonal crystal .",
    "we first define the sixfold bond - orientation order parameter @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the number of the neighbors of the @xmath106th particle and @xmath107 is the angle between the vector @xmath108 and the @xmath109 axis . here , we define two ellipses to be neighbors if they overlap when uniformly expanding their sizes by @xmath110",

    "we thus use the criterion @xmath86 to separate the plastic states from the isotropic states for hard ellipses with @xmath62 . in the liquid phase , the system only exhibits short - range bond - orientation order and @xmath113 should decay exponentially . however , for high densities and especially in vicinity of the formation of the hexatic phase , we find that the bond - orientation correlation function can indeed be better described by the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) function @xmath117 with @xmath118 the static correlation length .",

    "we confirm the above claims by presenting the results of @xmath113 for a system of hard ellipses with @xmath85 in fig .",

    "the envelopes of @xmath113 can be well fitted by the oz function . with further increasing @xmath2",
    ", a power - law decay with an exponent of @xmath120 holds for the behavior of @xmath113 , indicating the emergence of quasi - long - range bond - orientation order .",

    "the values of @xmath122 for other aspect ratios are shown in fig .",
    "and we confirmed that the obtained value for hard disks ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) is in agreement with other studies within the simulation accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the above analysis indicates that hard ellipses for @xmath62 share the similar behavior with hard disks on the structure as well as the thermodynamics ( see discussion in subsection iii a ) .",
    "thus , the nature of the isotropic - plastic transition of hard ellipses should be the same as that of hard disks .",
    "turning to the orientational order of hard ellipses , we first focus on the nematic order parameter as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the 2d nematic order parameter is defined as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the angle characterizing the orientation of the @xmath106th ellipse with respect to the @xmath109 axis and @xmath87 the orientation of the nematic director .",

    "we show the results of @xmath88 for various area fractions for @xmath18 in fig . 7 as an illustration .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath88 shows extrema , and the absolute values of these extrema are the same ( we denote it by @xmath89 ) because of the periodicity of the cosine function in the definition of @xmath126 .",
    "we then use @xmath89 to quantify the nematic order of hard ellipses . in fig .",
    "8 , @xmath89 is presented as a function of @xmath2 for various aspect ratios and also shown as a contour plot in the plane of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "we find from fig . 8",
    "that @xmath89 is nearly zero at low densities and has clearly nonzero values at high densities for @xmath63 .",
    "thus , it appears that @xmath89 is more sensitive to the onset of the orientational order than @xmath26 . for @xmath75 , a clearly nonzero but still very small value of @xmath89 sets in above @xmath127 , implying the absence of any long - range orientational order .",
    "the quasi - long - range orientational order is expected to appear for systems of hard ellipses with larger aspect ratios , as confirmed by the results of @xmath89 for @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , the area fraction where the system starts to orientate becomes small as @xmath4 increases , revealing the fact that a system of more elongated hard ellipses has a stronger tendency to form nematic liquid crystals .",
    "it is interesting to explore whether @xmath89 is dependent on the system size in the nematic phase . unlike the order parameter @xmath26 computed from the tensor order parameter (",
    "dependence of the system size on @xmath26 has been confirmed by mc studies  @xcite ) , we find that the system size does nt strongly influence the value of @xmath89 for both the isotropic and the nematic phases studied ( see appendix b ) .",
    "hence , it is not proper to estimate the point of the i - n transition from the dependence of the system size on @xmath89",
    ". we can quantitatively determine the location of the i - n transition @xmath128 from the angular correlation function defined by eq .",
    "we mainly concentrate on the case of @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath130)>\\sim r^{-\\eta_{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath131 and the average is performed over all pairs with the distance @xmath101 .",
    "as introduced in section i , the stable nematic phase is then identified by a power - law decay with @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "the results of @xmath133 are shown for @xmath75 at @xmath80 in fig .",
    "consistent with the results of @xmath89 , we find that @xmath133 decays much faster than @xmath90 even at the largest studied density for these aspect ratios , indicating again there is no quasi - long - range orientational order in the system .",
    "the algebraic decay appears at high densities for @xmath63 , as evidenced in fig .",
    "10 for a system of hard ellipses with @xmath18 .",
    "we then use the power law @xmath134 to fit @xmath133 at @xmath135 and estimate the location of the i - n transition @xmath128 to be the area fraction when the value of @xmath136 is smaller than @xmath116 .",
    "again , @xmath128 obtained in this way is actually an upper bound to the exact value .",

    "as can be expected , @xmath128 decreases with increasing @xmath4 . comparing with previous mc results",
    ", we find that @xmath128 for @xmath18 obtained in this work is larger than that in ref .  @xcite but close to the result in ref .",
    "the reason , why the i - n transition was observed at a smaller area fraction by vieillard - baron , has been hinted by frenkel and eppenga  @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath18 , the value of @xmath128 for @xmath17 in this work is also a little smaller than that of ref .",
    "the slight difference between the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and ours is possibly due to the different particle number and different method used ( @xmath137 and @xmath14 mc in ref .",

    "our results also provide an opportunity to test theoretical predictions on the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath128 for hard ellipses .",
    "several theories  @xcite have predicted the occurrence of the i - n transition in hard ellipses . in particular",
    ", the onsager theory - based approach  @xcite and spt  @xcite predict that the relation @xmath139 emerges for sufficiently elongated hard ellipses . since the values of @xmath4 studied in this work",
    "are not large enough and the hard - needle regime has probably not been reached yet , such a relation can not well describe our results ( see the dashed line in fig .",
    "11 ) . instead , we find that a different form , @xmath93 with @xmath140 and @xmath141 adjustable parameters , provides a fairly good description of our data , as shown by a solid line in fig . 11 with @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "as mentioned in section i , the nature of the orientational order in the 2d nematic phase is also a central theme in the study of liquid crystals .",
    "the algebraic decay of @xmath133 already indicates the lack of the true long - range orientational order in the nematic phase of hard ellipses .",
    "we further confirm that the algebraic orientational order holds even for the largest studied density , as shown in fig . 12 , although @xmath133 may decay very slowly in this case .",
    "thus , our simulations strongly support that the nematic phase in hard ellipses has quasi - lro .    based on the above structural analysis",
    ", we present a phase diagram of hard ellipses and several representative snapshots in fig . 13 .",
    "our simulations show three different phases within the investigated state points . for @xmath62 ,",
    "the system has a transition from a low - density isotropic liquid to a plastic crystal at high densities [ fig .",
    "13(d ) ] . with increasing the aspect ratio up to @xmath16",
    ", we did not observe any phase transition within the whole density range studied in this work [ fig .",

    "13(e ) ] at sufficiently high densities . again",
    ", we confirm from the snapshot in fig .",
    "13(c ) that some short - range orientational order exists even in the isotropic phase of elongated hard ellipses . on the other hand , although the simulated phase diagram does not include any solid phase , we should stress again that hard ellipses do have the transition from an isotropic or a nematic phase to a solid phase , as revealed in previous mc simulations  @xcite .",
    "we even expect that a transition from a plastic crystal to a solid phase will occur for small @xmath4 values at even larger densities than @xmath80 .",
    "the reason why such a transition was not observed in our work , as explained in section ii , is due to the fact that a solid is hard to spontaneously form from a liquid in @xmath7 md simulations . on the other hand",
    ", it will be very interesting to explore the high - density part of the phase diagram for hard ellipses , where the stable crystalline phase will exist .",
    "in fact , our knowledge is very limited so far about the equilibrium structure of the solid in hard ellipsoidal particles , although it can be readily recognized that the densest packing of hard ellipses has the same density as the densest packing of hard disks and has a stretched triangular lattice structure  @xcite .",
    "however , such explorations are hindered by the present method .",
    "more elegant methods will be needed to clarify this issue , which remains a challenge from both theoretical and computational points of view .",
    "self - diffusion is of great importance in many real processes , but it is still poorly understood in hard ellipses .",
    "the diffusive property of hard ellipses with @xmath84 has been studied recently by experiments  @xcite and mc simulations  @xcite . yet , the effects of aspect ratio and area fraction on the self - diffusion of hard ellipses are unclear . in this subsection , we investigate in detail the self - diffusion of hard ellipses over a wide range of aspect ratios and area fractions , including the isotropic , plastic and nematic phases , and demonstrate the connections between the structure and the self - diffusion .",
    "we further discuss the relevance of our results to the glass transition in hard ellipses and provide the results of the isodiffusivity lines .     for three aspect ratios .",

    "the results of @xmath147 and @xmath148 are shown at @xmath80 for the plastic ( @xmath142 ) , isotropic ( @xmath16 ) and nematic ( @xmath18 ) phases of hard ellipses in fig .",
    "as can be seen , both translational and rotational motions of particles are ballistic at short times , and cross over into diffusive behavior at sufficiently long times in both the plastic and the isotropic phases .",
    "moreover , an apparent subdiffusive behavior is seen in the intermediate time regime of the translational msd due to the cage effect in the plastic phase [ see the solid line in fig .",
    "by contrast , the rotational diffusion of particles becomes extremely slow in the nematic phase , while the translational msd can still retain a diffusive regime at long times within the simulation time window ( see the dotted lines in fig .",
    "we have seen in subsection a that the above features shown in the particle motions may be responsible for the thermodynamics in the different phases of hard ellipses .     and ( b ) rotational diffusion constant @xmath149 as a function of area fraction @xmath2 for various @xmath4.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     as a function of translational diffusion constant @xmath150 for various @xmath4 .",
    "the green dashed line indicates @xmath151.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to better illustrate the effects of aspect ratio and area fraction on the self - diffusion of hard ellipses , we extract the translational and rotational diffusion constants from those of the corresponding msds retaining a diffusive regime .",
    "the results of @xmath150 and @xmath149 are shown in fig . 15 . at fixed area fractions",
    ", we observe that increasing @xmath4 leads to a slowing down of the rotational diffusion , while @xmath150 increases with aspect ratio .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of the phase transition seems not to affect these trends at least within the studied density range .",
    "then , a natural question is how self - diffusion responds to the phase transition . in a recent md study  @xcite",
    ", it was found for a system of hard ellipses with @xmath84 that if the diffusion constants are normalized by the values in the infinite dilution limit , then both diffusion constants still monotonically decrease with @xmath2 but the normalized @xmath150 will exceed the normalized @xmath149 at the area fraction where the i - n transition takes place , i.e. , the translational diffusion is enhanced with respect to the rotational diffusion as a result of the appearance of the quasi - long - range orientational order .",
    "we did nt observe crossing of the two normalized curves for the same aspect ratio by performing the same analysis ( data not shown ) . instead",
    ", our simulations reveal that the self - diffusion responds to the phase transition in a rather straight manner , which can be detected already in each curve ; i.e. , a sudden increase of @xmath149 is seen when a plastic crystal forms , as evidenced by a small peak in @xmath149 in fig .",
    "15(b ) , while the emergence of a nematic phase leads to an enhancement of @xmath150 although this observation seems to become less evident as @xmath4 gets smaller .",
    "the small peaks in fig .",
    "15 immediately indicate that the formation of the orientational or positional order will increase the translational or rotational mobilities of particles .",
    "hence , a phase transition in the translational degrees of freedom is reflected by a corresponding change in the rotational diffusion and vice versa .",
    "we thus uncover a clear connection between the structure and the self - diffusion in hard ellipses .",
    "it is interesting to further explore the effect of the particle s anisotropy on the self - diffusion in each degrees of freedom by plotting @xmath149 as a function of @xmath150 at varying @xmath4 . as shown in fig .",
    "16 , @xmath149 is larger than @xmath150 within the full density range for @xmath75 and the particles diffuse slower in the rotational degrees of freedom than in the translational degrees of freedom for @xmath152 .",
    "in addition , the curves show an upturn at high densities for @xmath75 , while they turn down for @xmath63 .",
    "this means that the translational mobility of hard ellipses will be similar with the rotational mobility at some aspect ratio between @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "if a glass is allowed to form in hard ellipses , we then expect that the rotational glass transition sets in at a lower density than the translational glass transition for @xmath155 , which was indeed observed recently in experiments of quasi-2d hard ellipsoids with @xmath156  @xcite . instead , the translational glass transition density will be smaller than the rotational one for @xmath157 .",
    "this immediately suggests that there is a point in the phase diagram of glassy hard ellipses , where the translational and the rotational glass transition lines will intersect .",
    "therefore , glasses in hard ellipses can be classified into three categories : a plastic glass in which dynamic arrest occurs in the translational degrees of freedom but the system behaviors as a liquid in the rotational degrees of freedom , a liquid glass in which the system becomes glass in the rotational degrees of freedom but the translational motions of particles remains ergodic , and a glass in which motions of the particles are dynamically arrested in both the translational and the rotational degrees of freedom .     and area fraction @xmath2",
    ". the solid lines are isodiffusivity lines from translational diffusion coefficients @xmath150 and the dashed lines are isodiffusivity lines from rotational diffusion coefficients @xmath149 .",
    "the green squares and the red circles indicate the locations of the isotropic - plastic transition and the isotropic - nematic transition , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another relevant property is the isodiffusivity of hard ellipses . as there are related results for hard ellipsoids of revolution  @xcite , we can evaluate such isodiffusivity lines for hard ellipses by proper interpolation and thus explore the qualitative effect of spatial dimension .",
    "we present the results of the isodiffusivity lines in fig .",
    "we find that an almost perpendicular crossing of the translational and the rotational isodiffusivity lines is shown in the plane of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the rotational isodiffusivity lines of hard ellipses reproduce qualitatively the shape of the i - n transition line at least for sufficiently small @xmath149 values , which is similar as the result in hard ellipsoids of revolution  @xcite .",
    "the latter observation indicates that the rotational motions of the ellipses is mostly controlled by the particle s anisotropy .",
    "on the other hand , the translational isodiffusivity lines in uniaxial hard ellipsoids mimic the swallowlike shape of the coexistence line between the isotropic liquid and the crystalline phase  @xcite , suggesting a non - monotonic change of @xmath150 with @xmath4 at fixed density ( see fig . 2 in ref .",
    "note that the swallowlike shape appears because there is a distinction between prolate ( rodlike ) and oblate ( disklike ) particles for hard ellipsoids , while such a distinction does not exist in hard ellipses since there are only two symmetry axes .",
    "our results , already apparent from fig .",
    "15 , show that @xmath150 monotonically increases with @xmath4 at fixed @xmath2 , which remains valid even when a phase transition intervenes .",
    "thus , it appears that the spatial dimension does influence the translational dynamics .",
    "however , it should be noted that our result does not rule out a non - monotonic dependence of @xmath150 on @xmath4 at even larger fixed densities than those presented in fig .",
    "in fact , our preliminary study for polydisperse hard ellipses ( which prevent the formation of crystal phases ) does show that the translational glassy dynamics depends on aspect ratio non - monotonically at large fixed densities .",
    "therefore , a common mechanism will be responsible for the translational glassy dynamics of hard ellipsoidal particles although different origins may exist at low densities .",

    "we have provided the results of the eos for a series of @xmath4 values and compared the simulations with a recent prediction of the spt in the isotropic phase .",

    "dependence of @xmath4 on the reduced pressure @xmath3 has been explored in the various phases . at large fixed area fractions",
    ", @xmath3 increases with @xmath4 in both the isotropic and the plastic phase , and interestingly , its dependence on @xmath4 is rather weak in the nematic phase .",
    "we rationalize the thermodynamics of hard ellipses in terms of particle motions , which show different features in different phases . for the static structures ,",
    "our simulations show that the plastic crystal forms for aspect ratios up to @xmath5 , while appearance of the stable nematic phase starts approximately at @xmath6 .",
    "the locations of the i - p transition and the i - n transition have been determined respectively by analyzing the bond - orientation correlation functions and the angular correlation functions and compared with previous simulations .",
    "we demonstrate that the i - p transition point increases with @xmath4 as the particle s anisotropy tends to destroy the positional order , while a larger @xmath4 leads to a smaller area fraction where the i - n transition takes place , revealing the fact that a system of more elongated hard ellipses has a stronger tendency to form nematic liquid crystals . in addition",
    ", our results strongly support that the 2d nematic phase in hard ellipses has only quasi - lro , as evidenced by the algebraic decay of the angular correlation function in the nematic phase .",

    "then @xmath179 and @xmath180 are used to compute the first - order time derivative of @xmath172 , which has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and reads @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the projection of the relative velocity at the contact point @xmath183 where @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 are the translational and angular velocities , respectively , and the cross product @xmath188 is defined as @xmath189 in principle , the contact time of two moving ellipses can be then numerically determined by using a newton - raphson method  @xcite .",
    "however , some numerical problems are probably met and some tricks must be employed .",
    "the reader can find more details in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the two ellipses @xmath164 and @xmath165 become externally tangent , their new translational velocities @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and angular velocities @xmath192 and @xmath193 can be exactly found from the conservation of total energy , linear and angular momentum .",
    "specifically , let @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 denote the translational and angular velocities of ellipses @xmath164 and @xmath165 before collision , their new velocities are updated by the following formula : @xmath198 @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201 where @xmath42 is the mass of the particle , @xmath43 is the moment of inertia , @xmath202 is the normalized common normal vector at the contact point , and @xmath203 is the momentum exchange during the collision , which is calculated according to @xmath204 meanwhile , the reduced pressure can be computed from the momentum exchange during a time interval @xmath205 : @xmath206    to accelerate the simulation , we use a neighbor list ( nl ) method . note that the nl method for hard ellipses is more complicated than that for hard spheres  @xcite , but",
    "the essence remains unchanged .",
    "and @xmath65 , effect of the system size @xmath8 on ( a ) reduced pressure , ( b ) nematic order parameter , ( c ) translational diffusion constant and ( d ) rotational diffusion constant .",
    "the results for @xmath17 in ( a ) are shifted up by @xmath60 for clarity , and the error bars in ( b ) correspond to the standard deviation over four independent samples .",
    "the system shows an isotropic phase in the whole density range in the case of @xmath16 , while the i - n transition occurs at @xmath127 for @xmath17.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in this section , we assess the effect of the system size . as introduced in sec .",
    "i , an analysis of the system - size dependence of the orientational order parameter is very useful especially in the 2d nematic phase .",
    "however , we also want to explore the influence of the system size on other quantities in order to confirm the validity of the conclusions given in this work .",
    "to this end , we also performed simulations of hard ellipses with @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath16 and @xmath65 .",
    "we have concluded in sec .",
    "ii that the system shows an isotropic phase at area fractions up to @xmath80 in the case of @xmath16 during the compression run , while the isotropic liquid transforms into the nematic liquid crystal at @xmath127 for @xmath17 .",
    "we find from fig .",
    "18 that the system size does not affect the above conclusion .",
    "in addition , all properties , including the reduced pressure @xmath3 , the nematic order parameter @xmath89 and the diffusion constants @xmath208 , do not depend on the system size within the statistical accuracy at least for the studied particle numbers . in particular",
    ", @xmath89 is also independent of @xmath8 even in the nematic phase of hard ellipses .",
    "this immediately indicates that the computed @xmath89 here is different from the order parameter @xmath26 obtained from the tensor order parameter , since previous simulations do show that @xmath26 decreases algebraically with @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can not determine the point of the i - n transition from the dependence of the system size on @xmath89 , although we have shown that @xmath89 is more sensitive to the onset of the orientational order than @xmath26 at fixed particle number .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "19 , the angular correlation function @xmath133 decays faster for larger @xmath8 in the nematic phase , but this feature seems to become less evident and even disappears as @xmath2 gets larger .",
    "however , the results confirm again that the nematic phase in hard ellipses does have only quasi - lro .",
    "note that the free energy density for a nematic liquid crystal in three dimensions is composed of splay , twist and bend energy terms and that each term is associated with a separate elastic constant , while the twist term is absent in two dimensions .",
    "since the three elastic constants are of the same order of magnitude in most cases , the free energy is often derived by assuming that the three elastic constants are equal .",
    "based on this so - called one - constant approximation , the resulting free energy has a very compact form and thus facilitates the theoretical analysis  @xcite .",
    "note that even if the term `` bond - orientation '' is used , the calculation of the bond - orientation correlation function is based solely on the centers of mass of the particles and thus it indeed measures the positional order ."
