    "the theory of synchrotron radiation ( sr ) is now a very well developed section of theoretical physics and is widely represented in numerous scientific articles , reviews [ 1 , 2 ] , monographs [ 3 - 6 ] and textbooks [ 7 ] .    in particular , in the classical theory of sr it is possible to find answers to basic questions in clear and analytical form and to propose algorithms for numerical simulation of the physical properties of sr : spectral - angular , spectral , angular distributions and polarization properties .",
    "the quantum theory of sr has also provided a number of significant achievements which have allowed the scope of classical theory to be clearly specified . moreover , with the use of the quantum approach it has been possible to predict the effects of radiation induced self - polarization of electron beams and the quantum excitation of synchrotron oscillations .",
    "both these phenomena where later confirmed experimentally .",
    "however , up to now we know of very few theoretical results describing the variation of the angular distributions of sr in regions where the quantum corrections can no longer be regarded as small .",
    "for example , in [ 8 , 9 ] quantum theory is used to study the sr of non - relativistic particles at low energy levels .",
    "it was shown that in the non - relativistic region the influence of quantum corrections is more noticeable the smaller the initial energy level of the particles .",
    "articles [ 10 - 12 ] also indicate areas of possible substantial manifestation of the quantum corrections for ultra - relativistic particles .",
    "the small number of papers on the theory of sr in regions where quantum corrections become significant is even more surprising , given that the spectral - angular distribution of sr in these areas is theoretically described by exact analytical expressions .",
    "the urgency to fill this theoretical gap rises from the fact that the parameters of modern accelerators are very close to the region where quantum corrections should be taken into account . in astrophysics ,",
    "sr is currently one of the main experimental sources of our knowledge about the physical processes in outer space and , without a doubt , the conditions of space sr can be properly understood only through the use of quantum theory .    here we investigate the main characteristics of the sr for particles in the first excited state , using exact analytical methods of quantum theory .",
    "in particular , comparative analysis of classical and quantum theory results is performed for angular distributions and radiation polarization .",
    "the energy @xmath0 ( where , @xmath1 is the rest mass , @xmath2 is the speed of light , and @xmath3 is the relativistic factor ) of a spinless particle ( boson ) subjected to an external constant and uniform magnetic field with intensity @xmath4 in the absence of motion along the field is given by [ 3 - 6 ] @xmath5 for a particle with spin 1 / 2 ( electron ) we have @xmath6where , @xmath7 corresponds to different energy levels , @xmath8 is the algebraic value of the particle charge , @xmath9 is planck s constant . in",

    "it is known [ 1 - 7 ] that the spectrum of synchrotron radiation is discrete , and for bosons and electrons with relativistic factor @xmath3 and with the energy level number @xmath11 , the possible frequencies of emitted photons @xmath13 are determined by the expression @xmath14where , @xmath15 is the number of the radiated harmonic , and @xmath16 is the angle between the external magnetic field and the direction of photon emission .",
    "it is not difficult to establish the inequality @xmath17 . when we consider @xmath18",
    "as functions of @xmath19 , then other fixed parameters of these functions are maximized at @xmath20 ( photon moves perpendicular to the magnetic field vector and parallel to the particle orbit plane ) and minimized at @xmath21 ( photon moves parallel to the magnetic field ) .",
    "when a particle is in the first excited state @xmath22 , only the first harmonic @xmath23 may be emitted and from ( [ 11 ] )  ( [ 13 ] ) we find for the electron @xmath24and for the boson @xmath25    in what follows , a detailed study of the main characteristics of sr for particles in the first excited state @xmath26 is performed . in this case , all particle radiation properties are determined by its angular distribution and polarization .",
    "polarization components of the sr will be labeled by the index @xmath27 and we choose a standard [ 1 , 5 , 6 ] labeling method : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the right and @xmath30 is the left circular polarization component ; @xmath31 is used for @xmath32 and @xmath33 components of linear polarization respectively ; @xmath34 denotes the total radiated power ( equal to the sum of the two linear or the two circular polarization components ) .",
    "in quantum theory , general analytical expressions for the spectral - angular distribution of the sr are known [ 1 , 5 , 6 ] and expressed in terms of laguerre functions , with complex dependence on @xmath35 . in the special case of @xmath36",

    "* 2*. first we should note the following remarkable feature . as follows from the second and third rows of the formulae ( [ 217 ] ) and",
    "( [ 221 ] ) , the function of angular distribution of the @xmath55component of polarization of sr for an electron with spin @xmath88 coincides exactly with the function of the angular distribution of the @xmath124linear polarization component of sr for an electron with spin @xmath87 .",
    "accordingly , the function of the angular distribution of the @xmath124component of linear polarization for sr of an electron with spin @xmath88 coincides exactly with the function of the angular distribution of the @xmath55linear polarization component for sr of an electron with spin @xmath87 .",
    "we can say that the angular distributions of linear polarization for an electron with spin @xmath88 and an electron with spin @xmath87 `` switch places '' .",
    "it is possible that this feature of the angular distributions for electron sr takes place not only for the initial state @xmath22 .",
    "this angular distribution feature of the linear polarization component of electron sr provides a physical explanation for the following known fact . in classical sr theory and quantum sr theory for spinless particles ,",
    "the emission of the @xmath124-linear polarization component is absent in the orbit plane @xmath125 ( according to these theories the radiation in this direction is completely linearly polarized and only the @xmath55component of linear polarization is emitted ) .",
    "this is not the case for electrons and quantum sr theory tell us that for spinor particles the emission of the @xmath124linear polarization component is not equal to zero at @xmath120 .",
    "this result was first obtained ( but has not been specifically emphasized ) in [ 13 , 14 ] , and in [ 15 ] this discrepancy with classical theory was first noted , but no physical analysis of this fact was carried out . only in [ 16 ] was such an analysis conducted . in particular , it was found that non - zero emission of the @xmath124component of linear polarization in the orbit plane is due solely to an electron transition with transverse spin .",
    "this fact can be used as a possible indicator of spin orientation . however , in [ 16 ] the possibility of the angular distributions between the linear polarization components `` switch places '' depending on the orientation of electron spin was not found .",
    "we established here that the linear polarization components of sr `` switch places '' , depending on the orientation of the transverse electron spin",
    ". this fact reveals a physical cause for the presence of the @xmath124linear polarization component of electron sr in the orbit plane .",
    "* 3*. the presence of a factor @xmath126 , defined by ( [ 218 ] ) , in the expressions for the power of electron sr , ( [ 217 ] ) and ( [ 219 ] ) , indicates that an electron with spin @xmath87 ( in this case , the radiation is accompanied by a spin flip ) always radiates @xmath127 times less than an electron with spin @xmath88 ( radiation without a spin flip ) .",
    "thus , spin - flip transitions are always @xmath127 times less probable than transitions without spin flip .",
    "since @xmath128then in the non relativistic approximation only electrons with spin @xmath129 emit , whereas electrons with spin @xmath87 in practice do not emit ( remain in a quasi - stable state ) . in the relativistic case",
    "@xmath130 the dependence of sr power on the spin orientation disappears ; transitions with and without spin flip are equiprobable ( however exchange of places between @xmath55 and @xmath124components of sr linear polarization , which depends on the initial spin state , is preserved at all energies ) .    * 4*. using ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 219 ] ) we find the ratio of the total radiated power of electron sr to the total radiated power of boson sr , when an electron and a boson in the initial state are at energy level @xmath22 and have the same energy @xmath131    numerical calculation , for which the results are summarized in table 1 , shows that @xmath132 . for the function",
    "@xmath133 we have : @xmath134 when @xmath135 and @xmath136 when @xmath137 .",
    "thus , an electron with spin antiparallel to the field emits at all energies almost four times more than a boson , and an electron with spin along the field begins to emit more than a boson only in the relativistic domain .",
    "the radiated power for electrons significantly depends on spin in the weakly relativistic region , but with increasing particle energy , this dependence disappears .     +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         * 5*. consider the energy dependence of the functions @xmath138 , which determine the polarization of the total radiation .",
    "graphs of these functions are shown in the figure 1 .",
    "a quite unusual feature of the case under consideration is that for the ultra - relativistic electron @xmath139 , according to the precise limits ( [ 223 ] ) , just the right - handed polarized radiation remains in the upper half plane ( in the ultra - relativistic limit , the left - handed polarized radiation in the upper half plane is vanishingly small compared with the right - handed polarized radiation ) .",
    "in contrast , in the lower half plane the right - handed polarized radiation is vanishingly small , and only the left - handed polarization is emitted .",
    "the preferential linear polarization is completely absent . for bosons ( also in classical theory ) , there is no such phenomenon .    in the entire field of finite energy , the degree of right - handed circular polarization in",
    "the upper half plane increases with energy for both the electron and for the boson ( whereas in classical theory it decreases ) .",
    "the degree of linear polarization of the electron and boson decreases with increasing energy ( in classical theory it increases ) .",
    "* 6*. the structure of the angular distribution functions @xmath64 and @xmath114 is illustrated in figures 2  9 , which demonstrate the evolution of these functions with particle energy .                    the dependence of functions @xmath140 and @xmath141 on @xmath77 has the simplest form ( see the fig.2 and 3 ) .",
    "moreover , both these functions are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath19 in the region of @xmath142 ( qualitatively this behavior is consistent with classical theory ) .",
    "function @xmath140 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath77 for each fixed @xmath16 , whereas in classical theory there is no such monotony .",
    "for function @xmath141 there is no monotonous behavior on @xmath77 , and though this shows the influence of particle spin , the behavior of the electronic functions is closer to classical theory than that of the bosonic functions .    the evolution of functions @xmath143 and @xmath144 is represented in figures 4 and 5 respectively .",
    "function @xmath143 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath16 in the @xmath142 interval for each fixed @xmath77 , whereas function @xmath144 is monotonically decreasing only for @xmath145 . for @xmath146 ,",
    "the functions are not monotonous any more , and an internal maximum point appears for these functions at @xmath147 .",
    "for this case , the behavior of the electron distribution functions is closer to classical theory compared to the boson ones .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the evolution of the functions @xmath148 and @xmath149 in the @xmath150 interval . from fig .",

    "approaches 0 in the @xmath155 interval , which corresponds to the disappearance of the right - handed polarization in the lower half plane .",
    "lastly , the distribution functions of total radiation @xmath156 and @xmath157 are shown on fig . 8 and 9 ,",
    "from which it follows that the bosonic function is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath16 in the @xmath158 interval ( qualitatively the behavior is contrary to classical theory ) .",
    "the behavior of electron functions is qualitatively closer to classical theory and for small @xmath77 these functions are monotonically decreasing . still for @xmath159 they lose monotony and there is an internal point of maximum for these functions at @xmath160 .",
    "figure 10 presents graphs of the functions @xmath161 . for @xmath162",
    "all the angles @xmath163 depend on @xmath164 in the following way @xmath165figure 11 shows graphs of the maximum value for @xmath166 .",
    "classical theory predicts the phenomenon of sr concentration at a narrow angle in the vicinity of the orbital plane for an ultra - relativistic particle .",
    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for this concentration is the tendency of angles @xmath167 to approach @xmath168 for @xmath169 .",
    "although for an electron ( and @xmath55components of the boson radiation ) this condition is satisfied , it is clear from the behavior of the functions @xmath64 and @xmath114 , shown in the fig.2  9 , that there is not a significant concentration of radiated power in the orbital plane ( in the vicinity of @xmath120 ) in this case , which contradicts classical theory .",
    "* 7*. lack of emission concentration in the vicinity of @xmath120 is also confirmed by the dependence of the effective angles @xmath170 on energy ( the notion of an effective angle for sr was introduced in [ 17  20 ] ) .",
    "figure 12 shows graphs of these functions , from which it follows that for @xmath171 these functions are weakly decreasing , tending to a finite value at @xmath154 . in the relativistic case ,",
    "an arbitrarily large concentration of radiation in the orbit plane does not occur , in contrast to the conclusions of classical theory .",
