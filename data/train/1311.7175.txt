    "via imaging , spectroscopy and time - series analysis , the microwave part of the spectrum provides vital information on the properties of flare - accelerated particles and the plasma and the magnetic field in which their emission is formed .",
    "although there are considerable complexities in modeling and interpreting the data , microwaves are uniquely rich in diagnostic information and are crucial for flare studies .",
    "however , flares are characterised in part by the fact that - for the few minutes of the impulsive phase at least - emission is generated across the entire electromagnetic spectrum",
    ". therefore we have the ability to set our microwave observations in context , though in practice the number of flares with excellent multi - wavelength coverage including microwaves remains small .",
    "this highlights the ongoing need for continued operation of facilities such as the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ) and radio polarimeters ( norp ) in the current era of multi - wavelength observations . in this short paper",
    "we will review some multi - wavelength flare observations , focusing on recent results relevant to the flare impulsive phase .",
    "these include hints of fine structuring in chromospheric footpoints , very compact footpoint sources , rapid changes in the tilt of the magnetic field during the flare impulsive phase , and hot chromospheric footpoints . in the light of these results we will speculate on what the combination of multi - wavelength and microwave flare data can potentially bring .",
    "the ` natural ' partner for microwave emission is hard x - rays , and an extensive review of the strengths of combining radio and hard x - ray data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the most directly interpretable signature of non - thermal electrons in solar flares are the non - thermal hard x - rays ( hxrs ) emitted in bremsstrahlung interactions , particularly in the dense plasma of the solar chromosphere .",
    "hxr emission from the chromosphere is usually interpreted in terms of the collisional thick target model ( cttm ) , which means that the emission is generated as electrons slow down , under the influence of collisions only , and stop within the target . to interpret a given observation in this way",
    "also requires that the slowing - down timescale ( fractions of a second ) is less than the integration time used to make an image or spectrum , which is generally the case . under the assumptions of the collisional thick target model",
    ", the total number of electrons that must be injected into the thick target to produce the observed spectrum can be inferred , in a way that does not depend on the precise density structure of the atmosphere . however , with imaging from the ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the density structure can be probed in more detail .",
    "the systematic offset of source position ( first moment of the source intensity distribution ) as a function of energy when interpreted in the cttm gives a value for the target density scale - height @xcite .",
    "the source full - width at half - maximum intensity ( 2nd moment ) as a function of energy can also be measured @xcite , and compared with the predictions of the cttm ; doing so is rather interesting as it is not possible to easily reconcile the modelled and observed behaviour of this quantity .",
    "the sources have a much larger observed fwhm than straightforward models of an electron distribution in a ` monolithic ' loop would predict @xcite .",
    "this may point to much finer sub - structure in the chromosphere composed of multiple sub - resolution structures of different density scale - heights , as shown in figure  [ fig : strands ] , such that the mean source position as a function of energy as expected from the cttm is preserved , but the ` variance ' is increased @xcite .",
    "the implication is that chromospheric sub - structures on scales of a tenth of an arcsecond or less could exist .",
    "the fine - structuring would presumably have a coronal counterpart .",
    "however , the result may also point to problems with the applicability of the cttm .",
    "( 80mm,40mm)kontaretal2010.eps    another important result to emerge from rhessi is the inference , using the photosphere s albedo to hxr photons , that the electron angular distribution where the hxr footpoint emission is produced is consistent with one in which as many electrons are traveling ` upwards ' as ` downwards ' @xcite .",
    "again this presents a challenge to the cttm .",
    "the possibilities of developing such an electron distribution from a combination of scattering ( collisional and non - collisional ) and magnetic mirroring in the chromosphere are still being investigated , but already it is clear that considerable fine - tuning of the electron , field and density parameters is needed to recover the observational results .",
    "the ongoing investigations into the causes of these observationally deduced properties of the electron spatial and energy distributions have yet to be concluded , but it is clear that a model of a downward - beamed ` monolithic ' electron beam entering a simple , uniform , collisional chromosphere , is not correct . the electron distribution looks likely to be finely structured in space , and probably also time ( though some average properties can be recovered ) , and may have a complex angular distribution .",
    "co - ordinated observations with flares in the optical also make clear that electrons arrive at the chromosphere over small patches .",
    "it is not clear that optical footpoints are resolved on a scale of 1@xmath0 @xcite , so the typical optical footpoint is more like @xmath1 , rather than the @xmath2 often used as a ` canonical ' footpoint size ( see section  [ sect : optical ] ) .",
    "this may have significant implications for the usual ` trap - plus - precipitation ' models used in microwave modeling .",
    "[ sect : optical ] optical , or ` white light ' flares , previously thought of primarily as accompanying large flares , are in fact common phenomena , but ill - understood .",
    "the flare optical and uv emission contains the majority of the flare s radiation output , and a wealth of spectral lines are available to probe the conditions in the flare chromosphere . for those reasons one would expect this part of the spectrum to have received more attention .",
    "however , optical flares are difficult to observe , as they have a low contrast compared to the bright photosphere , and spectroscopic observations require the good fortune to have a spectrometer slit on a flaring kernel at exactly the right time , which has in the past been rare . nonetheless broad - band optical emission is observed in flares from c - class to x - class .",
    "the key is to have stable , high - cadence imaging or photometric observations which can be used to perform reliable differencing observations to pick up the faint flare signatures against the bright photospheric background .",
    "doing this has revealed that optical footpoints are strongly correlated in space and time with hxr footpoints , and thus with the presence of large numbers of fast electrons @xcite and that optical footpoints are very compact , with areas of around @xmath3 or perhaps less .",
    "the energy contained in the white - light continuum is around 70% of the total flare energy , independent of the flare class .",
    "the emission mechanism of this broad - band optical radiation is not known .",
    "it seems unlikely that it is due to direct heating of the photosphere by electrons accelerated in the corona , as the typical electron energy required to reach the photosphere is around 2  mev , assuming a column mass to the photosphere of 1  gm  @xmath4 .",
    "an interesting recent analysis by @xcite of a limb flare observed by rhessi and also by one of the stereo spacecraft uses careful triangulation to place both the flare optical emission and the hxr emission at 30 - 50  kev at only 300  km above the photosphere .",
    "this corresponds to an electron stopping energy of around 1  mev .",
    "( this single observation has yet to be repeated ) . for the optical luminosity to be produced at or near the photosphere by electrons arriving in a beam from the corona , a large fraction of the electron energy in the injected spectrum would have to be above @xmath5  1  mev",
    "this is inconsistent with parameters for the electron distribution derived from hxr measurements .",
    "microwave and millimeter observations are informative here , as the emission is generated by electrons in the 100  kev - plus energy range , and it is interesting that these observations suggest that the spectrum may be substantially harder at energies above a few 100  kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than would be implied by the continuation of the hxr - emitting spectrum . however , this is still not adequate .",
    "for example , application of gyrosynchrotron models to microwave emission by @xcite for the large flare sol2002 - 07 - 23t00:35 ( x4.8 ) results in a non - thermal electron density distribution of @xmath6 , corresponding to an electron energy density above @xmath71  mev of @xmath8 if we assume @xmath9 g . this is far too small compared to the energy density of the photospheric plasma ( around @xmath10 ) to produce an observable optical intensity perturbation . for now the observation of @xcite remains a puzzle .",
    "another mechanism for producing optical emission is the free - bound continuum that results from the ionisation and recombination in a flare - heated chromosphere ( note , the heating can be , but does not need to be , provided by non - thermal electrons ) .",
    "the uv ( balmer and lyman ) continua may also penetrate downwards and backwarm the photosphere , effectively recycling this radiation as optical emission . by indirect means , optically thin emission has been deduced in one flare with an extended white - light ribbon @xcite .",
    "this would be consistent with free - bound emission from a hot plasma .",
    "the temperature of the emitting plasma should be high enough that the hydrogen is substantially ionised , i.e. above @xmath11k .",
    "the brightness temperature of the surrounding non - flaring chromosphere is also in this range , so associated microwave emission would not be visible unless the free - bound emitting plasma were hotter .",
    "moreover , in the free - bound model the electron density in the region emitting in the optical may be around @xmath12 @xcite , so any microwaves generated here with frequencies below the corresponding plasma frequency ( @xmath5 28ghz ) will not propagate .    although we do not expect to make direct microwave observations of the plasma that radiates the optical emission , the observed optical source properties , coupled with those inferred from hard x - ray spectra , have implications for beam parameters which should be recognised in future microwave modeling .",
    "the optical footpoint area is small , and in the event presented by @xcite it is consistent with an unresolved hxr footpoint size .",
    "interpreted in the cttm the _ non - thermal _ electron beam density at the location of hxr emission in this event is at least @xmath13 electrons  @xmath14 above 20  kev .",
    "this is consistent with the value inferred in another x - flare by @xcite from the microwave emission in another large flare , but this time in the corona , where the 17  ghz emission is located .",
    "if magnetic mirroring occurs , due to field convergence between the corona and chromosphere ( as one might expect given the increasing evidence for very small footpoints ) then the hxr - generating electrons in the chromosphere would represent only the component that can escape the magnetic trap , giving a lower limit to the overall non - thermal coronal electron density in the coronal loop . on the other hand",
    "if the electrons were beamed exactly along the magnetic field then there would be no trapped component and , in a field that diverges into the corona , the coronal beam density requirement would be reduced . but",
    "a highly - beamed distribution is at present inconsistent with the angular distributions inferred using photospheric hxr albedo ( section  [ sect : hxr ] . )",
    "such high beam densities challenge electron transport models , but may have some bearing on electron spectra relevant to microwave and x - ray comparisons , because beam - return current instabilities can substantially distort the electron spectrum . unless the background plasma through which the beam passes is much denser than the beam , such that the return current speed is low , the beam - return current system will be subject to plasma instabilities causing the majority of its energy to be dissipated as electron and ion heating , via wave generation .",
    "analytical considerations suggest that a beam with even a fraction of the density implied by the combination of x - ray and optical observations should , together with its return current system become unstable to the ion - acoustic instability ( when its return - current speed is greater than the ion - acoustic speed ) , with the beam energy redistributed in heating , unless the ambient density is much larger than the beam density @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the beam - return current system are now very elaborate , including vlasov and pic simulations , in magnetised and non - magnetised scenarios . for example , work by @xcite and indicates that the majority of the beam energy - around 70% - is redistributed as plasma heating , but that the remaining fraction may be available to re - accelerate higher energy electrons .",
    "this is interesting for the comparison between hxr and microwave radiation , since it suggests that the lower energy x - ray generating electrons and the higher energy microwave - emitting electrons need not be described by one spectral index .",
    "a number of joint studies of hxr and microwave flare conclude that there is a substantial difference in the electron spectral indices at low energy and high energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where microwave emission interpreted as optically - thin gyrosynchrotron radiation implies that electron spectra at high energies ( above @xmath15kev ) are substantially flatter than at low energies .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)petriesudolfig.eps    the impulsive phase of a solar flare has detectable consequences for the low solar atmosphere , i.e. the photosphere , apart from the possible photospheric origin for optical flares .",
    "it is now well established that significant abrupt ( step - like ) , non - reversing change in the line - of - sight photospheric field occurs for major ( x - class and m - class ) flares , co - temporal with the flare impulsive phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an example of such a change is shown in figure  [ fig : petriesudol ] .",
    "the location of this change can be in the umbra , the penumbra or elsewhere in the active region , and is co - spatial with increases in uv footpoint intensity @xcite .",
    "the onset of the goes soft x - ray emission leads the field changes @xcite as do peaks in the uv intensity - by on average 4 minutes @xcite . as remarked on by these authors , the timing pattern is consistent with the flare causing the photospheric field changes , and not vice versa .",
    "the hxr footpoints are associated with some , but not all , locations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though no systematic study of this has yet been carried out .",
    "the change of the line - of - sight field is taken as a sign that the coronal magnetic field is reconfigured by the flare , as shear relaxes or the field shrinks , and that this reconfiguration propagates through the atmosphere to the field s anchor points in the photosphere .",
    "the tendency is for the field to become more horizontal @xcite .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)tilt_angle_newcolour.eps    the change in the field direction over the duration of the flare impulsive phase corresponds of course to a variation in the viewing angle . since gyrosynchrotron emission from the high - energy non - thermal electrons which are also present during the flare impulsive phase is anisotropic this variation in the viewing angle will influence the microwave emission observed .",
    "we do not know of any comparisons yet being made between field changes and variations in the microwave , and indeed it might be difficult to disentangle variations due to changes in the magnetic field direction from those due to variations in the intrinsic properties of the population of emitting electrons .",
    "however , we can anticipate the effects . in figure",
    "[ fig : tilt ] we show the variation in the microwave spectrum as the viewing angle changes while all other parameters of the source stay the same . vertical lines on this plot",
    "show the norh observing frequencies .",
    "the emission is calculated for a non - thermal electron density of @xmath16 and electron spectral index of 3 in a compact source of diameter 5 \" , thickness 5000  km , and temperature 5mk in a magnetic field of 500  g and ambient density of @xmath17 .",
    "this could correspond to a gyrosynchrotron source near the footpoints of a coronal loop , or flare - heated upper chromosphere ( see section [ sect : hotfp ] ) .",
    "the three curves correspond to the same field strength , viewed at an angle to the field direction of 20@xmath18 , 40@xmath18 and 80@xmath18 .",
    "a decrease in the line - of - sight component of the field strength caused by an increasing field tilt leads to higher microwave intensity and an increase in the peak frequency .",
    "it would be interesting to search for a systematic effect such as this in the data , but in any such effort the many other parameters affecting the microwave spectrum must also be accounted for .",
    "[ sect : hotfp ]    ( 90mm,80mm)dems.eps    the chromosphere in solar flares is strongly heated .",
    "this is readily seen in e.g. euv images of flare ribbons which indicate plasma of at least a million degrees .",
    "however , it has been known at least since the days of _ yohkoh _ , though not widely appreciated , that more extreme plasmas exist in the chromospheric footpoints during the flare impulsive phase .",
    "impulsive soft x - ray footpoints observed via their bremsstrahlung emission by @xcite and , in a large sample by show temperatures close to 10  mk , and densities of at least a few times @xmath19 ( depending on assumptions about their size ) .",

    "direct density diagnostics for higher temperatures were not available .",
    "the gradient of @xmath21 for the footpoint is 1 in all cases studied ; we note that this is consistent with conductive heating balanced by radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "the consequences of these hot , dense compact footpoints for microwave footpoint emission have not been explored . in the usual microwave flare modelling , the characteristics of the _ coronal _ flaring source are carefully studied , e.g. the inhomogeneities of the coronal field or the effects of pitch - angle distribution of the electrons on the emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but the modelling assumes that footpoints are rather cool as well as dense , and microwave emission will thus be free - free absorbed .",
    "the hot footpoint plasmas that we find are essentially at ` coronal ' temperatures but located at chromospheric altitudes and with density and magnetic field strength higher than typically found in the corona .",
    "they would be expected to produce intense compact sources , with spectral properties similar to those computed for coronal loops , and dominating any coronal emission in their optically - thin ranges due to higher densities and fields .",
    "the high plasma densities might however lead to razin suppression at low frequencies . in figure",
    "[ fig : hotfps ] we show calculations of footpoint emission for different temperatures and densities in the ranges deduced from the euv observations .",
    "of course , the observations also suggest that the hot footpoint plasma would be very inhomogeneous , with temperature varying by a factor 10 over a distance of probably 1000  km or so .",
    "so these spectra are for the moment only indicative .",

    "the source angular diameter is 5@xmath0 and depth along the line of sight is 2@xmath0 , comparable to the depth of the chromosphere .",

    "the emission is mostly non - thermal gyrosynchrotron , and source intensity is determined mainly by the magnetic field strength , where stronger fields shift the spectrum peak towards higher frequencies with stronger emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the intensity in the norh range , and norp above 3.8 ghz , is rather insensitive to the different values of density and temperature used here .",
    "the exception is in the weak - field case where the emission is affected by free - free absorption and razin suppression .",
