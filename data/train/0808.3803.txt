    "many of high - energy theories of fundamental physics are formulated in higher - dimensional spacetimes . in particular , the idea of extra dimensions has been extensively used in supergravity and superstring theories .",

    ", there are many reasons to expect that in string theory the most natural topology for the universe is that of a flat compact three - manifold .    in topologically non - trivial spaces the periodicity conditions imposed on possible field configurations change the spectrum of the vacuum fluctuations and lead to the casimir - type contributions to the vacuum expectation values of physical observables ( for the topological casimir effect and its role in cosmology see refs .  ) . in the kaluza - klein - type models",
    "the casimir effect has been used as a stabilization mechanism for moduli fields which parametrize the size and the shape of the extra dimensions .",
    "the casimir energy can also serve as a model for dark energy needed for the explanation of the present accelerated expansion of the universe ( see refs .   and references therein ) .",
