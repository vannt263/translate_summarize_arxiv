    "scattering is one of the most important methods of observation of structural properties of matter @xcite .",
    "fractals , on the other hand , have in recent years received enormous attention as models for the structure of matter @xcite .",
    "thus the relation between the two is of very general interest , as it provides an essential connection between physical observables and the highly intriguing fractal geometry of matter .",
    "the first to consider this relation was probably berry @xcite , who calculated some important averages for scattering by a random self - affine screen , coining the term `` diffractal '' , for waves that have encountered fractals . in subsequent works",
    ", it was demonstrated that diffractals have properties that differ significantly from `` ordinary '' scattered waves . the central feature that distinguishes diffractals from ordinary wave fields ( where geometrical optics applies ) ,",
    "is that they are scattered by objects that have structure on all scales , in particular near their wavelength @xmath0 .",
    "this fact gives rise to various _ scaling laws _ of the diffraction spectrum , reflecting the fractal structure of the scattering object .",
    "in contrast , in scattering from crystalline material , characteristic interference ( bragg ) _ peaks _ are observed , which are related through their positions to the underlying crystal structure .    in a large variety of fields",
    "scattering processes can be described by a _",
    "fourier transform _ ( ft ) , which relates the scattering amplitude to some local density or potential .",
    "examples ( to be dealt with in some detail in sec.[methods ] ) include neutron and x - ray scattering @xcite , optical diffraction @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) @xcite , electron scattering @xcite , and helium scattering @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the ft is an approximation , but its generality and simplicity have rendered it by far the most widely used approach to scattering problems .",
    "the ft is applicable if multiple scattering and resonances can be neglected , which is typically the case under conditions of high incidence energy .",
    "a large bulk of literature , theoretical as well as experimental , exists on scattering in the ft approximation from _ random _ fractals .",
    "the well - known result is that the intensity @xmath1 decays as a power - law of the momentum transfer @xmath2 , with the exponent related to the fractal dimension @xmath3 of the scatterer @xcite .",
    "since they are naturally less abundant , much less attention has been devoted to the scattering from fractals which can be constructed by a deterministic set of iterative rules .",
    "scattering from such fractals , as well as randomized versions of them , will be the subject of this paper .",
    "the few examples include berry s @xcite above - mentioned work ; further , mainly in optics , calculations on wave transmission @xcite and fraunhofer diffraction @xcite , on cantor - bars , koch fractals or sierpinski - carpet like media ; in x - rays , numerical calculations on scattering by a menger sponge @xcite , and measurements on diffraction from cantor lattices @xcite .",
    "the most extensive treatment is probably due to allain and cloitre @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", these authors reported an optical diffraction experiment on deterministically generated cantor bars and vicsek fractals , and showed the resulting structure factor to be self - similar . in refs.@xcite , they analytically solved and discussed properties such as band structure and scaling , for the diffraction problem in the case of scattering from a class of fractals similar to those to be discussed here . however , their discussion is essentially limited to fraunhofer diffraction and does not include random fractals .",
    "diffractal scattering for probes such as he - scattering or mri appears not to have been discussed in the literature .",
    "thus , there seems to have been no general treatment of the diffractal - ft problem .    the purpose of the present contribution is to demonstrate that an exact solution for this problem is possible , in the case of scattering by objects on an iteratively generated _ fractal support _ ( see fig.[fig:2d - fractals ] for an illustration of the concept ) .",
    "the class of fractal objects that will be considered here are those that can be generated by a combination of dilations and translations .",
    "well - known examples of such objects include ( generalizations of ) the cantor set , vicsek fractal , and sierpinski carpet @xcite .",
    "an operator formalism will be introduced for this purpose in sec.[generation ] , which will allow the treatment of diverse scattering conditions .",
    "it will appear in secs.[simple]-[random ] that whereas some details of the diffraction spectrum are context - sensitive ( i.e. , determined by a form - factor ) , the overall structure is determined by a universal , context - independent scaling relation .",
    "this conclusion is unaltered ( sec.[random ] ) by the introduction of a fractal dimension - preserving randomness . following this finding , secs.[form],[sa - power ] attempt to address the connection between the results derived here for a somewhat artificial class of fractals , and the standard ( power - law ) expressions used to interpret scattering data from natural fractals , such as self - similarity displaying porous materials , aggregates , or ramified structures .",
    "the fractal scattering object can be generated in two essentially different ways : from bottom - up ( henceforth bu ",
    "iterative inflation ) or from top - down ( td  iterative refinement ) . in the former ,",
    "the smallest unit remains fixed , and structure appears at ever larger scales , limited of course by a natural upper cut - off .",
    "this structure is reflected at ever _ smaller _ scales in momentum space .",
    "a fixed point is reached where further spectral details are indiscernible , either due to experimental resolution constraints or when the wavelength becomes larger than the upper cut - off . to every iteration of the fractal support",
    "there corresponds a diffraction spectrum .",
    "subsequent diffraction - spectrum iterations may be equated when the fixed point is reached .",
    "the bu description is appropriate , e.g. , in the case of a fractal formed around a single nucleation center in a deposition process , as coverage is increased . in the td case ,",
    "the total system size is fixed and structure appears at progressively smaller scales , limited by a natural lower cut - off .",
    "this description is probably more appropriate for the physical formation of fractal structures by _ removal _ of material ( pore - fractals @xcite ) .",
    "if the wavelength @xmath0 of the incident waves is fixed , there will necessarily be another fixed point , where structure develops below @xmath0 , and further fractal details are indiscernible .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath0 becomes smaller than the lower cut - off . in both cases subsequent iterations of the diffraction - spectrum",
    "can then again be equated .",
    "consequently , in both bu and td cases , as will be shown here , the diffraction spectrum becomes ( approximately ) _ self - affine _ , and the self - affinity ( or hlder ) exponent is simply related to the fractal dimension of the scattering object . the central new result derived here is that this conclusion is unaltered neither by the physical identity of many scattering probes , nor by the introduction of a fractal dimension - preserving randomness .",
    "the purpose of this section is to summarize the relation between the structural properties of the scattering set and the observable diffraction spectrum , for various physical examples to which the ft is applicable .",
    "the ultimate goal is to show that in spite of the apparently very different way in which the interaction ( potential ) between the wave and the scattering object enters the formulation in each of the cases considered , there are certain universal features in the scattering intensities , which reflect only the underlying fractal geometry of the scatterer .",
    "the different examples are presented below in increasing order of computational probe - object interaction complexity .",
    "thus , whereas neutron scattering ( sec.[neutron ] ) involves merely a discrete fourier sum over the nuclear coordinates , electron scattering ( sec.[electron ] ) requires the ft of a potential which is a functional of the local electron density , and he scattering ( sec . [ he ] ) necessitates the fourier transformation of a functional of the interaction potential itself .",
    "yet , it should be emphasized that the results presented in this work , all pertain exclusively to _ local _ interaction potentials ( as holds for all the examples considered below ) .",
    "non - local potentials have been successfully considered in the literature as well , mainly in low - energy nuclear problems @xcite .",
    "notation and conventions : the momentum transfer is denoted by @xmath4 ; the scattering amplitude by @xmath5 ; spatial vectors by @xmath6 .",
    "elastic scattering is assumed throughout . as emphasized in each of the subsections below",
    ", the ft is essentially always the consequence of a high - energy approximation .",
    "neutrons may couple by virtue of their spin to magnetic moments .",
    "however , the interaction of interest in the present context , i.e , which gives rise to a fourier integral , is with non - magnetic material , where neutrons are scattered by the nuclei . due to the extremely short range of the strong force",
    ", this process is treated almost exactly in the born approximation .",
    "the neutron - nucleus interaction potential [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : born ] ) ] is essentially a delta function ( the `` fermi pseudo - potential '' @xcite ) , so that if the nuclear positions are @xmath7 , then    @xmath8    the accuracy of this expression depends on the extent to which one may neglect incoherent scattering due to isotopes , and inelastic diffraction due to variation of the structure with time ( thermal vibrations or atom diffusion )",
    ".      the well known laue derivation @xcite , yields the relation    @xmath9    between the local electron concentration @xmath10 and the x - ray scattering amplitude .",
    "the assumptions underlying the laue derivation are essentially that the polarization and electric field intensity are linearly and locally related by the dielectric susceptibility @xmath11 , which itself is frequency - independent .",
    "furthermore , at the inherently _ high x - ray frequencies _ , @xmath12 , which allows for a decoupling of the equations resulting from the attempt to solve the electromagnetic wave equation in the crystal lattice , and yields eq .",
    "( [ eq : x ] ) .",
    "the ft arises in optics in the case of fraunhofer diffraction .",
    "this holds when both source and observation point are located very far from the aperture , although some more general conditions exist @xcite .",
    "the fraunhofer formula results from the _ small - wavelength _ kirchhoff theory @xcite , which solves the wave - equation under huygens - fresnel boundary conditions .",
    "the assumed smallness of the optical wavelength in comparison with the dimensions of the diffracting obstacles implies that in optical diffraction , the bu fractal construction is more natural . essentially , fraunhofer diffraction occurs when a coherent light wave is scattered by an object with transmission function @xmath13 , and the light amplitude is obtained by a coherent superposition    @xmath14      suppose the local nuclear spin density in a sample is @xmath15 , and that an oscillating magnetic field with local larmor frequency @xmath16 is applied to it .",
    "it is conventionally assumed in mri that the larmor frequency is linear in the nuclear spin coordinates :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath19 is the polarizing field , much larger than the linearly varying gradient field , of which @xmath20 is the gradient . in practice",
    ", heterodyne mixing eliminates the term @xmath21 , and the integrated mri signal amplitude can be written as    @xmath22    a reciprocal space vector @xmath23 is introduced @xcite , showing that @xmath24-space may be traversed by moving either in time or in gradient magnitude , so that    @xmath25    eq .",
    "( [ eq : mri ] ) assumes _ rapid signal acquisition _ ( after the excitation pulse ) , so that spin relaxation , dipolar and scalar coupling , or spin translation , do not distort the signal .",

    "the he - surface scattering problem has been successfully treated within the sudden approximation @xcite , which assumes a _ high perpendicular momentum change compared to the momentum change parallel to the surface _ ( essentially a high energy approximation ) . under the presence of an arbitrary he - surface potential @xmath30 , the sudden approximation yields the scattering amplitudes as    @xmath31    where the phase - shift function is given in the wkb approximation by    @xmath32 - k_z \\xi({\\vec r } ) .",

    "effects such as resonances , multiple collisions and dynamic polarization are neglected . for a hard - wall potential",
    "@xmath38    so that from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) it follows that in this case :    @xmath39    as in the eikonal approximation in optics .",
    "having seen the generality of the ft in diffraction problems , the generation of the scattering fractal support is given next .",
    "the construction to be described below is in the spirit of the iterated function system formalism of barnsley @xcite .",
    "consider first as an introductory example the construction of a characteristic function on the usual ( ternary ) cantor set ( fig.[fig : cantor - step ] , left ) : one first contracts the generator ( zero - order iteration ) , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , by a factor @xmath42 , and then places one copy of the contracted version at the origin , and another translated by @xmath43 from the origin .",
    "this can be generalized to contractions by a factor @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and translations by @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding td _",
    "fractal operator _ is ( the reason for using the adjoint will become clear in sec.[simple ] ) :    @xmath47    where the _ translation operator _ is defined as    @xmath48    and the _ dilation operator _ is defined as    @xmath49    @xmath50 shifts the function it operates on by an amount @xmath46 to the left , and @xmath51 stretches the function by a factor of @xmath44 . when applied in the inverse sense as required by the definition of @xmath52 , it is easily checked that @xmath53 $ ] , and that @xmath54 is indeed an @xmath55 iteration stepped cantor surface , as illustrated in fig.[fig : cantor - step ] .",
    "barnsley @xcite and vicsek @xcite provide a general theorem for the calculation of the fractal dimension @xmath3 of such iteratively constructed fractals ; @xmath3 is the solution of the equation    @xmath56    where @xmath57 are all the contraction factors .",
    "thus in the present case :    @xmath58    to derive the algebraic properties of the above operators , it is convenient to express them in exponential form .",
    "@xmath59 has the well known momentum - operator representation    @xmath60    this can be used to find a similar representation for @xmath61 : let @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",

    "but this is exactly in the form of a translation , so that using the representation of @xmath59 one finds : @xmath67 .",
    "noting that @xmath68 , one obtains the desired representation :    @xmath69    from here , using @xmath70 and @xmath71 , it is easily seen that    @xmath72      the above formalism for _ td _ fractals can easily be extended to arbitrary dimension , as well as to _ bu _ fractals let @xmath73 be a vector in @xmath74 dimensions .",

    "( [ eq : p - int ] ) with constant integration limits , ensures that @xmath159 can be taken out and put in front of the integral .",
    "the _ he - scattering _ case [ eqs.([eq : sud - general]),([eq : eta ] ) ] is probably the most complicated , since there the fractal operator @xmath160 acts at several places simultaneously and @xmath155 is an integral operator with a functional limit .",
    "nevertheless , the covo commutation property and its corollary simplify the problem to the extent that @xmath159 may be pulled out again :    @xmath161    indeed , it should now be evident that this is the general structure of the ( local - potential ) diffractal - ft problem : the fractal operator can always be moved from the context - specific part ( @xmath162 ) to operate on the fourier basis - set , so that generically    @xmath163    this is the general structure of the fourier integral : a context - specific part embodied in the integrand of the form - factor , @xmath164 , and _ a generic part common to all diffractal - ft problems _ , found in the operation of the fractal operator on the fourier basis - set . what remains , in order to understand the universal scaling behavior , is to investigate this latter part .",
    "the fractal operators to be dealt with here are of the general form given in the td and bu cases ( eqs.([eq : fd - nd]),eq .",
    "( [ eq : gd ] ) respectively ) .",
    "the ensuing analysis closely follows along the lines of the simple , 1d case treated in sec.[simple ] .      repeating the 1d calculations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : apply - f ] ) , one finds that now the application of the fractal operator yields :    @xmath165    the normalization in the general case is to the relative volume occupied by the fractal , i.e. , @xmath166 , since there are @xmath167 fractal elements at the @xmath55 iteration , each with volume @xmath168 . introducing a form factor ,    @xmath169    the scattering amplitude assumes the following generic form :    @xmath170    thus the exact scaling relation for the intensities reads    @xmath171    and by employing the recipe used and justified in sec.[simple ] for 1d , of evaluating the exponential terms at @xmath172 , one obtains the approximate self - affinity relation    @xmath173    expressing this through the hlder exponent as in the 1d case , @xmath174 , one find that the universal relation between the self - affinity of the intensity spectrum and the fractal dimension [ eq .

    "in strict analogy to the results in 1d [ eqs.([eq : f^n - bu]),([eq : s - final - bu ] ) ] , one finds in the @xmath74-dimensional bu case :    @xmath176 e^{i { \\vec q}\\cdot{\\vec r } } , \\label{eq : g^n - dd}\\ ] ]    @xmath177 f({\\vec q } ) , \\label{eq : s - final - bu - dd}\\ ] ]    @xmath178    the normalization reflects that there are now @xmath167 elementary units at the @xmath55 iteration .",

    "interestingly , it thus appears that the embedding space dimension does not enter the scaling in the bu case .",
    "this fact remains to be explained on physical grounds . to visualize the features of the intensity distribution in this case , fig.[fig : self - affine : bu-2d ] displays 1d sections of the results of he scattering calculations from ag adatoms centered on a sixth generation sierpinski carpet with an underlying pt(111 ) surface ( bu version of fig.[fig:2d - fractals ] ) .",
    "these results were obtained by employing eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - final - bu - dd ] ) for the structure factor , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : s0-final - bu - dd ] ) for the form factor .",
    "the latter was calculated in the sudden approximation with a realistic he / ag / pt potential @xcite for @xmath181 $ ] .    to summarize",
    ", it was shown that irrespectively of the nature of the probe , for the scattering of a coherent wave by a deterministic fractal support , the intensity spectrum is approximately self - affine , with a hlder exponent trivially related to the fractal dimension of the support .",
    "the next generalization , necessary to approach realistic situations , concerns the effect of randomness .",
    "realistic fractals always contain some element of randomness @xcite .",
    "for example , in dla @xcite the adsorbing particles perform a random walk and the resulting fractal is consequently random .",
    "thus it is of major interest to introduce some randomness into the fractals under consideration , and to investigate its effect on the conclusions reached so far regarding the scaling properties of the intensity distribution . in order to meaningfully introduce randomness ,",
    "it is useful to _ preserve the fd of the support_. otherwise the fractal dimension is not a useful descriptor of the scattering object .",
    "this preservation of the fractal dimension can be achieved by keeping the constant , single contraction factor , but allowing for a _ distribution of translations_. the translations will be chosen independently from a given , but arbitrary , probability distribution @xmath182 , with normalization    @xmath183    for each @xmath184 . here , as before , @xmath184 is the iteration and @xmath185 the translation - number index .",
    "the results will of course have to be averaged over the disorder ensemble , denoted by @xmath186 and defined as mean values over all possible sets @xmath187 .",
    "care must be taken to apply this averaging to the observable _ intensities _ ( and not the amplitudes ) , since physically , one measures the intensities from a given realization of the disorder , and averages over the different measurements .",
    "thus :    @xmath188    in order to visualize the resulting random fractal , it is useful to return momentarily to the hard - wall , stepped surface language of sec.[simple ] : the support with randomized translations has steps of constant width as basic building blocks , but these are spaced randomly over an underlying `` cantor grid '' . due to the unequal translations , however",
    ", overlaps of steps may now appear , as illustrated in fig.[fig : cantor - step ] .",
    "it will be shown next that in the present randomized case , again the intensity spectrum is self - affine , with the same relations between hlder exponent and fractal dimensions as for the non - random situation .",
    "the change from the deterministic case is that now the fractal operator is given by    @xmath189    where the random shifts @xmath190 are chosen from @xmath191 .",
    "since one still has two identical contractions , the fractal dimension is unchanged [ eq . ( [ eq : d - here - nd ] ) ] , as required .",

    "to conclude , translational randomness alone appears to have no effect on the scaling properties of the diffraction spectrum .",
    "the diffraction spectrum is characterized by more than just its scaling properties . such features are discussed next .",
    "so far , most of the discussion has centered around the universal scaling properties of the diffraction spectrum , which were completely determined by the `` kinematic '' structure factor .",
    "however , the role of the `` dynamic '' form factor can not be ignored in discussing the properties of the spectrum .",
    "it is in this respect that the different physical probes discussed in sec.[methods ] differ , and that universality is broken .",
    "the form factor embodies the details of the interaction between probe and scatterer , and through it the potential enters the intensity spectrum .",
    "the example of he scattering will serve to illustrate the point . in this case",
    ", the he / surface interaction potential enters in a highly non - trivial way [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta ] ) ] .",
    "one of the striking consequences is the appearance of `` rainbow '' peaks in the diffraction spectrum @xcite .",
    "these arise essentially whenever a he atom is scattered from an inflexion point of the potential ( corresponding to maximal force applied to the atom ) , typically due to an adsorbed cluster .",
    "following is a brief discussion of the origin and physical significance of rainbows ( see ref.@xcite for a more extensive treatment ) .",
    "it is useful to employ a stationary phase , approximate evaluation of the sudden approximation scattering amplitude , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sud - general ] ) . in 1d ,",
    "the stationary phase condition is :    @xmath206    which yields @xmath207 .",

    "( [ eq : s - classical ] ) , this shows up as a singularity in the intensity distribution , at momentum transfer @xmath211 satisfying the stationary phase condition [ eq . ( [ eq : x(q ) ] ) ] together with @xmath210 .",
    "the singularity of this crude classical evaluation is smoothed into a finite peak in the more refined sudden approximation calculation .",
    "such sudden approximation calculations were performed for an ag / pt(111 ) bu sierpinski carpet system , with a realistic potential , described in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : self - affine : bu-2d ] ( fractal system ) and fig.[fig : rb ] ( rainbow analysis for a single adsorbate ) .",
    "it appears that , although for a single adatom the rainbow peaks are a dominant feature ( fig.[fig : rb ] ) , in the case of a fractal system , their role is rather negligible in determining the structure of the spectrum ( fig.[fig : self - affine : bu-2d ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is that they are far too broad to appear as individual peaks , along with those due to the fractal support .",
    "the rainbows , as well as all other features of the form factor , act as very broad _ envelopes _ to the detailed spectral structure .",
    "the main effect of the form factor is to provide an overall intensity decrease , without in any way significantly altering the details of the structure factor . since in practice one",
    "measures the full intensity distribution , this can have an effect on its self - affinity properties , and for a bu fractal care should be taken to divide by the form factor .",
    "similar results are expected to be found in the diffraction spectra of other probes , where dynamical factors play an important role , but can not lead to very peaked spectral features .",
    "consider the conditions for maxima derived from the scattering amplitudes for td and bu fractals [ eqs.([eq : s_n(q)]),([eq : s - final - bu - dd ] ) ] .",
    "for td fractals , the condition is    @xmath212    whereas for bus , it is    @xmath213    here @xmath214 and @xmath215 are integers , and @xmath216 .",
    "these are the `` bragg conditions '' for iteratively generated fractals . however , since one can not speak of a conventional unit cell with primitive lattice vectors in the fractal context , the present conditions for maxima are rather different from those for periodic crystals . for 1d cantor - like sets , eqs.([eq : bragg - td]),([eq : bragg - bu ] ) reduce to :    @xmath217    considering first the td case , the maxima occur for those @xmath2 s which , when multiplied by @xmath218 , are always integer multiples of @xmath219 . for the ternary cantor set ( @xmath220 ) , with @xmath221 , these @xmath2 s are all the integer multiples of @xmath222 . for @xmath44",
    "equal to an arbitrary _ integer _",
    ", these are the integer multiples of @xmath223 . for @xmath44 non - integer ,",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "cast in the usual bragg condition language , @xmath224 would be an effective `` lattice constant '' .",
    "the meaning of this number in the present context , is similar : it is the length of the elementary building block of the fractal at the @xmath55 iteration : the union of adjacent narrow black and white bars in fig.[fig : cantor - step ] ( left ) .",
    "however , larger structures also repeat themselves in the fractal , with smaller frequency .",
    "these give rise to the secondary maxima in fig.[fig : self - affine ] , and mathematically correspond to those @xmath2 s which yield integer multiples of @xmath219 for only a subset of @xmath218 .",
    "the incommensurability of these varying - scale , repeating structures , is what yields the multitude of peaks in the spectrum , as opposed to just bragg peaks in the case of a periodic crystal , and is ultimately responsible for the self - affinity of the spectrum .",
    "the more general conditions eqs.([eq : bragg - td]),([eq : bragg - bu ] ) , can be interpreted in a similar fashion .",
    "the distinction between the bu and td cases is straightforward : the peak spacings in the former tend to zero ( with the peak nearest to the specular found at @xmath225 ) , whereas in the latter the spacing is unbounded . the only limitation on the position of the furthest _",
    "observable _ peak in the td case is energy conservation . in both cases , however , the structure factors are invariant under a combination of translations and dilations ( apart from the reduction in intensities , responsible for the self - affine properties ) .",
    "one is thus led to define a new basis of primitive vectors for the reciprocal space , from which a brillouin zone can be constructed . as seen in fig.[fig : self - affine ] , the regions connected by these operations do not overlap , and can be considered as separate _",
    "bands_. a detailed treatment of this point is given in ref.@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the common wisdom relating to scattering by _ random _ fractal objects ( e.g. porous solids @xcite ) , amply confirmed experimentally , is that close to the specular the intensity satisfies a power law :    @xmath226    with @xmath227const .",
    "this power - law decay is clearly very different from the self - affine intensity spectrum predicted here for iterative fractals . considering the unquestionable experimental evidence for the power - law ,",
    "this discrepancy calls for clarification .",
    "the following arguments may shed some light on this issue .    in order to derive the power - law [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : power ] ) ] , one typically starts with the definition of a `` mass fractal dimension '' , describing the scaling of the mass @xmath228 enclosed in a sphere of radius @xmath229 , centered at an arbitrary point in the fractal :    @xmath230    if the fractal is self - averaging ( an assumption which is implicit in the derivation of , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) , then this mass is related to the pair distribution function @xmath231 by    @xmath232    with @xmath74 the embedding space dimension and @xmath233 the average density . from general scattering theory it is known that the structure factor is    @xmath234 e^{i { \\vec q } \\cdot { \\vec r } } d^dr .",
    "\\label{eq : s(q)}\\ ] ]    from here one arrives at eq .",
    "( [ eq : power ] ) ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "it is thus seen that the crucial assumption invoked in this derivation is the scaling law eq .",
    "( [ eq : n(r ) ] ) .",
    "it must be realized , however , that this expression is in many cases only true _ on average_.",
    "this can be seen very clearly for the ternary cantor set ( fig.[fig : cantor - step ] ) .",
    "suppose the set has bars of unit height and one calculates its cumulative mass @xmath235 in the @xmath236 iteration , starting from the left , and in terms of the number of black bars .",
    "then the following recursion formula may easily be verified :    @xmath237 \\ }",
    "\\cup \\ { n^{(j)}_l + [ { \\rm last}(n^{(j ) } ) ] \\}_{l=1}^{\\left|n^{(j)}\\right| } \\:\\:\\:\\:\\ : n^{(0 ) } = \\{1\\ } .",
    "\\label{eq : recursion}\\ ] ]    here @xmath238 is the length of the sequence @xmath235 and last@xmath239 is its last term . indeed , the zeroth - iteration ternary cantor set consists of 1 black bar , the first iteration has a cumulative mass of @xmath240 black bars , the second iteration has mass @xmath241 , etc . in fig.([fig : sa - power ] ) , @xmath242 is displayed on a log - log plot , together with the power - law @xmath228 [ as suggested from eq .",
    "( [ eq : power ] ) ] , i.e. , a line with slope ln2/ln3 , the fractal dimension of the ternary cantor set .",
    "it can be seen that this line serves as an accurate _ envelope _ to the actual @xmath228 , which is in fact a `` devil s staircase '' , with a very rich ( fractal ) structure .",
    "this example illustrates the general situation : a simple scaling law of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : power ] ) is only an _",
    "average _ representation of the actual cumulative mass function of a fractal , which may in fact not be self - averaging . since in this work the exact properties of the fractal [ i.e. , equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : recursion ] ) ] were used to calculate the scattering intensities , it should now come as no surprise that the resulting diffraction spectra themselves displayed the full , rich structure of the scattering fractal object .",
    "conversely , had the power - law form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : power ] ) been used in the present scattering calculations , the result would have been a power - law decay of the intensity .",
    "why then do experiments from natural fractals yield the power - law ?",
    "the preceding arguments strongly suggest that this is related to an averaging process which smoothes the fine - structure of the intensity distribution .",
    "a priori , two types of averages could be considered : ( 1 ) over the position of the center point of the cumulative - mass calculation , and ( 2 ) over the disorder ensemble .",
    "the first type can be ruled out immediately , however , since it is common to both the power - law and self - affine spectra derivations : the calculation of an _ intensity _ involves a double integral in which _ all _ pairs of points appear in the form @xmath243 n(r)\\,n(r')$ ] .",
    "this automatically performs the first type of average .",
    "thus , by elimination , the ensemble average appears to be responsible for smoothing out the self - affine properties into a simple power - law decay .",
    "indeed , in the deterministic iterative fractals considered here , there is of course no ensemble to average over , in contrast to the typical experimental situation .",
    "interestingly , the random fractals of sec.[random ] are `` not random enough '' , since they also display a self - affine spectrum .",
    "the type of randomness encountered in experiments yielding the power - law must lead , in contrast , to self - averaging between the physical cut - offs .",
    "there is a further difference between the randomness considered here and that encountered in experiments , namely that in the latter the randomness does not preserve the fd above the upper cut - off .",
    "in contrast , the type of randomness considered in this work preserves the fd on all scales .",
    "it is possible that this difference plays a role in creating the discrepancy between the experimental power - law results and the theory presented here .",
    "in summary , the diffractal - fourier transform problem , for scattering of coherent waves from a wide class of iteratively constructed fractals , was solved analytically , yielding the scaling properties of the diffraction spectrum .",
    "the class of fractals considered here is not that which is typically observed in scattering experiments , and is characterized by a self - affine intensity spectrum .",
    "a simple relation was found to exist between the self - affinity exponent of this spectrum and the fractal dimension of the scattering fractal support .",
    "in contrast , many experiments yield intensity distributions characterized by a power - law decay . it is argued here that this is predominantly the result of scattering from _ self - averaging _ random fractals , which are more abundant in experimental realizations of fractality .",
    "the results apply to a large variety of scattering probes , from neutron to he scattering , the condition being the applicability of the fourier transform .",
    "the differences among the probes are contained in a form factor , which , however , does not seem to have an important role in determining the details of the diffraction spectrum .",
    "it would be of interest to see whether scattering from non - self - averaging ( random ) fractal systems will yield a self - affine intensity spectrum as predicted here .",
    "further theoretical work will concentrate on generalizing the types of randomness studied here , and on investigating the possible role of cut - offs in leading to the power - law decay of the intensity observed in many experiments .",

    "<S> the diffraction spectrum of coherent waves scattered from fractal supports is calculated exactly . </S>",
    "<S> the fractals considered are of the class generated iteratively by successive dilations and translations , and include generalizations of the cantor set and sierpinski carpet as special cases . </S>",
    "<S> also randomized versions of these fractals are treated . </S>",
    "<S> the general result is that the diffraction intensities obey a strict recursion relation , and become self - affine in the limit of large iteration number , with a self - affinity exponent related directly to the fractal dimension of the scattering object . </S>",
    "<S> applications include neutron scattering , x - rays , optical diffraction , magnetic resonance imaging , electron diffraction , and he scattering , which all display the same universal scaling . </S>"
