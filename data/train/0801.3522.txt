    "i will exemplify their incorporation within the skyrme model .",
    "there is a serious problem for computing properties of resonances soliton models .",
    "commonly the coupling of resonances to mesons is described by a yukawa interaction of the generic structure @xmath3 \\sim g\\ , \\int d^4x\\ , \\bar{\\psi}_{b^\\prime}\\,\\phi\\,\\psi_b\\ , , \\label{eq : yukawa}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the resonance that might decay into the ( ground ) state @xmath5 and meson @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a coupling constant .",
    "it is crucial that this interaction is _ linear _ in @xmath6 ! if @xmath6 is pseudoscalar , this interaction yields the decay width ( residuum of the scattering amplitude ) @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the momentum of the outgoing meson .",
    "soliton models , however , are based on action functionals of _ only _ meson degrees of freedom , @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "they contain classical ( static ) soliton solutions , @xmath11 , that are identified as baryons whose interaction with the mesons is described by the ( small ) meson fluctuations about the soliton : @xmath12 . by pure definition of the stationary condition , the expansion of @xmath13 $ ] about @xmath11 does not have a term that is linear in @xmath6 to be interpreted as yukawa interaction , eq .",

    "thus @xmath20 contains all large@xmath15 information about the contribution of resonances to scattering data .",
    "the large@xmath15 expansion is systematic but a low order truncation is not necessarily reliable at the physical point and it is very challenging to reliably compute subleading contributions .",
    "presumably resonance exchanges contribute significantly in that regime .",
    "to probe the reliability of the computed resonance contributions we transform the above statement into a consistency condition : for @xmath19 any valid computation of hadronic decay widths in soliton models _ must _ identically match the result obtained from @xmath20 .",
    "unfortunately , the most prominent baryon resonance , the @xmath21 isobar , becomes degenerate with the nucleon as @xmath19 .",
    "it is stable in that limit and its decay is not subject to the just described litmus  test .",
    "the situation is more interesting in soliton models for flavor @xmath22 . in the so  called rigid rotator approach ( rra ) , that generates baryon states as ( flavor ) rotational excitations of the soliton , exotic resonances emerge that dwell in the anti ",

    "when @xmath19 the mass difference between anti  decuplet states and",

    "so the properties of @xmath23 predicted from any model treatment must also be seen in the quantizing of the strangeness degrees of freedom based on the harmonic approximation , @xmath20 .",
    "this ( seemingly alternative ) quantization is called the bound state approach ( bsa ) for reasons that will become obvious later . the above discussed litmus ",
    "test requires that the bsa and rra give identical results for @xmath23 as @xmath19 .",
    "this did not seem to be true and it was argued that the prediction of pentaquarks would be a mere artifact of the rra  @xcite .",
    "we will show that this conclusion is premature .",
