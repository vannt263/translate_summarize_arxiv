    "the europium chalcogenides eux , with x = o , s , se and te , formed the subject of many studies for more than forty years .",
    "they are magnetic semiconductors and one of the early motivation was the hope of using these materials as magneto - optical memories in the computers and magneto - optical modulators",
    ". moreover , the europium monochalcogenides are face centered cubic materials that are ideal examples of heisenberg exchange model and thus formed good exemplary substances for studying magnetism .",
    "in such a motivated background experiments were performed to study their properties and use them for practical purposes . though apart from various dopings and substitutions , it turned out that the ordering temperature could not be raised up to room temperature . also , these materials were found difficult to prepare .",
    "but , despite such difficulties , the studies on these materials attracted attention from a more academic point of view as it highlighted many interesting physical properties .",
    "for example @xcite , a metal - insulator transition in eu - rich euo has been observed while red - shift of the absorption edge , faraday rotation , circular dichroism and spin polarization explained magnetic and magneto - optical effects .",
    "such interesting properties have not only provided the motivation for theoretical and experimental investigations on these materials , but further studies on them permit a better understanding on more complex systems like the diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) which are believed to be one of the essential materials behind the technology called spintronics @xcite . + the motivation behind such a study is to combine many body theoretical analysis with bandstructure calculations for real materials . the goal is to study the temperature dependent electronic correlation effects in the valence bands of eus .",
    "a similar study has been carried out earlier for the conduction bands of eus @xcite but under a different kind of a theoretical approach .",
    "the chalcogenide , eus , was under a lot of experimental and theoretical investigation to study its magnetic and electronic properties , starting from early 1960s which reported nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite till the latest being on eus thin films @xcite while the list remains extensive .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section * [ sec : th - mo - cal ] * , we formulate the complete multi - band hamiltonian .",
    "a self energy ansatz , reliable for low carrier densities , is used to solve the model hamiltonian .",
    "the temperature and spin dependent density of states ( dos ) are presented for two weakly hybridized bands in a simple cubic lattice with coupling strength , hybridization and magnetization being the parameters for the model study . the results are then compared with one of the exact limiting cases of the model , namely the ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor and are found to be coinciding . in section * [ sec : recal - eus ] * , such a many body model is combined with first principles t=0 band - structure calculation , tight binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) , in order to calculate some of the physical properties like quasi - particle density of states ( q - dos ) , spectral density ( sd ) and quasi - particle band structure ( q - bs ) for realistic ferromagnetic semiconducting material eus . the final section * [ sec : con ]",

    "the multi - band kondo lattice model ( klm ) hamiltonian reads as follows ; + @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 the term @xmath4 denotes the kinetic energy of the valence band electrons , 3@xmath0 orbital in case of eus , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the fermionic creation and annihilation operators , respectively , at lattice site @xmath7 .",
    "the latin letters ( i , j , ... ) as subscripts , symbolize the crystal lattice indices while the band indices are depicted as superscripts in greek letters ( @xmath8,@xmath9 , .. ) and the spin is denoted as @xmath10 .",
    "such a notation is used throughout the text .",
    "the multi - band hopping term , @xmath11 , is connected by fourier transformation to the free bloch energies @xmath12(@xmath13 ) @xmath14 @xmath15 is an intra - atomic exchange interaction term being further split into two subterms .",
    "the first describes the ising type interaction between the z - component of the localized and itinerant carrier spins while the other comprises spin exchange processes which are responsible for many of the klm properties .",
    "j is the exchange coupling strength which we assume to be @xmath13-independent and @xmath16 refers to the localized spin at site @xmath7 @xmath17 the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "provokes a nontrivial many body problem that can not be solved exactly .",
    "approximations must be considered .",
    "we proceed to solve the problem by the equation of motion method using double - time retarded green function @xcite @xmath18 where l , m and @xmath19,@xmath20 are the lattice and band indices respectively .",

    "actually , in case of realistic calculations of eus , the coulomb interaction is implicitly taken in the lsda bandstructure calculations .",
    "so , the single particle excitation energies contain the coulomb interactions and need not be taken into account in the self energy ansatz .",
    "thus , the criterion required by our multi - band electronic self energy is that it should be accurately defined in the low carrier density regime and weak coupling strength , which is the case for the study of magnetic semiconductors .",
    "+ it is known that the above statements can be satisfied by the interpolating self energy ansatz ( isa ) being proposed for a single band model @xcite .",

    "though it is not self - evident in case of multi - band situation that these confining cases would hold true , nevertheless we propose to replace the single particle green function for the multi - band case by the respective matrix green function .",
    "as seen in theoretical analysis given in appendix  [ app : fss ] , the important case of ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor gives the same self - energy ansatz as in the single band case ( eq.(26 ) and eq.(27 ) in ref .",

    "as seen in eq .  , we are interested only in the local self energy @xmath35 the physical reason for the wave - vector dependence of the self energy is mainly due to the magnon energies @xmath36 appearing at finite temperature .",
    "but , as stated earlier , we neglect a direct heisenberg exchange between the localized spins and this can be interpreted as the @xmath36 @xmath37 0 limit .",
    "the localized magnetization @xmath38 shall be considered as an external parameter being responsible for the induced temperature dependence of the band states .",
    "+ in principle , apart from the above discussed proposal one could also consider other alternative approaches for the many body analysis like the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) in order to study the correlation effects .",
    "but , it is known @xcite that the methods of dmft can not be directly applied to the kondo lattice model .",
    "one exception is the case of the classical spin limit , thus removing the quantum nature of the spins . while there is another possibility to derive a dmft for kondo lattice model , based on the fermionization of the localized spin operators as suggested in @xcite , but it is limited to s=@xmath39 . recently , in an article @xcite , the correlation effects were discussed by introducing dmft based approaches but for a single band kondo lattice model and with an evaluation compared with the exactly solvable limiting cases and several other known approximate methods .",
    "+ considering our multi - band electronic self energy ansatz , we proceed to perform a model calculation of two weakly hybridized bands on a simple cubic ( sc ) lattice where the terms in the ( 2 x 2 ) hopping matrix , @xmath40 , are taken using the sc bloch density of states ( dos ) in the tight binding approximation @xcite .",
    "we assume the bandwidth ( w ) of both the bands , i.e intra - band transfer energy to be 1.0 ev while that for inter - band to be 0.10 ev . the center of gravity of one of the free bloch band is chosen to be energy zero while for the other it is taken as 0.25 ev .",
