    "early type ( elliptical ) galaxies in any given cluster have a similar color almost independent of their magnitude .",
    "if a color - magnitude diagram is constructed using two filters that span the rest - frame @xmath3 break , cluster early - types form a distinctive red sequence comprised of the brightest , reddest galaxies at a given redshift .",
    "clusters can therefore be detected as overdensities in a simultaneous projection of galaxy angular position , color and magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the color of the red sequence itself provides a precise estimate of the redshift of the detected cluster ( gladders & yee 2000 ) .",
    "the cluster red - sequence ( crs ) technique is extremely insensitive to projection effects , because random projections do not exhibit the necessary red sequence signature in the color - magnitude plane .",
    "cluster surveys employing the crs algorithm have traditionally been carried out using an @xmath4 combination ( gladders & yee 2005 ) .    applying the crs technique to higher",
    "redshift is an obvious next step . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the z@xmath6 filter is no longer redward of the rest - frame @xmath3 break .",
    "therefore , to detect early - types at higher redshift , a redder filter must be employed . covering large areas of sky in the nir from the ground",
    "is a daunting proposition because of the bright nir sky background and current dearth of large format nir cameras .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope offers a promising alternative .",
    "here we present results from the first look survey ( fls ) utilizing an @xmath0 $ ] filter combination .",
    "as an illustration of the overall depth of the fls , and the expected colors of early - type galaxies , figure  [ fig : cmr ] shows the @xmath0 $ ] color - magnitude diagram for all galaxies in the 4 degree@xmath7 main field . the irac component of the fls totals 60s of coverage , reaching a survey depth of about @xmath8=18.5 $ ] on the vega magnitude scale .",
    "the r - band component was obtained at the kitt peak 4 m mayall telescope ( fadda et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the solid lines show the expected colors of early - types from models generated using the code of bruzual and charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "the slight slope is a reflection of the well - known color - mass - metallicity effect ; fainter , less massive galaxies appear bluer in color .",
    "figure  [ fig : photoz ] shows the photometric redshift ( inferred from the @xmath0 $ ] color ) versus the spectroscopic redshift , for each of 26 clusters for which a spectroscopic redshift of a red - sequence galaxy was available .",
    "the key shows the source of each of the spectra .",
    "the large symbols indicate clusters for which more than one spectroscopic redshift was measured .",
    "the photometeric and spectroscopic redshifts are in excellent agreement , with an r.m.s .",
    "dispersion of @xmath9 .",
    "this is an accuracy comparable to the best four ( or more ) passband photometric studies .",
    "the advantage here is , of course , that one is determining a photometric redshift for each cluster by calculating a mean color , averaging over many early - type galaxies with intrinsically similar color at the same redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig : flscluster55 ] shows an example of a cluster detected at @xmath10 . clockwise from upper left the four panels show the @xmath11 image , the @xmath8 $ ] image , the @xmath0 $ ] color - magnitude diagram , and the mips @xmath12 $ ] image .    for comparision",
