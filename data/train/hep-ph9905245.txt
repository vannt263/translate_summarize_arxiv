    "one of the important objectives of all the future collider experiments at rhic and lhc is to detect the new state of matter called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) which is expected to be produced during the ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions . such an exotic state , if formed , will cool during expansion till it reaches a critical temperature @xmath0 where the qgp will be transformed to the hadron phase via a first or second - order phase transition .",
    "the hadrons will then cool down further to the freeze - out temperature @xmath1 where they cease to interact with each other and fly away to the detectors . during the process of the thermal expansion ,",
    "photons and dileptons are produced directly from the plasma as well as from the hadron phases .",
    "these thermal photons and dileptons are considered to be ideal probes for the detection and study of subsequent evolution of the qgp @xcite as they leave the plasma without any interaction .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    in the standard scenario @xcite , the quark gluon plasma formed during the collision is expected to thermalize in a typical time scale of 1 fm / c . however , some recent works @xcite suggest that due to high initial parton density ( mostly gluonic ) at rhic and lhc energies , the plasma may attain kinetic equilibrium in a very short time ( @xmath2 ) but it may be far from chemical equilibrium . since the initial parton plasma is mostly gluonic , many more quarks and anti - quarks are needed in order to achieve chemical equilibrium .",
    "earlier studies @xcite have shown that a chemically non - equilibrated plasma cools faster as compared to equilibrated plasma , which follows bjorken s scaling law ( @xmath3=const ) . in the case of non - equilibrated plasma , additional energy is consumed in producing more quarks and anti - quarks in approaching chemical equilibrium due to which the cooling is accelerated as compared to the bjorken s scaling law .",
    "since the plasma cools faster , it may not attain chemical equilibrium before the temperature reaches the critical value @xmath0 .",
    "even if one includes transverse expansion , the large velocity gradient may drive the system further away from the chemical equilibrium as shown by @xcite .    the effect of chemical equilibration on thermal photon and dilepton emission has been studied by several authors @xcite . in these studies",
    ", it was assumed that the nucleus- nucleus collision is fully transparent , leading to the formation of a baryon - free plasma .",
    "however , some of the recent works have suggested that even at rhic energies the colliding nuclei may not be fully transparent and some amount of baryon stopping may occur particularly at higher rapidities .",
    "for @xmath4 collisions at 200 a gev , the baryo - chemical potential @xmath5 may be of the order of t for @xmath6 @xcite , which is the region of interest of the phenix detector for di - muon measurements @xcite .",
    "the presence of finite baryon density may affect the process of chemical equilibration and the rate of cooling .",
    "this will , in turn , affect the thermal dilepton yields , which are the potential probes for the detection of the expanding quark gluon plasma .",
    "the present work is aimed at studying these effects , by considering the dynamical evolution of a baryon rich plasma undergoing chemical equilibration .",
    "it is seen that the rate of cooling of the plasma slows down in the presence of @xmath5 compared to a baryon - free plasma .",
    "the calculations also show that the rate of dilepton production is suppressed at finite baryon density , but the time integrated thermal yields are rather unaffected due to slower cooling of the plasma in the presence of small amount of the baryon density .",
    "we assume a quark gluon plasma which has thermally equilibrated but is far off from chemical equilibrium .",
    "the distribution functions for quarks ( anti - quarks ) and gluons for such an unsaturated plasma can be described by juttner distributions given by f _",
    "q(_|q ) = =   ;  f _ g = where @xmath7 .",
    "the fugacity factor @xmath8 ( @xmath9 and g ) gives the measure of the deviation of the distribution functions from the equilibrium values and @xmath10 (= @xmath5/3 ) is the quark - chemical potential .",
    "the chemical equilibrium is said to be achieved when @xmath11 .",
    "it may be mentioned here that one can also define the quark and anti - quark distribution functions using a different definition for fugacities @xmath12 and @xmath13 given by _",
    "q(|q)=e^x_q(|q ) in that case , one does not use the quark chemical potential @xmath10 explicitly .",
    "however , the definition ( 1 ) is quite convenient , since at equilibrium ( @xmath14=@xmath15=1 ) , the chemical potential associated with @xmath16 vanishes but the baryo chemical potential still exists .",
    "further , we have taken @xmath17 at all values of @xmath18 so that when @xmath19 , @xmath20 resulting in a baryon symmetric matter",
    ".      in general , chemical reactions among partons can be quite complicated because of the possibility of initial and final state gluon radiations .",
    "however , we restrict our considerations to the following dominant reaction mechanisms @xcite for the equilibration of parton flavours , +  @xmath21  @xmath22 + the evolution of the parton densities are governed by the master equations _ ( n_gu^ ) = ( r_23 -r_32 ) -(r_gq - r_qg ) _ ( n_qu^ ) = _ ( n_|q u^)= ( r_gq - r_qg)where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the rates for the process @xmath25 and its reverse and @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the process @xmath28 and its reverse respectively . in case of a baryon rich plasma , the presence of quark - chemical potential @xmath10 , affects the process @xmath22 directly .",
    "we , therefore , study the @xmath10 dependence of this process more explicitly .",
    "the rate equations for this process are given by@xcite @xmath29    @xmath30    squared matrix element , summed over spin and color , @xmath31 is weighted by two gluon distribution functions @xmath32 for the initial states .",
    "the factor @xmath33[1-f_{\\bar q}]$ ] indicates pauli blocking for the final states . in the reverse process ( 6 ) , the rate is weighted by the distribution functions of quarks and anti - quarks for the initial states and the gluon final states each gain an enhancement factor @xmath34 $ ] due to bose - einstein statistics .",
    "the factor of 1/2 accounts for the identity of the two gluons .    using the identity @xmath35[1-f_{\\bar q}]=   \\frac { f_q(p_3 ) f_{\\bar q}(p_4 ) }   { \\lambda_q \\lambda_{\\bar q } }   e^{(p_3+p_4)/t}\\ ] ] and @xmath36    it may be shown that the @xmath10 dependence in the rate equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) for the process @xmath37 basically comes through the product of quark and anti - quark distribution functions @xmath38",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) show the variation of the product @xmath38 with momenta p and @xmath14 respectively for different values of @xmath39 .",
    "1(a ) shows the product @xmath38 as a function of p at a few typical values of @xmath40 for @xmath41 0.1 and for temperatures t=0.57 gev and t=0.2 gev . fig .",
    "1(b ) shows the @xmath42 as a function of @xmath14 at temperature t= 0.57 gev and p=0 .",
    "it is seen ( fig 1a ) that as the momentum increases or the temperature decreases , the @xmath43 factor in the denominator of ( 1 ) dominates and the product @xmath38 becomes less sensitive to @xmath10 . here , we have used the same values of p for both quark and anti - quark distribution functions , although their momenta @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be quite different .",
    "however , for any other combinations of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the deviation will not be more than that observed for p=0 . we have taken @xmath46 in fig .",
    "1(b ) to show the maximum amount of deviation of this product as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "it can be seen from fig 1(b ) , that the above product is not very sensitive quark chemical potential if the plasma is highly unsaturated ( @xmath14 @xmath47 0.1 ) .",
    "this feature has an important relevance for the collisions at rhic energy as the chemical equilibration is not achieved by the time @xmath48 drops to @xmath0 and the quark fugacity remains much below unity ( @xmath490.1 ) @xcite .",
    "the nearly @xmath39 independence of the above product is also evident from eq .",
    "( 1 ) . for small values of @xmath14 ,",
    "the contribution from the factor @xmath50 in the denominator is not very significant if @xmath39 is small .",
    "the @xmath39 dependence of the quark and anti - quark distribution functions mainly arises due to the @xmath51 factor in the numerator .",
    "since these exponential factors get cancelled in the product , @xmath38 will have weak @xmath39 dependence at small baryon density if the plasma is highly unsaturated .",
    "so the integrals ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) will not depend explicitly on @xmath10 except through the thermal quark mass @xmath52 which is generally used as a cut - off parameter in the evaluation of the integral to avoid the divergence .",
    "the thermal quark mass appropriate for a non - equilibrium plasma is given by @xcite m_q^2 = _ 0^dp",
    "p  [ 2  f_g+f_q+f_|q ] since the gluon distribution function has no @xmath10 dependence , the rate for the process @xmath21 will depend on @xmath10 through the debye screening mass @xmath53 which is used to avoid the divergence in both the scattering cross sections and the radiation amplitude and can be given by @xcite m_d^2 = _ 0^dp",

    "the above rate equations have been solved by using the distribution function as discussed below .      in order to evaluate energy , number densities ,",
    "thermal quark mass and debye screening mass we consider the approximations for the quark and anti - quark distribution functions given by f _",
    "q(|q ) = = _ q(|q ) e^x f^eq_q ( |q ) and gluon distribution function as f_g=_g f_g^eq where @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for subsequent reference , we will call it as modified fermi dirac type ( mfd ) approximation .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the most commonly used approximation ( extended to non - zero @xmath10 ) is given by f _",
    "q(|q ) = the above approximation becomes fermi dirac distribution in the limit @xmath58 and we will refer it as fd type approximation . it has been shown in appendix a that this fd approximation is not strictly applicable in case of an unsaturated plasma ( i.e. for @xmath59 ) , though it has been used in all the earlier works @xcite for baryon free plasma ( i.e. @xmath60 ) .",
    "the mfd approximation ( 11 ) becomes fd type when @xmath61 .",
    "we would also like to compare the mfd approximation with the boltzmann ( bm ) approximation given by f _",
    "q(_|q ) = _ q(_|q)e^-(p ) /tthe bm approximation is found to be closer to the anti - quark distribution function at finite baryon density .",
    "comparison between different approximations has been discussed in appendix a.    we have evaluated the thermal quark mass @xmath52 numerically using ( 9 ) for various approximations as well as for the juttner distribution .",
    "2 shows @xmath62 as a function of @xmath14 at two different values of @xmath39 . here",
    ", the gluon contribution to thermal mass has not been included since we are interested only in examining the difference arising from the use of different approximation for the quark distribution function .",
    "it may be seen that the fd approximation coincides with the juttner distribution only in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "however , in the region of interest i.e. @xmath64 up to 0.1 or 0.2 , the deviation is quite significant .",
    "similarly , the boltzmann approximation agrees with the juttner distribution only at very small values of @xmath14 while mfd approximation agrees with the juttner distribution up to @xmath65 even at @xmath66 .",
    "since the plasma is highly unsaturated to begin with and the quark fugacity remains much below unity , we will use the mfd approximation in the subsequent calculations .",
    "the advantage of using this approximation is that we can retain the factorisation used in @xcite for the rhs of the rate equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) with the replacement of @xmath67 with @xmath68 ( see appendix b for detail ) .",
    "the rate equations are then solved in the following way .",
    "we assume the system to undergo a purely boost invariant expansion .",
    "using the mfd approximation , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) can be written as    @xmath69    @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the density weighted cross sections for the process @xmath73 and @xmath21 respectively .",

    "however , the plasma cools less rapidly in the presence of chemical potential compared to the baryon free plasma .",

    "it is important to note that the gluon equilibration rate slows down in the presence of finite baryon density . on the other hand , the quark and anti - quark",
    "equilibration rates increase slightly in the presence of finite baryon density . as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , the chemical potential @xmath7 also decreases with @xmath18 . the overall effect , however , is that the plasma cools less rapidly in the presence of chemical potential as compared to the baryon free plasma .",
    "the different behaviour of @xmath105 and @xmath14 observed in figs 4(c ) and 4(d ) as a function of @xmath18 may be understood in the following way .",
    "the @xmath39 dependence in the chemical equilibration arises due to the factors @xmath88 , @xmath89 and baryon density @xmath117 present in the rate equations ( eq . 15 and eq .",

    "therefore , the slowing down of the gluon equilibration rate is not due to @xmath88 and @xmath89 , but due to the dynamical evolution of the plasma which is affected in the presence of baryon density ( see appendix c for detailed discussion ) .",
    "the finite baryon density makes the cooling rate slower as the plasma evolves with an additional constraint of baryon number conservation .",
    "this also effects the plasma density which is mostly gluonic .",
    "it may be mentioned here that even though @xmath88 and @xmath89 do not depend strongly on @xmath39 , the rate of chemical equilibration ultimately depends on how fast the net parton production approaches zero , i.e. how fast the rhs of eq . ( 15 ) or eq . ( 16 ) becomes zero . since initially",
    "@xmath119 and @xmath120 , a slight increase in gluon density produces more ggg as compared to @xmath121 or gg pairs ( i.e. more gain than loss in the gluon numbers as seen from eq .",
    "15 ) . as a result",
    ", the gluon equilibration rate decreases where as the quark or anti - quark equilibration rate practically remains unchanged until at a later time when it goes up slightly .",
    "the decrease in gluon equilibration rate will consume less energy and will make the plasma cool still slower . therefore , the over all slowing down of the plasma cooling rate is due to both slower gluon equilibration as well as a slower expansion rate of the plasma that results in presence of baryon density .",
    "we have also investigated the rate of cooling by increasing the baryon density further , although our approximation breaks down at high @xmath39 values .",
    "we find that the cooling rate never exceeds the bjorken s limit which is consistent with the fact that for an ideal plasma bjorken s scaling is the upper limit even in case of a baryon rich plasma .",
    "this may be verified directly from the conditions @xmath122= const and @xmath123=const ( s and @xmath124 are entropy and baryon density respectively ) without solving any rate equations . for an equilibrated plasma",
    ", @xmath39 remains independent of @xmath18 and the temperature follows the rule @xmath115 = const .",
    "it is known that the rate of parton equilibration is enhanced considerably due to various factors like higher order gluon multiplication @xcite , temperature dependent coupling constants @xcite and viscosity .",
    "all these processes need to be included for a complete understanding of the chemical equilibration during the hydrodynamical evolution of the plasma .",
    "we do not include all the above effects due to various complexities involved in the calculations .",
    "for example , the perturbative calculations may not be valid if @xmath125 is allowed to vary with @xmath18 which may have large value at the end of the evolution @xcite .",
    "similarly , to calculate the rate for @xmath126 ; @xmath127 , one needs to understand the complete space time structure of the multi gluon processes @xcite .",
    "similarly , inclusion of dissipative effects complicates the problem further .",
    "therefore , in order to isolate the effect of baryo - chemical potential on the chemical equilibration , we have considered in this work a non - viscous plasma which expands isentropically .",
    "we do not include any higher order gluon multiplication processes and also we use a constant value for @xmath125=0.3 .",
    "the results on the dilepton production yields are discussed in the following section .",
    "thermal photons and dileptons are the ideal probes to test the hydrodynamical evolution of a plasma created in heavy ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies . it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the thermal photon and dilepton rates are suppressed at finite baryon density when the rates are calculated at a fixed energy density . however , this suppression is primarily due to lower initial temperature that results at higher baryon density .",
    "we will show in the following that the presence of finite baryon density enhances the space - time integrated thermal yield of dileptons , in spite of the fact that the rate of production is suppressed @xcite .",
    "we have considered here the dilepton production , however this study can be extended to the thermal photons as well .",
    "the dileptons are produced predominantly via the reaction @xmath128 .",
    "we ignore the annihilation and the compton like reactions in the present calculations since their contributions may not be important for invariant masses above 1 gev .",

    "as shown in the figures , if the plasma is chemically non - equilibrated , the suppression of the dilepton yield at higher baryo - chemical potential is not significant even at higher invariant masses in contrast to the case for a chemically equilibrated plasma .",
    "in the present work , we have studied the effect of finite baryon density on the chemical equilibration of a longitudinally expanding quark gluon plasma .",
    "it is found that the rate of chemical equilibration for gluon slows down in the presence of finite baryon density in comparison to a baryon - free plasma , irrespective of various assumptions about the equilibration mechanism .",
    "this results in a slower cooling of the plasma , which has an important consequence resulting in higher dilepton yields even though the rate of production may be suppressed at finite baryon density due to lower initial temperature .",
    "we have studied the thermal dilepton yields from the chemically non - equilibrated expanding plasma with finite baryon density . for calculating the dilepton yields , we have considered only an ideal non - viscous fluid that undergoes isentropic expansion and we have neglected higher order gluon processes as well as temperature dependence of the coupling constant .",
    "it is found that the space - time integrated yields of dileptons are enhanced if the initial temperature is held fixed .",

    "however , the anti - quark distribution function ( a.3 and a.4 ) becomes closer to bm approximation as @xmath39 increases . at any momentum , for an unsaturated plasma at finite baryon density",
    ", the quark distribution function can be best described by the mfd approximation whereas the bm approximation is more suitable for the anti - quark distribution function .",
    "however , we do not want to use the mfd for @xmath151 and bm for @xmath152 as they will result in baryon asymmetry when @xmath153 .",
    "moreover , at finite baryon density , it is the @xmath151 distribution which dominates as the anti - quarks are strongly suppressed ( a.4 ) .",
    "therefore , we use the mfd approximation both for @xmath151 and @xmath152 in order to evaluate @xmath52 , @xmath53 and quark and anti - quark energy and number densities .",
    "we have also solved the rate equations using bm approximation both for quark and anti - quark distributions , but the final results do not change much .",
    "this is primarily due to the fact that the @xmath39 dependence comes through the exponential @xmath51 in the numerator of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and it does not matter if one uses bm or mfd approximations . however , we have used the mfd approximation for the calculations so that the same parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite can be employed by solving the rate equations .",
    "for a baryon free plasma ( @xmath60 ) , biro et .",
    "al . have used a simple factorisation for the rate equations .",
    "we can retain the same factorisation for both the processes @xmath154 and @xmath155 ( eq.(3 ) and ( 4 ) ) under the mfd approximations . using the identity ( 7,8 ) and the mfd approximations ( 11,12 ) for quark , anti - quark and gluons , the gain and loss terms for the process @xmath155 ( eq . ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ) can be combined to give @xmath156 where @xmath157 for mass less quarks or gluons . from the above expression , it is clear that the right hand side vanishes when @xmath105= @xmath14= @xmath15=1 .",
    "since the plasma is highly unsaturated , it may be reasonable to replace @xmath158 with the boltzmann distribution .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( b.1 ) can be written as @xmath159 f_g(p_1 ) f_g(p_2)\\ ] ] which represents the free space cross section for the process @xmath160 folded with the distributions for the initial particles .",
    "the cross section @xmath161 is given by _ gg q|q= ( 2)^4 ^4(p_1+p_2-p_3-p_4 ) |m|^2 it can be mentioned here that the above integral ( b.2 ) is identical to the one which could have been obtained with the classical approximations , i.e. using the boltzmann distribution function for quark , anti - quark and gluon and eliminating the pauli blocking and bose enhancement factors in the final states in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . although , we use the quantum statistics , the same expression is obtained as the classical one due to the identity and the approximations eqs .",
    "( 7,8,11,12 ) .",
    "however boltzmann approximation is used finally for @xmath158 .",
    "following @xcite , eq .",
    "( b.2 ) can be factorised as r_g g - r_q g=_2  n_g^2(1- ) similarly for the rate @xmath25 , one can use @xmath162 where @xmath163",
    "the quark gluon plasma in ( 1 + 1 ) dimenison expands following the scaling law @xmath164 . if , chemical equilibration is not complete , the plasma cools faster than @xmath165 as additional energy is spent in chemical equilibration .",
    "therefore , in case of a chemically equilibrating plasma , the cooling rate depends on the rate of equilibration of quarks and gluons present in the plasma .",
    "further , as shown in the text , the presence of baryo - chemical potential makes the gluon equilbration slow and also the temperature of the plasma falls slowly in comparison to the baryon free case .",
    "however , as will be shown here , the slow cooling of the plasma is not entirely due to the decrease of the gluon equilibration rate , but also due to the presence of baryo - chemical potential which effects the hydrodynamical expansion of the plasma .",
    "this has been demonstrated in fig .",
    "c where the temperature t , the gluon ( @xmath105 ) and quark ( @xmath14 ) fugacities have been plotted as a function of @xmath18 both for baryon free and baryon rich cases ( @xmath39=0 and 2.0 , see the solid and dashed curves ) .",
    "as discussed in the text , the gluon equilibration rate slows down and the plasma cools slowly when the baryon density is finite where as the quark equilibration rate is not effected much .",
    "next , we consider only a baryon free plasma , but we try to reduce the gluon and the quark equilibration rate by reducing the rate @xmath89 and @xmath88 by a factor f=0.6 so that the plasma now cools with the same rate ( see the dotted line ) as that of baryon rich case with @xmath39=2.0 ( dashed curve obtained using the normal value of @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) .",
    "however , the equilibration rates for gluon and quarks now become much slower ( dotted lines ) as compared to the dashed curves .",
    "this indicates that if the plasma needs to cool with a rate as that of dashed curve just due to chemical equilibration alone , the gluon and quarks need to equilibrate with a rate much slower than what is shown in fig .",
    "c corresponding to the case of a baryon rich plasma . in other words , a higher equilibration rate of gluon and quark as that of dashed curves will consume more energy and the plasma will cool faster than what is shown by dashed curve ( but still slower than the solid line ) had the chemical equilibration been the only reason for the deviation of the cooling of the plasma from the bjorken s scaling .",
    "therefore , in presence of baryon density , the slow cooling rate of the plasma arises due to two factors ; one being the slow gluon equilibration rate which consumes less energy .",
    "the other one is due to the slow hydro - dynamical expansion as the plama now needs to expand conserving the baryon number as well .",
