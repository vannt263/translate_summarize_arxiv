    "+ _ ( c ) polar - ferromagnetic solitons collision _ in a collision , ferromagnetic solitons experience only phase shifts ; polarizations remain unchanged .",
    "this is a consequence of the inability of a polar soliton to influence the polarizations of other solitons when they interact . in the case of a polar soliton ,",
    "a combination of phase shifts and polarization rotation can change @xmath71 this means that a polar soliton can be transformed into a _ split soliton _ in the collision .",
    "however , @xmath33 can never reach @xmath72 because the total spin must be conserved and there is no spin transfer in the collision .",
    "a polar soliton will not change into a split soliton if the polarizations of ferromagnetic and polar solitons are orthogonal : @xmath73      previously we have seen that two classes of one - soliton solutions can be generalized to ( almost ) arbitrary @xmath20 . however , in order to call these solutions real solitons one has to examine their mutual interactions .",
    "we have conducted a series of numerical experiments on collisions of generalized solitons for various values of @xmath36 we discovered that non - dissipating , localized entities emerge in the wake of the collision . although those entities resemble solitons , there is a major difference : they are no longer stationary - populations of magnetic components are oscillating with a well defined frequency .",

    "the creation of oscillatons is indeed generic , however , depending on the details of the collisions ( such as the sign of @xmath20 and classes of solitons participating in it ) this process can be accompanied by some side effects ( for example : a short period of intense radiation , a small momentum transfer ) .",
    "we consider a head - on collision of two generalized solitons for some @xmath36 at @xmath75 , when solitons are far apart , the wave function is , within a good approximation , a sum of two one - soliton wave functions @xmath76 .",

    "however , galilean and gauge - rotation invariance of the equation reduces the number of parameters significantly .",
    "firstly , the galilean invariance allows us to fix one of the solitons in place ( we will call it _ the target _ ) and set the other one in motion ( we will call it _ the bullet _ ) .",
    "equivalently , the collision can be viewed in the reference frame moving with the target soliton .",
    "secondly , gauge - rotation invariance allows us to fix the target s polarization to `` standard '' orientation ( @xmath83 for the ferromagnetic and @xmath84 for the polar target ) and the gauge phase of the target can be set to zero .",
    "in this work we restricted considerations to equal norms .",

    "spin densities of both oscillatons are constant and the total spin ( @xmath96 ) is conserved . in the case of polar - polar collision , both participants start with no spin . during the collision ,",
    "both target and bullet acquire spins , but the spin vectors are anti parallel , so that the total spin is still @xmath65     for the collision showed in fig .",
    "( [ fig : spacetimecollision ] ) . ]",
    "we found that the oscillation frequency is determined by the spin transferred in the collision .",
    "it depends only on the magnitude of the spin vector , not its direction : the greater the spin transfer , the greater the oscillation frequency .",
    "the amount of spin transferred in the collision depends on all collision parameters : the momentum @xmath81 , euler angles , norm and @xmath36    dependance on momentum is mostly due to the time of interaction ; fast collision means less time for atoms to transfer and weaker effects of interactions .",
    "we found that the frequency of oscillations depends on the momentum as @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are constants , fitted for a particular collision type .",
    "notice that @xmath94 has a maximum for some @xmath100 the collisions are elastic ( oscillatons are not created ) when spinors of participating solitons ( @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalizedpolarsoliton ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalizeferrosoliton ] ) ) are parallel or perpendicular . in the case of parallel spinors ,",
    "the equations effectively reduce to the scalar gross - pitaevskii equation , which is integrable , hence , the collision is elastic .",
    "another noteworthy feature of the dynamics of the collisions is the very small momentum transfer .",
    "notice that despite a very long time of observation , the oscillaton practically has not moved from its original position ( aside from a small `` recoil '' , characteristic of polar - ferro soliton collision  @xcite .",
    "this means that the only effective way to transfer energy between solitons / oscillatons is a transfer and redistribution of atoms between magnetic components .",
    "the collisions between generalized solitons are inelastic .",
    "as soon as oscillatons split up , we observe a short period of intense radiation .",
    "the actual intensity of this radiation strongly depends on the collision setup and value of @xmath36 figure ( [ fig : radiation ] ) shows norms of oscillaton as a function of time .     of the oscillatons created in collision of polar and ferromagnetic soliton as a function of time and",
    "@xmath36 collision setups are as in fig .",

    "atoms are lost due to radiation . ]",
    "note the exponential - like norm decay to some fixed value , this atom loss is due to radiation . in the collision solitons and/or oscillatons exchange atoms .",
    "this leads to the spin and energy transfer .",
    "it seems that , in the collision , solitons can acquire an extra amount of atoms and end up in a non stable state . by releasing these excess particles , in the form of radiation",
    ", the oscillaton may transfer into its equilibrium state .",
    "the frequency of oscillations is insensitive to radiation .",
    "in a collision of solitons , spin is transferred such that the spin vector of the outgoing oscillaton has a non - zero component in the @xmath101 plane .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations can be affected by rotating the frame of reference , the frequency of oscillations however does not change . particularly , in a reference frames where the projection of the spin vector on the z - axis was greater , the amplitude of oscillations dropped . in a special frame ,",
    "in which spin vector is parallel to @xmath102-axis , the amplitude is @xmath65 on top of that , an oscillaton has a very simple form when viewed in this `` good '' reference frame : a @xmath103 component vanishes , @xmath104 have constant modulai with time dependence in the form of a linear phases increase . in summary , an oscillaton wave function can be modeled by the following anzats @xmath105,\\ ] ] where @xmath106 are real , symmetric functions , @xmath107 are positive , real numbers and @xmath108 is a spin rotation operator parameterized by the euler angles @xmath109 this anzats describes oscillations of component populations , as can be seen by examining the modulai of components @xmath110\\right),\\\\     -{\\frac{1}{2}}\\eta_+\\eta_-\\sin^2\\alpha\\cos\\left[\\omega\\,t-2\\theta\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 the local spin density in this state is @xmath112 we find that the @xmath113 angle plays a role only in determining the orientation of the spin vector .",

    "this implies @xmath121 and the spinor part of the wavefunction is proportional to @xmath122 .",

    "we collide an oscillaton with small spin ( i ) with one of much larger spin ( ii ) . from the point of view of the oscillaton with greater spin ,",
    "the collision was almost elastic ; the relative change of chemical potentials @xmath107 and spins are very small .",
    "this behavior is somewhat similar to the elastic collision of two ferromagnetic solitons in the case of a completely integrable system ( @xmath22 ) , when the solitons , due to interaction , only rotate each other s spins . on the other hand , the oscillaton with smaller spin experiences not only a rotation of its spin vector , but also a substantial increase of its magnitude .",
    "next we consider the collision of post - polar and post - ferromagnetic oscillatons for ( c ) @xmath204 and ( d ) @xmath205 .",
    "the results are analogous .",
    "post ferromagnetic oscillatons ( labeled as ii ) , with greater spin , collide almost elastically : chemical potentials and spins have hardly changed .",
    "the post - polar oscillatons ( i ) , with smaller spin , similarly to the previous case , experiences not only reorientation of the spin vector , but also an increase of magnitude .",
