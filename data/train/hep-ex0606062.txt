    "the possible existence of baryon states beyond the usual @xmath20 configuration is of fundamental importance for the understanding of hadronic structure .",
    "qcd does not prohibit the existence of exotic states with different configurations such as @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , measurements of nucleon structure functions from high energy lepton - nucleon experiments have shown for example that `` sea '' quarks ( @xmath22 pairs ) contribute significantly to the total momentum of the nucleon .",
    "indeed usual baryons are admixtures of the standard @xmath20 configuration and of @xmath21 , @xmath23 , etc .    in the past , experimental searches focused on pentaquarks , _",
    "i.e. _ baryons with a minimal @xmath24 structure . in 1997 ,",
    "diakonov and collaborators  @xcite made definite predictions about the masses and widths of a decuplet of pentaquark states ( the so - called `` antidecuplet '' ) in the framework of a chiral soliton model .",
    "the most intriguing aspect of such a multiplet is the presence of three states with exotic quantum numbers or a combination of quantum numbers not allowed for ordinary baryons : the @xmath15 with @xmath25=+1 , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "in particular the positive strangeness @xmath15 is not compatible with a @xmath20 state , requiring a minimal quark configuration of the type @xmath29 .",
    "the widths of the exotic pentaquarks were predicted by this model to be very narrow ( 1015 mev ) implying that if such states exist they should be directly visible in invariant mass spectra without the need for a more sophisticated partial wave analysis .",
    "the first evidence of a @xmath15 candidate was reported in october 2002 by the leps collaboration , based on the re - analysis of existing data  @xcite .",
    "several other experimental groups followed  @xcite reporting evidence of a peak in the mass range 15211555 mev .",
    "the observation of an isospin partner of the @xmath15 ( the @xmath30 ) was recently reported by the star collaboration  @xcite while the observation of a second pentaquark state , the @xmath26 with @xmath31 structure , was reported by the na49 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the first evidence for an anti - charmed pentaquark , @xmath32 , was reported by the h1 collaboration @xcite . while pentaquark signals observed in each experiment suffered from low statistics , the observations in many different reactions using different probes ( photons , electrons , protons , neutrinos ) and targets ( protons , neutrons , nuclei ) supported the pentaquark s existence . on the contrary , subsequent re - analysis of data collected in a different set of experiments @xcite found no evidence of pentaquarks casting doubts about their existence .",
    "the experimental evidences , both positive and negative , were obtained from data previously collected for other purposes in many reaction channels and in diverse kinematic conditions , thus may involve different production mechanisms . as a result ,",
    "direct comparisons of the different experiments are very difficult , preventing a definitive conclusion about the pentaquark s existence .",
    "a second generation of dedicated experiments  @xcite , optimized for the pentaquark search , was undertaken at the department of energy s thomas jefferson national accelerator facility .",
    "these experiments covered the few gev region in photon energy , where most of the positive evidence was reported , and collected at least an order of magnitude more data than used in the previous measurements .",
    "the exclusive reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 were studied with the clas detector  @xcite with 1.6 to 3.8 gev energy photons , to look for evidence of the reaction @xmath33 , where the @xmath15 decays into @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "the main results for the @xmath0 channel were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss in detail the analysis procedure and the results for both decay modes , combining them to give a final consistent result .    for the @xmath36 decay mode , the measurement of all participating particles allows one to tag the strangeness of the reaction which clearly identifies the exotic nature of the baryon produced in association with the @xmath37 . for the other possible decay mode , @xmath38 ,",
    "since a @xmath39 was measured , the strangeness of the @xmath40 invariant mass system is not defined .",
    "nevertheless , we were motivated to analyze this channel since the majority of the positive results  @xcite were reported looking at this decay mode .",
    "moreover the clas acceptance for the two reactions is somewhat complementary and the combination of the two channels results in complete kinematic coverage .",
    "according to many theoretical predictions , e.g.  @xcite , the photon energy range covered by this experiment should be the best to explore since the @xmath15 is expected to have its maximum cross section near the production threshold .",
    "also , in this kinematic region , the clas detector provides a mass resolution of few mev and an accuracy in the mass determination of 12 mev , which is necessary to pin down the mass and width of any narrow peak in the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0 channel was previously investigated at elsa by the saphir collaboration  @xcite in a similar photon energy range , finding positive evidence for a narrow @xmath15 state with @xmath41 mev and fwhm @xmath42 less than 25 mev .",
    "the most recent analysis resulted in a total production cross section of the order of 50 nb .",
    "since this experiment completely overlaps the kinematic regions of the saphir experiment , the new results put those previous findings to a direct test for the first time . results on pentaquark searches in the exclusive reaction @xmath1 have never been published before .    in the following ,",
    "some details are given on the experiment ( sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] ) and its analysis ( sec .  [ sec : anal ] ) .",
    "the findings of @xmath0 channel are compared with the saphir experiment in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] and the systematic checks are discussed in sec .  [ sec : syst ] .",
    "the final results are reported in the last section .",
    "the measurement was performed using the clas detector in hall b at jefferson lab with a bremsstrahlung photon beam produced by a continuous 60 na electron beam of @xmath43 = 4.02 gev impinging on a gold foil of thickness @xmath44 radiation lengths .",
    "a bremsstrahlung tagging system  @xcite with a photon energy resolution of 0.1@xmath45 @xmath43 was used to tag photons in the energy range from 1.58 gev ( about the @xmath2 production threshold ) to a maximum energy of 3.8 gev . a cylindrical liquid hydrogen target cell 4 cm in diameter and 40 cm long was used .",
    "outgoing hadrons were detected in the clas spectrometer .",
    "momentum information for charged particles was obtained via tracking through three regions of multi - wire drift chambers  @xcite in conjunction with a toroidal magnetic field ( @xmath46 t ) generated by six superconducting coils .",
    "the polarity of the field was set to bend the positive particles away from the beam into the acceptance of the detector .",
    "time - of - flight scintillators ( tof ) were used for charged hadron identification  @xcite .",
    "the interaction time between the incoming photon and the target was measured by the start counter ( st )  @xcite .",
    "this is made of 24 strips of 2.2 mm thick plastic scintillator surrounding the hydrogen cell with a single - ended pmt - based read - out .",
    "a time resolution of @xmath47300 ps was achieved .",
    "the clas momentum resolution , @xmath48 is from 0.5 to 1% , depending on the kinematics .",
    "clas is well suited for simultaneous multi - hadron detection as required by experiments searching for pentaquarks ( this experiment required at least 3 hadrons detected ) .",
    "the detector geometrical acceptance for each positive particle in the relevant kinematic region is about 40% .",
    "it is somewhat less for low energy negative hadrons , which can be lost at forward angles because their paths are bent toward the beam line and out of the acceptance by the toroidal field .",
    "coincidences between the photon tagger and the clas detector triggered the recording of the events .",
    "the trigger in clas required a coincidence between the tof and the st in at least two sectors , in order to select reactions with at least two charged particles in the final state .",
    "the collected data sample contains events from several reaction channels in addition to the reactions of interest .",
    "reactions such as @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 have been used for systematic studies .",
    "an integrated luminosity of 70 pb@xmath5 was accumulated in 50 days of running in 2004 .",
    "the raw data were passed through the standard clas reconstruction software to determine the 4-momenta of detected particles . in this phase of the analysis",
    ", corrections were applied to account for the energy loss of charged particles in the target and surrounding materials , misalignments of the drift chambers position , and uncertainties in the value of the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the energy calibration of the hall - b tagger system was performed both by a direct measurement of the @xmath53 pairs produced by the incoming photons  @xcite and by applying an over - constrained kinematic fit to the reaction @xmath49 , where all particles in the final state were detected in clas  @xcite .",
    "the quality of the calibrations was checked by looking at the mass of known particles as well as their dependence on other kinematic variables ( photon energy , detected particle momenta and angles ) . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : k_spec ] shows the @xmath6 missing mass spectrum of the reaction @xmath54 : peaks of known hyperons such as the @xmath10 , the @xmath55 , and related excited states are clearly visible .",
    "the data set was independently analyzed by three groups that made use of different analysis tools and procedures .",
    "this strategy was adopted both to have a corroboration of the analysis results and an estimate of the systematic errors associated with the choice of the analysis procedure .",
    "all three analyses agreed on the main conclusions . in the following sections we report in detail the analysis procedure of one group while the comparison of the results from the different groups is discussed in section  [ sec : ind ] .",

    "the photon energy was limited to be below 2.6 gev and a possible forward peaked production of the @xmath15 was selected by applying the angular cut @xmath135 .",

    "[ fig : fig110 ] where the missing mass of the @xmath6 is shown before and after the angular cut : the @xmath11 is clearly suppressed . as a result , no hyperon rejection cuts were applied .    the @xmath37 missing mass spectrum , after all cuts , is shown in fig .",

    "all the yields reported above are notcorrected for detector acceptances .",
    "no results were published on the search of the @xmath15 in the exclusive reaction @xmath139 and therefore no comparison is possible for this channel .",
    "in the evaluation of the upper limit we have considered the following sources of systematic errors : determination of the mass resolution for the @xmath15 resonance , determination of the signal and background yields from the mass spectra , evaluation of the clas efficiency , detector inefficiencies , photon flux normalization , and dependence on the analysis procedure .",
    "the first three sources were already included in the quoted upper limit as explained in the following subsections . in particular ,",
    "the model dependence in evaluating the clas efficiency was estimated by comparing the results obtained using different models for the production cross section .",
    "the resulting efficiencies differ by a maximum of a factor two .",
    "the upper limits were estimated using always the worse case scenario .",
    "the remaining sources of systematic uncertainty , summarized in table  [ table : sys ] , result in an overall systematic error of @xmath140 accounted for by multiplying the upper limit by ( 1+@xmath116 ) .",

    "the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 were studied in search of evidence of the @xmath15 pentaquark in the @xmath16 and @xmath147 decay channels .",
    "the final states were isolated by detecting the @xmath6 or proton , the @xmath39 via its decay to @xmath57 and identifying the neutron or the second neutral kaon with the missing mass technique .",
    "for the former decay mode , the direct measurement of the @xmath6 allows the definition of the strangeness of any resonance observed in this final state .",
    "a total of 160,000 and 550,000 events were selected for the reaction @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , after the exclusion of background reactions .",
    "the @xmath15 was searched for as a narrow resonance in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 mass spectra with a width of 34 mev corresponding to the clas resolution for these channels in the kinematic region of this experiment .",
    "both mass spectra were found to be smooth and structureless .",
    "no evidence for a narrow resonance was found in the mass range 15201600 mev . combining the results of the two decay modes , we set an upper limit of 0.7 nb ( 95% confidence level ) on the total production cross section for the reaction @xmath71 .",
    "this contradicts the results previously reported for a resonance in the reaction channel @xmath0 .",
    "the accuracy in the mass determination was found to be 12 mev from the comparison of the measured masses of known particles with world data .",
    "the quality of the data and the analysis procedures were tested by deriving the differential and the total cross section for some known reactions and obtaining an agreement within the experimental errors with existing measurements .",
    "the same conclusions were found by several independent analyses , giving confidence in our final results .    due to the loose hardware trigger of the experiment , the same data set was analyzed to study the reactions @xmath148 and @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "these findings , together with the results coming from other pentaquark search experiments at jefferson lab , could clear up the debate about the existence of the pentaquark .",
