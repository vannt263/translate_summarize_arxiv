    "particle transport in spatially periodic , noisy systems has attracted considerable attention over the last decades , see e.g. ( * ? ? ? * ch .",
    "11 ) , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "there are various physical systems where brownian motion in periodic potentials plays a prominent role , such as josephson junctions @xcite , surface diffusion @xcite and superionic conductors @xcite .",
    "while the system of a brownian particle in a periodic potential is kept away from equilibrium by an external , deterministic or random , force , detailed balance does not hold . consequently , and in the absence of any spatial symmetry , a net particle current will appear , without any violation of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "it was this fundamental observation @xcite that led to a revival of interest in the problem of particle transport in periodic potentials with broken spatial symmetry .",
    "these types of non equilibrium systems , which are often called brownian motors or ratchets , have found new and exciting applications e.g as the basis of theoretical models for various intracellular transport processes such as molecular motors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , various experimental methods for particle separation have been suggested which are based on the theory of brownian motors @xcite .",
    "the long time behavior of a brownian particle in a periodic potential is determined uniquely by the _ effective drift _ and the _ effective diffusion tensor _ which are defined , respectively , as @xmath0 and @xmath1 here @xmath2 denotes the particle position , @xmath3 denotes ensemble average and @xmath4 stands for the tensor product .",
    "indeed , an argument based on the central limit theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) , @xcite implies that at long times the particle performs an effective brownian motion which is a gaussian process , and hence the first two moments are sufficient to determine the process uniquely .",
    "the main goal of all theoretical investigations of noisy , non  equilibrium particle transport is the calculation of and .",
    "one wishes , in particular , to analyze the dependence of these two quantities on the various parameters of the problem , such as the friction coefficient , the temperature and the particle mass .",
    "enormous theoretical effort has been put into the study of brownian ratchets and , more generally , of brownian particles in spatially periodic potentials @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of all these theoretical investigations is concerned with the calculation of the effective drift for one dimensional models .",
    "this is not surprising , since the theoretical tools that are currently available are not sufficient for the analytical treatment of the multi  dimensional problem .",
    "this is only possible when the potential and/or noise are such that the problem can be reduced to a one dimensional one @xcite . for more general multi ",
    "dimensional problems one has to resort to numerical simulations .",
    "there are various applications , however , where the one dimensional analysis is inadequate .",
    "as an example we mention the technique for separation of macromolecules in microfabricated sieves that was proposed in @xcite . in the two  dimensional setting considered in this paper ,",
    "an appropriately chosen driving force in the @xmath5 direction produces a constant drift in the @xmath6 direction , but with a zero net velocity in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "on the other hand , a force in the @xmath6 direction produces no drift in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the theoretical analysis of this problem requires new technical tools .",
    "furthermore , the number of theoretical studies related to the calculation of the effective diffusion tensor has also been scarce @xcite . in these papers , relatively simple potentials and/or forcing terms are considered , such as tilting periodic potentials or simple periodic in time forcing .",
    "it is widely recognized that the calculation of the effective diffusion coefficient is technically more demanding than that of the effective drift .",
    "indeed , as we will show in this paper , it requires the solution of a poisson equation , in addition to the solution of the stationary fokker ",
    "planck equation which is sufficient for the calculation of the effective drift .",
    "diffusive , rather than directed , transport can be potentially extremely important in the design of experimental setups for particle selection ( * ? ? ? *",
    "sec 5.11 ) @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop systematic tools for the calculation of the effective diffusion coefficient ( or tensor , in the multi  dimensional setting ) .    from a mathematical point of view ,",
    "non  equilibrium systems which are subject to unbiased noise can be modelled as non ",
    "reversible markov processes @xcite and can be expressed in terms of solutions to stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) . the sdes",
    "which govern the motion of a brownian particle in a periodic potential possess inherent length and time scales : those related to the spatial period of the potential and the temporal period ( or correlation time ) of the external driving force . from this point of view",
    "the calculation of the effective drift and the effective diffusion coefficient amounts to studying the behavior of solutions to the underlying sdes at length and time scales which are much longer than the characteristic scales of the system . a systematic methodology for studying problems of this type , which is based on scale separation ,",
    "has been developed many years ago @xcite .",
    "the techniques developed in the aforementioned references are appropriate for the asymptotic analysis of stochastic systems ( and markov processes in particular ) which are spatially and/or temporally periodic .",
    "the purpose of this work is to apply these multiscale techniques to the study brownian motors in arbitrary dimensions , with particular emphasis to the calculation of the effective diffusion tensor .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the model that we will study . in section [ sec : mult_an ] we obtain formulae for the effective drift and the effective diffusion tensor in the case where all external forces are markov processes . in section [ sec : ou ] we study the effective diffusion coefficient for a brownian particle in a periodic potential driven simultaneously by additive gaussian white and colored noise . section [ sec : concl ] is reserved for conclusions . in appendix",
    "a we derive formulae for the effective drift and the effective diffusion coefficient for the case where the brownian particle is driven away from equilibrium by periodic in time external fluctuations .",
    "finally , in appendix b we use the method developed in this paper to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient of an overdamped particle in a one dimensional tilted periodic potential .",
    "we consider the overdamped @xmath7dimensional stochastic dynamics for a state variable @xmath8 @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the friction coefficient , @xmath11 the boltzmann constant and @xmath12 denotes the temperature .",
    "@xmath13 stands for the standard @xmath7dimensional white noise process , i.e. @xmath14 we take @xmath15 and @xmath16 to be markov processes with respective state spaces @xmath17 and generators @xmath18 .",
    "the potential @xmath19 is periodic in @xmath6 for every @xmath20 , with period @xmath21 in all spatial directions : @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the standard basis of @xmath24 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath25^d$ ] .",
    "the processes @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be continuous in time diffusion processes which are constructed as solutions of stochastic differential equations , dichotomous noise ( * ? ? ?",
    "9 ) , more general markov chains etc .",
    "the ( easier ) case where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are deterministic , periodic functions of time is treated in the appendix .    for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that the temperature in is constant .",
    "however , this assumption is with no loss of generality , since eqn . with a time dependent temperature can be mapped to an equation with constant temperature and an appropriate effective potential @xcite .",
    "thus , the above framework is general enough to encompass most of the models that have been studied in the literature , such as pulsating , tilting , or temperature ratchets .",
    "we remark that the state variable @xmath2 does not necessarily denote the position of a brownian particle .",
    "we will , however , refer to @xmath2 as the particle position in the sequel .",
    "the process @xmath26 in the extended phase space @xmath27 is markovian with generator @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 to this process we can associate the initial value problem for the backward kolmogorov equation ( * ? ? ?",
    "8) @xmath31 which is , of course , the adjoint to the fokker ",
    "planck equation .",
    "our derivation of formulae for the effective drift and the effective diffusion tensor is based on singular perturbation analysis of the initial value problem .",
    "in this section we derive formulae for the effective drift and the effective diffusion tensor for @xmath2 , the solution of .",
    "let us outline the basic philosophy behind the derivation of formulae and .",
    "we are interested in the long time , large scale behavior of @xmath2 . for the analysis that follows it",
    "is convenient to introduce a parameter @xmath32 which in effect is the ratio between the length scale defined through the period of the potential and a large `` macroscopic '' length scale at which the motion of the particle is governed by and effective brownian motion .",
    "the limit @xmath33 corresponds to the limit of infinite scale separation .",
    "the behavior of the system in this limit can be analysed using singular perturbation theory .",
    "we remark that the calculation of the effective drift and the effective diffusion tensor are performed seperately , because a different re  scaling is needed in each case .",
    "this is due to the fact that advection and diffusion have different characteristic time scales .",
    "the backward kolmogorov equation reads @xmath34 we re  scale a space and time in according to @xmath35 and divide through by @xmath36 to obtain @xmath37 we solve pertubatively by looking for a solution in the form of a two  scale expansion @xmath38 all terms in the expansion are periodic functions of @xmath39 . from the chain rule",
    "we have @xmath40 notice that we do not take the terms in the expansion to depend explicitly on @xmath41 .",
    "this is because the coefficients of the backward kolmogorov equation do not depend explicitly on the fast time @xmath41 . in the case where the fluctuations are periodic , rather than markovian , in time",
    ", we will need to assume that the terms in the multiscale expansion for @xmath42 depend explicitly on @xmath41 .",
    "the details are presented in the appendix .",
    "we substitute now into , use and treat @xmath6 and @xmath43 as independent variables . upon equating the coefficients of equal powers in @xmath36",
    "we obtain the following sequence of equations @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 the operator @xmath47 is the generator of a markov process on @xmath48 . in order to proceed",
    "we need to assume that this process is ergodic : there exists a unique stationary solution of the fokker ",
    "planck equation @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the above @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the fokker ",
    "planck operators of @xmath20 and @xmath5 , respectively . the stationary density @xmath54 satisfies periodic boundary conditions in @xmath43 and appropriate boundary conditions in @xmath20 and @xmath5 .",
    "we emphasize that the ergodicity of the `` fast '' process is necessary for the very existence of an effective drift and an effective diffusion coefficient , and it has been tacitly assumed in all theoretical investigations concerning brownian motors @xcite .    under the assumption that has a unique solution eqn .",
    "implies , by fredholm alternative , that @xmath55 is independent of the fast scales : @xmath56 eqn . now becomes @xmath57 in order for this equation to be well posed it is necessary that the right hand side averages to @xmath58 with respect to the invariant distribution @xmath59 .",
    "this leads to the following backward liouville equation @xmath60 with the effective drift given by @xmath61      we assume for the moment that the effective drift vanishes , @xmath62 .",
    "we perform a diffusive re  scaling in @xmath63 and divide through by @xmath64 to obtain @xmath65 we go through the same analysis as in the previous subsection to obtain the following sequence of equations .",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 were defined in the previous subsection and @xmath69 equation implies that @xmath70 .",
    "now becomes @xmath71 since we have assumed that @xmath62 , the right hand side of the above equation belongs to the null space of @xmath72 and this equation is well posed .",
    "its solution is @xmath73 where the auxiliary field @xmath74 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath75 with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath43 and appropriate boundary conditions in @xmath5 and @xmath20 .",
    "we proceed now with the analysis of equation .",
    "the solvability condition for this equation reads @xmath76 from which , after some straightforward algebra , we obtain the limiting backward kolmogorov equation for @xmath77 @xmath78 the effective diffusion tensor is @xmath79 where the notation @xmath80 for the averaging with respect to the invariant density has been introduced .    the case where the effective drift does not vanish , @xmath81 , can be reduced to the situation analyzed in this subsection through a galilean transformation with respect to @xmath82 .",
    "converges to a mean zero gaussian process with effective diffusivity given by ] the effective diffusion tensor is now given by @xmath83 and the field @xmath84 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath85",
    "in this section we consider the following model @xcite    @xmath86    @xmath87    [ e : corell ]    where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are mutually independent standard @xmath7dimensional white noise processes .",
    "the potential @xmath90 is assumed to be @xmath21periodic in all spatial directions the process @xmath16 is the @xmath7dimensional onrstein  uhlenbeck ( ou ) process @xcite which is a mean zero gaussian process with correlation function @xmath91 let @xmath92 denote the restriction of @xmath2 to @xmath93^d$ ] .",
    "the generator of the markov process @xmath94 is @xmath95 with @xmath29 .",
    "standard results from the ergodic theory of markov processes see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) ensure that the process @xmath96 , with generator @xmath97 is ergodic and that the unique invariant measure has a smooth density @xmath98 with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "this is true even at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "hence , the results of section [ sec : mult_an ] apply : the effective drift and effective diffusion tensor are given by formulae and , respectively .",
    "of course , in order to calculate these quantities we need to solve equations and which take the form : @xmath99 and @xmath100 the effective diffusion tensor is positive definite . to prove this ,",
    "let @xmath101 be a unit vector in @xmath24 , define @xmath102 and let @xmath103 denote the unique solution of the scalar problem @xmath104 let now @xmath105 be a sufficiently smooth function .",
    "elementary computations yield @xmath106 we use the above calculation in the formula for the effective diffusion tensor , together with an integration by parts and the fact that @xmath107 , to obtain @xmath108 from the above formula we see that the effective diffusion tensor is non  negative definite and that it is well defined even at zero temperature : @xmath109 although we can not solve these equations in closed form , it is possible to calculate the small @xmath110 expansion of the effective drift and the effective diffusion coefficient , at least in one dimension . indeed , a tedious calculation using singular perturbation theory , e.g. @xcite yields @xmath111 and @xmath112 in writing eqn .",
    "we have used the following notation @xmath113 it is relatively straightforward to obtain the next order correction to ; the resulting formula is , however , too complicated to be of much use .",
    "the small @xmath110 asymptotics for the effective drift were also studied in @xcite for the model considered in this section and in @xcite when the external fluctuations are given by a continuous time markov chain .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , for the case of dichotomous noise , the small @xmath110 expansion for @xmath82 is valid only for sufficiently smooth potentials . indeed , the first non  zero term  of order @xmath114involves the second derivative of the potential .",
    "smooth potentials lead to an effective drift which is @xmath115 . on the contrary , eqn .",
    "does not involve any derivatives of the potential and , hence , is well defined even for non  smooth potentials . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath116 term involves third order derivatives of the potential and can be defined only when @xmath117 .",
    "we also remark that the expansion is only valid for positive temperatures .",
    "the problem becomes substantially more complicated at zero temperature because the generator of the markov process becomes a degenerate differential operator at @xmath118 .",
    "naturally , in the limit as @xmath119 the effective diffusion coefficient converges to its value for @xmath120 : @xmath121 this is the effective diffusion coefficient for a brownian particle moving in a periodic potential , in the absence of external fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it is well known , and easy to prove , that the effective diffusion coefficient given by is bounded from above by @xmath122 .",
    "this not the case for the effective diffusivity of the correlation ratchet .",
    "we compare now the small @xmath110 asymptotics for the effective diffusion coefficient with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the results presented in figures 1 and 2 were obtained from the numerical solution of equations using the euler  marayama method , for the cosine potential @xmath123 .",
    "the integration step that was used was @xmath124 and the total number of integration steps was @xmath125 .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient was calculated by ensemble averaging over @xmath126 particle trajectories which were initially uniformly distributed on @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "[ fig : efdif_tau ]    [ fig : efdif_sigma ]    in figure 1 we present the effective diffusion coefficient as a function of the correlation time @xmath110 of the ou process .",
    "we also plot the results of the small @xmath110 asymptotics .",
    "the agreement between theoretical predictions and numerical results is quite satisfactory , for @xmath128 .",
    "we also observe that the effective diffusivity is an increasing function of @xmath110 .",
    "in figure 2 we plot the effective diffusivity as a function of the noise strength @xmath129 of the ou process .",
    "as expected , the effective diffusivity is an increasing function of @xmath129 .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical predictions from and the numerical experiments is excellent .",
    "the problem of brownian motion in a periodic potential and driven by external forces was studied in this paper . using multiscale techniques we derived formulae for the effective drift and the effective diffusion tensor .",
    "we used these formulae to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient for a brownian particle in a one dimensional periodic potential which is driven by additive colored noise .",
    "the theoretical predictions are in very good agreement with the results obtained from direct numerical calculations .    in order to streamline the presentation , we studied the cases of markovian and time  periodic external fluctuations separately .",
    "it is straightforward , of course , to combine the two and obtain formulae for the effective drift and the effective diffusion coefficient when some of the processes are random and some periodic .",
    "furthermore , the case where the forcing terms depend on the particle position can be treated easily within the framework developed in this paper . in order for our method to be applicable in this case",
    "it is necessary for the fast process to be ergodic for all values of the state variable @xmath6 .",
    "we believe , thus , that our multiscale approach is general enough to encompass essentially all models for periodic potentials and external fluctuations that have been considered within the framework of brownian motors .",
    "the multiscale technique employed in this paper provides us with a systematic method for analyzing the long time behavior of solutions to the stochastic equations of motion .",
    "the assumption of scale separation upon which the method is based is always satisfied for systems with a finite number of characteristic length and time scales .",
    "naturally , the results of the multiscale analysis are valid at length and time scales large compared to the largest length and time scales of the system . for example , the time required for the correlation ratchet to reach its asymptotic brownian regime increases as the correlation time @xmath110 increases . however ,",
    "for finite @xmath110 the system will always eventually perform an effective brownian motion .    in this paper we only presented formal calculations .",
    "we emphasize however that all the results presented in this paper can be justified rigorously , and in a very general setting .",
    "the key assumptions are the ergodicity of the fast process generated by @xmath47 , defined in , and the well  posedness of the poisson equation .",
    "ergodicity implies the existence of the effective drift : this is a consequence of the strong law of large numbers .",
    "ergodicity , together with well  posedness of eqn .",
    "imply the existence of the effective diffusion coefficient : this is a consequence of the martingale central limit theorem , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "needless to say , checking the ergodicity of the fast process and the well posedness of are not trivial tasks .",
    "results of this form are proved , for example , in @xcite .    in the case of stochastic external fluctuations ,",
    "the calculation of the effective diffusion tensor requires the numerical solution of equations and .",
    "it is conceivable that this task might be as computationally demanding as direct monte carlo simulations . from this point of view",
    "the main advantage of our approach is that it provides a natural starting point for careful asymptotic analysis and rigorous study of the dependence of the effective drift and the effective diffusion coefficient on the various parameters of the problem .    on the contrary ,",
    "when the coefficients of eqn .",
    "are periodic in time , the calculation of @xmath130 requires the numerical solution of eqns . and .",
    "these are pdes with periodic coefficients and can be routinely solved with e.g. a spectral method . in this",
    "setting , our approach offers a clear computational advantage over monte carlo simulations .",
    "we also mention in passing that the various formulae for the effective diffusion coefficient that have been derived in the literature @xcite can be obtained from equation : they correspond to cases where equations and can be solved analytically .",
    "an example  the calculation of the effective diffusion coefficient of an overdamped brownian particle in a tilted periodic potential  is presented in appendix .",
    "similar calculations yield analytical expressions for all other exactly solvable models that have been considered in the literature .    in this paper",
    "we have studied the overdamped limit .",
    "there are various problems , however , where inertial effects are important and can not be neglected . as examples we mention rocking ratchets in squids , @xcite , surface diffusion @xcite , inertial particles @xcite .",
    "our framework can be generalized to include inertial effects .",
    "it is very interesting , then , to understand the dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient on the particle inertia .",
    "this problem is currently under investigation .",
