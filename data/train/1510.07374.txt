    "stable and controlled propagation of high power laser pulses in underdense plasma is a crucial part of laser - driven plasma accelerators @xcite , which are becoming important for high - temporal and spatial resolution imaging systems @xcite as well as for the ultra - high energy multistage acceleration technique @xcite .",
    "there are two parts of the laser pulse propagation which have to be controlled for laser - driven acceleration : ( i ) formation of a pulse wake with required field distribution , and ( ii ) self - injection of plasma electrons in the acceleration phase of the wakefield @xcite .",
    "usually , gaussian laser pulses are used for laser wakefield acceleration ( lwfa ) .",
    "however , some laser modes can be useful for controlled electron self - injection and ( or ) further electron acceleration . here ,",
    "radially or azimuthally polarized laser pulses are of particular interest being two tem01 or tem10 modes , nearest to the gaussian ( tem00 ) mode . because of their strong longitudinal electric field at the focus",
    ", these modes at high pulse power have been proposed for direct electron acceleration @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the radially polarized laser pulses have been proposed theoretically for an efficient electron wakefield acceleration as well .",
    "in contrast , in experiments @xcite the radially and azimuthally polarized laser pulses exhibited spectra of side scattered light very different from spectra for gaussian laser pulses : there was no typical red shift ( and/or blue shift ) in thomson scattering originating from plasma wave formation @xcite . this may be a result of some kind of instability , and makes investigation of propagation of such laser pulses in plasma in the real geometry particularly important .",
    "instabilities are an inevitable part of the laser plasma interaction process , and play an important role in governing the interaction mechanism . there have been many different kinds of instabilities reported and investigated both theoretically and experimentally : raman , brilluion , modulation , filamentation instabilities , and so on @xcite .",
    "the filamentation instability results in transverse disintegration of a laser pulse into several filaments",
    ". periodic breakup of radially symmetrical optical beams due to self - focusing in a kerr - type medium was first reported by campillo et .",
    "experimentally they demonstrated that a radially symmetric fresnel patterns break up into focal spots having azimuthal symmetry and regular spacing .",
    "yankauskas et al .",
    "@xcite , have proposed that , for a medium with kerr - type nonlinearity , an infinite number of bound states with cylindrical symmetry should exist , where , bound state implies a central bright spot surrounded by annular rings of varying dimension .",
    "stability of cylindrically symmetric higher - bound states is investigated analytically and numerically by soto - crespo et .",
    "@xcite . they found that higher - bound states are susceptible to the filamentation instability .",
    "a similar study was also carried out by skryain et .",
    "al @xcite . a common point in all these transverse beam break up studies",
    "is that they rely on the optical kerr effect .",
    "however , in the propagation of an ultra - intense laser pulses over shorter distances , @xmath4 few mm , the kerr effect is not usually significant ; the self - focusing of the laser pulses is governed by ponderomotive and ( or ) relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "the pondermotive and relativistic nonlinearities , along with the non - uniformity in the laser and plasma conditions , may result in the spatial - temporal break up of a laser beam into multiple arbitrary number of filaments .",
    "an extensive investigation of such a filamentation instability has been done both theoretically and numerically for linearly or circularly polarized laser pulses @xcite , but no such filamentation instability was explored with radially or azimuthally polarized laser pulses , where the pulse transverse mode structure is different .    in this paper",
    "we examine the symmetry breaking instability when an intense radially or azimuthally polarized laser pulse propagates in uniform underdense plasmas , using 3d particle - in - cell simulation .",
    "this instability results in transverse breakup of the pulse into multiple filaments .",
    "the unique feature of this instability is that the filaments which appear are symmetric and non - randomized in space .",
    "moreover , depending on the intensity of the laser pulse the number of filaments appear as an integral multiple of three . in the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is for the first time such a harmonic behaviour of filamentation instability is reported for radially polarized laser pulse . in simulations",
    ", it was found that this instability is triggered by the interaction of the radially or azimuthally polarized laser pulses with self - induced positive plasma density compression along the propagation axis .",
    "however , in contrast to the gaussian laser pulses , the relativistic self - focusing results in shrinking of the radially symmetrical laser pulse ring . in the reference frame moving with the laser pulse , the stability conditions resemble mathematically to the conditions for the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "the real geometry particle - in - cell simulation not only allows the conditions for instability and its increment to be studied , but the entire nonlinear process . to avoid misunderstanding in the nature of the instabilities ,",
    "we exclude the kerr non - linearity from our fully relativistic simulation .",
    "the dynamics of the interaction between the laser pulse and plasma density can be given in terms of the following equations :    @xmath5 = \\frac{-e^{2}n_{e}}{4\\gamma m\\omega_{l}^{2}}\\vec{\\nabla}_{\\perp } \\vec{a^{2 } } - en_{e}\\vec{\\nabla}_{\\perp}\\varphi\\ ] ]    @xmath6    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the mass of electron , @xmath9 is the electron density , @xmath10 is the non - perturbed ion density , @xmath11 is the vector potential and @xmath12 is the scalar potential , @xmath13 is the transverse velocity of plasma electrons , @xmath14 is the laser frequency , @xmath15 is the electron charge and @xmath16 is the relativistic factor of the plasma electrons , @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the vector potential is a solution of the well know equation @xmath20 and @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the electron current and the initial conditions are : @xmath23 .",
    "the first term in the right side of eq.(1 ) is the ponderomotive force @xcite resulting in electron evacuation whose action is compensated by the electrostatic field generated by this charge separation . in the reference frame moving with the group velocity of the laser pulse , one can consider the equilibrium conditions : @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and equations ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "instability conditions are examined with the use of the series @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "this gives us the following set of equations :    @xmath28-en_{e}^{0}\\vec{\\nabla}_{\\perp}\\varphi_{1}\\ ] ]    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    seeking a solution for @xmath35 of the following form : @xmath36}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 means harmonics amplitude for the functions , leads to equations mathematically equivalent to those for the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite even though the physical process is completely different .",
    "a solution of equations for @xmath38 can be found only numerically .",
    "equations ( 6)-(12 ) are valid for a laser pulse of any arbitrary mode . however , for the instability to appear , the transverse gradient of electron density should be alternating , i.e. , @xmath39 should change sign at least two times . physically",
    ", this means the ponderomotive force should result not only in rarefaction but also in compression of the electron density . for a rpp and uniform plasma density",
    "this condition is sustained .",
    "the relativistic self - focusing results in both : thinning of the rpp ring and shrinking of the pulse waist that provokes electron compression near the pulse axis . by analogy with the rayleigh - taylor instability , the maximum increment @xmath0 in this case can be evaluated as @xmath40 where @xmath1 is the acceleration and @xmath2 is the density gradient scale length or for the case : @xmath41 . in plasma channels",
    "@xmath39 may approach to that for a gaussian - like pulse with only a single change of its sign , eliminating the compression near the pulse axis .",
    "the instability , therefore , must vanish if the plasma channel is deep enough .",
    "we have to note that for gaussian - like pulses the filamentation instability can also occur in higher density plasma @xcite , however , in these cases the source of the instability is different .    instead of numerical analysis of approximate eq .",
    "( 6)-(12 ) , which can give only condition(s ) for the instability appearance , we perform fully relativistic particle - in - cell simulations of rpp propagation in real geometry .",
    "this allows us to study the full evolution of the pulse instability depending on laser and plasma conditions .",
    "the fully relativistic 3d particle - in - cell ( pic ) fplaser3d code @xcite employing the square weighting for currents and moving window technique is used , disregarding the kerr non - linearity . in all the simulations presented in this work",
    "the window size is @xmath42 along the propagation direction and @xmath43 along the transverse direction , unless specifically mentioned .",
    "the axial resolution is @xmath44 and transverse resolution is @xmath45 , and 8 particles per cell .",
    "the plasma length is set to 1 mm , with density gradient of length @xmath46 on either edge .",
    "calculations are performed for uniform plasma density and plasma channels .",
    "a laser pulse of wavelength 800 nm and duration of 30 fs is used for all the calculations . in order to understand the nature of the instability ,",
    "the interaction of rpp with different laser and plasma parameters is examined .",
    "the maximum laser intensity is varied from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the uniform plasma density is also varied from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , and the pulse waist is varied from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "the plasma channels have a parabolic profile in the radial direction as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the radial coordinate , @xmath55 is the channel radius , @xmath56 is the on axis plasma density and @xmath57 is the density depth . in simulations",
    "the radius of the plasma channel is @xmath58 .",
    "the depth of the plasma channel is varied from 0.5 to 0.25 with respect to the maximum electron density .",
    "the focus position of the pulse is @xmath59 inside the simulation box .",

    "1 shows the longitudinal and transverse field components of a radially polarized laser pulse . unlike the transverse field of a linearly or circularly polarized pulse",
    ", it has a double gaussian beam structure along transverse direction .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2 , this gives a doughnut shape transverse intensity profile to the radially polarized pulse in the plane perpendicular to the propagation axis .",
    "at first , to check the numerical focusability of a diffraction limited radially polarized laser pulse we launch it in vacuum .",
    "the intensity of the pulse is @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the rayleigh length of the pulse corresponding to @xmath78 is @xmath79 .",
    "2 shows the transverse intensity evolution of the pulse in vacuum .",
    "2(a ) shows transverse intensity profile of the pulse @xmath80 before the focus position , fig 2(b ) shows transverse intensity profile at the focus position , and fig .",
    "2(c ) shows after @xmath81 ( 1 ps ) beyond the focus position .",
    "one can notice that there is no change in the transverse intensity profile of the pulse except that due to natural diffraction .",
    "3 shows the transverse intensity profile of the radially polarized laser pulse with exactly the same parameters as above , but now propagating in a uniform underdense plasma of density @xmath82 .",
    "one can notice from fig .",
    "3(b ) the development of the instability after @xmath83 .",
    "the instability results in formation of the mode m = 3 .",
    "this mode occurs to satisfy two kinds of symmetry : reflection and rotational symmetry .",
    "modes m = 1 and m = 2 can not satisfy such symmetry conditions . fig .",
    "4 shows the corresponding transverse electron density profile . in fig . 5 and 6",
    "the same results are given in 3d contour plots .",
    "they confirm the separation of the rpp into three independent laser pulses .",
    "this reflects that the diffraction of the initial laser pulse prevents further development of the instability .",
    "as anticipated , an increase in intensity results in more severe instability growth .",
    "7 shows the transverse intensity profile of the radially polarized pulse of intensity @xmath84 propagating in uniform underdense plasma of density @xmath82 . in this case",
    "the instability develops faster since the acceleration increases .",
    "one can also notice from fig .",
    "7(d ) the development of the next higher mode , m=6 . moreover , the diffraction of the laser pulse is weaker in this case , allowing the development of such modes .",
    "8 shows the corresponding transverse electron density profile . fig . 9 and 10 illustrates these results in 3d contour plots .",
    "similar calculations for a rpp of intensity @xmath85 propagating in a uniform underdense plasma of density @xmath82 results in no instability in the first 1 ps , and then a weak sign of instability occurs .",
    "the growth rate of the instability decreases by decreasing the intensity of the pulse .",
    "11 illustrates a weak instability development for this case .",
    "qualitatively this confirms the dependency of the increment of the instability on acceleration as @xmath86 .",
    "an increase in plasma density reveals the importance of total self - focusing in the development of the filamentation instability .",
    "fig.12 shows the transverse intensity evolution of a rpp of intensity @xmath77 propagating in uniform underdense plasma of density @xmath87 . in this case",
    "the transverse window size of the simulation box is @xmath88 .",
    "one can notice strong self - focusing of the rpp along with the development of the instability .",
    "competition between the total pulse self - focusing and the thinning of the rpp ring is clearly observed .",
    "such a non - linear process can be examined only by self - consistent particle - in - cell simulations . in fig .",
    "13 results of calculations for an azimuthally polarized laser pulse of @xmath89 and @xmath78 propagating in a uniform underdense plasma of @xmath82 are shown .",
    "the result of instability is clearly seen : the laser pulse is split into three parts .",
    "instability increment behavior is numerically close to that for the radially polarized laser pulse .",
    "however , the resulting distribution of the intensity is not as symmetric as for the radially polarized pulse case .",
    "again , the development of the instability is ceased by the pulse diffraction for this case also .",
    "14 shows the corresponding transverse electron density distribution .    in order to check the effect of pulse spot size on instability development we reduced the spot of the laser pulse to @xmath90 .",
    "the intensity of the radially polarized laser pulse is @xmath48 and plasma density is @xmath91 .",
    "15 shows the transverse intensity evolution for this case .",
    "the instability development time is around 500 fs , which is less than in the case for @xmath78 at the same intensity .",
    "this again implies the inverse dependency of the rate of instability development on density gradient scale length .",
    "16 shows the corresponding transverse electron density evolution .",
    "these figures demonstrate a more intuitive physical behavior of transverse density modulation and instability development .    at first sight",
    "it appeared that the mode distribution is regular and is not stochastic .",
    "however , the angle at ( y , z)-axis is determined in the laboratory reference frame with a rotation phase @xmath92 : @xmath93 , @xmath94 . therefore , the spatial distribution of the modes may randomly vary shot - to - shot in a real experiment .    as we expected",
    ", the propagation of the rpp in parabolic plasma channels differs completely from that in uniform density plasma . in fig .",
    "17 and 18 transverse distribution of the pulse intensity in parabolic channels are given . in fig .",
    "17 the plasma channel is rather shallow @xmath95 , while in fig .",
    "18 it is deeper @xmath96 .",
    "channel diameters are equal in both cases .",
    "one can see that after propagation of about 1.6 ps the rpp is slightly distorted in the shallow channel ; in uniform density plasma this pulse would have been already split by this time of propagation . for the deeper channel",
    "there is essentially no distortion of the pulse transverse profile at all up to this time .",
    "this is attributed to the absence of electron density compression near the laser axis that removes the source of instability .    from the above discussion",
    "it is obvious that electron acceleration in rpp wakefield in a uniform density plasma is not practical .",
    "fig.19 shows the cross - sections of spatial distribution of electric field and electron density of rpp propagating in uniform density plasma with an intensity of @xmath89 and @xmath97 . before splitting",
    "the wakefield is quite stochastic and can not provide the acceleration of high quality electron beams .",
    "moreover , after splitting the three laser pulses are propagating independently in the forward direction with gradual divergence .",
    "such beams are hardly interesting for any practical application . in contrast , in deep plasma channel the instability vanishes and one can expect a promising scenario for the electron self - injection and their further acceleration .    in fig.20 3d plots of density evolution for high energy component of plasma electrons are presented for rpp with @xmath84 and @xmath78 propagating in a parabolic plasma channel of depth 0.25 , i.e. , @xmath98 and @xmath96 .",
    "initially there are only plasma field oscillations in the wake , however , after 1 ps of propagation one can observe electron self - injection .",
    "spatial distribution of trapped electrons is marked by a circle and also given as insets in fig .",
    "despite the absence of the instability , the structure of laser wake field does not allow high quality beam acceleration .",
    "the energy distributions for electrons accelerated by rpp with different intensity are shown in fig .",
    "21 . even for high pulse intensity in uniform plasma",
    "the energy of the accelerated electrons is small , only a few tens of mev . for the deeper channel and pulse intensity",
    "@xmath84 the maximum energy of the accelerated electrons exceeds @xmath99 in 2.2 ps .",
    "in deep plasma channel the energy distribution of the accelerated electrons display a quasi - mono - energetic feature as shown by the circle in fig .",
    "however , due to stochastic behavior of the injection process , the energy spectrum lost its monoenergetic feature for longer propagation time .",
    "nevertheless , the strong axial electric field of rpp and sufficiently high energy gain of accelerated electrons in the pre - plasma channel suggests that these pulses might be useful for multistage acceleration schemes .",
    "using three dimensional fully relativistic particle - in - cell simulations we have investigated the filamentation instability for radially and azimuthally polarized laser pulses in uniform underdense plasma .",
    "this instability is provoked by compression of plasma electrons near the laser axis during radially or azimuthally polarized pulse self - focusing . depending on laser intensity we have observed formation of three laser filaments for @xmath89 and six filaments for @xmath84 , which afterward propagate independently . for high density plasma",
    "the filaments formation is suppressed by pulse self - focusing .",
    "the source of instability has been confirmed by disappearance of instability in the parabolic plasma channels .",
    "this implies that rpp can be guided in a spatially tailored plasma , for example using splash plasma channels @xcite .",
    "laser wake field acceleration by rpp has been explored as well . in uniform density plasma",
    "the filamentation instability makes the lwfa impractical .",
    "divergence of laser filaments will result in poor emittance of the electron beams , if they occur . in plasma channels",
    "lwfa of electrons by rpp is more suitable .",
    "however , stochastic self - injection of plasma electrons results in poor quality electron beams",
    ". such acceleration by conventional gaussian pulses is much more efficient .",
