    "the purpose of this paper is to strengthen the inequalities and and provide strong @xmath0-variational estimates for the sequences @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "let us recall , that for a sequence @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the @xmath0-variation seminorm @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26    the caldern transference principle allows us to reduce the matters and work on @xmath27 rather than on an abstract measure space @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the set of integers @xmath27 with the counting measure and the bilateral shift operator will be our model dynamical system .",
    "in this context , the operators and can be treated as convolution operators with the kernels @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , where @xmath31 stands for dirac s delta at @xmath32 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following .",
    "[ thm : var ] let @xmath33 be a convolution operator given either by or by .",
    "then for @xmath3 and @xmath1 there is a constant @xmath14 such that @xmath34 for every @xmath35 .",
    "the advantage of studying @xmath0-variational seminorm is twofold . on the one hand , for each @xmath36 , @xmath0-variations control supremum norm .",
    "more precisely , for any sequence of functions @xmath37 and any @xmath38 we have the pointwise estimate @xmath39 on the other hand , @xmath0-variation seminorm is an invaluable tool in problems concerning pointwise convergence .",
    "namely , if @xmath40 then the sequence @xmath37 converges .",
    "the second property is especially important since we obtain a quantitative form of almost everywhere convergence of @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , one does not need to find a dense class of functions for which the pointwise convergence holds which sometimes might be a difficult problem .",
    "variational estimates were the subject of many papers , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "let us notice that theorem  [ thm : var ] for the truncated singular integral immediately implies that the singular integral along the primes @xmath41 is bounded on @xmath42 for any @xmath3 .",
    "this can be considered , to some extent , as an extension of a result of ionescu and wainger @xcite to the set of prime numbers .",
    "a multidimensional version of bourgain s averaging operator along polynomial mappings @xcite and truncated version of ionescu and wainger singular integral @xcite were considered by the first two authors with e.  m. stein and analogous results to theorem [ thm : var ] have been obtained .",
    "this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .    in the last section we obtain an unweighted version of theorem [ thm : var ] for averaging operators .",

    "its proof proceeds in several steps . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we collect some @xmath42 estimates for @xmath0-variations of some general multipliers . the general philosophy lying behind these proofs is the transference principle which allows us to compare @xmath42 estimates with _ a priori _ @xmath45 estimates . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we use the circle method to construct approximating multipliers which will be used to build up @xmath46 theory .",
    "the results in section [ sec:3 ] are formulated in an abstract form and are applicable to both kinds of kernels we are interested in . in section [ sec:4 ] we provide a systematic proof of theorem [ thm : var ] based on the separate analysis of short and long variations .",
    "the short variations are covered by the ideas from @xcite . in order to bound the long variations we use the results from section [ sec:2 ] and section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "the approach we exploit here strongly uses some specific features of the prime numbers and this is how we preserve the dependence of the form @xmath47 on the variational exponent @xmath0 obtained for the corresponding continuous operators in @xcite , whereas the methods in @xcite lose an additional factor of @xmath48 .",
    "in the last section , using theorem [ thm : var ] and some transference principle for @xmath0-variations we change the weights in the averages and prove theorem [ thm : var  ] .      throughout the paper ,",
