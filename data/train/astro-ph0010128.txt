    "the `` antennae '' galaxies ( arp  244 , ngc  4038/39 , vv  245 ) , the nearest ir - luminous and perhaps the youngest prototypical galaxy - galaxy merger ( the first in toomre ( 1977 ) merger sequence ) , certainly reclaimed its fame from the recent releases of the hst / wfpc2 images ( whitmore 1999 ) and the chandra x - ray images ( fabbiano 2000 ) , and the observations at essentially all available wavelengths from radio to x - ray ( , hummel & van der hulst 1986 ; neff , & ulvestad 2000 ; hibbard , van der hulst , & barnes 2001 in preparation ; bushouse , telesco , & werner 1998 ; nikola 1998 ; mirabel 1998 ; vigroux 1996 ; read , ponman , & wolstencroft 1995 ; fabbiano , schweizer , & mackie 1997 ) .",
    "the hst images reveal over one thousand bright young star clusters that are thought to have formed in recent bursts of star formation .",
    "imaging also shows the most recent locations of the star - forming giant hii regions and their velocity fields as well  ( rubin , ford , & dodorico 1970 ; amram 1992 ; whitmore 1999 ) .",
    "soft x - ray  ( fabbiano 1997 ) and radio continuum  ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ) images may hint of previous star formation sites currently seen as supernova remnants .",
    "in addition , mid - infrared ( mir )  ( mirabel 1998 ; vigroux 1996 ) , far - infrared ( fir )  ( evans , harper , & helou 1997 ; r. evans 1998 , private communications ; bushouse 1998 ) and submillimeter ( haas 2000 ) images indicate that the most intense starburst takes place currently in an off - nucleus region that is inconspicuous at optical wavelengths .",
    "the star - forming molecular gas in arp  244 is perhaps least understood , however ; we show in this paper that the total molecular gas mass accepted in the literature for the last decade  ( sanders & mirabel 1985 ; stanford 1990 ) has been underestimated by nearly a factor of 6 .",
    "the importance of gas during galaxy - galaxy merging far exceeds its mass proportion , as demonstrated by the sophisticated numerical simulations  ( , barnes & hernquist 1996 , 1998 ) . at a distance of 20 mpc ( @xmath9  mpc@xmath10 , , van der hulst 1979 ; mihos , bothun , & richstone 1993 ; mirabel 1998 ) , the total ir luminosity ( 81000 @xmath11 m , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) of arp  244 , measured from the _ iras _ four - band fluxes given in soifer ( 1989 ) , is @xmath12 . using the most recent remeasured total _ iras _ fluxes ( as opposed to simply the `` point source '' in soifer 1989 ) in the revised bright galaxy sample ( d.b .",
    "sanders 2000 , private communication ; sanders , mazzarella , kim , & surace 2001 in preparation ) , the same ir luminosity is obtained .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking arp  244 is not a luminous infrared galaxy ( lig , @xmath13 ) unless a virgocentric flow distance of 29.5 mpc is used ( sanders 2000 , but we use 20 mpc throughout this paper ) , which leads to @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a much smaller molecular gas mass of @xmath16   ( sanders & mirabel 1985 ) , currently accepted in the literature , leads to a higher global ratio of @xmath17 .",
    "this ratio is often referred as the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) since the fir emission , tracer of current star formation rate , has been normalized by the molecular gas mass available to make stars . with this high yield of young stars per unit molecular gas mass and a lower molecular gas content ,",
    "most of the molecular gas will be depleted in @xmath18 years , as noted by sanders & mirabel ( 1985 ) and stanford ( 1990 ) . there would be no chance for arp  244 to become an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulig , @xmath19 ) in the late stage of the merging .",
    "numerical modeling ( mihos 1993 ) , based on this lower gas mass , indeed predicted that arp  244 would not join the rank of uligs .",
    "uligs , with the ir luminosity comparable to the bolometric luminosity of qsos , are the most luminous galaxies in the local universe .",
    "they are believed to be powered mainly by starbursts ( e.g. , smith , lonsdale , & lonsdale 1998 ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) taking place predominantly in the _ extreme starburst _ regions of a characteristic size of @xmath20 pc and @xmath21 ( downes & solomon 1998 ) , produced as a result of the merging of molecular _ gas - rich _ spiral galaxies ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . alternatively",
    ", the dust - enshrouded active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may still be responsible for significant energy output in some uligs ( sanders 1988 ; veilleux , sanders , & kim 1999 ; sanders 1999 ) .",
    "now , for a total molecular gas mass of @xmath22 , based on our fully sampled co(1 - 0 ) observations obtained at the nrao 12 m , many previous conclusions and speculations about arp  244 need to be revised .",
    "after all , the initial gas content , particularly the molecular gas  the fuel for star formation , will probably be the most important factor in determining whether a merging pair of spiral galaxies reaches the peak of ultraluminous extreme starburst phase since all uligs are still gas - rich with @xmath23   molecular gas mass ( solomon 1997 ) , most likely concentrated in the kpc scale disks / rings around the merging nuclei ( downes & solomon 1998 ; scoville , yun , & bryant 1997 ; sakamoto 1999 ; cf .",
    "evans , surace , & mazzarella 2000 ) .    with a molecular gas mass comparable to that of uligs and an early / intermediate merging stage , arp 244 is perhaps an example of what an ulig might have looked like a few hundred million years ago .",
    "arp 244 may be a snapshot in the evolution of a typical gas - rich merger into an ulig system .",
    "thus , it is crucial to understand how , where and when the starbursts initiate or have occurred in such an on - going merger .",
    "this becomes especially imperative in arp  244 given the advantage of its close - up distance and therefore the better linear resolution available .",
    "nonetheless , the strongest starburst site revealed from the infrared space observatory ( @xmath24 ) mir images ( vigroux 1996 ; mirabel 1998 ; xu 2000 ) seems to be offset from the peak emission in all the 60 , 100 , and 160 @xmath11 m fir maps of the limited resolution , obtained with the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao , evans , harper , & helou 1997 ; bushouse 1998 ) . in order to best locate the sites of the intense star formation",
    ", high - resolution imaging in the fir is ultimately required .    since there is an excellent correlation between the fir and the radio continuum emission ( , helou , soifer , & rowan - robinson 1985 ;",
    "condon 1990 ; condon 1992 ; xu 1994 ; marsh & helou 1995 ) , the fir emission can thus be approximately scaled according to the radio continuum emission with the high resolution achievable by the very large array ( vla ) observations .",
    "we have therefore , obtained the vla radio continuum images to compare with our high - resolution full - synthesis berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) plus the nrao 12 m co maps .",
    "this is because the star formation occurs within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , especially the dense cores and starburst can be better characterized by the elevated sfe , i.e. , the fir to co ratio , approximated here by the radio - to - co ratio . therefore , local sfe across over the merging system can be approximately measured using the ratio map of the radio continuum to the co emission to locate the most intense starburst sites of the highest radio - to - co ratios .",
    "we here briefly report our various observations in  2 detailing the single - dish co mapping in arp  244 .",
    "the bima interferometry co and the vla 20 cm continuum observations will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the observational results and analysis are summarized and compared in  3 .",
    "section 4 discusses the starburst properties of arp  244 and the implications of our observations .",
    "finally , we conclude our main results .",
    "we obtained the nrao 12 m single - dish co(1 - 0 ) map at nyquist sampling ( half - beam spacing @xmath25 ) in order to determine the true total co extent and distribution and help add in the zero - spacing flux missed from the multifield bima co(1 - 0 ) data cube .",
    "a total of more than 50 positions have been observed in 1998 march and 20 more positions in the outer edge of the map were further obtained in 1998 april to fully cover the entire co emission region .",
    "we have essentially integrated for at least 1.5 hr at every position in order to make sure that not only no further @xmath26 level co emission is detected in the outmost edge of the map but all spectra obtained at different positions have roughly comparable rms noise level as well .",
    "a total of 73 positions have been mapped in the merging disks accumulating more than 110 hr useful integration time .",
    "additional observations in 1999 june and november have been conducted remotely in the southeastern ( se ) extension of the disk overlap region ( where the much longer southern tidal tail starts ) and at the tip of the southern tail ( figure  1 ) .",
    "this is to further integrate down the noise level to clearly show that co is detected significantly far away from the merging disks , and to possibly search for co emission at the location of the tidal dwarf galaxy , several tens of kpc away from the merging disks .",
    "the typical integration time at each of these selected positions is more than 3 hr .",
    "we have tried several positions at the tip of the southern tidal tail and deep integrations in the possibly detected positions were further conducted in 2000 march and april , totaling 27 hr usable integration time in this tidal feature area .",
    "we used the dual sis 3mmhi receivers connected with both the two 256@xmath02 mhz filter banks and the two 600 mhz spectrometers providing a velocity resolution of 2mhz @xmath27   and a total velocity coverage of 1330  .",
    "the system temperature @xmath28 ( ssb ) was typically less than 400  k ( on a @xmath29 scale ) and the weather conditions were excellent throughout almost all observing runs . occasionally , exceptional weather with @xmath30  k ( for a low - decl .",
    "southern sky source at 115 ghz ! ) was seen in a few days .",
    "all observations were performed using a subreflector nutating at a chop rate of 1.25 hz with a beam throw of @xmath31 plus a position switch ( the so - called `` bsp '' mode ) to achieve the flat baselines .",
    "this ensures that the off - source reference sky position is 6@xmath32 away from the observed on - source pointing so that the telescope beam ( fwhm@xmath33 ) at the reference position is well outside the co extent of arp  244 .",
    "pointing and focus have been monitored frequently every 12 hr by observing nearby quasars 3c279 or 3c273 ( and occasionally planets at the beginning of the observations ) .",
    "uncertainties in positioning are typically @xmath34 .",
    "calibration with the standard chopper - wheel method was performed once after every the other 6 minute integration scan and yielded an antenna temperature on a @xmath29 scale .",
    "further absolute flux calibrations in the antenna temperature scale have been performed by the repeated observations of the northern nucleus ( our map center ) during different observing sessions and by the observations of some nearest well - observed starburst galaxies . comparing the observed line strengths and profiles",
    ", we found that the consistency is satisfactory and the difference is less than @xmath35 .",
    "hcn(1 - 0 ) was observed in 1997 april at only two locations : the northern nucleus ( ngc  4038 ) and the co peaks in the overlap region ( figure  1 ) .",
    "this was part of another project to search for the hcn emission in the lig mergers .",
    "additional integrations at these two locations were obtained in 1999 november as a further consistency check .",
    "the 12 m telescope s fwhm beam at 89 ghz ( @xmath36 ) , pointed at the nucleus of ngc  4038 , presumably covers all hcn emission in ngc  4038 , yet excludes emission from that of ngc  4039 and most of the disk overlap region .",
    "the second hcn beam covers not only all the co peaks and the extended co in the overlap but also most co emission in ngc  4039 .",
    "therefore , the total hcn emission from arp  244 can be roughly sampled by simply summing up these two beam measurements .",
    "@xmath28 on a @xmath29   scale is about 230 k with the dual sis 3mmlo receivers and the same back ends as used in the co observations .",
    "we have accumulated a total integration time of nearly 5 and 7 hr for ngc  4038 and the overlap / ngc  4039 , respectively .",
    "our data reduction was performed using the class / gildas package .",
    "each individual scan was checked for spikes / dips or bad channels and curvatures in the baseline .",
    "scans with the structured baselines have been abandoned , bad channels have been `` repaired '' by interpolation using the adjacent channels , and a linear baseline was then subtracted after removal of the spikes / dips for each accepted scan .",
    "all scans at each same position have then been summed to obtain an average spectrum .",
    "the data cubes of the different velocity spacings were also created from the highest velocity resolution ( 2mhz @xmath27 ) and the smoothed ( e.g. , 4mhz @xmath37 ) spectra maps .",
    "all spectra presented in this paper have been smoothed to 8 mhz ( @xmath38 for co and @xmath39 for hcn ) .",
    "the currently accepted total molecular gas mass in arp  244 is based on a single pointing observation with the 12 m in the overlap region .",
    "sanders & mirabel ( 1985 ) listed an integrated intensity of 15.9 k  , or a total co flux of only 556.5 jy  ( @xmath40  jy / k on a @xmath29 scale ) , leading to a molecular gas mass of 2.6@xmath41  .",
    "the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array s two overlapping field ( fwhm@xmath42 ) co imaging only recovered @xmath43 co flux ( stanford 1990 ) of the one - beam ( fwhm@xmath33 ) 12 m measurement !",
    "the 12 m beam observed in sanders & mirabel ( 1985 ) only covered part of the overlap region , neither the nuclear regions of ngc  4038 and ngc  4039 nor the extended structures throughout the entire merging disks ( see figures  1 and 2 ) .",
    "apparently , much of the co is distributed over a much larger area than the 55@xmath44 beam ( figure  2 ) .",
    "furthermore , the integrated co line intensity in the old 12 m observation was also underestimated owing to the insufficient velocity coverage ( figure  3 , more in  3.2 ) .",
    "young ( 1995 ) observed 6 positions in ngc  4038 and one position in ngc  4039 with the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) 14 m ( fwhm @xmath45 ) and derived a total co flux of @xmath46 jy   assuming an uniform co disk of radius @xmath47 for ngc  4038 and an exponential co disk of a scale - length @xmath48 for ngc  4039 .",
    "aalto ( 1995 ) observed 3 positions in arp  244 with the swedish european submillimeter telescope ( sest ) 15 m ( fwhm @xmath49 ) , i.e. , the overlap region and the nuclear regions of ngc  4038 and ngc  4039 .",
    "a sum of the integrated co line intensities from the sest observations leads to a total co flux close to what has been estimated by young ( 1995 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the new ovro three - field imaging ( wilson 2000 ) appears to only recover a total co flux of 910 jy  , but this is already more than double that of the old ovro map of stanford ( 1990 ) .",
    "all these recent measurements of still very limited spatial coverage have already suggested that the total co flux in arp  244 can be a factor of a few larger than what has been previously accepted .",
    "figure  2 shows all the averaged co spectra made with the 12 m at a half - beam spacing , a total of 73 spectra with more than 50 firm detections .",
    "only co spectra at the outermost edge generally show non - detection or tentative detections ( noted in table  1 ) .",
    "many co spectra in the inner part of the map ( the disk overlap and the two nuclear regions ) have the integrated line intensities more than @xmath50 larger than that of the old 12 m measurement of sanders & mirabel ( 1985 ) .",
    "observations in 1999 june at the same position as that of sanders & mirabel ( 1985 ) gave an integrated line intensity exactly twice larger , consistent with those mapped in the nearby positions in 1998 march / april .",
    "the northern nucleus was always observed in all observing sessions giving consistent results of about same integrated co line intensity .",
    "figure  3 presents the three spectra obtained near the co peaks in the overlap region and compares with the original spectrum of sanders & mirabel ( 1985 ) .",
    "obviously , the old 12 m observation may have suffered severely from the poorly determined baseline owing to the limited bandwidth , as the broadest co spectra in the overlap region have fwzi @xmath51  .",
    "but , this is probably insufficient to explain a factor of 2 difference in the integrated co line intensity .",
    "additional errors in the telescope pointing and calibration together with the limited velocity coverage may have all contributed to the discrepancy .",
    "the total co flux , from our fully - sampled co observations ( summarized in table  1 ) , is @xmath52  jy   ( @xmath53  k  , using @xmath54  jy / k conversion for the @xmath29   antenna temperature scale ) , a factor of 5.7 larger than what was initially reported by sanders & mirabel ( 1985 ) .",
    "the total co luminosity is thus @xmath55  k  pc@xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , or a molecular gas mass ( 1.5@xmath58)@xmath59 ( using the standard co - to - h@xmath60 conversion factor of 3.0@xmath61  h@xmath60  @xmath62 , or m(h@xmath63/k",
    "pc@xmath56 )  , applicable to gmcs in the milky way disk , , solomon & barrett 1991 ; young & scoville 1991 ) .",
    "the error estimate is purely from the measurement uncertainties ( statistical errors from all measurements and the uncertainties in the co detections in the outer edge ) , additional uncertainties up to @xmath35 should be expected from the calibration and pointing etc .",
    "it is interesting to note that the new estimate of the dust mass in arp  244 , based upon the scuba 450 and 850 @xmath11 m measurements as well as the isophot observations at wavelength longer than 100 @xmath11 m , reveals a substantial amount of cold and warm dust , and leads to a total dust mass of @xmath64 ( haas 2000 ) .",
    "thus , for a total gas mass of @xmath65 [ @xmath66 , van der hulst 1979 ; hibbard 2001 in preparation ] , a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath67 is obtained .",
    "this is basically the same gas - to - dust ratio established in our galaxy and in some nearby spiral galaxies like ngc  891 ( alton 2000 ) .",
    "this simple consistency may also imply that the standard co - to - h@xmath60 conversion determined from gmcs in the milky way disk is likely applicable here and arp  244 is indeed molecular gas - rich .",
    "table  2 summarizes the global quantities of arp  244 .      although the most molecular gas is concentrated in the disk overlap region , the extended distribution of the molecular gas spreads essentially all over the merging disks , much further beyond the field of view of the wfpc2 ( figure  2 ) .",
    "there are also concentrations of the molecular gas in the two nuclear regions , particularly in the northern one .",
    "this is better indicated in the quite coarse channel map of 100   width ( figures  4a  e ) .",
    "in general , there are good correspondences between the co distribution and the optical morphology , except for the overlap region where the co emission appears to be much more prominent than the optical light .",
    "figure  4f further compares the co integrated intensity contours ( using all 74 position co observations ) with the optical disks .",
    "all these ( figures  4a4f ) clearly show that the molecular gas extends throughout the system and explain why the old 12 m single beam measurement underestimated the total co emission by a large factor .",
    "obviously , much of the co over a broad velocity range is simply distributed over several arcminutes , corresponds to a linear co extent of possibly beyond @xmath6820  kpc .",
    "the deep integration at the se edge of the overlap region , where the southern tidal tail begins , confirms the clear detections of the weak co emission from this region ( figure  5a ) .",
    "the central offset of the spectra shown in figure  5a is ( 110@xmath44 , @xmath69 ) relative to the northern nucleus , two full beams further out from the peak emission in the overlap region .",
    "co emission is also detected , for example , at offsets of ( 55@xmath44 , 55@xmath44 ) and ( 81@xmath44 , 27.5@xmath44 ) relative to the northern nucleus , and in a few locations west of the two nuclear regions at one and half beams from the nuclei ( figure  2 and table  1 ) .",
    "these locations are so far away from the co emission peaks and their immediately associated co extensions ( also see the new ovro map of wilson ( 2000 ) ) , suggesting that there are weak extended co features across over the entire optical disks . given the relatively quite strong co emission and the large distance from the co emission peaks , it is unlikely that both the pointing errors , as large as 10@xmath44 in some rare occasion , and the telescope beam pattern ( sidelobes ) can produce such relatively strong co emission that we have detected near the map edge .",
    "this certainly points out the importance of the complete coverage of the merging systems in the single beam observations since they may systematically underestimate the total co content in the cases where the merging disks are larger than the single beam .",
    "a substantial amount of the molecular gas may be distributed at large galactic radii , especially in the young , early and intermediate stage mergers like the `` antennae '' galaxies .",
    "the overall velocity spread of the molecular gas is more than 600   across over the two merging disks .",
    "the narrowest velocity ranges are observed in the nuclear region of the northern face - on galaxy ngc  4038 ( fwzi  @xmath70 , fwhm  @xmath20  ) , whereas a broader velocity spread ( fwzi  @xmath71 , fwhm  @xmath72  ) can be seen in the southern inclined galaxy ngc  4039 .",
    "the broadest velocity components ( fwzi  @xmath73  600  , fwhm  @xmath74  ) are particularly prominent south of ngc  4039 even though the co emission is quite weak ( figure  2 and nos .",
    "6 , 9 , 17 , 27 , & 29 in table  1 ) .",
    "it is likely that the interferometric observations have almost entirely resolved and thus missed these weak and broad velocity features .",
    "the velocity extent around the peak co emission in the overlap has a similarly broad velocity range .",
    "also , the velocity spread of most spectra in the overlap region lies between the two extremes observed in the two galaxies .",
    "this is obvious since some spectra contain the co contribution from either ngc  4038 or ngc  4039 or both .",
    "but , clearly most spectra at a full beam ( or more ) eastern of the nuclei are basically free from any contribution of the nuclear co emission .",
    "we also notice that , although the difference is small ( @xmath75 ) , the systemic velocity in the overlap region is lower than that of the entire system whereas the systemic velocity south of ngc  4039 is higher .",
    "this perhaps reminisces the disk rotation of the molecular gas in the more inclined galaxy ngc  4039 .",
    "nonetheless , the average velocities of the molecular gas in the nuclear regions of both galaxies are about same as the systemic velocity of the entire system .",
    "the detailed study of the molecular gas distribution and kinematics is difficult given the limited resolution of the 12 m telescope beam , which will be thoroughly described in the presentation of the bima + nrao 12 m full - synthesis observations , providing a much improved spatial resolution of nearly 10 times better .",
    "although the enormous amount of molecular gas in the overlap region must originate from both spiral galaxy progenitors , the kinematics and the proximity of the molecular gas in the overlap , combined with the similar velocity spread of the molecular gas motion as that in the southern galaxy ngc  4039 , seem to suggest that the most molecular gas in the overlap could be originated from the southern progenitor",
    ". the molecular gas content of the two progenitors might be initially comparable and both were gas - rich .",
    "however , the vla hi observations appear to show that the progenitor of ngc  4039 was gas poor since the most hi in this system is currently in the southern tail extending from ngc  4038 ( hibbard 2001 in preparation ) .",
    "we have also searched for the faint possible co emission at several positions in the southern tidal dwarf galaxy ( schweizer 1978 ; mirabel 1992 ) at the tip of the tidal tail .",
    "a possible weak co detection from the beam at position ra=12:01:26.0 , dec=@xmath7619:00:37.5 ( j2000 ) appears to be at the @xmath77 level ( an integration of more than 12 hr ; fig .",
    "an average of the summed spectra of all observations at the 5 different positions we have searched ( accumulated an integration time of more than 27 hr ) , appears to confirm the weak co detection at the @xmath78 level .",
    "all these observed positions are selected to be around the regions of the highest hi column density , where the vla hi observations ( hibbard 2000 ) have revealed some large concentrations of the atomic gas , distributed extendedly around the region of the tidal dwarf galaxy and along the southern tidal tail .",
    "the weak co detections ( figure  5b ) have also shown the same velocity range as the atomic gas velocity spread , revealed from the vla hi channel maps , further indicating that the weak co emission is likely real . yet the much deeper integration and the more observing positions in this region are still required in order to firmly present the co detections at the very high significant levels , and to possibly obtain a better understanding of the weak co distribution and kinematics in a tidal dwarf galaxy .    the integrated co line intensity from the detected position is @xmath79  k  .",
    "the average spectrum of the sum from all other 4 locations ( not shown here ) appears to give a similar integrated co line intensity @xmath80  k  , while the average spectrum of all observations gives an integrated co line intensity @xmath81  k  .",
    "earlier observations by smith & higdon ( 1994 ) failed to detect any co emission , but our observations here are much more sensitive . using the standard co - to - h@xmath60 conversion factor , we therefore obtain a minimum molecular gas mass for the tidal dwarf galaxy @xmath82 if only the detected position is considered .",
    "it is likely that the weak co emission exists in other locations in this region and the total molecular gas mass for the entire tidal dwarf galaxy can be a factor of several larger . indeed , the summed average spectrum of all the 5 position observations seems to suggest a molecular gas mass @xmath83 .",
    "anyway , this molecular gas mass appears to be larger than that of the molecular complexes detected in the m81 group ( brouillet , henkel , & baudry 1992 ; walter & heithausen 1999 ) , yet comparable to the molecular gas mass detected in the other two tidal dwarf galaxies ( braine et al .",
    "it is possible that most of the molecular gas might have come directly from the conversion of hi into h@xmath60 .",
    "this is similar to the case in the two tidal dwarf galaxies where the molecular gas was detected in regions of the highest hi concentrations ( braine et al .",
    "2000 ) , and is also related to the case in the cold intragroup medium where huge hi concentrations and the co detection are both associated with the intragroup starburst ( gao & xu 2000 ) in the famous compact galaxy group stephan s quintet .",
    "the high dipole - moment molecules like hcn , which traces the dense molecular gas at density @xmath84  @xmath4 , are better tracers of the star - forming gas than that of co  ( solomon 1992 ; gao 1996 ; gao & solomon 2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "we have detected the weak hcn(1 - 0 ) emission from the two positions , one at the nucleus of ngc  4038 and the other covering both the disk overlap and the nuclear region of ngc  4039 ( fwhm@xmath36 at 89  ghz , the two thick circles in fig .",
    "1 ) . figure  5c shows the two hcn spectra and the total hcn luminosity can be estimated by the sum of the two beam measurements .",
    "this is because , in nearby galaxies where hcn maps exist , the dense molecular gas tends to be concentrated in the innermost disks of the highest density regions ( gao 1996 ; helfer & blitz 1997a ) .",
    "thus it is unlikely that any significant hcn emission in arp  244 still exists outside the coverage of the two hcn beams .",
    "we estimated the total hcn flux to be @xmath85  jy  ( @xmath86  k  , using a @xmath87  jy / k conversion ) and the hcn luminosity @xmath88  k  pc@xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the luminosity ratio of @xmath89 implies only @xmath90 of the molecular gas is at high density of @xmath3  @xmath4 in arp  244 ( gao 1996 ; gao & solomon 2000a ) .",
    "this is surprisingly low since uligs can have as high as @xmath91 and up to about half of the molecular gas at density @xmath3  @xmath4  ( solomon 1992 ; gao 1996 ; gao & solomon 2000a ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath92 in arp  244 is actually just comparable to that of the milky way disk ( helfer & blitz 1997b ) , even lower than that of some `` normal '' spiral galaxies ( gao & solomon 2000a ) .",
    "the fraction of the dense molecular gas in arp  244 is apparently the lowest among all ligs observed so far .",
    "although most of the co emission ( @xmath93 ) is from the overlap region , the hcn emission in the overlap appears to be less than half since only about half of the hcn emission is originated from both ngc  4039 and the overlap .",
    "the hcn detection from the overlap region and ngc  4039 has only a comparable integrated line intensity , but weaker in the antenna temperature as compared with the detection in ngc  4038 .",
    "the two hcn spectra differ clearly in the velocity spread : a narrow velocity space in the hcn emission of ngc  4038 whereas a much broader velocity spread in ngc  4039 and the overlap region .",
    "thus , the hcn spectra basically indicate that the dense molecular gas could have the similar gas kinematics as that of the total molecular gas revealed from the co emission even though their spatial distributions are probably totally different .",
    "the low fraction of the dense molecular gas in arp  244 , especially in the overlap region , is consistent with the fact that the bulk of the molecular gas in the overlap is extensively distributed both spatially and kinematically ( figs .  2 , 3 and 4 ) .",
    "although there are several co peaks in the high resolution synthesis maps , none of them has the extremely high concentrations of molecular gas as those found in uligs .",
    "the highest gas surface density in the northern nucleus is @xmath94 pc@xmath95 ( resolved on a linear scale of @xmath96  kpc as in both the bima plus nrao 12 m and the new ovro co maps ) , order of magnitude smaller than those in uligs , whereas the gas surface density in the southern nuclear region is lower by at least a factor of 3 and comparable to that of the co peaks in the overlap .",
    "our low - resolution ( 55@xmath97  kpc ) 12 m map reveals a co peak in the disk overlap region since most of the molecular gas is concentrated there .",
    "the peak molecular gas column density n(h@xmath60 ) is close to 10@xmath98 cm@xmath95 , i.e. , an average gas surface density ( over @xmath27  kpc scale ) of about 190  pc@xmath95 .",
    "this low gas surface density together with the low hcn - to - co line luminosity ratio clearly marks the unique gas properties in arp  244 , in sharp contrast with those in most ligs / uligs .",
    "there is apparently a correlation between the radio continuum and the co emission as even so indicated in the old ovro co map ( hummel & van der hulst 1986 ; stanford 1990 ) .",
    "particularly , most of the radio continuum emission is extensively concentrated in the overlap region with a very similar morphology to that of the co. the direct comparison of the @xmath100 m maps ( evans 1997 ) with our full - synthesis co images clearly reveals that the average fir to co ratio in the overlap region is higher than the global ratio since most of the fir emission ( @xmath101 ) is from the overlap region , whereas only @xmath102 co emission is from the same region .",
    "therefore , the average sfe in the overlap can be a bit higher than the global value ( which is @xmath103 , or 5.3  /   if a higher 100  @xmath11 m kao flux of bushouse ( 1998 ) is used ) , still comparable to that of gmcs in the galactic disk and an order of magnitude lower than that of uligs ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ; solomon 1997 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the average sfe in the nuclear regions is expected to be lower than the global value since the two nuclear regions have extremely weak fir emission , whereas the co is highly concentrated , particularly in ngc  4038 . moreover , the radio continuum emission has indeed an excellent correspondence with the fir maps , just as expected from the well - known correlation between the radio continuum and the fir emission ( , helou 1985 ; marsh & helou 1995 ) .    in order to further quantify the local star formation properties and better identify the sites of the most intense starbursts with the highest sfe , we have produced the ratio map of the vla 20 cm radio continuum to the co(1 - 0 ) emission .",
    "since the tight fir / radio correlation is also valid on kpc scale in galaxies ( , marsh & helou 1995 ; lu 1996 ) , the radio continuum emission can be used as a tracer of the recent star formation in galaxies as well ( , condon 1990 , 1991 ; condon 1992 ) .",
    "we here use the radio continuum maps to roughly indicate the star formation sites .",
    "thus , a high resolution indicator of the fir emission can be inferred by scaling the fir according to the radio continuum emission . comparing the radio continuum maps with the detailed molecular gas distribution from the co imaging ,",
    "we can obtain the radio - to - co ratio map to reveal the local sfe , which is defined as the local ratio of the star formation rate to the molecular gas mass . both the vla 20 cm continuum and the bima plus the nrao 12 m full - synthesis co maps have about same resolution ,",
    "thus a direct division can be performed to obtain the ratio map .",
    "the radio continuum to the co ratios have been plotted as contours and compared with the hst / wfpc2 ( fig .",
    "6 ) and the vla radio continuum images ( fig .  7 ) .",
    "apparently , a rather smooth distribution of the radio - to - co ratio is observed across over most of the merging disks .",
    "the sites of the highest ratios , @xmath104 and 5 times above the average , have been indicated in figure  6 as black and white contours , respectively , and they coincide well with the dusty patches across over the hst / wfpc2 image .",
    "the sites of the highest radio - to - co ratios are exclusively localized in the most prominent dusty regions in the overlap , which are near the co peaks and probably the fir emission peaks . the correspondent highest sfe is therefore @xmath5 since the global average sfe is 4.2 /.",
    "interestingly , almost all ligs / uligs have sfe @xmath105 ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , although some early stage pre - merging ligs with sfe @xmath106 and lower do exist ( , arp  302 , lo , gao , & gruendl 1997 ) .",
    "consistent with what can be roughly expected from a direct comparison of the fir map at 60  @xmath11 m with the co images in the nuclear regions , both nuclei have only a low radio - to - co ratio , about the average or lower ( fig .",
    "thus the sfe in the nuclear regions is about 4 /.",
    "the @xmath24 mir `` hotspots '' have higher ratios than the average , so do the extended overlap region and the western star - forming loop in ngc  4038 , in addition to a few spots around the nuclear regions ( especially the circumnuclear region of ngc  4038 , fig .",
    "but these are a factor of 2 lower than the highest ratios and are only of moderate starburst sites with a sfe @xmath107 , which is actually the typical sfe value for the local starburst galaxies ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "both observational and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the ultraluminous extreme starburst phase is most likely achieved in the molecular _ gas - rich _ mergers ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; downes & solomon 1998 ; gao & solomon 1999 ) where starbursts may proceed through the formation of numerous super - star clusters ( e.g. , whitmore 1999 ; surace 1998 ; scoville 2000 ) . multiwavelength observations of arp  244 and comparison with the early stage mergers observed by gao ( 1999 ) are therefore especially crucial to track how and when the dominant sources of star formation transform from within the disks of the two _ gas - rich _ spirals to the disk - disk overlap regions between the two galaxies .",
    "moreover , comparative study with co observations of the late stage mergers ( downes & solomon 1998 ; bryant & scoville 1999 ) are also equally important for understanding how the starbursts continue to evolve from taking place predominantly in the overlap regions to occurring mainly in nuclear regions when the merging advances to ulig phase , with extraordinary nuclear concentrations of dense gas .",
    "intermediate mergers like arp  244 serve apparently as an important link in the merging process between a pair of gas - rich premergers and the merged double - nucleus ulig .",
    "we here discuss only the starburst properties of arp  244 related to our 12 m observations .",
    "the co content is decreasing as merging progresses , indicating the depletion of molecular gas due to merger - induced starburst ( gao & solomon 1999 ) . using the scaling of m(h@xmath108 ( gao & solomon 1999 , valid for mergers at the early and intermediate stages , with the projected nuclear separation 20  @xmath109  2  kpc ) ,",
    "the total molecular gas will decrease roughly by more than a factor of 2 when arp  244 reaches @xmath1102 kpc , prior to or about entering into the late merging stage .",
    "it appears that all uligs observed so far have @xmath23   of molecular gas mass or more without exception , even after considering up to a factor of 5 reduced co - to - h@xmath60 conversion ( solomon 1997 ) .",
    "the ultraluminous starburst phase of arp  244 is thus possibly reachable in the advanced stage since only @xmath23   molecular gas will be consumed by the newborn stars in the next @xmath18 yr of the merging process .",
    "there will still be abundant molecular gas of close to @xmath111   available , not to mention the additional amount of atomic gas in the merging disks and in the long tidal tails ( hibbard 2001 in preparation ) that may eventually fall back to the merging disks ( hibbard 1994 ) .",
    "the atomic gas could be an additional gas reservoir for possible conversion into the molecular phase , because there appears to be some evidence that uligs tend to have the highest ratio of m(h@xmath60)/m(hi ) ( , mirabel & sanders 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "in general , the gas surface density increases from orders of a few times 10@xmath56 pc@xmath95 to a few times 10@xmath112 pc@xmath95 , as merging progresses from early to intermediate stages  ( gao 1999 ) ( unresolved on a scale of 12 kpc ) , whereas advanced ulig mergers such as arp  220 have gas surface density typically greater than @xmath113 pc@xmath95  ( scoville 1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ; sakamoto 1999 ) .",
    "although the total molecular gas content of arp  244 is comparable to that of uligs , the gas surface density is still orders of magnitude lower than that of uligs , e.g. , in the overlap , @xmath114  pc@xmath95 on a scale of 5 kpc and @xmath115  pc@xmath95 on a resolved scale of sub - kpc .",
    "therefore , only a small fraction of the molecular gas in arp  244 is actually at a high enough gas surface density for a high sfe , as formulated in the schmidt law ( , kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the overall gas density is low to maintain a low sfe across over the entire system , except for some localized starburst regions ( fig .",
    "6 ) , just as our hcn observations have revealed that little dense molecular gas available currently to power the extreme starbursts .",
    "ultraluminous extreme starbursts require not only a large quantity of molecular gas but also a high gas concentration , particularly the nuclear gas concentration , so that the bulk of the molecular gas is at a high density .",
    "the large quantity of pre - existing molecular ism is the sufficient fuel for arp  244 to ultimately reach the onset of the ultraluminous starburst phase , as the merging proceeds to the advanced stage , and the bulk of the molecular gas becomes highly condensed . unlike most ligs / uligs , which show the dominant nuclear mir and perhaps fir emission ( hwang 1999 ;",
    "soifer 2000 ; bushouse 1998 ; xu 2000 ) , arp  244 has only moderate nuclear emission in mir ( mirabel 1998 ; xu 2000 ) , and the @xmath116 m emission from the two nuclei is extremely weak ( evans 1997 ) .",
    "although there is no clear indication of a large stellar bulge in either of the galaxies , the concentrations of the molecular gas as well as the stars in the nuclear regions in arp  244 perhaps also draw some analogies to the case of galaxy - galaxy merger model with stellar bulges in the progenitors ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) . in reality , arp  244 is probably more in between the two extreme cases modeled by mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) . according to the models ( see figure  5 in mihos & hernquist 1996 ) ,",
    "the first peak of starburst phase has recently passed in arp  244 , shortly after the pair s first closest approach , perhaps as evidenced by numerous young star clusters in the hst / wfpc2 images .",
    "thus , arp  244 could have just phased out the bona fide starburst lig stage . as more and more gas continues to accumulate in both the overlap and the two nuclear regions , the further nuclear gas concentrations and",
    "the continuous star formation can build stronger bulges that can help stabilize the disks against the bar formation , lower the sfe levels during the merging , and leave enough gas for the strongest final starburst when the two galaxies eventually coalesce , with almost all the molecular gas collapsed into a kpc double - nucleus region .",
    "more than an order of magnitude increase in the sfe , combined with an abundant molecular gas supply of @xmath23  , will be just sufficient to make arp  244 into @xmath117  .",
    "interestingly , there also appears to be some quite widely separated uligs ( @xmath118  10  kpc ) , which might still be in their early stage of merging , but may have passed their first closest impacts , and may have just been experiencing their first strongest starbursts ( murphy 2000 ) .    in summary ,",
    "a preexisting abundant molecular gas content is a necessary for there to be a possibility of a merging spiral pair reaching the ultraluminous starburst phase .",
    "arp  244 , with a large quantity of molecular gas available at low density , a _ low _",
    "sfe , a moderate fir luminosity or star formation rate , and yet a relatively early / intermediate stage of merging , has the potential of producing an ultraluminous extreme starburst in late stage of merging , when the molecular gas complexes in the overlap region eventually merge with the nuclear gas concentrations and finally collapse into a kpc - scale double - nucleus gas disk .",
    "the well - known correlation between the fir thermal dust emission and the radio continuum synchrotron emission , unexpected as they are apparently two unrelated physical mechanisms , is probably the tightest relation known among the global quantities of galaxies ( e.g. , helou 1985 ; condon 1992 ; xu 1994 ) .",
    "the morphologies of the two emission are also similar and the correlation between them appears to hold down to kpc scale within individual galaxies ( e.g. , bicay , condon , & helou 1989 ; marsh & helou 1995 ; lu 1996 ) .",
    "based on these , we approximately scaled the local fir emission according to the radio continuum emission , and compared with the molecular gas distribution to measure the local sfe .",
    "we have clearly identified that the most intense bursts of star formation ( the sites of the highest sfe , i.e. , the highest radio - to - co ratios , figure  6 ) , currently being observed , are not in the concentrations of the optically revealed star clusters , or even the peaks of the mir emission , nor necessarily at the exact locations of the co and 20 cm radio continuum emission peaks . instead , the strongest starbursts appear to be confined in small regions near the co , radio continuum , and fir emission peaks in the overlap region .",
    "the bulk of the molecular gas across over the entire system is making stars with a rather modest or `` normal '' sfe ( fig .",
    "let us emphasize what we have learned from our observations and the various other observations .",
    "starbursts have apparently been going on or happened in some regions in arp  244 as evidenced by super - star clusters  ( whitmore 1999 ) and the mir `` hotspots '' in the overlap  ( mirabel 1998 ) . yet",
    ", most of the fir emission ( as well as the mir ) , which dominates the total energy output , comes from the overlap region ( evans 1997 ; bushouse 1998 ) , where most molecular gas resides , rather than from the super - star cluster concentrations .",
    "although arp  244 has long been claimed as the nearest archetypal starburst merger , our observations show that the molecular gas is rather extensively distributed over the entire merging disks , though most is still in the overlap , and the bulk of the molecular gas is only making stars at a low sfe .",
    "the entire system is presently not undergoing a global burst of star formation , even though some localized starbursts are occurring in the overlap , and a global starburst could have just peaked recently , right after the first closest impact responsible for the formation of the tidal tails .",
    "whitmore ( 1999 ) found that the star clusters at the edge of the dusty overlap region appear to be the youngest , with ages @xmath119 myr , while the star clusters in the western loop in ngc  4038 appear to be 5 - 10 myr old .",
    "indeed , these are the sites of the most intense and moderate starbursts respectively as revealed by the radio - to - co ratio map in figure  6",
    ". there might be many youngest star clusters totally obscured by the dust at the most intense starburst sites , contributing significantly to the dominant energy output in the overlap region .",
    "on the other hand , many star clusters in the northeastern that appear to be @xmath20  myr old , and even older star clusters across over the system , are not the current starburst sites , contributing little to the total fir emission .",
    "these old star clusters are probably related to the recent large - scale active star formation happened after the first closest encounter .",
    "the excellent agreement among the sites of the highest radio - to - co ratios , the dark patches in the hst / wfpc2 images , and the youngest ages of the star clusters , is striking .",
    "apparently both the most intense localized starbursts and the overall large - scale star formation are occurring in the overlap region , where all the co , [ c  @xmath120 line ( nikola 1998 ) , fir , and radio continuum show high concentrations .",
    "but , the confined intense starburst sites , which are heavily obscured in the dust , have only sfe @xmath5 , just reaching the typical sfe level for ligs / uligs .",
    "on the other hand , the average sfe in the overlap is just slightly larger than 4  / , still comparable with that of the galactic disk gmcs .",
    "one caveat is that arp  244 may be twice luminous in 100 @xmath11 m , as measured by the kao ( compared with that of the @xmath121 measurement , bushouse 1998 ) , although the 60 @xmath11 m measurements agree ( evans 1997 ) .",
    "this discrepancy needs future fir observations to resolve .",
    "more importantly , it is perfectly possible that the standard co - to - h@xmath60 conversion factor can be an overestimate for the total molecular gas mass .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the global sfe in arp  244 can be up to more than a factor of 2 larger than that of the gmcs in the milky way disk .",
    "this may indeed suggest that an enhanced global sfe proceeds throughout the entire merging disks while some confined strongest starbursts have a highest sfe much larger than 20  / , typical for uligs . in any case",
    ", the highest radio - to - co ratio sites could actually be bona fide sites of the _ current _ starbursts with an elevated sfe , and may contribute a significant fraction to the total fir emission , even though most of the fir emission may still come from the regions of a normal or modest sfe .    using the [ c  @xmath120/co(1 - 0 ) line ratio to distinguish between starburst activity in galaxies and more quiescent regions ( stacey 1991 ) , nikola ( 1998 ) concluded that there is no strong starburst activity taking place in arp  244 on a scale of @xmath27  kpc , the resolution of their data .",
    "this is roughly in agreement with our results since starburst sites are only identified on a scale of @xmath122  kpc ( fig .",
    "nikola ( 1998 ) further argued that most of the [ c  @xmath120 emission might have come from the confined active star forming regions surrounded with the more quiescent gmcs .",
    "our results appear to support this claim if indeed the sites of the intense starbursts , which are identified from the high radio - to - co ratios ( fig .",
    "6 ) , are producing the bulk of the [ c  @xmath120 emission .",
    "additional supports for the confined starbursts in small regions in the overlap are the recent iso - sws measurements ( kunze 1996 ) and the iso - lws observations , including the detection of br@xmath123 knots in the overlap interaction zone ( fischer 1996 )",
    ".    the rather extended moderate starbursts also coexist closely with the confined , most intense starbursts in the overlap region .",
    "other interesting sites of moderate starbursts are the western loop / ring structure , and part of the @xmath124  kpc scale circumnuclear regions ( mainly in ngc  4038 ) , but not the nuclei themselves ( figs .",
    "6 & 7 ) , with nearly 3 times higher sfe than the average .",
    "the western loop coincides with the molecular ring we have mapped from the bima plus the nrao 12 m full - synthesis co image , which was completely absent from the old ovro co map ( stanford 1990 ) , and was only partially revealed in the new ovro co map ( wilson 2000 ) .",
    "it appears that the starbursts occur at a moderate level in the southeast side of the overlap region , proceed progressively with increased intensity towards northwest across over the overlapping molecular concentrations , and produce the most vigorous starburst in the northern and western edges of the huge molecular gas agglomerations in the overlap interaction zone ( fig .",
    "moderate [ c  @xmath120 emission is also detected in the western loop ( nikola 1998 ) , which also indicates the moderate star - forming activity there .",
    "this is again consistent with our results obtained from the radio - to - co ratios .",
    "moreover , the [ c  @xmath120 emission peak appears to be slightly offset from our single - dish co peak ( figures  2 & 4f ) , which is resolved into several co peaks by the interferometers .",
    "the strongest [ c  @xmath120 emission seems to be roughly coincident with the sites of the highest sfe , just north of the co peak in the nrao 12 m map .",
    "our single - dish co map also appears to be roughly peaked at same position as that of the kao 60 ( evans 1997 ) , 100 and 160 @xmath11 m maps ( bushouse 1998 ) .",
    "the strongest mir peak in the overlap region that is inconspicuous at optical wavelength ( mirabel 1998 ; xu 2000 ) , however , may correspond only to the southernmost co peak in the overlap ( wilson 2000 ) , which is not one of the strongest starburst sites and has only a moderate sfe  @xmath6 ( figures 6 & 7 ) .",
    "therefore , the strongest peaks of the co , radio continuum , and fir , as well as the mir peaks , are not necessarily the exact sites of the highest sfe , or the most intense starbursts .",
    "the highest radio - to - co ratio peaks , which may reveal the sites of the most vigorous star formation with the highest sfe , and the strongest [ c  @xmath120 emission peaks , which arise mainly from the photodissociation regions , appear to be the best probes of the most intense starbursts , which might be totally obscured in the optical / near - ir and even in the mir regime .      in light of the numerical models for mergers of arp  244 alike ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; barnes 1988 ; mihos 1993",
    "; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 , 1998 ) and the multi - wavelength observations of arp  244 , comparison of the various observations and statistical studies of lig mergers with those models can be fruitful .",
    "we here try to discuss qualitatively the onset of the starbursts , the fate of the starbursts , and the possible ultraluminous extreme starburst phase in arp  244 , utilizing these observational and theoretical results .",
    "rosat high - resolution imager ( hri ) x - ray map ( fabbiano 1997 ) and the high - resolution and high - sensitivity chandra x - ray images from the chandra news release ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2000 ) , after the submission of this paper , show some correspondence with the discrete radio knots .",
    "most soft x - ray emission , however , is from the disks and nuclear regions , rather than from the overlap region , even though several x - ray emission knots exist in the overlap . yet , more soft x - ray structures in regions of the @xmath24 `` hotspots '' are evidently better revealed in the new chandra x - ray images .",
    "both the x - ray and radio continuum show extended morphology ( prominent ring structure ) in the northern galaxy ngc  4038 , though not in ngc  4039 . since supernova remnants",
    "are most likely responsible for the majority of both extended emission , these observations may be used as probes to identify _ past _ active star formation sites . according to the various models ,",
    "the first burst of star formation may have occurred several @xmath18 years ago when the first closest approach of the galaxy pair happened .",
    "many x - ray knots with the radio emission correspondence can be even older , and they are reminiscent of the possible star forming sites in the past , prior to or during the first strongest impact .",
    "overall , these emission could mark roughly the sites of the interaction enhanced large scale star formation across over the pair s disks at the earliest stage of merging .",
    "h@xmath8 emission and young star clusters shown in the hst images ( whitmore 1999 ) indicate that recent vigorous star formation is also proceeding throughout the entire merging disks .",
    "molecular gas concentrations in the overlap may have hidden some extremely young star clusters and hii regions .",
    "nevertheless , these again are the rather _ recent _ large scale bursts of star formation occurring probably right after the genesis of the tidal tails , after the pair s first closest approach .    both the mir and fir observations ( mirabel 1998 ; xu 2000 ; evans 1997 ; bushouse 1998 ) show the strongest peaks in the rather extended overlap region where the bulk of the molecular gas resides .",
    "but the mir and fir emission peaks differ from each other , whereas the fir peaks roughly at same position as that of the co. generally speaking , the overlap region is the _ current _ sites of vigorous star formation or starburst .",
    "yet , the overall starburst level is at most modest .",
    "the strongest starburst sites with sfe comparable to that of ligs / uligs are confined to @xmath125  kpc scale small regions in the overlap , and the global sfe level is about same as those in the milky way disk gmcs . despite some localized starbursts",
    "are still going - on , the recent peak of starburst phase in arp  244 has most likely passed already , and the entire system is currently in a rather quiescent star formation phase .",
    "the radio continuum - to - co ratio map implies low sfe at both nuclei ( fig .",
    "the highest gas concentration in arp  244 revealed by the interferometers is , however , in the northern nuclear region , which has only moderate @xmath124  kpc scale circumnuclear starburst ring , rather than a sub - kpc nuclear starburst .",
    "the highest radio - to - co ratios are the confined bona fide starburst sites ( fig .  6 ) which appear to have some correspondence with the [ c  @xmath120 emission peaks ( nikola 1998 ) .",
    "the co emission peaks in the overlap region appear not to be at the exact locations of the localized starbursts , and the most intense starbursts might not be at an extremely high sfe level as in uligs .",
    "these highest molecular gas concentrations are likely to undergo _ future _ ultraluminous extreme starburst once they all merge together with the nuclear gas concentrations , and collapse into @xmath68  kpc scale in the final coalescence .",
    "although the progenitor galaxies of arp  244 could only have small stellar bulges , the bulges can be built up through merging ( , carlberg 1999 ) in addition to nuclear gas infalls and concentrations .",
    "thus , arp  244 fits most likely between the two extremes modeled by mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) , and more than an order of magnitude enhanced sfe can be achieved in the final merging .    although most ( @xmath126 ) hi gas is distributed in the tidal tails  ( van der hulst 1979",
    "; hibbard 2000 ) , there are still @xmath127 hi in the merging disks , whereas most uligs have little hi left in the merged disks  ( hibbard & yun 1996 , 2000 ; mirabel & sanders 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "most hi in arp  244 is in the southern tail , where we tentatively detected co emission at the tip of the tidal tail , indicating a molecular gas mass of @xmath128   in the tidal dwarf galaxy .",
    "these are additional gas reservoir for _ future _ star formation , especially when the extraordinary hi tails rain back onto the merging disks ( hibbard 1994 ) , converting most hi gas into molecular phase .",
    "our recent hi observations of ngc  6670 suggest that a precursor to arp  244 can be that the hi disks have merged into a huge overlap concentration in the extended hi disks , prior to the merging of the stellar and molecular gas disks  ( wang 2000 ) . in arp  244 , although an anti - correlation between the molecular and atomic gas distributions appears to exist , there is still a significant amount of hi gas in the molecular gas overlap region . whether there was a hi gas overlap formed previously , prior to the merging of the molecular gas disks ,",
    "requires high resolution hi observations and further comparative studies of the multi - wavelength observations , in combination with the numerical modelings , to test .",
    "clearly , understanding of the formation and evolution of the overlap region is the key to ultimately comprehend the entire star formation history of arp  244 .",
    "the formation of the overlap star formation regions , unnecessarily as overwhelmingly dominant as in the case of arp  244 , might be a quite common phenomenon in merging galaxies ( xu 2000 ) .",
    "both the simulations and observations have shown that the gas is being transported into the nuclear regions when a pair of spiral galaxies undergoes through the merging process , in addition to being dragged out into the tidal tails ( , olson & kwan 1990a , b ; noguchi 1991 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; barnes & hernquist 1991 , 1996 ; scoville 1991 ; gao 1999 ; hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) .",
    "yet , models appear to be unable to reveal the early formation of the gas concentration in the overlap region when galaxies are still quite widely separated , like the intermediate merger arp  244 with the molecular gas overlap , where most gas resides , and the early merger ngc  6670 with the atomic gas overlap .",
    "could a significant amount of the atomic gas , especially in the southern progenitor , have ended up in the overlap region in the first place , prior to the formation of the molecular gas overlap , as a result of efficient hi cloud - cloud collisions than the collisions of the gmcs , when the two gas - rich spiral progenitors first collided ? this is because the mean free path of a hi cloud is @xmath129  pc , much smaller than the size of the overlap region , yet the gmcs mean free path is orders of magnitude larger and the chance of gmc collisions in the overlap is extremely small ( jog & solomon 1992 ) .",
    "just like the early merger ngc  6670 , which has the hi gas concentration in the hi disk overlap region formed prior to the merging of the stellar and molecular gas disks ( wang et al .",
    "2000 ) , there might be a similar hi gas overlap formed in arp  244 during its earliest merging stage .",
    "jog & solomon ( 1992 ) argued that a starburst occurs when the preexisting gmcs in the overlap region undergo radiative shock compressions by the preexisting high pressure of the central molecular intercloud medium produced by the heating from the hi cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "if indeed an hi disk - disk overlap region could be formed prior to the merging of the stellar and molecular gas disks , the dominant star formation should not be occurring in the hi gas overlap region , given few gmcs exist in this hi cloud - cloud collision ism during the early stage of merging . instead ,",
    "large - scale star formation and nuclear starbursts induced by the gas inflow are probably at play ( combes 1994 ) .",
    "it is later formation of the molecular gas disk overlap , within this preexisting high pressure overlapping hi gas concentration , when the merging advances into the intermediate stage , that will probably make gmcs in the overlap undergo starburst by the radiative shock compressions ( jog & solomon 1992 ) .",
    "although the soft x - ray emission in the overlap region in arp  244 is neither strong nor extended , as revealed by the rosat hri ( fabbiano 1997 ) , this may be due to the high gas column density in the overlap which absorbs the most extended soft x - ray emission .",
    "the chandra soft x - ray images of much improved sensitivity and resolution do show some extended features in the overlap , which are particularly in good correspondence with the mir `` hotspots '' .",
    "this is in the right track , just as expected from the prediction of the overlap starburst model of jog & solomon ( 1992 ) .",
    "higher energy x - ray imaging that can penetrate through the heavy dust / gas concentration in the overlap , yet still orders of magnitude below the compton - thick limit , and the extinction - corrected soft x - ray images of arp  244 could be the key to further test the overlap overpressure starburst mechanism .    in advance mergers",
    ", the double - nucleus gas disks are already merging with the overlap gas concentrations , with most gas either between ( , ngc  6240 , tacconi 1999 ) or around the double - nucleus ( , arp  220 , downes & solomon ; sakamoto 1999 ) in @xmath73kpc scale , in addition to the nuclear gas concentrations .",
    "thus , a possible merging sequence for a gas - rich pair of spirals may look like the following : from the build - up of the hi gas disk overlap regions ( ngc  6670 ) @xmath130 the sufficient overlap in both stellar and molecular disks ( arp  244 ) @xmath130 the kpc scale merging double - nucleus gas disks , either with a central gas concentration between the nuclei ( ngc  6240 ) , or with an extended gas disk of several kpc surrounding the nuclei ( arp  220 ) . the transformation of the merging phases and the further development of the overlap regions are also accompanied by the change in the dominant sources of the total power output : from large scale star formation within galaxy disks in early mergers @xmath130 the mainly localized starbursting overlap regions between the galaxies in intermediate mergers @xmath130 the extreme starburst in the highly concentrated double - nucleus sub - kpc sources in advanced uligs .    the overpressure starburst mechanism ( jog & solomon 1992 ) is probably happening in intermediate mergers , especially those with the extensive overlap regions like arp  244 .",
    "yet , this mechanism appears to require a sufficient overlap between the gas disks so that the early formation of the gas overlap region is possible .",
    "is this the sole starburst mechanism during the entire merging process when two gas - rich spiral galaxies merge ?",
    "it is likely that different starburst mechanisms play various roles during different merging stages along a merger sequence .",
    "what then are the other triggering mechanisms for the starbursts ?",
    "wilson ( 2000 ) compared their new ovro co map with the @xmath24 mir emission and suggested that molecular cloud collisions may play an important role for the local intense starburst and the strong mir emission . yet , lo ( 2000 ) found no obvious signatures of cloud collisions from analyzing the molecular gas kinematics in the bima + the nrao 12 m full - synthesis co data .",
    "perhaps arp  244 is on its way of changing from the overpressure overlap starburst to the direct cloud - cloud collision starburst .",
    "an extensive active star forming molecular gas overlap region observed in arp  244 may not always be the case for most mergers .",
    "in fact , most ligs do not show such an extensive molecular gas overlap region ( , gao 1997 , 1999 ; bryant & scoville 1999 ) .",
    "even though star formation in the overlap can be common in mergers , the overlap starburst is probably much less dramatic than that of arp  244 in most cases ( , xu 2000 ) .",
    "but , do all gas - rich mergers develop such an extensive molecular gas overlap phase during the course of merging ?",
    "we do not have a definite answer . only in late merging stage",
    "have both observations and numerical simulations demonstrated the existence of the highly concentrated molecular gas between the merging nuclei .",
    "also , only in advanced mergers , can the chance of gmc - gmc collisions be much enhanced since almost all the molecular gas ( in both the overlap and the two nuclear gas concentrations ) finally condenses into a kiloparsec scale .",
    "now , the mean free path of gmcs is less than the size scale of the gas concentration region since the volume filling factor of gmcs is ten - fold increased , making even the intercloud medium molecular .",
    "therefore , direct collisions of gmcs could be playing an important role for the enhanced starburst when merging progresses into advanced stage in the final coalescence .",
    "we summarize our main results and present our concluding remarks in the following :    \\1 .",
    "our fully sampled co(1 - 0 ) map ( fwhm@xmath33 ) at half - beam spacing reveals a factor of 5.7 larger total co flux in arp  244 than the previously accepted .",
    "this is mainly due to the enormous co extent of arp  244 , which is much larger than the single pointing @xmath131 beam used in the old observation . in general , single beam observations of merging systems",
    "may well systematically underestimate co content in the cases where the merging systems are much larger than the single beam , unless a map of extensive coverage of the merging systems is made .",
    "most of co emission in arp  244 indeed peaks at the disk overlapping region with a broad velocity spread of 600  .",
    "we obtain a total molecular gas mass of 1.5@xmath132 for arp  244 using a standard co - to - h@xmath60 conversion factor .",
    "hcn(1 - 0 ) emission has been detected in arp  244 .",
    "hcn observations suggest that there is only a small amount of dense molecular gas in arp  244 compared to the total molecular gas content .",
    "the fraction of the dense molecular gas is only comparable to that of normal spiral galaxies and is much lower than that of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ligs / uligs ) .",
    "we detected extended co emission far away ( nearly two full beams ) from the major co concentrations , such as those revealed by the interferometers .",
    "the peak co emission in the overlap region has an average gas surface density near @xmath133  pc@xmath95 over @xmath27  kpc  the scale probed by the @xmath131 beam .",
    "even the resolved interferometry co images only reveal that the highest gas surface density is about 10@xmath134  pc@xmath95 , still order of magnitude lower than that of uligs .",
    "this is consistent with the small fraction of dense gas found from the hcn measurements .",
    "weak co emission from the tidal dwarf galaxy at the tip of the southern tail has also been tentatively detected and the estimated molecular gas mass is possibly larger than @xmath135  .",
    "the excellent correspondence of the radio continuum images with the fir maps is evident in arp  244 , which also implies the tight correlation between the two emission .",
    "we use the high resolution vla 20 cm image to approximately represent the fir emission distribution in arp  244 , and compare with the co images of comparable resolution to estimate the local star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , which is defined as the fir to molecular gas mass ratio , and is now indicated by the radio - to - co ratio .",
    "sfe is low throughout the entire system with a global sfe@xmath136 , just same as that of the galactic disk gmcs .",
    "only some confined regions in the overlap , inconspicuous in optical observations , are the sites of the current powerful starbursts with sfe  @xmath5 , comparable to that of ligs / uligs .",
    "the vla radio continuum images also reveal a very similar morphology as that of the molecular gas distribution .    \\5 .",
    "although some localized starbursts are going on in the confined regions in the overlap , the bulk of the molecular gas is forming into stars with a low sfe , just same as that of normal spiral galaxies .",
    "the large amount of total molecular gas , yet only a small amount of dense molecular gas and a low sfe , revealed from our observations , combined with the theoretical predictions of models of gas - rich mergers , seem to suggest that arp  244 has the ultraluminous extreme starburst potential when merging proceeds into late stage .",
    "arp  244 appears to be a snapshot of an ulig in its early stage of making .",
    "\\6 . multi - wavelength comparison together with numerical models appear to indicate that arp  244 has recently passed the peak of large scale active star formation .",
    "globally , the bulk of the molecular gas in arp  244 is currently not in a starburst phase .",
    "the confined bona fide starburst sites of the highest sfe appear to be offsets from the peaks of the co , radio continuum , fir , and mir emission .",
    "the future ultraluminous extreme starburst phase can possibly be reached once the co concentrations in the overlap merge with the double - nucleus gas concentrations in the final coalescence .",
    "\\7 . in conclusion ,",
    "our newly determined 5.7 times larger total molecular gas mass in the `` antennae '' galaxies lowers the global sfe to be comparable with that of gmcs in the milky way disk . comparing the co images with other observations , including our own vla 20 cm continuum imaging , an overall relatively low molecular gas density and a low sfe across over the bulk of the molecular gas distribution have been revealed , which is in sharp contrast with most ligs / uligs .",
    "the strongest starburst sites are currently confined in small regions heavily obscured in the dusty patches .",
    "we conclude that the large reservoir of molecular gas is the sufficient fuel for arp  244 to ultimately enter an ultraluminous extreme starburst phase as merging proceeds to the advanced stage . the ultraluminous phase is possibly achieved once almost all molecular gas condenses into @xmath73kpc scale , with an order of magnitude increase in the gas surface density and more than ten - fold higher sfe .",

    "<S> we report here a factor of 5.7 higher total co flux in arp  244 ( the `` antennae '' galaxies ) than that previously accepted in the literature ( thus a total molecular gas mass of 1.5@xmath010@xmath1 ) , based on our fully sampled co(1 - 0 ) observations at the nrao 12 m telescope . currently , much of the understanding and modeling of the star formation in arp  244 has been derived from a much lower molecular gas mass . </S>",
    "<S> it is imperative to reconsider all as the high molecular gas mass might provide sufficient fuel for ultraluminous extreme starburst in arp  244 once the merging advances to late stage .    </S>",
    "<S> our observations show that the molecular gas peaks predominately in the disk - disk overlap region between the nuclei , similar to the far - infrared ( fir ) and mid - infrared ( mir ) emission . the bulk of the molecular gas is forming into stars with a normal star formation efficiency ( sfe ) @xmath2 , same as that of giant molecular clouds in the galactic disk . additional supportive evidence is the extremely low fraction of the dense molecular gas in arp  244 , revealed by our detections of the hcn(1 - 0 ) emission , which traces the active star - forming gas at density @xmath3 @xmath4 .    using the high - resolution bima plus the nrao 12 m telescope , full - synthesis co(1 - 0 ) images , and our vla continuum maps at 20 cm </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the local sfe indicated by the ratio map of the radio continuum to co(1 - 0 ) emission , down to kpc scale . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the local sfe stays roughly same over the bulk of the molecular gas distribution . </S>",
    "<S> only some localized regions show the highest radio - to - co ratios that we have identified as the sites of the most intense starbursts with sfe@xmath5 . here </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that the 20 cm emission is a fairly good indicator of star formation down to kpc scale in arp  244 because of the well - known correlation between the fir and the radio continuum emission . </S>",
    "<S> these starburst regions are confined exclusively in the dusty patches seen in the hst optical images near the co and fir peaks where presumably the violent starbursts are heavily obscured . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , recent large - scale star formation is going on throughout the system ( , concentrations of numerous super - star clusters and mir `` hotspots '' ) , yet the measured level is more suggestive of a moderate starburst ( sfe@xmath6 ) or a weak to normal star formation ( sfe@xmath7 ) , not necessarily occurring at the high concentrations of the molecular gas reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the overall starburst from the bulk of the molecular gas is yet to be initiated as most of the gas further condenses into kpc scale in the final coalescence . </S>"
