    "porous materials attract much interest due to their broad range of commercial and scientific applications @xcite .",
    "tailoring of materials with the desired structure , physical , and chemical properties has been mainly an empirical work . however , modeling the effects of growth conditions on those properties may be a useful tool to improve them .",
    "for instance , for applications of porous films of oxides or silicon , the simultaneous regulation of porosity and surface roughness is suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the study of thin porous film ,",
    "the simplest models probably are ballistic deposition ( bd ) @xcite and its extensions @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the surface relaxation processes take place during a short time interval after the aggregation of incident particles ( atoms , molecules , or clusters ) .",
    "changes of growth parameters may lead to drastic changes in the porosity and pore connectivity of the deposits , typically with the porosity decreasing as surface relaxation processes are enhanced @xcite .",
    "compact structures are usually observed in film growth dominated by surface diffusion , particularly if diffusion lengths of adsorbed species are large @xcite . some models with",
    "activated diffusion of adsorbed species may produce porous deposits at low temperatures , but the porosity decreases as the substrate temperature increases @xcite . in experiments and models ,",
    "the formation of larger crystalline grains and smoother film surfaces are also observed as the substrate temperature increases @xcite .",
    "the opposite trend is observed in some systems , such as electrostatic spray deposition of oxides @xcite : transitions from compact to ramified structures occur as the temperature increases .",
    "other physico - chemical parameters are also related to these features , such as the liquid content of the spray droplets .",
    "for instance , solution evaporation and clustering in those droplets before adsorption is suggested to explain the formation of ramified structures @xcite .",
    "however , the results also suggest to investigate whether surface diffusion of adsorbed atoms or molecules may lead to increase of film porosity or roughness .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a model of thin film deposition with no desorption and with temperature activated adatom diffusion that shows this trend at high temperatures .",
    "it is an extension of the clarke - vvedensky ( cv ) model for thin film growth @xcite without the usual solid - on - solid condition and without desorption . for fixed value of binding energies",
    ", there is a ( low temperature ) regime with porosity decreasing with temperature and , above a transition point , a regime with porosity increasing with temperature . in the latter regime",
    ", the deposit has a critical percolation backbone structure , which is reflected in the roughness scaling , and the pore size distribution has a power - law decay related to percolation exponents .",
    "this suggests an alternative interpretation for the increase of porosity in high temperature deposition processes and the possibility of producing critical pore size distributions in a broad range of growth parameters .",

    "there is an external flux of @xmath16 atoms per site per unit time .",
    "the incident atom is adsorbed upon landing above a previously deposited atom or a substrate site .",

    "[ steps ] highlights the adatoms that are allowed to move in a given configuration of the deposit and shows the possible steps of five of them .",
    "the hopping rate ( diffusion coefficient ) @xmath17 of an adatom at a given position depends only on the configuration of the four nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites of this position : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "that rate does not depend on the configuration of the target position ( i. e. the position after the step ) .",
    "its general form is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of occupied nn sites and @xmath24 because nn bonds reduce the adatom mobility . due to",
    "the choice of length unit , @xmath17 is the number of random steps of the adatom per unit time .",
    "conversely , the average time for a step of this adatom is @xmath25    in fig .",
    "[ steps ] , adatoms a and d have @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , adatom c has @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , and adatoms b and e have @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "note that a site of the substrate is included in the neighborhood of e.    the target position of the adatom step is randomly chosen among the nn and the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) sites ; the latter option includes positions @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the target site may be in a height above or below the current level of the adatom .",
    "the step is executed if the target site is empty and if a constraint is satisfied : all adatoms remain connected to the substrate by a set of nn adatoms after the step .",
    "this constraint prevents adatom desorption , which is a reasonable approximation for many vapor growth processes .    in fig .",
    "[ steps ] , the adatoms in black can not move because any step to an empty nn or nnn site would disconnect them or disconnect other adatoms from the substrate .",
    "the other adatoms are mobile , but some steps to nn or nnn sites are not allowed due to the non - desorption condition . fig .",
    "[ steps ] also shows the allowed steps of five labeled adatoms .",
    "the case of adatom b is particularly interesting : if it is removed , a part of the deposit is disconnected , but if it moves down - left , connectivity is restored . for this reason ,",
    "this is the only acceptable step of adatom b.    the diffusion coefficient of an adatom with a single nn is related to the temperature as @xmath36 where @xmath2 is an energy barrier and @xmath37 is a characteristic frequency chosen as @xmath38 .",
    "the reduction factor for additional nn is @xmath39 where @xmath3 is a bond energy .",
    "these rules are the same of the solid - on - solid cv model in square or simple cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the original cv model , here the adatom is also allowed to step to empty nnn sites and the target position may be at any height , which leads to overhang formation .    in the cv model , @xmath2",
    "is interpreted as an interaction energy between the adatom and the atomic layers below it , while @xmath3 is the interaction energy with in - plane ( lateral ) neighbors .",
    "our model allows the formation of surface overhangs and pores , thus many adatoms do not have atomic layers below them ; this is the case of adatoms a , c , and d in fig .",
    "[ steps ] .",
    "for this reason , here @xmath2 is interpreted as a result of interactions of the adatom with a large surrounding region , possibly including distant neighbors . on the other hand , @xmath3 is still interpreted as a binding energy per additional nn .",
    "this justifies the use of different values for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , similarly to the cv model @xcite .",
    "the relative effects of diffusion and deposition are represented by the ratio @xmath40 thus , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are taken as the model parameters for our simulations .",
    "simulations of the model with large values of @xmath0 ( of order @xmath41 or more ) are usual in submonolayer growth studies @xcite , but demand long simulation times .",
    "the process of checking the connectivity of a deposit also consumes much computational time because it requires searching for possible isolated clusters @xcite after the random step of an adatom . moreover , the time for this checking increases with film thickness .    for those reasons ,",
    "our simulations were restricted to two dimensions and relatively low values of @xmath0 , ranging from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "the values of @xmath1 were chosen in the range from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , which is sufficient to identify a transition in the porosity scaling .",
    "for @xmath0 ranging from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , the lateral size of the deposits and the number of deposited layers is @xmath48 . for the largest value @xmath49 ,",
    "the lateral size remains the same but the number of deposited layers is @xmath50 .",
    "due to the formation of pores , the average film height may significantly exceed the number of deposited layers , particularly for large values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the porosity @xmath51 is calculated in the middle of the deposits , with heights varying from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the average height of the outer surface ( highest particles in each substrate column ) .",
    "@xmath51 is defined as the ratio between the number of empty lattice sites and the total number of sites in the scanned region .",
    "the choice of the boundary of this region is suitable to eliminate effects of the substrate and not to reach the outer surface ( note , for instance , that the roughness of the samples is always below @xmath46 lattice units ) .",
    "this procedure parallels that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for measuring porosity is ballistic - like deposits , which consists in selecting only points below the deepest through of the samples .",
    "the surface roughness of the deposits was also measured . in a deposit with overhangs ,",
    "the height of a given column is defined as the height of the topmost particle at that column .",
    "this set of heights defines the outer surface of the deposit . for calculating the local roughness , a square box of",
    "lateral size @xmath55 glides along the film surface and , at each position , the root - mean - square ( rms ) height fluctuation of columns inside the box is calculated .",
    "the average rms fluctuation among all box positions and among different configurations of the deposit at time @xmath56 is the local roughness @xmath57 .",
    "the global roughness @xmath58 is measured in the full system size @xmath12 , i. e. @xmath59 .",
    "fig . [ depr10 ] shows deposits grown with @xmath60 and several values of @xmath1 .",
    "their porosity slowly increases with @xmath1 , from @xmath61 for @xmath62 to @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "this value of @xmath0 is typical of very low temperature or very large surface energy ( @xmath2 ) , leading to a very low adatom mobility in the time scale of deposition of an atomic layer .",
    "increasing @xmath1 does not compensate this overall low mobility .",
    "[ depr10000 ] shows very different features in deposits grown with @xmath49 : the porosity is negligible for small @xmath1 ( smaller than @xmath65 ) , but reaches @xmath66 for @xmath67 .    for low @xmath1 ( low nn binding energy )",
    ", @xmath49 provides large diffusion lengths for the adatoms with a small number of nn .",
    "thus , they tend to aggregate in positions with large numbers of nns , in which the small @xmath1 value warrants a long residence time .",
    "this explains the formation of compact deposits .",
    "however , for @xmath68 or larger , the stability of positions with many nns disappears .",
    "all adatoms can easily move , forming overhangs and pores , with connectivity preserved by constraint on allowed steps .",
    "the porosity of deposits for several values of @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ pversusepsilon ] as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "it indicates the presence of a dynamic transition in the large @xmath0 limit : vanishingly small porosity for @xmath69 and finite porosity for @xmath70 .",

    "this value of @xmath72 is large , thus the corresponding binding energy @xmath3 is of the same order of thermal energy fluctuations . in terms of that energy ,",
    "the transition temperature is estimated as @xmath73 this reminds the large roughening temperatures of thermal equilibrium roughening ( of the same order of melting temperatures ) @xcite .",
    "the above discussion considers @xmath0 and @xmath1 as independent parameters .",

    "@xcite , the activation energy @xmath90 and maximal temperature @xmath91 give maximal values of @xmath1 of order @xmath92 , which is in the low temperature regime , even in a triangular lattice structure .",

    "@xcite showed formation of compact branches in the high temperature growth of some samples , but this was an effect of a particular lattice structure that suppressed some atomic steps , leading to an unstable growth .",
    "similar mechanisms are not present in our model .",
    "the nontrivial result of this model is the porosity increase with the temperature for @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , which was not shown in previous works . in the transition point",
    ", @xmath1 is not very small , thus the hopping rates have a relatively weak dependence on the number of nn .",
    "this leads to a high disorder in the distribution of adatom position , subject to the constraint of the deposit being connected .",
    "this interpretation antecipates the relation with random percolation , to be discussed in detail in secs .",
    "[ poredistribution ] and [ roughness ] .",
    "fig . [ distbelow ] shows the pore size distributions of deposits grown with large @xmath0 and with @xmath1 well below @xmath72 . for large pore sizes",

    "[ distbelow ] decrease as @xmath1 increases , indicating that the average pore size increased .",
    "[ distabove ] shows the pore size distribution of deposits grown with large @xmath0 and two values of @xmath1 well above @xmath72 .",
    "a power law decay is observed : @xmath95 here , the error bar was obtained by fitting different ranges of the data for both values of @xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "[ distabove ] .",
    "this result contrasts to equilibrium phase transitions @xcite , in which power law decays are present only at the critical point ( or may be observed in a narrow region around the critical point in finite - size samples ) .    in the critical point ,",
    "the rapid adatom dynamics , of diffusive nature , tends to spread atoms upwards , i. e. to the empty region above the outer surface .",
    "this movement is only constrained by the connectivity condition , so that deposited atoms always form a cluster connected to the substrate .",
    "this suggests the structure of a critical percolation cluster .    above the transition point , the adatom dynamics is even faster than that in the critical point .",
    "this favors random adatom distribution and stretches the cluster in the vertical direction under the connectivity constraint .",
    "thus , we understand that the cluster is also set into a critical percolation structure by the dynamics . due to the external adatom flux ,",
    "this dynamics is certainly far from equilibrium .",
    "consequently , its features may differ from those of equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "however , as we explain below , the exponents are related to ( statistical equilibrium ) percolation exponents .",
    "the critical percolation cluster can be divided in two parts : dead ends , which are isolated branches , and the backbone , which is the part that carries stress or current if the borders are mechanically or electrically excited @xcite .",
    "most of the mass of the cluster is in the dead ends .",
    "for this reason , while the fractal dimension of the cluster is @xmath96 in two dimensions , the fractal dimension of the backbone is estimated as @xmath97 @xcite .    the percolation backbone is frequently modelled as a system of links and blobs @xcite .",
    "the number of blobs of size @xmath98 in a box with fixed lateral size is @xmath99 with @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the exponent relating the number of blobs and the system size @xmath12 , and @xmath102 is the correlation length exponent of the problem @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath8 .",
    "the internal pores of the deposit are the pores surrounded by the blobs of this connected cluster .",
    "the blob size @xmath98 is the number of particles ( adatoms in our model ) in the blob perimeter .",
    "the pore size @xmath6 of our model is the area ( number of empty sites ) enclosed by the blob .",
    "self - similarity implies that the large blobs have the same shape of the full backbone .",
    "if the blob occupies a region of linear size @xmath55 , then the area and the perimeter are related as @xmath103 for this reason , one expects the same decay in the distributions ( [ dist ] ) and ( [ nb ] ) , which gives @xmath104    for comparison , fig .",
    "[ distabove ] illustrates a decay with slope @xmath105 .",
    "our estimates of @xmath106 are slightly smaller than this value .",
    "possibly , this is related to the compact regions inside the largest pores , which gives an effective dimension of the area @xmath6 [ eq . ( [ sb ] ) ] closer to @xmath107 ( consequently larger than @xmath11 ) .",
    "it can be easily shown that the increase in this effective dimension leads to effective exponent @xmath106 smaller than the predicted value .    in sec .",
    "[ simulationroughness ] , we will show that the roughness scaling gives additional support to the interpretation that the structure of the deposits above the critical point is dominated by a percolation backbone .",
    "in systems with normal roughening ( in opposition to anomalous roughening @xcite ) , the expected scaling of the local roughness in large substrates is @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the roughness and dynamic exponents , respectively , and @xmath111 is a scaling function . for @xmath112 ( small box sizes )",

    "below the transition point , growth exponents near the vlds values are obtained , but a crossover to long time kpz scaling can not be discarded due to the small excess velocity provided by the formation of some small pores . above the transition point , we obtain a roughness exponent @xmath9 , which is related to the fractal structure of the percolation backbone .    most of the results presented here are also expected if three - dimensional deposits are grown with this model .",
    "first , the transition in porosity is related only to the change in the mobility of adatoms with two or more neighbors .",
    "second , the structure of the deposits at and above the transition point is also expected to be of a percolation backbone because this feature is related to the connectivity constraint and to the large adatom mobility .",
    "third , the kinetic roughening of the outer surface will follow the same trend : below the transition point , vlds scaling is also expected for the cv model in @xmath169 dimensions @xcite , with a possible crossover to kpz due to pore formation ; above the critical point , the roughness exponent is also expected to be related to the percolation cluster structure . on the other hand ,",
    "the pore size distribution may change drastically in @xmath169 dimensions because the density of the deposits will be much smaller and the pore space will probably be infinitely connected ( this is the case , for instance , of ballistic deposits @xcite ) .",
    "our results suggest that adsorbed molecule diffusion may also be considered to explain increase of porosity in thin films , in contrast to the usual expectation that more compact and smoother films are obtained as the temperature increases .",
    "this unusual trend was already observed in electrostatic spray deposition of oxides @xcite , but other mechanisms were considered to explain those features , such as the evaporation of the spray droplets .                                                                                                                                    , @xmath60 ( red squares ; slope @xmath180 ) and @xmath145 ( green triangles ; slope @xmath181 ) ; ( b ) @xmath153 , @xmath60 ( blue crosses ; slope @xmath182 ) and @xmath145 ( black asterisks ; slope @xmath183).,width=377 ]     and @xmath141 ( red triangles ) and @xmath153 ( green squares ) .",
