    "the curvature model of helfrich , polyakov , and kleinert @xcite is well known as a model for describing shapes of membranes and has long been used for understanding the fluctuation of membranes @xcite . from the two - dimensional differential geometrical view point , the curvature hamiltonian is convenient to describe the mechanics of membranes @xcite .    however , the two - dimensional curvature hamiltonian is not always necessary for providing the mechanical strength for the surface .",
    "in fact , it is well known that the cytoskeletal structures or the microtubules maintain shape of biological membranes @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional bending energy can serve as the hamiltonian for a model of membranes .",

    "the size of the sublattice is characterized by the total number @xmath0 of vertices inside a compartment . as a consequence ,",
    "the mechanical strength of the surface varies depending on @xmath0 , because the compartment size is proportional to @xmath0 and because the mechanical strength is given only by the sublattice .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see the dependence of the phase structure on @xmath0 .",
    "the phase structure of the skeleton model is dependent not only on the bending rigidity @xmath1 but also on the size @xmath0 .",
    "the phase structure of compartmentalized models at finite @xmath0 was partly studied as mentioned above @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the models are expected to be in the collapsed phase in the limit of @xmath2 , because there is no source of the mechanical strength for the surface at @xmath2 .",
    "however , the phase structure in the limit of @xmath3 is unknown and yet to be studied . the compartmentalized model in this limit",
    "is governed by one - dimensional bending energy and , for this reason the model is expected be different from the model with the standard two - dimensional bending energy defined on triangulated surfaces without the compartments .    in this letter , we study a triangulated surface model defined by hamiltonian that is a linear combination of the gaussian bond potential and the one - dimensional bending energy .",
    "all the vertices are considered as junctions , which are considered to have a role for binding three one - dimensional chains .",
    "consequently , the model is considered to be a compartmentalized model in the limit of @xmath3 .",

    "the lack of vertex fluctuation is considered to soften the first - order surface fluctuation transition seen in the finite @xmath0 model .",
    "we should note that sufficiently small values of @xmath0 implies that the compartment size is comparable to the bond length scale , which can arbitrarily be fixed due to the scale invariant property of the partition function .",

    "thus , @xmath122 ( smooth phase ) and @xmath123 ( collapsed phase ) were obtained , and then we found that the physical condition @xmath121 is satisfied in the collapsed phase although @xmath124 includes relatively large error .",
    "meshwork models in @xcite has no vertex inside the compartments , which have finite size @xmath0 .",
    "the phase structure of such meshwork model of finite @xmath0 is considered to be dependent on the elasticity of junctions @xcite .",
