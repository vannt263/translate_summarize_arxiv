    "the statistical mechanics of finite - connectivity systems has seen a large increase in interest within the last decade .",
    "the major reason for this interest was the emergence of a close interdisciplinary collaboration between statistical mechanics and theoretical computer science .",
    "in many hard combinatorial problems , phase transitions in resolvability and algorithmic performance were observed  once these problems are suitably randomised @xcite .",
    "this observation obviously provides a large temptation to use statistical mechanics tools to get insight into the problem structure going beyond the one which can be obtained with traditional tools from discrete mathematics and computer science .",
    "the natural mapping of these models to disordered finite - connectivity models was therefore used to investigate problems like satisfiability @xcite , vertex cover @xcite , graph colouring @xcite etc .",
    "coming back to physical models , finite - connectivity systems can be understood as an intermediate step between fully - connected mean - field models @xcite and realistic , finite - dimensional systems . even if their structure is not geometrical in the sense that they are embeddable into any finite - dimensional space , the finite connectivity allows for a reasonable implementation of notations like neighbourhood , distance etc .",
    "this property enables construction and analysis of microscopically motivated models , in particular for spin - glasses @xcite and structural glasses @xcite .",
    "the understanding of these models is , however , mainly based on the analysis of their thermodynamic equilibrium behaviour . due to a technical break - through based on an application of the cavity method to finite - connectivity models @xcite , the structure of stable and metastable states , the appearance of phase transitions etc .",
    "are relatively well - understood by now .",
    "the knowledge is much less evolved in what concerns the dynamics of finite - connectivity models @xcite . here",
    "we will use an approximation scheme first introduced to analyse the dynamical behaviour of stochastic local - search algorithms for combinatorial optimisation @xcite .",
    "we will , however , use a different formulation which is based on the observation from ref .  @xcite that the method can be put into the canonical form of a projective approximations scheme being equivalent to the dynamical replica theory @xcite which was originally developed for fully connected systems . note",
    "also @xcite , where the same method was recently applied to ising models on random graphs .",
    "the model studied here is a hard - sphere lattice - gas model on a generalised bethe lattice , which was first proposed in @xcite as a microscopically motivated , but solvable model for the structural glass transition .",
    "the equilibrium behaviour of this model , including crystallisation as well as glass formation , was studied in great detail in @xcite",
    ". the present work , which is concentrated on the relaxational dynamics of the model , can be seen as a natural continuation of the work presented therein .",
    "even if we have tried to make the present paper as self - contained as possible , sometimes we have to refer to technical details in the previous publication  whose full inclusion would go beyond the scope of the present article .    the paper is organised as follows .",
    "[ sec : model ] gives an introduction to the system including a brief review of its static properties and the definition of the dynamics .",
    "in the following section , the general outline of the applied approximation scheme is presented .",
    "iv is dedicated to crystallisation dynamics , containing two approximations and comparison with monte - carlo simulations . in sec .",
    "v an approximation of the dynamics near the spin - glass transition is presented .",
    "finally , conclusion and outlook are given in the last section .",
    "in a first step , we are going to define the model itself , review its static properties which were analysed in detail in @xcite .",
    "in the second part of this section we will define microscopic physical dynamics for the model , whose analysis will be the subject of the whole paper .",
    "the system is a lattice gas of hard spheres living on a generalised bethe lattice .",
    "let us first specify the character of the particles .",
    "the property of hard spheres is realised by introducing an excluded volume associated with each particle .",
    "this is done by requiring that two neighbouring sites ( i.e. sites that are connected with an edge in the graph ) can not be occupied simultaneously .",
    "two particles have thus a minimal distance of two on the lattice .    the generalised bethe lattice is constructed in the following way : the basic building blocks are small completely connected sub - graphs ( i.e. cliques ) , each of which contains @xmath0 vertices . in each vertex @xmath1 of these cliques",
    "are merged .",
    "this procedure leads to a graph which is locally isomorphic to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_allgbethe ] for one specific choice of @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ". the ideal graph can be thought of as an infinite continuation of the shown structure such that the whole graph remains loop - less apart from the inner - clique loops .",
    "note that the ordinary bethe lattice can be obtained as the special case @xmath4 .",
    "it is furtheron obvious that a close packing on such a lattice consists of a configuration where each clique carries exactly one particle  which , because of the hard - sphere constraint , realises also the maximum particle density that can be found in a single clique .",
    "a treatment of a lattice gas on this graph would , however , lead to subtle questions about the boundary conditions . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "we would face a strange situation where the boundary is infinitely far from a fixed centre , but the number of boundary sites constitute a finite fraction of all sites . as we shall recur to finite lattices when confronting our results with monte - carlo data",
    ", it seems more appropriate to base the calculations on the properties of finite random realisations of the generalised bethe lattice from the beginning , see also the discussion in @xcite .",
    "a finite graph allowing for a close packing as described above can be constructed , e.g. , as a bipartite ( or @xmath5-partite ) graph which possesses one ( or @xmath0 ) close packings .",
    "any given close packing defines two sub - lattices referred to as 0-lattice ( empty sites ) and 1-lattice ( occupied sites ) in the following .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the system can be obtained from a calculation of the grand canonical partition function @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the chemical potential , @xmath8 label the sites and @xmath9 is the set of edges of the graph . the calculation was carried out in detail in @xcite .",
    "one finds that the system has a homogeneous low-@xmath7-phase ( i.e.  both sublattices have same particle densities ) which is referred to as the _ liquid _ phase . in the high-@xmath7-regime",
    "the system can be found in a phase where the 1-lattice has a higher particle density than the 0-lattice .",
    "this phase is called _ crystalline_. in the case @xmath10 there is also an intermediate regime where both liquid and crystalline phases are locally stable , and the phase transition between liquid and crystal is of first order .",
    "this explains the interest of generalising the concept of an ordinary bethe - lattice ( @xmath4 ) which lacks the intermediate phase .",
    "the extension can be motivated physically by the abundance of short loops found in finite dimensional lattices .",
    "they are taken into account at least approximately by the introduction of local cliques .    another possibility to realise",
    "the finite graph is to construct a generalised regular random graph , i.e. a graph that is locally isomorphic to a generalised bethe lattice but contains long loops with a typical length that is logarithmic in @xmath11 .",
    "this setting leads to a qualitatively different high-@xmath7-phase : the graph is , with high probability , no longer compatible with a crystalline close packing .",
    "the statics of the system can be appropriately calculated via the cavity approach , cf .",
    "the scenario for arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath3 is described in @xcite . in the present study we only focus on the case where @xmath4 ( ordinary bethe lattice ) .",
    "the system then displays a liquid low-@xmath7-phase and a continuous transition to an amorphous high-@xmath7 spin - glass phase .",
    "a one - step - replica - symmetry - broken ( 1rsb ) ansatz takes into account the frustration due to odd loops , and gives a lower grand - potential than the liquid solution .",
    "the dynamics of the model is made up by two basic processes : the first one being diffusion of particles on the lattice , the second one particle exchange with an infinite particle bath .",
    "the realisation of these processes is as follows :    * in every time step , a lattice site is selected randomly .",
    "* if the lattice site is occupied , with probability @xmath12 the particle is annihilated ( or , equivalently , transferred to the particle bath ) . with probability @xmath13",
    ", the particle tries to jump to a randomly selected neighbouring lattice site .",
    "this jump is only realisable , if the new lattice site is empty itself , and has no further occupied neighbouring sites .",
    "every other case would either result in two particles on one site , or in two neighbouring particles , which is excluded according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) . *",
    "if the lattice site chosen in the first step is empty , we try to create a new particle with probability @xmath14 .",
    "this trial is successful only if also all neighbouring sites of the selected one are empty .",
    "the monte - carlo ( mc ) dynamics defined in this way approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) if the rates for particle annihilation and particle creation are related by detailed balance : @xmath15 which we assume to be satisfied throughout this paper . besides the fact that the described dynamics can be easily implemented on arbitrary finite lattices or graphs , it can also be understood as a valid microscopic dynamics of the physical model under consideration .",
    "the time unit is one mc sweep ( @xmath16 ) which corresponds to a number @xmath11 of the above trials .",
    "a single trial thus corresponds to @xmath17 , and the time variable becomes continuous in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the dynamics of diluted systems have been described successfully in the past by use of rate equations @xcite .",
    "this method , even if formulated differently in some of these references , has an elegant formalisation as a _ projective approximation scheme _ ( pas ) described in the following steps :    * a set of intensive macroscopic observables @xmath18 is chosen .",
    "typically @xmath18 are densities and we require `` @xmath19 '' , i.e. the set must contain the observables necessary for the discrimination of the different phases at equilibrium ( e.g. the two sublattice densities to describe crystallisation in our model ) . * in a general non - equilibrium situation , the dynamical equations for the observable do not close in the set @xmath18 .",
    "one can , however , approximately close the equations by assuming equilibrium in a generalised ensemble : all microscopic configurations leading to the same values of all observables in @xmath18 are assumed to be equiprobable .",
    "there is , of course , no reason why this closure assumption should be true in general .",
    "it can , however , be seen as the most natural approximation to the actual distribution of the system which is based solely on the knowledge of the observable values , and on no further information . in this sense",
    ", the pas has to be considered a the best possible approximation of the model s dynamics based on @xmath18 .",
    "this does not mean that , for specific initial conditions , parameter values etc . , there can not be a better approximation to the actual time dependence of the observables .",
    "for the general case , it constitutes , however , an optimal use of the available information on the system .",
    "further on , since we required `` @xmath19 '' , we are sure that the true thermal equilibrium is a fixed point of the pas .    technically , the equipartition hypothesis is realised in the following way :    * for each observable in @xmath18 , a conjugate chemical potential is introduced ( e.g. the usual chemical potential @xmath7 would couple to the particle density @xmath20 ) .",
    "the potentials are collected in the vector @xmath21 . *",
    "the generalised grand partition function @xmath22 automatically implements the equipartition condition .",
    "* for given observable values of @xmath18 , the values of the chemical potentials @xmath21 are obtained self - consistently from @xmath23 . * starting from the values of the observables @xmath18 , we derive equations for the time changes @xmath24 .",
    "the latter depend in general on a larger set of observables , whose values are evaluated in the generalised equilibrium ensemble using the previously determined chemical potentials . in the next chapter it will become clear , how this step is realised technically .",
    "this scheme provides a well - defined prescription for the approximation of the dynamics of the system based on the observable set @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately this prescription does not include any intrinsic way of quantifying deviations from equipartition , such that all results based on this scheme have to be cross - checked against numerical simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "it is obvious that going to more detailed observables means to enhance the quality of the approximation , at the cost of introducing a more complex generalised ensemble .",
    "this will be shown in detail for the crystallisation dynamics below in sec .",
    "[ sec : crystal ] .",
    "we mention that the assumption of equipartition of probability was introduced in the context of dynamical replica theory @xcite for fully connected spin - glass models . in this context , the technical treatment of @xmath25 was obtained using the replica trick . in the context of finite - connectivity systems , however , the application of the cavity method will be much more efficient .",
    "as a first application of pas to our model , we are going to study the crystallisation dynamics of the model .",
    "we will show two levels of pas , the first one being the minimal description leading to a correct characterisation of the equilibrium , the second one will include a larger set of observables .",
    "both schemes will be compared to numerical data obtained from mc simulations on large , but finite lattices .",
    "the experience gained in this context will be used in a later section in order to approximate also the dynamics close to the spin - glass transition .",
    "let us start with a minimal set of observables .",
    "as we need an indication whether the system is liquid or crystalline , we obviously need the two sublattice particle densities @xmath26 and @xmath27 that refer to the 0-lattice and 1-lattice respectively .",
    "the normalisation is chosen such that @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the close packing limit @xmath30 . before being able to write any closed dynamical equation for the two sublattice densities",
    ", we have to consider the generalised equilibrium ensemble defined in the last section .",
    "we introduce two chemical potentials @xmath31 and @xmath32 that couple to the particles on the respective sublattice .",
    "the calculation of @xmath33 can be performed analogously to that of the grand partition function @xmath34 using the concept of rooted trees . here",
    "we give only a shortened description of how to do so , for technical details see @xcite .",
    "a rooted tree is obtained from a generalised bethe lattice by choosing a site as the root and removing one of the @xmath1 incident branches .",
    "rooted trees can be iterated according to fig .",
    "[ fig_ocemiter ] where dashed lines depict the edges which are added in one iteration step",
    ". we introduce conditional partition functions @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) for a subtree rooted in a 0/1-site which is fixed to be empty ( resp . occupied ) .",
    "these quantities iterate according to        the stroke labels the partition functions of the resulting large rooted tree .",
    "all 0-rooted trees that enter in the iteration are taken to be identical , the same is assumed for all 1-rooted trees .",
    "when we pass to intensive quantities by introducing local fields @xmath38 , the strokes in eqs .   drop out and the iteration equations reduce to two equations for the local fields @xmath39 which still contain the unknown chemical potentials @xmath40 .",
    "these can be eliminated through the connection of eqs .   with the observables",
    "@xmath41 which is established via the physical partition functions @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ". the latter refer to a site within the generalised bethe lattice ( not the root of a subtree ) , i.e.  they are obtained like the stroked partition functions in eqs .   after the substitution @xmath44 on the r.h.s .",
    "of the equations .",
    "the relations @xmath45 allow to derive two more equations , and we end up with four equations containing the four unknown @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "their solution is straight - forward yielding @xmath46 and @xmath47 we note that eq .",
    "( [ gl_mu01 ] ) is the self - consistency result for the chemical potentials and eq .",
    "[ gl_x01approx ] is the result for the conditional partition functions that are essentially contained in the local fields .",
    "we also mention that by setting @xmath48 the results of the calculation for the statics are recovered , i.e. we have found an `` equilibrium '' treatment for non - equilibrium configurations of @xmath41 that naturally contains the physical equilibrium ensemble as a special case .    in order to derive the approximative differential equations for the time - evolution of @xmath41 , we start with the exact equations for the average change @xmath49 in the number of particles @xmath50 on the respective sublattice . the average is taken over the time @xmath17 where @xmath51 is the overall number of sites and @xmath52 are the numbers of sites belonging to the sublattices",
    "@xmath53 is the time that corresponds to one action of the mc - algorithm that implements the dynamics ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_defdyn ] ) .",
    "the changes @xmath49 are given by rate - equations : @xmath54    the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "corresponds to a loss due to annihilation of a particle .",
    "the three factors mean that the algorithm must choose a site on the lattice in question ( @xmath55 ) which is occupied ( @xmath41 ) and annihilate it ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this contribution is exactly known .",
    "the second term contains the gain due to particle creation . here",
    "@xmath56 denotes the probability that the particle creation is possible without violating the hard - sphere constraint , i.e.  the probability that all neighbours of the selected site on the 0/1-lattice are also empty .",
    "its value in one microscopic ( non - equilibrium ) configuration can not be expressed as a function of the @xmath41-values of this configuration , as it contains information about nearest - neighbour correlations that are not included in the single - site observables @xmath41 .",
    "the third term gives the loss of particles caused by those that jump to the other sublattice whereas the last term contains the gain of particles caused by those that jump from the other sublattice to the sublattice under consideration .",
    "hereby , @xmath57 denotes the probability that a tried move of a particle on the 0/1-lattice to a neighbouring site on the 1/0-lattice is in fact feasible .",

    "for instance , we can calculate @xmath59 similarly we find @xmath60    for the calculation of @xmath61 we must consider that , starting from a 0-site , only @xmath1 of the @xmath62 neighbouring sites belong to the 1-lattice which is taken into account with a factor @xmath63 . furthermore we know that the ending site of the jump is empty as are all other sites in the clique that is shared by starting site and ending site .",
    "the only condition for @xmath61 is that the @xmath64 sites of the @xmath2 other cliques containing the ending site are empty .",
    "these sites are all in the 0-lattice as the ending site is in the 1-lattice .",
    "this leads to @xmath65 and similarly @xmath66            eqs .",
    "constitute what we call the @xmath20-approximation , i.e.  the approximation for the crystallisation dynamics which is derived for a minimal set of observables  @xmath26 and @xmath27  in the context of pas .",

    "results are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : mccrystal ] where the @xmath20-approximation and @xmath71-approximation are compared with mc simulations .",

    "( [ gl_rhoapprox ] ) therefore allows to analyse the stability of the equilibrium solution as well as to determine the equilibration time . to achieve this",
    ", we have to calculate the jacobian of the above system of equations , @xmath72 this matrix has to be evaluated at the stationary point .",
    "let us assume that it has the two eigenvalues @xmath73 and @xmath74 with corresponding eigenvectors @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the time evolution of a small perturbation around the stationary point is then given by @xmath77 with constants @xmath78 and @xmath79 which follow from the initial condition , i.e. from the specific form of the perturbation .",
    "the stationary point is obviously stable if both eigenvalues @xmath73 and @xmath74 are negative . in this case , the equilibration time is given by @xmath80 . if at least one of the eigenvectors is positive , the stationary point is unstable and thus physically irrelevant : any small perturbation having a component in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector carries the system exponentially fast away from the stationary point .          and the eigenvectors are @xmath83 both eigenvectors are negative for low densities , but @xmath74 changes sign at @xmath84 .",
    "this point coincides with the local instability of the liquid state in the statical calculation of @xcite .",

    "the latter is given by @xmath85 .",
