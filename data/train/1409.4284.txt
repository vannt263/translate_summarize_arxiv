    "traditionally , phase transitions have been associated to the equilibrium state of stochastic systems .",
    "the main idea is the following  @xcite . the `` fundamental '' description of a physical system is based on quantum mechanics , but",
    "let us suppose that classical physics is sufficiently accurate .",
    "thus , our system under study is composed by a large number of degrees of freedom , whose evolution is given by an equivalently large set of deterministic differential equations .",
    "we can study small portions of such systems using a molecular dynamics approach .",
    "in general , we are not interested in the characteristics of single trajectories , but rather on the average properties of systems with different initial conditions ( or boundary terms ) : the statistical ensembles .    in many cases   the modes associated to the degrees of freedom can be divided into fast and slow ones .",
    "the fast ones can be approximated by `` noise '' and , upon equilibrium , be termed as `` temperature '' .",
    "the evolution of the slow degrees of freedom ( the dynamics ) becomes thus stochastic . by considering different initial conditions and different realizations of the noise , we can study the ensemble of stochastic trajectories , i.e. , the temporal evolution of a probability distribution of possible states .",
    "let us suppose that the evolution of the system can be approximated by a markovian process .    in closed systems",
    ", supposing that all degrees of freedom are coupled ( and that the dynamics is chaotic ) , we can invoke ergodicity ( at least for a large part of the phase space , in the presence of phase transitions and ergodicity breaking ) and equipartition . looking at a small portion of a closed system ( the canonical ensemble ) , we can thus define the temperature and the thermal equilibrium .",
    "the ergodicity is related to the accessible volume of the phase space and therefore to the boltzmann entropy , defined as the logarithm of this accessible volume . in continuous systems we have to introduce a coarse graining ( invoking quantum mechanics ) of the space , in order to reduce the volume to a number .    in this context",
    ", a phase transition is related to a variation of the accessible volume ( and this to the entropy ) , for instance triggered by the temperature ( that here becomes our control parameter ) . for high temperatures ,",
    "the whole space is accessible . for a given system size , and below a critical temperature",
    ", the phase space is partitioned into `` valleys '' that tend to trap the dynamics for a long period .",
    "the presence of these valleys is put into evidence by choosing one or more suitable observables , function of the slow degrees of freedom : the order parameter(s ) .",
    "supposing that the characteristic permanence time inside a valley grows ( exponentially ) on the size of the system , in the infinite - size limit we have a true partition of the phase space .",
    "according with the initial condition , the dynamics ends into one of the available attractors ( in the case of the deterministic , high - dimensional equations of motion ) or , in the language of markov processes , we can say that the transition matrix is no more irreducible or that the largest eigenvalue ( of value one ) is degenerate .",
    "we can use the same word , `` attractor '' also to characterize the stochastic convergence to different asymptotic probability distributions .",
    "the principle of least information or maximum entropy allows to obtain the equilibrium ( asymptotic ) probability distribution of a closed system , the flat distribution over the available phase space , which is consistent with the ergodic hypothesis . in the canonical ensemble",
    ", this leads to the boltzmann distribution where @xmath0 is the inverse temperature ( in the unit of energy ) , @xmath1 is the set of slow degrees of freedom , and @xmath2 is the related energy ( hamiltonian ) . the quantity @xmath3 ( the partition function ) is the normalization constant by identifying the previous boltzmann entropy with the thermodynamic one , the partition function is linked to the helmotz free energy @xmath4 and by knowing @xmath3 one can obtain the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "unfortunately , computing @xmath3 is hard task .",
    "the partition function owes its name to the fact that if the hamiltonian can be written as a sum of two parts that depend on different variables , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and due to the properties of the exponential function , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , consistently with the extensive property of the free energy",
    ". notice that in reality we still need a small interaction term @xmath9 in order to have the thermal equilibrium ( same temperature ) between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 subsystems .    since the hamiltonian is , for many systems , given by a sum of separate kinetic energies plus a non - separable configurational energy , it is possible in this way to study the kinetic parts separately ( they constitute simple one - variable problems ) .",
    "one is thus left with a difficult configurational problem with a smaller number of degrees of freedom .",
    "phase transition for the ising model in 2d with nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "average magnetization @xmath12 and variance as a function of the rescaled coupling @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "size @xmath15 , @xmath16 , transient @xmath17 . ]",
    "since we are speaking of configurations , let us introduce some notation .",
    "we always represent the configuration using only one index , like @xmath18 .",
    "the connections among sites are defined by the adjacency matrix @xmath19 which takes value 1 is @xmath20 and @xmath21 are connected , and zero otherwise ( one can obviously also introduce the strength of the interactions . for defining lattices ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce also the truth function @xmath22 $ ] , which takes value 1 if @xmath23 is true , and zero otherwise ( similar to the kronecker delta , but more flexible ) , and the boolean functions or ( @xmath24 ) , and ( multiplication ) and xor ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we can start from regular lattices of linear dimension @xmath26 , for instance in 1d with nearest - neighbour interactions , we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 $ ] ( for periodic boundary conditions ) . in 2d @xmath29 and @xmath30 \\vee [ j = ( i \\pm",
    "l ) \\mod l^2]$ ] , and so on . a random network ( erds rnyi )",
    "can be expressed as @xmath31 $ ] where @xmath32 is a random number extracted from a flat distribution @xmath33 ; the indices @xmath20 and @xmath21 indicate that we have to extract a random number for each link . in this way we generate a non - symmetric matrix , for having it symmetric ( without self - interactions ) it is sufficient to generate in this way only the part @xmath34 , and copy the rest @xmath31[i > j ] \\vee a_{ji } [ i < j]$ ] .",
    "the connectivity @xmath35 of a site @xmath20 is the number of link connecting site @xmath20 to other sites ( for non - symmetric matrices one has in- and out - connectivities ) : @xmath36 . for regular lattices",
    "the connectivity is constant , while for random lattices defined above , if @xmath37 , the connectivity is distributed as a gaussian for large @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the neighbourhood of a site @xmath20 is the set of connected sites : @xmath40 ( for symmetric networks ) .",
    "we can now introduce the famous ising model , that is a pure configurational model ( one can think that the kinetic energy has been already partitioned ) . given an adiacency matrix @xmath19 , a coupling @xmath13 and a magnetic field @xmath41 ,",
    "the energy @xmath42 of a spin configuration @xmath18 ( @xmath43 ) is given by    the ising probability distribution is and we can absorb the inverse temperature @xmath44 in the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath41 ( control parameters ) .",
    "the magnetization @xmath45 is defined as it constitutes a suitable observable for this problem , as also its variance . from onsager solution in 2d and zero magnetic field  @xcite , we should observe a phase transition at @xmath46 , with a transition from @xmath47 to @xmath48 and the divergence of its variance , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ising ] for a numerical simulation .      in all soluble systems in statistical mechanics ( including the two - dimensional zero - field ising ) ,",
    "a transformation of variables ( for instance the fourier representation ) or an approximation ( like einstein s solid or the mean - field one ) it has been found , making the system separable . for non - separable problems we have to resort to monte carlo computations .",
    "in some sense , monte carlo computations represent the backward direction of the path followed so far .",
    "we look for a stochastic process that has the equilibrium distribution @xmath49 as the asymptotic one . in so doing , we are free to choose the dynamics , preferably looking for those for which the observables quickly converge to their asymptotic values .",
    "the `` golden rule '' is that of the detailed balance principle ( which is only a sufficient condition ) . given any two configurations @xmath1 and @xmath50 , we just need to choose the corresponding transition probabilities of a markov process such that     where @xmath51 is the conditional probability of getting @xmath52 given @xmath10 , with @xmath53 .",
    "the problem of efficiency is that of choosing @xmath50 giving @xmath1 such that the exploration is ergodic , and we have a fast convergence of observables to their asymptotic values . in order to have that",
    ", the energies of the two configurations can not be too different , and in particular we can not draw @xmath50 at random .",
    "rather , one generally chooses @xmath54 except for a random site @xmath20 .",
    "for instance , in the ising model we can have @xmath55 .",
    "the transition probability is     inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : ising ] ) and simplifying ,    there are many possible recipes , the one that we examine is the _ heat bath _ dynamics , for which the probability that spin @xmath20 takes value @xmath56 is in practice , the markov entry @xmath57 , all other spins remaining the same .",
    "we have described so far the behaviour of the system from a probabilistic point of view , but in practice we have to compute a _",
    "stochastic trajectory _ that depends on a certain number of random numbers .",
    "the algorithm follow these steps , for each time @xmath58 :    1 .   choose a site at random @xmath59 , @xmath60 is a random number from a uniform distribution , and @xmath61 represents the largest integer smaller than @xmath52 .",
    "2 .   compute @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the new value of site @xmath20 is @xmath64 .",
    "so we have a trajectory that depends on the random numbers @xmath65 and @xmath66 . the time dependence of these numbers means that they change whenever @xmath58 does .",
    "actually , we can also think of extracting the whole series of random numbers @xmath67 at beginning , and then perform the simulation using this set of numbers . in this way",
    ", they behave as a _ stochastic field _ that changes at every time , and thus it is evident that the configuration at time @xmath58 is a function of the initial configuration and of the random field notice that we can represent the evolution of the system on a time - space lattice , in which a site @xmath20 at time @xmath58 is located in the node of coordinates @xmath68 ( denoted as transversal and parallel directions with respect to time ) .",
    "each site is connected to its neighbourhood ( for computing @xmath69 and to itself ( for retrieving its old value ) .",
    "the random numbers can be distributed on this lattice . in this view , the stochastic trajectories become deterministic once that we have chosen the stochastic field .    in principle",
    ", we should derive the probability distribution by averaging over the initial configuration @xmath70 and the stochastic field @xmath71 , according with the statistical ensemble we are interested in . in practice , in many cases ( but not always ) for the computation of observables",
    "it is sufficient to perform just one simulation , averaging over time ( after a transient ) , provided that the time is large enough .",
    "the property that time averages are equivalent to ensemble averages is called ergodicity .",
    "the results of a simulation for the ising model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ising ] .    in some cases , the system contains other quenched disorder , for instance if the couplings @xmath72 or the external field @xmath73 depend on site indexes .",
    "again , in principle one should average over the realization of disorder , but in many cases ( not always ) , it is sufficient to perform a single simulation for a large enough system",
    ". this is called the _ self - averaging _ property and in somehow analogous to ergodicity .",
    "we shall see that these properties break at phase transitions .",
    "there is a vast literature about phase transition in equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "we want here just recall some property that can be useful for extending the concept to arbitrary systems , not necessarily in equilibrium .",
    "phase transitions are characterized by a change of the value of some observable in correspondence of a precise value of a control parameter , say the magnetization @xmath74 . in practice",
    "we can say that the dynamics of the system changes its structure in correspondence of a phase transition , for instance the phase space may effectively break in two zones that do not communicate at all .",
    "this is equivalent to say that the system is no more ergodic , and we speak of _ ergodicity breaking_.    however , we have a kind of contradiction here : we chose the monte carlo dynamics to be ergodic ( i.e. , there is a finite probability to go from any configuration to any other one ) , so how can ergodicity breaking occur ?",
    "actually , this breaking only manifests itself in a limiting procedure : for a finite system ( finite @xmath38 ) , and long enough time , all the phase space is visited ( it is finite ) , and therefore the average of observables take a unique value .",
    "however , near the phase transition , the observables ( say , the magnetization in the ising model ) maintain the same value for long periods , with occasional switches from one extreme to another .",
    "so , while its average value has a certain value ( say , zero ) , one never observes such value !",
    "the time that the system spends on one phase become longer as we approach the critical value of the control parameter and ( exponentially ) as we increase the system size .",
    "if we take first the limit of infinite system size and then that of infinite time , we observe the ergodicity breaking . in practice ,",
    "it is sufficient to use a large enough system . in the language of stochastic trajectories",
    ", there are two low - energy valley separated by a high ( energy ) and/or large ( entropy ) barrier . in order to connect the two valleys ,",
    "a path should climb the separating saddle , and the associated probability becomes smaller and smaller with the system size , in the vicinity of the phase transition and above .    in the language of markov processes",
    ", we always have an irreducible transition matrix ( since the dynamics is ergodic ) , but in the previous limit the time - product of matrices ( denoted as @xmath75 ) effectively breaks in two ( or more ) sub - matrices , that do not communicate where the @xmath76 denote the paths that connects the two valleys .",
    "the asymptotic distribution @xmath49 is proportional to the eigenvector of @xmath77 with eigenvalue 1 . at phase transition",
    "this eigenvalue becomes degenerate and we have two or more asymptotic distributions , with different `` basins '' .",
    "we can introduce the correlation function the observables can be defined in terms of the correlation function .    the correlation function is expected to decrease exponentially defining the correlation length @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( with respect to time ) .    at a phase transition ( non - analytical behaviour of some observables like discontinuities , divergence or angular points ) the correlation lengths can stay finite ( first - order phase transitions ) or diverge ( second - order phase transitions ) . in the latter case , where @xmath80 are critical exponents .",
    "also observables like the magnetization exhibit similar scaling behaviour .",
    "this phenomenology extends to systems defined directly by stochastic transition probabilities .",
    "different cellular automata neighbourhood . ]",
    "the path that we have illustrated so far can not be applied to all problems : in many cases we are looking for the asymptotic properties of a system that is just defined in terms of the local transition probabilities , of which probabilistic cellular automata ( pca ) are prototypical examples .",
    "cellular automata are defined as time - dependent models , so one should consider a space - time lattice with asymmetric connections at least in the time direction .",
    "for a site @xmath20 at time @xmath58 , its neighbourhood is a set of other sites at previous time , see for instance fig .",
    "[ fig : neigh ] .",
    "probabilistic cellular automata are markov chains for which the matrix elements are given by product of local transition probabilities ( generally uniform ) .",

    "the state of the statistical ensemble at time @xmath58 is expressed by a probability distribution @xmath84 , whose temporal evolution is or , in vectorial terms the state of site @xmath20 at time @xmath85 depends on the state of its neighbourhood at time @xmath58 .",
    "the probability that site @xmath20 takes the value @xmath82 at time @xmath85 given its neighbourhood @xmath86 at time @xmath58 is determined by the ( fixed ) local transition probabilities @xmath87    again , we can define stochastic trajectories ( or deterministic trajectories over a stochastic field )    deterministic cellular automaton can be considered as limit cases of pca , where the transition probabilities @xmath88 are either zero or one .",
