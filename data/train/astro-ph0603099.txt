    "the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect , or the inverse - compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by hot electrons , shifts the spectrum of the cmb photons to higher energy when the photons pass through the regions of cosmic hot gas .",
    "it yields a cmb temperature @xmath2 change at frequency @xmath3 given by @xmath4 where the dimensionless compton @xmath5-parameter is @xmath6 where the integral is along the line of sight of @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the galactic latitude and @xmath10 the galactic longitude .",
    "@xmath11 is the cross section of the thomson scattering and @xmath12 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the number density and temperature of hot electrons . since",
    "groups and clusters of galaxies are hosts of hot gas and their distributions are non - gaussian , the sz effect will imprint the non - gaussianity of groups and clusters on the maps of the cmb temperature fluctuations ( cole & kaiser 1988 ) .",
    "since the wmap data became available ( bennett et al 2003a , 2003b ) , many groups have detected the sz effect signals with the cross - correlation between wmap data and galaxy samples .",
    "the x - ray based catalogues of clusters and galaxies , including the northern rosat all sky galaxy cluster survey ( bhringer et al . 2000 ) and the rosat brightest cluster sample ( ebeling et al .",
    "1998 ) are found to be cross - correlated with the wmap maps at the 2 - 5 @xmath15 level ( hernndez - monteagudo and rubio - martn 2004 ) .",
    "the samples of groups and clusters identified from the apm galaxy survey ( maddox et al .",
    "1990 ) , and 2mass ( jarrett et al . 2000 ) show cross correlation with @xmath16 band data of the wmap ( myers et al .",
    "2004).the wmap-2mass correlation is also found by comparing it with model expectation ( afshordi et al .",
    "2004 ) . using a semi - analytic model of the intra - cluster medium , sz signal was detected from 116 low redshift x - ray clusters at @xmath17 level ( afshordi et al .",
    "2005 ) .    on the other hand , the wmap data are found to be gaussian , especially no significant non - gaussian signals have been detected on scales of clusters ( e.g. komatsu et al .",
    "therefore , a problem is whether the positive results of detecting the sz effect with wmap - galaxy cross - correlation is consistent with the negative results of detecting non - gaussian features of the wmap data alone ? in this paper , we try to reconcile the two results .",
    "that is , we want to show that 1 . )",
    "the wmap maps contain sz - effect - induced non - gaussianity ; 2 . )",
    "this non - gaussian signal can not be seen with the wmap maps alone .",
    "we will study the non - gaussianity induced by the sz effect of the galaxy sample listed in the 2mass extended source catalog .",
    "first , the sz effects of 2mass galaxies have been detected at about 3 @xmath15 level with the cross - correlation between the maps of wmap and 2mass ( myers et al .",
    "2004 ; afshordi et al .",
    "second , the non - gaussian features of the 2mass samples have been extensively analyzed ( guo et al . 2004 ) .",
    "it would be helpful to search for the wmap s non - gaussianity induced by the sz effect of 2mass galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the data used for the cross correlation analysis .",
    " 3 analyzes the sz effects of the dwt clusters , which are identified from the 2mass galaxies with the discrete wavelet transfer ( dwt ) decomposition .",
    "the non - gaussianity of wmap induced by the sz effect of the 2mass dwt clusters is analyzed in  4 .",
    "the discussion and conclusion are given in  5 .",
    "some math stuffs with the dwt algorithm are given in appendix .",
    "we use the foreground cleaned wmap maps , @xmath18 , of @xmath16 and @xmath19 bands ( bennett et al .",
    "the contamination of the galactic foreground is reduced by mask @xmath20 ( bennett et al .",
    "these maps were used for producing the wmap first - year power spectrum of cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "the foreground signal , consisting of synchrotron , free - free , and dust emission have been removed .",
    "the frequency of @xmath19 band is 40.7 ghz , and the sz effect is @xmath21 , while the frequency of @xmath16 band is 93.6 ghz , we have @xmath22 . that is , at these two frequencies , the sz signals @xmath23 is less than 0 .",
    "therefore , the sz signals would be survived during the removal of foreground _ emission _ sources .",
    "we use the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc , jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) , which covers almost the entire sky at wavelength between 1 and 2 @xmath24 m .",
    "the condition of selecting galaxies is taken to be @xmath25 , which measures the magnitude inside a elliptical isophote with surface brightness of 20 mag @xmath26 in @xmath27-band .",
    "there are approximately 1.6 million extended objects with @xmath28 .",
    "most of the xsc sources at @xmath29 are galaxies ( @xmath30 ) .",

    "they are identified as non - extended sources including artifacts . moreover , to eliminate duplicate sources and have a uniform sample , we use the following parameters : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    to select the range of @xmath27 , we use the standard @xmath40 test to examine the completeness of the sample",
    ". the number counts can be approximated by a power - law ( afshordi et al .",
    "2004 ) as @xmath41 the xsc sources with @xmath42 and @xmath43 are believed to be galaxies with 99% reliability ( mcintosh et al .",
    "2003 ) . for this sample , the index @xmath44 is found to be @xmath45 . if considering this @xmath44 to be the standard , the completeness of a sample can be estimated by the deviation of @xmath46 from the standard , i.e. @xmath47 where the standard sample is taken to @xmath43 and @xmath48 .",
    "it has been shown by guo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that the completeness @xmath49 is equal to 1 for sample of @xmath50 in the range @xmath51 .",
    "the factor @xmath49 is obviously larger than 1 for sample of @xmath52 when @xmath53 .",
    "this indicates the catalog to be contaminated towards the bright end . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath49 drops below 0.9 when @xmath54 .",
    "thus we use a cut of @xmath55 to ensure our sample to be complete greater than @xmath56 .",
    "this sample contains 987,125 galaxies with median redshift @xmath57 .",
    "it gives a 2-d number density field of galaxies , @xmath58 .      to analyze the cross correlation and non - gaussian signals",
    ", we will use the variable given by the discrete wavelet analysis ( dwt ) decomposition .",
    "that is , statistical properties are measured by dwt mode - mode correlation , and non - gaussianity is detected by high order statistics of the dwt variables . since the dwt mode is localized in phase ( position and scale ) space , and has regular shape , it can also be used for 1 . )",
    "handle the bad pixels in maps ; 2 . )",
    "identify clusters from galaxy map .",
    "since the sz effect is on small scales , one can subject the cmb temperature maps to an equal - area projection by the lambert azimuthal algorithm : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a relative scale factor,@xmath9 is the galactic latitude and @xmath10 is the galactic longitude .",
    "this hemisphere scheme projects the whole sky into two circular plane , northern and southern sky .",
    "2mass galaxies are also described by this format .",
    "we select a square with @xmath61 in the central part of each circular plane .",
    "we have two fields of @xmath62 in northern and southern sky . both the wmap map and 2mass galaxy distribution are fully overlapped with each other .",
    "we will use coordinate @xmath63 to replace @xmath64 below .",
    "the 2-d maps of @xmath65 and @xmath58 will be written as @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the dwt variables are defined as @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are , respectively , the scaling function and wavelet . for our 2-d samples , the dwt variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 describe , respectively , the mean temperature and the mean number density of galaxies in the cell @xmath74 , which has size @xmath75 and at position around @xmath76 $ ] , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be any integral , and @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the dwt index @xmath81 corresponds to an angular scale of @xmath82 .",
    "the angular distance between modes @xmath83 and @xmath84 at scale @xmath81 is given by @xmath85 .",
    "the wavelet variables ( wfcs ) @xmath86 and @xmath87 describe , respectively , the fluctuations of temperature and galaxy density on scale @xmath88 and position @xmath83 . some details of the algorithm with the dwt is given in appendix a.    the 2mass xsc galaxies are resolved to 10@xmath89 .",
    "our analysis of the 2mass sample can reach to angular scale of about 0.01 degree .",
    "however , on scales less than @xmath90 , the wmap data are dominated by noise . in calculating the wmap-2mass cross correlation or wmap s auto - correlation",
    ", we will use only scales of @xmath91 .",
    "since the dwt variable @xmath72 is localized , it can be used to handle the foreground masks .",
    "a standard technique to treat contaminated pixels is zero - padding ( pando & fang 1998 ) .",
    "that is , 1 . )",
    "put zero data at the masked pixels , and 2 . )",
    "off - count the dwt modes ( @xmath92 ) located at the masked pixels .",
    "we test the zero padding by simulation samples generated with code healpix .",
    "the results show the @xmath20 masked samples with zero padding yield the same statistical properties as the original simulated samples , at least , up to the 4@xmath0 order .",
    "we should emphasize that the lambert projection will violate the rotational invariance on the spherical surface .",
    "we will not use the rotational invariance in our analysis .",
    "moreover , we show in appendix b that the lambert projection does not cause false non - gaussian features . that is , if the original map is free from non - gaussian correlations , the projected map is also free from these correlations .",
    "the lambert projection is legitimate for our dwt analysis .",
    "the sz effect is sensitive to hot gas clouds .",
    "if the mass density and temperature of gas are proportional to the number density of galaxies , one can identify hot gas clouds on scale @xmath88 by modes ( @xmath92 ) with the high @xmath93 .",
    "these modes ( @xmath92 ) are called dwt clusters on scale @xmath88 .",
    "the general method of identifying dwt clusters with @xmath93 have been studied with simulation and real samples ( xu et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "it showed that the clusters identified by top @xmath93 statistically are the same as the clusters identified by the friend - of - friend method if the mean size of the friend - of - friend identified clusters is the same as that of dwt clusters .",
    "the scale of dwt variables is well defined , and therefore , it is parameter - free . on the other hand ,",
    "the friend - of - friend algorithm needs the so - called link parameter .",
    "these parameters may introduce uncertainty in the correlation analysis .",
    "moreover , the clusters identified by the friend - of - friend method usually have very irregular shapes ( jing & fang 1994 ) , it is inconvenient to estimate the statistical significance of the cross correlation between cmb maps and galaxy catalog . on the other hand , the variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 are in the same spatial cell of dwt mode , the statistical significance with @xmath93 and @xmath95 is unambiguous .",
    "the dwt scaling functions are orthogonal from each other , different dwt clusters consist of different galaxies .",
    "this is also useful for statistical analysis .",
    "we identified , in this paper , the dwt clusters on @xmath96 , which corresponds to angular scale @xmath97 , or length scale @xmath98 h@xmath99 mpc at the median redshift of the sample , which is the scale of clusters of galaxies .",
    "we selected 500 cells with top @xmath93 , which are the peaks with 6.4@xmath15 and higher , @xmath15 being the variance of the fluctuations of the number density field of galaxies .",
    "the number of galaxies in the top 500 cells is from about 20 to 60 .",
    "although the 500 cells is identified with 2-d sample , they most likely contain projected clusters or groups .",
    "we perform the cross - correlation between the wmap data and the 2mass dwt clusters by @xmath100 where the variable @xmath101 is taken to be 1 for mode ( @xmath102 ) corresponding to a dwt cluster on scale @xmath96 , and @xmath103 , other modes .",
    "the average @xmath104 overs all possible @xmath105 of the sample .",
    "therefore , @xmath106 is an average cmb temperature fluctuations with a distance @xmath105 from dwt clusters on scale @xmath96 .",
    "figure 1 presents the cross correlation @xmath106 of @xmath16 and @xmath19 band maps with the top 500 2mass dwt clusters . for each dwt cluster",
    ", one can have a correlation @xmath107 .",
    "the solid line and error bar in each panel of fig .",
    "1 are , respectively , given by the average and 1-@xmath15 variance of @xmath106 of the considered 500 top dwt clusters .",
    "figure 1 shows anti - correlation of the dwt clusters with @xmath108 at @xmath109 with temperature decrease @xmath110 @xmath24k , or the compton @xmath5-parameter to be @xmath111 .",
    "this result is about the same as that given by 500 2mass galaxy clusters selected by friends - of - friends algorithm ( myers et al .",
    "the frequency - dependence @xmath112 did nt shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is probably because the difference between @xmath113 and @xmath114 is much less than the errors of figure 1 .",
    "we also can see from figure 1 that for @xmath19 band also have a weak anti - correlation at @xmath115 with the level of @xmath116 @xmath24 k. this result indicates that the distribution of hot gas probably is not simply proportional to the number density of optical and infrared galaxies , but is more spread than the distribution of galaxies .",
    "recently , cosmological hydrodynamic simulation shows indeed that the hottest gas generally distributes more spread than galaxies ( he et al .",
    "therefore , it would be reasonable to consider that hot gas is spread in the range of @xmath117 around a dwt clusters .",
    "we did not found significant anti - correlation with the dwt clusters more than top 500 , or on scales larger than @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the 500 top dwt clusters give an estimation of the contamination on the wmap maps induced by the sz effect of 2mass galaxies . on scale of @xmath96 ,",
    "the map has divided into @xmath118 cells .",
    "the 500 @xmath96 dwt clusters do not overlapped from each other , and therefore , there are about @xmath119 area of the temperature maps of the wmap to be contaminated by the 2mass sz effects with the order of @xmath120 @xmath24 k. considering the @xmath19 band signal at @xmath115 , the contaminated area would be about 1% .      if the anti - correlation shown in fig .",
    "1 is due to the sz effect of 2mass clusters , we can mimic a sz - effect - contaminated cmb map by the following mock sample @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the primeval temperature fluctuations , and @xmath123 is due to secondary effects other than the sz effect , such as the isw effect and microwave point sources .",
    "the term @xmath124 of eq.(9 ) is given by eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "we consider only the sz effects caused by hot electron in 2mass galaxies , which are in a small redshift bin around @xmath125 , it is described by surface density @xmath67 . therefore , we rewrite the compton parameter as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the column density of electrons , and @xmath128 is the density - weighted mean of temperature of electrons in the redshift range of 2mass .",
    "generally @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , the thermal sz effect can be estimated as @xmath130 .",
    "if galaxies trace hot baryon gas , we have approximately @xmath131 .",
    "the relation between temperature @xmath2 and mass density @xmath132 actually is complicated , because the cosmic baryon gas is multiple phased ( e.g. he et al .",
    "2004 ) . for a given dark matter ( or baryon",
    "matter ) mass density , the pdf ( probability distribution function ) of the temperature of baryon gas covers a large range from 10@xmath133 to 10@xmath134 k. nevertheless , the relation between the mean temperature and mass density of the gas can be approximated as a polytropic relation @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is about 1.5 ( he et al .",
    "thus , we have @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , to mimic the thermal sz effect , it would be reasonable to assume @xmath138 where @xmath86 and @xmath139 are , respectively , the wavelet variables ( wfcs ) of @xmath140 and @xmath141 [ eq.(7 ) ] . subjecting eq.(10 ) to a wavelet",
    "transform [ eq.(7 ) ] , and considering @xmath142 , we have @xmath143 because @xmath144 and @xmath145 are , respectively , the powers of the fields of cmb temperature fluctuations and sz effect on scale @xmath81 ( fang & feng 2000 ) , the parameter @xmath146 is the ratio between the two powers on scale @xmath81 .",
    "thus , with eq.(9 ) we can construct mock sample of sz - effect - contaminated cmb maps by the following steps .",
    "first , the term @xmath140 in eq.(9 ) is produced by the healpix simulation .",
    "second , the term @xmath147 is given by eq.(10 ) , in which @xmath148 is taken to be the value given by the 2mass map if the position @xmath149 is within the cells of the top 500 clusters , otherwise , @xmath67 is taken to be equal to zero .",
    "we ignore the term @xmath150 .",
    "finally , we estimate @xmath146 by doing cross correlation between the mock sample eq.(9 ) and 2mass dwt clusters .",
    "figure 2 plots @xmath106 vs. @xmath105 for @xmath151 0.1 and 0.2 .",
    "the best fitting to the observed sz temperature change @xmath152 @xmath24k is given by @xmath153 , which is ratio of the powers of sz effect to the cmb fluctuations .",
    "this result is consistent with the estimation given by semi - analytical model and simulation ( e.g. cooray et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this sample is called mock a.    unlike figure 1 , figure 2 does not show the tail of @xmath107 at @xmath154 .",
    "this is because we assume @xmath155 , i.e. no hot gas locates out side of a dwt cluster .",
    "if we assume that hot electron @xmath156 can exist not only at the cells of dwt clusters , but also in their nearby cells , we have sample of mock b. the cross correlation between mock sample b and 2mass dwt clusters are shown in fig.3 , which does show a tail of @xmath106 .",
    "we see that the sample of @xmath157 is also basically the same as observation .",
    "the term @xmath158 of eq.(9 ) comes from the isw and microwave point sources .",
    "the isw effect is mainly from potential with linear evolution .",
    "the isw effect given by nonlinear evolution is very small ( seljak 1996 ; tuluie et al .",
    "one can ignore this effect if we focus on non - gaussian behavior . if a microwave point source is from the 2mass galaxies , their contributions to the sz effect",
    "have already been included in the wmap-2mass cross correlation .",
    "if the microwave sources are not from the 2mass galaxies , they generally are uncorrelated with 2mass distribution @xmath67 , and therefore , the sz signal of the 2mass - wmap cross correlation would not be hurt by this sources .",
    "using the mock samples , we try to estimate which non - gaussian features are detectable with the wmap samples .",
    "effective detectors of non - gaussianity are given by high order auto - correlations and cross - correlations of wavelet variables ( wfcs ) @xmath159 and @xmath141 ( e.g. pando et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ; guo et al . 2004 ; mcewen et al . 2004 ; cruz et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the normalized high order correlation of wavelet variables is defined as @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 can be @xmath86 or @xmath87 . because @xmath163 , the number @xmath164 and @xmath165 of eq.(12 ) should be even integer .",
    "when @xmath166 , @xmath167 is the kurtosis of the field considered .",
    "therefore for a gaussian field , we have @xmath168    in figure 4 , we plots @xmath169 for cmb map @xmath140 produced by the healpix simulation . as expected , this sample is gaussian .      to detect the wmap non - gaussianity given by sz contamination of 2mass galaxies ,",
    "we use the 4@xmath0 order cross - correlation between the cmb maps and 2mass galaxy distribution defined as @xmath174 using eqs.(9 ) and ( 10 ) , we have @xmath175 since there is no correlation between primeval cmb map and galaxies , we have @xmath176 . therefore , the first term on the right hand side of eq.(15 ) is always @xmath177 .",
    "it is irrelevant to the non - gaussian features .",
    "the non - gaussian signal fully comes from the second term on the right hand side of eq.(15 ) .",
    "if the galaxy field is gaussian , we have @xmath178 where we used @xmath157 .",
    "thus , we may expect that the non - gaussian kurtosis of 2mass galaxies shown in figure 5 will induce @xmath179 .",

    "there are positive signals of the 4@xmath0 cross correlation between the wavelet variables of wmap data and 2mass clusters ; 2 . )",
    "the 4@xmath0 cross - correlation is consistent with the estimation of mock samples a and b , and therefore , this non - gaussian feature probably is from the sz effect of 2mass galaxies .",
    "the last problem we should study is whether the sz - effect - caused non - gaussianity can also be seen with the high order auto - correlations of wmap maps.this point can be analyzed with the 4@xmath0 order detector defined as @xmath182 this detector actually is similar to @xmath183 [ eq.(14 ) ] , but instead of @xmath184 by @xmath185 .    using eqs.(9 ) and",
    "( 10 ) , we have @xmath186 comparing eq.(18 ) with eq.(15 ) , it is clear that the non - gaussian term in eq.(15 ) is proportional to @xmath1 , while in eq.(18 ) to @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , the sz signal in @xmath188 is weaker than that in @xmath189 by a factor @xmath1 , which can be as small as @xmath190 if considering mock samples a and b. thus , it is not surprised that this non - gaussianity is undetectable with current cmb maps like wmap .",
    "figure 7 gives @xmath191 vs. @xmath181 for @xmath16 and @xmath19 bands of wmap data , and for mock samples a and b. it shows no significant non - gaussianity .",
    "therefore , the detector of cross correlation @xmath192 is effective to pick up the sz - effect - induced non - gaussianity , while the detector of auto - correlation @xmath193 is not sensitive to that non - gaussinaity .",
    "this result is not limited with the 4@xmath0 order detectors , but it should be a common feature of high order detectors eq.(12 ) . to replace @xmath194 with @xmath195 will lead to a factor @xmath1 in the non - gaussian term , and therefore , the cross - correlation detectors generally are more sensitive to the sz - effect induced non - gaussianity than auto - correlation of cmb maps .",
    "with the dwt clusters of 2mass sample , we confirmed the previous results of the sz effect of 2mass galaxies on the wmap data ( myers et al .",
    "2004 ; afshordi et al .",
    "2004 ) . for the foreground cleaned wmap maps of @xmath16 and @xmath19 bands , there are about 0.4 - 1% area of the maps is contaminated by the sz effect of 2mass dwt clusters with the compton parameter @xmath196 . with mock samples of the 2mass sz effect ,",
    "we show that the non - gaussianity of the 2mass galaxies is imprinted on wmap maps .",
    "this non - gaussianity can be seen with the 4@xmath0 order cross correlation between the wavelet variables of the maps of the wmap data and 2mass clusters .",
    "the intensity of the 4@xmath0 order non - gaussian features is consistent with the estimation given by the mock samples of the sz effect of 2mass galaxies .",
    "we show also that this non - gaussianity can not be seen by the 4@xmath0 and higher order auto - correlation of the wmap maps .",

    "the dwt variable can be applied to find clusters from galaxy samples , to identify the sz effect of the dwt clusters , to detect the non - gaussianity with high order correlation . with this method ,",
    "all statistics are based on the same set of the dwt variables with well defined scale , position and shape of the modes , the relation between the sz effect contamination and non - gaussianity of the cmb maps can be measured without ambiguous parameters",
    ".    we also found , because the ratio between powers of sz maps to the cmb maps generally is much less than 1 , the cross correlation between the wmap map and galaxy distribution would be more effective to pick up non - gaussianity than auto - correlation of the wmap map . due to the limitation of the resolution of wmap data",
