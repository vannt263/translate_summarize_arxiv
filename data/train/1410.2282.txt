    "quantitative finance theory involves two related probability measures : a risk - neutral measure and an objective measure .",
    "the risk - neutral measure determines the prices of assets and options in a financial market .",
    "the risk - neutral measure is distinct from the objective measure , which describes the actual stochastic dynamics of markets .",
    "the conventional belief is that one can not determine an objective measure by observing a risk - neutral measure .",
    "the best known example capturing this belief is the black - scholes model , which says that the drift of a stock under a risk - neutral measure is independent of the drift of the stock under an objective measure .",
    "recently , ross @xcite questioned this belief and argued that it is possible to recover an objective measure from a risk - neutral measure under some circumstances .",
    "his model assumes that there is an underlying process @xmath0 that drives the entire economy with a finite number of states on discrete time @xmath1 this result can be of great interest to finance researchers and investors , and thus it is highly valuable to extend the ross model to a continuous - time setting , which is practical and useful in finance .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility of recovering in a continuous - time setting @xmath3 with a time - homogeneous markov diffusion process @xmath0 with state space @xmath2 in this setting , the risk - neutral measure contains some information about an objective measure . in general",
    ", however , the model unfortunately fails to recover an objective measure from a risk - neutral measure .",
    "a key idea of recovery theory is that the reciprocal of the pricing kernel is expressed in the form @xmath4 for some constant @xmath5 and positive function @xmath6 for example , in the _ consumption - based capital asset model _ in @xcite and @xcite , the pricing kernel is expressed in the above form .",
    "the basis of recovery theory is finding @xmath5 and @xmath6 thus , we obtain the pricing kernel and the relationship between the objective measure and the risk - neutral measure .",
    "we will see that @xmath5 and @xmath7 satisfy the second - order differential equation @xmath8 thus , recovery theory is transformed into a problem of finding a particular solution pair @xmath9 of this particular differential equation with @xmath10 if such a solution pair were unique , then we could successfully recover the objective measure .",
    "unfortunately , this approach categorically fails to achieve recovery because such a solution pair is never unique .",
    "many authors have extended the ross model to a continuous - time setting and have also confronted the non - uniqueness problem . to overcome the non - uniqueness problem",
    ", all authors assumed more conditions onto their models so that the differential equation has a unique solution pair satisfying the conditions .",
    "carr and yu @xcite introduced the notion of long s discovery of the numeraire portfolio to extend the ross model to a continuous - time setting .",
    "they assumed long s portfolio depends on time @xmath11 and the underlying process @xmath12 and then they derived the above differential equation .",
    "carr and yu also assumed that the process @xmath0 is a time - homogeneous markov diffusion on a _ bounded _ interval with regular boundaries at both endpoints .",
    "they also implicitly assumed that @xmath7 is in @xmath13 for some measure @xmath14 to apply the regular sturm - liouville theory , thereby obtaining a unique solution pair satisfying these conditions .",
    "dubynskiy and goldstein @xcite explored markov diffusion models with reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "walden @xcite extended the results of carr and yu to the case that @xmath0 is an _ unbounded _ process .",
    "walden proved that recovery is possible if the process @xmath0 is _ recurrent _ under the objective measure .",
    "in addition , he showed that when recovery is possible in the unbounded case , approximate recovery is possible from observing option prices on a bounded subinterval .",
    "qin and linetsky @xcite proved that recovery is possible if @xmath0 is recurrent and the pricing kernel admits a hansen - scheinkman decomposition .",
    "they also showed that the ross recovery has a close connection with roger s potential approach to the pricing kernel .",
    "borovicka , hansen and scheinkman @xcite showed that the recovery is possible if the process @xmath0 is _ stochastically stable _ under the objective measure .",
    "they also discussed applications of the recovery theory to finance and economics .",
    "the papers of borovicka , hansen and scheinkman @xcite , qin and linetsky @xcite and walden @xcite assumed a common condition on @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , @xmath0 is _ recurrent _ under the objective measure .",
    "the mathematical rationale for this condition is to overcome the non - uniqueness problem of the differential equation . indeed ,",
    "if existent , there is a unique solution pair @xmath9 of the equation satisfying this condition and we will review this condition in section [ sec : recurrent_recovery ] .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the possibility of recovery when the process @xmath0 is _ transient _ under the objective measure .",
    "we explore in this case what information is sufficient to recover .",
    "one of the main contributions is that if @xmath5 is known and if @xmath15 is _ non - attracted _ to the left ( or right ) boundary under the objective measure , then recovery is possible . to achieve this",
    ", we establish a graphical understanding of recovery theory .",
    "this topic is discussed in section [ sec : recurrence_and_transience ] and [ sec : recovery_theory ] . in section [ sec : applications ] , two examples of recovery theory are explored : the cox - ingersoll - ross ( cir ) interest rate model and the black - scholes stock model .",

    "we assume that we can extract theses four functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 from market prices data , thus they are assumed to be known ex ante .",
    "the above martingale assumption is to define a new measure by using the girsanov theorem , for example , in the proof of theorem [ thm : criterion_martingality ] .",

    "the basis of recovery theory is finding the principal pair @xmath9 and then obtaining the objective measure @xmath20 by setting the radon - nikodym derivative @xmath56    one important aspect in implementing the recovery approach is to decide how to choose state variables @xmath57 many processes can serve as a state variable and the choice of a state variable depends on the purpose of use . one way is the short interest rate @xmath58 investors interested in the price of bonds want to find the dynamics of @xmath50 under an objective measure .",
    "plenty of examples with interest rate state variables can be found in @xcite .",
