    "the capture of a neutron by a proton and the subsequent emission of a photon at 2.223 mev has been the object of much interest since the dawn of gamma - ray astrophysics ( fichtel & trombka 1981 ) because it represents a potentially important spectroscopic tool in the investigation of high - energy environments such as solar flares , neutron star surfaces or accretion disks around compact objects .",
    "several studies have been conducted both from theory and observation , realizing that this line is the most promising candidate of all nuclear gamma - ray processes .",
    "solar flares have had the lion s share of works because of the obvious possibilities of detailed investigation : hua & lingenfelter ( 1987 ) ; murphy et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ; share & murphy ( 1995 ) ; ramaty et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; ramaty , mandzhavidze , kozlovzky ( 1996 ) ; and others .",
    "other sources have also been investigated , although no detection has been confirmed and established to date , despite several previous announcements ( jacobson 1982 ; mcconnell et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "on the theoretical front , guessoum & dermer ( 1988 ) conducted a detailed theoretical investigation in the context of compact binary sources , taking cygnus x-1 as a case - study and pointing out the possibility of emission of a very narrow 2.22 mev line from the atmosphere of the companion , while aharonian & sunyaev ( 1984 ) had considered a two - temperature accretion disk and considered the possibility of emission from the disk itself , where the line would be very broad .",
    "bildsten and co - workers considered the possibility of emission at the surface of a neutron star , as a result of bombardment by accreted protons ( bildsten 1991 ; bildsten , salpeter , and wasserman 1993 ) . in the same framework ,",
    "bykov et al . (",
    "1999 ) recently considered the possibility of detecting nuclear gamma - ray lines from accreting objects with integral .",
    "vestrand ( 1989 ) investigated the 2.22 mev emission resulting from very high energy ( e @xmath0 ev ) protons bombarding companion stars of sources such as cyg  x-3 , vel  x-1 , and her  x-1 , and predicted significant fluxes ( @xmath1 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 ) .",
    "finally , guessoum & kazanas ( 1999 ) , interested in lithium production by neutron bombardment of x - ray binary companions atmospheres and using the adaf accretion disk model , estimated the flux of 2.22 mev line emission from a source at about 1 kpc and found it generally very low ( @xmath4 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 ) .    on the observational front ,",
    "extensive searches of the line have been conducted with the data from the solar maximum mission ( harris & share 1991 ) and the comptel instrument of the compton - gro mission ( mcconnell et al .",
    "the latter showed an excess emission at ( l , b ) = 300@xmath5,-30@xmath5 at about 3.7 @xmath6 .",
    "no obvious counterparts ( x - ray binaries or the like ) could be linked to that general direction , although a catalysmic variable has been suggested as a likely candidate for that emission .",
    "van dijk ( 1996 ) has compiled a list of upper - limit 2.22 mev binary - source radiation fluxes based on comptel observations of 27 black - hole candidates .",
    "these upper limits range from 1 to 5 @xmath7 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "the production of neutrons in the accretion disks around the primaries of x - ray binaries is a direct result of the high temperatures that prevail in such environments .",
    "the gravitational attraction , combined with the viscous dissipation , leads to a significant heating of the plasma , particularly its nuclei , resulting in temperatures as high as 10@xmath8 ",
    "10@xmath9 k in the inner regions ( r @xmath10 r@xmath11 , where r@xmath11 = 2gm / c@xmath12 is the schwarzchild radius of the central compact object ) .",
    "simple considerations show that densities of the accretion plasma can range between 10@xmath9 and 10@xmath13 @xmath14 depending on the geometry and the model , which implies substantial nuclear reactions .",
    "since the accreted material is expected to contained he and/or metals ( depending on whether the secondary star s composition is normal or of wolf - rayet type ) , breakup reactions will produce significant amounts of neutrons .",
    "part of the present paper is devoted to computing precisely such amounts under various assumptions : different accretion disk models , different initial compositions of the accreted material , different temperature profiles , etc .",
    "this will be presented in detail in section 2 .",
    "there are several reasons underlying our interest in 2.22 mev emission from the secondary stars of x - ray binaries .",
    "first and foremost , as mentioned above the cgro 2.22 mev map showed that there are real possibilities for the detection of this line , which would consitute the first observation of any nuclear gamma - ray line outside of the solar system , and this prospect is heightened by the upcoming integral mission s order - of - magnitude improvement in both flux sensitivity and energy resolution , which become crucial when most predictions of line fluxes from such sources are at the 10@xmath15 photons @xmath2 s@xmath3 level , that is below the sensitivity of cgro and right at the detection threshold of integral .",
    "secondly , the accretion disk problem remains fully unresolved ( very little progress has been made on the determination of the disk structure , much less the identification of the viscosity mechanism ) , and since our results will show significant differences in fluxes and therefore in the possibility for detection of this line emission , this may constitute further testing of models .",
    "furthermore , we will find that line fluxes depend substantially on the secondary star s characteristics ( elemental composition in particular ) , the eventual detection of such a signal would then also constitute a diagnostic of the x - ray binary s secondary ( e.g. convection and mixing of the gas ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "2 , the treatment of neutron production in the accretion disk ( and its subsequent escape ) is presented for various models ; in sect .",
    "3 , the detailed treatment of neutron propagation , slow - down , and capture in the atmosphere of the secondary is shown ; in sect .",
    "4 we present the results of line fluxes when everything is combined : neutron production and escape from the disk , various interactions and effects ( geometrical as well as physical ) in the atmosphere of the secondary , and finally capture and gamma - ray emission , with star rotation , photon energy shift , etc . ;",
    "in the final section we discuss our results with integral observation prospects in mind and point to future work on the subject .",
    "neutrons are produced by means of nuclear breakup reactions involving hydrogen and helium nuclei .",
    "once produced , the neutrons can escape or carry part of the angular momentum outward by collisions with the infalling nuclei , thereby participating in the viscous dissipation , as they are not affected by the presence of any magnetic fields .",
    "in fact , the escape of the neutrons from the gravitational attraction of the compact object can be computed quite accurately in the assumption of thermal conditions ( aharonian & sunyaev 1984 ; guessoum & kazanas 1990 ) .",
    "so , at least in principle , the calculation of the flux of neutrons irradiating the surface of the companion star is quite feasible . in practice , however , there are a number of factors which intervene and make the task somewhat more complicated : the temperature and density distribution of matter in the accretion disk is model - dependent , the composition and nuclear abundances of the plasma depends on stellar evolution conditions , and cross sections for the various reactions are not always known accurately ( and this depends also on the extent of the nuclear reactions network taken into account in the computation ) .",
    "since the nuclear reactions relevant to our problem and to the production of gamma rays require energies of about 10 mev per nucleus , our interest is limited to the inner regions of the accretion flow , i.e.  regions around the compact object between about 100 schwarzschild radii ) and either the surface of the neutron star or the horizon of the black hole , depending on the nature of the compact object . for general purposes , we assume a mass of @xmath16 for the compact object , unless a specific case is considered .",
    "in this work we consider a number of relatively simple accretion disk models :    * 1 - the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model proposed by narayan and co - workers ( narayan & yi 1994 , chen et al .",
    "1995 , narayan , yi , and mahadevan 1995 , narayan & yi 1995 ) , which has the added appeal that its temperature and density function are very simple and analytical expressions ( yi & narayan 1997 ) : + @xmath17 + where @xmath18 is the dimensionless radial variable @xmath19 ; + @xmath20 + where @xmath21 is the dimensionless mass measured in units of a solar mass ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 is the dimensionless accretion rate measured in units of the eddington accretion rate @xmath24 ( in this work we will consider values of @xmath25 in the range of @xmath26 ",
    "@xmath27 ) , taking @xmath28 ( the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure ) to equal 1/2 ( as in yi and narayan 1997 ) ; the central factor @xmath29 is taken to equal either 0.3 or 0.1 ( following narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "+ furthermore , it must be noted that in this model the value of the electron temperature does not affect our results , which depend mainly on the profile of the ion temperature t@xmath30(r ) . * 2 -",
    "the advection - dominated inflow - outflow solutions proposed by blandford and begelman ( 1998 ) , which consists of a  generalized \" adaf model where only a small fraction of the gas initially supplied ends up falling onto the compact object , and where the energy released is transported radially outward and effectively becomes a wind , driving away the rest of the accreted material .",
    "+ in this family of solutions , a central assumption is the radial dependence of the accretion rate as @xmath31 . in the present work ,",
    "we take the  gasdynamical wind \" ( case iv of blandford & begelman 1998 ) solution , i.e. @xmath32 , which leads to a density function @xmath33 ; more precisely : + @xmath34 + note that this special form of the density function also corresponds to the solution obtained by kazanas , hua , & titarchuk ( 1997 ) in fitting the time lags in similar , compact x - ray accreting sources .",
    "+ another important equation is that of the disk height h ( in units of r@xmath11 ) , which in the particular solution adopted here , is given by : + @xmath35 + also , the radial velocity is + @xmath36 + finally , the ion temperature profile is the same as in adaf . *",
    "3 - the two - temperature shapiro - lightman - eardley ( 1976 ) model , for which the expressions are given by : + @xmath37 + @xmath38 + @xmath39 + @xmath40 + where @xmath41 * 4 - the uniform - temperature model , similar to the one used in the guessoum & kazanas ( 1990 ) neutron - viscosity model , where t@xmath30 is set by a viscosity condition but is taken to be uniform in the disk , and t@xmath42 is chosen arbitrarily ( usually between 0.1 and 0.5 mev ) ; the density is then obtained from an energy balance requirement ( viscous heating of the ions equal to coulomb energy transfer from the ions to the electrons ) . in the guessoum & kazanas model ,",
    "the following relations were derived : + @xmath43 + where @xmath44 is the ion - electron coulomb energy transfer function ( dermer 1986 ) , + and + @xmath45 + where @xmath46 is the mass of the ion .",
    "finally we note that in each case the system is taken to be in steady - state , whereby the accretion and in - fall are constant in time , and thus the neutron production and gamma - ray emission are steady .      assuming an initial composition for the accreting plasma , that is some initial fractions of hydrogen and helium ( 90% h , 10% he in the",
    " normal \" case , and 10% h , 90% he in the  helium - rich case \" , which would correspond to a wolf - rayet secondary star companion ) , we compute the rates of the main nuclear reactions which the ions ( the protons , alphas , @xmath47he and @xmath12h nuclei ) can undergo : @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53    the first two reactions contributing to the destruction of helium ( our source of neutrons ) , and the last four reactions are the actual neutron - producing processes .",
    "we disregard all high - energy neutron - production from proton - proton collisions .",
    "the cross sections are essentially the same as those used in guessoum & kazanas ( 1999 ) , and the reaction rates are calculated through the usual non - relativistic expression for binary processes ( @xmath54 , the averaging here is performed over thermal distributions for the ions ) .",
    "we then let the plasma evolve over the dynamical timescale @xmath55 , with its temperature and density set by the disk structure equations given above for each model , as the material sinks in the gravitational well .",
    "we use a simple numerical scheme of explicit finite - differencing to follow the abundances of the various species ( the neutrons in particular ) .",
    "this calculation is performed for various values of the model parameters : @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; @xmath60 ; etc . note that since we are only interested in neutron production in the disk and not in any radiative processes , the electron temperature t@xmath42 , whenever needed , is taken as a free parameter , usually equal to either 100 or 500 kev .",
    "the escape of the neutrons is handled in the same way as in aharonian & sunyaev ( 1984 ) or guessoum & kazanas ( 1990 ) , that is by computing the fraction of neutrons that have kinetic energies sufficient to overcome the gravitational binding to the compact object : @xmath61 ; this translates into a fraction of escaping neutrons given by eqs .",
    "( 15 ) of guessoum & kazanas ( 1990 ) .",
    "one final important aspect of the neutrons produced is their energy distribution .",
    "this aspect was addressed briefly in guessoum & kazanas ( 1999 ) , where it was concluded that a thermal distribution of the neutrons with a temperature equal to that of the ions in the disk is reasonable .",
    "this point proves to be important not only for the escape fraction , but also for the interaction of those neutrons that reach the secondary star s atmosphere , since their various interactions there depend strongly on their kinetic energies .      before presenting results of neutron production for the various disk models ,",
    "we first show the main characteristics of these models .",
    "figures [ fig : plasma ] show the plasma density n ( in units of 10@xmath62 @xmath63 ) , the ion temperature t@xmath30 ( in units of mev ) , the escape fraction of neutrons f@xmath64 , and the abundance of neutrons achieved in the disk , all as a function of r = r / r@xmath11 , in the adaf , adios , sle , and uniform - t@xmath30 ( 10 and 30 mev ) , respectively , for disks with solar composition ( 90% h and 10% he ) and an accretion rate of @xmath65 m@xmath66/yr ; for adaf , adios , and sle the value of @xmath29 in the figures is 0.1 , and for the uniform - t@xmath30 models the electron - temperature used for the figures is 0.5 mev .    table 1 presents the results of these calculations , showing the rates of neutron production in the adaf - model case for various values of the viscosity parameter @xmath29 and the mass accretion rate @xmath25 ( 1a corresponds to a  normal \" composition ; 1b corresponds to the  helium - rich \" case ) .",
    "all the results shown correspond to @xmath67 and @xmath68 cm , though the actual results are mostly insensitive to the value of the outer radius of the disk , as most of the nuclear reactions and neutron production take place in the inner part ( less than about 10 @xmath69 ) of the accretion flow where the ion temperature is several tens of mev .",
    "table 2 is equivalent to table 1 in the adios model .",
    "table 3 corresponds to the sle model ; tables 4 and 5 correspond to the uniform - t@xmath30 model , with t@xmath30 = 30 mev and t@xmath30 = 10 mev . respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that the resulting neutron fluxes depend strongly on the models considered , but also are quite sensitive to the 3 disk parameters considered , namely @xmath29 , @xmath25 , and the initial composition of the plasma .",

    "the isotopic abundance of these elements are taken from anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "we have disregarded all other elements in the atmosphere .",
    "the distance between the accretion disk and the center of the secondary ( also called separation ) is parametrized by d@xmath70 .",
    "this distance d@xmath70 and the radius of the star determine the fraction of the neutron flux emitted by the accretion disk that irradiates the secondary .",
    "the secondary s mass and radius allow us to calculate the gravitational potential and therefore the fraction of escaping neutrons , which also depends on their energy and direction .",
    "the temperature , the density , and the composition of the atmosphere are parameters for the simulation of neutron tracks in the secondary . the abundance of @xmath47he is a crucial parameter for the intensity of the 2.22 mev line emission since , though it is estimated to be @xmath72 less abundant than h , it has a cross section for neutron capture @xmath73 times that of h. consequently , this isotope is able to remove neutrons from the atmosphere rather efficiently , thereby reducing the rate of their capture by protons .",
    "the density and the composition also determine the mean free path of 2.22 mev photons in the atmosphere .",
    "simulations of neutrons with an energy @xmath74 impinging on the atmosphere at a zenith angle @xmath75 have also been performed . for each assumption of e@xmath76 and @xmath75 ,",
    "a depth distribution of neutron capture by h ( @xmath77 ) and an energy and zenithal distribution of neutrons leaving the atmosphere ( @xmath78 ) are computed .",
    "these distributions are normalized to the number of impinging neutrons .",
    "figure [ fig : dfdz ] shows the depth distribution of the sites of neutron capture by protons for neutrons impinging with an angle of 40 degrees . for neutron energies lower than @xmath79 0.01 mev , the depth distribution of neutron capture sites and the energy and zenithal distribution of neutrons leaving the atmosphere are rather constant ( with respect to energy ) for a given initial zenith angle .",
    "in fact , at these energies , the neutrons are quickly thermalized in the vicinity of the surface and all follow the same thermal diffusion .    depending on their energy and direction , some of the neutrons that are ejected out of the atmosphere",
    "get decelerated gravitationally and fall back onto the secondary s surface ; some of them decay in the process .",
    "this fraction ( @xmath80 ) of neutrons returning to the atmosphere depends on the energy and zenith angle of the impinging neutrons .",
    "indeed , the larger the neutrons energy , the deeper they can go , and the smaller the zenith angle of the impinging neutrons the deeper they will also go . consequently ,",
    "the probability for a neutron to leave the atmosphere decreases with increasing energy and decreasing zenith angle .",
    "the fraction @xmath80 is calculated using equation ( 19 ) of hua & lingenfelter ( 1987 ) , which determines the time required for a neutron to return to the atmosphere as a function of its energy and zenith angle .",
    "this time is used to determine the fraction of neutrons decaying in flight before they return to the atmosphere .",
    "the spectrum of the escaping and returning neutrons has a cut - off value below the escape energy ( @xmath81 ) because even if a neutron has a kinetic energy a little less than the escaping energy , the time spent to return to the atmosphere can be larger than its lifetime .",
    "the angular distribution of the returning neutrons is very close to an isotropic distribution .",
    "simulations have thus been performed to derive the depth distribution of 2.22 mev creation sites ( @xmath82 ) due to returning neutrons .",

    "the total 2.22 mev intensity depends on the direction of observation with respect to the binary system frame .",
    "indeed , the 2.22 mev photons are emitted only from the surface of the secondary that is irradiated by neutrons .",
    "therefore , the observable gamma - ray flux comes only from the fraction of the secondary area that is irradiated by neutrons and is visible for the observer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : draw ] ) .",

    "the energy distribution of neutrons was assumed to be a maxwellian with kt = 10 mev , truncated at 5 mev ( @xmath99 in equation [ eq : p3 ] ) because the gravitationnal potential of the primary compact object retains the neutrons of lower energy ( see sect .",

    "the fraction of escaping 2.22 mev radiation ( @xmath100 ) is defined as the ratio of 2.22 mev photons that reach the secondary star surface ( outward ) without scattering to the total number of incident neutrons .",
    "this fraction is calculated by integrating the angular distribution of escaping 2.22 mev photons ( see equation 4 ) over all the possible angles .",
    "the 2.22 mev photons produced by the returning neutrons are also taken into account .",
    "the fraction @xmath100 depends on the zenith angles and energies of incident neutrons .",
    "it gives an idea of the efficiency of neutrons in producing an observable 2.22 mev line .",
    "figures [ fig : f22 ] show the escaping 2.22 mev fraction for the two models of the secondary star .",
    "the difference in the neutron capture rate between the two models is principally due to the difference in the composition of the atmosphere .",
    "indeed the abundance of @xmath47he in the second model is such that a large fraction of neutrons are captured by this nucleus and thus lost .",
    "consequently , the neutrons capture rate decreases by a factor @xmath79 17 between the two models . in model-2 the 2.22 mev photons are emitted deeper in the atmosphere , and so their shorter mean free path lowers the fraction of escaping photons by a factor 1.5 compared to model-1 . finally , the gravitational escaping energy of neutrons in model-2 is slighty lower than in model-1 , increasing the fraction of escaping neutrons and further reducing the 2.22 mev emissivity in model-2 .",
    "all these effects lead to a decrease of @xmath100 by a factor @xmath79 30 for model-2 with respect to model-1 at low @xmath74 .",
    "the fraction of escaping 2.22 mev photons depends not only on the neutron capture rate but also on the transmission of 2.22 mev photons in the atmosphere . in model-1 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : f22]a ) , where the neutron energy is lower than the escaping energy , the neutrons thermalize quickly and stay in the upper layer of the atmosphere .",
    "if they leave the atmosphere , they can not escape the secondary but a fraction of them decay before returning in the atmosphere .",
    "the fraction of escaping neutrons increases with the zenith angle .",
    "indeed , high - zenith - angle incident neutrons can more easily escape since they scatter close to the surface .",
    "this is not the case for low - zenith - angle incident neutrons that go deeper in the atmosphere : even if they scatter toward the surface , their energies are rarely above the escape value .",
    "this explains why the @xmath100 fraction decreases with increasing zenith angle below 5 mev . above 5 mev ,",
    "neutrons penetrate and are captured deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "the fraction of escaping neutrons is reduced , as well as the transmission of 2.22 mev photons . however , for large zenith angles , the neutron captures happen closer to the surface in zones allowing the 2.22 mev photons to escape more easily from the star .",
    "the variation of the 2.22 mev photon escaping fraction as a function of the angle and the energy of impinging neutrons in model-2 is similar to that in model-1 .",
    "however , a resonance in the elastic scattering of neutrons with @xmath101he at 1.1 mev is at the origin of the drop around 1 mev ( see fig . [",
    "fig : f22]b ) . at this resonance ,",
    "the angular distribution of @xmath101he - scattered neutrons is peaked for backward directions .",
    "consequently , around 1 mev , incident neutrons are more likely to backscatter and to be ejected out of the atmosphere with kinetic energies too high to allow them to return .",
    "this effect reduces the number of mev neutrons that can thermalize and produce 2.2 mev photons , hence the trough seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f22]b .      the distance between the accretion disk ( the source of neutrons ) and the center of the secondary star , and the angles @xmath29 & @xmath90 , which specify the direction of earth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : draw ] ) , are the basic parameters of this calculation . since the binary system is rotating , @xmath29 varies with time and the observed flux becomes periodic .",
    "intensities have been calculated as a function of the direction of emission for different values of the distance between the primary and secondary stars .",
    "assuming parameters of the binary system ( separation and masses ) , it has been possible to derive light curves of the 2.22 mev line emission , depending on @xmath90 .",
    "however , the range of interesting separations is limited since the secondary radius needs to fill its roche lobe in order to allow the accretion of its matter by the compact object . using a study by paczynski ( 1971 ) that calculated the critical radius of a star in a binary system that allows the outward flow of its matter , we estimated the upper limit of the separation to be between 3.5 - 6 r@xmath66 for a secondary star of 1 m@xmath66 ( model-1 ) and 7.5 - 11 r@xmath66 for a secondary star of 10 m@xmath66 ( model-2 ) , providing compact object masses ranging from 3 to 20 m@xmath66 . with this type of close binary systems , the period of rotation is less than a day .    figure [ fig : phaso ]",
    "shows phasograms of the 2.22 mev intensity as a function of the separation for model-1 .",
    "as expected , the intensity is maximum when the neutron - irradiated area of the secondary star atmosphere faces the observer .",
    "the maximum value of the intensity decreases with increasing separation values because the neutrons flux impinging on the atmosphere decreases with increasing distance between the accretion disk and the secondary . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaso ] , the intensity is equal to zero at a phase value of 0.5 only for a separation of 1.5 r@xmath66 , because for this value of @xmath90 the irradiated area is hidden by the star . for larger separations ,",
    "the irradiated area becomes larger and a fraction of this area is always visible by the observer .",
    "the mean and the root - mean - square ( rms ) fluxes are commonly used for the analysis of periodic emissions .",
    "they have been estimated for our 2.22 mev intensity as a function of the separation and the direction of the observer . both the mean and the rms intensities decrease with increasing separation values as a power law with slope around -2 ( between -1.8 and -2.3 ) .",
    "figures [ fig : intens1 ] and [ fig : intens2 ] show the variation of the mean and rms intensities as a function of the binary separation for the two models .",
    "the mean intensity does not vary significantly with the angle of the observer s direction with respect to the binary system plane .",
    "the rms intensity decreases , however , showing a reduction of the modulation of the visible photon flux with increasing @xmath90 .",
    "the modulation obviously disappears for a direction of observation of the binary system perpendicular to the plane of the latter ( @xmath90=90@xmath5 ) .",
    "the flux at 2.22 mev can be derived using the formula :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the rate of neutrons emitted by the accretion disk , @xmath104 is the normalized intensity and @xmath105 the distance of the binary system to the observer in kpc . for model-1 , the flux at 1 kpc is found to be in the range 10@xmath106 ",
    "10@xmath15 photons s@xmath3 @xmath2 depending on the accretion disk model . for model-2",
    ", it is found to be in the range 10@xmath107 to 10@xmath108 photons s@xmath3 @xmath2 depending on the accretion disk model . combining the results of @xmath103 from sect . 2 ( tables 1a , b to 5a , b ) with the calculations in this section , we obtain the final fluxes @xmath109 , which we present succinctly in tables 7 and 8 .",
    "the separations have been chosen to be 2 r@xmath66 and 8 r@xmath66 for model-1 and model-2 respectively , since for these values the mean fluxes do not change significantly with the binary system inclination ( see figs . [",
