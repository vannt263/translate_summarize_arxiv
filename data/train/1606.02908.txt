    "the neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath5 ) decays of atomic nuclei serve as a forceful incentive to constantly drive nuclear - structure calculations toward better performance .",
    "analyses of the potential experimental @xmath5 outcomes in the future require accurate knowledge of the related nuclear matrix elements ( nmes ) in order the obtained data to serve in best possible ways to unravel the fundamental nature and mass of the neutrino @xcite .",
    "it is also tightly connected to the breaking of lepton number asymmetry and has far reaching consequences even on solutions on the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "a host of models , ranging from the interacting shell model ( ism ) to various mean field theories , have been used in the calculations .",
    "the resulting nmes have been analyzed in the review article @xcite .",
    "most of the calculations have been pursued in the framework of the proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( pnqrpa ) @xcite .    in these many calculations",
    "it has been noticed that several aspects of nuclear structure make an impact on the resulting values of the nmes : the chosen valence space and orbital occupancies @xcite , the shell - closure effects @xcite and the deformation @xcite . only lately the important aspect of the effective value of the axial - vector coupling constant",
    "@xmath4 has been addressed within few models like the pnqrpa @xcite , the interacting shell model ( ism ) @xcite and the interacting boson model 2 ( iba-2 ) @xcite .",
    "a particular problem with the pnqrpa calculations , not present in the other calculations , is the unsettled value of the particle - particle interaction parameter @xmath6 describing the strength of the proton - neutron interaction in the @xmath7 channel . since the introduction of this parameter @xcite its values have been tried to fix by the inspection of the measured single - beta - decay rates @xcite or @xmath8-decay rates @xcite .",
    "here we make an attempt to relate the values of @xmath6 to the values of @xmath4 through the data on beta - decay rates associated with the transitions between an even - even and an odd - odd nucleus .",
    "the data on these decays are presented as comparative half - lives ( @xmath3 values ) and comparing them with the corresponding computed ones one can make conclusions about the possible correlations of these two key parameters of calculation . as mathematical aid we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) statistical analysis of 47 isobaric triplets and 28 more extended isobaric chains of nuclei . in the isobaric triplets",
    "there are two beta - decay branches , left and right , between the central and lateral nuclei , and in the extended isobaric chains more complex systems of consecutive central and lateral nuclei can form . to estimate the theoretical uncertainty inherent in the pnqrpa framework",
    "we include the full parametric freedom available .",
    "this means we introduce an uncertainty in the particle - hole interaction parameter @xmath9 .",
    "in addition we treat both @xmath6 and @xmath9 as parameters specific only to a given @xmath0/electron capture ( ec ) or @xmath1 decay transition pair .",
    "this opens up a large parametric freedom that has not been explored before .",
    "our analysis is intended to address the importance of quenching , i.e. the suppression of @xmath4 with respect to its free value @xmath10 .",
    "quenched values as low as @xmath11 have been reported for example in the ibm-2 model @xcite ; because @xmath5 decay depends on @xmath4 as @xmath12 , this could reduce the decay by orders of magnitude , having a serious impact on the observability of @xmath5 decay in experiments .",
    "whether such strong quenching actually applies to @xmath5 is not a question we can answer here , because we touch here on only the @xmath7 multipolarity of the multipole decomposition of a @xmath5 decay nme and because the @xmath5 decay proceeds via a momentum exchange much larger than that of the presently discussed single and two - neutrino double beta decays .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] the basic theoretical framework is briefly reviewed and the model - space aspects and the adjustment of the model parameters are explained . in sec .  [",
    "sec : quenching ] we make a statistical analysis of the effective value of @xmath13 . here",
    "we try to chart the possible effective values of the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath4 in model calculations using the pnqrpa approach , using different methods . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize and draw the conclusions .",
    "we begin by defining the comparative half - lives ( @xmath3 values ) of the @xmath14 gamow  teller transitions that form the basis of the present analysis .",
    "the @xmath3 value is defined as @xcite @xmath15 ) = \\log_{10 } \\left(\\frac{6147}{b_\\text{gt}}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath16 for the @xmath0/ec or @xmath1 type of transitions .",
    "here the half - life @xmath17 has been given in seconds and @xmath18 is the dimensionless leptonic phase space factor associated with the process .",
    "@xmath19 is the spin of the initial ground state and @xmath20 is the gamow - teller nme defined , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "@xmath4 is the weak axial - vector coupling constant , @xmath6 the particle - particle interaction coupling constant and @xmath9 the particle - hole interaction coupling constant as defined , e.g. in refs .",
    "methods of determining the values of these constants are addressed in the next section .",
    "the @xmath8 decay half - life can be compactly written as @xmath21^{-1 } =       g_\\text{a}^4 g_{2\\nu } \\left\\vert m^{(2\\nu)}\\right\\vert^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 stands for the leptonic phase - space factor without including @xmath4 in the way defined in ref .",
    "the initial ground state is denoted by @xmath23 and the final ground state by @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath8 nme @xmath25 can be written as @xmath26 where the quantity @xmath27 is the energy denominator containing the average energy of the @xmath7 states emerging from the pnqrpa calculations in the initial and final even - even nuclei .",
    "the summation is in general over all intermediate @xmath7 states where @xmath28 is the overlap between two such states . we will in general treat the individual matrix elements for the transition between the initial ( final ) state and the virtual intermediate states , @xmath29 as functions of separate sets of @xmath6 and @xmath9 couplings .",
    "while we do not discuss @xmath5 decay in detail in this article , we briefly describe the theoretical calculation of the corresponding half - life to illustrate the similarities and differences to the above processes .",
    "the @xmath5 decay half - life can be written as @xmath30^{-1 } =       g_{\\text{a},0\\nu}^4       \\left(\\frac{\\langle m_\\nu \\rangle}{m_e}\\right)^2        g_{0\\nu } \\left\\vert m^{(0\\nu)}\\right\\vert^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 stands for the leptonic phase - space factor without including @xmath32 and the electron mass @xmath33 in the way defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we denote the effective axial coupling relevant for @xmath5 decay as @xmath32 to emphasise that its value may deviate from the one determined in single beta and @xmath8 decays .",
    "the effective @xmath5 neutrino mass is denoted as @xmath34 .",
    "as before , the initial ground state is denoted by @xmath23 and the final ground state by @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath8 decay and @xmath5 decay half - lives share the same strong dependence on @xmath35 as seen in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2vbb ] ) and ( [ eq:0vbb ] ) .",
    "it is thus an essential first step to study the effective value of @xmath35 in single beta and @xmath8 decays .",
    "these studies tangent only the @xmath7 contribution to the @xmath5 decay whereas it is known that higher multipoles are very important for the @xmath5 decay as well @xcite . some attempts to study these higher multipolarities by way of single beta decays have been made lately @xcite .",
    "it is thus not straightforward to relate the single and @xmath8 decay studies to the value of the @xmath5 nme , especially since the former involve momentum transfers of a few mev and the latter involves a virtual neutrino with a momentum exchange of the order of 100  mev .",
    "this allows the possibility that the effective value of @xmath35 gets momentum dependent @xcite .",
    "related to this , the high momentum exchange in @xmath5 decay makes the higher @xmath36 states contribute appreciably to the decay rate @xcite . for these higher - lying states",
    "the quenching of @xmath35 could be different from the low - lying states discussed in the present work .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in the pnqrpa no closure approximation is imposed in either modes of double beta decay so that the individual contribution from all intermediate states can be accessed in the case of @xmath5 decay , as well .",
    "these intermediate contributions vary strongly from nucleus to nucleus and even some kind of single - state dominance can be observed for some @xmath5 decaying nuclei @xcite . for more details on the theoretical background ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite .    ,",

    "the proton and neutron fermi surfaces are well contained in the model space .",
    "the bonn - a g - matrix has been used as the starting point for the nucleon - nucleon interaction and it has been renormalized in the standard way @xcite : the quasi - particles are treated in the bcs formalism and the pairing matrix elements are scaled by a common strength parameter , separately for protons and neutrons . in practice these factors",
    "are fitted such that the lowest quasi - particle energies obtained from the bcs match the experimentally deduced pairing gaps for protons and neutrons respectively . for closed major shells the pairing strength parameters were taken from the closest even - even neighbor .",
    "the wave functions of the @xmath7 states of the intermediate nuclei have been produced by using the pnqrpa with the particle - hole and particle - particle degrees of freedom @xcite included .",
    "the particle - hole and particle - particle parts of the proton - neutron two - body interaction are separately scaled by the particle - hole ( @xmath9 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath6 ) parameters .",
    "the particle - hole parameter affects the position of the gamow - teller giant resonance ( gtgr ) in the odd - odd nucleus and its value is fixed by the available systematics @xcite on the location of the resonance : @xmath43\\,\\textrm{mev } .\\ ] ] the difference @xmath44 between the gtgr and the ground state of the neighboring even - even reference nucleus thus depends on the proton and neutron numbers @xmath45 of the reference nucleus , as well as on its mass number . in practice ,",
    "both the measured and the computed gtgr have a width and their location are determined by the centroid ( weighted average ) of the strengths associated with the individual @xmath7 states comprising the gtgr . in a pnqrpa calculation",
    "the difference @xmath46 in eq .",
    "gives the empirical location of the centroid of the gtgr which has to be matched by the centroid of the pnqrpa computed strengths of the @xmath7 states presumed to belong to the gtgr .",
    "the computed centroid depends strongly on the value of the @xmath9 parameter and weakly on the choice of the set of @xmath7 states included in the gtgr , the latter introducing an inherent source of error . throughout our calculations",
    "we assume that the value of @xmath9 in a given system is determined with a relative error of 15 % as a source of theoretical uncertainty .",
    "this 15 % error represents a maximum deviation in @xmath9 such that the computed centroid of the gamow - teller giant resonance is not meaninglessly far from its empirical position as given by eq .  .",
    "throughout we denote with @xmath47 the normalized value of the particle - hole parameter with respect to the value determined through the gtgr .",
    "the determination of the values of @xmath6 , together with the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath4 is presented below .    as an example , fig .  [",

    "the @xmath52 and @xmath53 uncertainties due to a variation of the parameter @xmath9 around its value determined by the gtgr are shown using the colored bands .",
    "the dependence of the single beta nmes shows a typical behavior seen in many triplets where one nme increases whereas the other decreases .",
    "this has the effect that the dependence of the product of the nmes on @xmath6 can become rather weak and consequently the value of @xmath4 can be extracted from the product of the @xmath3 values separately .",
    "this behavior is not universal , as exemplified in fig .",

    "as discussed above , we in turn treat the transitions independently , each depending on separate parameters , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this has the immediate effect that the beta decay / ec processes become statistically independent because they now depend on different parameters .",

    "for example , the combination @xmath82 and @xmath83 is allowed by the combined experimental data within @xmath53 .",
    "another consequence of this is that @xmath4 is effectively suppressed compared to the triplet fit because lower values are statistically preferred for small @xmath79 .",

    "the apparent spread among the @xmath6 is large and there is only a tendency of squeezing the range to lower values for increasing @xmath62 .",

    "the fact that the analyses of the @xmath93 decays and the @xmath8 decays give opposite trends is a sign that there are basic differences between the two modes of decay .",
    "one difference is that for the @xmath8 decays more than one low - lying state can contribute and the contribution coming from the first virtual @xmath7 state of the intermediate nucleus does not exhaust the whole @xmath8 nme ( see table  v of ref .",
    "the balance between the first contribution and the rest depends on the value of @xmath6 in a pnqrpa calculation , and the correlations of @xmath4 and @xmath6 are most likely different for the @xmath93 and @xmath8 decays .",
