    "bright qso activity in the optical peaks at around redshift @xmath6=2.5 ( schmidt , schneider & gunn 1994 ; warren , hewett & osmer 1994 ; shaver et al .",
    "1996 ; mcmahon , irwin & hazard 1997 ) .",
    "qsos are believed to be powered by the accretion onto super - massive black holes at the centre of galaxies ( e.g. rees 1984 and references therein ) and a number of authors have linked the changes in qso activity to changes in the fuel supply at the centre of the host galaxies ( cavaliere & szalay 1986 ; wandel 1991 ; small & blandford 1992 ) .",
    "haehnelt & rees ( 1993 ; hr93 henceforth ; see also efstathiou & rees 1988 ) recognized that the peak of qso activity coincides with the time when the first deep potential wells assemble in plausible variants of hierarchical cosmogonies .",
    "the past few years have seen dramatic observational improvements in the detection of galaxies out to @xmath73 , transforming our knowledge of galaxy and star formation in the high redshift universe .",
    "there are also far more extensive data on the demography of supermassive black holes in nearby galaxies , and on low level activity of agn both in the optical and the x - ray bands .",
    "we discuss here some implications for the formation and evolution of active galactic nuclei , attempting to tie these lines of evidence from high and low redshifts together in a consistent model .",
    "steidel and collaborators ( steidel et al . 1992 ; steidel et al . 1995 ; steidel et al . 1996 ; giavalisco et al . 1997 ) have developed a technique for picking out galaxies in the redshift range @xmath8 .",
    "the detected star - forming population at @xmath9 bears a close resemblance to local star - burst galaxies .",
    "the abundance of these objects is found to be roughly half of that of @xmath10 present day galaxies .",
    "there are however * no secure * direct dynamical mass estimates for these lyman - break galaxies . and little is known at present about the the relation of the masses of these objects to the rate of detected star formation .",
    "strong clustering detected in these lyman - break systems at @xmath11 leads to an interpretation of these objects as the potential progenitors of massive galaxies at the present epoch .",
    "several groups have been engaged in the quest for high - redshift quasars .",
    "schmidt , schneider and gunn ( 1994 ) , detected 90 quasars by their lyman-@xmath12 emission from the palomar transit grism survey in the redshift range @xmath13 .",
    "they find that the space density of @xmath14 quasars decreases by a factor of 2.7 per unit redshift beyond @xmath15 .",
    "based on their analysis they conclude that the peak of the co - moving space density distribution of quasars with @xmath14 lies between redshifts @xmath16 .",
    "the observed decline in the qso number density could be either due to the real paucity of high - z qsos or due to obscuration by dust introducing a systematic bias at high redshifts .",
    "in a recent paper , shaver et .",
    "al ( 1996 ) report the results of the parkes survey of a large sample of flat spectrum sources in the radio - waveband ( that is unaffected by dust ) covering roughly 40% of the sky .",
    "they claim that the space - density of radio - loud quasars does indeed decline with redshift at @xmath17 , and argue that the same conclusion probably applies to all quasars .    in what follows",
    ", we explore the link between star - forming galaxies and qsos at high redshift , assuming that both populations trace the mass function of dm haloes . using the press - schechter formalism",
    "we obtain estimates of the space density of dm haloes .",
    "the space density of these star - forming galaxies corresponds to those of haloes with masses of @xmath18 and virial velocities of @xmath19 km s@xmath20 ( see also baugh et al .  1997 ) .",
    "further evidence for masses of this order comes from the strong clustering of these galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "1997 , bagla 1997 , jing & suto 1997 , frenk et al .",
    "1997 , peacock 1997 ) . a reasonable fit to the luminosity function of these objects can be obtained assuming a linear relation between star formation rate and halo mass , i.e. a constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "a weakly non - linear relation is also consistent with the data and would indeed be required to match the shallow slope of the luminosity function at the high luminosity end reported recently by bershady et al .",
    "comparable fits are obtained for the other cdm variants .",
    "note , however , that the observed @xmath21 widths of these galaxies , @xmath22 km s@xmath20 ( pettini et al .",
    "1997 ) , might be in conflict with the virial velocities of @xmath23 km s@xmath20 quoted above .",
    "the space density of optically selected qsos at @xmath243 with @xmath25 is smaller than that of the detected star - forming galaxies by a factor of a few hundred .",
    "as demonstrated by hr93 the well - synchronized evolution of optically selected qsos can be linked to the hierarchical growth of dm haloes on a similar timescale if the duration @xmath26 of the optically bright phase is considerably shorter than the hubble time . for small @xmath27",
    "this comes more and more in line with the predicted space density of dm haloes and that of star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "however , hardly anything is known about the masses of the host objects of optically selected qsos and this still leaves considerable freedom in the exact choice of @xmath26 .",
    "following the approach of hr93 we estimate the formation rate of active black holes by taking the positive term of the time derivative of the halo mass function and a simple parameterization for the black hole formation efficiency .",
    "it is further assumed that active black holes radiate with a light curve of the form , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the ratio of bolometric to eddington luminosity and @xmath30 is the fraction of the bolometric luminosity radiated in the b - band .",
    "we obtain reasonable fits for a wide range of lifetimes and for all the cdm variants if we allow ourselves some freedom in the relation between * halo mass * and * black hole mass*. there are , however , systematic trends : with increasing lifetime the black hole mass has to become a progressively more nonlinear function of the halo mass and the black hole formation efficiency has to decrease in order to match the luminosity function of qsos .",
    "this is due to the fact that qsos are identified with rarer and more massive haloes with increasing lifetime , and these fall on successively steeper portions of the halo mass function . in fig .",
    "1 we plot two specific choices of parameters which we denote as model a and b hereafter ( see haehnelt , natarajan & rees ( 1998 ) for more details ) . in the lower panels a qso lifetime close to the salpeter timescale @xmath31yr and a scaling of black hole mass with halo virial velocity as @xmath32 was assumed ( @xmath33 is the total efficiency for transforming accreted rest mass energy into radiation ) .",
    "a physical motivation for this particular dependence is discussed later .",
    "the upper panel shows the case of a linear relation between the halo and black hole mass advocated by haiman and loeb ( 1997,hl97 ) which requires a qso lifetime of less than @xmath2yr  much shorter than the salpeter time for usually assumed values of @xmath33 . in principle",
    "@xmath34 could also depend on mass or other parameters .",
    "the last few years have seen tremendous progress in establishing the existence of supermassive black holes , there are now a number of excellent cases ( including that of our own galaxy ) where observations strongly imply the presence of a relativistic potential well ( watson & wallin 1994 ; miyoshi et al .  1995 ; genzel et al .",
    "magorrian et al .",
    "( 1997 ; mag97 henceforth ) published a sample of about thirty estimates for the masses of the putative black holes in the bulges of nearby galaxies .",
    "mag97 confirm previous claims of a strong correlation between bulge and black hole mass ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "a linear relation of the form , @xmath35 , was obtained by mag97 as a best fit . however , considering the large scatter a mildly non - linear relation would probably also be consistent with the data",
    ". we would further like to note here that a linear relation between black hole to bulge mass does not necessarily imply a linear relation between black hole and halo mass and as we will argue later a non - linear relation might be more plausible .",
    "fugukita , hogan & peebles ( 1997 ) estimate the total mass density in stellar bulges as @xmath36 and together with the above ratio of black hole to bulge mass we get , @xmath37 considering the complicated selection biases of the mag97 sample , the small sample size and possible systematic errors in the black hole mass estimates this number is still rather uncertain .",
    "van der marel ( 1997 ) e.g. emphasizes the sensitivity of black hole mass estimates to the possible anisotropy of the stellar velocity distribution and argues that the mag97 mass estimates might be systematically too high .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out by phinney ( 1997 ; see also faber et al .  1996 ) @xmath38 exceeds the mass density in black holes needed to explain the blue light of qsos purely by accretion onto super - massive black holes , @xmath39 by a factor of about ten unless the value of @xmath40 is smaller than usually assumed ( soltan 1982 , chokshi & turner 1992 ) . while a few years ago it seemed difficult to discover the total mass in black holes necessary to explain the blue light emitted by qsos at high redshift , black hole detections in nearby galaxies now suggest that accretion onto supermassive black holes may actually be rather inefficient in producing blue light .",
    "there are three options to explain the apparently large value of @xmath41 ( i)@xmath38 is strongly overestimated , or ( ii ) @xmath42 during the optically bright phase is smaller than previously assumed , or ( iii ) supermassive black holes do not gain most of their mass during the optically bright phase .",
    "a plausible solution with @xmath42 significantly smaller than 0.01 is discussed later in this section .",
    "we first explore the third possibility somewhat further .",
    "the typical mass of a black hole at the end of the optically bright phase of duration @xmath26 exceeds that accreted during this phase by a factor @xmath43 .",
    "this factor should be larger than 1 and smaller than @xmath44 and therefore , @xmath45    the question when supermassive black holes gained most of their mass is therefore closely related to @xmath26 and @xmath29 .",
    "for bright quasars , @xmath29 must be @xmath46 ; otherwise excessively massive individual black holes would be required .",
    "furthermore , @xmath29 will always be smaller than unity even if the ratio of the accretion rate to that necessary to sustain the eddington luminosity , @xmath47 , greatly exceeds unity .",
    "this is because a `` trapping surface '' develops at a radius proportional to @xmath47 , within which the radiation advects inwards rather than escapes . in consequence ,",
    "the emission efficiency declines inversely with @xmath47 for @xmath48 ( begelman 1978 ) .",
    "for @xmath49 the possible range for @xmath26 is , @xmath50    if @xmath26 is very short ( as in model b ) and @xmath42 is not significantly smaller than 0.01 it seems inevitable that supermassive black holes have acquired most of their mass _ before _ the optically bright phase .",
    "we would like to point out here that a value of @xmath51 as large or larger than we infer from mag97 is actually needed for short @xmath26 .",
    "for the remainder of this section we assume that @xmath26 is of order the salpeter time .",
    "the ratio of accreted mass to total mass at the end of the optically bright phase is then equal to @xmath52 . if @xmath53 during the optically bright phase ( and if @xmath42 is not significantly smaller than 0.01 ) then the corresponding gain in mass by a factor @xmath54 indicated by mag97 has to occur _ after _ the optically bright phase .",
    "as the accretion should not be optically bright the most plausible options are advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) and dust - obscured accretion ( narayan & yi 1995 , fabian et al .",
    "1997 and earlier references cited therein ) .",
    "adafs require low accretion rate with @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath12 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter .",
    "there is therefore a maximum growth factor for the black hole mass density due to adafs @xmath57 and @xmath58^{0.5}$ ] would be required even if the accretion lasts all the way from @xmath6=3 to @xmath6=0 .    if , however , @xmath59 ( and @xmath60)then the gain in mass by a factor @xmath61 has to occur _ before _ the optically bright phase as in the case of small @xmath26 .",
    "for adafs this would require @xmath62 and is therefore hardly plausible .",
    "in this case dust - obscured accretion would be the only viable option .",
    "two possible accretion histories with a low overall efficiency for producing blue light are sketched in fig .",
    "3 - the solid curves describe an accretion history where most of the mass is accreted during the adaf phase while the dashed curves are for an accretion history where the black hole gains most of its mass during a short - lived early phase with with @xmath63 .",
    "the figure shows mass accretion rate in units of the eddington accretion rate , the mass relative to the final mass and the optical and hard x - ray luminosity .",
    "the accretion rate is constant at the beginning with @xmath48 .",
    "the mass is therefore linearly rising and @xmath47 decreases .",
    "the spectral energy distribution for accretion with @xmath63 is rather uncertain ( as indicated by the three parallel lines for @xmath64 in the two bottom panels ) and should depend on the absorbing column and the dust content of the outer parts of the self - gravitating disc and/or the host galaxy .",
    "the sharp drop of @xmath47 marks the onset of the back - reaction on the accretion flow and either the start or the peak of the optical bright phase ( with a rather inefficient production of hard x - rays ) .",
    "once the accretion rate has fallen below the critical rate for an adaf ( indicated by the dashed lines in the top panel ) the spectral energy distribution will change to one peaked in the hard x - ray waveband .",
    "as pointed out by many authors , the x - ray emission of optically selected qsos is too soft to explain the hard x - ray background .",
    "di matteo & fabian ( 1996 ) and yi & boughn ( 1997 ) argued that the emission from adafs has a spectral shape similar to the hard x - ray background .",
    "fabian et al .  ( 1997 ) suggested that this might also be true for dust - obscured accretion .",
    "it is therefore tempting to link the rather large value of @xmath65 inferred from mag97 to the origin of the hard x - ray background and the recently detected large space density of faint x - ray sources ( almaini et al .",
    "1996 ; hasinger et al .",
    "1997 , schmidt et .",
    "al 1997 , mchardy et al .",
    "1997 , hasinger 1998 ) .",
    "the presence of extremely low - level optical agn activity in a large fraction of galaxies reported by ho , fillipenko & sargent ( 1997 ) would also fit in nicely with such a picture .",
    "the efficiency of adafs is @xmath66 and decreases rapidly for small @xmath12 and small @xmath67 .",
    "if the hard - xray background was produced by adafs onto supermassive black holes in ordinary galaxies this requires a value of @xmath38 as high as we infer from mag97 , a large value of @xmath12 and a value of @xmath47 below but still close to @xmath68 lasting for a hubble time for the majority of supermassive black holes . at faint flux levels and high redshifts",
    "a possible star - burst contribution to the total spectral energy distribution will become more and more important in the optical and probably also the soft x - ray .",
    "it is interesting to note here that the recently detected number counts in the sub - mm wave - band by scuba could be evidence for dust - obscured accreting agn at high redshifts ( blain et al .",
    "1998 ; almaini et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the optical qso luminosity function at @xmath69 can be plausibly matched with the luminosity function of star forming galaxies at the same redshift and the mass function of dm haloes predicted by a range of variants of cdm cosmogonies believed to comply with observational constraints in the low - redshift universe .",
    "this is possible for lifetimes of optically bright qsos anywhere in the range @xmath2 to @xmath70 .",
    "there is a correlation between the lifetime and the required degree of non - linearity in the relation between black hole and halo mass .",
    "the non - linearity has to increase for increasing lifetime .",
    "predicted host halo masses , host galaxy luminosities , and the clustering strength all increase with increasing lifetime and further observations of these offer our best hope of constraining the duration of the optically bright phase of qsos .",
    "the present - day black hole mass density implied by the integrated luminosities of optically bright qso may be significantly smaller than that inferred from recent black hole estimates in nearby galaxies for generally assumed efficiencies for producing blue light .",
    "we have discussed three possibilities for how and when this mass could be accreted in an optically inconspicuous way : ( i ) in the early stages of accretion at rates far above the eddington rate , ( ii ) by accretion where optical emission is obscured by dust , or ( iii ) in the late stages of accretion at a rate below the critical rate for an advection dominated accretion flow with an shakura - sunyaev parameter of @xmath71 .",
