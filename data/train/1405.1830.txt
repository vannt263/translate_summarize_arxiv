    "the idea of a fully background independent formulation of the microscopic structure of quantum space - time has recently found a tentative realisation in the ( tensorial ) group field theory ( gft ) approach to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "two main lines of research converge in this approach : tensor models @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the first , a higher - dimensional generalisation of the matrix models formulation of 2d quantum gravity , provide the combinatorial backbone and several key mathematical tools , the second suggests the needed algebraic data that allow the definition of a hilbert space structure and of richer , more interesting quantum geometric models for 3d and 4d quantum gravity . in these notes , as in our talk at the workshop , we illustrate briefly how this enrichment of tensor models through the input of loop quantum gravity and spin foam models works , focusing in particular on data and tools from non - commutative geometry , and what it leads to , reviewing some recent results .",
    "we thus complement the mostly combinatorial treatment of tensor models and tensorial group field theories provided by prof .",
    "rivasseau at the same workshop @xcite .",
    "tensor models @xcite aim at a definition of quantum gravity in terms of random discrete spaces .",
    "the basic dynamical object is an array of @xmath0 ( complex ) numbers @xmath1 ( for simplicity , we consider @xmath2 ) , where each index takes values in some finite set @xmath3 , which can be depicted as a ( d-1)-simplex . abusing slightly of terminology ( because we do not yet assume any specific transformation property of this object ) , we call it a tensor .",
    "a choice of action functional    @xmath4 where we have separated a quadratic ( kinetic ) part with kernel @xmath5 from the higher order ( interaction ) part with kernel @xmath6 , in the simple case of a single type of interaction , weighted by coupling constant @xmath7 , specifies then the dynamics of the system , and the quantum amplitudes obtained from the perturbative expansion ( in @xmath7 ) of the partition function    @xmath8[d\\bar{t}_{i_1 ... i_d } ] e^{-\\ , s(t,\\bar{t } ) } \\ , = \\ , \\sum_{\\gamma } \\frac{\\lambda^{n_{\\gamma}}}{sym(\\gamma)}\\ , \\mathcal{a}_{\\gamma } \\qquad\\ ] ]    with @xmath9 the number of interaction vertices of the feynman diagram @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the order of its eventual symmetries . obviously , the precise choice of action ( that is , of kinematic and interaction kernels ) specifies the detailed model one is studying and the structure of its feynman diagrams @xmath10 .",
    "the characteristic feature of tensor models ( and of gfts ) is that the interaction kernels are based on a non - local pairing of tensor indices .",
    "models with simplicial interactionslike ( in @xmath12 ) @xmath13 ( and complex conjugate ) , where repeated indices indicate complete summation over the index sets , have feynman diagrams that can be represented by stranded diagrams ( with each strand corresponding to an index of the tensor @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) dual to simplicial complexes , i.e. gluings of d - simplices ( corresponding to interaction kernels , e.g. a tetrahedron in the example ) across shared ( d-1)-simplices .",
    "one can turn @xmath14 into a proper tensor by assuming it transforms under the unitary ( orthogonal , in the real case ) group @xmath16 where each component transforms a given index of the tensor @xmath14 .",
    "a natural set of interaction kernels is then given by polynomial tensor invariants @xmath17 labelled by closed coloured graphs @xmath18 obtained as follows : a ) draw a white ( resp .",
    "black ) vertex for each tensor @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) appearing in the polynomial ; b ) associate @xmath19 different colours the @xmath19 indices of a tensor and draw a coloured link between a black and a white vertex corresponding to the index that is contracted between a tensor @xmath14 and a tensor @xmath15 in the polynomial ( no contraction between two @xmath14 or two @xmath15 is allowed ) .",
    "one can also associate to the coloured graph a triangulation made of a number of ( d-1)-simplices equal to the order of the polynomial , glued along shared ( d-2)-faces according to the pattern of links in the graph , and consider the polynomial to correspond to a d - cell bounded by such triangulation . in this case , the feynman diagrams correspond to cellular complexes made out of glueings of such -d - cells along boundary ( d-1)-simplices . in turn , any such d - cell can be triangulated by inserting a single vertex inside it and connecting this with the boundary vertices ( so that the d - cell is formed by @xmath20 d - simplices glued around such central vertex ) .",
    "the proposed definition of quantum gravity given by tensor models is therefore purely combinatorial : a sum over cellular complexes ( dual to ) @xmath10 weighted by an amplitude @xmath21 that only depends on the combinatorial structure of @xmath10 itself .",
    "one can then endow the cellular complexes with a notion of discrete metric given by the graph distance .",
    "then the sum over cellular complexes admits the interpretation of a sum over discrete geometries and the amplitude @xmath21 can be re - interpreted ( after appropriate re - interpretation of the constants @xmath22 and @xmath7 ) as the exponential of the regge action for the equilateral triangulation corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "we thus have a lattice gravity path integral analogous to the one defining the dynamical triangulations approach to quantum gravity , now generated by the field theory for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    by now , an impressive wealth of mathematical results have accumulated for this type of models , the understanding of the combinatorics of these models , and the analytic control over their partition function is remarkable , comprising a powerful large - n expansion , some understanding of critical behaviour and double scaling limits , results on the schwinger - dyson equations of several models , nice universality results , and much more .",
    "for all this , we refer to the literature .",
    "what we focus on here , instead , is the models that are obtained by enriching this already rich combinatorial models via group - theoretic data , namely group field theories . by this",
    "we mean models of the same tensor type but with index spaces replaced by lie group manifolds ( or subspaces thereof ) , as we will describe , so that one has a ( complex ) field @xmath23 instead of the finite tensor @xmath14",
    ". why is this enrichment useful at all",
    "? one may indeed fear that it would correspond to an unnecessary complication of already complicated models , at the same time losing the beauty of a purely combinatorial definition of the fundamental structure of space and time ( which is , by the way , successful in 2d as matrix models for liouville quantum gravity show ) .",
    "the main advantages are the following :    \\1 ) the definition of a proper renormalisation group flow , in turn very useful for handling the quantum dynamics of such field - theoretic models , requires the soft breaking by the kinetic term of the invariances of the interactions ( be them based on the simplicial or the tensor invariance principles ) ; this is conveniently obtained with @xmath5s involving differential operators which in turn require the domain of the field @xmath14 to be a proper differentiable manifold ; ( lie ) groups are an obvious choice ;    \\2 ) turning the index set into a group manifold turns the tensor model into a proper quantum field theory with ( a priori ) an infinite number of degrees of freedom , greatly widening not only the possibilities for model building but also the set of quantum field theory tools that can be used to analyse them , and leading to richer phase structure , symmetries , etc ; on the one hand , there is no proof that this widening is necessary , of course ; on the other hand , it is reasonable to expect that it is , given the greater complexity of geometry and physics in dimensions higher than 2 , where the purely combinatorial matrix models suffice ; to face this complexity , it is nicer to have a larger variety of them at our disposal ;    \\3 ) most important , the additional data allow the tensor models framework to make direct contact with other promising approaches to quantum gravity , that is loop quantum gravity and spin foam models , and thus with another large set of physical insights and mathematical results ; obviously , these approaches also independently suggest that the group - theoretic data that characterise group field theories are a necessary ingredient of a fundamental description of space and time in a full quantum gravity context .",
    "thanks to the additional data , the connection with discrete geometry and lattice gravity path integrals can also be refined , leading to further progress . and",
    "further progress can be expect via the use of tools from non - commutative geometry , which are made available by the additional data .",
    "we will now turn to a brief description of group field theories and of the above connections .",
    "as anticipated , group field theories are field theories over a lie group manifold @xmath24 , in such a way that tensor models can be understood as a special case in which the lie group is replaced by a finite group , e.g. @xmath25 , or even its underlying finite set of n elements , neglecting the group structure entirely .",
    "we thus have the ( complex ) field @xmath26 as our basic variable . as such ,",
    "the underlying phase space for each gft quantumis the cotangent bundle @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , for quantum gravity applications , as we will see , the most relevant groups are @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( or , in the lorentzian signature , which will not concern us here , @xmath30 ) .",
    "the connection with loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) and with lattice gravity at the kinematical level is then immediate to sketch .",
    "canonical variables in this phase space are thus @xmath19 pairs of group elements and lie algebra elements @xmath31 , understood as classical configuration and moment variables .",
    "given this choice of canonical variables , one can expect two basic representations for quantum states : one in terms of functions of group elements , and one in terms of conjugate lie algebra elements .",
    "as we will discuss , the latter representation requires new mathematical tools from non - commutative geometry to be defined , due to the fact that the lie algebra of @xmath32 is , in general , a non - commutative space .",
    "another equivalent representation arises instead from the peter - weyl expansion of functions on the group in irreducible representations of the group itself .",
    "the classical lqg phase space is , roughly speaking , composed of a copy of the same cotangent bundle @xmath33 for each link of all possible graphs @xmath34 .",
    "correspondingly , quantum states of the gravitational field in loop quantum gravity @xcite are associated to all possible graphs @xmath34 in such a way that they form a hilbert space of functions @xmath35 , with respect to the haar measure , where @xmath36 is the number of links in the graph @xmath34 . restricting in particular to d - valent graphs",
    ", one can embed each of the above hilbert spaces @xmath37 into the space @xmath38 , where @xmath20 is the number of vertices in the graph @xmath34 . in more physical language",
    ", one can consider any lqg state associated to a graph @xmath34 as a specific many - particlestate in which each particleis represented by an open spin network vertex , that is a graph vertex with @xmath19 open links attached to it , and with @xmath19 group elements associated to them , so that the original graph is obtained by gluingthe open spin network vertices to one another along their links . considering the hilbert space for all possible number of vertices @xmath20 @xmath39 , one obtains a hilbert space large enough to contain all possible graph - based lqg states ( the exact hilbert space structure is different than in standard lqg , due to the different scalar product and the avoidance of any cylindrical consistency condition and projective limit , here ) .",
    "gauge invariance conditions can be imposed in the usual way with respect to the group action at the vertices of the graphs .",
    "this last hilbert space can be recast in 2nd quantised language as a fock space , using the standard construction , and under the assumption of bosonic statistics for the open spin network vertices(other choices are of course possible ) .",
    "the resulting fock space is the kinematical space of quantum states of group field theories based on this choice of group , and in absence of additional conditions on the gft field or on its dynamics .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "still at the kinematical level , one realises immediately that each gft quantum can be equally depicted as a ( d-1)-simplex dual to the d - valent open spin network , similarly to tensor models , but now with its ( d-2)-faces labelled by group elements @xmath40 or by lie algebra elements @xmath41 .",
    "generic states are then going to be dual to ( d-1)-simplicial complexes labelled by the same algebraic data .",
    "a first interpretation is that these are exactly the classical data of topological bf theories discretized on a simplicial complex . indeed ,",
    "when appropriate gauge invariance conditions are imposed , gfts produce the same classical phase space of simplicial bf theories , generalised to arbitrary simplicial complexes and superpositions of them at the quantum level .",
    "these data can be understood already in terms of discrete simplicial geometry in @xmath12 , where bf theory coincides with 3d gravity in the first order formalism . in this case , the lie algebra variables correspond to discretised triad fields and the group elements to elementary parallel transports of the gauge connection ( before metricity is imposed by the equations of motion ) .",
    "we are going to describe the gft formulation of 3d gravity in some more detail in the following . in higher dimensions , @xmath42 in particular ,",
    "bf variables can be understood in geometric terms only after appropriate geometricity conditions , called simplicity constraintsare imposed @xcite .",
    "the imposition of them in the gft models describing bf theory in 4d , assuming this is done correctly , results in models with the right quantum geometric data to describe 4d quantum gravity .",
    "we are going to see an example of this construction in the following .",
    "the correspondence of gft with lqg and discrete gravity carries on to the dynamical level . indeed , given any canonical operator equation to be imposed on lqg states and encoding the quantum dynamics of the theory , i.e. some version of the hamiltonian constraint operator , one can write down a corresponding second quantised equation in fock space for the gft states ; this then leads to the definition of a qft partition function for the corresponding gft model , assuming that one relaxes the requirement that only quantum states satisfying the quantum constraints are included in the partition function , thus working in the analogue of a grand canonical ensemble in which both energy and particle number are allowed to fluctuate ( with solutions of the hamiltonian constraint equation corresponding to zero energystates , and the number of particlesbeing the number of graph vertices in lqg states ) .",
    "we have then a direct correspondence between the canonical formulation of lqg and gfts at the dynamical level @xcite .",
    "the correspondence with the covariant formulation of lqg follows suit .",
    "given the gft partition function so obtained , its perturbative expansion defines transition amplitudes for quantum states in terms of a sum over cellular complexes @xmath10 , weighted by amplitudes @xmath21 which are now themselves integrals over the group ( or the lie algebra ) of functions of group or lie algebra elements ( or irreps of the group ) associated to the cellular complex .",
    "the latter amplitudes are , when written in terms of irreps of the group , so - called spin foam models , defining the covariant form of the dynamics of lqg . when written instead in terms of lie algebra elements",
    ", the same amplitudes take the form of lattice gravity path integrals , that is of path integrals for simplicial gravity ( like regge calculus ) , written in first order form , i.e. in the classical variables of discrete ( constrained ) bf theory .",
    "we will see these forms of the quantum amplitudes in the following , for specific examples .",
    "the crucial point to note , here , is that this important connection with lqg and with discrete gravity , providing a well - defined hilbert space as well as interesting quantum dynamical amplitudes , is possible only because of the additional group - theoretic data that enrich group field theories with respect to the simpler tensor models .",
    "the quantum geometry underlying both gfts and lqg is manifest in the lie algebra representation of their quantum states and amplitudes . because in this context the lie algebra elements are interpreted as fluxes of the gravitational triad field , this is also called _",
    "flux representation_. this uses some new tools from non - commutative geometry , namely a new notion of non - commutative fourier transform .",
    "let us introduce these mathematical tools , before showing a few specific applications in quantum gravity .",
    "we follow the presentation in @xcite , to which we refer for further references .",
    "our phase space of interest is the cotangent bundle @xmath43 , for a lie group @xmath32 , the extension to several copies of this phase space being straightforward @xcite . with the canonical symplectic structure",
    ", we get the poisson algebra @xmath44 , and for any functions @xmath45 we obtain the brackets @xmath46 where @xmath47 are lie derivatives with respect to an orthonormal basis of right - invariant vector fields , @xmath48 are euclidean coordinates on @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 the structure constants , and repeated indices are summed over .",
    "we now seek to quantize a _",
    "maximal subalgebra _",
    "@xmath52 of this poisson algebra , as an abstract operator @xmath53-algebra @xmath54 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath72 is endowed with a natural hopf algebra structure with coproduct @xmath73 , counit @xmath74 , and antipode @xmath75 , which can be used to define a hopf algebra structure for @xmath76 , which will be crucial to define what we called the algebra representation of the quantum system .",
    "given the algebra of observables , the task becomes that of finding representations of it on suitable hilbert spaces .",
    "the simplest to define is the _ group representation _",
    "@xmath77 on @xmath78 is defined as the one diagonalizing all the operators @xmath79 : @xmath80 , for all @xmath81 such that @xmath82 .",
    "the resulting function @xmath83 will not in general lie in @xmath78 for all @xmath84 , but we may restrict the domain of @xmath85 to be the subspace of @xmath60 of smooth compactly supported functions @xmath86 on @xmath32  dense in @xmath78  , so that @xmath87 for all @xmath88 .",
    "lie algebra operators @xmath89 are represented then as @xmath90 , with similar remarks about the domain of @xmath91 .",
    "the commutation relations are then correctly reproduced .",
    "the inner product is given for @xmath92 by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the right - invariant haar measure on @xmath32 .",
    "to prove this , one relies on the compatibility between the pointwise multiplication , used in the representation of operators , and the coproduct on the algebra .",
    "we now move on to define a representation in terms of functions of the classical dual space @xmath95 .",
    "obviously , the route taken to obtain the group representation can not used because @xmath96 do not commute .",
    "the strategy we adopt is then to _ deform _ the action @xmath97 , giving the needed freedom to satisfy the commutation relations",
    ". we will denote it by a star - product @xmath98 , and define for all @xmath99 @xmath100 , in such a way that the commutator @xmath101 = i c_{ij}^{\\phantom{ij}k}\\hat{x}_k$ ] turns into @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , we impose on the star - product the stronger condition @xmath103 , for all @xmath104 such that @xmath105 .",
    "this guarantees that @xmath106 has the interpretation of the function which upon quantization gives @xmath107 , and so establishes a connection between the classical phase space structure and the quantum operators .",
    "thus , @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath98-product and the quantization map @xmath110 are related by @xmath111 which is the idea of star - products defined in the context of deformation quantization and the choice of quantization map determines uniquely the @xmath98-product to be used in representing the quantum algebra in terms of functions on @xmath95 .",
    "now , given a star product @xmath98 and some coordinate operators @xmath64 , we define the representation of the operators @xmath64 and @xmath89 acting on the space of smooth compactly supported functions @xmath112 on @xmath95 to be @xmath113 where we denote @xmath114 .",
    "now , in order to show that we have a representation of the quantum algebra , the only non - trivial part is to show that the commutator @xmath115 $ ] is correctly reproduced , and this amounts to showing the compatibility between the star product and the coproduct on the observable algebra .",
    "this compatibility represent then a condition on the quantisation map to allow for an algebra representation as constructed here .",
    "the details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the next task is to find a unitary map between the two representations @xmath77 and @xmath116 of @xmath54 .",
    "we assume that this correspondence takes the form of an integral transform , generalising the standard fourier transform , @xmath117 : @xmath118 where @xmath119 , and we denote by @xmath120 the integral kernel of the transform .",
    "then , the goal is to identify the defining equations for the kernel @xmath120 , using the fact that the intertwined functional spaces define a representation of the same quantum algebra , and applying the action of @xmath54 in the different representations .",
    "its actual existence has then to be verified once an explicit choice of quantization map has been made .",
    "we find that the kernel @xmath120 si given by : @xmath121 with @xmath122 taken from any given branch of the logarithm .",
    "thus , given a deformation quantization @xmath98-product , this formula gives the general expression for the integral kernel @xmath120 .",
    "the same kernel should satisfy also @xmath123 the prefactor @xmath124 depends on the quantization map @xmath110 chosen . for a given @xmath98-product ,",
    "determining coordinates for which both forms are satisfied might be difficult and , in general , there is no guarantee that such coordinates exist .",
    "it is a requirement for the existence of the non - commutative fourier transform .",
    "some properties of these plane waves are : @xmath125 where the right - hand side is the dirac delta distribution with respect to the right - invariant haar measure on @xmath32 .",
    "this completes the definition of the integral transform @xmath126 intertwining the representations @xmath77 and @xmath116 : @xmath127 where @xmath122 is taken in the principal branch .",
    "the @xmath128-product is extended by linearity to the image of @xmath126    more interesting general properties of this non - commutative fourier transform can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us now give a few concrete examples of star products and plane waves following from specific choices of quantisation maps .",
    "we limit to the case of @xmath129 .",
    "a generic element @xmath130 can be written as @xmath131 , @xmath132 , where @xmath133 are the pauli matrices , while for any group element @xmath134 we have @xmath135 .",
    "another convenient parametrization of @xmath136 can be written as @xmath137 .",
    "these two parametrizations are thus related by the change of coordinates @xmath138 , where @xmath139 , or @xmath140 according to @xmath141 , @xmath142 respectively , and @xmath134 assumes the form @xmath143 .",
    "the so - called _ freidel - livine - majid map _ , is defined , for exponentials @xmath144 , as @xmath145 and can be basically seen as the symmetrization map in conjunction with a change of parametrization . accordingly : @xmath146 we may simply write @xmath147 , but the coordinates @xmath148 only cover the upper ( or lower ) hemisphere @xmath149 , and the resulting transform is applicable only for functions on @xmath150 .",
    "one also finds : @xmath151 the factor @xmath152 , introduced by the projection , is the sign of @xmath153 , which is 1 if both @xmath154 are close to zero or one of them is infinitesimal , and @xmath155 when the addition of two upper hemisphere vectors ends up in the lower hemisphere ( thus projecting the result to its antipode on the upper hemisphere ) .",
    "the @xmath156-monomials read @xmath157    the non - commutative fourier transform is then @xmath158    the _ duflo map _ is instead given by @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the symmetric quantisation map and @xmath161 is the following function on @xmath162 @xmath163 where the last expression holds for @xmath164 .",
    "when applied to exponentials , it gives @xmath165 which can be inverted to @xmath166 on monomials , we get : @xmath167 for the non - commutative plane wave we again have the corresponding projected star - product @xmath168 , which satisfies @xmath169    where @xmath170 is the lie algebra element resulting from the bch formula .",
    "the explicit form of the non - commutative fourier transform is thus @xmath171    we are now ready to show some applications of the algebra / flux representation to gft , discrete gravity , spin foam models and lqg , highlighting the connections between these formalims .",
    "the main advantage of using the flux / algebra representation for gft fields and amplitudes is that it brings the quantum geometry underlying them to the forefront . indeed , as mentioned above , the algebra variables have the interpretation of discrete triad fields associated to the edges of the simplicial complexes defining the quantum states and the amplitudes , in 3d gravity , or of discrete b fields associated to triangles of simplicial complexes in 4d bf models , that become invertible for a discrete tetrad field once geometricity constraints are imposed",
