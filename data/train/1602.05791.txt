    "since their first creation in ultracold atomic samples of rubidium @xcite , sodium @xcite , and lithium @xcite in 1995 , bose - einstein condensates have served scientists as a versatile toolbox for quantum simulation of other quantum systems in , for instance , condensed matter @xcite .",
    "recent experimental developments with ultracold atoms include the implementation of state - dependent one - body potentials @xcite , artificial spin - orbit coupling @xcite and gauge fields @xcite .",
    "these developments make it necessary to scrutinize several internal degrees of freedom or the hyperfine states of the atoms .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the description of such systems necessitates dealing with the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation of interacting , indistinguishable bosonic particles with an internal structure .",
    "popular approaches to the problem in continuous space are the mean - field gross - pitaevskii approach @xcite and its stochastic variations @xcite . for atoms in discretized space or lattices , matrix product states @xcite and",
    "the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite are widespread methods .",
    "there is to date , however , no `` general '' and in principle exact theoretical description for bosonic atoms with internal structure in continuous space . here ,",
    "`` general '' stands for giving reliable predictions for the many - body physics and correlations of interacting bosons with internal structure for any spatial dimension , any interparticle interaction , and any one - body potential .",
    "most realizations of ultracold bosons with internal degrees of freedom are therefore described with a multi - component gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite . in the case of bosonic particles without structure a method",
    "which self - consistently incorporates correlations has been devised : the ( multi - layer ) multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree for bosons method ( mctdhb ) @xcite ( @xcite ) . in particular , mctdhb is capable of describing fragmentation @xcite and correlations @xcite , i.e. , samples of ultracold bosons where the reduced one - body density matrix has several eigenvalues of the order of the particle number @xcite .",
    "@xcite mentions the applicability of the mctdhb to particles with internal degrees of freedom , but does not further discussed or show an implementation of it .",

    "importantly , fragmentation and thereby correlations which are neglected in mean - field approaches like the gross - pitaevskii equation , are known to be present in spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that fragmentation may emerge dynamically @xcite , and that it is present in systems with spin - orbit coupling @xcite or systems with angular momentum @xcite .",
    "this renders an in principle exact method like mctdhb which can make accurate predictions for the many - body correlations of fragmented systems with internal degrees of freedom like spin or a level - structure a much needed and versatile tool .",
    "the present paper derives the mctdhb equations of motion for the case of bosons with an internal structure which may be seen as a generalization of the multi - orbital mean - field theory developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to the realm of many - body physics .",
    "the capabilities of the derived theory are demonstrated by exhibiting the emergence of fragmentation and correlations in a system with one - body potentials which are dependent on the internal state of the considered particles similar to the experimentally realized one in refs .",
    "a new kind of fragmentation which is qualitatively different from the single - component fragmentation of bosonic systems without internal degrees of freedom is found : composite fragmentation ",
    "the system s components maintain their coherence while the coherence between them is lost .",

    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ mctdhb ] , the equations of motion of mctdhb for particles with internal degrees of freedom are derived , in section [ deltafrag ] the emergence of fragmentation and correlations in the groundstate of a system with state - dependent one - body potentials is demonstrated .",

    "we checked the exactness of our grid representation by making sure that the densities are less than @xmath114 of their maximal values on the edges of the grid .",
    "furthermore , we assessed that the energy differs by a factor less than @xmath114 in computations with @xmath112 and @xmath115 functions in the discrete variable representation . since the results below do not change anymore when we increase the number of variational parameters ( orbitals @xmath34 ) or the number of grid points , they are _ numerically exact_. we commence the analysis by first computing the component and composite densities [ cf . eqs .  , ] as well as the fragmentation [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] and plot them in fig .",
    "[ fig : densities ] .",
    "the component and composite densities follow an intuitive pattern : the component densities retain their gaussian shape irrespective of the separation @xmath69 , but their maxima follow the @xmath69-dependent minima of the state - dependent potentials .",
    "since the repulsion in state @xmath57 is slightly weaker than in state @xmath56 , the number of bosons in state @xmath57 is roughly @xmath116 , i.e. , slightly larger than that of state @xmath56 which is roughly @xmath117 for small separations @xmath69 . for larger separations ,",
    "this imbalance disappears gradually and is gone from @xmath118 .",
    "already in this simple example , fragmentation emerges once the separation becomes larger than @xmath119 ( see lowest panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : densities ] ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to bosonic atoms with contact interactions and without internal degrees of freedom , where fragmentation in single well traps is almost absent @xcite . in the present case of atoms with internal degrees of freedom ,",
    "weak interactions are sufficient to yield a fully two - fold fragmented state for @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 while @xmath123 .",
    "this behavior of the fragmentation resembles the case of bosons without internal degrees of freedom in a double well when the height of the barrier in the center is increased @xcite : there are precisely two significant natural occupations and , as mentioned , the others are zero . a marked difference between the single - component system in a double well and the present case of bosons with internal degrees of freedom which feel different one - body potentials is the absence of a potential barrier : the atoms reside in single wells , but in distinct internal states .",
    "furthermore , there is a minimal imbalance of @xmath124 of the number of atoms in the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 internal state of the atoms , because the scattering rate @xmath125 is slightly larger than @xmath126 . for fragmented , structureless bosons in a symmetric",
    "double well , there is no such imbalance .",
    "it is of further interest to determine if the two - fold fragmentation of the system is due to the macroscopic occupation of two orbitals @xmath127 which have non - vanishing contributions in both their components @xmath128 for @xmath129 or if in some orbitals the contributions of one component vanishes , i.e. , if @xmath130 holds for some @xmath131 . to asses",
    "this , one may investigate correlation functions or plot the orbitals components .",
    "we defer a detailed analysis of the coefficients and orbitals which build up the many - body wavefunction to the appendix and move on to investigate the spatial one - body correlation functions @xmath100 of the system encompassing its fragmentation .    to get a spatially- and state - resolved picture of fragmentation in the two - component system , we plot the composite and component correlation functions @xmath132,@xmath133 , and @xmath134 , respectively , for various separations @xmath69 in fig .  [ fig : corr ] . when the separation is close to zero , the coherence of the sample is maintained in all space , since both , the component and composite correlation functions are almost unity , i.e. , @xmath135 ( see top row of panels in fig .  [",

    "as soon as the separation @xmath69 is increased , the off - diagonal of the composite correlation function starts to drop to zero rapidly ",
    "the component correlation functions , however , show clearly that the coherence within the two internal states of the atoms is maintained , i.e. @xmath136 ( see middle row of fig .  [",
    "fig : corr ] ) .",
    "when the system is fully split , the components still maintain their coherence while the composite coherence is almost completely gone ( see bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ) .",
    "the fragmentation observed here hence differs qualitatively from fragmentation in the case of bosonic particles without internal structure : the coherence is lost not between the atoms in one component , but between the atoms in distinct components of the system .",
    "we hence term this kind of fragmentation `` composite fragmentation '' as opposed to `` component fragmentation '' which can also be seen for single - component systems ( see for instance refs .",
    "the composite correlation function bears some resemblance to the case of bosons without internal degrees of freedom in a double well with a large barrier @xcite . since",
    "composite fragmentation emerges when the spatial overlap of the component densities becomes small , we infer that this triggers fragmentation in the present case .",
    "the theory described here for bosons with internal structure constitutes a generalization of the mctdhb method which substantially enriches the many - body physics that can be described with the approach . since mctdhb is a method that is in principle exact",
    " once convergence with the number of variational parameters is achieved , the result is a solution of the full time - dependent many - body problem  numerically exact solutions of the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation for interacting bosons with internal degrees of freedom are enabled by this work .",
    "moreover , the software implementation of mctdhb for systems with internal degrees of freedom which was used to obtain the results in this work is incorporated in the mctdh - x software and openly available @xcite .",
    "the emergence of fragmentation was found in the ground state of @xmath1 bosons , when the minima of their state - dependent parabolic one - body potentials are taken apart .",
    "interestingly , the emergent fragmentation is visible in a decreased coherence quantified by the composite correlation function and absent in the component correlation functions .",
    "such a buildup of correlations and loss of coherence can not be present in single - component systems , because these can have correlations only between atoms in distinct orbitals and not between atoms in distinct components .",

    "<S> in this paper the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree for bosons method ( mctdhb ) is derived for the case of @xmath0 identical bosons with internal degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the theory for bosons with internal degrees of freedom constitutes a generalization of the mctdhb method that substantially enriches the many - body physics that can be described . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the numerically exact solution of the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation for interacting bosonic particles with internal degrees of freedom is now feasible . </S>",
    "<S> we report on the mctdhb equations of motion for bosons with internal degrees of freedom and their implementation for a general many - body hamiltonian with one - body and two - body terms that , both , may depend on the internal states of the considered particles . to demonstrate the capabilities of the theory and its software implementation integrated in the mctdh - x software , we apply mctdhb to the emergence of fragmentation of parabolically trapped bosons with two internal states : we study the groundstate of @xmath1 parabolically confined bosons as a function of the separation between the state - dependent minima of the two parabolic potentials . to quantify the coherence of the system we compute its normalized one - body correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the coherence within each internal state of the atoms is maintained , while it is lost between the different internal states . </S>",
    "<S> this is a hallmark of a new kind of fragmentation which is absent in bosons without internal structure . </S>",
    "<S> we term the emergent phenomenon `` composite fragmentation '' . </S>"
