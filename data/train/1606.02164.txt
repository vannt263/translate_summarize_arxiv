    "the observational data coming from type ia supernovae in the late 90 s @xcite indicated that in addition to the radiation and matter domination eras , there is also a late - time acceleration era , which occurred after the matter domination era and the universe is expanding in an accelerating way ever since .",
    "this observation utterly changed our perception for the universe cosmological evolution , and it is a challenge for theoretical cosmologists to consistently describe the evolution of the universe . with regards to the radiation domination era , at the beginning of this era it is believed that the universe experienced a rapid acceleration era known nowadays as the inflationary era . during this era",
    "the universe increased its size significantly and after the end of this era , the universe continued its expansion in a decelerating way , with the effective equation of state of the universe being described by a radiation perfect matter fluid .",
    "it is therefore compelling to find a model which can harbor all the evolution era of the universe , in the same theoretical framework .",
    "modified gravity @xcite , in all its aspects and variant models , can describe consistently the evolution of the universe , so it is one of the most appealing candidates for the cosmological theory of everything , at least in the context of classical evolution .",
    "recently we have demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , that it is possible to describe in a unified way all the cosmological eras of the universe .",
    "the vital feature of the cosmological evolution which we realized , was the appearance of two type iv singularities occurring at the end of the inflationary era and at the end of the matter domination era respectively .",
    "the resulting cosmological model had quite appealing features , since near the second type iv singularity , the deceleration - acceleration transition occurred . also , the hubble radius decreased in a rapid way at early times , then it started to increase during the radiation and matter domination era , and finally it started to decrease at late times .",
    "the behavior of the hubble radius is exactly what is expected from a correct description of the universe evolution , since the primordial quantum modes exited the horizon at early times and reentered the horizon during the expansion of the hubble radius .",
    "in addition to this , we demonstrated that the model generates a nearly scale invariant power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations .",
    "having in mind that the study performed in ref .",
    "@xcite was realized in the context of an @xmath1 gravity , in this paper we will realize the cosmological evolution of ref .",
    "@xcite , but in the context of @xmath0 gravity @xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews . in @xmath0 gravity , instead of",
    "the ricci scalar @xmath2 , used in einstein - hilbert and @xmath1 gravity , the gauss - bonnet invariant is used , that is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , denotes the ricci tensor , while @xmath5 denotes the riemann tensor .",
    "the basic questions we want to address with this study are the following : firstly , what is the @xmath0 gravity which realizes the cosmological evolution of ref .",
    "@xcite and secondly , is this cosmology compatible with the latest planck @xcite observations ?",
    "particularly , we will investigate if the resulting power spectrum is scale or nearly scale invariant , as was in the @xmath1 gravity case ?",
    "the answer to the second question is not obvious and with our study we will quantitatively answer this question . as we demonstrate , the resulting spectrum is not scale invariant , and hence this shows that even it is possible to realize the same cosmological evolution by using different theoretical frameworks , the observational implications of each model is not necessarily compatible with observational data . for similar studies using the framework of modified gravity in order to unify all acceleration eras of the universe , see @xcite .",
    "the singularity structure of the model we shall study contains no crushing singularities , since it contains two type iv singularities .",
    "the latter ones are the mildest singularities , firstly classified in ref .",
    "@xcite , and recently intensively studied in @xcite .",
    "the first novel study on mild singularities was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later on these were developed in @xcite and see also @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature of the type iv singularities is that it is possible for the universe to smoothly pass through these , without any catastrophic implications on the physical quantities that can be defined on the three dimensional spacelike hypersurface defined at the time instance that the singularity occurs .",
    "however , the mild singularities affect significantly the dynamics of the cosmological evolution , with the most interesting case being the possibility that mild singularities can generate graceful exit from inflation @xcite .",
    "we need to stress that the cosmological model which we shall study does not describe the pre - inflationary era , where a cosmic singularity at @xmath6 might occur .",
    "in fact , in the literature there exist various cosmological scenarios for this pre - inflationary era , in which case a crushing singularity might or might not occur , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , in our case the focus will be on later times and particularly for times near the beginning of inflation and after .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present all the essential features of the unified cosmological model , and particularly how it succeeds to describe the early - time acceleration era , the late - time acceleration era , the radiation domination era and the matter domination era .",
    "we also describe in brief the origin of primordial curvature perturbations and the behavior of the hubble horizon . in section iii",
    "we investigate how the unification evolution can be described by a vacuum @xmath0 gravity and in section iv , using well known techniques @xcite , we calculate in detail the resulting power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations and the corresponding spectral index .",
    "in addition , we investigate how the primordial perturbations evolve after the horizon crossing .",
    "the conclusions follow in the end of the paper .",
    "in this section we describe in some detail the cosmological model which was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to understand the qualitative features of the cosmological evolution described by it .",
    "as we now demonstrate , the model describes in a unified way the inflationary era , in terms of an initial quasi - de sitter evolution , the radiation domination and matter domination era , and the late - time acceleration era .",
    "as we shall see , certain fine - tuning of the free parameters is needed so that a late - time acceleration era is achieved .",
    "the hubble rate of the unified cosmological evolution is appears below @xcite , @xmath7 where the parameter @xmath8 is chosen to be of the order @xmath9sec and it characterizes the transition from the radiation domination to the matter domination era .",
    "also the parameter @xmath10 is assumed to characterize the late - time era and also @xmath11 characterizes the early - time era .",
    "particularly , at the time instances @xmath12 and @xmath13 , finite time singularities occur , which depending on the values of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , can be one of the following types ,    * if @xmath16 , then the cosmological evolution develops two big rip singularities . *",
    "if @xmath17 , then the cosmological evolution develops two type iii singularities .",
    "* when @xmath18 , then the cosmological evolution develops two type ii singularities . * when @xmath19 , then the cosmological evolution develops two type iv singularities .",
    "it is conceivable that certain combinations can occur , if the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are chosen appropriately , for example we can have a big rip singularity at late times and a type iv singularity at early times , if @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but we shall assume that both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are chosen as @xmath22 .",
    "so this means that two type iv singularities occur for the cosmological model ( [ newmodel ] ) .",
    "particularly , the time instance @xmath12 is assumed to occur at early times and at the end of the inflationary era , while @xmath13 is assumed to occur at late times , near the deceleration - acceleration transition . in order to avoid certain instabilities which might be generated for certain values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite",
    ", we further assume that @xmath23 .",
    "also we assume that the parameters have the following values , @xmath24 and as we show the parameter @xmath25 crucially determines the late - time behavior of the model .",
    "for the parameters chosen as in ( [ parameterschoicegeneral ] ) , the cosmological evolution of the model ( [ newmodel ] ) at early times is described by the first term of ( [ newmodel ] ) .",
    "when we refer to the early times , it is meant that early times correspond to the inflationary era and right after that , in which case , the function @xmath26 , for @xmath27sec , and for @xmath28 , is approximately equal to , @xmath29 consequently , the last term of the hubble rate ( [ newmodel ] ) is approximated at early times as follows , @xmath30 owing to the fact that during the slow - roll inflationary phase , we have @xmath31 .",
    "consequently , the hubble rate of the cosmological evolution at early times is approximated by a quasi de sitter evolution of the form , @xmath32 the effective equation of state ( eos ) of the cosmological evolution , which for modified gravity models is equal to @xcite , @xmath33 takes the following form at early times , @xmath34 where we took into account that @xmath35 .",
    "since the term @xmath36 , the eos corresponds to a nearly de sitter evolution at early times , since @xmath37 .",
    "after the inflationary era , which ends at approximately @xmath38sec , the universe is described by the radiation domination era which will last until @xmath39sec , as we now demonstrate . for the values of the cosmic time chosen in the interval @xmath40sec ,",
    "the function @xmath41 is approximately equal to @xmath42 , and owing to the fact that @xmath43 , the only dominant term is the hubble rate ( [ newmodel ] ) is the last term , which is approximated by , @xmath44 since in this case , @xmath45 , clearly this corresponds to a radiation domination era , with the eos being equal to @xmath46 .",
    "the behavior around the cosmic time @xmath47 is a bit peculiar , since it describes an intermediate era between the radiation domination and matter domination era . in this case , for @xmath48sec , the function @xmath41 is approximately equal to zero , that is , @xmath49 , and therefore , the hubble rate ( [ newmodel ] ) becomes , @xmath50 which corresponds to an eos approximately equal to , @xmath51 .",
    "clearly , the value of the eos @xmath52 describes an intermediate era between the matter and radiation era , and it is conceivable that the eos continuously deforms from @xmath53 to @xmath54 . in some sense",
    ", this could describe a new matter form , which is collisional @xcite , that is , weakly self - interacting . after the radiation to matter domination transition , and in the cosmic time interval @xmath55sec , the function @xmath56 is approximated by @xmath57 , so the hubble rate is approximated by the following expression , @xmath58 which corresponds to a matter domination era , with an eos @xmath59 .",
    "finally , after the time instance @xmath60 , the second term of the hubble rate ( [ newmodel ] ) starts to dominate , so this term generates the late - time acceleration era , with an eos parameter , @xmath61 which for @xmath62 describes a nearly de sitter acceleration era .",
    "now we describe in brief the behavior of the hubble horizon radius @xmath63 , corresponding to the model ( [ newmodel ] ) , and we discuss the qualitative features that render the model a successful approximation of a viable cosmology . in figs .",
    "[ hubradiusnew ] and [ hubradiusnew1 ] , we have plotted the time dependence of the hubble radius corresponding to the model ( [ newmodel ] ) , for three values of the parameter @xmath25 , namely for @xmath64 ( fig .",

    "[ hubradiusnew1 ] .",
    "actually as @xmath25 decreases , the deceleration - acceleration transition occurs at later and later times .",
    "so we focus on the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ hubradiusnew ] , so for @xmath73 . for this case ,",
    "the hubble radius at early times decreases in a nearly exponential way ( recall it is a quasi de sitter accelerating era ) , then it increases during the radiation and matter domination era and it decreases again after the second type iv singularity which occurs at @xmath74sec .",
    "clearly this is a viable cosmological behavior , when primordial quantum fluctuating modes are taken into account .",
    "particularly , the primordial vacuum quantum modes are initially well inside the hubble radius , at the beginning of the inflationary era , at which point their wavenumber satisfies @xmath75 .     as a function of the cosmic time , for @xmath67 @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath27sec and for @xmath76 (",

    "then , the hubble horizon increases until after the second type iv singularity , where the deceleration to acceleration transition occurs , and the hubble horizon starts to decrease again .",
    "note that the behavior we just described characterizes a viable inflationary cosmology @xcite . in conclusion the model ( [ newmodel ] )",
    "has the following appealing qualitative features :    * it describes in a unified way all the cosmological eras of the universe , namely , the late and early - time acceleration era and the matter and radiation domination eras . *",
    "it is predicted that there is an intermediate era between the radiation and matter domination transition , where the eos of the universe continuously deforms from a radiation dominated value to a matter domination value .",
    "note that such an eos describes collisional matter fluids @xcite .",
    "* the hubble horizon behaves in the correct way , as is expected for a viable cosmological evolution .",
    "what remains unanswered for the moment is the question if the power spectrum that is generated during inflation is scale invariant and secondly , if the primordial modes , after the horizon exit evolve or these are described by a constant stochastic mean value .",
    "these questions shall be addressed in detail in a later section of this article .",
    "note that the answer to these questions strongly depends on the modified gravity model which realizes the cosmological evolution we just described , so these are of fundamental importance , since this will determine if the @xmath0 gravity approach we shall use in this paper is consistent with observations .",
    "before we answer these , in the next section we investigate how the cosmological evolution ( [ newmodel ] ) can be realized in the context of @xmath0 gravity .",

    "having the time dependence of the comoving curvature perturbation at hand , we can easily compute the power spectrum , which in terms of @xmath154 is equal to , @xmath155 and it is defined at the horizon crossing .",

    "before closing , note that the resulting picture might be an artifact of the approximate expressions we used for obtaining the early - time @xmath0 gravity .",
    "hence , it could be possible that a loop quantum cosmology corrected @xmath0 gravity theory @xcite could produce a scale invariant spectrum .",

    "we hope to address this issue in detail in the future .",
    "a last issue we want to address before we close thus section , is the evolution of the primordial perturbations after these exit the hubble horizon during inflation . in standard inflationary cosmology ,",
    "the primordial perturbations do not evolve in time after the horizon crossing and these are described by a stochastic mean value , and hence these are conserved and remain unaltered until these enter the horizon at a later stage .",
    "this is a crucial feature of the standard inflationary scenario , since the conservation of the primordial modes enables us to make predictions about inflation .",
    "this is due to the fact that when these modes reenter the horizon , these reveal us the form of perturbations when these exited the horizon at early times .",
    "there are scenarios in cosmology for which the perturbations evolve in time , like for example in the matter bounce scenario case @xcite .",
    "as we now demonstrate , the primordial perturbations do not grow in the present case , but exponentially decay at times after the horizon crossing .    in order to proceed ,",
    "we will focus on primordial modes for which the wavenumber satisfies @xmath174 . in that case ,",
    "the differential equation ( [ perteqnmain ] ) becomes , @xmath175 the solution of which is , @xmath176 where @xmath145 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ gfgdhbhhyhjs ] ) , and @xmath150 are arbitrary integration constants .",
    "we shall be interested in cosmic times just after the end of inflation , so the scale factor can be approximated by @xmath177 , and also @xmath145 is approximately equal to , @xmath178 where we kept only dominant terms .",

    ", the @xmath0 gravity description differs from the @xmath1 gravity description , because the resulting power spectrum is not compatible with the latest observational data .",
    "thus , this quantitatively proves that not all modified gravity descriptions are equivalent and successful , when these are confronted with observations .",
    "of course , this is not obvious without explicitly calculating the power spectrum corresponding to each modified gravity description , so it would be interesting to address the problem we studied in this paper , in the context of more general modified gravity theories , like for example @xmath184 gravity @xcite . in that case , as was demonstrated in @xcite , @xmath185-powers of the wavenumber appear in the master equation which governs the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations , and thus superluminal modes appear in the spectrum .",
    "this behavior could alter the resulting picture for the cosmological evolution we studied in this paper , and we intend to address in a future work . in the same fashion ,",
    "the @xmath186 gravity @xcite case should also be investigated .",
    "an interesting question is whether the holonomy corrected @xmath0 theory @xcite can make the power spectrum nearly scale invariant .",
    "particularly , if we include the loop quantum cosmology effects , the question is whether the power spectrum is rendered scale invariant .",
    "this problem could be addressed in the way it was treated in @xcite , so the calculation of the power spectrum for the holonomy corrected theory is straightforward .",
