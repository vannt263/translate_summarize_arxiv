    "the multilayer coating is an idea for pushing up the field limit of superconducting ( sc ) accelerating cavity  @xcite . according to the recent theoretical studies  @xcite ,",
    "differences among the vortex - penetration fields of semi - infinite sc , sc thin film and multilayer sc are due to those of current densities or slopes of magnetic - field attenuation which are proportional to the force pushing a vortex into sc . for the case that a penetration depth of the sc layer is larger than that of the sc substrate , the current density or the slope of magnetic - field attenuation in the sc layer is suppressed , and the vortex - penetration field of the sc layer is pushed up .",
    "a combination of sc materials with different penetration depths is essential , but the insulator layer seems to be unnecessary . in this paper , the sc nano - layer coating without insulator layer is studied .",
    "first the magnetic - field distribution is computed .",
    "then a set of forces acting on a vortex is derived , which is different from that of the multilayer coating model , because of the existence of the boundary of two scs as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . by using the forces ,",

    "let us consider a model with an sc layer with a penetration depth @xmath2 and a coherence length @xmath3 formed on an sc substrate with a penetration depth @xmath4 and a coherence length @xmath5 .",
    "all layers are parallel to the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane and then perpendicular to the @xmath8-axis .",
    "the magnetic field is applied parallel to the layers .",
    "we assume the sc layer thickness @xmath9 is larger than their coherence lengths ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the proximity effect between the two scs . is neglected .",
    "the variational approach is an easy way to understand how the magnetic - field and the current density distribute in the system . defining magnetic - fields in the sc layer and sc substrate as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , current densities in the sc layer and sc substrate",
    "are given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "then the total energy of the system as a functional of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is given by @xmath17 \\!=\\!\\ ! \\int \\!\\ ! dydz \\sum_{k=1}^{2 } \\int_{l_{k-1}}^{l_{k}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "the above formalism can be easily generalized to an @xmath22 sc - layer system ( @xmath23 ) .    solving the above equations",

    "suppose there exist a vortex with the flux quantum @xmath27 parallel to @xmath28 at @xmath29 , where materials of the sc layer and the sc substrate are assumed to be extreme type ii scs , namely , @xmath30 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this vortex feels three distinct forces @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a force from the surface , @xmath35 is that from the boundary of two scs , and @xmath36 is that from a meissner current due to an applied magnetic - field .",
    "let us consider the case that a vortex is located at the region @xmath37 .",
    "the forces , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , can be evaluated by introducing image vortices to satisfy the boundary conditions ( bcs ) : the zero current normal to the surface and the continuity condition of the vector potential at the boundary of two scs . for simplicity",
    "we consider only two dominant images , an image antivortex with flux @xmath38 at @xmath39 and an image vortex with flux @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "the former and the latter correspond to bcs at the surface and the boundary , respectively",
    ". then we find @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the surface attracts the vortex and prevent the vortex penetration , and the boundary pushes the vortex to the direction of the sc material with a larger penetration depth , and thus prevent the vortex penetration if @xmath44 .",
    "the force , @xmath45 , is obtained by evaluating the meissner - current density at the vortex position @xmath46(see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and is given by @xmath47 which always pushes the vortex to the inside .",
    "for the case that a vortex is at @xmath48 , in order to satisfy bcs at the surface and the boundary , we introduce following two images : an image antivortex with flux @xmath49 at @xmath39 and an image antivortex with flux @xmath50 at @xmath41 .",

    "@xmath45 can be obtained in much the same way as before : @xmath52 which pushes the vortex to the inside .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows the free energy difference inside the sc layer for the case that zero or small magnetic field is applied . since both the surface and the boundary pushes a vortex to the surface , the free energy increases as a vortex approaches the boundary .",
