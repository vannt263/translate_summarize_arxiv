    "the crossover from ising - like to classical critical behavior has attracted renewed attention in recent years .",
    "this crossover behavior occurs in many thermodynamic systems , such as ionic solutions , simple fluids , fluid mixtures , and polymer mixtures . the ginzburg criterion  @xcite states that sufficiently close to the critical point these systems exhibit critical exponents belonging to the 3d ising universality class . at larger distances from the critical point , but still within the critical region , classical ( mean - field - like ) critical exponents are observed . although this appears to be a well - established picture , the precise nature of the crossover between these two universality classes is still subject to investigation .",
    "for example , anisimov _ et al .",
    "_ recently claimed  @xcite to have observed an `` effective '' susceptibility exponent which varied _ nonmonotonically _ from its classical value @xmath0 to its ising value @xmath1 when the critical point was approached .",
    "later , the possibility of such behavior within the critical domain was questioned by bagnuls and bervillier , see refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "fisher has argued  @xcite that nonmonotonical variation of effective critical exponents is not necessarily an indication of nonuniversal behavior .",
    "other questions concern the size of the crossover region , which is expected to span several decades in the crossover variable  @xcite , and the size of the temperature region around @xmath2 within which ising - like behavior is observed  @xcite . until now it has turned out to be very difficult to accurately observe the full crossover region in numerical simulations .",
    "a major effort has been undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite for three - dimensional polymer mixtures , where crossover occurs as a function of the polymer chain length .",
    "however , despite chain lengths of up to 512  monomers , the results did not span the full crossover region .",
    "for this reason , mon and binder  @xcite turned their attention to the two - dimensional ising model with an extended range of interaction , where a crossover from ising - like to classical critical behavior occurs when the range @xmath3 of the spin  spin interactions is increased ( suppressing the critical fluctuations ) . in two dimensions",
    "one can not only access larger interaction ranges , but also both asymptotic regimes are known exactly and the variation of the critical exponents is considerably larger than in the crossover from 3d ising - like critical behavior to classical critical behavior .",
    "mon and binder derived the ( singular ) @xmath3  dependence of the critical amplitudes of scaling functions and carried out monte carlo simulations to verify these predictions numerically .",
    "even in these two - dimensional systems , the mean - field regime turned out to be only barely reachable .    in a recent paper  @xcite , we rederived the predictions of mon and binder from renormalization theory and also obtained the @xmath3  dependence of various corrections to scaling , such as the shift of the critical temperature with respect to the mean - field critical temperature .",
    "furthermore , larger interaction ranges and system sizes were accessible to our numerical simulations thanks to a dedicated monte carlo algorithm .",
    "this enabled us to actually verify the theoretical predictions in two - dimensional systems . in this paper , we show that the simulations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite allow a full mapping of the finite - size crossover curves for various quantities .",
    "however , these curves describe the _ finite - size _ dependences of critical amplitudes , which have ( to our knowledge ) not been observed experimentally .",
    "therefore we have also carried out simulations at temperatures further from the critical temperature in order to observe the _",
    "thermal _ crossover of these quantities .",
    "the results of these simulations , which partially have been reported in an earlier note  @xcite , are presented as well .",
    "the fact that in our model both the temperature distance from the critical point and the interaction range can be varied turns out to be essential to observe the full crossover region .    the outline of the remainder this paper is as follows .",
    "after a short recapitulation of the model under investigation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) we start in sec .  [",
    "sec : finite ] with finite - size crossover scaling .",
    "we discuss the required system sizes and interaction ranges and obtain the crossover curves for the absolute magnetization density , magnetic susceptibility , and the spin ",
    "spin correlation function over half the system size .",
    "thermal crossover scaling is treated in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermal ] , where we consider the approach of @xmath2 both in the symmetric phase ( @xmath4 ) and in the state of broken symmetry ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "again , crossover curves are obtained for the order parameter and the susceptibility .",
    "the various aspects of these curves are discussed in some detail .",
    "graphs of the logarithmic derivatives of the crossover curves , which can be associated with so - called effective critical exponents as measured in experiments , are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : effexp ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we end with a summary of our conclusions .",
    "let us first briefly recall the model as it was introduced in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this is a two - dimensional ising system consisting of @xmath6 lattice sites with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each spin in the system interacts equally with its @xmath7  neighbors lying within a distance @xmath8 .",
    "this defines the coupling between two spins @xmath9 and  @xmath10 at a distance  @xmath11 as @xmath12 in the absence of an external magnetic field the hamiltonian is @xmath13 where the sums run over all spins in the system and @xmath14 denotes the position of spin @xmath9 .",
    "to suppress lattice effects we use an _ effective _ interaction range  @xmath3 , defined as @xmath15 for large ranges , @xmath3 approaches the limiting value @xmath16 .",
    "it has been shown by binder and deutsch  @xcite that crossover scaling can be combined with finite - size scaling by including the dependence on the crossover variable in the probability distribution function of the order parameter .",
    "indeed , just as crossover in the thermodynamic limit is described as a function of the reduced temperature divided by the ginzburg number , it can be described as the function of a size - dependent crossover variable  @xmath17 in finite systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this crossover variable was derived as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the linear system size and @xmath20 denotes the dimensionality .",
    "this also follows from the renormalization treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite . in short , sufficiently close to the gaussian fixed point",
    "( i.e. , for a sufficiently large interaction range @xmath3 ) the critical behavior will be classical . in terms of a renormalized landau ",
    "wilson  ( lgw ) hamiltonian in momentum space , this implies that the coefficient of the @xmath21  term must be much smaller than that of the @xmath22  term , @xmath23 ( cf .  in particular eq .",
    "( 6 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which again leads to the crossover parameter @xmath24 , where for the moment we assume that @xmath25 is of order unity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we focused our attention on the critical finite - size amplitudes in the limit of @xmath26",
    ". here we will examine the crossover in the corresponding data for _ finite _ system sizes . since the crossover regime is expected  @xcite to span several decades in the crossover variable @xmath27 , it is numerically not feasible to observe both asymptotic regimes by merely varying the system size @xmath19 while keeping the range @xmath3 fixed .",
    "therefore we construct the curve by combining the results for various values of @xmath3 , cf .  ref .",
    "indeed , the ising regime ( @xmath28 ) is easily reachable , although the results for very small ranges do not conform well to the leading @xmath3  dependence of the critical scaling functions  @xcite and are thus , at first sight , not well suited for constructing the crossover curve . the mean - field regime ( @xmath29 )",
    ", however , poses more substantial problems . if the linear system size  @xmath19 is made too small , the numerical results exhibit strong finite - size effects",
    ". therefore @xmath19 must be at least of the order of the interaction range .",
    "more precisely , boundary effects will occur for systems for which @xmath30 and the smallest possible value of the crossover variable  @xmath17 is roughly equal to @xmath31 .",
    "thus , large ranges are required to reach the regime where @xmath32 . in a conventional monte carlo algorithm",
    ", the efficiency of simulations rapidly decreases with increasing interaction range .",
    "this limitation has been circumvented by applying a dedicated cluster algorithm , as explained in ref .",
    "still , a problem remains .",
    "namely , the finite - size crossover scaling is valid _ at _ the critical temperature .",
    "any deviation from this temperature will lead to systematic errors in the analysis . since the ( range - dependent ) critical temperatures are determined in the ising limit , i.e.  from system sizes @xmath33 , large interaction ranges require _ very _ large system sizes for an accurate determination of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the most efficient way to obtain data for @xmath34 is to simulate a system with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "however , an accurate determination of @xmath38 requires system sizes of at least @xmath39 , whereas we have carried out simulations for system sizes up to @xmath40 lattice sites .",
    "this has been solved as follows .",
    "the renormalization treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite predicts the form of the function describing how @xmath41 deviates from the mean - field critical temperature when @xmath3 varies . by fitting this function to the accurately determined critical temperatures in our previous study",
    "an expression is obtained for @xmath41 from which the critical temperatures for very large ranges can be calculated to a relatively high accuracy .",
    "the shift of @xmath2 is expressed by @xmath42             + \\frac{a_3}{r^4 } \\ ; , \\label{eq : tc - scale}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and the last term is a higher - order correction omitted in ref .",
    "a least - squares fit for @xmath44 ( @xmath45 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) yielded @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "figure  [ fig : kc - scale ] shows the critical temperatures and expression  ( [ eq : tc - scale ] ) with the appropriate coefficients .      in the ising regime ,",
    "the absolute magnetization density scales ( at criticality ) asymptotically as @xmath49 , where the critical amplitude @xmath50 is a function of @xmath3 , @xmath51 . in the mean - field regime @xmath52 does not depend on @xmath3 , but is simply proportional to  @xmath53 . when plotting @xmath52 as a function of @xmath27 a data collapse is obtained if it is multiplied by a factor @xmath54 .",
    "this resulting quantity is proportional to @xmath55 in the ising regime and to @xmath56 in the mean - field regime .",
    "a suitable choice is @xmath57 , because this yields a quantity which is still independent of  @xmath3 in the mean - field regime .",
    "indeed , it is shown in the appendix that in a two - dimensional system in which all spin  spin interactions are equally strong , @xmath58 and @xmath59 will thus approach @xmath60  in the limit of @xmath61 . remark that our requirement @xmath62 unambiguously relates the limit @xmath61 to the mean - field ( @xmath63 ) limit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - cross](a ) we have plotted the absolute magnetization density multiplied by the square root of the system size versus the crossover variable .",

    "[ fig : magabs ] .",
    "the curve clearly yields an excellent description of the critical amplitudes , even for small ranges .",

    "for @xmath17 small the data indeed approach the mean - field prediction  ( [ eq : mag - mf ] ) .",
    "the fact that at @xmath74 the data for @xmath66 and @xmath65 coincide with those for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 confirms that the critical temperatures for the large ranges have been estimated accurately .",
    "the center of the crossover region lies between @xmath78 and @xmath79 which shows that the parameter  @xmath25 is indeed of order unity .",
    "finally , it is particularly encouraging that no remaining finite - size effects , causing deviations from the curve , are visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - cross](b ) , despite the factor that the correction factor was calculated in the @xmath26 limit and hence does not compensate for such higher - order finite - size effects .",

    "the susceptibility is in the ising regime proportional to @xmath83 , and in the mean - field regime it scales proportional to  @xmath19 . to obtain a data collapse for @xmath80 as a function of  @xmath17",

    "therefore we only show the resulting crossover curve for the susceptibility after the data have been divided by the correction factor between square brackets , see fig .",
    "[ fig : chi - cross ] . again , both the mean - field asymptotic result and the ising asymptote ( slope  @xmath89 ) are clearly reproduced , with a perfect collapse for all ranges .",
    "closely related to the magnetic susceptibility is the spin  spin correlation correlation function @xmath90 . in our simulations",
    "we have sampled @xmath91 , which scales both in the ising regime and in the mean - field regime as @xmath92 .",
    "thus , we obtain a data collapse by multiplying the finite - size data by @xmath93 , in which we have set @xmath94 . after correcting for the higher - order range - dependent corrections in the critical amplitude [ which have the same structure as those in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi - scale ] ) ] we obtain the graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g - cross ] . the full crossover curve can be mapped and shows a close resemblance to that for the susceptibility , including the approach of the asymptotic mean - field value . in the range @xmath95 , the data do not precisely coincide on a smooth curve .",

    "the approach of the ising value was clearly visible for @xmath19 large , but for small system sizes @xmath98 first decreased towards @xmath105 and then started to show strong finite - size effects .",
    "evidently , it is a better approach to construct the true crossover curve for @xmath106 by plotting finite - size data for @xmath98 for various ranges versus the crossover variable .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q - cross](a ) .",
    "several remarks apply to this graph .",
    "firstly , one notes that @xmath107 is indeed the appropriate crossover variable : a reasonable collapse is obtained for all values of @xmath19 and  @xmath3 . however , some remarkable deviations from this scaling behavior are present , which are most clearly visible in the range @xmath108 , but also present around @xmath109 .",
    "similar effects were already observed in the spin ",
    "spin correlation function , but now the effects stand out much more pronounced because we have employed for the amplitude ratio a linear instead of a logarithmic vertical scale .",
    "these deviations are due to nonlinear finite - size corrections , as can be seen clearly by zooming in into the deviations , see fig .",
    "[ fig : q - zoom ] .",
    "the data points for @xmath66 and @xmath65 may serve as a reference for the location of the `` true '' crossover curve .",
    "one observes that for each of the ranges @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and  @xmath77 the deviations from this curve increase with _ decreasing _ system size , which indeed shows that the effects are caused by finite - size corrections .",
    "if the deviations had been caused by , e.g. , an inaccurate determination of the critical temperature , the effects would have increased with increasing system size . unfortunately , it is not easy to separate these corrections from the leading crossover behavior ( except graphically ) , unless the full crossover function is known ( which in turn would limit the use of a numerical determination ) .",
    "of course this problem can be circumvented by determining the crossover at these values for  @xmath17 from systems with a larger system size and a larger interaction range .",
    "the deviations around @xmath109 are caused by the same effect , but now for systems with small  @xmath3 .",
    "although the amplitude ratio is more sensitive  even if one takes into account the difference in scale  to these finite - size effects than @xmath110 and  @xmath111 individually ( the curve for the latter is not shown here , but its smoothness is comparable to that of the susceptibility ) , @xmath98 is less sensitive to corrections to the leading range dependence . indeed , for @xmath111 these corrections are again of the form @xmath112 $ ] and @xmath98 must thus be divided by @xmath113 ^ 2 }      { 1 + r^{-2}(s_1 + s_2 \\ln r^2 ) + r^{-4}s_3 } \\;. \\label{eq : qfactor}\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and  @xmath116 have been determined from a least - squares fit to the critical amplitudes of @xmath111 and @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and  @xmath119 come from eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi - scale ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : corrfac ] shows the correction factors for @xmath120 , @xmath111 , and @xmath98 .",
    "evidently , the latter factor  ( [ eq : qfactor ] ) is much closer to unity than the former two .",
    "figure  [ fig : q - cross](b ) shows @xmath103 divided by the correction factor  ( [ eq : qfactor ] ) , which indeed shows only slightly less scatter than the graph without this correction factor .",
    "in particular the deviations for the larger ranges do not disappear .",
    "the finite - size crossover scaling studied in the previous section is an intrinsic finite - size effect which is not observable in thermodynamic systems . for this reason it is important to study its temperature - dependent counterpart as well",
    "this so - called _ thermal _ crossover , which was from a phenomenological scaling point of view already considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , is of course closely related to finite - size crossover : in finite systems crossover to mean - field - like behavior occurs when the _ system size _ has been decreased to the appropriate power of the interaction range ( i.e.  @xmath121 or @xmath122 for @xmath123 ) , whereas in the temperature - dependent case this crossover occurs when the temperature distance to the critical point is such the _ correlation length _ has become of the order of an appropriate power of the interaction range . in the latter case , the precise crossover location is determined by the ginzburg criterion , @xmath124 , where @xmath25 is the coefficient of the @xmath21  term in the lgw  hamiltonian .",
    "it should be kept in mind that these considerations are valid only _ within the critical region _ , i.e.  care must be exercised to keep the reduced temperature sufficiently small .",
    "when studying thermal crossover in practical simulations one has the additional complication that sufficiently close to @xmath2 the correlation length will always be bounded by the finite system size , which is precisely the situation one wants to avoid .",
    "so relatively large system sizes are required .    as follows from the ginzburg criterion ,",
    "the appropriate scaling variable in two dimensions is @xmath125 and one can therefore study thermal crossover effects by varying the interaction range as well .",
    "this is essential because of the following . for small values of  @xmath3",
    ", @xmath126 has to be made rather large to cross over to classical critical behavior and it is possible that one leaves the critical region before reaching the classical regime . on the other hand ,",
    "if one only studies systems with large interaction ranges , @xmath126 has to be made very small to observe ising - like critical behavior .",
    "however , for such small values of  @xmath126 extremely large system sizes are required to avoid finite - size effects .",
    "therefore we have constructed , just as in the previous section , crossover curves from results for various ranges .",
    "we have carried out simulations for the interaction ranges studied in ref .",
    "@xcite at temperatures further below  @xmath2 and also generated data for the interaction ranges @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and  @xmath130 .",
    "table  [ tab : largerange ] summarizes some properties of these systems .",
    "simulations have been carried out down to temperatures as low as @xmath131 . for the order parameter crossover",
    "can only be studied in the phase of broken symmetry , but for the susceptibility we have also considered the symmetric ( @xmath4 ) phase . since in this phase no saturation effects occur , much smaller interaction ranges suffice to span the full crossover region , as we will show below .      as derived in refs .",
    "@xcite the absolute magnetization density scales , sufficiently close to the critical point , as @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) , which for the two - dimensional case yields @xmath134 . in the mean - field regime ,",
    "on the other hand , the magnetization density is simply proportional to @xmath135 . when plotted as a function of @xmath125 , a data collapse for all ranges",
    "is now obtained if the magnetization density is multiplied by @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mag - temp](a ) shows the corresponding plot . we will discuss the various aspects of this graph in some more detail .",
    "the overall picture suggests that the data roughly follow the ising asymptote ( slope  @xmath136 ) for small values of @xmath125 and then gradually approach the mean - field asymptote ( slope  @xmath137 ) for large values of @xmath125 . here",
    "`` small '' and `` large '' refer to the absolute value of @xmath125 and `` slope '' is generally used for the logarithmic derivative , @xmath138 . for very small values of @xmath125 the data start to deviate from the ising asymptote at an @xmath19-dependent location and approximately follow ( for temperatures closer to @xmath2 ) a horizontal line . here one has entered the finite - size regime , where the correlation length is limited by the system size .",
    "this is the case which was studied in the previous section .",
    "the width of this regime depends ( for general  @xmath20 ) both on the system size and the interaction range , as can be read off from the universal scaling functions derived in ref .",
    "indeed , the temperature - dependent argument of these functions is @xmath139 ( @xmath140 in the 2d  ising universality class ) and the width of the finite - size regime is thus proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "note that the absence of any range dependence is _ not _ a general feature and even for the two - dimensional ising model only true to leading order ( cf .  fig .  5 of ref .",
    "higher order terms will entail range - dependent factors that involve ( for @xmath123 ) logarithms of  @xmath3 .",
    "outside of the finite - size regime , the data for each individual range first lie approximately on the ising asymptote , which has been drawn with an amplitude such that it coincides with the data for @xmath64 . for the smaller ranges",
    "the amplitudes of the asymptotes show a considerable range dependence , whereas for larger ranges the amplitudes converge . upon further decrease of the temperature ( increase of the absolute value of  @xmath126 ) several types of behavior",
    "occur : for the smallest range ( @xmath64 ) the data points still lie on the ising asymptote . for @xmath142 and @xmath143 the data leave the ising asymptote at sufficiently low temperatures and then follow a nearly straight line with a slope that lies between the ising and the mean - field asymptote . in these cases",
    "one has left the critical region without ever reaching the asymptotic mean - field regime . for each range",
    "the data for all system sizes coincide , as they should outside of the finite - size regime . for @xmath75 and @xmath104 the mean - field asymptote is approached much closer . however ,",
    "if the temperature is decreased further below the critical temperature the data points start to deviate from the asymptote again .",
    "this effect is caused by saturation of the magnetization and can be quantitatively described with mean - field theory , as we will show below . turning to even larger ranges , we see that the data now really reach the asymptote with slope  @xmath137 and follow it for up to one decade in the crossover variable ( for the largest range we have studied ) before saturation sets in .",
    "also the exact amplitude  @xmath144 ( see below ) of the asymptote is precisely reproduced , which shows again that the critical temperatures of the systems with large interaction ranges have been accurately determined : a deviation would have shifted the graph along the horizontal axis .",
    "we will now first consider the offset of the asymptotes in the ising regime .",
    "although this effect occurs outside the finite - size regime , we may well hope that the so - called finite - range corrections applied in the previous section [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : magabs - scale ] ) ] can be used here as well .",
    "indeed , these corrections are part of the universal scaling functions and although the amplitude @xmath145 is a specific limiting value , the range - dependent correction factor does not depend on this limit .",
    "especially the collapse obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - cross](b ) makes it very tempting to apply a similar correction here . on the other hand ,",
    "these corrections were calculated in the _ ising _ regime , which we here are gradually leaving . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag - temp](b ) we show the same data but now divided by the correction factor .",
    "although a perfect collapse is not obtained , the asymptotes lie much closer together than without this correction .",
    "also the critical amplitude of the ising asymptote is known exactly .",
    "indeed , by expanding onsager s expression for the spontaneous magnetization  @xcite , @xmath146^{1/8 } \\;,\\ ] ] around the critical point @xmath147 we obtain for @xmath133 @xmath148^{1/8 }      \\approx 1.22240995 ( -t)^{1/8 } \\;. \\label{eq : ising - asymptote}\\ ] ] for the nearest - neighbor ising model @xmath149 , so the fact that in fig .

    "( [ eq : magseries - r ] ) will give an accurate description of the _ relative _ saturation effects ( i.e. , the ratio of the saturated magnetization and the crossover curve ) down to probably even lower interaction ranges . to illustrate this",
    "we have divided the data for @xmath181 by the corresponding factor .",
    "the resulting graph [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mag - temp](c)]in which also the data points in the finite - size regime have been omitted  shows that the data for these large ranges now nicely coincide on one curve , which is the actual crossover curve for the order parameter .",
    "the fact that for different interaction ranges the data ( which overlap for considerable intervals of  @xmath125 ) coincide on one curve lends strong support to the hypothesis that the crossover curve is universal . as has already been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this contrasts with the conclusion drawn by anisimov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the three - dimensional case . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that in the crossover region microscopic cutoff effects are not negligibly small compared to the _ finite _ correlation length  @xmath182 , which implies that the form of the crossover curve depends on the ratio between  @xmath182 and the lattice spacing  @xmath183 . in our simulations we have not measured the correlation length directly , but we can still make a rough estimate from the data .",
    "namely , at the locations marking the boundaries of the finite - size regime for different interaction ranges and system sizes in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag - temp ] the correlation length is approximately equal to the system size . from the magnetization densities for @xmath181 we conclude that @xmath184 , independent of the interaction range .",
    "the latter conclusion is in agreement with the above - mentioned renormalization prediction that the width of the finite - size regime is to leading order independent of the interaction range .",

    ". however , the crossover curves coincide at fixed  @xmath125 and hence are independent of the ratio  @xmath185 .",
    "finally , we make some observations concerning the size of the crossover region .",
    "it is clear that it takes between two and three decades in the crossover variable to cross over from ising - like to classical critical behavior .",
    "thus , unless one studies systems with a rather large interaction range , one has to go to such a large temperature distance from @xmath2 to sufficiently decrease the correlation length compared to the interaction range that one has already left the critical region before observing classical critical behavior !",
    "the center of the crossover region lies in the neighborhood of  @xmath186 , consistent with a value for  @xmath25 of order unity .      unlike the order parameter , the magnetic susceptibility displays crossover upon approaching the critical point",
    "either from below or from above",
    ". we will discuss these two situations separately . in the ordered phase , @xmath187 ,",
    "we approximate the magnetic susceptibility by the so - called connected susceptibility , @xmath188 in the two - dimensional ising model with interaction range  @xmath3 this quantity will , close to the critical point , diverge as @xmath189 . further below  @xmath2 it will cross over to classical critical behavior , where @xmath190 . in a graph showing results for various ranges as a function of the crossover variable  @xmath125",
    "a data collapse is obtained for @xmath191 .",
    "however , just as for previous crossover curves , the data for small  @xmath3 will display an offset because of corrections to the leading @xmath192  dependence . to determine these deviations we first study the critical amplitude of the connected susceptibility , which was not considered in ref .",

    "the statistical uncertainty of this amplitude is notably larger than for @xmath52 and  @xmath193 ( cf .",

    "evidently , the latter amplitude shows a much stronger deviation from the leading range dependence , due to the fact that also @xmath41 deviates from @xmath195 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kc - scale ] ) .",
    "thus , although both amplitudes have the same asymptotic behavior for large interaction ranges , it is much more difficult to extract this behavior from medium - range results for @xmath194 than from the corresponding results for  @xmath196",
    ". this may partially explain the difficulties experienced in ref .",
    "the deviations have been fitted to a correction factor of the form @xmath197 $ ] , which we abbreviate as @xmath198 $ ] .",
    "indeed , the fact that the finite - range corrections for  @xmath196 are so small allowed us to neglect them altogether in ref .",

    "[ fig : con - h](a ) we show the connected susceptibility , appropriately scaled with  @xmath3 and divided by the correction factor  @xmath198 $ ] , as a function of the crossover variable . just as for the magnetization density ,",
    "deviations from the crossover curve are present even after the finite - range corrections have been applied .",
    "these effects are either caused by finite - size effects ( close to  @xmath2 ) or by systems that leave the critical region . in the latter case ,",
    "saturation effects start to come into play .",
    "the finite - size effects are clearly recognizable in the rightmost part of the graph , where the curves start to follow horizontal lines .",
    "once the temperature has been sufficiently decreased , the graphs start following an asymptote with slope  @xmath199 , on which the data for various ranges quite accurately collapse .",
    "the amplitude of this asymptote is simply related to the exactly known amplitude @xmath200  @xcite of the _ reduced _ susceptibility  @xmath201 .",
    "this reduced susceptibility is defined as @xmath202 , where @xmath203 denotes the magnetic moment of a spin .",
    "this magnetic moment has also in our calculations implicitly been divided out .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that we have expressed all temperatures in terms of the mean - field critical temperature , i.e.  @xmath204 , where @xmath7 is the coordination number . for the nearest - neighbor model this yields an additional factor  4 and",
    "we thus expect a critical amplitude @xmath205 .",
    "in addition we have to take into account the finite - range correction factor which has been divided out .",
    "the question whether this factor is applicable for @xmath156 has already been discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mag - therm ] [ below eq .",
    "( [ eq : ising - asymptote ] ) ] . here , the difference between the deviation from the leading scaling behavior as predicted by  @xmath198 $ ] and the numerical result is approximately  3% , whereas the smallest differences that can be discerned on the logarithmic scale of fig .",
    "[ fig : con - h](a ) are of the order of  5% .",
    "the asymptote with the above - mentioned amplitude divided by  @xmath198 $ ] indeed lies tangential to the crossover curve , confirming our data .",
    "as the temperature is further decreased , the data for systems with small interaction ranges start to follow a line with a slope between that of the ising and the mean - field asymptotes .",
    "this effect is caused by the fact that these systems have left the critical region .",
    "for sufficiently large interaction ranges , however , the curves coincide and have a slope that gradually decreases ( in the absolute sense ) .",
    "although the crossover curve at first varies more rapidly than for the magnetization density , it subsequently only slowly approaches the classical regime and the overall size of the crossover region is again between two and three decades .",
    "remarkably , the slope of the crossover curve passes even _ through _ the mean - field value  @xmath206 before settling at this value for sufficiently low temperatures . in other words , the derivative of the connected susceptibility appears to change nonmonotonically from its asymptotic ising value  @xmath199 to its classical value  @xmath206 .",
    "several explanations may be considered for this behavior .",
    "either it is an intrinsic effect of the crossover function or it might be explained from the fact that @xmath196 is the difference between @xmath207 and  @xmath208 , which each separately are described by a monotonically varying curve .",
    "the saturation effects can  just as for the magnetization density  for large ranges be described with mean - field theory . in a mean - field model",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is given by @xmath209 using eq .",

    "of course , these exponents change from their ising values to the classical values in the crossover region .",
    "however , the precise variation in the crossover region is unclarified and partially subject to debate .",
    "although these exponents can be read off from the form of the crossover curves presented in the previous section , we consider it worthwhile to present separate graphs displaying @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and  @xmath231 , where the superscripts denote the cases @xmath133 and @xmath232 , respectively .",
    "the additional advantage of these exponents is that they follow from data with the same range and hence are not affected by any range - dependent correction factors .    as the graph in fig .",
