    "these flow fluctuations and correlations can be studied by using a variety of experimental observables @xcite .",
    "specific suggestions proposed during the past decade include the following : the distribution of @xmath6 and associated initial eccentricities @xmath7 @xcite , the correlation between different flow angles ( event - plane correlators ) @xcite and between the magnitudes of the flow coefficients @xcite , a principle component analysis ( pca ) of flows @xcite , and the extraction of non - linear mode - coupling coefficients @xcite .",

    ", we study the correlations between different orders of flow using event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations with the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional code vish2 + 1 @xcite . our goal is to see whether all aspects of the large set of correlation data reported by atlas in @xcite are in qualitative agreement with the hydrodynamic paradigm .",
    "unfortunately , exploring detailed correlations among the event - by - event fluctuating flow coefficients requires large statistics not only on the experimental side , but also theoretically , where large numbers of events with fluctuating initial conditions must be simulated dynamically . to keep the numerical effort manageable",
    "we will perform the simulations in pure hydrodynamic mode , i.e. without switching to a microscopic description of the late hadronic stage .",
    "while such a hybrid approach will eventually be required for a fully quantitative comparison with the experimental data , the present study should be sufficient to recognize serious discrepancies with the hydrodynamic approach that might threaten to invalidate it . in this study",
    "we do not systematically explore the sensitivity of these correlations to the qgp shear viscosity @xmath11 and rather fix it to the value 0.08 which , for the monte carlo glauber initial conditions used here , is preferred by the @xmath12 distributions of identified hadrons and of the charged hadron elliptic and triangular flow @xcite . in appendix  [ appb ] we use a previously generated smaller set of hydrodynamic events with monte carlo kln initial conditions @xcite , which were evolved with three different values of the specific shear viscosity @xmath13 , and 0.2 , to discuss different possible shapes of the `` boomerang''-like dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath6 for different collision centralities that was pointed out by the atlas collaboration @xcite , and how these shapes vary with @xmath11 . ] since the flow fluctuations obtained from our pure hydrodynamic simulations are not expected to be quantitatively precise , we will refrain here from a direct comparison with the experimental data , but instead invite the reader to compare with the atlas data @xcite .",

    "the anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath6 are defined as the @xmath17th azimuthal fourier coefficient of the momentum spectrum .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that in the absence of event - by - event fluctuation ( i.e. for hydrodynamics with smooth initial condition ) even flow harmonics are correlated because , even if the fluid velocity profile is only elliptically deformed , a full set of even flow harmonics is in general generated because the fluid velocity enters through the exponent of the ( flow - boosted ) thermal distribution on the freeze - out surface . when ebe density fluctuations in the initial state are included , the resulting flow fluctuations of different harmonic orders ( both even and odd ) are , in general correlated by geometric constraints on the positions and shapes of these fluctuations inside the spatially deformed region where the colliding nuclei overlap .",
    "for example , by selecting events in which two suitably located upward fluctuations of the density generate an especially large geometric ellipticity , this selection restricts the possibility for adding a third hot spot to generate also large triangularity of the density distribution . and if such high - ellipticity events created by hot spots do feature also a triangular deformation , the axes of the corresponding ellipses and triangles ( i.e. the elliptic and triangular participant planes ) tend to be correlated @xcite .",

    "] we see that the two prescriptions yield compatible results : in central collisions , the linear contribution dominates the total flow , whereas the nonlinear contribution increases with increasing impact parameter ( at least in part through mode - mixing effects involving @xmath2 , as discussed in the preceding section ) .",
    "while the centrality dependence of the linear contributions to @xmath32 and @xmath48 is weak , the nonlinear contribution varies strongly with collision centrality .",
    "it is noteworthy that the separation of @xmath48 into linear and non - linear parts according to eqs .",

    "this is discussed in more detail in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "in a beautiful experimental analysis @xcite , the atlas collaboration recently performed a comprehensive analysis of correlations among the fluctuating anisotropic flow amplitudes @xmath6 in pb+pb collisions at the lhc , using a set of correlators that are completely insensitive to the associated fluctuating flow angles @xmath86 .",
    "the purpose of the present work was to study whether the experimentally measured flow amplitude correlations and their dependence on collision centrality can be described and understood within the otherwise highly successful hydrodynamic approach to the dynamical evolution of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we found qualitative agreement with all the main characteristics of the experimentally observed flow correlations .",
    "quantitatively the hydrodynamic model simulations fail in the most peripheral collisions where all anisotropic flow coefficients are overpredicted .",
    "we ascribe this failure predominantly to the lack of a proper microscopic description of the late hadronic stage in our pure hydrodynamic simulations which did not include a transition from fluid dynamics to a hadron cascade below the hadronization temperature .",
    "this is known to underestimate shear viscous effects and the associated suppression of anisotropic flow build - up in the hadronic phase .",
    "we showed that the correlations among the anisotropic flow amplitudes @xmath6 in part reflect similar correlations among the corresponding eccentricities @xmath7 of the fluctuating density profiles in the initial state , enhanced , however , by nonlinear mode - coupling effects in the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "for elliptic and triangular flow we found a linear anti - correlation that reflects a linear hydrodynamic mapping of a similar linear anti - correlation between the initial elliptic and triangular eccentricities . for higher - order flow harmonics",
    "the correlations between the corresponding initial eccentricities are found in general to be non - linear ; while their hydrodynamic mapping to flow correlations is found to be linear in central collisions , it becomes increasingly nonlinear in non - central collisions due to mode - coupling effects involving the growing elliptic flow @xmath0 .",
    "we decomposed the @xmath15 correlations into linear and non - linear contributions whose centrality dependence qualitatively agrees with the experimental data ; two different procedures for this decomposition yielded mutually compatible results . while the linear component depends only weakly on the collision centrality , the nonlinear component varies strongly with impact parameter .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the non - linear part of the correlation extracted by these methods includes nonlinearities from both the initial state ( through nonlinear eccentricity correlations ) and from the hydrodynamic evolution ( through mode - coupling effects ) which can not be separated model - independently .",
    "it is likely that both types of nonlinearities , the ones in the initial state and the hydrodynamic ones , are caused primarily by the elliptic geometric deformation of the nuclear overlap region in noncentral pb+pb collisions .",
    "this conjecture can be tested experimentally and theoretically in ultra - central u+u collisions where the nuclear overlap region is elliptically deformed even at zero impact parameter .    in appendix  [ appb ]",
    "we showed that the detailed shape of the centrality dependence of hydrodynamic @xmath15 correlations is quite sensitive to the shear viscosity of the expanding fluid , and also to the fluctuation spectrum of the initial state of the expanding fireball .",
    "this offers the hope that such correlations can in future studies be used as valuable constraints for both initial state fluctuation and qgp transport coefficients .",

    "the figure illustrates that several factors conspire to produce the observed centrality dependences of @xmath6 : ( 1 ) the centrality dependences of the driving eccentricities @xmath7 , ( 2 ) the centrality dependent duration of the hydrodynamic evolution which shortens the lifetime in peripheral collisions , cutting short the build - up of flow anisotropies , and which also controls the magnitude of the viscous corrections at freeze - out , and ( 3 ) the shear viscous damping of the anisotropic flow coefficients , especially for larger @xmath17 . in peripheral collisions",
    "the viscous damping of @xmath6 is stronger than in central collisions @xcite , so as the shear viscosity increases the anisotropic flows peak at lower centrality , and this shift of the peak to lower centralities increases with harmonic order @xmath17 .    in fig .",

    "we explore , as an example , the sensitivity of the decomposition of @xmath48 into its linear and nonlinear parts , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , to the number of @xmath22 or @xmath23 bins used in the event - shape selection procedure .    in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we show as circles and diamonds the linear parts of @xmath55 as a function of collision centrality , computed by fitting in each centrality bin the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath31 resp .",
    "@xmath30 with the last equation in ( [ fit ] ) , using information from 6 or 15 @xmath22 resp .",
    "@xmath23 bins .",
    "one sees that in all except the 35%-40% centrality bin the fits converge to almost exactly the same @xmath111 values whether we use 6 or 15 @xmath41-bins . if we had used 15 @xmath41-bins in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the results would have looked rather noisy , due to statistical limitations .",
    "[ f7 ] demonstrates that by reducing the number of @xmath41-bins to 6 , in order to see the trends in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] more cleanly , we are not sacrificing accuracy when separating @xmath73 into its linear and nonlinear contributions .    with larger numbers of events than we have at our disposal",
    ", one can add additional @xmath27 bins near the two ends of the @xmath27 distribution , to better explore the full range of event shapes .",
    "since the shape of the @xmath27 distribution depends on collision centrality , the optimal choice of the centers and widths of each @xmath27 bin may depend on centrality . with our limited statistics , we chose 6 bins whose positions and widths were distributed symmetrically around the median @xmath27 .",
    "atlas @xcite chose @xmath27 bins that were optimized to the bessel - gaussian distribution of @xmath27 in ultra - central collisions and whose positions and widths were asymmetric around the median @xmath27 .",
    "they then used the same asymmetric binning scheme at all collision centralities even though the @xmath22 distribution first becomes more symmetric and then again asymmetric in the opposite direction as one proceeds from ultra - central to ultra - peripheral collisions .",
    "[ f7 ] shows that , for the purpose of separating linear and nonlinear contributions to the higher - order flow harmonics the precise placement of the @xmath27 bins does not matter .",
