    ", often involves a potential term having _ singularity _ and usually some extra perturbation terms characterizing the physical system under study .",
    "almost for all practical purposes , the radial schrdinger equation to be solved requires approximations as the exact solutions can be obtained only for a few idealized cases such as the harmonic oscillator or the coulomb potential .",
    "consequently , a large number of analytical and numerical methodologies have been developed by many workers over the decades to obtain accurate solutions for such systems employing a variety of techniques .",
    "although many attractive and elegant approaches exist in the literature for both the non - singular and singular potentials , the latter remains relatively less explored as one encounters considerable difficulties and challenges because of the singularity .",
    "therefore , the search for a _ general _ scheme capable of producing accurate and reliable results , has continued to remain an active area of research .",
    "the purpose of this article is to assess the performance of a simple numerical methodology for the singular potentials .",
    "although the method would hold good for other singularities , we will restrict ourselves to two different classes of such potentials which have found applications in various branches of physics , _ viz . , _ +",
    "( a ) the harmonic potential including an inverse quartic and sextic anharmonicity , @xmath1 and + ( b ) the coulomb potential with a linear and quadratic coupling , @xmath2 in what follows we will adopt @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 for the sake of consistency with the literature .    the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pot1 ] ) is defined in @xmath9 $ ] with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "such a potential may lead to many interesting and appealing features ; both physically and mathematically .",
    "for example , there may be the so - called _",
    "klauder phenomenon_[1 - 2 ] signifying that once the singular perturbation is turned on , it can not be completely turned off .",
    "it is noticed that the effects of perturbation is never _ small _ enough to ignore .",
    "for example , the complete three - dimensional schrdinger equation is exactly solvable without the inverse sextic perturbation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pot1 ] ) for both the extreme cases @xmath10 and @xmath11 however subjecting the system to an infinitesimal perturbation @xmath12 induces such dramatic effects in the wave function near the origin that the perturbation theory fails to give _ any _ estimate at all [ 3 ] .",
    "on the other hand , when either @xmath13 or @xmath14 is large , the anharmonic terms compete with the harmonic term and none of the interacting terms can be considered negligible .",
    "several methods are available for the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this potential .",
    "some of them , for example , include the _ singular _ perturbation theory [ 4 - 6 ] specially designed for this potential , variational methods [ 7,8 ] , step - by - step analytic continuation method [ 9 ] , numerical solution using finite - difference scheme [ 10,11 ] or the b spline techniques [ 12 ] , etc .",
    "this potential also has the importance in the context of conditional exact solvability ; in other words , exact analytic solutions can be obtained for some severely restricted set of parameters ( related to each other through some special relations ) for ground states [ 13 ] or excited states [ 14,15 ] .    the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pot2 ] ) also has many relevance to physics .",
    "thus , the coulomb plus the linear potential has been studied extensively for the spherical stark effects in hydrogenic atoms [ 16 ] , or in connection with the various non - relativistic quark confinement and other similar problems in particle physics [ 16 - 18 ] , etc . on the other hand , the coulomb plus",
    "the quadratic potential has been studied in the context of quadratic zeeman effects in hydrogenic atoms [ 19 ] , or in plasma physics [ 20 ] , etc .",
    "again various methodologies have been devised for the calculation of eigenvalues of this potential by many workers .",
    "for some special values of the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 this leads to a quasi exactly solvable potential and analytic solutions can be obtained [ 21,22 ] .",
    "other works include rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation model [ 23 ] , the stieltjes moments method [ 21 ] , the analytic continued fraction theory [ 24,25 ] , the hill - determinant method [ 26 ] , the supersymmetric quantum mechanics coupled with the shifted 1/n method [ 22,27 ] , the two - point quasifractional approximant method [ 28 ] , etc .",
    "more references on this potential can be found in [ 28 ] .",
    "however , for both these potentials , good accuracy results can be achieved only by a few of the above mentioned methods . thus leaving aside a few methods , ( like [ 9 ] or [ 11 ] , for example ) it is usually quite difficult to reach beyond a six- or seven - decimal place accuracy for the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pot1 ] ) for an arbitrary set of parameters . as another author [ 8 ] points out , to obtain even this much accuracy by standard numerical methods for the potential like that in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pot1 ] ) sometimes requires one to use a mesh of at least 80,000 points for some cases .",
    "also , some of these methods , although can provide good quality results for certain type of parameters , perform rather poorly or even can not provide any result at all in other occasions ( see [ 22 ] , for example ) .",
    "finally while majority of the works have remained largely focused to the ground states , relatively less attention has been paid to the excited states ( especially those associated with the higher angular momentum ) . given these facts , a general method which can offer accurate as well as reliable results for",
    "a general set of parameters for both ground and excited states ( low as well as high ) with equal ease , would be highly desirable and demanding .",
    "this work attempts to make a small step in such a direction .",
    "the seed of the motivation grew from a study of singly- and doubly- and triply excited rydberg states of many - electron atomic systems [ 29,30 ] within the density functional framework [ 31 ] using the generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) [ 32,33 ] scheme which produced good quality results within the bounds of the theory .",
    "the purpose of this article is to use this simple numerical scheme for the calculation of the above mentioned singular potentials .",
    "first we will present in brief the essentials of the gps method for the solution of the single - particle radial schrdinger equation in section ii .",
    "this has witnessed many successful applications in electronic structure and dynamics calculations in the recent years involving mainly coulomb singularities ( see , for example , [ 29 - 30 , 32 - 35 ] ) . thereafter this has been extended to some other physical systems including the spiked harmonic oscillators , the logarithmic and power potentials as well as the hulthen and yukawa potentials [ 36 - 38 ] with considerable promise .",
    "section iii presents the computed eigenvalues , wave functions , radial densities and the expectation values for the tow cases .",
    "both ground as well as higher excited states are calculated and a thorough comparison with literature data has been made , wherever possible .",
    "finally few conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "in this section , we present an overview of the generalized pseudospectral method ( gps ) employed to solve the radial eigenvalue problem with the singular potentials .",
    "a more detailed account can be found in the refs .",
    "[ 29 - 30 , 32 - 38 ] .    without loss of generality",
    ", the desired radial schrdinger equation can be written as ( atomic units employed unless otherwise mentioned ) , @xmath17 where the hamiltonian includes the usual kinetic and potential energy operators , @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pot1 ] ) or ( [ eqn : pot2 ] ) .",
    "the symbols have their usual significances .",
    "the usual finite - difference spatial discretization schemes often require a large number of grid points to achieve good accuracy since majority of these methods employ a uniform mesh ( nonuniform schemes are used in a few occasions as well , e.g. , in [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the gps method , however , can give _ nonuniform _ and optimal spatial discretization accurately .",
    "this allows one to work with a denser mesh at shorter @xmath21 regions and a coarser mesh at larger @xmath21 .",
    "additionally the gps method is computationally orders of magnitude faster than the finite - difference schemes .",
    "one of the principal features of this scheme lies in the fact that a function @xmath22 defined in the interval @xmath23 $ ] can be approximated by the polynomial @xmath24 of order n so that , @xmath25 and the approximation is _ exact _ at the _ collocation points _ @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 in this work , we have employed the legendre pseudospectral method using @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are obtainable from the roots of the first derivative of the legendre polynomial @xmath31 with respect to @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 the cardinal functions , @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) are given by the following expression , @xmath35 obeying the unique property @xmath36 .",
    "now the semi - infinite domain @xmath9 $ ] is mapped into the finite domain @xmath23 $ ] by the transformation @xmath37 .",
    "one can make use of the following algebraic nonlinear mapping , @xmath38 where l and @xmath39 may be termed as the mapping parameters .",
    "now , introducing the following relation , @xmath40 coupled with the symmetrization procedure [ 32,33 ] leads to the transformed hamiltonian as below , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is given by , @xmath43 note the advantage that this leads to a _ symmetric _ matrix eigenvalue problem which can be readily solved to give accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . for the particular transformation used in eq .",

    "the results have been reported only up to the precision that maintained stability with respect to these variations .",
    "thus for all the calculations done in this work , a consistent set for the numerical parameters ( @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) has been used which seemed to be appropriate for the current problem .",
    "in order to show the efficacy of the method , we first present some specimen results for a few odd- and even - parity high excited states of the pure three - dimensional quartic oscillator corresponding to the large vibrational quantum numbers @xmath53 and the angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath54 ( these two quantum numbers must have the same parity ) .",
    "this was chosen because it has been quite extensively investigated by many authors over a long period and fairly accurate results are available making it amenable to easy comparison . at this point , it may be noted that all the results reported in this and all other subsequent tables throughout this article , have been _ truncated _ and not _ rounded - off_. therefore all the entries in the tables are to be taken as correct up to the place they are reported .",
    "the results used for comparison in table  [ tab : table1 ] are chronologically : ( a ) the linear variation method involving diagonalization of matrices of large order ( @xmath55 ) [ 39 ] , ( b ) the analytical formula based on the scaled oscillator approach [ 40 ] , ( c ) the finite - difference calculation [ 10 ] and ( d ) the asymptotic shooting method [ 41 ] .",
    "as seen , the present result for all these states match exactly up to the 9th decimal place with the accurate results of [ 41 ] , demonstrating that higher excited states can be obtained fairly accurately and reliably .",

    "_ states are obtained .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that some of the methods employed for these kind of potentials in the literature often have the unwanted feature of producing unphysical roots , e.g. , the ricatti - pad scheme for a class of singular potentials , commonly termed as spiked oscillators . on the other hand , existence of false ( unphysical ) eigenvalues in the hill - determinant method for a perturbed oscillator or perturbed coulomb potential has been suggested by some authors on mathematical grounds .",
    "later it was pointed out [ 43 ] that these unphysical or false states manifest themselves by having the negative values for @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "some of the well - known methods have another undesirable feature that they give poor or erroneous results for potentials having multiple wells , for certain parameter sets or sometimes even for certain states within a particular parameter set . as an example , the shifted 1/n method for the perturbed coulomb potential [ 22 ] fails to give any result when any four of the five quantities @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xmath68 are kept fixed and only the fifth one is varied .",
    "the present method is _ general _ in the sense that it is applicable to a wide spectrum of parameters without requiring any special relation among them , irrespective of the strength of the coupling involved and therefore lifts any such restrictions . in view of the simplicity and accuracy offered by this method for the polynomial as well as the singular potentials considered in this work for both ground and higher excited states",
    ", it may be hoped that this prescription may be useful for a wide range of other similar potentials of interest . thus other singular potentials having higher order terms in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) or ( 2 ) or the nonsingular polynomial potentials with higher order anharmonicities like quartic , sextic , octic , etc . , may as well be treated by this method very well .",
    "finally , we mention that while practically all of the common methodologies in quantum mechanics for such systems involve the solution of the time - independent schrdinger equation , recently a time - dependent ( td ) formalism [ 44 - 47 ] has been proposed as well for the accurate calculation of static properties , which is , in principle , exact .",
    "applications have been made for the ground and excited states of double well and anharmonic oscillators having higher order terms , multiple - well and self - interacting oscillators in one dimension [ 44 - 46 ] , as well as the ground - state electronic properties of noble gas atoms [ 47 ] through an amalgamation of the density functional and quantum fluid dynamical treatment .",
    "it may be worthwhile to study the performance of such td methods for the singular potentials dealt in this work .",
    "an _ accurate _ and _ simple _ methodology has been proposed for certain singular potentials employing the generalized pseudospectral method .",
    "the prescription is _ general _ and _ reliable_. the energies , densities and expectation values presented for ground and excited states of the ( i ) harmonic potential with inverse quartic and sextic perturbation and ( ii ) the perturbed coulomb potential with linear and quadratic terms are reported for a broad spectrum of potential parameters .",
    "this scheme is capable of producing very good quality results for both ground and higher excited states .",
    "the @xmath69 states corresponding to the angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath70 for the pure three dimensional quartic oscillator illustrates this fact .",
    "many states have been reported here for the first time which might constitute a useful set for future referencing .",
