    "the effect of an external magnetic field on the quantum properties of the 1d antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin-@xmath0 model has attracted much interest in recent years .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies of this system have revealed a plethora of quantum fluctuation phenomena , not usually observed in higher dimensions .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model in a uniform magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) on a periodic chain of @xmath3 sites is given by @xmath4,\\label{hamiltonian1}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the exchange coupling and @xmath1 is a uniform magnetic field .",
    "theoretically , in the absence of the external magnetic field , @xmath2 , the exact solution is given by the bethe ansatz@xcite .",
    "the spectrum is gapless and in the ground state , the system is in the luttinger liquid phase , where the decay of correlations follow a power law . when a uniform magnetic field is applied the spectrum of the system",
    "remains gapless until the critical field @xmath6 . here a phase transition of the pokrovsky - talapov type@xcite occurs and the ground state becomes a complete ordered ferromagnetic state@xcite .",
    "the progress in the experimental front is achived by introduction of high - field neutron scattering studies and synthesis of magnetic quasi - one dimensional systems . in many cases",
    "experimental data deviate significantly from the theoretical predictions based on the pure isotropic af heisenberg model in the uniform magnetic field@xcite .",
    "these deviations are due to anisotropies , most notably the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) anisotropy@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is written as @xmath7,\\label{hamiltonian2}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the dm vector and the direction of this vector will be chosen along the @xmath9 axis , @xmath10 . in actual systems ,",
    "the direction of the @xmath8 vector is fixed by the microscopic arrangement of atoms and orbitals . since the dm interaction breaks the fundamental su(2 ) symmetry of the isotropic heisenberg interactions , it is at the origin of many deviations from pure heisenberg behavior .",
    "such anisotropy induces qualitatively different effects .",
    "in particular , in the 1d af spin-@xmath0 model with the dm interaction a gap is opened in the energy spectrum and scales as @xmath11 in contrast with the pure heisenberg case ( eq.([hamiltonian1 ] ) ) . theoretically , using bosonization techniques",
    "oshikawa and affleck@xcite explained the observed scaling behavior of the energy gap .",
    "they have shown that in the presence of the staggered dm interaction along the chain , an applied uniform field @xmath12 also generates an effective staggered magnetic field @xmath13 .",
    "the staggered magnetic field for @xmath2 produces an af ordered ( neel order ) ground state and induces a gap in the spectrum of the model it is scaled as @xmath14 .    for the higher - dimensional cases",
    "there is a theoretical expectation@xcite that the field dependence of one of the gaps should be @xmath15 .",
    "fouet et al .",
    "also studied@xcite the gap - induced by the staggered magnetic field at the saturation uniform field @xmath6 .",
    "using field theoretical arguments and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method , they found that the gap scales as @xmath16 . in a very recent work ,",
    "this scaling behavior is clarified by using exact diagonalization lanczos results@xcite .",
    "also , it was shown that in the case of the 2d frustrated dimer singlet spin systems , a magnetic field induces staggered magnetization@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , most of the studies have excluded from consideration the quantum effects associated with the dm interaction@xcite . in a recent work@xcite ,",
    "the effect of an external magnetic field on the 2d af heisenberg model with dm interaction is studied .",
    "the dependence of the quantum corrections on the dm interaction is investigated .",
    "it is shown that the effect of the external field on the gap can be predicted by investigating the on - site magnetization of the model .",
    "on the other hand , the interplay of dm interactions and an external magnetic field in spin-@xmath0 dimers is studied@xcite .",
    "it is shown that the staggered magnetization of an isolated dimer has a maximum close to one - half the polarization , with a large maximal value of @xmath17 in the limit of very small dm interaction .",
    "they have also investigated the effect of the inter - dimer coupling in the context of ladders with dmrg calculations .",
    "however the interply of the dm interaction on the ground state properties of the 1d af spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model is much less studied . since the integrability of the model will be lost in the presence of the dm interaction , very intensive studies are needed .",
    "plotted as a function of the dm vector @xmath18 .",
    "the results reported for different chain lengths @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the inset , the value of the staggered chiral correlation function @xmath21 is shown versus @xmath18 for the pure dm interaction ( @xmath2 and @xmath22 ) and chain length @xmath23 . ,",
    "width=302 ]    in this paper , we present our numerical results obtained on the low - energy states of the 1d af spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model with the staggered dm interaction ( @xmath18 ) in an external uniform magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we study the mutual effect of a uniform magnetic field and dm interaction on the ground state phase diagram of the model .",
    "in particular , we apply the modified lanczos method to diagonalize numerically finite chains . using the exact diagonalization results",
    ", we calculate the spin gap , the magnetization , the staggered magnetization , the staggered chirality and various spin - structure factors as a function of the uniform magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) and dm interaction ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "based on the exact diagonalization results , we obtain the ground state magnetic phase diagram of the model showing the luttinger liquid , the staggered chiral , the spin - flop , and the ferromagnetic phases .",
    "we denote by `` ferromagnetic phase '' the phase with the magnetization parallel to the external magnetic field as only nonvanishing order parameter .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section ii we present our numerical results of the exact diagonalization calculations on the ground state properties of the af heisenberg chain with the dm interaction . in section iii",
    "we investigate the effect of a uniform magnetic field on the ground state properties of the model .",
    "finally we conclude and summarize our results in section iv .",
    "in this section we explain the behavior of the model in the absence of the uniform magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "classically , the effect of a staggered dm interaction is interesting .",
    "the dm interaction makes it energetically favorable for the spins to stay in the plane perpendicular to the direction of @xmath8 ( @xmath24-@xmath25 plane ) . without the @xmath26 term ,",
    "the dm interaction makes the spins in different sublattices to be under a @xmath27 angle to each other .",
    "thus at @xmath2 , in the ground state of the model ( 2 ) spins lie in the @xmath24-@xmath25 plane ( easy plane ) .    on the other hand , nersesyan et.al .",
    "predicted@xcite that in the anisotropyc ( easy - plane ) af spin-@xmath0 chain with sufficiently strong frustrating next - nearest - neighbor coupling , a phase with a broken parity appears , which is characterized by the nonzero value of the chirality @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes ( @xmath30 ) and the notation @xmath31 represent the expectation value at the lowest energy state .",
    "however , two different types of the chiral ordered phases , gapped and gapless were found@xcite . in order to explore the nature of the spectrum and the ground state phase diagram of the model",
    ", we have used the modified lanczos method@xcite to diagonalize numerically finite ( @xmath32 ) chains .",
    "the energies of the few lowest eigenstates were obtained for chains with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have calculated numerically the staggered chiral order parameter @xmath33 and the staggered chiral correlation function defined as @xmath34 lanczos results lead to @xmath35 for any value of the dm vector @xmath18 , because in a finite system no symmetry breaking happens . in fig.1 we have plotted the staggered chiral correlation function along the @xmath36 axis , @xmath21 , as a function of dm vector @xmath18 for different chain lengths @xmath19 . as can clearly be seen , the staggered chiral correlation function @xmath21 , increases with increasing @xmath18 , which shows that the dm interaction suppresses the quantum fluctuations in the @xmath24-@xmath25 plane and induces a staggered chiral phase in the ground state phase diagram of the model . introducing a dm interaction , the su(2 ) rotational symmetry breaks and a quantum phase transition happens in the ground state phase diagram of the model .",
    "it is important to note that due to the profound effect of quantum fluctuations the chirality does not saturate .",
    "we have also checked the excitation energies of the three lowest levels as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "we have considered the excitation gap in the system as the difference between the first excited state and the ground state .",
    "we have found that a gap opens in the presence of the dm vector @xmath18 . in the inset of fig.1",
    ", the staggered chiral correlation function @xmath21 has been plotted as a function of @xmath18 for the pure dm interaction ( @xmath2 and @xmath22 ) and chain length @xmath23 .",
    "it shows that in the absence of heisenberg interaction ( @xmath22 ) and zeeman term ( @xmath2 ) , the staggered chiral order is governed by @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in the absence of a dm interaction , the ground state of the system is in the gapless luttinger liquid phase with a power - low decay of correlations . adding a dm interaction to the isotropic heisenberg model develops a gap .",
    "the ground state then has the long - range staggered chiral order in the @xmath9 direction .     as a function of applied magnetic field @xmath1 for @xmath23 chain for different values of the anisotropy dm vector @xmath38 .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is considered.,width=302 ]",
    "in this section we study the effect of a uniform magnetic field on the ground state phase diagram of the 1d af spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model with dm interaction . as we mentioned , in the absence of the uniform magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) and dm interaction ( @xmath40 ) , the spectrum is gapless .",
    "the ground state is in the luttinger liquid phase . by applying a uniform magnetic field @xmath1 , the su(2 ) symmetry of the pure heisenberg model",
    "reduces to a u(1 ) symmetry corresponding to a rotation around the magnetic field direction ( @xmath24 axis ) .",
    "the spectrum remains gapless until a critical saturation field @xmath6 .",
    "as soon as a staggered dm interaction with a @xmath8 vectore not parallel to the uniform magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) is introduced , the rotational symmetry in spin space is completely lost .",
    "the only symmetry that remains is the mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath24-@xmath9 plane ( the plane contaning the uniform magnetic field and the @xmath8 vector ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the staggered magnetization per site must lie in the @xmath25 direction ( the direction perpendicular to the plane defined by the uniform magnetic field and the @xmath8 vector ) , while the uniform magnetization per site is in the field direction .",
    "if the @xmath8 vector is parallel to the uniform magnetic field , the u(1 ) rotational symmetry is still present .",
    "thus , the staggered magnetization is identically zero . in following",
    "we show that the quantum phase transitions can be easily observed from the numerical calculations of the small systems .",
    "the symmetry breaking considerations suggest that an insight into the nature of different phases can be obtained by studying the magnetization @xmath41 and the staggered magnetization @xmath42 and the spin correlation functions",
    ". the static spin structure factor at momentum @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44     axis , @xmath45 as a function of applied magnetic field @xmath1 for @xmath23 chain for different values of the anisotropy dm vector @xmath46 .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is considered.,width=302 ]    it is known that the spin structure factors give us deeper insight into the characteristics of the ground state .",
    "in particular we study the @xmath1-dependence and @xmath18-dependence of different spin stucture factors .",
    "to determine the properties of this model in different sectors of the ground state phase diagram we have implemented the lanczos algorithm of the finite chains @xmath32 to calculate the lowest energy state .",
    "we have computed the ground state for different values of the dm vector @xmath47 . in fig.2",
    "we have plotted the magnetization along the applied uniform field , @xmath48 versus @xmath1 for chain length @xmath23 and different values of the anisotropy @xmath18 .",
    "it can be seen , that for the @xmath40 , due to the effect of the quantum fluctuations in finite sizes the magnetization remains zero for smal values of the uniform magnetic field @xmath1 . for",
    "@xmath49 the magnetization saturate .",
    "this is in agreement with results obtained within theoretical approaches . due to the quantum fluctuations , in the presence of @xmath18",
    "there is no sharp transition to the saturation value of the magnetization . when @xmath50 , the magnetization develops as soon as the magnetic field is swiched on , only reaching saturation asymptotically in the limit of infinite field .",
    "we mensioned that at the @xmath2 the staggered dm interaction causes the spins stay in the @xmath24-@xmath25 plane . in this case , the effect of the uniform magnetic field decreases the degeneracy of the ground state energy .",

    "the results reported for a chain length @xmath23.,width=302 ]    in fig.3 we have also plotted the staggered magnetization along the @xmath25 axis @xmath45 , as a function of the uniform magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "the results reported for a chain length @xmath23 and different dm vectors @xmath46 .",
    "it shows in complete agreement with the theoretical results of the effective hamiltonian@xcite and symmetry breaking considerations , by applying a uniform field @xmath1 , a profound neel order in the @xmath25 direction induces . which shows that there is long range spin - flop order along @xmath25 axis .",
    "the oscilations of @xmath45 at finite @xmath3 for smal values of dm vector @xmath18 , are the result of level crossing between ground state and excited states of the model .",
    "there is also a maximal value for the staggered magnetization per site , around @xmath53 .",
    "this value is of the order of the maximal value of the isolated dimer , and it depends relatively weakly on @xmath18 .",
    "the inset of fig.3 shows the staggered magnetization along the @xmath54 axis versus the uniform magnetic field @xmath1 at dm vector @xmath55 and different chain lengths @xmath56 .",
    "it can be seen that the maximal value of the staggered magnetization is independent of the system size .",
    "on the other hand , we have also investigated , @xmath57 as a function of the uniform field @xmath1 for different dm vectors .",
    "we have found that , there is a trend toward staggered magnetization along @xmath54 axis for @xmath58 .",
    "which confirms that the ground state of the model has the neel long range order along the @xmath54 axis , which is known as the spin - flop phase .     heisenberg model with dm interaction in an external uniform magnetic field ( @xmath1).,width=302 ]",
    "an additional insight into the nature of different phases can be investigated by studying the staggered chiral correlation function @xmath21 . in this case",
    "we study the magnetic field dependence of the function @xmath21 for several values of the dm vector . in fig.4a",
    "we have shown the field dependence of the staggered chiral correlation function @xmath21 for the pure dm interaction ( @xmath22 ) and chain length @xmath23 . as we mensioned before , in the absence of the heisenberg interaction and zeeman term , the ground state of the model has the long - range staggered chiral order along the @xmath9 direction .",
    "it can be clearly seen , that the staggered chiral phase remains stable even in the presence of the uniform magnetic field less than some critical field . here",
    "a quantum phase transition occurs and the ground state becomes a completely ordered ferromagnetic state .",
    "our numerical results also show that the value of the critical field depends on the dm interaction .    to obtain a complete picture of the ground state phase diagram of the model",
    ", we have also calculated the function @xmath21 for the heisenberg model with the dm interaction . in fig.4b",
    "the staggered chiral correlation function is plotted as a function of the uniform magnetic field @xmath1 for different values of the dm vector @xmath46 .",
    "the results reported for a chain length @xmath23 . as is seen from this figure , @xmath21 first increases versus the uniform magnetic field @xmath1 and after passing a maximum decreases . since the uniform magnetic field",
    "suppress the quantum fluctuations in the @xmath24 direction , thus the staggered chirality increases increases up to the saturation .",
    "however , with more increasing the magnetic field @xmath1 , the staggered chirality decreases from the saturation value in well agreement with fig.4b .",
    "also , due to the quantum fluctuations , the staggered chirality dose not reach to zero for large dm vectors .",
    "based on the symmetry analyses and numerical calculations , we expect that the ground state phase diagram of the model ( 2 ) has been a form shown on fig.5 . here",
    "the ground state phase diagram of a 1d af spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model with the staggered dm interaction in an external uniform magnetic field , is presented on the @xmath1-@xmath18 plane .",
    "the ground state phase diagram contains , besides the gapless luttinger liquid and gapped ferromagnetic ( fm ) phases , the gapped staggered chiral and spin - flop phases .",
    "the gapped staggered chiral and spin - flop phases are realized only in the case of dm interaction ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "each phase is characterized by its own type of the long - range order : the ferromagnetic order along the magnetic field axis in the fm phase ; the neel order along the @xmath54 axis in the spin - flop phase ; and the staggered chiral order along the @xmath36 axis in the staggered chiral phase .    in principle , the dm interaction breaks the fundamental su(2 ) symmetry of the pure isotropic heisenberg interactions and also u(1 ) symmetry of the heisenberg model in the presence of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the only symmetry that remains is the mirror symmetry with respect to the plane containing the uniform magnetic field and the @xmath8 vector ( @xmath24-@xmath9 plane ) .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the ground state phase diagram of the 1d af spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model with the staggered dzyaloshinkii - moriya interaction in an external uniform magnetic field @xmath1 .",

    ", we have shown that the dm interaction induces the staggered chiral phase .",
    "we have also found that a gap opens in the spectrum of the model .",
    "thus , we have concluded that the gapped staggered chiral ordered phase appears in the ground state phase diagram of the 1d af spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model for @xmath37 .",
    "we have identified that the application of a uniform magnetic field induces a spin - flop phase in the ground state phase diagram of the model.also , the staggered chiral phase remains stable even in the presence of the uniform magnetic field .",
