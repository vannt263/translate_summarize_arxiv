    "in the framework of the qcd - improved parton model , the inclusive production of single hadrons is described by means of fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , @xmath6 .",
    "the value of @xmath6 corresponds to the probability for the parton @xmath7 produced at short distance @xmath8 to form a jet that includes the hadron @xmath9 carrying the fraction @xmath10 of the longitudinal momentum of @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not yet possible to derive the ffs from first principles , in particular for hadrons with masses smaller than or comparable to the asymptotic scale parameter , @xmath11 .",
    "however , given their @xmath10 dependence at some energy scale @xmath12 , the evolution with @xmath12 may be computed perturbatively in qcd using the timelike altarelli - parisi equations @xcite .",
    "this allows us to test qcd quantitatively within one experiment observing single hadrons at different values of centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath13 ( in the case of @xmath0 annihilation ) or transverse momentum @xmath14 ( in the case of scattering ) .",
    "moreover , the factorization theorem guarantees that the @xmath6 functions are independent of the process in which they have been determined , and represent a universal property of @xmath9 .",
    "this enables us to make quantitative predictions for other types of experiments as well .    during the last five years",
    ", the experiments at the cern large electron - positron collider ( lep1 ) and the slac linear collider ( slc ) have provided us with a wealth of high - precision information on how partons fragment into low - mass charged hadrons .",

    "this new situation motivated us to update , refine , and extend a former analysis performed by two of us together with binnewies @xcite by generating new leading - order ( lo ) and next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) sets of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ffs @xcite .",

    "these results are in perfect agreement with what the particle data group currently quotes as the world average , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "our strategy was to only include in our fits lep1 and slc data with both flavour separation and hadron identification @xcite , gluon - tagged three - jet samples with a fixed gluon - jet energy @xcite , and the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 data sets from the pre - lep1/slc era with the highest statistics and the finest binning in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "other data served us for cross checks .",
    "in particular , we probed the scaling violations in the ffs through comparisons with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 data from desy doris and petra , with cm energies between 5.4 and 34  gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we tested the gluon ff , which enters the unpolarized cross section only at nlo , by comparing our predictions for the longitudinal cross section , where it already enters at lo , with available data @xcite . finally , we directly compared our gluon ff with the one recently measured by delphi in three - jet production with gluon identification as a function of @xmath10 at various energy scales @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "all these comparisons led to rather encouraging results .",
    "we also verified that our ffs satisfy reasonably well the momentum sum rules , which we did not impose as constraints on our fits .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "on the one hand , we wish to extend our previous tests of scaling violations @xcite to higher energy scales by confronting new data on inclusive charged - hadron production in @xmath0 annihilation from lep2 @xcite , with @xmath13 ranging from 133  gev up to 189  gev , with nlo predictions based on our ffs . on the other hand , we wish to quantitatively check the universality of our ffs by making comparisons with essentially all available high - statistics data on inclusive charged - hadron production in colliding - beam experiments .",

    "however , if we estimate the theoretical uncertainty due to unknown corrections beyond nlo by varying @xmath29 between 1/2 and 2 , as is usually done , then it is justified to state that all the considered data sets agree with our nlo predictions within their errors .",
    "we hence conclude that our global analysis of inclusive charged - hadron production provides evidence that both the predicted scaling violations and the universality of the ffs are realized in nature .",
    "as is well known , the gluon ff enters the prediction for the unpolarized cross section @xmath129 of inclusive hadron production in @xmath0 annihilation only at nlo , while at lo it only contributes indirectly via the @xmath20 evolution . in order to nevertheless have a handle on it",
    ", we included in our fits @xcite experimental data on gluon - tagged three - jet events from lep1 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we checked that our predictions for the longitudinal cross section , where it already enters at lo , agree well with available data @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the gluon ff is known to play a crucial rle for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 scattering at low values of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the comparisons performed here provide another nontrivial test of the gluon ff .    as we have seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : u1a][fig : hp ] , [ fig : z ] , and [ fig : op1 ] , the theoretical uncertainty of the nlo predictions due to scale variations significantly decreases as @xmath14 increases . in order to perform more meaningful comparisons ,",
    "it would , therefore , be desirable if @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 experiments extended their measurements out to larger values of @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , in order to render such comparisons more specific , it would be useful if these experiments provided us with separate data samples of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 hadrons .",
    "we also estimated the current systematic uncertainties in the ffs by comparing our nlo predictions for flavour - tagged inclusive charged - hadron production with those obtained from two other ff sets which appeared during this year @xcite .",
    "apart from a difference in the @xmath16-quark ffs at medium to large values of @xmath10 , which may be traced to the incompatibility of two underlying @xmath16-quark - specific data samples @xcite , all three ff sets @xcite mutually agree within the present experimental errors .",
    "we conclude that the determination of nlo ffs from global fits to experimental data has reached a level of precision which is comparable to the one familiar from similar analyses for pdfs .",
