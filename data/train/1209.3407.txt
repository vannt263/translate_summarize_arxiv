    "with the advent of the integrated circuits technology , the components of the classical computer become smaller and smaller and inevitably quantum effects such as quantum interference have to be met . due to these quantum effects",
    ", the usual ( classical ) computing technology might be invalid and computation based on the quantum laws opens a new chapter to overcome the limits of classical computing  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that quantum computation could solve effectively certain problems ( e.g. , factoring large numbers  @xcite and searching databases  @xcite ) , which could not be solved by classical algorithms .",
    "different from the bits in classical computer , the qubits in a quantum computer are made by the controlled two - level quantum systems and could be prepared at the superpositions of their basis states  @xcite .",
    "therefore , quantum computer provides an automatically - parallel computing and thus is much more powerful than the classical computer .",
    "basically , the central task for quantum computing is to coherently control the transitions between the quantum logic states for implementing various gate operations . generally , there are two well - known approaches to realize the population transfers between two quantum states ; one makes use of the rabi oscillations and the other is based on population passages  @xcite . in the first way a constant - intensity resonant driving is applied to the two - state system , and the population of the target state can undergo a periodic variation with the rabi frequency .",
    "this implies that , by properly choosing the pulse duration @xmath1 ( such that the pulse area @xmath2 is an odd multiple of @xmath0 ) , the population of the initial state can be completely transferred into the target state .",
    "obviously , the main disadvantage of this method is that the pulse area should be precisely designed .",
    "alternatively , in the second approach the population of the initial state is transferred into the target state by utilizing various population passage techniques  @xcite .",
    "importantly , both the adiabatical and non - adiabatical passages are insensitive to the areas of the applied pulses , and thus there is no need to design the exact durations of the applied pulses . by this way , the desired quantum manipulations for quantum computing could be realized more easily , at least in principle .",
    "usually , the population passages are demonstrated by various adiabatic manipulations , owing to its relative simplicity .",
    "for example , one of the adiabatic passage technique called stark - chirped rapid adiabatic passage ( scrap ) has been attracting a lot of attention in modern atomic , molecular and optical physics  @xcite .",
    "different from the other adiabatical passages such as the stimulated raman adiabatical passage ( stirap ) , the stark shifts in the scrap caused by the external pulses are beneficial to create the desired level - crossings needed for population passages  @xcite . also , unlike the technique in stirap with the assistants of various intermediate states",
    ", the population transfers between the two selected quantum states can be directly realized by just controlling the relative intensity and delay time between the two applied pulses .",
    "therefore , the operations of scraps are relatively simple and have been utilizing in various quantum state engineerings based on population passages .",
    "certainly , the adiabatic requirement in the scrap is a fundamental hurdle for its various potential applications .",
    "under such a limit , the applied pulse operations should be sufficiently slow such that the evolution of the manipulated quantum state is adiabatic .",
    "however , the practically - existing finite decoherence time of the manipulated quantum system requires that the applied operations should be sufficiently fast such that the operations could be completed before the manipulated quantum superposed state decoheres .",
    "therefore , relaxing the adiabatic condition is useful to experimentally implement the fast population transfers for desired quantum computing .    in this paper , by making use of the evolution - time insensitivity , we propose the adiabatic and non - adiabatic population passages to implement the quantum computation with electrons floating on the liquid helium .",
    "in fact , since the pioneer work of platzman and dykman  @xcite , electrons floating on the liquid helium have been served as one of the most hopeful candidates for implementing quantum computation . in particular , due to the significantly long decoherence time ( e.g. , estimated as @xmath3ms for the electronic qubit and @xmath4s for spin qubit  @xcite ) and the scalability , quantum manipulations of surface - state electrons on liquid helium have attracted much attention in recent years  @xcite . note that , until now , almost all the proposals for quantum manipulations of surface - state electrons on liquid helium are based on the usual rabi oscillation scheme , wherein the applied pulses should be exactly designed to implement the desired quantum gate operations . given that the precise designs of all the applied pluses ( e.g. , control the always - on inter - electron coulomb interactions for implementing the tunable two - qubit operation ) are not practically easy , here we propose an alternative approach to implement the fundamental quantum logic operations by population passages , wherein the durations of the applied pulses are not required to be _",
    "precisely _ designed . in our proposal",
    "two pulses , one to chirp the qubit state and one to drive the transition between the qubit states , are enough to deterministically transfer the populations from one logic state to the other . as a consequence , quantum logic gates with the surface - state electrons on liquid helium can be implemented in a evolution - time insensitive way by a pair of passage pulses .",
    "we believe that the proposal could be realized experimentally , once the single - quantum manipulations of surface - state electrons are experimental demonstrated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the previous scheme of quantum computation with electrons floating on liquid helium by using the evolution - time sensitive pulses ( such as rabi oscillations ) .",
    "our approach to implement the quantum logic gates with these surface - state electrons by adiabatic and nonadiabatic passages are introduced in secs .",
    "iii and iv , respectively .",
    "finally , we end with some discussions in sec . v.",
    "a typical experimental geometry of one electron being trapped above the liquid helium is shown schematically in fig .  1 . here ,",
    "the electron is sufficiently isolated from the outside world , and just influenced by the irregularities of the liquid helium surface .",
    "as the electron emerges in the vacuum over the liquid helium surface , it will be attracted towards the surface by the image - attractive force . with a few angstroms of the surface ,",
    "the electron encounters a strong repulsive barrier along the @xmath5-direction ( arising from the pauli exclusion principle ) , which prevents the electron from penetrating into the liquid helium .",
    "the potential well , formed by the sum of the image potential and the repulsive barrier , supports a series of bound electronic states which are very similar to those in the hydrogen atom .",
    "mathematically , such a 1d hydrogen - atom - like potential takes the form  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath5 is the coordinate of the electron perpendicular to the interface and @xmath7 the charge of the electron .",
    "the coefficient @xmath8 is @xmath9 \\cong 0.0069 $ ] with a helium dielectric constant of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the height of the repulsive barrier @xmath11 has been measured to be approximately @xmath12  @xcite , which is a sufficiently - strong obstacle such that the electron can not drop into the liquid helium . therefore , the hamiltonian of a single electron floating on the surface of liquid helium can be simply written as @xmath13 by the usual finite difference method , we numerically solve the the relevant spectrum problem related to the hamiltonian and find that the ground state and the lower two excited state energies are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the qubit is encoded by the two lower states with the energy - splitting @xmath17 .",
    "the lower four states and their corresponding wavefunctions are shown in fig .",
    "certainly , the energy - splittings of these bound states can be controlled by the stark field applied normally to the surface  @xcite .          the most popular approach to implement the population transfer between the selected qubit s states is by using the rabi oscillations , i.e. , the population of one qubit s state undergoes a sinusoidal variation . here",
    ", the quantum transition between the qubit s states is induced by applying a resonant driving field  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the driven qubit reads @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the transition frequency of the qubit and @xmath20 the controllable coupling between the qubit states ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the pauli operators , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for the resonant driving field @xmath25 ,",
    "the induced coupling between the qubit s states takes the form @xmath26 , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the rabi frequency .",
    "also , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the amplitude of the applied pulse and the matrix element of the electric dipole moment respectively .    in the interaction picture defined by the unitary transformation @xmath31 $ ] , eq .",
    "can be transformed to the form @xmath32 formally , the time - evolution operator corresponding to this hamiltonian reads @xmath33 with @xmath34 is the area of the pulse and @xmath35 an unit matrix .",
    "obviously , if the qubit is initially prepared in the @xmath36 state , then after a time @xmath37 the qubit will evolve into the @xmath38 state with a probability @xmath39/2 $ ] .",
    "therefore , in order to realize the complete inversion of the population , the applied pulse must be precisely designed as a @xmath0-pulse .",
    "also , a precise `` @xmath40-pulse '' is required to prepare the superposition state @xmath41 .",
    "a significant progress in quantum computing is to achieve the single - qubit gate and the two - qubit gate . for the present system",
    "the implementation of the desired two - qubit gate is not easy , as the interbit coupling is always - on  @xcite .",
    "indeed , due to the always - on coulomb interaction , the hamiltonian of two nearest - neighbor electrons moving along the @xmath5 direction can be well approximated as @xmath42 the coulomb interaction between the electrons not only affects the state - dependent shift of the energy of the neighbor electron but also allows the resonant energy transfer from one electron to the other  @xcite . in the computational basis , the hamiltonian of the system can be rewritten as @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 in the above , @xmath46 is the transition frequency of the lower two levels referring to the @xmath47th electron , @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath50 ; and @xmath51 and @xmath52 here , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the matrix elements @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , respectively . in the interaction picture defined by the unitary @xmath59}$ ] with @xmath60 ,",

    "this is a typical two - qubit i - swap gate .",
    "with such an universal gate , assisted by arbitrary rotations of single qubits , any quantum computing network could be constructed  @xcite .",
    "if the two - qubit system is prepared beforehand in a pure state @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) , then under the i - swap gate operation , the state will evolve to @xmath68 ( or @xmath69 ) . again , the population inversion : @xmath70 .    in principle , quantum computation with surface - state electrons on liquid helium can be implemented with the above universal gates . however , for implementing these gates the evolution times of the system should be exactly set .",
    "any deviation of the desired duration will decrease the fidelity of the expectable gate . in the followings sections",
    ", we will show that the above quantum gates could be implemented by using various evolution - time insensitive quantum operations whose durations are not required to be exactly set .",
    "usually , the general logic gates in quantum computation are realized by precisely designed resonant pulses . as it has been mentioned above , in order to perform a one - qubit gate with an electron floating on liquid helium , an exactly designed @xmath0-pulse should be applied . however , due to the various fluctuations and operational imperfections occuring in practice , it is not easy to precisely design the applied pulses with exact durations .",
    "therefore , implementing quantum logic gates insensitive to evolution time is highly desirable in our context . in 2008 , wei et .",
    "@xcite proposed such an approach by using the stark - chirped rapid adiabatic passage ( scpap ) technique . in this approach the dynamical stark shift , induced by the applied pulse ,",
    "is utilized to produce the required detuning chirp(s ) of the qubit(s ) , and the usual rabi pulse is used to drive the quantum transition between the qubit s states .",
    "once the orders of the applied pulses are properly set , the population of one qubit s states can be deterministically passaged to the other . as a consequence",
    ", the desired quantum gate is implemented .",
    "the basic idea of the scpap is briefly reviewed as follows .",
    "generally , the time - dependent hamiltonian of the driven two - level system under the applied stark - chirped and rabi pulses , @xmath71 and @xmath20 , reads @xmath72 in the interaction picture , this hamiltonian reduces to @xmath73 with @xmath29@xmath74@xmath75 and @xmath76@xmath74@xmath77/2 $ ] . by solving the instantaneous eigenvalue equation of the hamiltonian ( 13 ) ,",
    "one obtains the eigenvalues : @xmath78/2 $ ] , and the relevant eigenvectors : @xmath79 if the rate of the change of the hamiltonian is slow enough , the so - called adiabatic condition , @xmath80^{3/2}}\\ll 1 \\label{beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is satisfied , the system will stay at its instantaneous eigenstate . and",
    ", there is no transition between the two instantaneous eigenstates @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that the system exists two independent adiabatic passages defined by its two instantaneous eigenstates .",
    "if the system is initially prepared at one of the adiabatic states , it stays at this state during the adiabatic evolution but the populations of a diabatic basis @xmath36 and @xmath38 could be changed .",
    "therefore , if the order of the applied pulses is right , the population of one state can be completely passaged to that of another state .",
    "certainly , the relative phase of the computational basis depends on the evolution time .",
    "but , such a relative phase shift gate , which is sufficiently produced by the stark pulse , can be written as @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "this phase shift gate implies the evolution : @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the applied stark pulse just changes the phase accumulation of the qubit state @xmath38 , but does not destroy the population distribution between the states @xmath36 and @xmath38 .",
    "obviously , the above adiabatic passage could be used to implement the desired single - qubit quantum gates  @xcite for quantum computing .",
    "of course , if the population transfer between the qubit states is not partial ( but not completely inversion ) , then the population can be controllably distributed at the qubit s states . as a consequence ,",
    "the relevant superposition of the states @xmath36 and @xmath38 can be obtained .      in the sec .",
    "ii , we have shown that @xmath5-directional motion of an electron , trapped on the surface of liquid helium , could be effectively treated as hydrogenic - like atom .",
    "therefore , the two lower states , @xmath36 and @xmath38 , could be utilized to encode a qubit for storing quantum information . in order to perform the single - qubit with such a surface - state electron by using the scrap introduced previously",

    "is induced by the applying a @xmath96-electric field to the electrode beneath the helium surface .",
    "of course , the field induced by the electrode will both affect parallel and vertical motion of the electron to the surface .",
    "however , the parallel motion is just a harmonic oscillator and the oscillation frequency ( @xmath97 ) is sufficiently weak , and thus can be effectively neglected ( compared with the transition frequency of the qubit : @xmath98 ) . actually , the two pulses applied to implement the qubit operation can both generate the stark shifts and also couple the two states of the qubit .",
    "however , in the interaction picture and under the usual rotating - wave approximation , the stark shift induced by the pump pulse can be effectively ignored ( compared with that induced by the dc pulse ) , and also that coupling induced by the dc pulse is negligible ( compared with that induced by the applied pump pulse ) .    under the unitary transformation @xmath99 , defined in the interaction picture , the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .     and @xmath107 . with this pulse sequence and @xmath108",

    "indeed , in the adiabatic basis : @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the hamiltonian of the present driven qubit can be rewritten as @xmath178 obviously , the non - diagonal elements are not zero , and thus the populations of the two adiabatic states ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) are oscillating before the desired passages finish .      to implement the two - qubit i - swap gate , we need to achieve the @xmath40-rotation between the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "6(b ) shows clearly that , if the proper amplitude - adjustable @xmath96 micro - field is applied to the second electron , the desired @xmath169-swap gate can be implemented non - adiabatically .",
    "the relevant adiabatic parameter is @xmath182 , and the time interval for realizing such a gate is shortened to @xmath183 ns ( which is significantly shorter than @xmath149ns for the precious adiabatic passage . )",
    "furthermore , by designing the proper non - adiabatic passage the two - qubit bell state ( the maximal entangled one of the two - qubit system ) can be fast generated deterministically .",

    "indeed , in the subspace spanned by the states @xmath66 and @xmath66 , the evolution of the system can be generally expressed as @xmath186 where @xmath187 and @xmath188 are the probabilistic amplitudes .",
    "thus , the reduced density matrix in this subspace reads @xmath189 suppose that the system is initially prepared in the state @xmath66 , then the corresponding probability amplitudes ( at any time @xmath37 ) are @xmath190\\cos[\\beta(t)]-i\\sin[\\alpha(t)]\\sin[\\beta(t)]\\}\\exp{(i\\gamma)}$ ] and @xmath191\\cos[\\beta(t ) ] -\\cos[\\alpha(t)]\\sin[\\beta(t)]\\}\\exp{(i\\gamma)}$ ] .",

    "this indicates that the superposition of the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( deterministically generated by the above non - adiabatic population passages ) is coherent .",
    "in summary , we have investigated how to implement the single- and two - qubit gates by using the population passage technique .",
    "we have shown that the deterministic populations transfers between the selected quantum states can be achieved by applying either adiabatic or non - adiabatic pulses to the qubit(s ) .",
    "it is emphasized that , differing from the approach to implement the quantum gates by using precisely - designed pulses with exact durations , the quantum gates implemented by the present population transfers are insensitive to the durations of the applied pulses , whatever the relevant evolutions are adiabatic or not . for the adiabatic passages the driven qubit(s )",

    "this is important to robustly overcome the decoherence existed in the realistic systems . with the proposed non - adiabatic passage technique",
    ", we have also shown that the bell state could be deterministically generated .",
    "our generic proposal is demonstrated specifically with the surface - state electrons on the liquid helium  @xcite .",
    "this system possesses several important advantageous features , e.g. , it could be conveniently manipulated by the electrodes beneath the helium surface , the system could be easily fabricated and integrated , and the qubit(s ) can be simply addressed and read out , etc .. particularly , the surface - state electrons on the liquid helium possess the sufficiently - long coherence times . for example",
    ", it can reach to @xmath194 at @xmath195 . while , the durations of the proposed adiabatic passages to implemented the desired single - qubit and two - qubit operations are just @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , if the non - adiabatic passages are applied , durations of @xmath198 and @xmath196 are enough to realize the single - qubit and two - qubit gates , respectively .",
