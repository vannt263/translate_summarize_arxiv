    "gas flows can be classified into different regimes based on the knudsen number ( kn ) , which is defined as the ratio of the mean free path of the gas to the physical characteristic length . for flows with @xmath1 ,",
    "non - equilibrium effects become important and the classical navier - stokes - fourier ( nsf ) equations fail to describe such effects @xcite . the boltzmann equation can serve as a fundamental equation that is valid for the whole range of knudsen number .",
    "there are mainly two types of numerical approaches for solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "the first one is the widely used direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method @xcite , which is the prevailing technique for simulation of high - speed rarefied gas flows .",
    "however , in dsmc the particle transport and collision processes are decoupled , and the cell size and time step are required to be smaller than the mean free path and the particle collision time , respectively . for flows in near continuum or continuum flow regime , this requirement will lead to enormous computational costs .",
    "another undesired feature of the dsmc is the statistical noise that must be reduced with time consuming sampling and averaging , which will lead to even larger computational costs for low speed flows and transient problems @xcite .",
    "it is noted that some efforts have been devoted to reduce statistical noise of the dsmc methods @xcite . the second approach is to solve the boltzmann equation directly using deterministic numerical schemes .",
    "the most popular one of this type is the discrete velocity method ( dvm ) or discrete ordinate method ( dom ) @xcite , in which the velocity space is discretized into a finite set of discrete velocities and the same operator splitting technique as dsmc is employed to solve the discrete - velocity kinetic equation @xcite .",
    "therefore , these methods face the same constraints on time - step and cell - size as the dsmc for the continuum and near - continuum flows . recently ,",
    "some asymptotic preserving ( ap ) schemes have been proposed in order to overcome these disadvantages ( _ e.g. , _ ) .",
    "these schemes have been shown to be able to recover the euler solutions in the continuum limit , but it is still not clear whether the navier - stokes solutions can be obtained .",
    "recently , a unified gas kinetic scheme ( ugks ) in finite - volume formulation was constructed for all knudsen number flows @xcite . unlike the traditional dom or dvm , the particle transport and collision are considered simultaneously in ugks in the update of the discrete distribution function . consequently , the restriction on the cell size and time step is avoided .",
    "therefore , ugks can be used to simulate entire knudsen number flows efficiently @xcite .    a novel discrete unified gas kinetic scheme ( dugks ) for multi - regime flows",
    "was proposed recently @xcite , which shares the same modeling mechanism as the original ugks @xcite .",
    "the main difference lies in the reconstruction of the discrete distribution function at cell - interface . in ugks",
    ", the time - dependent interface distribution function is determined from the local integral solution of the kinetic equation , while in dugks , the distribution function at the half time step is determined from a characteristic solution of kinetic equation .",
    "this reconstruction includes the coupled effects of particle transport and collision , and makes the updating rule much simplified in comparison with the ugks .    in previous works @xcite",
    ", the dugks has been applied to both low speed and high speed non - equilibrium flows based on structured meshes . to further demonstrate the potential applications of the dugks for practical problems involving complex geometrics or large flow gradients , in this work we will extend the dugks to arbitrary unstructured meshes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as following . in sec .",
    "2 the general procedure of the dugks on unstructured meshes is presented . in sec .",
    "3 , several numerical examples , including the micro cavity flow , an expansion flow between two connected cavities , and the rarefied gas flow past a circular cylinder , are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the current method in simulating flows at or covering different regimes .",

    "linear reconstruction and gradient limiter are employed in the reconstruction to attain the second - order accuracy .",
    "the performance of the dugks on unstructured meshes has been explored by several examples covering different flow regimes from low speed microflows to hypersonic rarefied flows . in the transitional and slip regimes ,",
    "good agreements between the results of current scheme and the dsmc solutions are observed ; in the continuum regime , the dugks results obtained on a coarse mesh without resolving the mean free path agree with the benchmark solution based on the navier - stokes equations very well .",
    "thus the ap property of the dugks for the navier - stokes limit is demonstrated .",
    "the merit of this property is important for a multicale unsteady gas expansion problem that involves both continuum and rarefied regions . as the mesh size in the continuum region can be much larger than the mean free path scale",
    ", the overall computational cost for dugks can be largely reduced in comparison with the dsmc method and the traditional dvm .",
    "since the dugks is a direct modeling multiscale method @xcite method , with the mesh size and time step being a few times of particle mean free path and collision , the physical solutions are not sensitive to individual particle collision .",
    "the dugks based on kinetic model equation can be faithfully used in real engineering applications .",
