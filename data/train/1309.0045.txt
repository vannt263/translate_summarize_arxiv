    "despite enormous advances in precision measurements of various global quantities of giant planets in our solar system ( mass , radius , rotation rate , gravitational moments , oblateness , etc . ) , our knowledge of the interior structure of these planets is rather limited .",
    "one uncertainty is the size of the central core , with estimates in the range of @xmath0 ( guillot 2005 ) and @xmath1 ( militzer et al .",
    "2008 ) for jupiter , and @xmath2 ( guillot 2005 ) for saturn .",
    "another uncertainty concerns the mixing and possible stratification of heavy elements in the core and fluid envelope ( stevenson 1985 ; leconte & chabrier 2012 )    global seismology is a promising technique for probing the internal structures of stars and planets .",
    "indeed , the internal structure of the earth , moon , sun , and numerous types of stars has been constrained primarily via measurements of global oscillations ( see unno et al .",
    "1989 for stellar oscillations , dahlen & tromp 1998 , hereafter dt98 , for a comprehensive description of the techniques of earth seismology , and chaplin & miglio 2013 a review of recent developments in asteroseismology ) .",
    "unfortunately , direct detection of global oscillations in giant planets is extremely difficult because the oscillations produce negligible luminosity perturbations and have small surface displacements ( radial surface displacements are likely on the order centimeters ) .",
    "recently , gaulme et al .  ( 2011 ) reported the detection of acoustic modes ( p - modes ) in the radial velocity data of jupiter , but the quality of the data was insufficient to provide new constraints on jupiter s interior model .",
    "saturn s ring system offers a unique opportunity to perform planetary seismology , because even mild gravitational perturbations associated with the planet s oscillation modes can generate density waves that propagate through the rings .",
    "marley & porco ( 1993 ) investigated this idea in detail , arguing that some of the unexplained wave features ( rosen et al .",
    "1991 ) in saturn s c and d - rings were produced at lindblad resonances with the gravitational perturbations associated with saturn s oscillation modes .",
    "however , the existing _ voyager _ data was insufficient to measure the properties of the waves , and so their seismic utility was limited .",
    "recently , hedman & nicholson ( 2013 ) ( hereafter hn13 ) used _ cassini _",
    "occultation data ( see colwell et al . 2009 ; baillie et al .  2011 ) to measure the radial location of lindblad resonance ( @xmath3 ) , azimuthal pattern number ( @xmath4 ) , and angular pattern frequency ( @xmath5 ) of several waves in saturn s c - ring .",
    "we retabulate the results of hn13 in table 1 .",
    "hn13 demonstrated that these waves can not be excited by resonances with any of saturn s ( known or unknown ) satellites , but are compatible with being excited by low degree prograde sectoral ( @xmath6 ) fundamental oscillation modes ( f - modes ) of saturn ( as predicted by marley 1991 and marley & porco 1993 ) . throughout this paper , we adopt the convention that perturbations have the form @xmath7 , with the inertial frame mode frequency @xmath8 .",
    "intriguingly , hn13 found what appeared to be a fine splitting \" in the mode frequencies : instead of one @xmath9 wave excited by saturn s @xmath10 , @xmath9 ( prograde ) f - mode , there are _ two _ discrete waves with a frequency difference of about @xmath11 ; instead of one @xmath12 wave excited by the @xmath13 , @xmath12 f - mode , there are _ three _ waves with a frequency difference of @xmath14 .",
    "no fine splitting was observed for the @xmath15 wave , and no waves with @xmath16 were observed .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the origin of these fine splittings is puzzling .",
    "saturn rotates rapidly ( with a spin period of @xmath17  hours ) , which splits the f - mode of a given degree @xmath18 into multiples with azimuthal order @xmath19 . for a given @xmath4 ,",
    "there are many f - modes that correspond to different degrees @xmath18 in the norotating configuration , but these modes differ in frequency by order unity ( for small @xmath18 ) , much larger than the observed splitting .",
    "rotation can also introduce other coriolis - force - supported modes ( inertial modes and rossby modes ) , but these modes all have frequencies ( in the rotating frame ) less than @xmath20 deg / day ( where @xmath21 is saturn s rotation rate ) , which are smaller than the f - mode frequencies .",
    "we discuss some other possible effects in section [ discconc ] .    in this paper ,",
    "we explore the properties of oscillation modes of giant planets that contain a solid core .",
    "we have two goals .",
    "( 1 ) previous calculations of the oscillation modes of giant planets have been restricted to pure fluid models , with or without a dense core ( e.g. , vorontsov & zharkov 1981 , vorontsov 1981 , marley 1991 , wu 2005 , le bihan & burrows 2012 ) . although the global oscillations of the solid earth are well studied ( dt98 ) and there have been some studies on the effects of elasticity of the solid cores / crusts in white dwarfs and neutron stars ( e.g. , hansen & van horn 1979 , mcdermott et al .",
    "1988 , montgomery & winget 1999 ) , to our knowledge , no previous works have investigated the elastic response of a solid core in giant planets .",
    "the elasticity of a solid core adds entire new classes of modes that have previously been ignored and can also modify the properties of fluid modes ( such as f - modes ) , which may have observable signatures .",
    "( 2 ) we examine the possibility of rotational mixing between elastic core modes and envelope f - modes . while the influences of rotation on the mode frequencies are well studied in stars ( unno et al .",
    "1989 ) and have been included in previous works on giant planetary oscillations ( e.g. , vorontsov 1981 ; marley 1991 ) , the possibility of rotation - induced mode mixing has not been investigated .",
    "we show that such mode mixing can in principle lead to the appearance of multiple oscillation modes having very similar frequencies and characteristics .",
    "nevertheless , as we show in this paper , significant fine tuning of the planetary model parameters is needed to produce the observed fine splitting of the waves in saturn s rings .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ planetarymodel ] ,",
    "we generate simple giant planet models that will serve as the basis of our oscillation mode calculations .",
    "section [ elastic ] describes the characteristics of oscillations in non - rotating planets , while section [ rotationcoup ] investigates mode mixing in rotating planets . in section [ gravpot ]",
    ", we calculate the effects of oscillation modes on saturn s rings , and we compare our results to the observations of hn13 . in section [ discconc ] , we summarize our results and discuss other effects ( such as differential rotation and magnetic fields ) that may modify the oscillation modes and influence mode mixing .",
    "since our goal is to understand the effect of core elasticity on the oscillations of giant planets and to explore the possibility of rotation - induced mode mixing , we will not use sophisticated giant planet models with `` realistic '' equation of state ( e.g. , guillot 2005 ) in this paper .",
    "instead , we will consider simple planet models composed of a one - component solid core surrounded by a neutrally stratified fluid envelope charaterized by a @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) polytropic equation of state .",
    "these models allow us to capture the basic properties of giant planets without getting bogged down in uncertain details ( e.g. , helium rain out , liquid - metallic hydrogen phase transitions , core size and composition , etc . ) .    to generate our planet models , we first construct a polytropic model of index @xmath22 ( so that the pressure is related to density as @xmath24 ) .",
    "we then add a solid core by choosing a core radius , @xmath25 , a dimensionless density enhancement @xmath26 , and constant shear modulus @xmath27 ( the shear modulus of the fluid envelope is zero ) .",
    "the density of material in the core is calculated by multiplying the density of material with @xmath28 in the original polytropic model by @xmath26 .",
    "we then normalize the density profile so that the total mass / radius equal the mass / radius of saturn . with this density profile ,",
    "we compute the gravitational acceleration via @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "we then assume the planet is neutrally stratified at all radii such that the brunt - vaisala frequency @xmath31 .",
    "the pressure @xmath32 is obtained by integrating the hydrostatic equilibrium equation @xmath33 , and the bulk modulus @xmath34 is given by [ k ] k = -g ( ) ^-1 .",
    "the bulk modulus is related to the pressure @xmath32 via @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .    for the purposes of calculating adiabatic acoustic - elastic pulsations in non - rotating spherically symmetric planets ,",
    "a planetary model is completely described by three quantities as a function of radius : the density @xmath37 , adiabatic bulk modulus @xmath34 , and the shear modulus @xmath27 ( see elastic oscillation equations in section [ elastic ] ) .",
    "thus , our models have four free parameters : the density profile index is the polytropic index ( as in @xmath38 ) of the planet without a core ; when a core is added , the pressure and density in the fluid envelope no longer satisfies the polytropic relation . ]",
    "@xmath39 , the radius of the solid core @xmath25 ( or more precisely , the ratio of @xmath25 to the planet radius @xmath40 ) , the core - envelope density jump @xmath26 , and the ( constant ) core shear modulus @xmath27 .",
    "these are ideally suited for understanding the basic characteristics of acoustic - elastic oscillations in giant planets .",
    "the @xmath22 polytropic density profile will generate realistic estimates of frequencies of p - modes propagating in the fluid envelope of the planet .",
    "the values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 affect the spectrum of modes propagating in the solid core , therefore , observations of these modes could provide strong constraints on core properties .     density , bulk modulus and gravity profiles in our model of saturn , with all quantities plotted in units with @xmath41 .",
    "this model has an envelope density profile of a polytrope of index @xmath22 , a core radius @xmath42 and a core density jump @xmath43 . ]",
    "figure [ satmodel ] displays the structure of our primary planet model examined in this paper .",
    "it was constructed using @xmath22 , @xmath44 , and @xmath43 .",
    "it has a core mass @xmath45 , central density @xmath46 , and central pressure @xmath47 pa . these values are consistent with the current observational constraints ( see guillot 2005 ) .",
    "as will be shown below , the value of the shear modulus in the solid core determines the characteristics of elastic oscillation modes within saturn .",
    "the core of saturn is likely composed of ices and rocks . assuming the core is at least partially solid , its shear modulus may be determined by the properties of high pressure ices ( of which water ice is the dominant component ) .",
    "unfortunately , the shear modulus of water ice is unknown at the pressures ( @xmath48pa @xmath49 bars ) and temperatures ( @xmath50k , guillot 2005 ) of saturn s core .",
    "asahara et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found @xmath51pa for water ice at room temperature and pressures of @xmath52 pa , well below the central pressure of saturn .",
    "the measurements of asahara et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show the shear modulus of ice increasing toward larger pressures , suggesting @xmath53pa in the core of saturn .",
    "however , the shear modulus of many materials is also dependent on temperature . in the solid core of the earth ,",
    "the shear modulus of iron near its melting point is smaller than the shear modulus of iron at lower temperatures and pressures ( laio et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "recent molecular dynamics simulations ( cavazzoni 1999 , french 2009 , militzer & wilson 2010 , militzer 2012 , hermann et al .",
    "2011 , wang et al . 2011 ) have predicted multiple new phases of ice at @xmath54pa . in particular , ice is likely in either a superionic or fluid phase at the core conditions of saturn ( french 2009 , wilson & militzer 2012 ) , depending on the core temperature . in the superionic phase ,",
    "the oxygen atoms form an ordered lattice , while the hydrogen atoms diffuse freely through the lattice .",
    "it is possible that the shear modulus of this superionic state is smaller than lower temperature phases of ice in which the oxygen - hydrogen bonds contribute to the strength of the lattice structure .    with such uncertainty in the shear modulus of material in a solid core of saturn , we take the shear modulus to be a free parameter . in this work , we consider shear moduli in the range @xmath55pa , or @xmath56 , which seems to be a reasonable range given the above considerations .",
    "for simplicity , we also assume the value of the shear modulus is constant throughout the core .",
    "the presence of a solid core affects planetary oscillations through the introduction of an elastic restoring force into the oscillation equations .",
    "the elastic force is characterized by the shear modulus @xmath27 , whereas compressibility is characterized by the bulk modulus @xmath34 . in a homogeneous elastic medium , there are two types of waves : ( 1 ) sound waves ( pressure waves or `` p - waves '' ) : these are longitudinal waves , with the displacement along the direction of wave vector @xmath57 , and the dispersion relation ^2=k+4/3k^2 ; ( 2 ) shear waves ( `` s - waves '' ) : these are transverse waves , with the displacement perpendicular to @xmath57 , and the dispersion relation ^2=k^2 .",
    "[ eq : disper ] the two polarizations of s - waves are designated sh ( `` shear horizontal '' ) and sv ( `` shear vertical '' ) in earth seismology . obviously , shear waves do not exist in fluid regions .    in our planet models with a solid core",
    ", p - modes can propagate throughout the planet , with different sound speeds in the core and in the liquid envelope .",
    "the introduction of elastic restoring forces allows for two new types of modes to propagate in the solid core : spheroidal shear modes and toroidal shear modes , for whom the elasticity is the dominant restoring force .",
    "the p - modes and spheroidal shear modes ( hereafter referred as `` s - modes '' ) are described by the displacement functions of the form ( * r * ) = u(r ) y_lm ( , ) * * + v(r ) ry_lm ( , ) . the toroidal shear modes ( hereafter refereed as `` t - modes '' ) are described by the toroidal displacement functions ( * r * ) = w(r ) .",
    "the t - modes exhibit no radial displacement , no gravitational perturbation , and are totally restricted to the solid regions of the planet . the s - modes , on the other hand , are slightly affected by the pressure perturbation , and can have a small , but finite gravitational perturbation .",
    "each mode oscillates at its eigenfrequency @xmath58 such that ( * r*,t ) = ( * r*)e^i t e^i ( m + t ) . with this convention ,",
    "prograde modes with positive frequency have @xmath59 , while retrograde modes with positive frequency have @xmath60 .",
    "introducing the elastic forces into the oscillation equations makes them considerably more complicated . in [ app1 ] , we list the full adiabatic acoustic - elastic oscillation equations ( see also dahlen & tromp 1998 , alterman et al .",
    "1959 , hansen & van horn 1979 , montgomery & winget 1999 ) and boundary conditions .",
    "the spheroidal oscillations are described by a system of six linear coupled ordinary differential equations , while the toroidal oscillations are decoupled from the spheroidal oscillation equations and are described by two linear coupled ordinary differential equations .",

    "the effect of a solid core on the properties of the f - mode and low order p - modes is miniscule .",
    "the main reason is that f - modes and low order p - modes have almost all of their inertia in the fluid envelope .",
    "consequently , the value of the shear modulus has essentially no impact on the f - mode frequency ( the the f - modes shown in figure [ fmodes ] differ by less than one part in @xmath86 in frequency ) , radial surface displacement , or potential perturbation .. ] nonetheless , the value of the shear modulus does affect the f - mode wave function in the core of the planet , as shown in figure [ fmodes ] .",

    "the f - mode may obtain a wave - like structure inside the core .",
    "finally , for fluid cores , the f - mode penetrates into the core , but with a small amplitude , due to the jump in density .    in the absence of rotation",
    ", the external gravitational perturbation will be produced almost exclusively by envelope f - modes and low order p - modes ( see figure [ satmodes ] ) . ) modes will produce significant external gravitational perturbations because the strength of the perturbation outside the planet falls off as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the distance from the center of the planet . ]",
    "the incompressive nature of low - order s - modes and t - modes creates zero ( for t - modes ) or very small density and gravity perturbations .",
    "furthermore , because s - modes and t - modes are largely confined to the core , they produce very small fluid displacements at the surface .",
    "thus , in the absence of rotation , s - modes and t - modes should be nearly impossible to detect .    because our planetary models are neutrally stratified , they do not support g - modes .",

    "thus far , we have considered the adiabatic acoustic - elastic oscillations of spherically symmetric , non - rotating planet models . however , the giant planets in our solar system spin rapidly , and the effects of rotation are quite important . for reference ,",

    "the only correction is from the coriolis force , which splits the @xmath104 degenerate eigenfrequencies ( corresponding to the @xmath104 values of @xmath4 for a given @xmath18 ) of the unperturbed planetary model .",
    "the second order rotational effects include the centrifugal force and the rotationally - induced planetary oblateness . in the absence of a solid core ,",
    "the envelope p - modes are well separated in frequency , and non - degenerate perturbation methods suffice when calculating the influence of rotation .",
    "however , in planetary models with a solid core , the addition of s - modes and t - modes may cause the spectrum of modes to become dense near the f - modes . in this case , the frequency spacing between modes may be smaller than the rotational corrections , and non - degenerate perturbation methods fail .",
    "rotation not only shifts the frequencies of oscillation modes , but can also induce strong mode mixing .",
    "spheroidal modes may acquire toroidal components , and vice versa .",
    "both s - modes and t - modes may mix strongly with the f - mode , and a more precise treatment of the rotational effect is necessary . in this paper , we consider only the first order rotational effect ( i.e. , the coriolis force ) , and assume uniform planetary rotation .    for two modes ( labeled @xmath61 and @xmath105 ) to be mixed by the coriolis force , the mixing matrix element ( see [ rotcoup ] ) [ eq : cdef ] c_ = i dv _ ^ * ( _  ) , where @xmath106 is the spin vector , must be nonzero .",
    "this leads to some basic selection rules .",
    "first , only modes with @xmath107 will mix .",
    "second , spheroidal modes only couple to other spheroidal modes with @xmath108 , and likewise for toroidal modes . finally , spheroidal and toroidal modes couple to one another only if @xmath109 .",

    "we do not consider rotational mixing with inertial or rossby modes ( if they exist in saturn s interior ) because these modes have a maximum frequency of @xmath111 in the rotating frame , and thus have smaller frequencies than any of saturn s f - modes .",

    "the pattern speed of the @xmath195 f - mode in the non - rotating models is consistently too large . adding the coriolis force lowers the pattern frequency of the modified f``-mode ( i.e. , the lowest frequency mode with a large value of @xmath140 ) , moving it closer to the observed pattern frequencies , although the predicted frequencies remain too high .",
    "adding second - order rotational effects is expected to lower the predicted frequencies further , making them more consistent with observations . obviously , with our simple planetary models , we should not expect exact agreement .",

    "we can use figures [ modesmu3]-[modesmu53 ] to understand the qualitative effects of rotationally - induced mode mixing . in the absence of rotation ,",
    "the spectrum of modes with significant gravitational perturbations is sparse , and is due almost entirely to f - modes and low - order p - modes .",

    "consequently , many modes that had miniscule potential perturbations in the non - rotating model ( and thus fall below the plotted range of figures [ modesmu3]-[modesmu53 ] ) obtain larger potential perturbations in the presence of rotation ( although typically still orders of magnitude smaller than the f - mode ) , causing the mode frequency spectrum for rotating models to appear much denser in figures [ modesmu3]-[modesmu53 ] .",
    "a mode nearly degenerate with the f - mode will obtain a potential perturbation @xmath198 , although in both modes are really hybrid f - modes . in this case , the two modes are split in frequency by @xmath199 .",
    "our results suggest that such exact degeneracies are rare in our planetary models , as described in section [ multimodemix ]",
    ". to achieve significant mixing , the frequency separation between a core mode and f - mode , @xmath200 , must be of order @xmath163 . however , in our models , the typical frequency separations @xmath201 between core modes are much larger than typical values of @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the chances of a near degeneracy between a core mode and f - mode are small .",
    "such degeneracies are possible ( see e.g. , the middle panel of figure [ modesmu3 ] ) , but usually require fine - tuning of model parameters ( such as the spin ) . since frequency splitting is observed by hn13 for both @xmath9 and @xmath12 modes , we conclude that it is unlikely to be produced solely by coriolis coupling between core modes and f - modes .",
    "finally , we examine the influence of the value of the shear modulus in the core .",
    "if saturn s solid core has a shear modulus @xmath202 ( figure [ modesmu53 ] ) , then the core shear modes have frequencies that are typically larger than the f - mode . also , the core mode spectrum is sparse , making it very unlikely for core modes to mix strongly with the f - mode .",
    "therefore , if @xmath203 , the observed waves in saturn s rings can not be generated by the addition of elastic core oscillation modes for reasonable saturnian models . on the other hand , if the shear modulus is @xmath204 ( figure [ modesmu3 ] ) , there may exist many oscillation modes with frequencies in the vicinity of the f - mode , allowing for the possibility of strong mode mixing .",
    "however , a smaller shear modulus also decreases the coupling coefficients , requiring a higher degree of degeneracy ( smaller @xmath200 ) for efficient mode mixing to occur .",
    "we have examined the influence of a solid core on the oscillation mode spectrum of giant planets . in our planetary models ,",
    "the rigidity of the core has a rather small effect on the frequencies of f - modes or low order p - modes , even for the largest core size ( @xmath42 ) and the range of shear modulus @xmath27 considered in this paper : the mode frequencies change change by less than @xmath205 percent .",
    "however , the addition of a solid core adds two new branches of oscillation modes : the spheroidal and toroidal core modes , whose restoring force is the elastic shear force of the solid material . the frequency spectrum of these modes is dependent primarily on the core radius @xmath25 and shear modulus @xmath27 , with larger and less rigid ( small @xmath27 ) cores supporting dense spectra of low frequency shear modes . in the absence of rotation ,",
    "these modes are almost completely confined to the core , and they produce negligible displacements or gravitational perturbations at the surface of the planet .    we have also examined the influence of the coriolis force on the mode frequencies and eigenfunctions .",
    "in addition to changing the mode frequencies , the coriolis force also induces mixing between oscillation modes of equal azimuthal number @xmath4 .",
    "spheroidal modes of angular degree @xmath18 mix with one another , as do toroidal modes .",
    "furthermore , spheroidal modes of angular degree @xmath18 mix with toroidal modes of angular degree @xmath85 , allowing for chains of mode mixing extending to arbitrary values of @xmath18 .",
    "mode mixing is strongest when the rotationally modified frequencies of two modes are nearly degenerate with one another . if the value of the core shear modulus @xmath27 is small ( @xmath206 ) but finite , the spectrum of core oscillation modes is dense near the f - mode",

    "these strongly mixed modes would manifest themselves as hybrid f \"- modes , with nearly equal frequencies and similar mode eigenfunctions .",
    "one of the objectives of this investigation is to compare our planetary oscillation calculations with the results of hn13 , who have measured the pattern numbers and frequencies of waves in saturn s c ring that appear to be excited by saturn s oscillation modes .",
    "as speculated by hn13 and originally proposed by marley & porco ( 1993 ) , we find that the pattern frequencies and azimuthal numbers associated with individual waves in saturn s rings are consistent with being excited by saturn s prograde sectoral ( @xmath195 ) f - modes .",
    "it is possible that with more realistic planetary models and including higher order spin affects , the measured frequencies of these modes can be used to constrain saturn s interior structure .",
    "hn13 s observations of multiple wave trains , finely spaced in frequency but with identical @xmath4 ,",
    "seem to indicate the existence of multiple oscillation modes with frequencies near the frequencies of saturn s f - modes .",
    "we have shown that the rotation - induced mixing between shear modes in saturn s core and f - modes in saturn s fluid envelope can in principle lead to such finely spaced frequency splitting .",
    "our theory has a number of notable features when comparing with the observations :    \\(i ) our theory explains why the waves observed by hn13 all lie close to the predicted locations of resonances with saturn s f - modes .",
    "we have shown that only core modes very near in frequency to the f - mode will mix appreciably with it .",
    "therefore , only these modes will obtain large enough gravitational potential perturbations to produce observable disturbances in saturn s rings .",
    "\\(ii ) our theory can in principle account for the relative magnitude of the observed frequency splittings ( larger splitting for the @xmath207 modes , finer splittings for the @xmath181 modes , and no observable splitting for the @xmath208 mode ) .",
    "compared to higher degree modes , the @xmath10 , @xmath207 f - mode penetrates deeper into the planet .",
    "it has more inertia in the core , and thus mixes more strongly with core modes , as evidenced by its larger rotational coupling coefficients @xmath163 with core modes .",
    "therefore we should expect that modes that mix strongly with the @xmath10 f - mode to have larger frequency separations from it than the modes that mix with the @xmath13 , @xmath181 f - mode or the @xmath74 , @xmath208 f - mode .",
    "\\(iii ) hn13",
    "s observations show that the finely spaced waves in saturn s ring have different optical depth variations . in our theory",
    ", modes nearly degenerate with the f - mode may obtain potential perturbations comparable to ( but less than ) that of the unperturbed f - mode , with the precise values determined by the rotational coupling coefficient and degree of frequency detuning .    despite these positive features",
    ", our theory of rotation - induced mode mixing suffers a serious fine - tuning problem when explaining the hn13 observations .",
    "our calculations indicate that f - modes mix with core shear modes efficiently only when their frequency differences are very small .",
    "such small frequency detunings are unlikely to occur unless the planetary model ( including the rotation rate ) is fine - tuned to produce a core mode nearly degenerate with the f - mode .",
    "even with a finely tuned model , it is difficult to simultaneously achieve the observed @xmath207 and @xmath181 frequency splittings .",
    "another concern is that a very small value of the shear modulus of the solid core ( @xmath209 ) is required for our mechanism ( in order to produce a dense spectrum of core modes near the f - mode frequency ) . in comparison ,",
    "the shear modulus of earth s core is @xmath210 .",
    "( laio et al . 2000 ) , and the pressure in saturn s core is of order @xmath211 .",
    "although such a small value of the shear modulus may seem unlikely , it may be produced by the high pressure superionic phase of ice ( see references in section [ shearmod ] ) likely to exist in saturn s core .",

    "the fractional correction , @xmath223 is less than @xmath224 even for an extremely strong ( @xmath225  kg ) internal field .",
    "this effect may be neglected .",
    "\\(iv ) in this paper we have focused on f - mode mixing with shear modes in the core .",
    "but there may be other types of modes that can participate in the mixing .",
    "we have noted before ( section 1 ) that inertial modes or rossby modes can not directly mix with the f - mode because of their frequency mismatch .",
    "but they may be involved in secondary mixing in a multiple - mode mixing system ( see section [ multimodemix ] ) . also , in the presence of stratification of heavy elements ( see leconte & chabrier 2012 ) , the fluid envelope may support gravity modes .",
    "these new modes can increase the `` phase space '' of mixing with f - modes , allowing them to be observed indirectly .",
    "overall , it remains unclear at present whether the finely spaced density waves observed in saturn s c - ring can be naturally produced by the simultaneous presence of finely split oscillation modes inside saturn . in this regard",

    "we use the observed values of @xmath364 and @xmath368 from hn13 , and we assume the wave is generated by an unmixed @xmath13 , @xmath12 f - mode with @xmath369 , determined from our mode calculations .",
    "this procedure typically results in a dimensionless amplitude @xmath370 .",
    "we then assume energy equipartition amongst the oscillation modes , such that the amplitudes of modes in our model are determined by @xmath371 .",
    "the optical depth variation is then calculated according to equation ( [ taupert ] ) , and is evaluated at @xmath367 ."

    "<S> recent observations have revealed evidence for the global acoustic oscillations of jupiter and saturn . </S>",
    "<S> such oscillations can potentially provide a new window into the interior structure of giant planets . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these observations , we study the non - radial oscillation modes of giant planets containing a solid core . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations include the elastic response of the core and consider a wide range of possible values of the core shear modulus . while the elasticity of the core only slightly changes the frequencies of acoustic modes ( including the f - modes ) , which reside mostly in the fluid envelope , it adds two new classes of shear modes that are largely confined to the core . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the effects of the coriolis force on the planetary oscillation modes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to changing the mode frequencies , the coriolis force can cause the shear modes to mix with the f - modes . </S>",
    "<S> such mixing occurs when the frequencies of the shear mode and the f - mode are close to each other , and results in `` mixed modes '' that have similarly large surface displacements and gravitational potential perturbations , but are slightly split in frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our results in light of the recent work by hedman & nicholson ( 2013 ) , which revealed the presence of density waves in saturn s c - ring that appear to be excited by the gravitational perturbations associated with the f - mode oscillations within saturn . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fine splitting in wave frequencies observed in the rings can in principle be explained by the rotation - induced mixing between core shear modes and f - modes , possibly indicating the presence of a solid core within saturn . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our current calculations , which assume rigid - body rotation and include only first - order rotational effects , significant fine - tuning in the planetary model parameters is needed in order to achieve these mode mixings and to explain the observed fine frequency splitting . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss other effects that may modify the f - modes and facilitate mode mixing .    </S>",
