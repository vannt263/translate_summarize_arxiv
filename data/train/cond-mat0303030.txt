    "any system which has a finite size @xmath4 in at least one space dimension we will call a finite - size system or a system with restricted geometry . in",
    "such systems singularities in the thermodynamic functions at the critical point may occur only in the thermodynamic ( bulk ) limit , taken in at least @xmath5 dimensions ( @xmath5 is the lower critical dimension ) . mainly three specific geometries",
    "( with periodic boundary condition imposed along the finite dimensions ) are of particular interest : i ) the fully finite cube @xmath6 , ii ) the @xmath7-dimensional layer ( or film ) @xmath8 and iii ) the infinitely long cylinder @xmath9 .",
    "further in this review we will not discuss the latter two cases .",
    "so far , in the context of long - range ( lr ) interaction they are studied only in the spherical @xmath10 limit . for the corresponding results one may consult the review @xcite and the recent monograph @xcite .",
    "the geometry of real systems and monte carlo calculations usually correspond to the fully finite size case . during the last two decades",
    "the study of systems with restricted geometry has undergone an extensive development and gains still growing importance for the theory of critical phenomena @xcite . generally speaking the critical behavior depends essentially on geometry , boundary conditions , and on the universality class of the bulk system .",
    "it is well known that the universality class to which the critical behavior of a bulk system at a second order phase transition belongs depends upon the dimensionality of the space @xmath7 , the number of the components of the order parameter @xmath11 , the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( either in spin - space or in coordinate space ) and the interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "one of the most commonly studied interaction potentials , is the one corresponding to lr ferromagnetic interaction decaying algebraically with the spin separation @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 controls the range of the interaction .",
    "the investigation of such systems was initiated by joyce in his paper on the phase transition in the ferromagnetic spherical model@xcite .",
    "the interest in this type of interaction is tightly related to the exploration of the critical behavior of systems with restricted dimensionality in which no phase transition occurs otherwise ( see @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "the condition @xmath1 is needed to avoid an ill - defined thermodynamic limit . in the limit @xmath14",
    "the interaction ( after appropriate renormalization ) equals the equivalent - neighbors interaction @xcite .    the opposite case , corresponding to a lr interaction with @xmath15 , sometimes called also nonintegrable interaction , has been studied in connection with the so called `` non - extensive thermodynamics '' ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in spite of the recent growing interest ,",
    "the case of nonintegrable interaction is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "the lr interaction , @xmath13 , enters the expressions of the theory only through its fourier transform .",
    "the corresponding small @xmath16 expansion of the fourier transform has the general form @xmath17 with @xmath18 , for @xmath19 , i.e in the long - wavelength approximation .",
    "note that the case @xmath20 leads to logarithmic factors in ( [ 1 ] ) which are not allowed to enter the analysis below .",
    "however , further on we will formally relate @xmath20 , to the short - range ( sr ) interaction since then  ( [ 1 ] ) is the fourier transform of an interaction decaying exponentially with distance . depending on whether @xmath21 in  ( [ 1 ] )",
    "we will speak about _ leading _ or _ subleading _ lr term respectively . since the sr term @xmath22 in ( [ 1 ] ) always exists the problem in the momentum space must be considered with necessity as an interplay between sr and lr effects .",
    "this review is arranged as follows . in section [ bulk ]",
    "we summarize the results on the critical behavior of bulk systems with the lr interaction .",
    "some general remarks on the finite - size scaling ( fss ) for such systems are presented in section [ fss ] .",
    "we review some results on the finite - size critical behavior of systems with leading lr interaction in section [ llr ] and for the subleading one in section [ slr ] .",
    "section [ binder ] specially deals with binder s cumulant as an utilized tool to compare the theory to data from monte carlo simulations .",
    "some remarks on the cutoff effects are devised in section [ cutoff ] . in section",
    "[ unsolved ] we deliberately emphasize some unsolved issues . in [ app ] , we present some mathematical details in calculating lattice sums in the case of lr interaction .",
    "the results concerning the bulk critical behavior in the simplest case of the spherical limit was analyzed in details in @xcite ( for a recent review , see chapter 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "these results were generalized to the @xmath23 vector @xmath24 model by means of perturbation theory in combination with the renormalization group ( rg ) technique near the upper critical dimension @xcite @xmath25 , lower critical dimension @xcite @xmath26 , and the @xmath27-expansion @xcite .",
    "computer simulations also contributed to the exploration of the critical properties of such systems @xcite .    in the case of lr interaction , some rg predictions , e.g. using the @xmath28-expansion , can be verified in an ideal testing ground since the value of @xmath29 or @xmath30 would be small enough for integer values of the dimensionality . in this context",
    "the outcome of the computer simulations , obtained by means of the monte carlo method , concerned mainly ising systems @xmath31 with classical ( mean - field ) critical behavior @xcite , i.e. @xmath32 with @xmath33 , and nonclassical critical behavior @xcite , i.e. @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "some comparisons with rigorous results were obtained for low dimensional systems in @xcite and for @xmath7-dimensional systems in @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the critical behavior depends strongly upon the interaction parameter @xmath36 . when @xmath37 the expansion  ( [ 1 ] ) has been used for detailed investigations of the critical behavior of @xmath2 models including questions like the @xmath36 , @xmath7 and @xmath11 dependence of the critical exponents and critical amplitude ratios , as well as for determining the universal scaling functions . in this case , the lr term is _ leading _ and the critical exponents of the system are @xmath36 dependent . by increasing @xmath36 , a crossover from lr critical behavior to sr one takes place .",
    "this issue has been the matter of a long - standing debate in the literature . as a measure for the crossover",
    "one may consider the fisher exponent @xmath38 .",
    "first , it has been argued , that in the interval @xmath39 and above the critical temperature @xmath40 , the critical exponent @xmath38 is equal to @xmath41 with no corrections to order @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( at least ) , see@xcite , and to @xmath44 , see @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to believe that @xmath38 `` sticks '' to this value to all order in @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "so @xmath45 as a function of @xmath36 , is not continuous at the `` crossover point '' @xmath20 , since the sr exponent @xmath46 .",
    "later it was pointed out , in the cases of @xmath47 dimensions @xcite and in @xmath48 dimensions @xcite that the crossover from lr to sr critical behavior is shifted and occurs at a `` critical '' value of @xmath36 given by @xmath49 . as a result @xmath45 is a continuous function in @xmath36 at @xmath20 , since @xmath50 .",
    "further support for this assertion was obtained in the framework of different perturbation schemes in @xcite and @xcite . in terms of",
    "the rg language one can say that , by crossing the border point @xmath51 the corresponding lr and sr fixed points exchange stabilities and in a non vanishing range @xmath52 lr perturbations are irrelevant ( see also @xcite where the problem in the more general case of @xmath53 space was considered ) .",
    "this statement , which can be determined also from more general considerations ( see for example p.71 in @xcite ) seems to be accepted in the literature .",
    "however , some doubts arise since it conflicts with the opposite statement of  @xcite at least for the non ising case @xmath54 obtained on a most rigorous level .",
    "furthermore there is the criticism in @xcite against the use of @xmath55 as small perturbation parameter .",
    "if one reconsiders the problem with @xmath56 as a small parameter in conjunction with the use of the perturbation scheme of @xcite , previous results that lr fixed point is stable up to @xmath20 , are restored .",
    "a recent attempt to reconsider this issue using monte carlo simulations @xcite shows unambiguously , a crossover at @xmath57 , in agreement with @xcite , but there only the ising case ( @xmath58 ) is considered .",
    "consequently , the situation seems to be settled only for the case @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath59 one usually considers the model as equivalent to a model with sr interaction , since it is widely accepted @xcite that , the lr terms ( i.e. the third and etc . in eq.([1 ] ) ) , do not contribute to the critical behavior of the bulk system , consequently this term has been always omitted in the computational analysis .",
    "indeed , in this case , the critical exponents does not depend on the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "scaling is a central idea in critical phenomena near a continuous phase transition and in the field theory . in both cases",
    "the singular behavior emerges from the overwhelming large number of degrees of freedom , corresponding to the original cutoff scale , which need to be integrated out leaving behind long wavelength with smoothly varying momenta .",
    "this behavior is controlled by a dynamically generated length scale : the bulk correlation length @xmath60 .",
    "such a fundamental idea is difficult to test theoretically because it requires the study of a huge number of interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "experimentally , however , one hopes to be able to study _ scaling in finite systems _ near a second order phase transition .",
    "namely the system is confined to a finite geometry and the fss theory is expected to describe the behavior of the system near the bulk critical temperature ( for a review on the fss theory see @xcite ) . in a few words the _ standard _ fss is usually formulated in terms of _ only one _ reference length - the bulk correlation length @xmath60 . for a system with finite linear size @xmath4 ,",
    "the main statements of the theory are :    * i ) * the only relevant variable in terms of which the properties of the finite system depend in the neighborhood of the bulk critical temperature @xmath61 is @xmath62 .    *",
    "ii ) * the rounding of the the thermodynamic function exhibiting singularities at the bulk phase transition in a given finite system sets in when @xmath63 .",
    "the tacit assumption is that all other reference lengths are irrelevant and will lead _ only to corrections _ towards the above picture .",
    "moreover , the crucial point in the fss theory is that we always assume : the _ finite size _",
    "@xmath4 of systems under consideration and the correlation length @xmath60 are large in the microscopic scale .",
    "this means @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the _ scaling _ limit of a quantity is called its value when all corrections involving the ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68 are neglected .",
    "one postulates fss limit as : @xmath69    in the literature there exist two conceptually different approaches concerning the scaling regime .",
    "one inspired from the condensed matter theory uses lattice language and models , in which @xmath66 is fixed ( while @xmath4 and @xmath60 are large , going to @xmath70 ) .",
    "the other one is inspired from particle physics .",
    "it uses continuum field theory models , when @xmath4 and @xmath60 are fixed ( while @xmath66 is infinitely small , going to zero ) . for studying a dimensionless quantity when all the dependence on @xmath71 and @xmath60 is through the ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68 the two approaches",
    "seem to be equivalent",
    ".    we shall be interested in the case where only the bulk system displays a phase transition . in such system",
    "there is no fixed point for finite @xmath4 and so no crossover to any other fixed point as a function of @xmath62 can takes place .",
    "this means that an @xmath4-independent rg procedure can be used . in the case of lr interaction",
    "there are additional reasons ( related with possibilities of phase transitions in lowered dimensions ) to study the case where finite system as well the bulk displays a phase transition .",
    "however this more sophisticated case has been studied only in the sr case @xcite .",
    "so , we review the fss properties of fully finite systems in the framework of the continuous field theory .",
    "the effects of the cutoff @xmath72 related with @xmath66 fixed will be discussed in some details below .    in case of lr interaction",
    "there are two aspects of the theory which should be mentioned here .",
    "first , in addition to the sr term @xmath73 in the propagators of the feynman diagrams we have also the lr term @xmath74 .",
    "the last term causes peculiar mathematical problems @xcite concerning the evaluation of the lattice sums over @xmath75 . among the various methods of accomplishing these summation some details of the method we prefer",
    "is presented in [ app ] , where its advantages are also discussed .",
    "the second aspect arises specifically because the basic quantity of the theory @xmath60 is unambiguously defined for sr interactions . for the lr case it has to be defined in a more appropriate way @xcite .",
    "the standard definitions of the bulk correlation length are based on the asymptotic behavior of the pair correlation function at large distance .",
    "the two most commonly used definitions of the bulk correlation length are unambiguous in the case of exponential decay of the bulk pair correlation function @xmath76 with the distance @xmath77 .",
    "one defines @xmath78.\\ ] ] alternatively , one may consider the second moment of the bulk pair correlation function and define the effective correlation radius , @xmath79^{1/2}.\\ ] ] if the pair correlation function decays exponentially with distance , the two definitions are equivalent .",
    "a distinctive feature of the lr interaction is that the function @xmath76 decays as @xmath80 when @xmath81 , for @xmath82 ( see e.g.@xcite ) and both definitions yield @xmath83 .",
    "one can overcome this difficulty by following the approach proposed in @xcite ( see also p.138 of @xcite ) where instead of @xmath60 some bulk _ characteristic length _",
    "@xmath84 is used .",
    "this characteristic length determines the length - scale of variation of the correlation function and diverges at the critical point .    as in the bulk limit",
    "@xmath2 models are the most often used as laboratory tools on the basis of which one studies the scaling properties of finite - size systems .",
    "the exactly investigated cases are those corresponding to @xmath58 , i.e. for the ising model ( particular attention has been turned to the two dimensional case ) , and the limit @xmath10 , which includes the spherical model ( see e.g. chapter 5 in @xcite and p.141 in @xcite*)*. it is commonly assumed that the last one is the only model which combines exact solubility even in the presence of a magnetic field and direct relevance to the physical reality . for that reason it is especially suitable for testing the fss hypotheses . for @xmath85 there are no exact results and the commonly preferable analytical method for the derivation of the properties of the corresponding models ( like @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 , and heisenberg , i.e. @xmath88 ) is that of the rg theory .",
    "in addition an important amount of information for such systems is derived by numerical simulations , normally via monte carlo methods .",
    "a systematic and controlled field - theoretical approach to the quantitative computation of the thermodynamic moments was proposed in the middle of 80s@xcite for studying fss in the case of sr interaction .",
    "it is based on the idea of using a mode expansion , i.e. one treats the zero mode of the order parameter , which is equivalent to the magnetization , separately from the higher modes .",
    "the nonzero modes are traced over to yield an effective hamiltonian for the zero mode .",
    "this method is used in combination with the loop expansion in the framework of the minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "the method is quite general and was proven to apply to a large extent to the investigation of fss in systems with lr interaction and with finite number of components @xmath11 of the spin vector @xcite .",
    "however such systems have been the object of analytical investigations mainly recently @xcite .",
    "for example , it is possible to perform the quantitative computation of the thermodynamic moments , usually used in numerical analysis .",
    "these moments are related to the binder s cumulant @xmath89 and to various thermodynamic functions like the susceptibility .",
    "the present wisdom is that in the finite size case the results are quite different depending on whether the lr interaction is leading or subleading .",
    "so , below we will consider separately the cases of leading and subleading lr interaction .",
    "recall that the critical exponents depend upon the parameter @xmath37 controlling the interaction range . the fss properties ( under periodic boundary conditions ) in the spherical limit are well established .",
    "it has been found that the scaling properties of the system with sr interaction remains valid also in the case of lr interaction ( for a review see e.g chapters 4 and 5 in @xcite and references therein ) . for finite @xmath11",
    "a limited number of recent numerical results @xcite , as well as few analytical works @xcite became available .",
    "the nonlocal character of the lr interaction has been an obstacle in investigating the critical behavior by means of numerical methods . for that purpose",
    "different algorithms have been developed . using the ewald method to evaluate the energy of a given configuration ,",
    "the critical behavior of such systems for different values of @xmath7 , @xmath11 and @xmath36 has been investigated@xcite .",
    "another approach , analogous to fss , where the range of the interaction is cutoff at a certain value , whence the name `` finite - range scaling '' , is also used.@xcite this method has been tested essentially on the one dimensional ising model in the classical ( mean - field ) as well as in the nonclasical critical regimes .",
    "results of the aforementioned approaches have been judged comparable to the theoretical predictions .",
    "these treatments required special efforts that restrict the consideration to very small systems .",
    "recently , the problem was resolved by the use of cumulative probabilities within the wulff cluster algorithm @xcite .",
    "this method has been applied mainly to ising systems in the mean - field regime .",
    "the fss hypotheses have been tested in the nonclassical regime @xcite .",
    "the common conclusion of all these approaches is that in the case @xmath26 such systems exhibit a kosterlitz - thouless - like phase transition .",
    "analytically the nonclassical case has been studied first for @xmath58 @xcite and for @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "it has been found that , as for the bulk systems , the critical behavior depends on the small parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the scaling properties of the finite system are not altered by the presence of the lr interaction and can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the critical exponent of the observable @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "some thermodynamic quantities , like for instance , the shift of the critical temperature due to the finite size effects , the susceptibility and the binder s cumulant at the bulk critical temperature @xmath61 @xcite and above it , @xcite as a function of @xmath95 have been obtained .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of the finite size properties has been considered in details in reference @xcite by means of a method , which consists of the use of the minimal subtraction scheme applied to a fixed space dimensionality @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the critical behavior of the system is dominated by its bulk critical behavior away from the critical domain and that the fss is relevant in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "a distinctive feature of the lr case is that for @xmath96 the finite - size corrections are not exponentially small as in the sr case ; they vary instead as power - in - l law , in both the spherical @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath97 cases @xcite .    in @xcite the behavior of the coupling constants during the crossover from lr to sr interactions i.e.",
    "the limit @xmath98 , was considered . to one - loop order",
    "it has been concluded that the renormalized values of the temperature and the coupling constant are continuous functions of @xmath36 .",
    "as it was mentioned above a quantity of central interest in the study of the critical behavior of finite size systems is the binder s cumulant ratio @xmath89 . here",
    "we present the analytical result for @xmath89 ( @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the @xmath11-th moment ; for some details , see@xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "close to the critical point we have @xmath101\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+z^2\\left[\\frac{\\gamma\\left(\\frac14(n+6)\\right ) \\gamma\\left(\\frac14(n+2)\\right ) } { \\gamma\\left(\\frac14(n+4)\\right)\\gamma\\left(\\frac14n\\right ) } + 3\\frac{\\gamma^2\\left(\\frac14(n+4)\\right ) } { \\gamma^2\\left(\\frac14(n+2)\\right)}-n-1\\right ] + o\\left(z^3\\right)\\right\\}'.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the fixed point @xmath102 is given by @xcite ( @xmath29 ) @xmath103.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have introduced the scaling variable @xmath104 and the function @xmath105.\\ ] ] in eq.([b2 ] ) @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the generalized mittag - leffler and the reduced jacobi @xmath108 functions , respectively ( see also [ app ] for details ) .",
    "the function @xmath109 is well known @xcite in the theory of fss .",
    "finally , let us notice that one can easily see that the expression ( [ zfixed ] ) for @xmath102 as a function of @xmath110 verifies the fss hypotheses and , consequently , all the thermodynamic functions , which indeed are @xmath102 dependent , do @xcite . at the critical temperature @xmath61 ( i.e. @xmath111 , and so @xmath112 )",

    "note that the function @xmath114 increases as the parameter @xmath36 vanishes .",
    "numerical values for the binder s cumulant ratio ( [ amplitude ] ) can be obtained by replacing the value of @xmath121 form ( [ z0 ] ) and taking some specific values of the small parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the behavior of the universal constant @xmath89 for the cases @xmath35 is presented in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , respectively .",
    "note that the scaling variable @xmath102 is proportional to @xmath122 as it was found previously ( see @xcite for example ) in the case of sr forces .",
    "furthermore for @xmath58 it is in full agrement with the result obtained in reference @xcite devoted to the exploration of fss in @xmath2 systems with lr interaction .",
    "notice that in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the mathematically ensuing pertinent integrals have to be evaluated only numerically , due to the choice of a parametrization , e.g. ( [ scr ] ) , that does not reduce the @xmath7-dimensional problem to the effective one - dimensional one .",
    "the approach proposed in @xcite based on the parametrization ( [ btr ] ) is more efficient in the sense that the corresponding final expressions can be handled by analytical means @xcite .",
    "it has been found @xcite , using the monte carlo method , that the amplitude ratio @xmath123 ( which is related to @xmath89 ) is a linear function of @xmath28 ( see also fig.1 and fig.2 ) , while the analytical result ( [ z0 ] ) shows an expansion in powers of @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "it is possible that higher orders in @xmath28 could improve the result .",
    "better agreement could also be obtained by using the method developed in @xcite .",
    "let us first note that the most prominent example for such kind of interaction in the case @xmath124 is the van der waals interaction @xmath125 for which we have @xmath126 .",
    "one can easily see that in this case the fourier transform is indeed of the type ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the fact that the critical behavior is not affected by the lr interaction if @xmath59 is well established in the bulk case . analytically , in the framework of @xmath10 model it has been shown @xcite that such a statement is incorrect for finite - size systems because of finite - size contributions due to the _ subleading _ , @xmath59 , term in the interaction .",
    "it has been shown also that the same remains true for a finite number of component by means of the rg techniques @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite have investigated the fss behavior of a fully finite @xmath2 system with periodic boundary conditions and in the presence of a lr interaction that _ does not alter the sr exponents _ of its critical behavior .",
    "the small @xmath127 expansion of the fourier transform of the interaction @xmath128 is supposed to be of the form  ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath129 .",
    "for such a system , it has been demonstrated that all the thermodynamic functions can be expressed in a scaling form as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a model ( nonuniversal ) constant .",
    "note that one needs two scaling variables in order to describe in a proper way the finite size behavior of these quantities .    at the critical point",
    "the binder s cumulant is given @xcite by ( [ amplitude ] ) with @xmath132,\\ ] ] where @xmath133 .",
    "so , in this case @xmath89 is not an universal constant . the behavior of @xmath89 as a function of system size @xmath4 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . equation ( [ fpsl ] ) is a generalization for the case under consideration of the result obtained in @xcite for sr interaction .",
    "when @xmath96 , it was found that the susceptibility approaches its bulk value not in an exponential - in-@xmath4 , as it was commonly believed to be the case for systems with short - range critical exponents , but in a power - in-@xmath4 way of the order of @xmath134 .",
    "the last goes beyond the standard formulation of the finite - size scaling , but is completely consistent with the intrinsic large - distance power - law behavior of the correlations in systems with subleading lr interactions . in the spherical limit such large - distance power - law behavior",
    "is shown exactly in @xcite .",
    "for an _ arbitrary _ value of @xmath36 , away from the critical point , i.e. in the region @xmath96 , the binder s cumulant ratio is given by @xmath135 , with finite size correction falling off in a power law .",
    "this result corresponds to a @xmath11-dimensional gaussian distribution for @xmath11 independent components of the vector variable .",
    "obviously , all the values lie in the interval from @xmath136 ( ising model , @xmath58 ) to @xmath137 ( spherical model , @xmath10 ) .",
    "in the above , we have concentrated our attention on how to separate the size dependence in the continuum ( scaling ) limit , where the linear size as well as the correlation length tend to infinity , but keeping their ratio a finite quantity . in this theory",
    "the cutoff is sent to infinity and the lattice spacing completely disappears .",
    "this is precisely the regime in which one expects fss to hold @xcite and this statement , as it was pointed out , does not depend on the range of the interaction .    in order to clarify the effect of a ( sharp ) cutoff",
    "it is sufficient to consider the pure sr case .",
    "the finite cutoff effects violate the fss , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the result is a system with finite - size behavior with leading nonscaling term going as an inverse power law in @xmath4 that depends also on @xmath138 . in @xcite",
    "this is shown to be tightly related to lattice effects in the system in _ conjunction _ with the long wavelength approximation .",
    "indeed this is not in conflict with the arguments proposed in @xcite where the limit of infinite cutoff is considered .",
    "later , in @xcite one argues : i ) the violation of scaling is related with the second term in ( [ ae1 ] ) which in the case @xmath139 can not be omitted in the region @xmath140 , ii ) the effect of the sharp cutoff is similar to that found if one considers the effect of subleading lr interaction .",
    "obviously , this effective lr nature of the finite - size behavior should generate difficulties in the analysis of the monte carlo data from simulations not only for sr , but for lr systems as well .",
    "the last follows directly from ( [ int1 ] ) .",
    "recently , the reconsideration of the problem in @xcite has shown that the source of these obstacles is the artificial cusp - like singularity @xmath141 at the border of the brillouin zone ( @xmath142 ) . as a result ,",
    "if one treats properly the effects generated by the momentum cutoff in the fourier transform of the interaction potential both , the lattice and continuum models may produce results in mutual agreement independent of the cutoff scheme @xcite .",
    "first , an area where the bulk rg predictions @xcite must be tested by means of numerical methods is the case of @xmath143 .",
    "the strong indication @xcite that exactly here some problems exist , remains still valid .",
    "the numerical results of @xcite shed some light on the ising case @xmath58 but do not solve the longstanding controversy about the boundary between lr and sr critical behaviors as a function of @xmath36 .    in this review the fss properties of systems with no crossover from the bulk fixed point to any other as a function of @xmath62",
    "are considered .",
    "let us note that within the sr models this issue is studied in @xcite .",
    "the consideration of this crossover in the lr is missing . on the other hand ,",
    "e.g. systems with slab and cylinder geometries and @xmath144 have been studied only in the sr case .",
    "the first one is related to the statistical - mechanical casimir effect in fluctuating systems @xcite and recently there has been an upsurge in theoretical investigations@xcite . the second one deals with the so called transfer matrix ( or hamiltonian ) formulation of the problem @xcite ( see also chapter 36.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "a study of both cases in the context of the lr interactions is a provocation for the theory and is of undoubted experimental interest .",
    "some problems exist with the comparison of the analytical results and the numerical data .",
    "it has been shown@xcite ( see also @xcite ) using monte carlo simulation ( for @xmath58 ) , that the binder s cumulant ratio is linear in @xmath28 . the analytical evaluation ( [ amplitude ] ) for the @xmath2 symmetric @xmath24 model",
    ", however , showed that it is linear in @xmath122 . a possible way to resolve this controversy between the monte carlo method and the analytical results",
    "is to carry on finite - size calculations to higher loop order@xcite .",
    "this could ameliorate the analytical results , which would be comparable to those obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "however we would like to mention that higher loop corrections that are dealt with through the minimal subtraction scheme and the @xmath28-expansion are not done , even for the more simple case of sr interaction .",
    "we have witnessed that two - loop calculations can be applied in many other investigations like the problems taking into account disorder effects in finite size systems @xcite . here",
    ", if @xmath58 , the one - loop fixed point is degenerate and the first interesting results can be obtained only if one considers two loops .    as it is discussed in the previous section in the long wavelength approximation ( [ 1 ] ) , if one goes beyond the continuum field theory , the lattice effects in conjunction with the sharp cutoff generate nonuniversal finite - size terms .",
    "the suggestion that such effects are artificial in the case of sr interaction @xcite seems to be true also in the lr case .",
    "how to avoid the problem in the framework of a concrete cutoff scheme in the case of lr interaction is still an open problem .    in recent years",
    "considerable attention has been paid to the critical dynamics of systems with lr interaction @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the corresponding results to the finite - size case .",
    "let us note that for the case of the sr interaction the theory of finite size effects in critical dynamics was developed in @xcite(see also chapter 36.6 of @xcite ) .",
    "the present review is devoted to the classical critical phenomena . however , another interesting field is closely related to the extensively investigated field of quantum critical points , i.e. phase transitions occurring at zero - temperature @xcite .",
    "let us just recall that in systems showing quantum critical behavior the temperature plays two different roles . for temperatures",
    "low enough , quantum effects are essential . in this case",
    "the temperature affects the geometry to which the system is confined adding a `` new '' size to the eucludean space - time coordinate system . by raising the temperature ,",
    "the system is driven away from the quantum criticality . at high temperatures , however , the size in the `` imaginary - time '' direction becomes irrelevant in comparison with all length scales in the system . in this case we have a classical system in @xmath7 dimensions and the temperature is just a coupling constant in the classical critical behavior . in this context we find it useful to investigate the quantum models , with lr interaction , e.g. considered in @xcite in the large @xmath11 limit or in @xcite in the mean field and one - loop rg theory .",
    "in order to introduce the reader to the problems let us first consider in some details the sr case on a @xmath7-dimensional hypercubic lattice @xmath145 with @xmath146 sites and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the sites are given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 ranges over all distinct integer values @xmath149 , for @xmath150 .",
    "let us consider the dimensionless expression , entering most of the mathematical analysis of the scaling properties of finite systems @xmath151\\right\\}^{d}dt,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath152 and @xmath153 is even .",
    "for the sum @xmath154,\\ ] ] using the result of @xcite , we have @xmath155 -\\frac{2\\pi^{2}t}{3}\\frac{1}{am}\\exp\\left[-\\pi^{2}t\\left(\\frac{1}{am } \\right)^{2}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi t } } \\left\\ { \\sum_{l=1}^{\\infty } \\exp[-l^{2}(amn_{0})^{2}/4t]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] valid in the large @xmath153 asymptotic regime .",
    "the first and the second terms in the above equation are size independent and are precisely the infinite volume limit of @xmath156 .",
    "the ultraviolet divergences which may appear in the theory when the lattice spacing vanishes are related with the first term , for which one must perform the required subtractions ( see , e.g. p. 177 of @xcite ) .",
    "the second term depends on the ratio @xmath157 and so if @xmath158 or @xmath159 it is of order @xmath160 in the continuum limit such terms are exponentially small and must be omitted .",
    "the different finite - size regimes are governed by the ratio @xmath161 in the third term .",
    "they are independent of the microscopic details , e.g. lattice spacing @xmath66 . when @xmath65 , the _ universal properties _ can be described by a continuous field theory .",
    "let us recall that the finite linear dimension @xmath162 , in the case of continuous finite volume means that @xmath163 and simultaneously @xmath164 .    in the continuum limit , since @xmath165",
    ", we end up with the result @xmath166 where the size dependence is contained in the function @xmath167^{d } -1 \\right\\}dt,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath168 the bulk part @xmath169 contains poles at @xmath170 .",
    "the finite size correction @xmath171 combined with the corresponding contribution from the counterterm yields @xcite ( to one - loop order ) a finite - size shift of the `` mass term '' @xmath172 .    in order to investigate the fss properties of systems with lr interaction",
    ", one can use a suitable mathematical method allowing to simplify the analytical calculations . in the above case of sr interaction it has been possible to replace the summand in eq .",
    "( [ ole ] ) by its laplace transform @xmath173^{d},\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath174 are d - dimensional and one - dimensional discrete vectors , respectively .",
    "this is the so called schwinger parametric representation .",
    "the aim of this replacement is two fold : i ) to reduce the @xmath7-dimensional sum to the corresponding effective one - dimensional one , and ii ) to give to the dimensionality @xmath7 the status of a continuous variable . in the case with the @xmath36 term leading in ( [ 1",
    "] ) , one can not just use the schwinger representation in its familiar form .",
    "in@xcite the following generalization of ( [ scr ] ) has been suggested @xmath175^{d},\\ ] ] where the function @xmath176 for @xmath177 is given by @xmath178 and @xmath179 from ( [ btr ] ) and ( [ f ] ) for the summand in  ( [ btr ] ) one obtains @xmath180    the integral representation ( [ int1 ] ) illustrates the mathematical difficulty appearing in the lr case .",
    "it is shown that by an additional integration the problem can be effectively reduced to the sr case@xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath181 as a function of @xmath36 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) shows another aspect of the nonlocal character of the lr interaction @xmath0 .",
    "the function @xmath182 is related @xcite to the entire function of the mittag - leffler type defined by the power series @xmath183 for a more recent review on these functions see@xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that @xmath184 and all the specific features of the finite size properties of systems with lr interaction are a result of the analytical properties of the mittag - leffler type functions ( for some examples , see e.g. chapters 5 and 6 of @xcite ) .    in the case with both sr and lr terms the corresponding expressions are significantly more complicated .",
    "when the lr term is of the peculiar type @xmath185 ( and the parameter @xmath186 ) considered in the context of the bulk crossover the following replacement of the sr propagator takes place @xcite @xmath187 to the corresponding one - dimensional sum in the right hand side of ( [ lrt ] ) , the following identity has been used@xcite @xmath188 here , @xmath189 is the degenerate hypergeometric function ( kumer s function ) .",
    "the same identity  ( [ kti ] ) has been used in @xcite to analyze the finite - size behavior of a propagator with sr and subleading , i.e. @xmath59 , lr interaction ( treated as a perturbation ) where terms similar to the r.h.s . of  ( [ lrt ] ) also appear . in the last case",
    "an expression for the entire propagator ( i.e. sr and lr interactions treated on equal ground ) can be obtained via contour integration on the complex plane@xcite .    the identities ( [ btr ] ) and ( [ kti ] ) demonstrate that lr case can be effectively reduced to the sr case with an integration over an additional parameter .",
    "so , all the mathematical machinery developed for the sr case may be used without further complications .",
    "the authors thank j.g.brankov for reading the manuscript and for his important comments .",
    "is also indebted to d.m.danchev for acquainting with the article @xcite prior to publication and for illuminating discussion on the cutoff effects .",
