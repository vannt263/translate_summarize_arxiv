    "the interaction between physics and mathematics can go in both ways .",
    "for example , maxwell s theory , introduced to describe electromagnetism , has later been applied also to mathematics , namely to potential theory .",
    "this happened again when maxwell s electromagnetism was generalized to describe non - abelian interactions  and yang - mills theory became , later , an essential tool in differential geometry for studying the characteristic ( pontryagin ) classes over even - dimensional manifolds .    with chern - simons theory history went the opposite way  : in the early 1970 , s. s. chern and simons @xcite introduced their secondary characteristic classes to study bundles over odd - dimensional manifolds ; this geometrical tool found subsequent application in low - dimensional physics . in @xmath0 space - time dimensions ( the only case we study in this review ) , the ( abelian )",
    "chern - simons three - form is the non - abelian generalization ( not considered here ) of the chern - simons form is @xmath1 ] @xmath2 where @xmath3 is some vector potential .",
    "the first applications of the chern - simons form to physics came in the early 1980 , namely in _ topologically massive gauge theory _ @xcite .",
    "it has been realized that ( [ csform ] ) can indeed be added to the usual maxwell term in the electromagnetic action @xmath4    a novel feature is that while the 3-form ( [ csform ] ) is _ not _ invariant under a gauge transformation @xmath5 , @xmath6 the field equations associated with @xmath7 , @xmath8 _ are _ gauge invariant .",
    "this is understood by noting that , using the sourceless maxwell equation @xmath9 , the lagrangian action ( [ csemaction ] ) is seen to change by a mere surface term , @xmath10 and defines , therefore , a fully satisfactory gauge theory in 3 dimensions .",
    "moreover , it can be inferred from ( [ csfe ] ) that the chern - simons dynamics endows the gauge field @xmath11 with a `` topological mass . ''",
    "the chern - simons term can be used , hence , to supplement the usual maxwellian dynamics ; it can even replace it altogether .",
    "the resulting dynamics is `` poorer '' , since it allows no propagating modes .",
    "it has , in turn , larger symmetries  : while the maxwell term @xmath12 requires giving a metric @xmath13 , the chern - simons term is _ topological _  : the integral @xmath14 is independent of the coordinates we choose .",
    "thus , while the maxwell theory has historically been at the very origin of ( special ) relativity , the chern - simons term can allow both relativistic and non - relativistic ( or even mixed ) theories .",
    "the large invariance of the chern - simons term lead , in the mid - eighties , to consider a galilean field theory @xcite .",
    "the main physical application of chern - simons gauge theory is , however , in condensed matter physics , namely to the _ quantum hall effect _ @xcite .",
    "the latter , discovered in the early eighties @xcite , says that in a thin semiconductor in a perpendicular magnetic field the longitudinal resistance drops to zero if the magnetic field takes some specific values , called `` plateaus '' .",
    "the current , @xmath15 and the electric field , @xmath16 , should satisfy in turn an `` off - diagonal '' relation of the form @xmath17 where the real coefficient @xmath18 , identified as the _ hall conductivity _ , is , furthermore , _",
    "quantized_. in the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xmath18 is an integer multiple of some basic unit , while in the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , it is a rational multiple .",
    "the explanation of this surprising and unexpected quantization , provided by laughlin s `` microscopic '' theory , involves quasiparticles and quasiholes .",
    "( for details the reader is referred to the literature @xcite ) . these are composite objects that carry both ( fractional ) electric charge and a magnetic flux  : they are _ charged vortices_.    the similarities of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) with superfluidity lead condensed matter physicsist , however , to ask for a phenomenological effective theory of the fqhe @xcite .",
    "remember that the phenomenological description of ` ordinary ' superconductivity and superfluidity is provided by landau - ginzburg theory @xcite  : the cooper pairs formed by the electrons are represented by a scalar field , whose charge is twice that of the electron .",
    "the scalar fields interact through their electromagnetic fields , governed by the maxwell equations .",
    "the theory admits static , finite - energy , vortex - like solutions @xcite .",
    "landau - ginzburg theory does not involve the time as it `` lives '' in space alone .",
    "its relativistic extension , called the abelian higgs model @xcite , admits again static and purely magnetic vortex - type solutions @xcite .",
    "note that ordinary landau - ginzburg does not admit any interesting non - relativistic extension , owing to the intrinsically relativistic character of the maxwell dynamics .",
    "any `` landau - ginzburg '' theory of the fqhe must reproduce hall s law ( [ halllaw ] ) .",
    "now , as first pointed out in @xcite , adding the usual current term @xmath19 to the action and suppressing the conventional maxwell term , the spatial component of field equations become precisely _ hall law _ , ( [ halllaw ] ) .",
    "this observation does not seem to have influenced condensed matter physicsist , though , who went in their own way to arrive , independently , at similar conclusions .",
    "the evolution of chern - simons gauge theories has been parallel and ( almost ) unrelated in high - energy / mathematical physics and in condensed matter physics for at least a decade .",
    "it is interesting to compare the early progress in both fields  : similar ideas arose , independently and almost simultaneously , see table [ tableau ] .",
    "the main difference has been that while condensed matter physicist were more interested in the physical derivation and in its application to the hall effect , high - energy / mathematical physicists explored the existence and the construction of solutions .",
    ".the chern - simons form in field theory and in condensed matter physics . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first , static , ` landau - ginzburg ' theory for the qhe has been put forward by girvin @xcite on phenomenological grounds .",
    "an improved and extended to time - dependent theory was derived from laughlin s microscopic theory by zhang , hansson and kivelson @xcite , see section [ lgqhe ] .",
    "these theories involve , inevitably , the chern - simons form .",
    "in contrast to ordinary landau - ginzburg theory , they can accomodate relativistic as well as non - relativistic field theory is a strong argument in its favor  : while high - energy theories are typically relativistic , condensed matter physics is intrinsically non - relativistic .",
    "below , we review various aspects of chern - simons gauge theory .    in detail",
    ", we first recall the way that lead condensed matter physicists to chern - simons theory , remarkably similar to that advocated by feynman in his `` another point of view '' presented in his 1962 lectures on statistical mechanics @xcite .    interrupting the condensed - matter - physics approach , the field theoretical aspects start with section [ rvort ] , devoted to relativistic topological vortices .",
    "their non - relativistic limit is physically relevant , owing to the intrinsically non - relativistic character of condensed matter physics .",
    "it also provides an explicitly solvable model . for a particular choice of the potential and for a specific value of the coupling constant ,",
    "the second - order field equations can be solved by solving instead first order `` self - duality '' equations .",
    "the problem can in fact be reduced to solving the _ liouville equation_. not all solutions are physically admissible , though  : those which are correspond to _ rational functions_. this provides as with a _ quantization theorem of the magnetic charge _ , as well as with a _",
    "parameter counting_.    the symmetry problem enters the theory at ( at least ) two occasions .",
    "firstly , do the self - dual equations come from a bogomolny - type decomposition of the energy  ?",
    "this question becomes meaningful if a conserved energy - momentum tensor is constructed .",
    "such a proceedure is canonical in a relativistic field theory , but is rather subtle in the non - relativistic context .",
    "another important application is to the following .",
    "do we have other than non - self - dual solutions at the specific `` self - dual '' value of the coupling constant  ?",
    "the ( negative ) answer is obtained in a single line , if the conformal symmetry of the theory is exploited @xcite .",
