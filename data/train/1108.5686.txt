    "the discovery of planets around other stars has placed our solar system in context and stimulated speculation on the frequency of habitable planets and life in the universe .",
    "very cool dwarf stars ( with late k and early m spectral types ) are of special significance to such investigations because the two principle detection techniques , doppler radial velocity ( rv ) and transit photometry , are more sensitive to smaller planets around smaller stars .",
    "such stars are also much less luminous than solar - type stars , the circumstellar habitable zone is closer @xcite , and planets within the habitable zone are therefore more detectable @xcite . these stars test models of planet formation : for example , core - accretion models predict fewer gas giants and more `` failed '' cores @xcite , consistent with the lower frequency of giant planets and higher frequency of low - mass planets compared to g stars @xcite . finally , late k and early m dwarfs constitute three - quarters of all stars in the galaxy , and their contribution weighs heavily in any cosmic accounting of planets or life .",
    "most confirmed exoplanets have been found by the doppler technique , which can detect planets of a few earth masses on short - period orbits around bright late f- to early k - type stars @xcite .",
    "there are also doppler searches for planets around very cool dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the corot and _ kepler _ missions have successfully extended the search for small planets to space using the transit technique .",
    "the _ kepler _ spacecraft is monitoring @xmath8150,000 stars , including approximately 24,000 k - type stars and 3000 m - type stars @xcite , and has discovered hundreds of candidate planets with radii @xmath9 as small as @xmath80.8  r@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the distribution with @xmath9 peaks near 2r@xmath10  and at the completeness limit of _ kepler _ @xcite .    in principle , the mass @xmath11 of a transiting planet can be uniquely determined by doppler observations and mass and radii compared with theoretical relationships .",
    "the mean density of scores of giant planets and a handful of objects between the size of earth and neptune orbiting nearby stars have been determined in this manner @xcite .",
    "this technique has also successfully confirmed candidate planets around the brightest corot and _ kepler _ stars , including two with masses only a few times that of earth @xcite .",
    "comparison with a mass - radius relationship ( mrr ) can discriminate between denser planets composed of silicates and metal ( `` super - earths '' ) , and less dense planets with substantial envelopes of ices and hydrogen - helium gas ( `` ocean planets '' or `` mini - neptunes '' ) @xcite .",
    "however , the doppler signal expected from many _ kepler _",
    "candidate planets is comparable to total instrument noise and stellar `` jitter '' ( 2 - 3  m  s@xmath4 , figure [ fig.koi ] ) .",
    "rv measurements can be `` phased '' to the transit - determined orbit , achieving greater sensitivity .",
    "unfortunately , the great majority of cool _ kepler _ stars are too faint ( @xmath12 ) to achieve the required high snr even using 10-m telescopes .    instead , doppler observations of a sample of _ nearby _ , brighter stars can constrain the masses and mean densities of planets around corresponding _ kepler _ stars , assuming both samples host the same planet population .",
    "every planet will contribute to rv variance and the aggregate effect in excess of instrument errors and the noise from the stellar atmosphere ( `` jitter '' ) can be detected . given _",
    "kepler_-determined orbits and planet radii and a hypothetical mrr , the cumulative distribution of rv variation can be predicted and compared to that from the nearby population . for a given distribution of observed radii , denser",
    ", rocky planets will generate greater rv variation , while less dense , ice- or gas - rich planets will produce smaller variation .",
    "this approach exploits both the orbital information from _ kepler _ and the collective rv signal from the entire population . as with rv follow - up of individual transiting planets ,",
    "planets are first detected by transit ( _ kepler _ ) , then characterized by doppler observations .",
    "_ kepler _ observations would provide an exact description of a equivalent nearby population only in the limit of an infinite sample , and thus the finite size of the candidate planet sample introduces uncertainty .",
    "we show that this uncertainty is not debilitating .",
    "this method also rests on two assumptions : ( i ) the planet populations of the doppler and _ kepler _ samples are statistically the same , and ( ii ) the mrr of small planets can be described by simple empirical relations .",
    "we discuss the validity of both of these assumptions .",
    "we carry out such a combined transit - doppler analysis , predicting the statistical distribution of rv variation in the m2k survey of late k and early m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we use the _ kepler _ distribution of candidate planet radii , corrected for detection efficiency , and assume a single parametric mrr .",
    "we compare the predicted and observed distributions to constrain the mrr and hence the compositions of the small planets these stars host .",

    "giant interlopers are rare among the transiting planet - hosting _ kepler _ stars @xcite because the vast majority of planets are smaller than jupiter and not detectable around giant stars .",
    "additional incompleteness could come from higher stellar variability .",
    "our analysis appears robust to the precise choice of function for the distribution of jitter rms among stars , as long as the overall noise variance is conserved .",
    "it is also insensitive to the presence of correlated or `` red '' noise in the doppler rv data .",
    "although our results are not overly susceptible to random errors in estimated stellar radii , they do vary with uniform systematic errors in those values .",
    "if radii have been uniformly overestimated , as comparisons with stellar evolution models suggest , agreement between _ kepler _ and m2k statistics favors a slightly higher value of @xmath15 , reinforcing our conclusion that the small planets around these stars are primarily rocky .",
    "although the resulting offset of the locus with @xmath15 may seem small , one property of a power - law mrr is that a compensatory fractional change in index @xmath15 will equal the fractional magnitude of a systematic change in radius , modulo a logarithmic factor which is approximately unity .",
    "for example , if radii are 15% smaller then @xmath15 should be 4.6 instead of 4 .    systematic underestimation of stellar radii can be reconciled with the presence of interloping giant stars by accounting for strong selection effects among stars with transit - detected planets : just as transit surveys of a given set of stars are biased towards the largest planets @xcite , a given set of planets will be more readily detected by transit around the smallest stars in a sample ; stars with detected planets are thus not necessarily representative of the entire sample .",
    "reliable estimates of the radii of a presentative sample of late - type _ kepler _ target stars should be vigorously pursued .",
    "our analysis is predicated on statistically indistinguishable planet populations in our samples of stars from the _ kepler _ field and solar neighborhood .",
    "a plausible condition for this assumption is that the two samples have similar mass and metallicity distributions and be drawn from the same stellar population .",
    "the effective temperature distributions are similar , but not identical ( figure [ fig.teff ] ) and this may translate into differences in stellar mass . there is an excess of about 30 m2k stars ( @xmath820% of the sample ) around 4200  k and a deficit around 3850  k. according to a yale - yonsei 5  gyr solar - metallicity isochrone , this 350  k increase corresponds to changing the stellar mass from 0.57m@xmath26  to 0.65m@xmath26 . adopting the relation between stellar mass and giant planet frequency of @xcite at face value , these m2k stars would have a 14% higher incidence of giant planets , but the giant planet frequency in the overall sample would only be 3% higher . according to equation 9 in @xcite",
    "the frequency of _ all _ planets would decrease by 6% .",
    "m2k stars are all within 45  pc of the sun , and the median distance is 25  pc , placing them well within the galactic disk .",
    "these stars are drawn from a proper motion - selected catalog ( @xmath8240  mas  yr@xmath4 ) with a transverse velocity limit of 8.6  km  s@xmath4 at 45  pc @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion of stars in the solar neighborhood is anisotropic but a rough estimate of 80% completeness at 45 pc is obtained by assuming an isotropic distribution with a dispersion of 25  km  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the correlation between metallicity and velocity dispersion ( via age ) means that this sample will be biased against metal - rich stars , but this effect is very small : stars with [ fe / h]=-0.5 ( more metal - poor stars are very uncommon ) have a velocity dispersion @xmath85  km  s@xmath4 higher than their solar metallicity counterparts @xcite , and the corresponding completeness is @xmath884% at 45  pc .",
    "the bias against solar - metallicity stars in m2k is therefore @xmath965% .",
    "although we excluded the most active stars from the analysis and may have removed any very young stars , this should not affect the metallicity distribution because the metallicity - age relation is flat in this range @xcite .",
    "tidal decay of the orbits of low mass planets around small stars is expected to be extremely slow @xcite and would not appreciably evolve a planet population .",
    "the kinematics and metallicities of _ kepler _ field stars have yet to be established .",
    "the center of the _ kepler _ field ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) is nearly perpendicular to the direction to the galactic center , and approximately parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "we estimate photometric distances from _ kepler _ derived temperatures using the empirical relation for absolute magnitude @xmath127 . at the median estimated distance of the subsample",
    "( 256  pc ) , a star at the center of the _ kepler field _ has approximately the same galactocentric distance as the solar neighborhood and is only @xmath860  pc above the galactic plane ; most stars should belong to the thin disk and have near - solar metallicities .",
    "consistent with this , the trilegal stellar population model @xcite predicts that only 7% of stars in this range of effective temperature and magnitude belong to the thick disk or halo , and only 6% have [ fe / h ] @xmath128 .",
    "thus we conclude that the _ kepler _ and m2k samples are very similar in mass , metallicity , and age .",
    "@xcite estimated planet densities by comparing distributions of _ kepler _ radii with masses from a doppler survey of solar - type stars .",
    "they inferred a higher density for the smallest planets , consistent with our findings .",
    "@xcite , using a different set of doppler - detected planets , also concluded that the majority of small planets around solar - type stars are rocky .",
    "they also found that the proportion of low density , gas - rich planets increases with planet size , a feature essentially intrinsic to our analysis because of our choice of @xmath2 .",
    "theoretical models predict the formation of inner , rocky planets @xcite , and the stellar uv - driven escape of any primordial hydrogen atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the low density of the short - period super - earth gj  1214b can be explained by a substantial hydrogen envelope @xcite , but also by a thick h@xmath129o shell @xcite .",
    "its host is a cooler ( 3000  k ) , much less luminous mid - m star and this may permit retention of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "gas- and ice - rich planets resembling gj  1214b may be the exception rather than the rule around the coolest _ kepler _ target stars .",
    "refinement of doppler systematic errors and the properties of _ kepler _ target stars , specifically the radii of k and m dwarfs and the fraction of interloping giants , will permit more robust constraints .",
