    "the color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) in galaxies in the cores of galaxy clusters is a fossil record of the integrated star - formation histories of the constituent galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the slope of the cmr encodes the build - up of the mass - metallicity relation , while its scatter is thought to reflect the variation in the formation epochs of the cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "mounting observational data has culminated in a picture of galaxy formation that attempts to explain the conversion of star - forming `` blue - cloud '' galaxies into passively - evolving `` red - sequence '' galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this picture cites some combination of the quenching of star formation in the blue - cloud and the merging of already red galaxies as driving the build - up of the red - sequence .",
    "the high resolution imaging delivered by hst / acs plays an important role in disentangling these effects , as it allows color measurements even for faint galaxies , and robust morphological measurements , which include either manual classification of e , s0 , sp , and irr ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or automated separation of e / s0 types from later types ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular , combined color and morphological data can be used to measure the color scatter of the e / s0 galaxies in the cmr , which places constraints on the formation epochs of stars in cluster galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    until now",
    ", @xmath5 systematic space - based studies of the cmr in the cores of galaxy clusters have been conducted almost exclusively using a handful of x - ray selected galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the consensus picture from these studies is that stars in these galaxies were formed at @xmath6 .    in this letter , we present the first precision statistical measurements of the scatter of the cmr in an optically - selected sample of galaxy clusters at @xmath7 . where necessary",
    ", we adopt a flat , @xmath8 cosmology with @xmath9 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "imaging for this study was acquired as part of the _ hst _ cluster sn survey program ( program number 10496 , pi : perlmutter ) .",
    "nine optically - selected clusters were imaged at various telescope roll angles for a total of 5000 - 16000s with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on multiple visits ( 375s-500s per sub - exposure ) in @xmath11 ( f850lp ) and for 1000 - 8000s in @xmath12 ( f775w ) @xcite .",
    "eight clusters are derived from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the ninth , xlss j0223.0 + 0436 , was originally included in this sample as an ir - detected cluster from the sparcs survey @xcite , but had previously been detected in both the ir @xcite and x - ray @xcite .",
    "we consider it here as an optical - ir detected cluster .",
    "with the exception rcsj j0337.8 - 2844 an extensive spectroscopic program has obtained 5 - 30 confirmed spectroscopic members per cluster , enough to compute a velocity dispersion in many cases @xcite .",
    "three of the x - ray selected clusters , analyzed most recently in @xcite are taken from @xcite , and the warps cluster was first presented in @xcite .    images for each cluster were coadded using multidrizzle @xcite , with a gaussian kernel , @xmath13 , and a final output pixel size of 0.03 arcsec / pixel .",
    "the detailed photometric and morphological pipelines developed for this work are described and tested in detail in @xcite . in brief ,",
    "object detection was performed with sextractor @xcite , and the resulting catalogs were manually cleaned of diffraction spikes , pupil ghosts , and saturated stars .",
    "the final galaxy catalog was distilled from the full catalog following @xcite .",
    "total magnitudes are taken as @xmath14 magnitudes with a correction applied ( e.g. , , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appropriate for e galaxies . as noted in @xcite , the differential smearing of the psf between @xmath12 and @xmath11 makes the psf approximately @xmath15 broader in @xmath11 .",
    "we correct this using a psf matching scheme that places both the @xmath12 and @xmath11 images on the same footing by convolving the latter image with the psf of the former , and vice - versa .",
    "the psf model was built in each bandpass using the sextractor @xmath16 parameters to select acceptable psf stars in the coadded images , which were then visually checked . in a circularly symmetric @xmath17 radius",
    ", a single psf model adequately describes the aggregate distortion realized in the final image due to hst / acs optics and temporal variations thereof @xcite , charge diffusion @xcite , the so - called red - halo effect @xcite , and the drizzling process . for the precision photometry required in this study ,",
    "this necessarily restricts us to considering the inner @xmath18 kpc of each cluster , where the psf is approximately constant , and the convolutions required for psf - matching are minimally position dependent .    in the coadded and",
    "convolved @xmath11 image of each cluster , we construct adaptively - determined apertures with @xmath19 @xcite by fitting sersic profiles constrained to @xmath20 , thus returning an estimate of an effective radius , @xmath21 for each object .",
    "nearby objects ( @xmath22 ) are simultaneously fit , and all remaining objects within @xmath23 are masked , and the sky estimated as in @xcite . the same aperture is applied in the @xmath12 band to measure the @xmath24 color .",
    "errors on the aperture magnitudes are determined for each galaxy by comparing the repeat observations of objects as a function of magnitude .",
    "typical errors range from 0.02 mags at @xmath25 to 0.05 magnitudes at @xmath26 .",
    "we use an automated scheme , @xmath27 @xcite to separate e / s0 galaxies from the irregulars and spirals , taking objects with a gini coefficient @xmath28 and asymmetry parameter @xmath29 to be e / s0 galaxies .",
    "because @xmath11 stays redward of the 4000   break until @xmath30 , the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for early - type galaxies remains considerable .",
    "based on comparison to the manual classifications for rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 in @xcite , the e / s0 galaxies we classify at @xmath31 comprise a @xmath32 pure and complete sample .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams were created for each cluster , and the red - sequence color limits were determined by eye .",
    "objects falling within these broad limits ( @xmath33 of the final best - fit line ) with luminosities greater than @xmath34 ( @xmath26 at @xmath35 ) were taken to be the red - sequence .",
    "the luminosity limit is strictly chosen to be bright enough to ensure the morphological classifications are robust .",
    "a line was fit to e / s0 objects within these bounds using a simple least - squares method , and was sigma - clipped at 3 @xmath36 in @xmath37 color .",
    "this was iterated until convergence to derive the slope and zero point of the best - fit line , and the scatter of e / s0 objects ( including the rejected outliers ) about this line was computed using a bi - weight estimator of scale @xcite .",
    "the best - fit slopes of two clusters , rcs j2156.7 - 0448 and rcs j2345.4 - 3632 , are not robust to the color cuts used , due largely to the relative paucity of e / s0 galaxies at the faint end of their cmrs ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we thus fix the slope for these clusters at @xmath39 and the reported scatter is measured about this line ; the resulting scatter about the best - fit line varies by only @xmath40 mags depending on the line used .    to assess uncertainties , we run 1000 bootstrap resamples on each cluster , and compute the mean and standard error of the red sequence fits to these resamples .",
    "there is a further contribution to scatter due to photometric error . using the method of @xcite",
    "we find that it contributes no more than 0.01 - 0.02 magnitudes in quadrature to the measured scatter ; we correct the measured scatters accordingly .",
    "finally , we note that the derived cmr is measured inside a fixed 0.5 @xmath41 mpc cluster - centric radius , the approximate observed field - of - view of most of these observations .",
    "we do not attempt to compute @xmath42 or any other scale radius , which would require additional dynamical data , x - ray data , or possibly wider field images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "table 1 shows the measured cmrs for our 9 optically - selected clusters and also our own measurements of a subset of archival x - ray selected clusters also measured in @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "the table also displays @xmath44 , the number of e / s0 galaxies used in measuring the cmr , and a richness @xmath45 , which is the number of red - sequence galaxies brighter than @xmath46 , within @xmath47 mpc of the bcg .",
    "rcs j0337.8 - 2844 and rcs j2156.7 - 0448 , the two least rich clusters , exhibit the largest scatter .",
    "rcs j2319.8 + 0038 and rcs j0439.6 - 2904 , which are both x - ray detected @xcite , and the x - ray selected clusters have relatively high @xmath45 richnesses .    in this letter",
    ", we focus on the distribution of scatters . in the observed frame ,",
    "it is apparent that the optical and x - ray samples have discordant average scatters in observed @xmath24 : the optical sample , at @xmath1 is nearly 50% larger than the x - ray scatter at @xmath2 .",
    "a @xmath48-test of the means of the two samples rejects the null hypothesis that the two samples come from the same underlying population at the 95% level .",
    "the scatter is thought to reflect variations in galaxy formation time ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "it has thus been modeled using bruzual - charlot single - burst models @xcite , which posit that all the stars in a given galaxy are formed in a coeval burst at some redshift , @xmath49 , and evolve passively thereafter .",
    "the scatter in the cmr results from the variation in formation times for the constituent galaxies that have formed in single bursts between reionization , @xmath50 , and some lower redshift , @xmath51 .",
    ", stars with error bars represent the scatter of the red - sequence in x - ray selected clusters , while the normal crosses and errors show the scatters for the optically - selected clusters .",
    "the best - fit bruzual - charlot single - burst models for the x - ray and optical samples are shown as dashed and solid lines , respectively .",
    "inset : @xmath52 minimization for the x - ray and optical models , indicating the lowest redshift , @xmath53 , of the epoch during which galaxies formed .",
    "the two samples clearly favor different minima in the context of this model . alternatively , taking @xmath54 in the x - ray sample , the @xmath55 , a result that is discordant with the optically - selected best - fit @xmath56 model at the few sigma level . ]    using the acs @xmath12 and @xmath11 response curves as described in @xcite , we determine the expected observed scatter in @xmath57 using a single - burst spectrum , following the monte carlo method first described in @xcite . assuming a galaxy formed at some redshift , @xmath49 , we create 10,000 `` galaxies '' by drawing from a random uniform formation age distribution corresponding to a redshift range of @xmath58 . for each @xmath51 , the last redshift at which galaxies formed",
    ", the model predicts a scatter in @xmath24 that would be observed at some redshift , @xmath59 . for a given set of clusters , we then choose the best - fit model by minimizing @xmath52 : @xmath60 where the `` mod '' and `` obs '' superscripts refer to the predicted model and observed data scatters , and @xmath61 is the error on each observed @xmath62 . in figure 1 , we show the result of this process for both the optical ( solid ) and x - ray ( dashed ) samples .",
    "the optical sample favors @xmath63 , and the x - ray sample favors @xmath64 , suggesting that the e / s0 galaxies on the red - sequence in x - ray selected clusters ended their star formation some 0.9 gyr earlier .",
    "the small number of e / s0 galaxies , @xmath44 , in some of the less rich clusters highlights a possible concern .",
    "simple monte carlo simulations of random draws from a normal distribution indicate that at @xmath65 , even the bi - weight estimator of scale returns a scatter that is biased high by 10% ; this is reduced to 3% by @xmath66 , and @xmath67 at n=40 .",
    "contamination by non - cluster members also contributes to scatter . randomly adding a single galaxy that passes the red - sequence color cuts adds as much as an additional 10% bias at @xmath65 .",
    "fortunately , our analysis of the goods@xcite fields indicate that the average background ( for morphologically selected galaxies passing our color and luminosity cuts ) is @xmath68 galaxy .",
    "another concern is line - of - sight projection of large structures .",
    "rcs j0439.6 - 2904 is known to show two redshift peaks at @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite , for a separation of @xmath71 km s@xmath10 .",
    "a cursory analysis of the halo catalogs from the virgo simulations @xcite shows that halo - halo projections of this sort are expected in about @xmath72 of rcs clusters in this mass range at @xmath5 ; a similar value is found in spectroscopic data @xcite . at such a separation ,",
    "monte carlo simulations show that two projected halos each with @xmath73 km s@xmath10 have a resultant measured scatter inflated by only @xmath74 magnitudes , which has no significant effect on our results .",
    "spectroscopy does not yet exist for rcs j0337.8 - 2844 and spectroscopic confirmation is pending . only limited spectroscopy exists for rcs j2156.7 - 0448 ( 5 confirmed spectroscopic members ) , and its measured x - ray flux is consistent with zero @xcite , although the strong lensing in this system @xcite indicates that its mass is cluster scale .",
    "regardless , we find that removing one or both of these clusters does not affect our conclusions .",
    "the other seven clusters are robustly spectroscopically confirmed @xcite .    for three of the x - ray clusters ( all except warp j1415.1 + 3612 ) ,",
    "@xcite place constraints on @xmath51 with single - burst models , using a combination of hst data , manual morphological measurements , and spectroscopic confirmation where available .",
    "they generally find formation epochs of @xmath75 , only slightly higher than our own measurements . as part of the validation process of our pipeline",
    ", we compare our measured cmr parameters in these 3 x - ray clusters with previous work , and find that they agree within errors .",
    "for the 4 optical clusters in this study that have velocity dispersion estimates , we find the distribution of velocity dispersions is similar to the x - ray sample , with the rcs clusters having @xmath78 km s@xmath10 , and the x - ray sample @xmath79 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the number of e / so galaxies ( table 1 ) suggests that the clusters in the x - ray sample are as rich as the richest optical clusters , and a @xmath48-test reveals no significant difference between richnesses of the two samples . additionally , the fact that we have run the same automated pipeline on all the clusters rules out systematic differences that might be expected in measurements conducted in different studies , or in different bandpasses .",
    "the observed difference in red - sequence scatters between the two samples therefore suggests that the galaxy populations in the clusters themselves are different . to test this further",
    ", we measure the composite red - sequence bulge - dominated ( e / s0 ) fraction in each sample as a function of cluster - centric radius , shown in figure 2 .",
    "both samples reach the goods field value by @xmath80 mpc .",
    "overplotted are best - fit regression lines estimated using @xmath81 @xcite , which both exhibit a significant correlation of the fraction with radius .",
    "the regression parameters themselves ( figure 2 , legend ) disagree at the @xmath82 level .",
    "this suggests that e / s0 galaxies form a larger fraction of the cores of x - ray clusters , and fall off faster than the optical clusters before reaching the field value . at lower redshifts",
    "the development of the morphology - density relation , particularly through the build - up of s0 galaxies on the red sequence , appears correlated with cluster age @xcite , and so these differences also suggest that the optical clusters are younger .",
    "we note however that the radii in figure 2 are metric , and it is not clear that these trends would be mitigated by the use of an aperture scaled to the virial radius .",
    "the similarity of the x - ray and optical velocity dispersions is , however , evidence that the virial radii are similar .",
    "the measurements presented in this study have consequences for studies of cluster evolution and galaxy formation .",
    "distant optically - selected clusters likely represent a younger state of massive halos compared to their x - ray selected counterparts . if cluster galaxies from the most highly - biased regions of the universe formed earlier in the x - ray sample , as suggested by our analysis , one might be tempted to conclude that the clusters themselves collapsed earlier , and that the presence of a hot icm reflects this more evolved state . in this scenario ,",
    "x - ray selected clusters only represent a subset of the most massive halos at @xmath5 , and optical samples fill out the part of the mass function that is younger , and not x - ray bright",
