    "financial bubbles are generally defined as transient upward acceleration of prices above fundamental value @xcite . however , identifying unambiguously the presence of a bubble remains an unsolved problem in standard econometric and financial economic approaches @xcite , due to the fact that the fundamental value is in general poorly constrained and it is not possible to distinguish between exponentially growing fundamental price and exponentially growing bubble price .    to break this stalemate , sornette and co -",
    "workers have proposed that bubbles are actually not characterized by exponential prices ( sometimes referred to as `` explosive '' ) , but rather by faster - than - exponential growth of price ( that should therefore be referred to as `` super - explosive '' ) .",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the reason for such faster - than - exponential regimes is that imitation and herding behavior of noise traders and of boundedly rational agents create positive feedback in the valuation of assets , resulting in price processes that exhibit a finite - time singularity at some future time @xmath0 .",
    "see @xcite for a general theory of finite - time singularities in ordinary differential equations , @xcite for a classification and @xcite for applications .",
    "this critical time @xmath0 is interpreted as the end of the bubble , which is often but not necessarily the time when a crash occurs @xcite .",
    "thus , the main difference with standard bubble models is that the underlying price process is considered to be intrinsically transient due to positive feedback mechanisms that create an unsustainable regime .",
    "furthermore , the tension and competition between the value investors and the noise traders may create deviations around the finite - time singular growth in the form of oscillations that are periodic in the logarithm of the time to @xmath0 .",
    "log - periodic oscillations appear to our clocks as peaks and valleys with progressively greater frequencies that eventually reach a point of no return , where the unsustainable growth has the highest probability of ending in a violent crash or gentle deflation of the bubble .",
    "log - periodic oscillations are associated with the symmetry of discrete scale invariance , a partial breaking of the symmetry of continuous scale invariance , and occurs in complex systems characterized by a hierarchy of scales .",
    "see @xcite for a general review and references therein .",
    "recent literatures on bubbles and crashes can be summarized as the following kinds : first , the combined effects of heterogeneous beliefs and short - sales constraints may cause large movements in asset . in this kind of models ,",
    "the asset prices are determined at equilibrium to the extent that they reflect the heterogeneous beliefs about payoffs .",
    "but short sales restrictions force the pessimistic investors out of the market , leaving only optimistic investors and thus inflated asset price levels . however , when short sales restrictions no longer bind investors , then prices fall back down @xcite . while in the second type , the role of `` noise traders '' in fostering positive feedback trading has been emphasized .",
    "these models says trend chasing by one class of agents produces momentum in stock prices @xcite .",
    "the empirical evidence on momentum strategies can be found in @xcite .",
    "after the discussion on bubbles and crashes , the literatures on rebound should be summarized also . on the theoretical side , there are several competing explanations for price decreases followed by reversals : liquidity and time - varying risk .",
    "@xcite stresses the importance of liquidity : as more people sell , agents who borrowed money to buy assets are forced to sell too . when forced selling stops , this trend reverses .",
    "@xcite shows that it is risky to be a fundamental trader in this environment and that price reversals after declines are likely to be higher when there is more risk in the price , as measured by volatility . on the empirical front concerning the forecast of reversals in price drops",
    ", @xcite shows that the simplest way to predict prices is to look at past performance .",
    "@xcite shows that price - dividend ratios forecast future returns for the market as a whole .",
    "however , these two approaches do not aim at predicting and can not determine the most probable rebound time for a single ticker of the stock .",
    "the innovation of our methodology in this respect is to provide a very detailed method to detect rebound of any given ticker .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the hypothesis that financial bubbles have mirror images in the form of `` negative bubbles '' in which positive feedback mechanisms may lead to transient accelerating price falls .",
    "we adapt the johansen - ledoit - sornette ( jls ) model of rational expectation bubbles @xcite to negative bubbles .",
    "the crash hazard rate becomes the rally hazard rate , which quantifies the probability per unit time that the market rebounds in a strong rally .",
    "the upward accelerating bullish price characterizing a bubble , which was the return that rational investors require as a remuneration for being exposed to crash risk , becomes a downward accelerating bearish price of the negative bubble , which can be interpreted as the cost that rational agents accept to pay to profit from a possible future rally . during this accelerating downward trend",
    ", a tiny reversal could be a strong signal for all the investors who are seeking the profit from the possible future rally .",
    "these investors will long the stock immediately after this tiny reversal . as a consequence , the price rebounds very rapidly .",
    "this paper contributes to the literature by augmenting the evidence for transient pockets of predictability that are characterized by faster - than - exponential growth or decay .",
    "this is done by adding the phenomenology and modeling of `` negative bubbles '' to the evidence for characteristic signatures of ( positive ) bubbles .",
    "both positive and negative bubbles are suggested to result from the same fundamental mechanisms , involving imitation and herding behavior which create positive feedbacks . by such a generalization within the same theoretical framework",
    ", we hope to contribute to the development of a genuine science of bubbles .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2.1 summarizes the main definitions and properties of the johansen - ledoit - sornette ( jls ) for ( positive ) bubbles and their associated crashes .",
    "section 2.2 presents the modified jls model for negative bubbles and their associated rebounds ( or rallies ) .",
    "the subsequent sections test the jls model for negative bubbles by providing different validation steps , in terms of prediction skills of actual rebounds and of abnormal returns of trading strategies derived from the model .",
    "section 3 describes the method we have developed to test whether the adapted jls model for negative bubbles has indeed skills in forecasting large rebounds .",
    "this method uses a robust pattern recognition framework build on the information obtained from the calibration of the adapted jls model to the financial prices .",
    "section 4 presents the results of the tests concerning the performance of the method of section 3 with respect to the advanced diagnostic of large rebounds .",
    "section 5 develops simple trading strategies based on the method of section 3 , which are shown to exhibit statistically significant returns , when compared with random strategies without skills with otherwise comparable attributes .",
    "section 6 concludes .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite developed a model ( referred to below as the jls model ) of financial bubbles and crashes , which is an extension of the rational expectation bubble model of @xcite . in this model , a crash is seen as an event potentially terminating the run - up of a bubble .",
    "a financial bubble is modeled as a regime of accelerating ( super - exponential power law ) growth punctuated by short - lived corrections organized according the symmetry of discrete scale invariance @xcite .",
    "the super - exponential power law is argued to result from positive feedback resulting from noise trader decisions that tend to enhance deviations from fundamental valuation in an accelerating spiral .    in the jls model ,",
    "the dynamics of stock markets is described as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the stock market price , @xmath3 is the drift ( or trend ) and @xmath4 is the increment of a wiener process ( with zero mean and unit variance ) .",
    "the term @xmath5 represents a discontinuous jump such that @xmath6 before the crash and @xmath7 after the crash occurs . the loss amplitude associated with the occurrence of a crash",
    "is determined by the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the assumption of the constant jump size is easily relaxed by considering a distribution of jump sizes , with the condition that its first moment exists .",
    "then , the no - arbitrage condition is expressed similarly with @xmath8 replaced by its mean .",
    "each successive crash corresponds to a jump of @xmath5 by one unit .",
    "the dynamics of the jumps is governed by a crash hazard rate @xmath9 .",
    "since @xmath10 is the probability that the crash occurs between @xmath11 and @xmath12 conditional on the fact that it has not yet happened , we have @xmath13   = 1 \\times h(t ) dt + 0 \\times ( 1- h(t ) dt)$ ] and therefore @xmath14 = h(t)dt~.    \\label{theyjytuj}\\ ] ] under the assumption of the jls model , noise traders exhibit collective herding behaviors that may destabilize the market .",
    "the jls model assumes that the aggregate effect of noise traders can be accounted for by the following dynamics of the crash hazard rate @xmath15 the intuition behind this specification ( [ eq : hazard ] ) has been presented at length in @xcite , among others , and further developed in ( sornette and johansen , 2002 ) for the power law part and by @xcite and ( zhou et al . , 2005 ) for the second term in the right - hand - side of expression ( [ eq : hazard ] ) . in a nutshell ,",
    "the power law behavior @xmath16 embodies the mechanism of positive feedback posited to be at the source of the bubbles .",
    "if the exponent @xmath17 , the crash hazard may diverge as @xmath11 approaches a critical time @xmath0 , corresponding to the end of the bubble .",
    "the cosine term in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : hazard ] ) takes into account the existence of a possible hierarchical cascade of panic acceleration punctuating the course of the bubble , resulting either from a preexisting hierarchy in noise trader sizes @xcite and/or from the interplay between market price impact inertia and nonlinear fundamental value investing @xcite .",
    "the no - arbitrage condition reads @xmath18=0 $ ] , where the expectation is performed with respect to the risk - neutral measure , and in the frame of the risk - free rate .",
    "this is the standard condition that the price process is a martingale . taking the expectation of expression ( [ eq : dynamic ] ) under the filtration ( or history ) until time @xmath11 reads @xmath19= \\mu(t ) p(t ) dt + \\sigma(t ) p(t ) { \\rm e}_t[dw ] - \\kappa p(t ) { \\rm e}_t[dj]~.   \\label{thetyjye}\\ ] ] since @xmath20 = 0 $ ] and @xmath21 = h(t)dt$ ] ( equation ( [ theyjytuj ] ) ) , together with the no - arbitrage condition @xmath18=0 $ ] , this yields @xmath22 this result ( [ tjyj4n ] ) expresses that the return @xmath23 is controlled by the risk of the crash quantified by its crash hazard rate @xmath9 .",
    "now , conditioned on the fact that no crash occurs , equation ( [ eq : dynamic ] ) is simply @xmath24 its conditional expectation leads to @xmath25 =   \\kappa h(t ) dt~.\\ ] ] substituting with the expression ( [ eq : hazard ] ) for @xmath9 and integrating yields the so - called log - periodic power law ( lppl ) equation : @xmath26 = a + b(t_c - t)^m + c(t_c - t)^m\\cos(\\omega\\ln ( t_c - t ) - \\phi ) \\label{eq : lppl}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "note that this expression ( [ eq : lppl ] ) describes the average price dynamics only up to the end of the bubble .",
    "the jls model does not specify what happens beyond @xmath0 .",
    "this critical @xmath0 is the termination of the bubble regime and the transition time to another regime .",
    "this regime could be a big crash or a change of the growth rate of the market .",
    "merrill lynch emu ( european monetary union ) corporates non - financial index in 2009 @xcite provides a vivid example of a change of regime characterized by a change of growth rate rather than by a crash or rebound . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the crash hazard rate accelerates up to @xmath0 but its integral up to @xmath11 which controls the total probability for a crash to occur up to @xmath11 remains finite and less than @xmath29 for all times @xmath30 .",
    "it is this property that makes it rational for investors to remain invested knowing that a bubble is developing and that a crash is looming .",
    "indeed , there is still a finite probability that no crash will occur during the lifetime of the bubble .",
    "the excess return @xmath31 is the remuneration that investors require to remain invested in the bubbly asset , which is exposed to a crash risk .",
    "the condition that the price remains finite at all time , including @xmath0 , imposes that @xmath32 .    within the jls framework ,",
    "a bubble is qualified when the crash hazard rate accelerates . according to ( [ eq : hazard ] )",
    ", this imposes @xmath17 and @xmath33 , hence @xmath34 since @xmath32 by the condition that the price remains finite .",
    "we thus have a first condition for a bubble to occur @xmath35 by definition , the crash rate should be non - negative .",
    "this imposes @xcite @xmath36      as recalled above , in the jls framework , financial bubbles are defined as transient regimes of faster - than - exponential price growth resulting from positive feedbacks .",
    "we refer to these regimes as `` positive bubbles . ''",
    "we propose that positive feedbacks leading to increasing amplitude of the price momentum can also occur in a downward price regime and that transient regimes of faster - than - exponential _ downward _ acceleration can exist .",
    "we refer to these regimes as `` negative bubbles . '' in a `` positive '' bubble regime , the larger the price is , the larger the increase of future price . in a `` negative bubble '' regime ,",
    "the smaller the price , the larger is the decrease of future price . in a positive bubble , the positive feedback results from over - optimistic expectations of future returns leading to self - fulfilling but transient unsustainable price appreciations . in a negative bubble ,",
    "the positive feedbacks reflect the rampant pessimism fueled by short positions leading investors to run away from the market which spirals downwards also in a self - fulfilling process .",
    "the symmetry between positive and negative bubbles is obvious for currencies .",
    "if a currency a appreciates abnormally against another currency b following a faster - than - exponential trajectory , the value of currency b expressed in currency a will correspondingly fall faster - than - exponentially in a downward spiral .",
    "in this example , the negative bubble is simply obtained by taking the inverse of the price , since the value of currency a in units of b is the inverse of the value of currency b in units of a. using logarithm of prices , this corresponds to a change of sign , hence the `` mirror '' effect mentioned above .",
    "the jls model provides a suitable framework to describe negative bubbles , with the only modifications that both the expected excess return @xmath23 and the crash amplitude @xmath8 become negative ( hence the term `` negative '' bubble ) .",
    "thus , @xmath3 becomes the expected ( negative ) return ( i.e. , loss ) that investors accept to bear , given that they anticipate a potential rebound or rally of amplitude @xmath37 .",
    "symmetrically to the case of positive bubbles , the price loss before the potential rebound plays the role of a random payment that the investors honor in order to remain invested and profit from the possible rally .",
    "the hazard rate @xmath9 now describes the probability per unit time for the rebound to occur . the fundamental equations ( [ eq : hazard ] ) and ( [ eq : lppl ] ) then hold mutatis mutandis with the inequalities @xmath38 being the opposite to those corresponding to a positive bubble as described in the preceding subsection .",
    "an example of the calibration of a negative bubble with the jls model ( 4 ) to the s&p 500 index from 1973 - 01 - 01 to 1974 - 10 - 01 is shown in the upper panel of figure 1 . during this period ,",
    "the s&p 500 index decreased at an accelerating pace .",
    "this price fall was accompanied by very clear oscillations that are log - periodic in time , as described by the cosine term in formula ( 4 ) .",
    "notice that the end of the decreasing market is followed by a dramatic rebound in index price .",
    "we hypothesize that , similar to a crash following an unsustainable super - exponential price appreciation ( a positive bubble ) , an accelerating downward price trajectory ( a negative bubble ) is in general followed by a strong rebound .",
    "furthermore , in order to suggest that this phenomenon is not an isolated phenomenon but actually happens widely in all kinds of markets , another example in the foreign exchange market is presented in the lower panel of figure 1 .",
    "the usd / eur change rate from 2006 - 07 - 01 to 2008 - 04 - 01 also underwent a significant drawdown with very clear log - periodic oscillations , followed by a strong positive rebound .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to identify such regions of negative bubbles in financial time series and then use a pattern recognition method to distinguish ones that were ( in a back - testing framework ) followed by significant price rises .    in financial markets ,",
    "large positive returns are less frequent than large negative returns , as expressed for instance in the skewness of return distributions . however , when studying drawdowns and drawups ( i.e. , runs of same sign returns ) .",
    "johansen and sornette found that , for individual companies , there are approximately twice as many large rallies as crashes with amplitude larger than 20% with durations of a few days @xcite .",
    "we adapt the pattern recognition method of @xcite to generate predictions of rebound times in financial markets on the basis of the detection and calibration of negative bubbles , defined in the previous section .",
    "we analyze the s&p 500 index prices , obtained from yahoo !",
    "finance for ticker ` gspc ' ( adjusted close price ) .",
    "the start time of our time series is 1950 - 01 - 05 , which is very close to the first day when the s&p 500 index became available ( 1950 - 01 - 03 ) .",
    "the last day of our tested time series is 2009 - 06 - 03 .",
    "we first divide our s&p 500 index time series into different sub - windows @xmath39 of length @xmath40 according to the following rules :    1 .",
    "the earliest start time of the windows is @xmath41 1950 - 01 - 03 .",
    "other start times @xmath42 are calculated using a step size of @xmath43 calendar days . 2 .",
    "the latest end time of the windows is @xmath44 2009 - 06 - 03 .",
    "other end times @xmath45 are calculated with a negative step size @xmath46 calendar days .",
    "the minimum window size @xmath47 calendar days .",
    "the maximum window size @xmath48 calendar days .",
    "these rules lead to 11,662 windows in the s&p 500 time series .    for each window , the log of the s&p 500 index is fit with the jls equation ( [ eq : lppl ] ) .",
    "the fit is performed in two steps .",
    "first , the linear parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are slaved to the non - linear parameters by solving them analytically as a function of the nonlinear parameters .",
    "we refer to @xcite ( page 238 and following ones ) , which gives the detailed equations and procedure .",
    "then , the search space is obtained as a 4 dimensional parameter space representing @xmath51 .",
    "a heuristic search implementing the tabu algorithm @xcite is used to find initial estimates of the parameters which are then passed to a levenberg - marquardt algorithm @xcite to minimize the residuals ( the sum of the squares of the differences ) between the model and the data .",
    "the bounds of the search space are : @xmath52 \\label{eq : rangem}\\\\    \\omega & \\in & [ 0.01 , 40 ] \\\\",
    "\\phi & \\in & [ 0.001 , 2\\pi]\\\\\\label{eq : rangetc }    t_c & \\in & [ t_2 , t_2 + 0.375(t_2 - t_1)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we choose these bounds because @xmath53 has to be between @xmath54 and @xmath29 according to the discussion before ; the log - angular frequency @xmath55 should be greater than @xmath54 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath56 is large enough to catch high - frequency oscillations ( though we later discard fits with @xmath57 ) ; phase @xmath58 should be between 0 and @xmath59 ; as we are predicting a critical time in financial markets , the critical time should be after the end of the time series we are fitting",
    ". finally , the upper bound of the critical time should not be too far away from the end of the time series since predictive capacity degrades far beyond @xmath45 .",
    "we have empirically found elsewhere @xcite one - third of the interval width to be a good cut - off .    the combination of the heuristic and optimization results in a set of parameters @xmath60 and @xmath0 for each of the 11,662 windows . of these parameter sets ,",
    "2,568 satisfy the negative bubble condition ( [ eq : rb ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fg : histo ] , we plot the histogram of critical time @xmath0 for these negative bubble fits and the _ negative _ logarithm of the s&p 500 time series . peaks in this time series , then , indicate minima of the prices , many of these peaks being preceded by a fast acceleration with upward curvature indicating visually a faster - than - exponential growth of @xmath61 .",
    "this translates into accelerating downward prices .",
    "notice that many of these peaks of @xmath62 are followed by sharp drops , that is , fast rebounds in the regular @xmath63 .",
    "we see that peaks in @xmath62 correspond to peaks in the negative bubble @xmath0 histogram , implying that the negative bubbles qualified by the jls model are often followed by rebounds .",
    "this suggests the possibility to diagnose negative bubbles and their demise in the form of a rebound or rally .",
    "if correct , this hypothesis would extend the proposition @xcite , that financial bubbles can be diagnosed before their end and their termination time can be determined with an accuracy better than chance , to negative bubble regimes associated with downward price regimes .",
    "we quantify this observation below .",
    "the aim is first to recognize different patterns in the s&p 500 index from the 11,662 fits and then use the subset of 2,568 negative bubble fits to identify specific negative bubble characteristics .",
    "these characteristics will then be used to ` predict ' ( in a back - testing sense ) negative bubbles and rebounds in the future .",
    "we first define a rebound , note as @xmath64 .",
    "a day @xmath65 is a rebound @xmath64 if the price on that day is the minimum price in a window of 200 days before and 200 days after it .",

    "we find 19 rebounds of the @xmath68-days type in the 59 year s&p 500 index history .",
    "our task is to diagnose such rebounds in advance .",
    "we could also use other numbers instead of 200 to define a rebound .",
    "the predictability is stable with respect to a change of this number .",
    "this is because we learn from the learning set with a certain number type of rebounds and try to predict the rebounds of the same type .",
    "later we will also show the results for @xmath69-days type of rebounds .",

    "if this critical time is within @xmath74 days of a rebound , then we assign fit @xmath72 to class i , represented by the symbol @xmath75 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath72 is assigned to class ii , represented by the symbol @xmath76 . for this study",
    ", we chose @xmath77 days because @xmath74 too big will lose precision and @xmath74 too small will take the noise into account . in this case , class i fits are those with @xmath0 within 10 days of one of the 19 rebounds .",
    "we formalize this rule as : @xmath78 to be clear , class i is formed by all the fits in learning set @xmath70 which have a critical time @xmath0 within 10 days of one of the rebounds .",

    "these 6 parameters are @xmath82 and @xmath83 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lppl ] ) , @xmath84 ( the negative bubble condition ) from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bg0 ] ) and @xmath85 as the residual of the fit .",
    "we categorize these sets of 6 parameters for fits which are in the same group and same class .",
    "then for each class - group combination , we calculate the probability density function ( pdf ) of each parameter using the adaptive kernel method @xcite , generating 168 pdfs ( 6 parameters @xmath86 2 classes @xmath86 14 groups ) .",
    "we compare the similarity ( defined below ) of the pdfs of each of the six parameters that are in the same group ( window length ) but different classes ( proximity of @xmath0 to a rebound date ) .",
    "if these two pdfs are similar , then we ignore this parameter in this group .",
    "if the pdfs are different , we record this parameter of this group as an _ informative parameter_. the maximum number of possible informative parameters is 84 ( 6 parameters @xmath86 14 groups ) .",
    "we use the kolmogorov - smirnov method @xcite to detect the difference between pdfs .",
    "if the maximum difference of the cumulative distribution functions ( integral of pdf ) between two classes exceeds 5% , then this is an informative parameter .",
    "we want to assign a uniquely determined integer @xmath87 to each informative parameter .",

    "these regions play a crucial role in the generation of questionnaires in the next section .",
    "our hypothesis is that many `` positive '' and `` negative bubbles '' share the same structure described by the jls model , because they result from the same underlying herding mechanism .",
    "however , nothing a priori imposes that the control parameters should be identical .",
    "note that our pattern recognition methodology specifically extract the typical informative parameter ranges that characterize the `` negative bubbles '' .",

    "note that the choice ( 10 , 200 ) is somewhat arbitrary and does not constitute an in - sample optimization on our part .",
    "this can be checked from the error diagrams presented below , which scan these numbers : one can observe in particular that the pair ( 10 , 200 ) does not give the best performance .",
    "we have also investigated the impact of changing other parameters and find a strong robustness .    with this feature qualification ,",
    "the rebound alarm index can distinguish rebounds with high significance .",
    "if the first number @xmath162 is too big and the second number @xmath163 is too small , then the total number of class i features will be very small and the number of features in class ii will be large .",

    "the comparison of this rebound alarm index with the historical financial index ( figure  [ fg : p2212 ] ) shows a good correlation , but there are also some false positive alarms ( 1977 , 1998 , 2006 ) , as well as some false negative missed rebounds ( 1990 ) .",
    "many false positive alarms such as in 1998 and 2006 are actually associated with rebounds . but these rebounds have smaller amplitudes than our qualifying threshold targets . concerning the false negative ( missed rebound ) in 1990 , the explanation is probably that the historical prices preceeding this rebound does not follow the jls model specification .",
    "rebounds may result from several mechanisms and the jls model only provides one of them , arguably the most important .",
    "overall , the predictability of the rebound alarm index shown in figure  [ fg : p2212 ] , as well as the relative cost of the two types of errors ( false positives and false negatives ) can be quantified systematically , as explained in the following sections .",

    "we have qualitatively seen that the feature qualifications method using back testing and forward prediction can generate a rebound alarm index that seems to detect and predict well observed rebounds in the s&p 500 index .",
    "we now quantify the quality of these predictions with the use of error diagrams @xcite .",
    "we create an error diagram for predictions after 1975 - 01 - 01 with a certain feature qualification in the following way :    1 .",

    "there are 12,600 points in this series and the sorting operation delivers a list of 12,600 index values , from the largest to the smallest one .",
    "the largest value of this sorted series defines the first threshold .",
    "4 .   using this threshold , we declare that an alarm starts on the first day that the unsorted rebound alarm index time series exceeds this threshold .",
    "the duration of this alarm @xmath181 is set to 41 days , since the longest distance between a rebound and the day with index greater than the threshold is 20 days .",
    "then , a prediction is deemed successful when a rebound falls inside that window of 41 days .",
    "if there are no successful predictions at this threshold , move the threshold down to the next value in the sorted series of alarm index .",
    "once a rebound is predicted with a new value of the threshold , count the ratio of unpredicted rebounds ( unpredicted rebounds / total rebounds in set ) and the ratio of alarms used ( duration of alarm period / 12,600 prediction days ) .",
    "mark this as a single point in the error diagram .    in this way , we will mark 9 points in the error diagram for the 9 rebounds .",
    "the aim of using such an error diagram in general is to show that a given prediction scheme performs better than random .",
    "a random prediction follows the line @xmath182 in the error diagram .",
    "a set of points below this line indicates that the prediction is better than randomly choosing alarms .",
    "the prediction is seen to improve as more error diagram points are found near the origin ( 0 , 0 ) .",
    "the advantage of error diagrams is to avoid discussing how different observers would rate the quality of predictions in terms of the relative importance of avoiding the occurrence of false positive alarms and of false negative missed rebounds . by presenting the full error diagram",
    ", we thus sample all possible preferences and the unique criterion is that the error diagram curve be shown to be statistically significantly below the anti - diagonal @xmath182 .    in figure [ fg:22p ] , we show error diagrams for different feature qualification pairs @xmath167 .",
    "note the 9 points representing the 9 rebounds in the prediction set .",
    "we also plot the 11 points of the error diagrams for the learning set in figure [ fg:22b ] .    as a different test of the quality of this pattern recognition procedure",
    ", we repeated the entire process but with a rebound now defined as the minimum price within a window of @xmath183 days instead of @xmath184 days , as before .",

    "we use predictions near the end of november , 2008 as an example . from figure",
    "[ fg : p2212 ] , we can see there is a strong rebound signal in that period .",
    "we determine if this is a true rebound signal by the following method :    1 .",

    "calculate @xmath186 , the number of days in the interval from 1975 - 01 - 01 until the end of the prediction set , 2009 - 07 - 22 .",
    "calculate @xmath187 , the number of days which have a rebound alarm index greater than or equal to @xmath185 .",
    "the probability that the rebound alarm index is higher than @xmath185 is estimated by @xmath188 5 .",
    "the probability of a day being near the bottom of a rebound is estimated as the number of days near real rebounds over the total number of days in the predicting set : @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the number of rebounds we can detect after 1975 - 01 - 01 and @xmath191 is the rebound width , i.e. the number of days near the real rebound in which we can say that this is a successful prediction . for example , if we say that the prediction is good when the predicted rebound time and real rebound time are within 10 days of each other , then the rebound width @xmath192 .",
    "the probability that the neighbor of a rebound has a rebound alarm index larger than @xmath185 is estimated as @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the number of rebounds in which @xmath195 7 .",
    "given that the rebound alarm index is higher than @xmath185 , the probability that the rebound will happen in this period is given by bayesian inference : @xmath196    averaging @xmath197 for all the different feature qualifications gives the probability that the end of november 2008 is a rebound as 0.044 . by comparing with observations",
    ", we see that this period is not a rebound .",
    "we obtain a similar result by increasing the definition of rebound from 200 days before and after a local minimum to 365 days , yielding a probability of 0.060 .    when we _ decrease _ the definition to 100 days , the probability that this period is a rebound jumps to 0.597 .",
    "the reason for this sudden jump is shown in figure  [ fg : bn08 ] where we see the index around this period and the s&p 500 index value . from the figure",
    ", we find that this period is a local minimum within 100 days , not more .",
    "this is consistent with what bayesian inference tells us .",
    "however , we have to address that the more obvious rebound in march 2009 is missing in our rebound alarm index . technically , one can easily find that this is because the end of crash is not consistent with the beginning of rebound in this special period .",
    "in this case , we then test all the days after 1985 - 01 - 01 systematically by bayesian inference using only prediction data ( rebound alarm index ) after 1975 - 01 - 01 . to show that the probability that @xmath198 is stable , we can not start bayesian inference too close to the initial predictions so we choose 1985 - 01 - 01 as the beginning time .",
    "we have 5 ` bottoms ' ( troughs ) after this date , using the definition of a minimum within @xmath68 days .    for a given day @xmath65 after 1985 - 01 - 01 , we know all values of the rebound alarm index from 1975 - 01 - 01 to that day .",
    "then we use this index and historical data of the asset price time series in this time range to calculate the probability that @xmath65 is the bottom of the trough , given that the rebound alarm index is larger than @xmath185 , where @xmath185 is defined as @xmath199    to simplify the test , we only consider the case of feature qualification pair ( 10 , 200 ) , meaning that the trait is a feature of class i only if it shows in class i more than 10 times and in class ii less than 200 times",
    ". figure [ fg : bayes ] shows that the actual rebounds occur near the local highest probability of rebound calculated by bayesian inference .",
    "this figure also illustrates the existence of false positive alarms , i.e. , large peaks of the probability not associated with rebounds that we have characterized unambiguously at the time scale of @xmath68 days .",
    "in order to determine if the predictive power of our method provides a genuine and useful information gain , it is necessary to estimate the excess return it could generate . the excess return is the real return minus the risk free rate transformed from annualized to the duration of this period .",
    "the annualized 3-month us treasury bill rate is used as the risk free rate in this paper .",
    "we thus develop a trading strategy based on the rebound alarm index as follows .",
    "when the rebound alarm index rises higher than a threshold value @xmath200 , then with a lag of @xmath201 days , we buy the asset .",
    "this entry strategy is complemented by the following exit strategy .",
    "when the rebound alarm index goes below @xmath200 , we still hold the stock for another @xmath202 days , with one exception .",
    "consider the case that the rebound alarm index goes below @xmath200 at time @xmath42 and then rises above @xmath200 again at time @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath203 is smaller than the holding period @xmath202 , then we continue to hold the stock until the next time when the rebound alarm index remains below @xmath200 for @xmath202 days .",
    "the performance of this strategy for some fixed values of the parameters is compared with random strategies , which share all the properties except for the timing of entries and exits determined by the rebound alarm index and the above rules .",
    "the random strategies consist in buying and selling at random times , with the constraint that the total holding period ( sum of the holding days over all trades in a given strategy ) is the same as in the realized strategy that we test . implementing 1000 times these constrained random strategies with different random number realizations provide the confidence intervals to assess whether the performance of our strategy can be attributed to real skill or just to luck",
    ".    results of this comparison are shown in table  [ tb : performance ] for two sets of parameter values .",
    "the p - value is a measure of the strategies performance , calculated as the fraction of corresponding random strategies that are better than or equal to our strategies .",
    "the lower the p - value is , the better the strategy is compared to the random portfolios .",
    "we see that all of our strategies cumulative excess returns are among the top 5 - 6% out of 1000 corresponding random strategies cumulative excess returns .",
    "box plots for each of the strategies are also presented in figures  [ fg : bp1]-[fg : bp2 ] .",
    "the cumulative returns as well as the cumulative excess returns obtained with the two strategies as a function of time are shown in figures  [ fg : wt1]-[fg : wt2 ] .",
    "these results suggest that these two strategies would provide significant positive excess return . of course , the performance obtained here are smaller than the naive buy - and - hold strategy , consisting in buying at the beginning of the period and just holding the position .",
    "the comparison with the buy - and - hold strategy would be however unfair as our strategy is quite seldom invested in the market .",
    "our goal here is not to do better than any other strategy but to determine the statistical significance of a specific signal .",
    "for this , the correct method is to compare with random strategies that are invested in the market the same fraction of time .",

    "the higher the sharpe ratio is , the higher the excess return under the same risk .",

    "the average sharpe and bias ratios of these random trades are shown in table  [ tb : performance ] .",
    "both sharpe and bias ratios of our strategies are greater than those of the random trades , confirming that our strategies deliver a larger excess return with a stronger asymmetry towards positive versus negative returns .    as another test",

    "performance metrics have been presented in the form of error diagrams , of bayesian inference to determine the probability of rebounds and of trading strategies derived from the rebound alarm index dynamics .",
    "these different measures suggest that the rebound alarm index provides genuine information and suggest predictive ability .",
    "the implemented trading strategies outperform randomly chosen portfolios constructed with the same statistical characteristics .",
    "this suggests that financial markets may be characterized by transient positive feedbacks leading to accelerated drawdowns , which develop similarly to but as mirror images of upward accelerating bubbles .",
    "our key result is that these negative bubbles have been shown to be predictably associated with large rebounds or rallies .    in summary",

    "the present paper contributes to improving our understanding of the most dramatic anomalies exhibited by financial markets in the form of extraordinary deviations from fundamental prices ( both upward and downward ) and of extreme crashes and rallies .",
    "our results suggest a common underlying origin to both positive and negative bubbles in the form of transient positive feedbacks leading to identifiable and reproducible faster - than - exponential price signatures .",
