    ", such deformations can couple to the migration velocity , which influences the single - particle properties @xcite as well as their collective behavior @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations of deformable self - propelled particles are , for instance , migrating cells and self - propelled droplets on rigid surfaces @xcite .",
    "moreover , activated droplets may self - propel over liquid surfaces and through bulk fluids @xcite , which implies induced fluid flows and thus classifies them as deformable microswimmers .",
    "an interaction with imposed surrounding flow fields becomes important when rheological properties of active systems are considered @xcite , when the features of self - propelled microswimmers are exploited in microfluidic devices @xcite , or when microorganisms orient themselves in external shear flows @xcite .",
    "recently , the theoretical studies of the influence of deformability @xcite and of external flow fields @xcite have been combined , when the behavior of deformable self - propelled particles in a linear shear flow @xcite and in a swirl flow @xcite has been analyzed . together with a possible self - spinning motion @xcite , deformability leads to a multitude of new dynamic states implying different types of winding and cycloidal trajectories , periodic and quasi - periodic motions , or chaotic states @xcite .",
    "the corresponding model equations , especially the couplings between deformation and migration velocity @xcite as well as between deformation and the external flow @xcite , are introduced using symmetry arguments , leaving the coupling parameters largely undetermined .",

    "one could also start directly with a more resolved model that explicitly contains the flow field around each finitely sized model swimmer for this purpose .",
    "however , when many such microswimmers interact with each other , the situation becomes increasingly complicated , requiring complex particle- and flow - resolved simulation approaches @xcite .    to cure the missing links in the coupling between finite extension , deformability , and gradients of external flow fields , yet still on a readily accessible level of low complexity , we propose simple minimal bead - spring model microswimmers .",

    "we introduce our simple deformable bead - spring model microswimmers in section [ model ] .",
    "after that , the simplest realizations of this model in the form of a two - bead , three - bead , and four - bead microswimmer are analyzed in sections [ twobead ] , [ threebead ] , and [ fourbead ] , respectively , in the presence of an externally imposed swirl flow .",

    "finally , we summarize our results and conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "first , we specify our simplified deformable model microswimmers . in our minimal approach , the swimmer body is discretized into an arrangement of @xmath0 identical spherical beads labeled by an index @xmath1 .",
    "each bead is exposed to frictional forces when it moves relatively to the surrounding fluid with a friction coefficient @xmath2 ; here @xmath3 is the fluid viscosity and @xmath4 the hydrodynamic radius of the beads .",
    "the spherical beads are linked to each other by harmonic springs of spring constant @xmath5 .",
    "these springs have finite extension in the undeformed state , which implies a nonzero extension of the deformable microswimmer in its motionless ground state . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on microswimmers composed of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 beads , referred to as @xmath0-bead swimmers ( @xmath0-bs ) .     in the undeformed state ( @xmath10 for the diagonal springs in the square ) .",
    "the objects are referred to as @xmath0-bead swimmers ( @xmath0-bs ) , where here @xmath11 . in the active case ,",

    "the @xmath7-bs represents a linear object , the @xmath8-bs an equilateral triangle , and the @xmath9-bs a square .",
    "all springs feature a length @xmath15 in the undeformed state , except for the additional diagonal springs of undeformed lengths @xmath10 that counteract shear deformations of the square .    in the active case ,",
    "one of the beads , labeled by an index @xmath16 , features an active drive @xmath12 . for @xmath13 , we let the unit vector @xmath14 point towards the center of mass of all other ( passive ) beads .",
    "thus , the orientation of the active drive @xmath17 is set within the body frame of each deformable swimmer and is not imposed from outside .",
    "each swimmer is therefore an autonomous self - driven entity .",
    "@xmath18 sets the strength of the active drive , while the unit vector @xmath14 and the sign of @xmath19 determine the direction and orientation of the active drive . for @xmath20",
    ", the active drive is oriented `` inward '' , therefore the active bead `` pushes '' the other beads .",
    "in contrast to that , for @xmath21 , the active drive points `` outward '' , thus the active bead `` pulls '' on the remainder of the swimmer .",
    "typically , the dynamics of microswimmers is restricted to the regime of low reynolds numbers @xcite .",
    "therefore we consider an overdamped type of dynamics .",
    "combining all these ingredients , we find the following equation of motion for the @xmath1-th bead : @xmath22 on the left - hand side , this equation lists the linear viscous friction of the @xmath1-th bead with its fluid environment .",

    ", we will not consider situations that would make it necessary to introduce steric interactions between the beads .",
    "furthermore , we neglect possible couplings between rotations of the beads and spring deformations @xcite . in this investigation",
    ", we study the dynamic behavior of such model microswimmers in two spatial dimensions .",
    "experimentally , this could be realized by tracking the motion of such swimmers on the surface of a liquid .",
    "another option would be to confine the motion of microswimmers to the interface between two immiscible fluids . within the accessible two - dimensional area",
    ", we consider a prescribed flow field @xmath24 given by @xmath31 in polar coordinates .",
    "it describes a swirl flow around the origin , with @xmath32 for @xmath33 , corresponding to an incompressible fluid flow .",

    "the study of this particular flow field offers two major advantages . on the one hand , and in contrast to the often analyzed linear shear profile @xcite , a swirl flow can easily be realized experimentally . in the simplest case",
    ", a swirl can be induced in a cylindrical cavity of sufficient diameter and height by a rotating magnetic stir bar at the bottom of the vessel . on the other hand ,",
    "a previous theoretical investigation of a different deformable swimmer model has already demonstrated rich dynamics in this situation @xcite . in that previous study",
    ", extensional contributions of the surrounding fluid flow could induce deformations of the swimmer .",
    "however , the microswimmer itself was approximated as a point - like object . in the present model",
    ", we consider a finite extension of our swimmers within the gradient of the externally imposed flow field .",
    "as we will demonstrate , this leads to qualitatively new types of behavior .",

    "[ fig : passive2bs ] . due to the finite extension of the swimmer",

    "( the words `` front '' and `` rear '' mark the positions with respect to the convection direction given by the swirl ) .",
    "a situation with the active bead at the rear is not stable .",
    "first , due to the active drive , the active bead becomes faster and tends to overtake the passive bead .",
    "second , when it does so , due to the secant geometry it pushes towards regions of higher swirl flow velocity , which further adds to the overtaking procedure . in the end , we find the active bead at the front for @xmath20 .",
    "the opposite case of @xmath21 is likewise very intuitive",
    ". then the active drive points away from the swimmer center .",
    "in this situation , again considering the forward - convection by the swirl , the active bead sits at the rear .",
    "it slows the swimmer convection .",

    "[ fig : active_2bs ] .",

    "the active @xmath7-bs is safe from getting drowned in the swirl .",
    "next , we turn to the @xmath8-bs .",

    ", the @xmath8-bs shows a characteristic opposite behavior when compared to the @xmath7-bs in that it gets drawn into the swirl .",

    "our description remains meaningful only for distances @xmath72 larger than the extension of the microswimmer .",
    "the reason for the observed undertow is the finite extension of the swimmer together with its deformability . along its extension , the swimmer experiences the gradient of the imposed swirl flow .",
    "inner beads are convected quicker on narrower paths of higher curvature around the swirl center than outer beads . for geometric reasons ,",
    "this difference in speeds of convection together with the curved trajectories leads to an approach of the center of mass towards the swirl center .",
    "that simple picture best applies , if the beads are convected rather independently of each other , i.e.  for small spring constants @xmath5 .",

    "[ fig : separatrix ] confirms that initial locations closer to the swirl center lead to capturing while more remote initial positions allow an escape .",
    "the non - circular shape of the area of capturing events highlights the role of the initial orientation of the active drive .",
    "our approach introduces a simplified procedure to construct and investigate well - defined finitely sized model microswimmers in external flow fields .",

    "the strength of the active drive @xmath19 is high enough so that the swimmer over time increases its distance from the swirl center . during this process",
    "we can observe an inversion of the sense of rotation of the egg - shaped orbit , similarly to the case of the @xmath8-bs in fig .",
    "[ fig : volute ] .",
    "however , in our example of the @xmath9-bs in fig .",
    "[ fig : drehungs_aenderung4bs ] , the drift of the swimmer is outwards instead of inwards .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : drehungs_aenderung4bs ] a change of rotational sense oppositely to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : volute ] .",
    "it is our understanding that the observed peculiarities , particularly the drag towards the swirl center and the net orientational drifts , result from the non - vanishing extension of our regular bead - spring microswimmers .",
    "thus we expect that other regular bead - spring swimmers composed of a higher number of beads ( @xmath106 ) show analogous behavior as found for the @xmath8-bs and the @xmath9-bs . yet , this hypothesis and the detailed influence of additional beads and springs will have to be clarified in the future .",
    "as a benefit of our simplified paradigmatic approach , effects resulting from the finite extension and deformability of the swimmers are readily isolated and identified . for instance , due to the finite spatial extension , the gradients in the surrounding external flow field are directly sensed by the swimmers with important consequences .",
    "one example is that @xmath0-bss with @xmath107 and weak active drive are drawn into the swirl .",
    "this effect has not been found in a previous model @xcite , where the finite spatial extension of the swimmer has not been taken into account .    in the following , we list some possible extensions of our minimal model .",
    "it is straightforward to include additional features of realistic systems , which in more elaborate models often requires high computational effort .",
    "for instance , one could take into account thermal fluctuations of the beads in the present model .",
    "corresponding stochastic noise terms then must be added to eq .",
    "( [ eq_motion_unscaled ] ) .",
    "we performed some first tests and naturally found that the trajectories get noisy , but , as long as the fluctuations are not too strong , qualitatively the same effects as described above can be observed .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that also fluctuations of the external flow field should then be taken into account , which requires further knowledge of the specific set - up .    moreover , hydrodynamic interactions between the beads of the swimmer could be included .",
    "these depend on the boundary conditions under consideration . for passive swimmers , within the bulk of a fluid , and for large enough spatial separation of the beads with respect to their size",
    ", hydrodynamic interactions are readily described by oseen tensors to lowest order @xcite .",
    "we have performed according tests and found that hydrodynamic interactions increase on average the degree of deformation in the flow gradient .",
    "close to surfaces , the description of hydrodynamic interactions changes @xcite .",
    "so far , we have only investigated the two - dimensional motion of our model microswimmers , and only planar swimmer geometries were considered .",
    "naturally , our concept is easily extended to propulsion in three spatial dimensions , including the effect of imposed three - dimensional flow fields .",
    "tetrahedral model microswimmers would represent the simplest three - dimensional bead - spring swimmer geometries .",
    "moreover , the behavior of less regular swimmer structures could be analyzed , with different bead sizes and thus different hydrodynamic friction constants , varying spring stiffnesses , and varying undeformed spring lengths , or different strengths of self - propulsion of individual beads on the same microswimmer .",
    "in summary , we introduced simplified bead - spring model microswimmers and investigated their behavior in a circular swirl flow .",
    "the colloidal beads are connected by harmonic springs , and in the active case one of the beads experiences an active drive .",
    "a linear swimmer consisting of two beads aligns with the flow lines and is circularly convected around the swirl .",
    "an active drive slowly transports it radially outwards . for a three - bead microswimmer , a small rotational drift together with tiny orientational oscillations",
    "are observed while being convected around the swirl .",
    "the circular orbit around the swirl is deformed to an egg - like shape when an active drive is switched on .",
    "small net rotations of this egg - shaped orbit are observed , leading to rosette - like trajectories . for low enough magnitude of the active drive",
    ", the swimmer is drawn towards the swirl center .",
    "remarkably , the sense of rotation of the egg - shaped orbit can reverse during this process . for",
    "higher magnitudes of active drive , we distinguish between capturing and scattering events by the swirl , if the swimmer is initially heading towards the swirl . aspects of this behavior persist for a swimmer consisting of four beads , with certain variations .",
    "this opens the space for further investigations in the future on deformable multi - bead microswimmers",
    ".    it should be possible to analyze the behavior of the proposed types of microswimmers experimentally .",
    "colloidal particles can be effectively connected to each other using dna fragments as linkers @xcite .",
    "an active drive can be imposed when an appropriate self - propelling janus particle @xcite is inserted instead of one of the other passive colloidal particles .",
    "different geometries in the form of the investigated two- , three- , and four - bead swimmers could be realized in this way . in the simplest case , a two - dimensional motion results when the swimmer is confined to the two - dimensional surface of a fluid .",
    "we chose the circular swirl flow as an externally imposed fluid flow because it should be easily implemented experimentally .",
    "in principle , a cylindrical cavity with a steadily rotating magnetic stir bar at the bottom can be used in a first attempt .",
    "our approach may serve as a simplified paradigmatic model to describe the behavior of more complex deformable self - propelled microswimmers in external flow fields .",
    "examples are self - propelled droplets @xcite .",
    "this possible connection should be further probed and tested in the future .    on the theoretical side",
    ", the simple model microswimmer shall be a starting point for our future investigations of the collective behavior of many interacting deformable swimmers .",
    "for this purpose , additional steric inter - swimmer interactions must be imposed to avoid unphysical overlaps . in such a situation",
    ", our model will show its strength : all interactions , hydrodynamic and steric , together with thermal fluctuations and finite extensions of the individual swimmers can be formulated consistently .",
    "simultaneously , the model is simple enough to handle a collection of many interacting particles .",
    "this shall inspire direct particle - based computer simulations or the derivation of corresponding statistical theories .",
    "a variant of our model also currently under investigation are `` active colloidal polymers '' @xcite . in this case , many colloidal particles are linked to a linear chain .",
    "two cases are analyzed in this context .",
    "on the one hand , the chain can be made of passive colloidal particles placed into a background of self - propelling microswimmers @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the chain itself could be composed of self - propelling janus particles @xcite .",
    "naturally , also combinations of the two cases , or chains that are only partially active , can be studied in analogy to our simplified finitely - sized model microswimmers ."
