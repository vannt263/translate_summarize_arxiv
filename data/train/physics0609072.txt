    "the @xmath8 state in divalent atoms and ions is the first excited state above the @xmath9 ground state .",

    "if @xmath13 the hyperfine interaction mixes levels with different @xmath14 and , consequently , the @xmath11 level acquires a finite lifetime .",
    "this hyperfine quenching has been treated theoretically for be - like , mg - like and zn - like ions @xcite .",
    "theoretical work on neutral alkaline - earth - metal atoms @xcite was motivated by the idea to use the hyperfine induced @xmath15 transition in ultraprecise atomic clocks . in another application the @xmath16c@xmath17(@xmath15 )",
    "fluorescence from planetary nebulae was measured to infer the @xmath16c/@xmath18c abundance ratio and , thereby , to gain insight into stellar nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "so far , the only experimental values for @xmath19 hyperfine induced ( hfi ) transition rates were obtained for in@xmath20 ( @xmath21=5 ) @xcite stored in a radio frequency trap and for be - like n@xmath22 from astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "although the latter result had a rather large uncertainty of @xmath23 , it allows one to discriminate between the two theoretical values @xcite that are available for this ion and that differ by almost a factor of 4 . in view of these theoretical uncertainties",
    "it is evident that accurate experimental benchmarks are highly desirable , especially for few electron systems such as be - like ions where correlation effects are particularly strong .    in the present work the hyperfine quenching of the @xmath24 state of",
    "be - like @xmath7ti@xmath1 was observed in dielectronic recombination ( dr ) experiments carried out at the heavy - ion storage - ring tsr of the max - planck - institute for nuclear physics in heidelberg , germany . the procedure for obtaining the associated decay constant from electron - ion recombination measurements is outlined .",
    "the result will be published elsewhere @xcite . here ,",
    "the ti@xmath1 recombination spectrum is presented and its isotope - dependence is discussed .",
    "mass selected @xmath25ti@xmath1 ion beams ( natural abundances 7.2% and 73.7% , respectively ) were provided by a tandem accelerator , followed by a radio frequency linear accelerator , at energies close to 240 mev , using a fixed magnetic setting for the beam line and the storage ring .",
    "in one straight section of the storage ring the ion beam was continuously phase - space cooled using the velocity - matched electron beam of the tsr electron cooler . in a second straight section , the ion beam was merged with the collinear electron beam of the high - resolution electron target @xcite , run at variable acceleration voltage in order to set the required collision energy in the co - moving reference frame of the ions .",
    "the target electron beam temperatures were @xmath26  @xmath27ev and @xmath28  mev .",
    "ti@xmath29 ions formed by electron - ion recombination in the electron target or by charge transfer in collisions with residual gas molecules were deflected out of the closed orbit of the circulating ti@xmath1 ion beam in the first dipole magnet downstream of the electron target and were directed onto a scintillation detector operated in single - particle counting mode with nearly 100% detection efficiency .",
    "recombination spectra of the ti@xmath1 ions as a function of the relative electron - ion energy were taken by varying the cathode voltage of the electron target appropriately . the procedure for electron - ion measurements at the tsr storage ring has been described in more detail in , e.g. , ref .",

    "the spectrum is similar to the previously measured ones of the isoelectronic ions cl@xmath33 @xcite and fe@xmath34 @xcite . at higher energies",
    "it is dominated by the regular rydberg series of @xmath35 dr resonances converging to the @xmath36 series limit at 73.11  ev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 series limits are barely visible .",
    "they are expected to occur at 35.73 , 37.77 , and 43.05  ev for @xmath38 , 1 , and 2 , respectively . at lower energies",
    "the spectrum is more irregular due to the larger fine - structure splitting of the lower-@xmath21 resonances .",
    "some resonance features , e.g. , at 23.6 and 34.0  ev can be related to @xmath5 core double - excitations .",

    "the @xmath49 and @xmath50 levels of the ti@xmath1(@xmath51 term have theoretical lifetimes of 74  ns and 1  ms , respectively @xcite , much shorter than the average storage lifetime ( @xmath3050 s ) .",
    "thus , the major fraction of the initially present metastable ions decayed to the ground state very fast on the time scale of the experiment , and the remaining ( infinitely ) long - lived @xmath11 metastable fraction amounted to only @xmath305% ( see below ) . in the single - pass experiments , however , typical flight times were of the order of several @xmath27s , i.e. , much shorter than the lifetimes of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 states . for lower charged ions",
    "these lifetimes are even larger than the values given above , e.g. 0.16  ms ( theoretical value @xcite ) for the f@xmath44(@xmath54 ) state , so that even the fastest decaying @xmath52 component of the @xmath48 term was contained in the primary beams of the single - pass experiments .",

    "theoretical calculations using the autostructure code @xcite were performed @xcite to assign the weaker structures to the metastables .",
    "additionally , the calculations indicate an average population of @xmath305% for the metastable ti@xmath1(@xmath56 ) ions in the stored @xmath0ti@xmath1 beam .    using a @xmath7ti@xmath1 beam the resonances assigned to metastable ti@xmath1(@xmath56 ) ions essentially disappear [ fig.[fig : quenching](b ) ] .",
    "their average population is strongly reduced through the @xmath57 hfi radiative decay .",
    "the isotope - dependent occurrence of resonances in a dr spectrum was also observed in earlier tsr experiments , using the heavier divalent ion pt@xmath58 ( zn - like ) @xcite .",
    "here , resonances due to @xmath59 were seen for @xmath60pt@xmath58 and disappeared for @xmath61pt@xmath58 .",
    "a measurement of the optical decay lifetime , predicted to be 0.2971  ms @xcite , was not attempted as , in contrast to the present case , it should be much shorter than the time needed for electron cooling of the ion beam . in the present case of @xmath7ti@xmath1 the theoretical value for the hfi decay rate of the @xmath11 state is @xmath62  s @xcite so that a sizeable @xmath11 fraction can be expected in the ion beam even after cooling for some 100 ms .    for the experimental determination of @xmath63 the decay of the @xmath7ti@xmath1(@xmath11 ) beam component was monitored as a function of storage time . to this end",
    "the relative electron - ion energy in the electron target was set fixed to 0.75  ev where the @xmath64 dr resonance associated with excitation of the @xmath11 state occurs ( figure [ fig : quenching ] ) .",
    "after injection of a single ti@xmath1 ion pulse into the storage ring the recombination rate was recorded for up to 200  s. prior to the injection of the next pulse the remaining ions were kicked out of the ring .",
    "this scheme was repeated for a sufficient number of times to reduce statistical uncertainties to a level as low as achievable within one week of beam time .",
    "this method had been applied previously for measuring the slow radiative decay rates of @xmath65 states in the he - like ions ( b@xmath22 , c@xmath43 , n@xmath44 @xcite and li@xmath66 @xcite )",
