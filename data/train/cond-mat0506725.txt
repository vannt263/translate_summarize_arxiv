    "many complex systems are characterized by the network of interactions among its components .",
    "it has been shown that most of the networks are highly heterogeneous in their connectivity patterns .",
    "heterogeneity can be easily identified by looking at the degree distribution @xmath1 , which gives the probability of having a node with @xmath2 links .",
    "most complex networks can be described by degree distributions @xmath0 , with @xmath3 .",
    "these networks include social networks(such as movie - actor networks , science citations and cooperation networks ) , the internet and the world wide web , metabolic networks and protein interaction networks , etc @xcite .    since albert _ et al .",
    "_ raised the question of random failures and intentional attack on networks @xcite , enormous interest has been devoted to the study of the resilience of networks to failures of nodes or to intentional attacks @xcite .",
    "magoni studied a general strategy of attacks on the internet @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand how to design networks which are optimally robust against both failures and attacks .",
    "most of researchers use percolation theory to study this problem @xcite .",
    "a fraction @xmath4 of the nodes and their connections are removed randomly@xmath5the integrity might be compromised : for @xmath6 , there exists a certain threshold value @xmath7 . when @xmath8 , the network disintegrates into smaller , disconnected parts . below that critical threshold value",
    ", there still exists a connected cluster . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the networks are more resilient and the threshold value @xmath7 approaches 1 @xcite . also , some researchers work on optimizing network robustness to both random failures and attacks with percolation theory @xcite .",
    "a simple but essential character of scale - free network is its heterogeneous link distribution .",
    "moreover , heterogeneity is in direct relationship with the network s resilience to attacks .",
    "many real - world networks are scale - free and they are robust to random failures but vulnerable to targeted attacks .",
    "heterogeneity can be measured by entropy @xcite .",
    "used entropy of the remaining degree and mutual information to study some model networks of different heterogeneity and randomness @xcite .    in this paper , different from percolation theory",
    ", we try an alternative point of view@xmath5the entropy of the degree distribution to describe scale - free network s heterogeneity . to determine the optimal design of scale - free network to random failures , we maximize the robustness of scale - free network to random failures while keeping the cost constant ( that is , the average number of links per node remains constant ) .",
    "we find that optimization of scale - free network s robustness to random failures is equivalent to maximize the entropy of the degree distribution . by optimizing the entropy of the degree distribution",
    ", we get the scenario of optimal design of scale - free network to random failures .",
    "in general , scale - free networks have the degree distributions @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the minimal connectivity and @xmath12 is an effective connectivity cutoff present in finite networks .",
    "then the entropy of the degree distribution can be defined as follows :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the total number of nodes in the network and the restriction to the degree distribution is @xmath0 . within the context of complex networks",
    ", the entropy of the degree distribution provides an average measure of network s heterogeneity , since it measures the diversity of the link distribution @xcite .",
    "two extreme cases are the maximal value and the minimal one .",
    "the maximum value is @xmath15 obtained for @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 occurs when @xmath18 .    for the power - law degree distribution of scale - free network ,",
    "the impact of diversity ( long tails ) is obvious , increasing the uncertainty . as the scaling exponent increases or the cut - off decreases",
    ", the network becomes less heterogeneous and as a result a lower entropy is observed @xcite .    in this paper , we study the entropy of the degree distribution for scale - free networks . with continuous approximation , for the power law degree distribution of scale - free network",
    ", entropy @xmath19 can be expressed as follows :    @xmath20\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\frac{c\\log{c}}{1-\\alpha}\\cdot{(k^{1-\\alpha}-m^{1-\\alpha})}+\\frac{c\\alpha}{1-\\alpha }    \\cdot[\\log{k}\\cdot{k^{1-\\alpha}}-\\log{m}\\cdot{m^{(1-\\alpha)}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\cdot{(k^{1-\\alpha}-m^{1-\\alpha})}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the largest connectivity @xmath21 @xcite , the coefficient @xmath22 is obtained from    @xmath23    and thus    @xmath24    then entropy @xmath19 can be expressed as a function of scaling exponent @xmath25 , the minimal connectivity @xmath11 and network scale @xmath14 .    @xmath26    fig .",
    "1 displays the relationship between entropy @xmath19 and @xmath25 for different @xmath14 when the minimal connectivity @xmath11 is defined .    we know that with the increase of scaling exponent @xmath25 , the cut - off connectivity @xmath12 decreases , which makes the network less heterogeneous . as a result , a lower entropy is observed .",
    "so different scaling exponent @xmath25 brings the network different degree of heterogeneity .",
    "the average connectivity @xmath27 is obtained with continuous approximation ,    @xmath28    and thus    @xmath29    according to the above results , we can formulate the scale - free network s resilience to random failures problem as the following nonlinear mixed integer programming .",
    "@xmath30    the problem mentioned above is different from the usual maximizing the entropy of the network problem .",
    "note that the highest entropy for a network with a given @xmath27 is exponential random graph @xcite . to get the optimal design of scale - free networks , we restrict the degree distribution to be a power - law distribution .",
    "the problem can be rewritten as follows :    @xmath31    by solving the mixed integer programming problem , we get the optimal value @xmath19 , the optimal solutions @xmath25 and @xmath11 for different average connectivity @xmath27 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    from fig .",
    "2 , we can see that , in general , with the increase of average connectivity @xmath27 , entropy @xmath19 as well as the minimal connectivity @xmath11 increases , too . in part",
    ", the optimal minimal connectivity @xmath11 keeps constant for a certain range of @xmath27 , where scaling exponent @xmath25 decreases with the increase of @xmath27 . as a result ,",
    "the optimal network becomes much more heterogeneous than the one with bigger scaling exponent .    to prove the entropy of the degree distribution is indeed an effective measure of network robustness under node removal",
    ", we examine the relationship between the entropy of the degree distribution and the network threshold value @xmath7 , which was presented by cohen _",
    "with percolation theory @xcite .",
    "the criterion to calculate the percolation critical threshold value @xmath7 of a randomly connected network is :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is calculated from the original distribution before the random failures . with @xmath34 , @xmath35 can be expressed as follows :    @xmath36    in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath7 is calculated from the optimal value @xmath25 and @xmath11 which are obtained from maximizing @xmath19 for different average connectivity @xmath27 .",
    "the results indicate that for some constant @xmath11 , @xmath7 increases with the increase of @xmath27 .",
    "since both @xmath25 and @xmath14 affect network s resilience to random failures , we may ask how the network s robustness changes with @xmath14 .",
    "we just examine the relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath25 for different @xmath14 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4 .    from fig .",
    "4 , we can see that with the increase of @xmath25 , @xmath7 decreases , while the threshold value @xmath7 becomes bigger with the increase of network scale @xmath14 , which are consistent with the results shown in fig.1 .    to get an intuitive understanding of the relationship between the two measures ,",
    "we show the results of the threshold value @xmath7 and @xmath19 for different average connectivity @xmath27 in fig .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath7 and @xmath19 vary consistently , that is , @xmath7 increases with @xmath19 for different average degree @xmath27 . also , with the increase of @xmath27 , both @xmath7 and @xmath19 get improved .",
    "in real - world networks one is often interested in the question of how to design a robust network while keeping the cost constant .",
    "it is well known that scale - free networks are resilient to random failures for their heterogeneous links distributions .    in this paper , different from percolation theory to evaluate the threshold value @xmath7",
    ", we use the entropy of the degree distribution to study the resilience of scale - free networks to random failures .",
    "heterogeneity is a simple but essential character of scale - free networks and it is in direct relationship with the network s resilience to random failures .",
    "this character motivates us to use the entropy of the degree distribution , which provides an average measure of heterogeneity to study the effect of random failures on scale - free networks . by optimizing the entropy of the power - law degree distribution",
    ", we get the optimal value of entropy @xmath19 , the optimal solutions of @xmath25 and @xmath11 for different @xmath27 .",
    "the results indicate that when the network scale @xmath14 is given , the optimal solution @xmath11 is constant for a certain range of @xmath27 , in which range the scaling exponent @xmath25 decreases .",
    "so a higher entropy is obtained .",
    "of course , large average connectivity brings high cost .",
    "we then examine the relationship between threshold value @xmath7 and @xmath14 for different @xmath25 .",
    "the results are also consistent with that of the entropy of the degree distribution .",
    "we also show the relationship of the two measures@xmath5@xmath7 and @xmath19 .",
