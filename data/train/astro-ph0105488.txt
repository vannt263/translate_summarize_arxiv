    "magnetic fields permeate most astrophysical systems . in particular galaxies carry magnetic fields of the order of @xmath0gauss . in spirals",
    "such fields follow closely the density waves , which strongly suggests that galactic magnetic fields are sustained by a dynamo mechanism .",
    "the galactic dynamo combines the turbulent motion of ionized gas with the differential galactic rotation to amplify exponentially a week seed field up to dynamical equipartition value .",
    "this seed field should be coherent over the dimensions of the largest turbulent eddy ( @xmath1100 pc ) or else it may destabilize the dynamo action . moreover , in order to produce the observed galactic fields the seed field has to be stronger that a critical value . for a spatially - flat",
    ", dark - energy dominated universe the required strength may be as low as ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the origin of such a field remains elusive .",
    "attempts to generate @xmath2 astrophysically via vorticity or battery effects require large - scale separation of charges i.e. substantial ionization , which is hard to realize as late as galaxy formation .",
    "thus , the origin of the seed field is most likely primordial .",
    "since it breaks isotropy the generation of large - scale magnetic fields has to occur out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , before decoupling , magnetogenesis is possible either _ at phase transitions _ or _ during inflation _ ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "because phase transitions occur very early in the universe history the comoving size of the particle horizon is rather small .",
    "thus , since magnetogenesis mechanisms are causal , the resulting magnetic field is too incoherent . on the other hand ,",
    "inflation is possibly the only way one can achieve superhorizon correlations .",
    "however , the conformal invariance of electromagnetism forces the magnetic field to satisfy flux conservation _ during _ inflation ( @xcite ) . as a result",
    "the strength of the generated magnetic field is exponentially suppressed due to the rapid inflationary expansion of the universe .",
    "we show that natural magnetogenesis during inflation can occur due to the breaking of the conformal invariance of the @xmath3-boson field of the standard model , which also contributes to the formation of large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the resulting seed field is sufficient to trigger the galactic dynamo and explain the observations in a model - independent way .",
    "we will use a negative signature metric and units such that .",
    "inflationary theory is so successful that it may be considered as part of the standard model of cosmology .",
    "indeed , inflation manages with a single stroke to solve the horizon , flatness and monopole problems of the standard hot big bang ( shbb ) , while successfully providing the seeds for the formation of large scale structure ( i.e. the distribution of galactic clusters and superclusters ) and for the observed anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",

    "therefore , the scale factor is , i.e. the universe engages into a de - sitter exponential expansion phase .    during the inflationary expansion any pre - existing thermal bath",
    "is drastically diluted and the temperature of the universe is , i.e. the universe is supercooled .",

    "unfortunately , this is not effective for conformally invariant gauge fields , such as the photon , since they do not couple to the inflating gravitational background .",
    "however , this is not so for the @xmath3-boson of the standard model ( sm ) , which may also contribute into magnetic field generation .",
    "indeed , due to supercooling , the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry is broken during inflation and , therefore , the @xmath3-boson field is massive .",
    "the existence of a non - zero mass @xmath4 breaks conformal invariance and , consequently , @xmath3 is gravitationally generated on superhorizon scales . however , at the end of inflation reheating typically restores the ew - symmetry ( ) and the @xmath3-boson is projected onto the hypercharge giving rise to a hypermagnetic field with superhorizon correlations . after the ew - transition",

    "after their exit , the fluctuations cease to be causally self - correlated and can not collapse back into the vacuum , that is , they become from virtual , real classical objects .",
    "the energy of such particle generation is provided by the false vacuum energy driving inflation .",
    "consider such a @xmath3-boson fluctuation .",
    "since the fluctuation is quantum - generated it is subject to the uncertainty relation ,    @xmath7    because , typically , the fluctuation is not suppressed before reaching the horizon and , also , the field can be considered to be effectively massless .",
    "thus , the energy density of its fluctuation is mainly kinetic , .",
    "now , at horizon crossing . also , the time required for the fluctuation to reach and exit the horizon is . finally , because of the random nature of quantum fluctuations ( there is no coherent motion ) we may identify .",
    "the above suggest , that .",
    "in fact the amplitude of the fluctuation when exiting the horizon is set by the gibbons - hawking temperature , .",
    "this can be understood if the particle horizon during inflation is viewed as the event horizon of an inverted ( i.e. inside - out ) black hole , in the sense that nothing can escape being `` sucked '' _ out_. the above suggest ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the moment of horizon crossing .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuation at horizon crossing is independent of @xmath9 due to the self - similarity of de - sitter spacetime ( all dynamical scales , such as @xmath5 , stay constant ) .",

    "we get ,    @xmath11    since the fluctuation in question is quantum - generated inside the horizon it is causally connected at birth .",
    "therefore , it can be taken to be smooth and homogeneous , when exiting the horizon .",
    "its subsequent , superhorizon evolution should not affect its comoving spatial distribution because of the symmetries of the metric ( remember that , after exiting the horizon , the fluctuation becomes causally disconnected ) .",
    "thus , the initial homogeneity is expected to be preserved during the superhorizon evolution .",

    "now , since the photon production during inflation is negligible , _ the hypercharge spectrum is simply a projection of the @xmath3-spectrum _ , i.e. .",
    "the hypercharge is a massless , abelian gauge field , which obeys the analog of maxwell s equations .",
    "the associated hypermagnetic field is defined as , so that , at the end of inflation we have ,    @xmath27    due to the high conductivity of the reheated plasma , _ the hypermagnetic field gets frozen in and evolves satisfying flux conservation _ ,",
    "i.e. . on the other hand",
    ", the relevant hyperelectric component decays being debye screened .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field associated with the three @xmath28 gauge fields of the sm , which are also gravitationally produced during inflation , is screened by the existence of a thermal mass , due to the self - coupling of the non - abelian @xmath29-boson fields .",
    "as the universe continues to expand it cools down .",
    "when the temperature drops below the ew energy scale the ew - symmetry is broken again and the photon is formed by @xmath30 and the non - abelian @xmath31-boson ,    @xmath32    since the @xmath29-bosons are screened , their amplitude is negligible compared to the hypercharge .",
    "thus , the spectrum of the photon reflects that of the hypercharge , i.e .. therefore , _ at the ew - phase transition , the hypermagnetic field transforms into a regular magnetic field _ as ,    @xmath33    at first sight , it may strike as unlikely that a magnetic field is obtained from the gravitational production of the @xmath3-boson , which is orthogonal to the photon .",
    "in fact , the situation is analogous to that of light polarizers ( fig .  2 ) .",
