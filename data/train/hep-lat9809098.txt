    "accurate knowledge of the properties of the stationary states of glue in the presence of the simplest of color sources , that of a static quark and antiquark separated by some distance @xmath0 , is an important stepping stone on the way to understanding confinement .",
    "it is generally believed that at large @xmath0 , the linearly - growing ground - state energy of the glue is the manifestation of the confining flux whose fluctuations can be described in terms of an effective string theory .",
    "the lowest - lying excitations are then the goldstone modes associated with spontaneously - broken transverse translational symmetry .",
    "expectations are less clear for small @xmath0 .",
    "even the simplest property , the energy spectrum , of the stationary states of glue interacting with a static quark - antiquark pair is not accurately known .",
    "the main goal of this work is to remedy this . here",
    ", we present , for the first time , a comprehensive determination of the low - lying spectrum of gluonic excitations in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair . in this initial study , the effects of light quark - antiquark pair creation are ignored .",
    "a few of the energy levels for @xmath0 less than 1 fm have been studied before@xcite .",
    "our results for these quantities have significantly improved precision , and we have extended the range in @xmath0 to 4 fm .",
    "most of the energy levels presented here have never been studied before . some of our results were previously reported@xcite .",
    "the determination of the energies of glue in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair is also the first step in the born - oppenheimer treatment of conventional and hybrid heavy - quark mesons@xcite .",
    "the validity of the born - oppenheimer expansion depends , in part , on the smallness of retardation effects . in order to quantify such effects for the first time , mass splittings for various conventional and hybrid heavy - quark mesons obtained from the leading born - oppenheimer approximation",
    "are compared to those determined in simulations in which the heavy quark propagates according to a spin - independent nonrelativistic action .",
    "we adopt the standard notation from the physics of diatomic molecules and use @xmath3 to denote the magnitude of the eigenvalue of the projection @xmath4 of the total angular momentum @xmath5 of the gluons onto the molecular axis @xmath6 .",
    "the capital greek letters @xmath7 are used to indicate states with @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the combined operations of charge conjugation and spatial inversion about the midpoint between the quark and the antiquark is also a symmetry and its eigenvalue is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "states with @xmath10 are denoted by the subscripts @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "there is an additional label for the @xmath13 states ; @xmath13 states which are even ( odd ) under a reflection in a plane containing the molecular axis are denoted by a superscript @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the low - lying levels are labelled @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and so on . for convenience",
    ", we use @xmath24 to denote these labels in general .    .simulation parameters , including the coupling @xmath25 , input aspect ratio @xmath26 , lattice size , and the spatial link smearing parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the approximate lattice spacings @xmath29 , calculated assuming @xmath30 mev , are also given .",

    "the spectrum of gluon excitations in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair was comprehensively surveyed for separations @xmath0 ranging from 0.1 to 4 fm .",
    "our results raised serious doubts on the validity of treating glue in terms of a fluctuating string for @xmath0 less than 2 fm .",
    "for @xmath0 between 2 and 4 fm , some tantalizing signatures of goldstone mode formation were observed , but discrepancies still remain .",
    "we are currently studying the role of the spatial fixation or clamping of the quark and antiquark sources in distorting the goldstone mode spectrum .",
    "future studies of the excitation spectrum of the periodically - closed flux are planned .",
    "lastly , retardation effects in quarkonium were found to be sufficiently small to validate the born - oppenheimer expansion .",
