    "the geometrization of physical theories is a successful and challenging area in theoretical physics .",
    "the most well known examples are hamiltonian mechanics based on symplectic geometry , general relativity based on semi - riemannian geometry and classical yang - mills theory which uses fibre bundles @xcite .",
    "geometric ideas have also found a clear utility in non - relativistic quantum mechanics problems because quantum theory can be formulated in the language of hamiltonian phase - space dynamics @xcite .",
    "hence , the quantum theory has an intrinsic mathematical structure equivalent to hamiltonian phase - space dynamics .",
    "however , the underlying phase - space is not the same space of classical mechanics , but the space of quantum mechanics itself , i.e. , the _ space of pure states _ or the _ space of mixed states_.    unlike general relativity or gauge theory where the metric tensor or the connection are related with the physical interaction , the most usual geometric formulation of the geometry of non - relativistic quantum mechanics is not dynamic , in the sense that is insensitive to changes in the hamiltonian of the system . under these assumptions , that approach only makes use of the differential structure of the hilbert space for quantum states and the fubini - study metric .",
    "see for example the geometric interpretation of berry s phase @xcite .    from a more dynamical point of view",
    ", a. kryukov@xcite has stated that the schrdinger equation and throughout this paper we use the natural units system ( @xmath0 ) ] for a pure state @xmath1 ( plank s constant is set equal to @xmath2 ) @xmath3 can be considered as a geodesic flow in a certain riemannian manifold with an accurate metric which depends on the hamiltonian of the system .    the goal of this paper is to generalize the work of kryukov for mixed states . to this end , we provide an underlying differential manifold to describe mixed states and a dynamic - dependent riemannian metric tensor to analyze their temporal evolution .",
    "the mixed states are characterized by density matrices and the equation which plays the role of the schrdinger one is the von neumann equation @xcite    @xmath4\\quad.\\ ] ]    to obtain the underlying differential manifold following the uhlmann s geometrization for non - relativistic quantum mechanics@xcite , we make use of a principal fibre bundle such that its base manifold is the space of mixed states . finally , to provide the riemannian metric we choose an appropriate metric in the principal bundle , in such a way that the projection of the geodesic flow in the principal manifold to the base manifold is just the temporal evolution given by the von neumann equation .    among the geometric properties that are observed due to the movement of this geodesic flow , in this paper we analyze the phase volume conservation according to the liouville theorem . that allow us to show a geometric proof of the poincare recurrence theorem relating it with the recurrence principle for physical systems with discrete energy levels .",
    "let us emphasize that our geometric proof for the quantum poincare recurrence is closer to the classical mechanics proof@xcite ( that also uses the conservation of the volume in the phase - space evolution ) than the previous given in the quantum setting@xcite .",
    "the most general state , the so - called _ mixed state _ , is represented by a _ density operator _ in the hilbert space @xmath5 . in this paper we always assume that dim@xmath6 , being @xmath5 a vector space on the complex field ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the density operator @xmath8 is in fact a _",
    "density matrix_. recall that a density matrix is a complex matrix @xmath8 that satisfies the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath8 is a hermitian matrix , i.e , the matrix coincides with its conjugate transpose matrix : @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath8 is positive @xmath10 .",
    "it means that any eigenvalue of @xmath11 is non - negative .",
    "@xmath8 is normalized by the trace @xmath12 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath13 the space of mixed quantum states .",
    "note that the space of pure states @xmath14 is just @xmath15    recall that the space of quantum pure states has an elegant interpretation as a @xmath16-fibre bundle @xmath17 .",
    "following uhlmann @xcite and bengtsson and chruscinski books @xcite , we can use a similar argument to the case of quantum pure states .",
    "the key idea of uhlmann s approach is to lift the system density operator @xmath8 , acting on the hilbert space @xmath5 , to an extended hilbert space @xmath18    in quantum information theory @xcite , the procedure of extension , @xmath19 is known as attaching an ancilla living in @xmath5 . obviously , the space of squared matrices @xmath20",
    "( @xmath21 rows , @xmath21 columns ) over @xmath22 ( that is a @xmath23 real dimensional manifold ) can be identified with @xmath24 @xmath25    since @xmath26 is a smooth function in the space of squared matrices , by the regular level set theorem @xcite , the set @xmath27 is a smooth manifold of @xmath20 . actually , it is not hard to see that @xmath28 is diffeomorphic to the sphere @xmath29 . if @xmath8 is a mixed state in @xmath13 , we shall denote an element @xmath30 a _ purification _ of @xmath8 if @xmath31 therefore , we get the space of density matrices @xmath13 by the projection @xmath32 , where the projection is given by @xmath33    observe that , if @xmath34 is an unitary matrix ( i.e , @xmath35 ) then @xmath36    moreover , to fix notation recall that the lie group @xmath37 is a _ _ lie transformation group__@xcite acting on @xmath28 on the right . in general , a principal fibre bundle@xcite will be denoted by @xmath38 , being @xmath39 the _ total space _ ,",
    "@xmath40 the _ base space _ , @xmath41 the _ structure group _ and @xmath42 the _",
    "projection_. for each @xmath43 , @xmath44 is a closed submanifold of @xmath39 , called the _ fibre _ over @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath46 is a point of @xmath47 , then @xmath47 is the set of points @xmath48 , and it is called fibre through @xmath46 .    at this point ,",
    "an important question to answer , is if @xmath49 is a principal fibre bundle over the base manifold @xmath13 of density matrices .",
    "unfortunately the answer is no , because @xmath37 does not act freely on @xmath28 . in general , @xmath50 for @xmath30 and @xmath51 do not imply that @xmath52 , but observe that if @xmath53 ( i.e , @xmath54 is an invertible matrix ) @xmath37 would act freely on our space .",
    "this should be the way to describe the space of density matrices .",
    "instead of starting with @xmath20 , we start with the subset of invertible matrices . that subset has the differentiable structure of the lie group @xmath55 .",
    "then , we build a submanifold @xmath56 of @xmath55 given by @xmath57    finally , we obtain the base manifold @xmath58 using the projection @xmath59 given by @xmath60 and therefore , @xmath61 becomes a principal fibre bundle .",
    "observe that @xmath62 contains only strictly positive ( or faithful ) density operators .",
    "but @xmath13 can be recovered from @xmath58 by continuity arguments@xcite .",
    "in short , we describe the geometry of density matrices as a base manifold of a principal fibre bundle consisting of a submanifold @xmath56 of the lie group @xmath63 diffeomorphic to the sphere @xmath29 as a total space and the lie group @xmath37 as structure group .",
    "since @xmath61 admits a global section is well defined because a positive operator admits a unique positive square root .",
    "it is a section because @xmath64 . ]",
    "@xmath66 therefore @xmath61 is a trivial bundle from a topological point of view , that means that@xcite",
    "in this section , we define a riemannian metric for dynamics systems and we study how this metric acts within the tangent vector space of @xmath56 . we also discuss its relationship with other metrics such as the bures metric or the metric proposed by kryukov @xcite .      in order to provide explicit expressions for tangent vectors to @xmath56 and the metric tensor , we identify the tangent space @xmath68 with @xmath20 itself . since our total space @xmath56 is a submanifold of the manifold @xmath20 ,",
    "where each point @xmath69 is a matrix , and the tangent space @xmath70 to @xmath56 in the point @xmath54 is a subspace of the tangent space @xmath68 .",
    "we can use a matrix to describe a point @xmath69 and a matrix to describe a tangent vector @xmath71 too .",
    "first of all , note that the hamiltonian operator @xmath72 induces a vector field @xmath73 on @xmath56 given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the vector field in the point @xmath69 , i.e , @xmath76 .",
    "that vector field @xmath77 will be denoted as the _ hamiltonian vector field_.    for any point @xmath69 , and any two tangent vectors @xmath78 , we define the _ dynamic riemannian metric _ @xmath79 as @xmath80    it will be denoted by @xmath81 the levi - civita connexion ( the sole metric torsion free connexion ) given by @xmath82 . in the definition ( [ 3_2 ] ) we use @xmath83 assuming that @xmath72 is an invertible matrix , but that in fact makes no restriction on the hamiltonian of the system because we can set @xmath84 without changing the underlying physics .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath82 defines a positive definite inner product in each tangent space @xmath70 , being therefore @xmath82 a riemannian metric .    with that metric tensor @xmath82",
    "the ( sub)manifold @xmath85 becomes a riemannian manifold . in order to fix the notation we denote @xmath86 the _ shg - quantum fibre bundle of dimension _ @xmath21 .",
    "the rest of this section will examine the inherited metric in the base manifold ( theorem 1 ) from the dynamic metric in the principal manifold and its relation with other metrics .",
    "the tangent space @xmath70 at the point @xmath69 can be decomposed in its horizontal @xmath87 and vertical @xmath88 subspaces : @xmath89    observe moreover that the vertical subspaces @xmath88 are the vectors tangent to the fibres .",
    "therefore , any vertical vector @xmath90 can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 ( i.e , @xmath11 is an antihermitian matrix ) .",
    "note that our metric @xmath82 defines a natural connexion as follows : a tangent vector @xmath93 at @xmath54 is horizontal if it is orthogonal to the fibre passing through @xmath54 , i.e. , if @xmath94 for all vertical vector @xmath95 at @xmath54 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "hence @xmath97 is horizontal if @xmath98    therefore , we can define a metric @xmath99 in the base manifold for any point @xmath100 , given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( respectively @xmath104 ) are the horizontal lift of @xmath95 ( respectively @xmath105 ) .",
    "the metric @xmath99 in the base manifold at any point @xmath100 can be obtained as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the unique hermitian matrix satisfying @xmath108    note that matrix @xmath107 exists and is unique by the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the sylvester equation@xcite .",
    "observe moreover that when @xmath72 is the identity matrix , then @xmath109 where @xmath107 is the ( unique ) solution of @xmath110 and that is the bures metric @xcite .",
    "let @xmath111 be a curve , such that @xmath112 is an horizontal vector , then @xmath113    let us define @xmath114 , thus @xmath115    it is easy to see that the latter condition is fulfilled if @xmath116 where @xmath41 is an hermitian matrix .",
    "therefore @xmath117    hence applying equation [ 2_2 ] @xmath118    suppose that @xmath119 then @xmath120 where @xmath121    applying equation ( [ 3_5 ] ) in @xmath122 @xmath123    using the above expression ( [ 3_6 ] ) the theorem follows .    in the case of pure states ,",
    "our hilbert space is @xmath124 and the tangent space will be @xmath124 too . following kryukov work@xcite , we can define a metric @xmath125 for any two tangent vectors @xmath126 , @xmath127 , by @xmath128 where @xmath129 , therefore @xmath130    when @xmath72 is the identity , we recover the fubini - study metric .      as we have previously seen in the shg - quantum fibre bundle @xmath86 of dimension @xmath21",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence , the projection of the integral curves of the vector field @xmath77 satisfies the von neumann equation .",
    "so all we have to prove is that curves are actually geodesic curves @xmath143    since @xmath77 is a killing vector field , we only have to proof that @xmath77 is a unitary vector field ( due any unitary killing vector field is a geodesic ) .",
    "namely , the equality @xmath144    finally , since @xmath5 is a unitary killing vector field and the integral curves of any killing vector field of constant length is a geodesic ( see appendix theorem [ unitary - geodesic ] ) , the integral curves of @xmath5 are geodesics .",
    "let us emphasize that for any hermitian matrix @xmath145 , we can build the vector field @xmath146 on @xmath56 given by @xmath147 for any @xmath69 .",
    "it is easy to check as done in equation [ isometry ] that if @xmath148=0 $ ] , @xmath146 is a killing vector field .",
    "therefore , the set of operators compatible with the hamiltonian are related to the set of isometries of @xmath85 , and we can identify any conserved quantum observable with a killing vector field .",
    "as we know from the main theorem , @xmath77 is a killing vector field on the principal manifold @xmath85 endowed with the dynamic metric @xmath82 . then , the transformations given by the @xmath149parametric subgroup @xmath150 of integral curves of @xmath77 are distance - preserving and volume - preserving ( see appendix theorem [ killing - isometry ] ) .",
    "these two facts have the following consequences    let @xmath151 be a shg - quantum principal bundle of dimension @xmath21 . then , for any two points @xmath152 @xmath153 being the @xmath154 the @xmath149parametric subgroup of transformations given by the integral curves of the killing field @xmath77 .",
    "the classical liouville theorem@xcite states that the natural volume form on a symplectic manifold is invariant under the hamiltonian flows . in our case , we have the @xmath149parametric subgroup of transformations @xmath155 given by the integral curves of the killing vector field @xmath77 and we can set    let @xmath156 be a shg - quantum principal bundle of dimension @xmath21 . then for any domain @xmath157 @xmath158 being the @xmath154 the @xmath149parametric subgroup of transformations given by the integral curves of the killing vector field @xmath77 .    using the above theorem , we can therefore state a similar theorem to the poincare recurrence theorem@xcite .",
