    "v838 monocerotis ( henceforth v@xmath7 mon ) is a dramatic stellar object : in 2002 , it brightened nine magnitudes during three outbursts @xcite , experienced a variety of distinctive optical and infrared ( ir ) changes @xcite , and eventually morphed into a l - type supergiant @xcite .",
    "v838 mon is estimated to be located at a distance of 6.2@xmath51.2kpc @xcite and is embedded in a sparse , young cluster with an upper age limit of @xmath825 myr and an intervening reddening e(b - v)=0.85 @xcite . since its outburst , an unresolved b3v companion in the system has been detected through spectroscopic monitoring @xcite .",
    "many theoretical mechanisms have been explored to explain the origin of v@xmath7 mon s outbursts @xcite ; the most likely scenario is a stellar merger between two progenitor stars in a formerly triple system @xcite .",
    "this scenerio also predicts x - ray emission from the spin - up of the envelope produced by such a merger @xcite ; however , such x - ray emission has not been seen in two epochs of chandra imagery @xcite .",
    "the light from v@xmath7 mon s b3v companion is sufficient to account for the entire luminosity of the variable star measured on sky - survey photographs before its outburst @xcite ( however , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the progenitor as its own b3v star ) .",
    "while v@xmath7 mon is a decidedly rare object , several analogs have been reported in the literature .",
    "two emerging classes of cool explosions are : luminous red novae ( lrne ) and intermediate luminosity red transients ( ilrts ) .",
    "akin to v@xmath7 mon , lrne are stellar eruptions that have remained extremely cool through the outburst and include v1309 sco @xcite and v4332 sgr @xcite .",
    "two extragalactic events have also been noted to be lrne : one in the bulge of m31 @xcite and one in the lenticular galaxy m85 @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that lrne are stellar mergers .",
    "ilrts are similarly red but too luminous to be explained by stellar mergers : _ e.g. _ , sn2008s in ngc 6946 @xcite , ngc300-ot2008 @xcite , and ptf10fqs in m99 @xcite .",
    "consistent with their discovery in grand spirals , it has been proposed that ilrts represent electron - capture induced collapse in extreme asymptotic giant brach stars @xcite .",
    "the local circumstellar environment of v@xmath7 mon has been studied extensively since the initial outburst of the system . based on an observed , short - lived ( february  march , 2002 ) intrinsic polarization in the system , the outburst geometry was likely non - spherical @xcite . in october 2002 ,",
    "a temporary re - emergence of an intrinsic polarization component occurred .",
    "oriented 90@xmath9 from the original component , the new polarization suggests one of two changes to the system : either a change in the optical depth of the material surrounding the star(s ) or a physical shift in the illuminating source(s ) @xcite .",
    "recent interferometric observations @xcite have indicated a similar local circumstellar geometry as suggested by polarimetric data .",
    "v838 mon is also surrounded by a substantially broader region of nebular material as diagnosed by the dramatic light echo illuminated by the outburst events @xcite",
    ".    continued observations of v838 mon s local circumstellar environment have traced the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "optical and ir photometric monitoring has suggested that the outburst ejecta has advanced past the location of the b3v binary , completely attenuating its signal @xcite and condensing to form new circumstellar dust @xcite . to explain the evolution of spectroscopic and photometric properties observed over time , @xcite proposed a simple , spherically symmetric model containing a central star with an expanding circumstellar shell that is cooling in a radiatively - dominated quasi - equilibrium manner ; this model is consistent with spectral fits to optical and ir data from @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite expanded this conceptual framework to include five components : a central star , two photospheric shells that surround the central star , and two much cooler and more distant expanding shells of gas . validating the central tenents of these models , including the number of components required and their expansion velocities , has remained elusive due to the previously limited number of epochs ( 2 ) of ir data available .    in this paper , we discuss the continued evolution of the system in the context of the lynch et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2007 ) models and previously published photometric , spectroscopic , and spectro - polarimetric observations of the system . in  [ sec : observ ] , we present optical , near - ir , and mid - ir spectroscopic and mid - ir photometric observations of v@xmath7 mon obtained between 2008 and 2012 at the apache point observatory 3.5 m , nasa irtf 3 m , and gemini south 8 m telescopes . in ",
    "[ sec : halpha ] , we show a low level of h@xmath3 emission has returned to the system , possibly due to excitation of the gas by the b3v companion as seen through the optically thinning gas and dust ejecta or due to magnetic activity produced by an emerging dynamo effect from the proposed stellar merger . in  [ sec : spectyp ] , we spectrally type v@xmath7 mon in both the optical ( m7 supergiant ) and near infrared ( l3 supergiant ) and discuss the discrepancy in the two identifications . in  [ sec : irseds ] , we fit our 2009 observations to the @xcite model for the expanding warm dust envelope and find our data is consistent with the previous two epochs of data .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : results ] , we discuss the implications of the results we presented in the previous sections .",
    "optical spectra were taken using the astrophysical research consortium echelle spectrograph ( arces ) and the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) instruments on apache point observatory s ( apo ) @xmath0 m telescope between 2008 - 2012 ( see table [ tab : observation_table ] ) .",
    "arces @xcite is a high resolution , cross - dispersed visible light spectrograph that obtains spectra between 3600 - 10000 @xmath10 with a resolution of r@xmath831500 .",
    "standard bias , flat field , and thar lamp exposures for the echelle were also obtained on every night .",
    "these data were reduced using standard techniques in iraf .",
    "dis is a medium dispersion spectrograph with separate red and blue channels .",
    "our dis observations were taken using the default low - resolution blue and red gratings ( b400/r300 ) , yielding a resolution r@xmath8800 and a total effective wavelength coverage of @xmath11 .",
    "bias , flat field , and henear lamp exposures for dis were obtained on every night , and nightly observations of the flux standard stars g191b2b , feige34 or feige110 were used to flux calibrate these data .",
    "these data were reduced using standard techniques in iraf .",
    "we obtained two epochs of observations of v838 mon ( table [ tab : observation_table ] ) using spex @xcite , a medium - resolution @xmath12-@xmath13 @xmath14 m spectrograph located at nasa s infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "we used the 0@xmath153 x 15@xmath150 slit for our v838 mon observations , providing r@xmath82000 spectra from 0.8 - 2.5 @xmath14 m , and also obtained observations of the a0v star hd 53205 to provide telluric correction .",
    "these data were reduced using spextool @xcite .",
    "mid - ir low resolution spectroscopy and imaging of v838 mon were obtained with t - recs ( thermal - region camera spectrograph ) , located at the gemini south observatory ( gso ) .",
    "as summarized in table [ tab : observation_table ] , we obtained both low resolution ( r@xmath8100 ) spectroscopy in the n - band , narrow - band photometry near the n - band ( si-5 : 11.7 @xmath14 m and si-6 : 12.3 @xmath14 m ) , and broad - band photomtry in the q - band ( qa : 18.3 @xmath14 m ) . standard telescope chopping and nodding was used to mitigate the effects of the thermal background of the sky in the mid ir .",
    "these data were reduced using the _ midir _ gemini / iraf software package .",
    "we also present two epochs of mid - ir photometry of v838 mon obtained with the broadband array spectrograph system ( bass ) , mounted on nasa s irtf ( see table [ tab : observation_table ] ) .",
    "bass is an infrared array prism spectrograph @xcite that covers the @xmath16-@xmath17 @xmath14 m spectral region simultaneously at a resolving power of 25 - 120 , depending on wavelength , and records these data on 116 back - illuminated blocked impurity band si : as detectors .",
    "our bass observations were calibrated using @xmath3 tau as a reference star .",
    "we note that relative calibrations for reference stars @xmath3 tau , @xmath3 cma , @xmath18 gem , @xmath3 boo , and @xmath3 lyr have remained constant to about 1% with repeated tests .",
    "the h@xmath3 line has proven to be an important diagnostic of the evolution of v838 mon s circumstellar environment , helping to trace the initial expansion of ejecta from the 2002 outbursts @xcite and in 2006 probing the likely interaction of this expanding ejecta with the b3v companion @xcite .",
    "we discuss the continued monitoring of h@xmath3 between october 2008 and september 2012 below .    in figure",
    "[ f : dis_halpha ] , we present three optical spectra of v@xmath7 mon taken with the low resolution ( r @xmath19 ) dis spectrograph on apo . we detect no convincing evidence of h@xmath3 emission at this resolution , which is consistent with conclusions drawn by @xcite .",
    "however , the three optical spectra of v@xmath7 mon taken with the high resolution ( r @xmath20 ) echelle spectrograph on apo during the same epoch as our low resolution spectra clearly reveal the presence of a low level of h@xmath3 emission ( figure  [ f : echelle_halpha ] ) .",
    "this low level of emission still appears present during our fourth epoch of high resolution spectra obtained in 2012 .",
    "we do not observe any significant variability in the h@xmath3 emission .",
    "these results are consistent with the report of low level h@xmath3 emission being present in 2009-epoch high resolution spectra by @xcite , and extend the time period over which the system exhibits this emission .    one possible origin for this low level emission could be excitation of the expanding dust and gas envelope by the b3v companion .",
    "@xcite suggests that the behavior of h@xmath3 from 200 to 2009 , which included a brief return of the line appearing in emission followed by a return to an apparent pure absorption profile , was due to the b3v companion becoming completely engulfed by the expanding envelope .",
    "however , our high resolution spectra suggest that perhaps this envelope is not completely optically thick .",
    "alternatively , the observed low level h@xmath3 emission could be caused by magnetic activity in the primary star , which is an expected byproduct of the proposed stellar merger event of 2002 @xcite .",
    "we discuss the plausibility of each of these scenarios in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "to better understand the properties of the central star , we compare both the dis optical spectrum and spex ir spectrum with other cool objects . for the purposes of this discussion ,",
    "we assume that the dust shell has little or no effect on the spectral features , and have corrected for a reddening of @xmath21 .      for a starting point in our analysis",
    ", we compare the optical spectrum of v@xmath7 mon to m5m9 dwarf @xcite and giant @xcite spectroscopic templates ( shown in figure  [ f : optical_comp ] ) .",
    "we used the hammer spectral typing software @xcite to estimate the optical spectral type based on the characteristics of m dwarf optical spectra .",
    "we obtain a best fit type of m7 , consistent with the @xcite type of m6.3 .",
    "an examination of the specific optical features , however , indicates that the type is primarily based on the strength of the tio bands , and most optical features are more sensitive to the v@xmath7 mon s surface gravity rather than its surface temperature .",
    "the optical spectrum of v@xmath7 mon shows strong , sharp tio and vo features , with only weak cah absorption at 6750  and no sign of feh absorption at 8600 .",
    "the presence and strength of tio and vo is consistent with an oxygen - rich stellar atmosphere , and the absence of feh and cah bands indicate a very low gravity atmosphere ; those bands are weak or absent in m giants @xcite .",
    "the sharpness of the tio and vo bands and the doublet at 7700  compared to both the dwarf and giant templates indicates that it is likely to have an even lower surface gravity ( consistent with a supergiant classification ) .",
    "the tio bands at 6150 , 6651 , and 7053  each absorb to zero flux , indicating the absence of the b3 component detected by @xcite .",
    "there is no detection of the 8183/8195   doublet , which is typically in absorption for late - m dwarfs and in emission for late - m giants @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the lack of emission is due to the lower gravity of v@xmath7 mon compared to m giants .",
    "the absence of this feature is perhaps not remarkable due to the weak or absent absorption both in the optical ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the @xmath85893  doublet is very weak in the 2009 spectrum ) and the near - infrared ( we do not detect the doublets at @xmath81.14 and @xmath82.21@xmath14 m ; see section  [ sec : irtype ] ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the 0.82.4@xmath14 m spectrum of v@xmath7 mon appeared to be that of an l supergiant star .",
    "there are no other objects with an l supergiant classification , so we select a range of spectra for comparison to the spex observations of v@xmath7 mon , drawing both from late - m and l dwarf spectra and late - m giant and supergiant spectra . in figure  [ f : ir_comp ] , we show the spex spectrum of v@xmath7 mon compared to publicly available infrared spectra @xcite of m8v lp 412 - 31 ( similar to its initial optical classification ) , m8/9iii iras 14303 - 1042 ( as an example late - m giant ) , and m7i my cep ( as an example of a late - m supergaint ) , and l3v 2mass j00361617 + 1821104 ( possibly similar in surface temperature ) from the irtf spectral library .",
    "each of these spectra share some spectral features with v@xmath7 mon .",
    "the best match for the overall shape of the v@xmath7 mon spectrum is a mid - l dwarf , so we apply l dwarf classification indices to the infrared spectrum of v@xmath7 mon .",
    "l dwarfs are classified not only on their spectral type / t@xmath22 , but also their surface gravity ( which shows a dependency on age ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the strength of its h@xmath23o bands , which primarily trace effective temperature , v@xmath7 mon has an infrared spectral type of l3 .",
    "the @xcite gravity indices ( based on the strength of , vo , and feh ) indicate a very low gravity .",
    "the and feh are in fact completely absent from the spectrum , consistent with the very low surface gravity l supergiant classification @xcite .    despite the l3 classification , the detailed spectral features of v@xmath7 mon are not a close match to those of l3 dwarfs , as can be seen in figure  [ f : ir_comp ]",
    ". the tio bands between 0.8 and 0.9 microns , discussed in [ sec : opttype ] , are not typically present in l dwarf spectra .",
    "the very low surface gravity of v@xmath7 mon results in the absence of feh , and between 1.1 and 1.3@xmath14 m .",
    "another dramatic difference between l dwarfs an v@xmath7 mon is the presence of alo a - x absorption bands ( first identified on v@xmath7 mon by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 1.226 , 1.242 , 1.646 , and 1.648@xmath14 m .",
    "these bands are consistent with oxygen - rich , low temperature environments and have been observed in a handful of agb stars @xcite .",
    "the best match for the detailed @xmath24-band spectrum of v@xmath7 mon is that of the m8/9ii iras 14303 - 1042 ; both have tio , vo , and h@xmath23o absorption features , though the specific shapes and strengths of the features are not well matched .",
    "the @xmath25-band spectrum of v@xmath7 mon is dominated by h@xmath23o , co , and",
    "oh , resulting in detailed features very similar to those of the m7i my cep ( excepting the alo absorption bands , present only in v@xmath7 mon ) .",
    "the @xmath26-band spectra of all three comparison stars are a good overall match to v@xmath7 mon , but the co bands appear different in both shape and strength , possibly due to the complexities of the dust shell surrounding v@xmath7 mon .",
    "the co bands in our 2008 spectrum are qualitatively similar to those detected in the @xcite low - resolution 2006 infrared spectra .",
    "@xcite analyzes the co bands in detail using a high resolution ( r@xmath818000 ) spectra taken within a few months of the low resolution detection ; this high - resolution spectra revealed distinct velocity components within the co spectrum .",
    "the main component of the co was at photospheric temperatures , but with a radial velocity of @xmath27  km  s@xmath28 relative to the stellar radial velocity , indicating the gas was still settling on the surface of the star .",
    "other components of the co absorption were associated with the more extended dust shell . in our 2008 spectrum , v@xmath7 mon",
    "s co bands are stronger than those of all the comparison objects , which may indicate that some of the extended dust shell components still contribute to the absorption , but we do not have the velocity resolution to investigate the co bands in more detail .",
    "v@xmath7 mon is relatively free of molecular absorption near 1.3 and 2.2@xmath14 m , revealing weak absorption lines .",
    "these lines appear qualitatively similar to those of the m7i my cep and are likely a feature of supergiant atmospheres . using the list of infrared lines in arcturus @xcite ,",
    "we tentatively identify a @xmath29 1.2903 , 1.2980@xmath14 m doublet ; an @xmath291.3127 , 1.3153@xmath14 m doublet ; and a @xmath291.3181@xmath14 m absorption line in the 1.251.32@xmath14 m spectral region .",
    "near @xmath82.2@xmath14 m , we tentatively identify at 2.2069@xmath14 m ( not the doublet seen in the dwarf spectra ) ; a @xmath292.2217 , 2.2239 , 2.2280@xmath14 m triplet ; and a @xmath292.2614 , 2.2631 , 2.2633 , 2.2657@xmath14 m quadruplet .",
    "both regions have additional lines of similar strength that overlapped with multiple atomic transitions so could not be positively identified at this resolution .",
    "the optical and infrared spectra of v@xmath7 mon , at first glance , seem to indicate different spectral types , and therefore different surface temperatures ( t@xmath22 ) . adopting the m7 optical spectral type and extrapolating the supergiant spectral type / t@xmath22 relation of @xcite",
    "gives a surface temperature of t@xmath30  k ( similar to the temperature quoted by * ? ? ?",
    "there is no supergiant temperature scale for l dwarfs , but an l3 dwarf spectral type corresponds to t@xmath31  k @xcite .",
    "one possible way of reconciling those two temperatures is an application of a multi - layer photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but here we estimate based on the comparison of v@xmath7 mon to other stars .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : opttype ] , the optical spectrum for v@xmath7 mon matches an m7 dwarf best because the tio bands are strongest on m7 photospheres .",
    "the fraction of tio contained in molecules ( vs.   ) increases with decreasing temperature , hitting a maximum ( at m dwarf atmospheric pressures ) at t@xmath1  k @xcite . at temperatures cooler than t@xmath32  k , tio begins to condense onto dust grains ( e.g. , perovskite ) @xcite , so tio disappears in m7 and later dwarfs .",
    "the formation of dust grains is more sensitive to atmospheric pressure than the formation of tio , so at low surface gravity , a low temperature atmosphere will continue to have strong tio bands at t@xmath32  k.    the remaining indicators of cool temperatures in optical spectra ( e.g. , the transition from late - m to l dwarfs ) are pressure sensitive ; gravity broadening of the doublet , the strengthening of feh .",
    "additionally , the infrared spectrum of v@xmath7 mon appears cooler than the m7i my cep due to stronger tio , vo , and h@xmath23o bands .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of v@xmath7 mon may be both very cooler and very low gravity ; a prototype for l supergiants in the optical .",
    "m giants are t@xmath33@xmath34  k warmer than dwarfs of the same optical type , and if this trend continues , the surface temperature of v@xmath7 mon is likely to be t@xmath1@xmath2  k. this range of temperatures is also consistent with the formation of strong tio bands without significant depletion of tio onto dust .",
    "in this section , we fit our visible and infrared data with a two component blackbody curve .",
    "we consider the physical interpretation of this fit in context of the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth , l04 ) model of v@xmath7 mon s post outburst evolution .",
    "our goal is to constrain the evolution of the ejecta with our new epoch of data .",
    "the l04 model contains three components .    1",
    ".   the central star s photospheric emission , which is modeled as an inner blackbody source with a homogeneous outer , cooler absorbing layer .",
    "the central star is described by a radius , @xmath35 , and a blackbody temperature , @xmath36 .",
    "2 .   a warm shell , which is modeled with several parameters , including an expanding radius , @xmath37 , and a vibrational / blackbody emission temperature , @xmath38 .",
    "3 .   a cold , outer shell , modeled in a similar fashion as the warm , expanding shell , but with an emission temperature set to zero . here , the quantity of greatest significance is the absorber column ( resulting in an effective emissivity , @xmath39 , of the system ) .",
    "we also considered the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth , l07 ) model of v@xmath7 mon s ejecta , which contains 5 components ( a central star , two photospheric shells that surround the central star , and two much cooler and more distant expanding shells of gas ) .",
    "this model is essentially the same as the l04 model , except the two photospheric layers are considered separately from the central star , and are each assumed to be homogeneous and characterized by a single equilibrium temperature and column amounts for the molecular species .",
    "while the added components are physically reasonable and lead to refined predictions for @xmath36 , the added complexity beyond this revision did not help us build additional insight from our two component blackbody fit .",
    "therefore , our remaining discussion will focus primarily on comparisons with the l04 model .",
    "best fits from l04 and l07 can be found in table  [ table : model ] .",
    "we note that the generally accepted values for the velocity of the expanding cloud in 2003 were within 100 - 400 km s@xmath28 ( see l04 and references therein ) .",
    "we assume the velocity of the expanding cloud is @xmath40 km s@xmath28 and the distance to v@xmath7 mon is @xmath41 kpc @xcite to generate model predictions . in january 2009 , l04 predicts : @xmath42 au ( no evolution from 2005 ) ; @xmath43 k ( no evolution from 2005 ) ; @xmath44 au ( time elapse 6 year 10.5 months , expansion rate 33.75 au / yr ) ; and @xmath45 k ( temperature of cloud in 2003 @xmath46 0.38 ) .",

    "significantly , the temperatures at which tio can remain coherent in supergiant photospheres could be as high as 20002200 k. given the complete lack of l supergiant data to type against within the optical regime , we conclude that v@xmath7 mon could plausibly be catagorized as a l supergiant in both the ir and optical regimes . in this regard , we speculate that v@xmath7 mon could be a prototype for what an l supergiant optical spectra should look like .    in  [ sec :",

    "@xcite found highly variable x - ray emission associated with v@xmath7 mon : in 2008 , strong x - ray emission was detected with xmm newton , but in 2009 and 2010 no such emission was found using chandra . from this , @xcite suggest that the magnetic activity itself might be highly variable .",
    "we do not detect significant h@xmath3 variability in our high resolution spectra that supports the purported variable magnetic activity ; however , we can not rule out that this is due to the sparse , non - contemporaneous sampling of the optical and x - ray data .",
    "alternatively , the emission may simply be caused by the continued excitation of hi in the expanding shell of gas and dust by the b3v binary companion , which would indicate that this shell is not completely optically thick .    to ultimately disentangle which scenario is generating the h@xmath3 emission , a simultaneous x - ray and observational campaign is needed . as @xcite note , it is implausible to generate high x - ray luminosities from the simple interactions of infalling matter with the matter above the stellar photosphere unless extreme accretion rates and infall velocities are involved . thus catching v@xmath7 mon in the act of producing strong x - ray emission",
    "would be a strong indicator that the stellar merger is the ultimate source of any ongoing h@xmath3 activity .",
    "even if no x - ray emission is detected , it is certainly worthwhile to continue to monitor the h@xmath3 activity and search for the reappearance of the b3v companion",
    ". further evolution ( or lack thereof ) will put strong contraints on both the material surrounding v@xmath7 mon and the genesis event that fueled the outbursts .",
