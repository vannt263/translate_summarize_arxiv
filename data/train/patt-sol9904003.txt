    "for a variety of systems the interplay between nonlinearity and disorder results in novel and fascinating phenomena @xcite . particularly , the study of soliton dynamics in inhomogeneous and disordered media has received a great deal of attention in recent years @xcite since it concerns real condensed matter systems and phenomena .",
    "it is well known that transport properties in inhomogeneous and disordered media can change dramatically when the nonlinearity allows the creation of solitons . as a first step in the study of soliton dynamics in disordered media",
    "many authors explored the interaction between a soliton and an isolated impurity .",
    "this soliton - impurity interaction has been modeled by a point - like impurity and a structureless soliton . in real situations we can have several inhomogeneities of different kinds .",
    "when the distance between impurities is considerable higher than the width of solitons and impurities the traditional approach gives a correct result .",
    "when this is not so , we witness a series of surprising phenomena .",
    "the dimensionless klein - gordon - like equations model a wide variety of soliton bearing systems@xcite , including charge density waves , josephson junctions , structural phase transitions , crystal growth , polymers , proton conductivity , macromolecules and hydrogen - bond chains : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is a potential that possesses at least two minima@xcite , meanwhile @xmath3 represent additional forces ( external forcing , dissipation , presence of impurities , inhomogeneous external fields , coupling to other degrees of freedom ) .    the soliton solution of eq .",
    "( [ equ_1 ] ) is usually treated as a structureless point - like particle .",
    "a richer dynamics is unveiled when the extended character of the soliton is taken into account .",
    "for instance , in a previous work @xcite , gonzlez and hoyst studied the @xmath4 equation ( @xmath5 ) : @xmath6 particularly , they showed that the zeroes of @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 ) play the roll of equilibrium positions for the soliton . in the case that only one zero , @xmath9 exists , the condition for stability for the kink / antikink is : @xmath10 _ { x = x_0}\\left\\ {   \\begin{array}{ll } > 0 & \\mbox{for the kink . } \\\\   < 0 & \\mbox{for the antikink . }",

    "\\label{con:1}\\ ] ] for the stable case , the inhomogeneity can trap the soliton , but in the case that @xmath7 possesses more than one zero , the stability condition may become too complex . here",
    "the extended character of the soliton arises , and interesting phenomena appear such as the interaction between the structure of the soliton ( which is not a point - like particle ) and the inhomogeneities , and between the shape modes of the soliton themselves .",
    "the external force @xmath11 can change the spectrum of small oscillations about the soliton and additional bounded states can exist .    for the soliton of the @xmath4 equation without perturbation",
    ", there are only two bounded states ( besides the continuous spectrum ) : the translational mode and the shape mode . for specific values of the parameters that define the force @xmath7 used in ref .",
    "@xcite , not only an increase of the number of shape modes can exist , but in certain cases these can be unstable .",
    "moreover the continuous spectrum can lose stability and the soliton becomes unstable against interaction with phonons .",
    "the above mentioned authors also considered the problem with the time dependent force @xmath12 and found that if @xmath12 has a spatial shape such that it coincides with one of the eigenfunctions of the stability operator of the soliton , then it is possible to get resonance if the frequency of the force also coincides with the resonant frequency of the considered mode .",
    "this means , for example , that energy can be given to the translational mode ( or any of the shape modes ) using a @xmath12 coupled to the translational mode ( or any of the shape modes ) .    when @xmath7 has three zeroes , this is equivalent to a double well potential ( like the one found in the duffing equation@xcite ) chaotic motion of the soliton is possible applying an additional periodic force @xmath12 for a determined set of values of the parameters .    in this paper",
    "we take into account the extended character of both the soliton and the impurity .",
    "we show that these considerations lead to the existence of a finite number of soliton internal modes that underlies a rich spatiotemporal dynamics .",
    "we introduce impurities of the @xmath13 type , where @xmath14 is a function with a bell shape .",
    "an impurity of this kind but using delta functions has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our paper",
    "we consider a finite width impurity and a finite width kink and show the striking differences between this approach and the traditional one ( structureless solitons and delta - function - like impurities ) .",
    "we present a model for which the exact stationary soliton solution in the presence of inhomogeneities can be obtained and the stability problem can be solved exactly . to achieve this purpose",
    "we solve an inverse problem in order to have external perturbations which are generic and topologically equivalent to well - known bifurcation model systems@xcite .",
    "we choose the `` exact '' solution such that the differential operator that appears in the stability problem is a posch - teller potential that can be solved exactly .",
    "besides , the `` generated '' external force and the impurities have important physical properties .",
    "in particular , the inhomogeneous force @xmath11 is equivalent to the pitchfork bifurcation canonical form@xcite and the @xmath13 impurity is topologically equivalent to the @xmath15 type impurity that is very frequently used .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate the sensibility of the soliton internal dynamics to the inhomogeneity width even for the isolated impurity case .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present a description of our model and we give specific physical interpretations of the equations under consideration . in sec .",
    "iii we study the equilibrium positions of the soliton and its stability .",
    "we analyze the interaction of the soliton with the inhomogeneity created by the interplay between a finite - width and @xmath16-dependent impurity and the already studied inhomogeneities independent of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we also consider the action of time dependent forces fitted to the shape of the translational mode of the soliton . in sec .",

    "vi we summarize and discuss our results and also present some concluding remarks . in the appendices we outline the numerical method and present the karhunen - love decomposition .",
    "the topological solitons studied in the present paper possess important applications in condensed matter physics . for instance , in solid state physics , they describe domain walls in ferromagnets or ferroelectric materials , dislocations in crystals , charge - density waves , interphase boundaries in metal alloys , fluxons in long josephson junctions and josephson transmission lines , etc.@xcite    although some of the above mentioned systems are described by the @xmath4-model and others by the sine - gordon equation ( and these equations , in their unperturbed versions , present differences like the fact that the sine - gordon equation is completely integrable whereas the @xmath4-model is not ) the properties of the solitons supported by sine - gordon and @xmath4 equations are very similar .",
    "in fact , these equations are _ topologically equivalent _ and very often the result obtained for one of them can be applied to the other@xcite .    here",
    "we consider the @xmath4 equation in the presence of inhomogeneities and damping :    @xmath18    where @xmath7 is a function with ( at least ) one zero and @xmath14 is a bell - shaped function that rapidly decays to zero for @xmath19 .    in ferroelectric materials",

    "it is possible to apply nonuniformly distributed current sources ( @xmath7 ) and to create inhomogeneities of type @xmath14 using different electronic circuits in some specific elements of the chain@xcite .    in the present paper the functions @xmath7 and @xmath14",
    "will be defined as ,    @xmath21    @xmath22    the case @xmath23 has been studied in many papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) . here",

    "microshorts , microresistors and/or impurities in atomic chains@xcite are usually described by dirac s delta functions ( @xmath25 ) where the width of the impurity is neglected .",
    "the function @xmath14 is topologically equivalent to a @xmath26 but it allows us to consider the influence of the width of the impurity .",
    "let us consider the eq .",
    "( [ a:1 ] ) and assume the existence of a static kink solution @xmath27 that corresponds to a soliton placed in a stable equilibrium state created by the inhomogeneities @xmath7 and @xmath14 .    analyzing the small amplitude oscillations around the kink solution @xmath28 ,    @xmath29    we get , for the function @xmath30 , the following equation :    @xmath31    studying of the stability of the equilibrium solution @xmath27 leads to the following eigenvalue problem ( we have introduced @xmath32 into eq .",
    "( [ a:3 ] ) ) :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 .",
    "let us now study some particular cases : if @xmath35 , and the function @xmath36 is described by the expression ( [ a:11 ] ) , then it can be shown that the exact solution for the kink in equilibrium at the position @xmath24 is ,    @xmath37    and that the discrete eigenvalue spectrum is described by the following formula ,    @xmath38    where the parameter @xmath39 is defined as ,    @xmath40    the integer part of @xmath39 ( @xmath41 $ ] ) defines the number of modes of the discrete spectrum .    from eq .",
    "( [ a:7 ] ) the stability condition for the translational mode ( @xmath42 ) can be obtained :    @xmath43    it is worth noticing that if the coefficient of @xmath14 is negative , the equilibrium position created by the impurity of the @xmath13 type is stable for the soliton , and that the stability condition is independent of the polarity of the soliton .",
    "the opposite occurs when a inhomogeneity like @xmath11 is considered .",
    "furthermore , it is necessary to point out the differences between the case in which the soliton equilibrium position is due to a zero of @xmath7 , and the case in which the kink is trapped in the effective well created by the impurity @xmath44 . in the former the characteristic width and the number of internal modes that can be excited are smaller than those for the free kink , and even smaller than those for the kink in equilibrium in an unstable position . while , in the latter the characteristic width and the number of internal modes that can be excited are greater than those for the free kink and for the kink in unstable equilibrium in a repulsive impurity .",
    "this is due to the inverse proportionality between the width of the impurity and @xmath45 ( just like the width of the kink ) .",
    "the impurity is more stable as @xmath45 diminishes .",
    "finally , let us consider the case in which both types of inhomogeneities ( @xmath11 and @xmath13 ) are present in eq .",
    "( [ a:1 ] ) .",
    "these functions are defined as in equations ( [ a:10 ] ) and ( [ a:11 ] ) .    for these functions",
    "the exact solution describing the static soliton can be written :    @xmath46    the spectral problem ( eq .",
    "( [ a:4 ] ) ) brings the following eigenvalues for the discrete spectrum :    @xmath47    here @xmath39 is defined as ,    @xmath48    the stability condition for the translational mode is ,    @xmath49    when this condition is not fulfilled ( the equilibrium position @xmath24 is unstable ) and @xmath50 , then there will exist three equilibrium points for the soliton : two stable ( at points @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) and one unstable at point @xmath24 .",
    "this happens because for large values of @xmath53 the leading inhomogeneity is @xmath7 , which is non - local and not zero at infinity .",
    "this inhomogeneity acts as a restoring force that pushes the soliton towards the point @xmath24 . as a result of the competition between the local instability induced by @xmath44 at @xmath24 and the non - local inhomogeneity @xmath7 ,",
    "an effective double - well potential is created .",
    "this is equivalent to a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "also note that when @xmath54 then @xmath55 , i.e. , there is an unstable mode created by the impurity @xmath13 even for a flat initial condition .",
    "this contrasts with the @xmath56 result expected for a delta - like impurity and with the result of gonzlez and hoyst@xcite for the other kind of inhomogeneity ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for eq .",
    "( [ equ_1 ] ) perturbed with inhomogeneous external forces , impurities and time - periodic forces .",
    "first , we show , for inhomogeneities of the @xmath7 type , the bifurcations leading to the chaotic regime . later , we study quasiperiodic regimes as the soliton internal modes are excited by an impurity of the type @xmath13 . finally , we present bifurcations as the internal modes are excited for the case in which the two types of inhomogeneities ( @xmath7 and @xmath13 ) are present .",
    "we simulate the following equation ,    @xmath57    where static and time - dependent forces are inhomogeneous and given by the following expressions :    @xmath58    and @xmath59    the force @xmath7 , firstly introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be obtained as a result of an inverse problem for which an effective potential equivalent to the canonical form of the pitchfork bifurcation is desired . for @xmath50 and @xmath60 , we are in presence of a double - well potential _ for the soliton _ , ( i.e. , the model is a duffing - like@xcite soliton oscillator ) .",

    "the period doubling cascade for low values of the control parameter corresponds to oscillations of the soliton in one well . at @xmath69",

    "the radiation problem also has been addressed using other perturbative methods@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have focused our attention on the stability of the translational mode .",
    "note that when the soliton is in an equilibrium position created by the impurities that is stable for the translational mode , the soliton as a whole is stable against the emission or absortion of radiation ( these modes are usually called phonon modes ) .",

    "<S> we present an analytical and numerical study of the klein - gordon kink - soliton dynamics in inhomogeneous media . in particular , we study an external field that is almost constant for the whole system but that changes its sign at the center of coordinates and a localized impurity with finite - width . the soliton solution of the klein - gordon - like equations is usually treated as a structureless point - like particle . </S>",
    "<S> a richer dynamics is unveiled when the extended character of the soliton is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we show that interesting spatiotemporal phenomena appear when the structure of the soliton interacts with finite - width inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> we solve an inverse problem in order to have external perturbations which are generic and topologically equivalent to well - known bifurcation models and such that the stability problem can be solved exactly . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the different quasiperiodic and chaotic motions the soliton undergoes as a time - dependent force pumps energy into the traslational mode of the kink and relate these dynamics with the excitation of the shape modes of the soliton .    # </S>"
