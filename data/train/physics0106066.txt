    "spear  3 is the 3  gev upgrade project under study at ssrl  @xcite .",
    "it aims at replacing the current 130  nm@xmath0rad fodo lattice with an 18  nm@xmath0rad low emittance double bend achromat ( dba ) lattice . to minimize the cost of the project and to use the existing synchrotron light beam lines , the new design  @xcite closely follows the racetrack configuration of the spear tunnel , with the magnet positions fit to the 18  magnet girders shown in fig .",
    "[ y : f : girders ] . as in the current design , the spear  3 lattice has two - fold symmetry and periodicity with two identical arcs and two long straight sections .",
    "each arc in the new lattice has 7  identical symmetric cells , and each straight section consists of two mirror symmetric matching cells .",
    "the lattice functions of one quarter of the ring are shown in fig .",
    "[ y : f : qring ] . the two bends and a quadrupole in the middle of each dba cell",
    "compensate the dispersion , while the two quadrupole doublets at each end control the tune and cell @xmath1 functions .",
    "since the new lattice cells have to fit to the existing 11.7  m cell length , it results in a compact dba design , and hence increases the focusing .",
    "similar to other light source lattices , it has been found advantageous to add vertical focusing to the bends  @xcite to relax the optics and reduce the strength of cell sextupoles by increasing the difference in their @xmath1  functions  @xcite .",
    "each matching cell has an extra quadrupole for a better optics matching , two 3/4 bends , with magnet positions adjusted to maintain the ring circumference  @xcite ( the current 358.53  mhz rf  system will be used ) , and quadrupole strengths adjusted to optimize @xmath1  functions and phase advance .    though the dba design has an advantage of a high brightness beam , its effect on the beam dynamics has to be verified .",
    "first , the lower emittance results in a higher particle density which increases probability of particle collisions inside the bunches and makes the touschek effect the limiting factor for the beam lifetime .",
    "secondly , the stronger focusing in the dba lattice increases beam sensitivity to magnetic and chromatic errors and generates larger chromaticity .",
    "the latter requires strong sextupole correctors which increase the amplitude dependent and non - linear chromatic aberrations .",
    "these effects tend to reduce the dynamic aperture , and if the aperture is not sufficient for momentum errors up to @xmath2 it will further reduce the touschek beam lifetime .",
    "adequate dynamic aperture is also important in order to minimize losses during horizontal oscillations of the injected beam .",
    "consequently , the low emittance design has to be optimized to achieve the maximum dynamic aperture .",
    "it is especially important to maximize the horizontal size of dynamic aperture to minimize the touschek effect and allow large injection oscillations in spear  3 .",
    "the improvement of dynamic aperture starts from optimization of linear optics and correction systems . in the following sections we review the modifications made to the initial lattice design and present tracking studies including effects of magnetic and chromatic errors , perturbation due to wigglers , and the effect of lattice periodicity .",
    "all of the tracking study has been done using the lego code  @xcite which employs element - by - element tracking based on symplectic integration techniques  @xcite . in a few cases we tested lego results against other available tracking codes and found good agreement . in our study we calculated dynamic aperture at injection point located at the symmetry point between arc cells where",
    "@xmath3  m and @xmath4  m. the other typical parameters were : number of tracking turns @xmath5 , linear chromaticity corrected to zero , and synchrotron oscillations included .",
    "typically , the error free dynamic aperture serves as an upper limit for the aperture with machine errors or with insertion devices ( i d ) .",
    "it is therefore important to maximize first the dynamic aperture for the ideal lattice without any magnetic or misalignment errors .",
    "maximizing the error free dynamic aperture necessarily involves optimization of linear optics and the chromaticity correction system , minimization of chromatic and high order effects , and optimizing the betatron tune .",
    "the dba cell optics was made to fit the existing 11.7  m cell length with the magnet positions constrained to provide @xmath6  m space for the insertion devices and with bend positions kept to fit to the current synchrotron light beam lines .",
    "this results in a compact dba design which leads to stronger focusing and , hence , increased beam sensitivity to machine errors .",
    "though the achromat lattice eliminates dispersion in the insertion devices and at injection , it limits the available positions for chromatic sextupoles to rather short dispersive regions between the bends and the middle quadrupole qfc .",
    "the close proximity of the sf and sd sextupoles reduces their effectiveness and requires larger strengths .    to relax the cell optics it has been found advantageous to add vertical focusing to the cell bends .",
    "this results in a better separation of horizontal and vertical focusing and reduces the quadrupole strength in the doublets .",
    "most importantly , due to increased @xmath7 at sd sextupoles it provides better optical separation between the sf and sd and reduces their strength . to further reduce the strengths of the sextupoles and qfc quadrupole , the bends were placed as far from the cell center as it is possible within existing geometric constraints .",
    "the choice for the phase advance in the arc cells was to be near @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this provides favorable conditions for local cancellation of : 1 )  geometric aberrations from arc sextupoles located @xmath10 apart , and 2 )  first order chromatic beta waves from sextupoles and quadrupoles located @xmath11 apart , as well as systematic quadrupole errors .",
    "it is worth to note that the high horizontal phase advance is due to the achromat design which requires @xmath12 between the bends .",
    "initially , the matching cells were designed to provide _",
    "i_-transformation between the two arcs in both planes  @xcite .",
    "this would give the advantage of having effectively a 14-period lattice since the matching cells would be virtually invisible in the first order to the on - momentum particles .",
    "generally , the high periodicity optics provides better cancellation of systematic errors .    with the above choices the total tune would be near @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to move the working tune away from the half integer resonance ,",
    "the phase advance in arc and/or matching cells has to be adjusted . to minimize the resistive wall impedance effects",
    "@xcite it is favorable to move the tune into the lower quarter on the tune plane ( @xmath15 ) . tracking studies showed that relaxing the phase advance through the matching cells improves the spear  3 off - momentum dynamic aperture since it reduces the chromaticity and the strengths of matching quads .",
    "on the other hand , relaxing the arc cells would increase the arc sextupole strengths because of unfavorable change of the cell @xmath1  functions at the sextupoles .",
    "the optimum phase conditions have been identified by performing a horizontal dynamic aperture scan across the matching cell phase advance @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the on - momentum and off - momentum dynamic aperture were maximized at about @xmath18 and @xmath19 per matching cell .    to minimize the effect of strong low order betatron resonances",
    "the location of the working tune on the tune plane has been chosen slightly below  .25 , away from the 3rd and 4th order resonance lines .",
    "the final choice ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) was based on favorable horizontal injection conditions and the results of dynamic aperture tune scan .",
    "the two dimensional diagram of horizontal dynamic aperture ( in number of @xmath22 ) versus @xmath23 and @xmath24 tune is shown in table  1 , where @xmath25  mm is the horizontal rms beam size at injection point . during the aperture",
    "scan the tune was varied by changing arc phase advance , and the lattice was kept matched at all tunes .",
    "the above scan also included a set of random machine errors which will be described in the following sections . with the chosen tune ,",
    "the phase advance per arc cell is @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the location of the working tune on the tune plane along with betatron resonance lines up to 4th order is shown in fig .",
    "[ y : f : tune ] .",
    ".horizontal dynamic aperture ( in number of @xmath28  mm ) versus @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the tracking included a set of random machine errors and 1% momentum error . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      at present ,",
    "seven horizontally deflecting wigglers are planned in the 3  m drifts between arc cells .",
    "the typical parameters of these insertion devices are : the peak field @xmath31 up to 2  t , and the total length up to 2.3  m. though the wiggler magnetic field is highly non - linear , some of its high order effects are locally canceled due to wiggler periodicity .",
    "the remaining lowest order perturbations to the beam optics are vertical focusing and amplitude - dependent vertical tune shift due to octupole - like horizontal field . in summary ,",
    "the wiggler effect on dynamic aperture can arise from perturbation of @xmath1 functions and tune , high order field effects , reduced periodicity and symmetry of the lattice , as well as wiggler field errors and misalignment .    in spear",
    "3 the wiggler perturbation of @xmath1 functions and phase advance will be locally corrected using doublet quadrupoles in the cells adjacent to either side of the wiggler  @xcite . tracking studies with seven wigglers showed that without high order wiggler effects , the corrected wiggler focusing alone does not reduce dynamic aperture . without this correction",
    "the vertical aperture reduces by about 20% , though it is still well outside the @xmath32  mm wiggler physical aperture .",
    "the study of wiggler multipole errors was based on recently measured systematic field errors in one of the strongest wigglers ( beamline  11 ) .",
    "the measured field data was fit to a set of normal and skew field multipoles up to 12th order and used as wiggler errors in the tracking .",
    "[ y : f : wig ] shows that when these systematic multipole errors are included , the dynamic aperture with seven wigglers reduces by about 10% .",
    "the effects of the non - linear wiggler field can further reduce the aperture .",
    "since these intrinsic high order fields are in the horizontal plane , they mostly affect the vertical aperture .",
    "simulation of the first two non - linear terms ( octupole and dodecapole - like field ) showed rather modest reduction of vertical aperture from 11  mm to 9  mm with the above systematic multipole errors included  @xcite .",
    "this aperture is still well outside the wiggler physical aperture .",
    "the advantage of a high periodicity lattice is that the number of resonances excited by systematic multipole field errors is reduced in proportion to the number of periods . in spear",
    "3 the matching cells break the 14  periodic arc cells and reduce the machine periodicity to  2 . to verify the effect of periodicity on dynamic aperture , we tracked particles in a lattice which had only 14  identical arc cells and compared the results to the aperture of the full lattice .",
    "the results for on - momentum particles are shown in fig .",
    "[ y : f : period ] .",
    "the two solid curves correspond to aperture without machine errors , and the dash curves define the aperture for 6 seeds of machine errors . in both cases the pure 14 periodic cells provide a larger dynamic aperture compared to the nominal lattice with matching cells . since without errors the only non - linear fields are from sextupoles , one can conclude that cancellation of systematic sextupole aberrations is much better in a more periodic lattice .",
    "another observation is that either breaking periodicity or including random machine errors will reduce the spear  3 aperture to about similar size .",
    "due to geometric constraints in the existing spear tunnel it was unavoidable to break the periodicity of arc cells . to keep the effective periodicity of  14 ,",
    "one of the earliest proposals suggested a @xmath33-transformation for the matching cell lattice between the arcs  @xcite .",
    "however , the matching cells also contribute a significant amount of chromaticity , and it was found that relaxing the matching cell optics improved the off - momentum dynamic aperture without compromising the on - momentum aperture .",
    "a long touschek lifetime and adequate injection conditions were the primary motivations to maximize the spear  3 dynamic aperture .",
    "the described optimization included linear optics , working tune , chromaticity and coupling correction , and compensation of wiggler focusing .",
    "other potential improvements were analyzed as well .",
    "the effects of large momentum oscillations , realistic machine errors , insertion devices and larger optics perturbations on dynamic aperture were verified .",
    "the results consistently showed that the dynamic aperture for up to @xmath2 momentum errors is not significantly affected by these effects .",
    "the presented analysis shows that spear  3 dynamic aperture will provide adequate injection conditions and result in @xmath34  hrs of touschek beam lifetime .",
