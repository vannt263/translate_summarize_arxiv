    "the study of finite - type invariants of immersions of the circle into the plane was initiated by v. arnold . in his paper ( @xcite )",
    ", he gave a description of the three basic invariants , corresponding three different components of the discriminant subspace in the space of the immersions : the closure of the immersions with a direct self - tangency ( @xmath0 ) , the closure of the immersions with an inverse self - tangency ( @xmath1 ) , and the closure of the immersions with a triple point ( @xmath2 ) ( for the details see  @xcite ) .",
    "he also noticed , that circle immersions into a plane are closely related to legendrian knots in a solid torus @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , a projection of a legendrian knot along the @xmath4 is a plane curve .",
    "we call the union of @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of the discriminant subspace the @xmath5-discriminant . a finite - type invariant associated with the @xmath5-discriminant",
    "is referred to as @xmath5-invariant .    in the paper  @xcite v.",
    "goryunov introduces the notion of a marked chord diagrams , describing the combinatorics of a non - generic legendrian knot in the solid torus , and presents a universal finite - type invariant for such immersions , which gives rise to the universal finite - type @xmath0-invariant of circle immersions . in his 1997 article , j.",
    "w.  hill shows that any relation on symbols of finite - type invariants of legendrian knots without so - called dangerous self - tangencies in a solid torus is a consequence of certain relations , which are called @xmath6-marked 4t - relations . for the details",
    "see  @xcite .    the notion of framed chord diagram ( see the definition below ) appeared in an attempt to understand the combinatorics @xmath5-invariants in the paper of s.  lando ( see  @xcite ) . by an analogy with the knots",
    "finite - type invariant theory , a framed chord diagram represents the combinatorial type of a non - generic immersion , admitting simple self - tangencies ( both direct and inverse ) as singularities .",
    "similarly to the knots case , the symbol of a finite - type invariant of immersions gives rise to a functional on the space of framed chord diagrams .",
    "of course , not every functional comes from a finite - type invariant , and it turns out that those that actually come from a finite - type invariant must satisfy the framed 4t - relations ( see the definitions below ) .",
    "hill s results imply , that the framed 4t - relations are not only necessary , but also sufficient for a functional to come from a @xmath5-invariant .",
    "the filtered space of knot finite - type invariants is dual to the bialgebra of knots with singular knot filtration ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the induced graded hopf algebra structure on the space of ordinary chord diagrams implies that the latter is just a polynomial algebra .",
    "@xmath5-invariants admit a natural product , which gives rise to a well - defined coproduct on the vector space of framed chord diagrams . however , it is not clear yet whether the space of framed chord diagrams admits a nice product , which makes the study of the space more difficult .    in this note",
    "we partly fix the lack of algebra structure on the space of framed chord diagrams by providing it with a hopf module structure over the hopf algebra of ( non - framed ) chord diagrams .    weight system ( or , simply speaking , linear map from the space of chord diagrams satisfying 4t - relations ) is a very important notion in the knots finite - type invariants theory , as , due to the vassiliev - kontsevich theorem , it allows to construct knots invariants .",
    "we prove , that any weight system admits a lifting to a framed weight system via the discoloration operator ( see the definition in the section 3 ) .",
    "the comodule structure on the space of framed chord diagrams also gives a way to produce framed weight systems .",
    "the space of framed chord diagrams admits a well - defined map to the space of framed graphs ( introduced in  @xcite ) , induced by the operation of taking the intersection graph of a diagram .",
    "it turns out , that a framed version of the chromatic polynomial can be defined , and also used to construct a framed weight system .",
    "this note is the natural development of the ideas of  @xcite .",
    "it consists of the introduction and three sections . the hopf module structure on the space of framed chord diagrams",
    "is introduced in section 1 .",
    "section 2 is devoted to similar properties of the space of framed graphs .",
    "the description of a framed chromatic polynomial , along with two methods of construction of framed weight systems are presented in the section  3 .",

    "i also thank s. lando for the interest and valuable comments that helped to make the text easier to understand .",

    "let us first recall the definition of the algebra of chord diagrams @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 .",
    "an _ order @xmath10 chord diagram _ is a collection of @xmath10 chords   pairs of pairwise distinct points on an oriented circle , considered up to orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle .    in the figures below ,",
    "the points in a pair forming a chord are drawn connected by an arc .",
    "the space @xmath8 is the space spanned by the set of the chord diagrams modulo the _ 4t - relations _ , shown in figure  [ 4 t ] ( a ) .    the pictures in figure  [ 4 t ] should be understood as follows .",
    "it is assumed that the dashed part of the circle may contain other chords endpoints , but their combinatorial structure is the same for all the four diagrams entering the relation .",
    "only the chords whose endpoints are inside solid intervals are shown explicitly .",
    "one of the explicitly shown chords is again the same for all the diagrams involved .",
    "we refer to the chord that is not shared by all the diagrams in the relation as the _ jumping chord_.    the space @xmath8 is endowed with a natural product @xmath11 , a natural coproduct @xmath12 , the unit @xmath13 , the counit @xmath14 , and the antipode @xmath15 , making @xmath8 into a commutative cocommutative hopf algebra .",
    "the multiplication is given by glueing two diagrams , and the coproduct is given by summing up the tensor products of pairs of chord diagrams formed by a decomposition of the set of chords into two complimentary subsets .",
    "for the precise definitions of the maps , we refer the reader to  @xcite , section 4.4 .",
    "we define the space @xmath16 of framed chord diagrams following lando  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 .",
    "order @xmath10 framed chord diagram _ is a chord diagram along with a fixed _ framing_. a framing is a map from the set of chords to @xmath17 .",
    "the preimages of @xmath18 under this map are called _ oriented chords _ , the preimages of @xmath19 are called _ disorienting chords_.    an example of a framed chord diagram is shown in figure  [ fcd ] .",
    "a framed chord diagram is said to be _ white _ if all its chords are disorienting .",
    "a framed chord diagram is said to be _ black _ if all its chords are oriented .",
    "we consider framed chord diagrams as generating elements of a @xmath7-vector space @xmath20 over @xmath7 .",

    ", this easily follows from the framed 4t - relations .",
    "it is enough to use only the relations that do not change the number of oriented chords .",
    "the proof of the fact that the product does not depend on the choice of the cut - point of @xmath21 repeats word - for - word the proof that the natural map from the algebra of circular chord diagrams to the algebra of linear chord diagrams is well - defined ( see  @xcite , section 4.7 ) .",
    "the cut - point of @xmath22 choice independence follows by a direct generalization of the corresponding proof in the non - framed case ( see  @xcite , lemma 4.13 ) , since the framing of the jumping chord remains unchanged under a jump along an oriented chord .",
