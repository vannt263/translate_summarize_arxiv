    "explaining the observed number counts of high - redshift submillimetre ( submm ) galaxies ( smgs , which are traditionally defined as having 850-  flux density @xmath10 mjy ; see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) has long been a challenging problem for hierarchical galaxy formation models .",
    "thus , smgs have attracted much interest from theoreticians ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to explain the observed counts , some have resorted to significant modifications of their models , such as the use of a top - heavy initial mass function ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that single dish - detected smgs are a heterogeneous population .",
    "although some fraction of smgs show strong evidence for being merger - induced starbursts , a significant fraction seem to be early - stage mergers in which the components have projected separation @xmath11 kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ; for a thorough discussion of the observational evidence , see @xcite ) . in (",
    "* hereafter h13 ) , we presented a model for the smg population that includes the following physically distinct subpopulations : 1 .",
    "merger - induced starbursts ; 2 .",
    "early - stage mergers in which the galaxies are not yet strongly interacting but are blended into a single submm source in single - dish surveys , which we term ` galaxy - pair smgs ' ; and 3 . isolated discs .",
    "furthermore , there is anecdotal evidence that physically and spatially unassociated galaxies blended into a single submm source also contribute to the population @xcite .",
    "however , the contribution of the last subpopulation is currently very poorly constrained , and it is not included in the h13 model .    except for h13 , all published theoretical models do not treat the effects of blending . in the h13 model ,",
    "the galaxy - pair smgs contribute significantly to the population at all fluxes , but merger - induced starbursts dominate at the bright end . for @xmath12 mjy ,",
    "the counts predicted by the h13 model are in good agreement with those of single - dish surveys , and the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) counts that we predicted have since been shown to agree very well with observations @xcite .",
    "however , for higher fluxes , the observed alma counts decrease significantly more steeply at the bright end than both the single - dish counts and the alma counts predicted by h13 because the brightest ( @xmath13 mjy ) single - dish - detected smgs are almost all resolved into two or more sources .",
    "this result is indeed very surprising .",
    "@xcite suggest that their results imply an upper limit on the star formation rate ( sfr ) of an smg of @xmath14 ( for a @xcite imf ; for a @xcite imf , the sfr limit is a factor of @xmath15 lower ) .",
    "based on a gas consumption time - scale argument that assumes that smgs are starbursts , they argue that this limit implies that the space density of galaxies with gas mass @xmath16 is @xmath17 mpc@xmath18 . in this letter",
    ", we elaborate on this proposed limit by 1 . using the results of dust radiative transfer calculations to infer the sfr limit that corresponds to a range of flux limits and 2 . presenting a redshift - dependent stellar mass limit that applies to all constituents of the smg population , not just starbursts . for simplicity",
    ", we treat the flux density limit suggested by observations as a strict upper limit , but in reality , it only implies an upper limit on the number density of smgs that are brighter than the limit ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the h13 predictions depend on the assumed stellar mass function ( smf ) , which is especially uncertain at high masses and high redshifts .",
    "thus , it is potentially interesting to remove the components of the h13 model that depend on the smf and instead work ` backwards ' , i.e. , make inferences about smg demographics from the observations . in this letter",
    ", we use the relationship among submm flux density , sfr , and dust mass predicted by our hydrodynamical simulations and dust radiative transfer to infer an sfr limit from the cutoff flux density suggested by recent observations . furthermore , because our model predicts submm flux density as a function of stellar mass and redshift for quiescently star - forming galaxies ( i.e. , isolated discs and the individual components of ` galaxy - pair ' smgs )  and at fixed stellar mass , starburst smgs should have higher submm flux density than quiescently star - forming smgs  we can also predict an upper limit on the stellar mass of smgs .",
    "dust radiative transfer performed on hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies and galaxy mergers suggests that the submm flux of a galaxy at @xmath19 can be parameterized as a power law of the sfr and dust mass ( @xmath0 ) to within @xmath20 dex ( * ? ? ?",
    "the physical reason underlying the parameterization is that the radiation and dust are in thermal equilibrium ; the specific form can be motivated by a toy model of single - temperature dust that is optically thin to its own emission @xcite .",
    "the parameterization is relatively insensitive to the dust geometry and the sub - resolution dust obscuration model , and it agrees well with the results of grasil @xcite calculations ( a. benson , private communication ) .",
    "consequently , one can infer the sfr of a galaxy from its submm flux , albeit with some uncertainty caused by the dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "solving for the sfr in equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) of h13 ( which were derived from simulated smgs with @xmath21 mjy , so extension to higher fluxes is an extrapolation ) , we have @xmath22 where the subscripts of the sfr variables denote the flux from which the sfr is inferred and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the 850-@xmath25 and 1.1-mm flux densities , respectively . and @xmath2 are identical to @xmath23 and use them interchangeably because the conversions amongst them are insignificant for our purposes . ]",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "only recently have interferometrically observed ( sub)mm continuum maps of large ( i.e. , containing more than @xmath33 ) , relatively unbiased samples of less - luminous ( i.e. , @xmath34 mjy ) smgs become available .",
    "most notably , @xcite mapped a sample of 122 smgs from the laboca extended _ chandra _ deep field south submillimetre survey ( less ; @xcite ; for the description of the alma follow - up , see hodge et al .",
    ", submitted ) .",
    "at all fluxes , a significant fraction ( at least tens of per cent ) of the smgs were resolved into two or more components by alma .",
    "as mentioned above , the brightest single - dish smgs were all resolved into multiple sources ; none of the resolved sources have @xmath13 mjy .",
    "the interferometrically imaged samples presented in @xcite and @xcite also tentatively support a steeper cutoff at the bright end than expected based on the single - dish counts , although for these samples , the cutoff occurs at a higher flux density ( @xmath35 mjy ) , and there are some sources that are potentially brighter than the cutoff ( see section [ s : outliers ] for details ) .",
    "the flux density at which the cutoff occurs may depend on the field because of cosmic variance ( i.e. , the highest overdensity sampled can vary from field to field ) or the different beam sizes of the interferometers used .    because submm flux depends weakly on sfr @xcite ,",
    "the inferred sfr limit is sensitive to the maximum value of the submm flux observed .",
    "the sfr limit is also sensitive to the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 values inferred from fitting the far - infrared spectral energy distributions of smgs can be in excess of @xmath36 but are often lower ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the accuracy to which @xmath0 can be determined is still debated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we will determine the sfr range that corresponds to @xmath2 cutoffs in the range @xmath37 mjy for a range of @xmath0 values that are characteristic of those inferred for smgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : sfr_vs_flux ] indicates the @xmath38 mjy limit with a vertical dashed ( dotted ) line .",
    "the corresponding sfr limits for @xmath28 are shown as blue ( black ) horizontal lines .",
    "assuming @xmath28 , @xmath2 limits in the range @xmath3 mjy correspond to maximum sfrs in the range @xmath39 .",
    "note that the sfr limit for @xmath40 is similar to that proposed by @xcite .",
    "limit that corresponds to an @xmath2 limit in the range @xmath3 mjy , where a higher @xmath2 limit corresponds to a higher @xmath5 limit .",
    "see the text for details regarding the calculation of the limit.,width=302 ]    in the h13 model , both isolated disc galaxies ( which dominate the faint , i.e. , @xmath41 mjy , smg population ) and the galaxy - pair smgs ( i.e. , early - stage mergers in which the discs are not yet strongly interacting ) form stars quiescently ( as opposed to via the starburst mode ) . the h13 relations for the redshift evolution of the gas content , size , and metallicity of galaxies can be used to predict a quiescently star - forming galaxy s sfr and @xmath0 as a function of its @xmath5 and @xmath42 . because the ( sub)mm flux of our simulated galaxies can be parameterized as a function of sfr and @xmath0 alone , the h13 model can be used to determine the ( sub)mm flux as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath42 ( see equations 17 and 18 of h13 ) .",
    "thus for a given redshift , the smg selection effectively selects the most massive quiescently star - forming galaxies on the main sequence because the @xmath23@xmath5 relation predicted by our model for fixed redshift is monotonic ( although in practice , scatter in the sfr@xmath5 relation will cause scatter in the @xmath23@xmath5 relation ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the observed flux density limits can be translated into upper limits on @xmath5 as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "[ fig : max_mstar_vs_z ] shows the inferred @xmath5 limit versus @xmath42 for an @xmath2 limit in the range @xmath3 mjy .",
    "this limit is calculated by combining the redshift - dependent sfr@xmath5 relation predicted by our model , which is tied to the dependence of galaxy gas fractions and sizes on @xmath5 and @xmath42 , and the dependence of the dust mass on @xmath5 and @xmath42 , which depends on the gas fraction and metallicity evolution . then",
    ", the flux limit and the @xmath5 and @xmath0 functions are substituted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfr_850 ] ) , and the resulting equation is solved for @xmath5 .",
    "because our model predicts an sfr@xmath5 relation that shifts upward as @xmath42 increases , the mass limit decreases with redshift .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that the brightest quiescently star - forming smgs are at higher redshifts than the median for the smg population if the high - mass end of the stellar mass function evolves less rapidly than the mass limit plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : max_mstar_vs_z ]",
    ". relation no longer increases .",
    "observationally , the normalisation of the sfr@xmath5 relation seems to increase with redshift out to @xmath43 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; whether the trend continues to higher redshift is still an open question ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "] indeed , we shall see below that most of the very few sources with @xmath44 mjy have redshifts significantly greater than the median redshift of the population .",
    "the @xmath5 limit that corresponds to an @xmath2 limit of @xmath3 mjy ranges from @xmath6 at @xmath7 to @xmath45 at @xmath9 .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the specific sfr , ssfr @xmath46 sfr@xmath47 . in the h13 model , the @xmath5 and @xmath42 dependence of the ssfr are determined by the dependence of galaxy gas fractions and sizes on @xmath5 and @xmath42 . at fixed redshift , ssfr decreases with @xmath5 ; the scaling is similar to that of the star - forming galaxies in the @xcite sample , ssfr @xmath48 . at fixed @xmath5 , ssfr increases with redshift .",
    "for example , a galaxy with @xmath49 , approximately the minimum @xmath5 necessary for a main sequence galaxy to contribute to the smg population ( see fig . 3 of h13 ) , has ssfr that ranges from 0.4  @xmath50 at @xmath7 to 6.7  @xmath50 at @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , we expect the higher - redshift main sequence smgs to have higher ssfrs .",
    "furthermore , the h13 model suggests that main sequence smgs should have ssfr @xmath51 .      in the h13 model ,",
    "merger - induced starbursts contribute significantly to the smg population , and they dominate the bright ( i.e. , @xmath52 mjy ) end of the population .",
    "merger - induced starbursts can be outliers from the main sequence ( i.e. , have higher sfr for a fixed @xmath5 , but not all merger - induced starbursts are outliers from the main sequence ; @xcite ) . indeed",
    ", observations indicate that smgs are a mix of main sequence members and outliers @xcite .",
    "( note that , as discussed below , some of the smgs that are outliers from the main sequence could also be gravitationally unstable discs . )",
    "if the sources with flux density near the proposed cutoff flux density all lie significantly above the sfr@xmath5 relation , then the upper limit on @xmath5 presented in section [ s : quiescent_sf ] would overestimate the true @xmath5 limit .    in the merger simulations of h13 , which can account for the observed abundance of smgs that are fainter than the possible flux limit , the highest sfr attained is @xmath53 .",
    "the peak sfr is typically limited by gas consumption rather than agn feedback ; even without agn feedback , an sfr in excess of @xmath54 can only be sustained for a few @xmath55 myr unless fresh gas is supplied to the galaxy at a comparable rate .",
    "thus , the potential sfr limit discussed in this work may simply be a consequence of limited gas supply , as argued by @xcite , rather than evidence for strong feedback during the starburst .",
    "also , note that the starburst driven at coalescence in major mergers can elevate the ssfr beyond the aforementioned maximum for quiescently star - forming galaxies . in simulations of mergers with baryonic mass ratio @xmath56 ,",
    "the ssfr can be boosted by @xmath57 for a very short period ( @xmath58 myr at most ) and a factor of a few for as long as @xmath59 myr .",
    "we have performed a literature search to identify smgs for which interferometric continuum imaging indicates @xmath44 mjy ; they are especially interesting targets for follow - up observations to determine whether they are indeed brighter than the proposed flux limit and to discern the physical nature of these potentially extreme sources .",
    "we are aware of seven sources at @xmath60 ( we are uninterested in low-@xmath42 interlopers ) that are at least 1@xmath61 and eight additional sources that are possibly brighter than the @xmath35 mjy cutoff .",
    "the names of these sources , their flux densities , and references to the interferometric continuum observations of which we are aware that confirm the high fluxes are presented in table [ tab : outliers ] .    many of the sources that are potentially brighter than the proposed flux limit are from the aztec survey of a subfield of the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; @xcite ) field performed by @xcite .",
    "the number counts inferred by @xcite for a larger subfield that contains the @xcite field are significantly higher at the bright end than those derived from the similar - sized submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) half degree extragalactic survey ( shades ) field @xcite .",
    "the brighter sources tend to coincide with overdensities of galaxies at @xmath62 , which may suggest that galaxy - galaxy lensing is responsible for the excess of bright sources @xcite",
    ". some of the other brightest sources may also be lensed .",
    "however , it is unlikely that lensing is responsible for all of the sources that are potentially brighter than the proposed flux density limit , and it is worthwhile to consider whether the sources that are brighter than the proposed limit are exceptional in some manner . as we argued above , many of the brightest sources are at redshifts significantly greater than the median redshift of the smg population ( @xmath63 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , gn20 and gn10 are both located in a @xmath64 protocluster @xcite , aztec1 is at @xmath65 @xcite , and br1202 - 0725 north and south are in a @xmath66 overdensity .",
    "the scarcity of bright sources at higher redshifts may be caused by a lack of sufficiently massive galaxies at those redshifts @xcite and/or insufficient dust content because of the limited time available to produce dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if indeed the bulk of the sources brighter than the proposed cutoff are at @xmath67 , this result may suggest that the normalisation of the sfr@xmath5 relation continues to increase to at least that redshift ; otherwise , there would be no clear reason for the brightest sources to be preferentially at @xmath67 , and the evolution of both the stellar mass function and dust content of galaxies should tend to make the brightest smgs _ less _ abundant at those redshifts .    as an example of what can potentially be learned from detailed follow - up of the sources that are potentially brighter than the proposed cutoff , we consider the case of gn20 @xcite , which is an especially interesting and well - studied source .",
    "recent high - resolution interferometric observations performed with the very large array ( vla ) indicate that gn20 is a very extended ( @xmath68 kpc in diameter ) gas - rich disc that contains at least five molecular gas clumps , each of which contain a few percent of the total molecular gas mass of the galaxy @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the redshift evolution of the sfr@xmath5 relation alone can not account for the extremely high flux density of gn20 ( which does not seem to be lensed ; @xcite ) : fig .",
    "[ fig : max_mstar_vs_z ] indicates that at @xmath69 , a galaxy with @xmath70 would have @xmath12 mjy , and the inferred @xmath5 value for gn20 ( @xmath71 ; @xcite ) is less than this value .",
    "thus , gn20 seems to be an outlier from the main sequence ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : its ssfr is @xmath72 @xcite , but in our model , a @xmath69 main sequence galaxy with @xmath73 has ssfr @xmath74 , @xmath75 less than that of gn20 .",
    "the simplest interpretation of gn20 is that it is an extremely massive , gas - rich , gravitationally unstable disc undergoing rapid fragmentation , but whether such galaxies constitute a significant fraction of the smg population is unclear .",
    "recent interferometric imaging of single - dish - detected smgs has demonstrated that most of the brightest ( @xmath76 mjy ) sources are actually multiple distinct sources blended into a single source . in this letter , we have used the relationship among submm flux density , sfr , and dust mass predicted by our combination of hydrodynamical simulations and dust radiative transfer and the redshift evolution of the sfr@xmath5 and @xmath0@xmath5 relations predicted by the h13 model to predict limits on the sfrs and stellar masses of smgs from the sharp cutoff in the number counts suggested by recent observations . for @xmath1 ,",
    "an @xmath2 limit in the range @xmath3 mjy corresponds to an sfr limit in the range @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 limit ranges from @xmath6 at @xmath7 to @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "follow - up observations of the sources that are potentially brighter than the proposed flux limit are crucial for understanding whether these sources are exceptional in some sense ( besides their bright submm fluxes ) .",
    "are they predominantly merger - induced starbursts , gravitationally unstable discs , or something else ? such observations may yield new insight into star formation and feedback at high redshift",
    ".    however , one should be cautious when attempting to make inferences about the smg population as a whole from observations of potentially extreme objects such as gn20 , which is one of the brightest smgs known and , contrary to nave expectations , is an extended very gas - rich disc galaxy rather than a starburst @xcite . because the h13 model , which does not include violently unstable discs , can largely account for the observed smg number counts , it is not clear that the smg population must include a significant number of such objects .",
    "even if some smgs are massive , gas - rich , gravitationally unstable discs , this does not directly imply that they are fueled by ` cold - mode accretion ' @xcite , as has been suggested by some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "rather , it simply requires that the discs are sufficiently gas - rich to be gravitationally unstable and is agnostic regarding the method of gas supply ( see @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "finally , we note that we have not attempted to reconcile the discrepancy between the counts predicted by h13 and those of @xcite in this work .",
    "one potential reason for the discrepancy is that in h13 , we did not include the effects of blending of physically and spatially unassociated galaxies .",
    "we also did not include mergers of more than two galaxies .",
    "these potential contributions will be modeled in future work .",
