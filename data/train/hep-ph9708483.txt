    "the possibility that the neutrinos @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 produced in weak interactions are coherent combinations of almost degenerate mass eigenstates has attracted great attention in the particle physics community @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the mass splitting required to explain the atmospheric and the solar neutrino flux deficits in terms of neutrino oscillations are much smaller than the mass required for cosmological purposes , as will be discussed below in this first section .",
    "most of the works focused on the _ ansatze _ for the neutrino mass matrix : @xmath3 small corrections , and on the study of the corresponding theoretical motivations and phenomenological implications .",
    "inevitably , this _ ansatze _ implies a signal for neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath4 ) experiments if @xmath5 few evs , of interest for cosmological considerations . allowing a departure from this mass pattern , the authors of @xcite outlined a scenario in which the neutrinos have masses in the sub - ev range and could produce a signal in next generation searches of @xmath6 it was later proven that it is possible @xcite to incorporate a massive neutrino in the ev range in the context of models with abelian family symmetry , in a way marginally consistent with the @xmath4 bounds .    in the present work we do not commit _ a priori _ ourselves to",
    "any given pattern for the neutrino mass matrix , and concentrate on finding a picture of the neutrino masses and mixing angles that is consistent with the phenomenological observations , and with the hypothesis of massive neutrinos in the cosmologically interesting range .",
    "we will show that these hypotheses are quite restrictive , implying that the corresponding scenario is likely to be confirmed or disproved by forthcoming experiments .    in its phenomenological character ,",
    "our approach is very similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize in the present study the importance of the direct search for neutrino masses , as crucial test of the scenario under discussion .",
    "another difference with @xcite is in the fact that the authors of that work concentrate on the msw solution of the solar neutrino problem @xcite , whereas we focus on the vacuum oscillation solution @xcite ; in this respect , the two analysis complement each other .",
    "the lagrangian of neutrino masses in the basis where the charged lepton masses are diagonal is ( bispinorial notation ) : @xmath7 the lorentz indices are contracted according to @xmath8 @xmath9 the symmetric matrix @xmath10 can be decomposed as : @xmath11 ( in compact notation : @xmath12 ) , where @xmath13 is the unitary matrix of mixing angles and phases .",
    "the three nonnegative and nondecreasing real numbers @xmath14 are the majorana neutrino masses . introducing the bispinors",
    "@xmath15 : @xmath16 and the majorana four - spinor in the chiral representation : @xmath17 we can finally rewrite the mass lagrangian in the standard form : @xmath18 the mass difference is denoted as : @xmath19 it enters for instance in the expression @xmath20 of the probability of oscillation in vacuum from a flavour @xmath21 to @xmath22 in fact we can replace : @xmath23 by @xmath24 under the assumption ( which holds in the cases of interest ) that the neutrino momentum @xmath25 is much larger than the neutrino masses .",
    "the scenario under discussion can now be defined by letting in first approximation : @xmath26 the value of @xmath27 is fixed below , with the help of cosmological considerations . before passing to that , we further specify two sub - cases of this scenario , by making the assumption that the squared mass differences are in ranges of interest to the solar and the atmospheric neutrino problems . case a is defined by : @xmath28 in case b the two mass differences are inverted ( compare with fig .  1 in last section ) . since ,",
    "apart from this fact ( and neglecting matter effects on the propagation of neutrinos ) , the two cases are phenomenologically equivalent , we will concentrate the discussion on case a.      there are various indications of the existence of dark matter ( dm  see for instance @xcite ) , that may constitute the main component of the universe .",
    "once the amount of dark matter , ordinary matter and , possible other components are specified , one can attempt a comparison of the observed structure with the one predicted in terms of the spectrum of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "the gross features of the universe can be explained by the cold dm model , that assumes ( 1 ) that the dominant component of dm is cold ( non relativistic at the moment of decoupling ) , ( 2 ) a nearly scale invariant ( harrison - zeldovich ) primordial spectrum , ( 3 ) and that the parameter @xmath29 is 1 , which implies that the total energy density is equal to the critical density @xmath30 ( the latter two hypothesis are suggested by inflationary scenarios ) .",
    "however cobe data have indicated the need of a certain departure from this simple cosmological model @xcite .",
    "the hot+cold dm model @xcite achieves an optimal agreement with the data if the hot dm constitutes the @xmath31% of the energy density , the cold one the @xmath32% , and the baryonic matter approximatively 1 tenth of the total energy density 100 km sec@xmath33 mpc@xmath33 turns out to be around @xmath34 in @xcite the observational range @xmath35 is suggested ; a more recent analysis @xcite gives @xmath36 as the reference range .",
    "even lower values , @xmath37 have been advocated in @xcite . ] .",
    "massive neutrinos are natural candidates for hot dm , and this is the assumption we are interested to consider . the number density of neutrinos @xmath38 can be computed in the big - bang model @xcite . once they become non - relativistic , their energy density reduces simply to @xmath39 assuming @xmath40 and introducing the ratio of @xmath41 to the critical density @xmath30 ( proportional to @xmath42 ) one arrives at the expression that relates the neutrino masses to the cosmological parameters : @xmath43   \\times \\left [ \\frac{h}{0.6 } \\right]^2 .   \\label{cosm}\\ ] ] the neutrino mass differences implied by solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits ( [ figs ] ) are small in comparison with the mass in eq .",
    "( [ cosm ] ) , and this facts suggest the hypothesis of nearly degenerate neutrinos . using eqs .",
    "( [ majorhp ] ) and ( [ cosm ] ) together with the informations from the study of the structure evolution , we are lead to the following reference value for @xmath44 @xmath45 this corresponds to @xmath46 and @xmath47 or , with approximation of 5% , to @xmath48 and @xmath49 progress in the determination of @xmath50 and @xmath29 will provide tests of the hot+cold dm scenario , and also , if the scenario will be confirmed , a better determination of the parameter @xmath51    we briefly comment on the possibility that massive neutrinos may constitute the major component of the dm .",
    "it was suggested that this could happen if special seeds of primordial fluctuations like those originated by the cosmic strings @xcite play a major role in the process of structure evolution , or , alternatively , if neutrinos participate in exotic long - range ( nongravitational ) interactions @xcite .",
    "however , apart from any theoretical justification , if this alternative scenario is correct , and @xmath40 the reference value of the parameter @xmath27 would be larger than 10 ev , since @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ cosm ] ) increases almost @xmath52 times .    of course",
    ", it is a major assumption to consider the absence of light sterile neutrinos , that could play various roles , and in particular could give the dominant contribution to the hot dm content of the universe @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of ( standard model ) singlet neutrinos could be tested if they are mixed with the ordinary ones , and participate in the oscillations . regarding this point ,",
    "if neutrino masses are the explanation not only of the solar and of the atmospheric neutrino problems , but _ also _ of the lsnd data on @xmath53 @xcite and on @xmath54 flux conversion @xcite , major modifications of the scenario , like the introduction of a sterile neutrino would be required .",
    "therefore , in order to check the scenario under discussion ( in which no light sterile neutrino is present and a negligible signal at lsnd is expected ) it will be crucial to see if the lsnd findings will be confirmed by the forthcoming upgraded karmen @xcite and/or by other experiments .",
    "in this section we discuss the bounds on the neutrino masses and mixing angles that can be deduced from the absence ( 1 ) of positive indications of electron neutrino mass in the tritium decay experiments ; ( 2 ) of neutrinoless double beta decay signal ; ( 3 ) of appreciable disappearance of electron neutrino flux in reactor experiments .",
    "the constraints are considered in order of relevance for the scenario with three almost degenerate neutrinos .",
    "if one ( or more ) of the related experiments finds a signal , one ( or more ) parameters of the model will be determined .",
    "we stress that , in the model under discussion , @xmath55 the direct detection of neutrino mass seems to be possible , and that @xmath56 condition ( 2 ) implies a strong restriction on the mixing angles , that will further strengthen if future @xmath57 experiments will continue to give a null result .",
    "let us denote by @xmath58/d e_e$ ] the differential electron spectrum in beta decay supposing that @xmath59 coincides with the electron neutrino . in the general case , in which the electron neutrino is not a mass eigenstate , the beta spectrum @xmath60 is the weighted combination : @xmath61}{d e_e}\\ |u_{ei}|^2\\   \\theta(\\delta m -m_{\\nu_i}-e_e )   , \\ ] ] where the heaveside function @xmath62 enters the formula due to kinematical requirements , and @xmath63 is the difference between the mass of the decaying nucleus and that of the final nucleus . in our case ,",
    "due to ( [ majorhp ] ) , the unitarity relation @xmath64 implies a constraint straightforwardly on the common mass @xmath51    stringent limits can be derived by the experimental study of endpoint spectrum in tritium decay , after taking into account in some way the problematic indication of negative masses squared common to most recent experiments ( corresponding to the presence of a _ bump _ in the endpoint region ) . in the most recent experimental analysis @xcite , still under progress",
    ", new parameters unrelated to the neutrino mass are introduced . the upper limit obtained",
    ", @xmath65 ev@xmath66 implies : @xmath67 summing the errors in quadrature .",
    "the limit ( [ trit ] ) is not very different from those obtained by other experiments ; it could be further strengthened to 2.2 ev if the bump would be fully understood @xcite .",
    "the limits on neutrino mass from sn1987a obtained by the measured spread in time ( which is related to the original spread in energy and to the duration of the neutrino pulse ) are significatively looser , @xmath68(sn1987a ) @xmath69 ev .",
    "however , the observation of neutrinos from a very distant supernova could yield a competitive or even better bound in future .",
    "the following remarks should clearly illustrate that , in the scenario with nearly degenerate neutrinos , the direct search for neutrino mass is of cosmological relevance :    1 .",
    "the `` preferred '' value ( [ preferred ] ) is quite close to the limit ( [ trit ] ) : @xmath70 therefore , the hot+cold dm model can be ruled out or confirmed by a slight increase in the precision of the measurements .",
    "we stress once more the importance of a clear theoretical description of the structure of the endpoint spectrum in tritium decay studies .",
    "2 .   for @xmath71",
    "the limit ( [ trit ] ) disfavours @xmath72 in the hot+cold dm model .",
    "increasingly precise measurements of the cosmological paramenters and numerical simulations will be important in narrowing the parameter space of the model .",
    "the scenarios in which @xmath41 dominates the energy density of universe and that have @xmath73 require @xmath74 ev , and therefore can already be excluded in the present context .",
    "the limit ( [ trit ] ) ( the preferred value ( [ cosm ] ) ) are approximatively 6 times ( 3 times ) larger than the limit obtained by searches of neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite : @xmath75 we disregard in the following the possibility of large errors in the estimation of the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the bound ( [ nnn ] ) implies a cancellation in the contributions to @xmath76 with a precision of @xmath77 % .",
    "let us first analyze the case in which the neutrinoless double beta decay is strongly suppressed , which implies @xmath78 this equation can be represented geometrically as a triangle in the complex plane .",
    "therefore it can be satisfied only if the sum of the length of two sides is not smaller than the length of the third side .",

    "we show below that quite a precise pattern of the mixing matrix can be figured out insisting on this scheme , and on the consistency with the experimental data .",
    "( [ db ] ) implies that there is at most one small mixing matrix element @xmath84 and even in this case the other two elements correspond to maximal mixing angle .",
    "the presence of large mixings , that was generally noticed in previous studies @xcite is simply a consequence of the absence of signal in @xmath85 searches in these models .",
    "it was remarked that the scenarios with large lepton mixing tend to be disfavoured by the comparison of the observed sn1987a neutrino energy spectrum and the theoretical spectra @xcite .",
    "therefore , a clear understanding of the mechanism of neutrinos emission and propagation in the process of stellar collapse could provide us with the most direct way to exclude the neutrino scenario under discussion .",
    "we will not speculate further on this idea in the present work , and concentrate instead on the study of possible patterns of the mixing matrix .",

    "using @xmath123 we find for the double - ratio @xmath124 @xmath125 kamiokande @xcite and superkamiokande @xcite measurements in the multi - gev energy region suggest @xmath126 and this implies that @xmath127 has to be close to @xmath128 to produce a large suppression factor .",
    "however , the data are much better fitted if a linear dependence of the spectrum from the cosine of the zenith angle @xmath129 is also introduced : @xmath130 this favours not - so - large values of @xmath98 in such a way that the averaging effect is reduced for smaller neutrino travel distance ( around @xmath131 km , corresponding to @xmath129 in a neighbourhood of 0 ) and it is maximal for neutrinos produced in the antipodal regions ( produced at @xmath132 km far apart from the detector , that is for @xmath133 ) .",
    "so the averaged oscillations would take place at maximal distances only : @xmath134 which should be compared with the smallest possible theoretical value , @xmath135 this is not excluded by the data , the errors in each of the @xmath136 data points being around 0.1 ( except for @xmath137 where the errors are @xmath138 times larger ) .",
    "but while waiting for more precise data , one has to keep in mind that the model considered suggests somewhat smaller flux suppression than measured at present .",

    "the second term gives the oscillating factor , whereas the first term can give an additional ( constant in energy ) suppression .",

    "this can somewhat diminish the spectrum distortion and the seasonal variations that are correlated characteristics of the vacuum - oscillation mechanism @xcite .",
    "if , beside that , we suppose that the oscillations are effectively averaged ( requiring that the splitting @xmath144 is large in comparison with @xmath145 ev@xmath96 ) , the probability of suppression is close to the maximal _ averaged _ value @xmath146 this may be of relevance for neutrinos emitted by a supernova , or maybe for solar neutrinos themselves @xcite .",
    "we summarize our findings in fig .  1 , which visualizes the flavour content @xmath147 of the massive neutrinos @xmath59 in the way used in @xcite to present a panorama of scenarios of neutrino masses and mixing .      1 .",
    "cosmological indications can be reconciled with the the solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits if the three standard model neutrinos have in first approximation the same mass @xmath148 2 .",
    "we emphasized that the common mass @xmath27 needed in hot+cold dm scenarios can be probed in direct searches for neutrino masses , and that this mass is only _ two times smaller _ than the masses that can be currently excluded ( eqs .",
    "( [ preferred ] ) and ( [ trit ] ) ) .",
    "the case in which the energy of the universe is dominated by three massive neutrinos can already be excluded .",

    "_ a priori _ a theoretical attractive perspective , it implies strong restrictions on certain combinations of the elements of the mixing matrix ( compare with eq .",

    "the absence of signal in reactor experiments suggests that the structure of the mixing matrix , eq .",
    "( [ matrixa ] ) , may be quite simple ( see also eq .",
    "( [ ubound ] ) and related discussion ) .",
    "regarding this point , future electron neutrino disappearance experiments will be important to better fix the parameters of the model .",
    "even better , they could permit us to distinguish the present variant of the scenario with nearly degenerate neutrinos with the variant in which the solar neutrino deficit is explained invoking the msw effect ; in fact , in this latter case _ large _ values of the mixing element @xmath89 are preferred @xcite ( compare with eq .",
    "( [ www ] ) and discussion thereafter ) .",
    "the pattern of the mixing matrix allows us to take into account the atmospheric neutrino anomaly . with accumulation of data at superkamiokande ,",
    "the zenith angle dependence of the neutrino spectrum will become a severe test of the scenario proposed .",
    "regarding the observed suppression of the solar neutrinos flux , we remarked that this model can incorporate the vacuum oscillation solution , possibly with reduced distortion of the energy spectrum .    in conclusion",
    ", we express our opinion that , even if the model proposed is not at present of particular theoretical appeal , it is of some interest since @xmath149 it incorporates cosmological and phenomenological indications ; @xmath150 it is enough restrictive to be confirmed or disproved in the future ( few ) years .",
