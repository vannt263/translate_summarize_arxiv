    "the computational power of quantum computers has threatened classical cryptosystems . for example ,",
    "public key cryptosystems , such as rivest - shamir - adleman public key cryptosystem @xcite , can be broken by quantum computers to be able to perform the fast factorization .",
    "on the other hand , quantum mechanical phenomena provide us a new kind of cryptosystems , called quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , from which we can in principle obtain perfectly random and secure key strings .",
    "the first quantum cryptographic protocol was presented by bennett and brassard @xcite and their protocol bore the acronym bb84 . in 1991 ,",
    "ekert @xcite proposed a qkd protocol using entangled particles .",
    "it was modified by bennett , brassard , and mermin @xcite .",
    "let us call the modified version the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) protocol .",
    "the epr protocol is a qkd between two persons using an epr pair of spin @xmath0 particles in the state @xmath1 .    using the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xmath2 @xcite the secret sharing protocol",
    "was presented by hillery , bu@xmath3ek and berthiaume @xcite . in this protocol",
    ", alice distributes the information on a key to bob and charlie . and",
    "the key can be restored only when their information are collected by them .    in this paper , applying the secret sharing protocol , we generalize the epr protocol on noiseless channels by the properties of several cat states @xcite and then obtain qkd protocols between group @xmath4 and group @xmath5 . in each group the information of a secret key is distributed to all members . after the process for recovery of the key",
    ", the two groups get the secret key . and the protocols require each member s approval and cooperation .",
    "furthermore , when some members try to affect the shared bit adversely , if the shared key does not have the correct correlation ( or anti - correlation ) then it should be revealed to others in the test step .",
    "any external eavesdropper should also be detected even if several members assist the eavesdropper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we investigate some properties of several cat states .",
    "the qkd protocol between two groups and its modification are presented in section 3 .",
    "we analyze the security for the protocol in section 4 .",
    "let us begin with reviewing cat states @xcite .",
    "the t - particle cat state is defined as a entangled state of the type @xmath6 whereby @xmath7 stands for the binary variable in @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ eq : cat ] ) becomes one of the bell states when @xmath10 and one of the ghz states when @xmath11 .    from now on , we use the following several cat states : @xmath12 we define @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .    for @xmath17 , we notice the states in equation ( [ cat state1 ] ) and ( [ cat state2 ] ) have the following relations : @xmath18 when @xmath19 is a group of t persons , assume that , for one of the above four cat states , each person takes its one particle and measure in the @xmath20- or @xmath21-direction .",
    "firstly we let @xmath22 be the number of members modulo 4 who measure in the @xmath21-direction , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 the sum of the measurement outcome of all members modulo 2 .",
    "then the following results are obtained .",
    "* suppose @xmath22 is even .",
    "then @xmath25 is @xmath26 for @xmath27 , and it is @xmath28 for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 ( mod 2 ) for any @xmath31 .",
    "* suppose @xmath22 is odd .",
    "then @xmath25 is @xmath26 for @xmath32 , and it is @xmath28 for @xmath33 .    also , it is noticed that if the above suppositions of @xmath22 are not satisfied , @xmath25 becomes 0 or 1 with probability @xmath0 i.e. it has no rules .    using an induction on @xmath34 the proof of such facts is given . to begin with , for @xmath35",
    "it is trivial .",
    "assume that these statements are true for @xmath36 .",
    "the cat state @xmath37 is considered .",
    "let @xmath22 be even .",
    "equation ( [ equ : decomposition ] ) implies    @xmath38    if any one member takes measurement in the @xmath20-direction and obtains 0 then @xmath39 and @xmath40 will be even , where g@xmath41 is the group of all members except that member .",
    "from equation ( [ equ : catphi ] ) @xmath42 and @xmath43 . thus @xmath44 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath45 by ( [ equ : catphi ] ) and @xmath46 .",
    "thus @xmath44 .    on the other hand , for the case",
    "that the member takes a measurement in the @xmath21-direction , the proof is similar to the above case .",
    "hence , we hold that @xmath47 . that is , the previous assumption holds for @xmath34 . for other cat states ,",
    "all of the proofs are similar .",
    "now , we consider two parties , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , that consist of @xmath48 members and @xmath49 members , respectively . applying the previously described properties of the cat states , we obtain the table [ table : exencoding ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     if @xmath50 and @xmath51 , it follows from the condition @xmath52 that the number of required test bits is not less than 270 .",
    "however , for fixed @xmath48 and @xmath49 the fewer number of test bits are required .",
    "the change of the error rate according to the number of test bits is exemplified in tables [ table : pro1,6,6 ] for the case that @xmath53 and @xmath54    the probability in the modified protocol has a little difference from the primary protocol because there are no discarded bits and @xmath55 is determined by @xmath56 and @xmath57 . by removing the strategy to use @xmath55 we can easily get the following error rates of the modified protocol .    in the case @xmath58 , @xmath59    in the case @xmath60 , @xmath61 as in the case of the first protocol",
    ", we analyze just the case @xmath60 .",
    "the error rate in equation ( [ eq : pro2ab ] ) has no connections with the values of @xmath62 and @xmath48 , and depends just on @xmath63 and @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath64 , we require only @xmath34 that satisfies @xmath65 . for @xmath66",
    ", it becomes @xmath67 . in the modified protocol",
    ", we can notice that two groups require remarkably smaller test bits than the first protocol , and furthermore errors can be detected from the test step even in the cases @xmath68 or , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , while errors can not be detected for the case in the first protocol .",
    "we remark that if just a collector can take the information on @xmath71 or only one member plays the collector for all shared bits then a fewer test bits would be required .",
    "we assume that eve intercepts @xmath49 particles travelling from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , and call this state ` the intercepted state ' .",
    "she chooses an @xmath72-particle cat state and resends @xmath49 particles of this cat state to @xmath5 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we refer to the remainder ( @xmath74)-particle state as ` the remainder state ' .    before announcement of @xmath75 ( or @xmath76 ) the measurement of the intercepted state ( or the remainder state ) can not give her the information on @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) .",
    "so she should measure on the intercepted state and the remainder state , after @xmath75 and @xmath76 are announced .",
    "even though she measures in the way , she should have the information on @xmath71 to obtain @xmath77 , since @xmath77 is completely determined by @xmath71 and @xmath75 . in order to take information on @xmath79",
    ", she needs any conspirator in @xmath4 .    on the other hand , she wants to change @xmath77 or @xmath78 into the values she desires to prevent errors from occurring .",
    "thus she needs collectors assistance in @xmath4 or @xmath5 . without any conspirators the test induces errors with probability @xmath80 in the first protocol and probability @xmath0 in the modified protocol , respectively .",
    "for these facts eve s strategy makes at least the following error rate in the first protocol .    in the case",
    "@xmath58 , @xmath81 in the case @xmath82 , @xmath83 in the modified protocol the error rates are similar to the first protocol , because eve can not have a different strategy . from these equations",
    "we can know that this strategy is not optimal to eve .",
    "applying the properties of cat states and the secret sharing @xcite , we proposed two generalized qkd protocols between two groups and showed that the protocols are secure against an external eavesdropper using the intercept / resend strategy .",
    "the importance of these protocols is that any member in the two groups can not obtain the secret key strings without cooperation , that is , the secret key strings can be obtained only under all member s approval .    *",
