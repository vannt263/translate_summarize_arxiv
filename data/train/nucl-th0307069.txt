    "concepts of effective field theory and density functional theory are at the basis of many successful nuclear structure models .",
    "quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) , in particular , presents a field theoretical framework of lorentz - covariant , meson - nucleon or point - coupling models of nuclear dynamics , that have been successfully employed in studies of a variety of nuclear phenomena  @xcite .",
    "structure models based on the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approximation of qhd have been applied to describe spherical and deformed nuclei all over the periodic table  @xcite .",
    "more recently , this relativistic framework has also been used in studies of the structure of exotic nuclei with extreme isospin and close to the particle drip lines .",
    "the effective lagrangians of qhd consist of known long - range interactions constrained by symmetries and a set of generic short - range interactions .",
    "the most successful qhd models are phenomenological , with parameters adjusted to reproduce the nuclear matter equation of state and a set of global properties of spherical closed - shell nuclei . on the other hand , the description of nuclear many - body dynamics",
    "should ultimately be constrained by the underlying theory of the strong interactions - quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it is desirable to have a more explicit connection between low - energy qcd and nuclear phenomenology .    as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the effective hadronic lagrangians of qhd and related models are consistent with the symmetries of qcd : lorentz invariance , parity invariance , electromagnetic gauge invariance , isospin and chiral symmetry .",
    "however , qhd calculations do not include pions explicitly .",
    "effects of two - pion exchange are treated implicitly through a phenomenological scalar , isoscalar mean - field . using the linear @xmath0-model lagrangian to construct a dynamical model for the @xmath1-wave @xmath2 scattering amplitude",
    ", it has been shown that the exchange of a light scalar boson can be viewed as an approximate description of the exchange of correlated @xmath1-wave pion pairs  @xcite .",
    "while qcd symmetries constrain the effective qhd lagrangians by restricting the form of possible interaction terms  @xcite , the empirical data set of bulk and single - particle properties of finite nuclei can only determine six or seven parameters in the general expansion of the effective lagrangian in powers of the fields and their derivatives  @xcite .",
    "such a general expansion is guided by the ",
    "naive dimensional analysis \" ( nda )  @xcite .",
    "nda tests the coefficients of the expansion for  naturalness \" , i.e. this method permits to control the orders of magnitude of the coupling constants .",
    "nda can exclude some interaction terms because their couplings would be  unnatural \" , but it can not determine the model parameters at the level of accuracy required for a quantitative analysis of nuclear structure data .",
    "the success of the relativistic nuclear mean - field phenomenology has been attributed to the large lorentz scalar and four - vector nucleon self - energies , which are at the basis of all qhd models  @xcite . even though the presence of large scalar and vector potentials can not be directly verified experimentally",
    ", there is strong evidence , in particular from nuclear matter saturation and spin - orbit splittings in finite nuclei , that the magnitude of each of these potentials is of the order of several hundred mev in the nuclear interior .",
    "studies based on finite - density qcd sum rules have shown how such large scalar and vector nucleon self - energies arise naturally from in - medium changes of the scalar quark condensate and the quark density  @xcite . in applications of qhd models to finite nuclei , however , the scalar and vector nucleon self - energies are treated in a purely phenomenological way . in some models they arise from the exchange of `` sigma '' and `` omega '' mesons , with adjustable strength parameters determined by the nuclear matter saturation and nuclear structure data .",
    "additional nonlinear terms , or density - dependent coupling constants adjusted to dirac - brueckner self - energies in nuclear matter , are necessary in order to obtain a satisfactory nuclear matter equation of state and to reproduce the empirical bulk properties of finite nuclei .",
    "the approach we adopt in the present work is based on the following conjectures that are believed to establish links between qcd , its symmetry breaking pattern , and the nuclear many - body problem :    * the nuclear ground state is characterized by large scalar and vector fields of approximately equal magnitude and opposite sign .",
    "these fields have their origin in the in - medium changes of the scalar quark condensate ( the chiral condensate ) and of the quark density . +",
    "* nuclear binding and saturation arise prominently from chiral ( pionic ) fluctuations ( reminiscent of van der waals forces ) in combination with pauli blocking effects , superimposed on the condensate background fields and calculated according to the rules of in - medium chiral perturbation theory .",
    "+    the first item has a direct connection with qcd sum rules at finite density .",
    "the second item is motivated by the observation that , at nuclear matter saturation density , the nucleon fermi momentum @xmath3 and the pion mass @xmath4 represent comparable scales .",
    "we therefore include pions as _ explicit _ degrees of freedom in the description of nuclear many - body dynamics .",
    "hammer and furnsthal  @xcite pointed out earlier that an effective field theory of dilute fermi systems must include pions for a proper description of the long - range physics .",
    "we support this statement by explicit calculations . while it is well known that the lowest order fock terms from pion exchange are relatively small , the primary importance of chiral dynamics in nuclear systems is manifest in two - pion exchange processes combined with pauli blocking effects which lead beyond standard mean - field approximations .",
    "the broad spectral distribution of intermediate @xmath5 pairs with @xmath6 , exchanged between nucleons , has large low - mass components starting at @xmath7 .",
    "hence their propagation in the presence of the nuclear fermi sea is _ resolved _ at the fermi momenta @xmath8 characteristic of nuclear matter .",
    "guided by such considerations the nuclear matter problem has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite within the framework of chiral effective field theory .",
    "the calculations have been performed using in - medium chiral perturbation theory to three - loop order and incorporate the one - pion exchange fock term , iterated one - pion exchange and irreducible two - pion exchange .",
    "the resulting nuclear matter equation of state is expressed as an expansion in powers of the fermi momentum @xmath3 .",
    "the expansion coefficients are functions of @xmath9 , the dimensionless ratio of the two relevant small scales .",
    "the calculation involves one single momentum space cutoff @xmath10 which encodes nn - dynamics at short distances .",
    "this cutoff scale is the only free parameter .",
    "its value can be adjusted to the energy per particle @xmath11 at saturation density . with @xmath12 gev",
    "adjusted to @xmath13 mev , the calculated equation of state gives the saturation density @xmath14@xmath15 , the compression modulus @xmath16 mev , and the asymmetry energy @xmath17mev at saturation density .",
    "the corresponding momentum- and density - dependent single - particle potential @xmath18 of nucleons in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that , at equilibrium nuclear matter density , chiral one- and two - pion exchanges generate an attractive nuclear mean - field for nucleons at the bottom of the fermi sea , with a depth of @xmath19 mev , in good agreement with the depth of the empirical optical - model potential deduced by extrapolation from elastic nucleon - nucleus scattering data , and with the average nuclear potentials employed in shell - model and mean - field calculations for finite nuclei .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have outlined an approach to the nuclear many - body problem , both for nuclear matter and finite nuclei , which emphasizes the connection with the condensate structure of the qcd ground state and pion dynamics based on spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "a relativistic point coupling model has been used , with density dependent couplings governed by scales of low - energy qcd .",
    "we have shown that chiral fluctuations play a prominent role for nuclear binding and saturation , whereas strong scalar and vector fields of equal magnitude and opposite sign , induced by changes of the qcd vacuum in the presence of baryonic matter , drive the large spin - orbit splitting in finite nuclei .",
    "the magnitude of these condensate background nucleon self - energies has been determined by the leading order in - medium qcd sum rules .    in a different implementation ,",
    "a model emphasizing the same connections to qcd symmetries and structure , was introduced and applied at the one - baryon - loop level to finite nuclei and nuclear matter in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we expand our previous studies and present a generalized and consistent version of the relativistic point - coupling model introduced in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the previous work following ref .",
    "@xcite , it was still assumed that at nuclear matter saturation density the ratio of the scalar and vector condensate potentials , arising through changes in the quark condensate and the quark density at finite baryon density , equals @xmath20 and that the nuclear binding and saturation result entirely from pionic ( chiral ) fluctuations .",
    "this approximation is relaxed in the present generalized approach and the effects of the condensate background fields at finite density are included already at the nuclear matter level .",
    "eventually we will demonstrate that with a small number of parameters , determined by the underlying microscopic dynamics , and with minor fine - tuning of higher order corrections , it is possible to describe nuclear matter , as well as properties of finite nuclei , on a level comparable to phenomenological relativistic mean - field models .    in sec .",

    "summary and conclusions are presented in sec .",
