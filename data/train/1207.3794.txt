    ", the model achieves a better fit to the detailed shape of the observed richness function than the fiducial power  law model .",
    "however , the best  fit curved richness ",
    "mass relation remains very close to a power law over the relevant mass range , and the parameter constraints shift only slightly relative to the fiducial ones .",
    "the width of the constraints grows only small amount , indicating that our assumption of a power ",
    "law relation in our fiducial analysis does not bias or overly restrict our results .",
    "we have derived cosmological constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the combination of large scale cluster  galaxy weak lensing measurements  ( s09 ) and the abundance of maxbcg clusters as a function of richness . within the analysis ,",
    "we have statistically calibrated the cluster masses by requiring consistency between the cosmological model fit and the data , exploiting external priors on the scatter in the richness ",
    "mass relation from comparisons to x - ray data  @xcite , and on the @xmath131 from galaxy clustering  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath81 confidence ellipse of our cosmological constraints on the @xmath0@xmath1 plane can be summarized as @xmath142 which is consistent with and orthogonal to the wmap7 constraints on these parameters .",
    "this consistency of structure measured in the recombination era and the low redshift universe provides further evidence for the gravitational growth predicted by the @xmath143 model combining gr , a cosmological constant , and cold dark matter . assuming this model to be correct and combining our analysis with wmap7",
    ", we obtain individual constraints as @xmath144 the overall results are consistent with and complementary to two other cosmological constraints from the same underlying clusters but with different input data and systematic uncertainties  ( r10 and tinker12 ) .",
    "collectively these three studies demonstrate consistency of the small scale weak lensing , large scale weak lensing , galaxy content , and abundance of the maxbcg sample , together with galaxy clustering data .",
    "the primary systematic uncertainties in our analysis are the scatter in the cluster richness ",
    "mass relation and residual bias in the weak lensing measurements associated with photometric redshifts or shear calibration .",
    "however , with the external priors we have adopted , neither of these systematics is a limiting factor in our analysis ; the uncertainties in our cosmological constraints are dominated by statistical uncertainties in the large scale @xmath23 measurements .",
    "these statistical errors can be sharply reduced in future surveys with deeper imaging and better seeing .",
    "statistical improvements will require corresponding improvements in the control of systematics .",
    "while we have focused in this paper on large scales to complement the r10 analysis , the long term goal should be to derive constraints from the full range of @xmath23 simultaneously .",
    "achieving this goal will require theoretical and numerical work to construct models that are accurate across the 1-halo and 2-halo transition and to assess uncertainties in the accuracy of the model predictions at all scales .",
    "there are opportunities for significant near ",
    "term improvements in our analysis using sdss data .",
    "the maxbcg catalog and weak lensing measurements used here are based on imaging data from dr4 . with the recent release of dr8  @xcite ,",
    "almost every aspect of the catalog construction and the weak lensing measurements has evolved .",
    "the increase in the imaging area will enhance the raw statistical power  ( for @xmath145 deg@xmath51 vs. @xmath146 deg@xmath51 ) , reducing poisson uncertainties and sample variance in the cluster counts and shape noise in the @xmath23 measurements .",
    "the optical cluster finding algorithm has been improved to produce catalogs with well - controlled selection function and , more importantly , a new richness estimator with reduced intrinsic scatter .",
    "@xcite considered various modifications of the original richness estimator in maxbcg and found that the scatter in log  mass at fixed richness could be reduce to @xmath147 depending on richness , substantially smaller than maxbcg scatter  ( @xmath148 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that we adopted as a prior in our analysis . when the scatter itself is smaller , then the systematic uncertainty tied to uncertainty in the scatter is also smaller .",
    "with improved uncertainty of the selection function , it will be feasible to use higher redshift clusters in the analysis , and while the @xmath23 measurements will degrade at higher @xmath149 because of reduced source surface density , the leverage of a wider redshift range may strengthen the cosmological constraints . on the weak lensing side ,",
    "the main improvement is a better understanding of the photometric redshift distribution of source galaxies . with a much improved spectroscopic training set and better photometric calibration , @xcite reconstructed a redshift distribution for dr8 imaging data that is primarily limited by sample variance .",
    "additional improvements come from updates in the photometric pipeline , including better sky subtraction , more refined stellar masks , and better psf corrections in the shape measurements .    beyond sdss",
    ", our approach can be applied to future , deeper , large  area imaging surveys . in the near term , the pan ",
    "starrs1  ( ps1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath150 survey is expected to have larger area than sdss , slightly greater depth , and higher image quality that yields a significant increase of the source density for weak lensing .",
    "the dark energy survey  ( des ; * ? ? ? * ) , expected to start in late 2012 , plans to survey @xmath151 deg@xmath51 to a depth two magnitudes beyond sdss , with a weak lensing source density a factor of ten higher .",
    "it is designed with cluster cosmology and weak lensing as central goals , and our technique is naturally adapted to it . in the longer term , the imaging data sets from lsst , and the euclid and wfirst missions will allow radical improvements in the precision of cluster  galaxy lensing analysis , with effective source densities of @xmath152 arcmin@xmath153 .",
    "these imaging surveys can provide their own cluster catalogs identified from the galaxy population , and they can provide stacked weak lensing measurements for clusters identified via x - ray emission or the sz effect .",
    "comparisons of results from different classes of cluster catalogs allow powerful cross ",
    "checks for systematics  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and des will target the area covered by the sz survey of the south pole telescope .",
    "x - ray observables may be more tightly correlated with halo mass than optical observables , and the upcoming erosita mission will carry out a sensitive all  sky x - ray survey that will revolutionize cosmological studies with x - ray selected clusters .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that cluster abundances with masses calibrated by stacked weak lensing can provide constraints on structure growth that are highly competitive with those from cosmic shear analysis of the same wl survey .",
    "this conclusion assumes @xmath23 measurements out to @xmath154 cluster virial radii , so the larger scale analysis illustrated here can only strengthen the power of this approach .",
    "cluster - galaxy lensing is analogous to galaxy - galaxy lensing , but the relation between clusters and halos is simpler than the relation between galaxies and halos , and it is less subject to the complexities of baryonic physics .",
    "this greater simplicity reduces systematic uncertainty associated with theoretical modeling , which may ultimately compensate for the rarity of clusters relative to galaxies ( and consequent lower statistical precision of the wl measurements ) .",
    "the tinker12 study shows that the constraining power of small scale measurements can be enhanced by bringing in additional information from galaxy clustering and cluster mass - to - number ratios . in future work",
    ", we will investigate the generalization of this idea to large scales using the cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function , which can be measured in projection from the same survey used for weak lensing analysis .",
    "nature has provided observable signposts that mark the locations of the most massive halos in the universe , and stacked weak lensing provides a tool to measure the average mass profiles of these halos at high precision over a wide range of scales . exploiting this combination promises to yield stringent tests of gravity on cosmological scales and of theories for the origin of cosmic acceleration .",
