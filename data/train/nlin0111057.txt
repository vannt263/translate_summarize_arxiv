    "deterministic diffusion plays an important rle in a variety of physical phenomena and applications , e.g. particle confinement in magnetic fields @xcite , conductivity in metals @xcite , etc .",
    "a general theory of diffusion for systems with continuous time is presented in @xcite . in systems with periodic phase - space structure , diffusion may be induced by chaotic dynamics inside the elementary cells , causing an irregular jumping between the cells .",
    "the investigation of deterministic diffusion is an interesting task both from the theoretical point of view , concerning the question of how the typical stochastic properties arise from a purely deterministic dynamics , as well as with regard to its various applications in different physical contexts .",
    "it has been observed that even the simplest model systems  one - dimensional maps  which exhibit deterministic diffusion are capable of explaining the behaviour of relevant physical systems @xcite . for such maps , it has been demonstrated that the diffusive properties are related to the periodic orbits of the map restricted to an elementary cell @xcite . in particular , the diffusion constant characterizing the diffusive spreading can be obtained from the leading zero of a zeta function consisting of a product over contributions from all periodic orbits of the reduced map .",
    "similar to the dynamical zeta functions which appear in semiclassical quantization problems , this product usually does not converge . in former work",
    "@xcite , the convergence problem was handled by the application of cycle expansion techniques . however , cycle expansion strongly depends on the existence of a symbolic dynamics and the shadowing of long orbits by combinations of short ones .    on the other hand ,",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that the convergence problems of the zeta functions and corresponding response functions arising in semiclassical quantization problems can be circumvented by the application of harmonic inversion , which is a universal method in the sense that it does not rely on a symbolic code or other special properties of the system .",
    "the method has recently been extended from hamiltonian systems to maps @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that harmonic inversion can also be used for the calculation of diffusion constants of one - dimensional maps . in analogy with the procedure for semiclassical quantization , we rewrite the zeta function as a response function , from which we construct a periodic orbit signal including a finite set of periodic orbits .",
    "the analysis of the signal by harmonic inversion yields the zeros of the underlying zeta function , from which the diffusion constant is calculated .",
    "we apply this technique to an example map for which the periodic orbits can easily be calculated , and which has already been examined with the help of cycle expansion techniques @xcite , rendering a comparison with previous results possible .",
    "we start by describing the general procedure .",
    "we consider one - dimensional maps @xmath0 defined by an anti - symmetric function @xmath1 , @xmath2 for points",
    "@xmath3 inside the elementary cell @xmath4 , and a discrete translational symmetry outside the elementary cell , @xmath5 from this map , a reduced map @xmath6 can be constructed by restricting the dynamics to the elementary cell via the definition @xmath7 \\label{x^x } \\\\",
    "f(x )   & = &   \\hat f(x)- [ \\hat f(x)+1/2]\\ ; , \\label{fx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 $ ] denotes the integer part of the quantity in the brackets .",
    "each periodic orbit of the reduced map @xmath9 , consisting of a sequence of fixed points @xmath10 , corresponds to an orbit of the full map @xmath11 which returns to an equivalent point , @xmath12 the diffusion constant associated with the map is determined by the lattice translation @xmath13 after @xmath14 applications of the map , averaged over initial conditions in the elementary cell @xmath15 as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for hyperbolic or almost hyperbolic maps , the diffusion constant can be determined from the periodic orbits of the reduced map ( [ fx ] ) by considering the zeta function @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the topological length and the stability of the orbit , respectively , @xmath18 denotes the lattice translation of the corresponding orbit of the full map , and @xmath19 is a free parameter . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the diffusion constant @xmath20 can be expressed in terms of the leading zero @xmath21 of the zeta function as a function of @xmath19 , @xmath22_{\\beta=0}\\ ; .\\ ] ] additionally , from the symmetry of the map , it follows that @xmath23_{\\beta = 0}=0 $ ] .",
    "using these relations , an expansion of @xmath24 for small @xmath19 yields @xmath25 which can directly be used to calculate the diffusion constant from the leading zero for small @xmath19 .",
    "the problem that remains is how to actually calculate the leading zero , since the expression ( [ zeta_func ] ) for the zeta function usually diverges . in past works ,",
    "this problem has been tackled by application of cycle expansion techniques . as an alternative",
    ", we demonstrate in the following how the zeta function can be expressed in terms of a response function , and how the leading zero can then be obtained by harmonic inversion of a periodic orbit signal constructed from this response function .",
    "we start by defining the quantity @xmath26 and rewriting the zeta function ( [ zeta_func ] ) as a function of @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) can be written in the form @xmath29 where the response function @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 with @xmath32 a smooth , slowly varying function of @xmath27 . using the definition @xmath33 where the first sum in ( [ g3 ] ) now runs over _ all _ periodic orbits ( p.o . ) including multiple traversals of primitive orbits , and @xmath34 denotes the topological length of the underlying primitive orbit .",
    "after carrying out the sum over @xmath35 , the response function finally reads @xmath36 on the other hand , the response function can be written in terms of the zeros @xmath37 of the zeta function ( [ zeta_func2 ] ) and their multiplicities @xmath38 , @xmath39 like the zeta function ( [ zeta_func2 ] ) , the expression ( [ gpo ] ) for the response function will usually not converge in those regions of the complex variable @xmath27 , where the poles of @xmath30 are located , and the zeros of the zeta function can not directly be calculated from ( [ gpo ] ) . instead",
    ", we apply harmonic inversion to obtain an analytical continuation @xcite .",
    "the poles @xmath40 of the analytical continuation of @xmath30 in ( [ gpo ] ) are the zeros of the analytical continuation of the zeta function @xmath41 in ( [ zeta_func2 ] ) .",
    "to apply harmonic inversion , we now construct a periodic orbit signal by fourier transformation of the response function ( [ gpo ] ) , @xmath42 considering only the second , oscillating part of @xmath30 , this results in @xmath43 the corresponding signal resulting from fourier transformation of eq .",
    "( [ gex ] ) reads @xmath44 which contains the zeros @xmath40 of the zeta function ( [ zeta_func2 ] ) as frequencies .",
    "the zeros @xmath40 can now be determined by adjusting the periodic orbit signal ( [ cpo ] )  including all orbits up to a maximum topological length @xmath45  to the form of the corresponding signal ( [ cex ] ) by harmonic inversion . according to eq .",
    "( [ d - z ] ) and with the relation @xmath46 , the diffusion constant can be obtained from the leading frequency @xmath47 using the relation @xmath48 which for small @xmath19 should be independent of @xmath19 .",
    "as an example we consider the following map , which has also been examined in ref .",
    "@xcite : for points @xmath3 inside the interval @xmath49 $ ] the map is defined by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a free parameter with the restriction @xmath52 . outside the elementary cell ,",
    "the map is continued according to eq .",
    "( [ ^f^x ] ) . using eqs .",
    "( [ x^x ] ) and ( [ fx ] ) , a corresponding reduced map @xmath9 can be constructed .    as was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the periodic orbits of the reduced map @xmath9 can be described by a complete symbolic dynamics with a three - letter alphabet .",
    "for @xmath53 the dynamics is completely hyperbolic .",
    "the 0 orbit ( corresponding to the fixed point @xmath54 ) is infinitely unstable ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) and does not contribute to the response function ( [ gpo ] ) . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the 0 orbit becomes marginally stable with @xmath57 , and the dynamics becomes intermittent .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that at @xmath58 the system undergoes a phase transition from normal to anomalous diffusion , and the diffusion constant as defined by eq .",
    "( [ defd ] ) equals 0 for @xmath59 .    for @xmath56",
    ", the marginally stable 0 orbit would give a diverging contribution to the zeta function ( [ zeta_func ] ) as well as to the periodic orbit signal ( [ cpo ] ) . as was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is appropriate to simply omit this orbit from the zeta function , as was also done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the diffusion constant of the map ( [ map ] ) as a function of @xmath51 was determined using explicit cycle expansion expressions for the average in eq .",
    "( [ defd ] ) rather than making use of eq .",
    "( [ d2z ] ) . in the following",
    ", we will determine the diffusion constant by harmonic inversion as outlined above .",
    "we calculated the diffusion constant for different values of the parameter @xmath51 in the region @xmath60 using the periodic orbits up to topological length @xmath61 ( but omitting the 0 orbit ) . for each value of @xmath51 , we performed calculations for different small values of @xmath19 and checked the convergence of the results for the diffusion constant for @xmath62 .",
    "the results for the diffusion constant are presented in figure [ fig1 ] . in the region @xmath63 ,",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with those from ref .",
    "@xcite obtained with the periodic orbits up to topological length @xmath64 . for @xmath65 , the different techniques applied in ref .",
    "@xcite yielded quantitatively different values for the diffusion constant ; here , our results show a good qualitative agreement with the different cycle expansion results .",
    "this is even true when we used the reduced set of orbits up to topological length @xmath64 in our calculations : the function @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] becomes slightly more flat , but still shows a good qualitative agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", it was not possible to reproduce the theoretical value @xmath67 for @xmath59 , but one only obtains an asymptotical convergence to this value .    in our calculations , we observed that the condition that for given @xmath51 the expression ( [ d - w0 ] ) for the diffusion constant should become independent of @xmath19 for @xmath62 was well fulfilled for @xmath68 .",
    "however , with increasing @xmath69 , the results became numerically unstable if @xmath19 was too close to zero , so that we had to extrapolate from the results for @xmath19 around @xmath70 .",
    "the convergence of the frequencies and amplitudes in the harmonic inversion procedure itself was also very good for @xmath68 , but convergence was increasingly hard to obtain for @xmath69 .",
    "a criterion for the reliability of the results for a given value of @xmath51 is the closeness of the leading frequency for @xmath71 to its theoretical value @xmath72 , as well as the closeness of the corresponding amplitude @xmath73 ( see eq .",
    "( [ cex ] ) ) obtained by harmonic inversion to its theoretical value 1 ( the multiplicity of the leading zero of the zeta function ) .",
    "the absolute value of the leading frequency for @xmath71 and the corresponding amplitude as a function of @xmath51 are presented in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the absolute value of the leading frequency was smallest for @xmath68 but stayed below @xmath74 for all values of @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding amplitudes were nearly exactly equal to their theoretical value 1 for @xmath68 , but began to deviate from their theoretical value for @xmath75 , indicating that the harmonic inversion results became less well converged .",
    "a possible reason for the deviations may be that the density of frequencies becomes too large for the signal length chosen .",
    "it can be expected that the accuracy of the results will be improved by including longer orbits .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed to truncate the periodic orbit sum by introducing a stability cutoff and to use the stability as an ordering parameter for the cycle expansion .",
    "it is worth noting that the harmonic inversion procedure has the advantage that no discrete ordering parameter is needed at all .",
    "however , a stability cutoff can also be used with the harmonic inversion technique because very unstable orbits give only a small contribution to the signal which can be neglected .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated how the diffusion constant of one - dimensional diffusive maps can be determined from a finite set of periodic orbits using harmonic inversion techniques .",
    "starting from a zeta function whose leading zero possesses a known relation to the diffusion constant , we have constructed a periodic orbit signal which was analysed by harmonic inversion . the diffusion constant",
    "could then be determined from the leading frequency of the signal .",
    "since , in contrast to other methods such as cycle expansion , harmonic inversion does not depend on any special properties of the map , the general procedure should work in the same way for all chaotic maps .",
    "we have tested the method for a simple map whose periodic orbits can easily be determined and for which results for the diffusion constant obtained by cycle expansion techniques are available in the literature .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with the ones from cycle expansion .",
