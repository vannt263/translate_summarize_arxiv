    "supertube is a tubular d2-brane that preserves 1/4 of supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "this requires presence of d0 and fundamental string charge , both realized as electromagnetic field on the d2 worldvolume .",
    "alternatively , it may be considered as blow - up of f1-d0 composites obtained via angular momentum .",
    "one unusual characteristic of supertube is that , as classical solution , they come with huge degeneracy and can take many different form @xcite . for instance , the cross section of a supertube need not be circular and in fact can even be noncompact @xcite .",
    "the simplest of such supertubes involves a cylinder of d2 with uniform magnetic field @xmath6 and uniform electric field @xmath7 directed along the length of the cylinder @xcite .",
    "let us consider the field strength of type , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radius of the cylinder while @xmath10 is of period @xmath11",
    ". with born - infeld action , the physical electric flux , along @xmath12 direction and per unit @xmath10 , is @xmath13 and the energy density per unit @xmath12 and unit @xmath10 is @xmath14 note that the total electric flux is @xmath15 while the net magnetic flux per unit @xmath12 is @xmath16 .",
    "this configuration is known to become 1/4 supersymmetric when the electric field @xmath7 is taken to the critical value @xmath0 . upon this",
    ", we have an inverse relationship between magnetic field and flux density , @xmath17 and the energy density decomposes into two pieces nicely @xmath18 in this last expression , the first term represents the energy of fundamental strings and the second represents d0 energy .",
    "tension of d2 itself disappeared completely .",
    "one aspect of this state particularly relevant for this note is that one can reduce size of the supertube without affecting the fundamental string charge .",
    "let us fix the total electric flux @xmath19 and take the small radius limit , where the energy per unit length becomes @xmath20 so as we decrease amount of magnetic flux on d2 , the cylindrical configuration collapses to infinitesimal tubular configuration which entirely consists of the fundamental string charge .",
    "it was recently suggested that in the system of unstable d@xmath21-brane decay , fundamental string may be realized as a limiting configuration of tubular d@xmath22-branes with electric flux on it  @xcite .",
    "question of fundamental strings remains one of more puzzling aspect in the study of unstable d - brane decay @xcite , and very recently possible roles of topological defects in this question began to be addressed @xcite .",
    "approaching it from low energy dynamics , several nontrivial interaction between topological defects were isolated , and it was found that tachyonic kink configurations tend to attract nearby and parallel electric flux lines @xcite forming a bound state of d@xmath22 brane and fundamental strings .",
    "the idea is to curl up such a bound state into a cylindrical configuration with only one noncompact direction and let the compact part shrink away to zero size .",
    "specific form of such tubular solution was obtained from lifting @xcite the callan - maldacena solution of d@xmath22 brane  @xcite to that of tachyon effective action on unstable d@xmath21-brane and concentrating on the spike part of the configuration .",
    "such a combination involves vanishing radius of the tube , which makes it fairly singular . in this note , we consider the case of unstable d3 brane and consider a family of solutions representing supertube .",
    "these may be regarded as a thickened version of such tubular fundamental string charge carrier and may be used as regulated and stabilized solution .",
    "the d@xmath22 branes are also typically represented by infinitesimally thin domain wall solutions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , smooth kink solutions are known and , in the theory of tachyon , are represented by an infinite array of kinks and anti - kinks to be interpreted as d - brane - anti-@xmath23-brane pairs  @xcite .",
    "when the tachyon couples to born - infeld gauge field , spectra of regular extended objects become rich  @xcite . some of these smooth solutions are interpreted as thickened d - branes or bound states of d - brane and f1 .",
    "topological kink solution with orthogonal and uniform critical electric flux appears to enjoy bps properties . for infinite array of kinks - anti - kinks and a topological kink with orthogonal and uniform electric flux ,",
    "exact boundary states were also found  @xcite .",
    "naturally , this prompts us to ask whether there exists a regulated and thickened version of supertube - like solutions , which of course should reproduce genuine supertube configurations in the zero thickness limit .",
    "section 2 will introduce the setup and solve for supertube - like configuration with `` critical '' electric field . with a specific choice of potential , we find an analytic and smooth solutions of coaxial array of tubes with d0 and fundamental string charge .",
    "surprisingly , this family of solutions seemingly saturate a bps - like energy formula , and behave much like supertubes , except the d2 worldvolume is thickened .",
    "taking an infinitesimally thin limit of this solution , we find singular supertube solutions of arbitrary radius which match up with expected properties of supertubes precisely .",
    "we close the section with brief comments on relevance of these solutions in the context of fundamental string formation .",
    "section 3 addresses the question of turning on more electric fields and point out that boosting the tubular solution lengthwise will tilt the flux such that fundamental string appears winding helically along the tube .",
    "section 4 considers a different class of ansatz involving dirac monopole in gauge sector .",
    "we show that the only static solution of such kind involves strict vacuum @xmath24 so that the monopole - like configuration can not lead to any physical effect .",
    "the appendix explores supertube ansatz with noncritical @xmath25 case .",
    "we close with summary .",
    "we begin this section with introducing effective tachyon action for unstable d3-brane  @xcite @xmath26 this sort of behavior with potential multiplying the kinetic term seems generic and in particular predicted by boundary string field theory approach @xcite . for most of this note",
    ", we will adopt a convenient form of @xmath27  @xcite , which has been derived from open string theory  @xcite recently , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is @xmath30 for the non - bps d - brane in the superstring and 2 for the bosonic string , in the string unit .",
    "we are interested in tubular configurations embedded in flat d3-brane , and will work in the cylindrical coordinate system , @xmath31 both the tachyon field and the electromagnetic fields are assumed to depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath32 , and we employ ansatz for the electromagnetic fields consistent with supertube solution @xmath33 with the assumption of time independence , behavior of @xmath34 and @xmath35 is determined entirely by the bianchi identity , which gives @xmath36 with constant @xmath7 and @xmath37 . at origin . ]",
    "since we have @xmath38 ( 1 + { t'}^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the low energy effective action simplifies drastically @xmath39 where the prime @xmath40 denotes differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath32 .",
    "since we are primarily concerned with supertube - like solutions , we may as well take @xmath0 for start and work with the action @xmath41 we will come back in later part of the note for more general solution . then the effective action above maps to that of a simple mechanical system with conserved `` energy '' by imagining @xmath32 as `` time '' , which immediately gives us the following integral of motion , @xmath42 where we introduced an arbitrary integration constant @xmath43 .",
    "equivalently this integral of motion can be obtained from the energy - momentum conservation of the full action .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath44 with @xmath45^{2}.\\ ] ] note that , in the limit of vanishing magnetic field @xmath46 , the equation becomes @xmath47 and it allows only trivial vacuum solution @xmath48 .    a nontrivial solution exists for @xmath49 and is a coaxial array of tubular configuration where @xmath50 oscillates as function of @xmath32 . for instance , under the specific form of tachyon potential ( [ v3 ] )",
    ", we have an exact solution @xmath51.\\ ] ] note that this represents a coaxial array of tubular d2 and anti - d2 since the solution involves kink and anti - kink pair along every @xmath52 @xcite . for the moment",
    ", we shall impose regularity of @xmath50 field at origin by requiring @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an integer .",
    "note that the periodicity of the solution , @xmath55 , is independent of the value of @xmath56 .",
    "this is a consequence of the particular form of the potential ( [ v3 ] ) we adopted .    for the obtained tubular objects ,",
    "the following physical momenta vanish , @xmath57 and all off - diagonal components of stress - tensor vanish as would be expected of a stationary solution .",
    "all nonvanishing conserved densities are dictated by a single quantity @xmath58 which , for the particular form of the potential ( [ v3 ] ) , has an explicit expression @xmath59^{-1}+\\cos^{2}(r / t_{0})}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] the energy and the electric flux in infinitesimal @xmath60 are written as @xmath61 per unit length along @xmath12 .",
    "for these quantities , we can see that the period along @xmath32 is actually half of that of @xmath62 .",
    "this can be understood by realizing that solution represents a coaxial array of tubular d2 and anti - d2 branes with worldvolume gauge fields turned on . while a single isolated d2 in vacuum is given by singular kink , it is also known that modification of boundary condition may thicken the kink into a smooth thickened solution @xcite .",
    "each period of @xmath50 contains a pair of tubular domain wall and anti - domain wall , while the above conserved quantities are insensitive on orientation of the wall .",
    "distinction between d2 and anti - d2 can be seen from gradient of @xmath50 which generates rr charge of d2 branes @xcite .    in order to identify the obtained tubular objects in each half period @xmath63",
    ", we compute the energy ( tube tension ) per unit tube length @xmath64 \\cos^2 ( r / t_0)},\\ ] ] and string charge per unit length @xmath65 \\cos^2 ( r / t_0)}.\\ ] ] in addition , each unit tube ( or antitube ) carries angular momentum per unit length @xmath66 \\cos^2 ( r / t_0)}.\\ ] ] a salient point is that the difference @xmath67 is quite simple and can be identified as d0-brane charge . in terms of formulae",
    "above , we define @xmath68 as @xmath69 for the specific form of the tachyon potential ( [ v3 ] ) , it coincides exactly with the d0-brane charge before introducing tachyon profile @xmath70 \\cos^2 ( r / t_0 ) } = 2\\pi^{2 } \\alpha t_0 { \\cal t}_3 , \\ ] ] regardless of value of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , much like the case of supertube we introduced earlier , the tension of unit tachyon tube ( or antitube ) system decomposes linearly into two additive pieces .",
    "furthermore @xmath71 , as the notation suggests , happens to be the energy density expected of d0-branes . to see this , we need to note that @xmath72 is the quantity that becomes tension of the d2-brane in this low energy theory . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath73 is the net magnetic flux on the d2 per unit @xmath12 length .",
    "product of the two generates d0 charge in spacetime @xcite .    however , we must caution the reader against taking this fact too seriously . most likely , this miracle happened only because of the particular form of the potential ( [ v3 ] ) adopted above , which is justified only in certain limit @xcite",
    ". a priori , there seems to be no rationale why the integral that defines @xmath74 ( [ qd ] ) must be independent of @xmath43 , for more general form of potential .",
    "dependence on @xmath43 will result in an anomalous dependence on the electric flux density and ruin the bps - like energy formula .",
    "in such general case , one must take the limit of infinitesimal thickness of the domain wall to find such a simple behavior , which is the subject of next part .",
    "nevertheless , as long as we are working with such a particular potential , this gives an interesting option for handling supertube - like configurations .",
    "when we take a limit of @xmath75 , the configuration gets squeezed near @xmath76 for each positive integer @xmath77 . every localized piece becomes sharply peaked at each site of the tachyon tube ( or antitube ) so that @xmath78 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "this singular form of solution also implies that value of @xmath50 lies at @xmath79 away from these centers , and neither the value of @xmath80 nor @xmath6 enters the dynamics directly except for discrete positions of tube ( antitube ) . in such limit , we have no reason whatsoever to insist upon regularity at the origin .",
    "we thus have more general _ singular _ solution such that @xmath81 without loss of generality we may consider values of @xmath82 such that @xmath83 . correspondingly , we have @xmath84 \\times\\pi{\\cal t}_3 t_0 , \\label{t2n}\\\\ q_{{\\rm f1}}^{(n ) } & = & \\frac{2\\pi } { \\alpha}\\left((n - 1/2)\\pi t_0-r_0\\right)^2\\times\\pi{\\cal t}_3 t_0,\\label{qn}\\\\ q_{{\\rm d0}}^{(n ) } & = & { 2\\pi\\alpha}\\times\\pi{\\cal t}_3 t_0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the accompanying angular momenta , @xmath85 though distribution of the d0 charge and its magnetic field profile are singular , induced energy contribution is finite as shown in eq .",
    "( [ t2n ] ) .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ ld0 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ qn ] ) satisfy the relation between radial size of @xmath77-th tube @xmath86 and charges such as @xmath87 .",
    "different choice of the tachyon potential will modify the universal function @xmath88 , but the limiting form will again involve delta - functions . for the following discussion we will consider more general form of the potential , and retains the requirement that the potential decays exponentially @xmath89 asymptotically .",
    "other requirements are that @xmath27 is monotonically decreasing in @xmath90 and that @xmath91 .",
    "for convenience , take a half period of @xmath62 that solves @xmath92 @xmath93 then starts out with value zero and begins to increase slowly as long as @xmath27 value remains exponentially small in @xmath50 .",
    "conversely when @xmath80 remains small @xmath27 value must remain small also .",
    "let us take any of one of half period such that @xmath62 starts at large negative value @xmath94 , where @xmath95 for the rest of discussion .",
    "so the half period is determined by the integral @xmath96 at some points near the middle of this half period , @xmath50 begins to approach @xmath97 where @xmath98 now refers to characteristic scale where @xmath27 is of order 1 . in this region",
    "@xmath93 is very large , achieving a maximum value at @xmath99 such that @xmath100 .",
    "this means that the interval in @xmath32 where @xmath50 is comparable to @xmath98 is very short .",
    "recall that the function @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 we wish to approximate this expression by @xmath103 for monotonic and increasing @xmath62 . of course this is possible only if @xmath80 is very large . in the region where @xmath80 is of order one ,",
    "the equation for @xmath50 above tells us that we also must have , @xmath104 meaning that @xmath27 is still of order @xmath43 .",
    "since we are taking the limit of @xmath75 , this allows us to use the approximate formula @xmath105 in place of @xmath101 . within this half period , assuming that the latter is finite , @xmath88 reduces to @xmath106 we have used the fact that the support of @xmath101 , more precisely the region of @xmath32 where @xmath101 remains larger than , say , @xmath107 vanishes rapidly as @xmath107 when we take @xmath108 .",
    "the quantity in the parenthesis is to be identified with ordinary bps d2-brane tension @xmath109 @xcite . with this , d0 charge and f1 charge are respectively , @xmath110 and the energy is the sum of the two @xmath111 in order to compare this to ordinary supertube , we need to restore the factor of d2-brane tension , @xmath109 , in energy formulae of section 1 and identify @xmath37 with @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the supertube can be understood as that in singular zero - thickness limit of the obtained unit tachyon tube ( or antitube ) solution .",
    "the whole configuration we obtained is interpreted as coaxial array of tube - antitube .",
    "once we take @xmath113 limit , on the other hand , each and every tube becomes a complete solution on its own .",
    "as we saw earlier in this note , supertube provides an interesting method of blowing up a long fundamental string .",
    "while this is not much of advantage in ordinary supersymmetric string theory context , it may prove more useful when we consider how fundamental string forms from decay of unstable d - branes .",
    "one of more intriguing scenarios that emerged recently involve string flux sitting at top of tachyon potential . however , no such stable solution exists and one must take a double scaling limit of cylindrical domain wall to reach such a state .",
    "that is , take an infinitely thin domain wall with fluxes on it and then take infinitesimal radius limit of a cylinder thereof .",
    "the string flux is imagined to be embedded in this infinitesimal cylinder .",
    "because of such a double scaling limit , the object is a bit difficult to handle .    a priori , it is not obvious whether , in the absence of d@xmath22 branes nearby , there is really any tangible difference between such configurations and a tight collection of string fluid @xcite sitting at some homogeneous vacuum .",
    "as was point out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamics of the two will follow exactly the same , nambu - goto - like , equation of motion @xcite away from d@xmath22 brane .",
    "one motivation for the current work is to provide a setting where more precise question about such stringy configurations can be asked .    by adding magnetic field to the tubular configuration",
    ", we essentially obviated one of the two scalings , and found a stable string - like configuration of small but finite tubular radius .",
    "magnetic field strength necessary scales with the radius of the tube , so one can take smaller and smaller size tube by taking small magnetic field limit . for specific form of the potential ,",
    "furthermore , the unit tachyon tube before taking thin supertube limit provides additional control , given that it also satisfies a bps - type relation ( [ ld0 ] ) and is given by exact and smooth solution ( [ tub ] ) .",
    "existence of such a static and smooth profile in closed form may come in handy , at least for the purpose of having a set of solutions that approaches infinitesimally small tubular solution . while the d0 charge remains unchanged for the particular form of the potential .",
    "what remains unchanged is that the energy gets contribution from that of fundamental strings and d0 s only . ]",
    "while we concentrated on cylinders with circular cross section , it is well known that a supertube can be deformed to have an arbitrary cross section @xcite . in the present context , this results in huge degeneracy which gives at best arbitrarily shaped distribution of fundamental string charges , much as in the case of string fluid in real vacuum .",
    "as was also pointed out previously , therefore , this alternate picture of fundamental string is so far unable to resolve the usual degeneracy problem @xcite , or equivalently the lack of confinement mechanism , at the level of classical effective theory .",
    "it remains to be seen how and at what level this degeneracy is lifted @xcite .",
    "one might ask whether more general ansatz leads to new kind of tubular solutions .",
    "one of more obvious variation we can try is to turn on more electromagnetic field .",
    "in fact there is a simple generalization of the ansatz that brings us back to an equally simple integrable equation for @xmath50 .",
    "consider turning on @xmath114 in addition to @xmath34 @xmath115 with static field strength of @xmath32 dependence alone , bianchi identity demands that both @xmath116 and @xmath34 are constants",
    ".    note that @xmath117 will generate fundamental string charge along angular direction in addition to the one along @xmath12 direction , so the electric flux will have a helical shape along the tube .",
    "more precisely , the electric flux along @xmath12 and @xmath10 directions has a relation @xmath118 where we define @xmath119 , and @xmath120 in @xmath121 gauge .",
    "the effective action for the tachyon field @xmath122 becomes @xmath123 as before , this becomes integrable once we impose the condition of critical electric field , @xmath124 , since the lagrangian will then have no explicit @xmath32-dependence .",
    "furthermore it is easy to show that , within cylindrical symmetry ansatz , this is the only case where simple first order integral of motion is possible .",
    "in fact , the form of the action is identical to the case with @xmath125 above if we identify @xmath126 note in particular that sensible solution will appear only if @xmath127 .",
    "one can understand this by realizing that the two cases are in fact related by a lorentz boost along @xmath12 direction .",
    "starting with the simplest case , @xmath128 one may boost this field strength along @xmath12 with velocity @xmath129 , @xmath130",
    "we then may identify @xmath131 which also gives eq .",
    "( [ alp ] ) completing the assertion that turning on @xmath114 is equivalent to boosting and appropriate rescaling of @xmath6 .",
    "of course @xmath50 is a scalar field and so @xmath80 is also invariant under the lorentz boost along @xmath12 direction .",
    "emergence of winding electric flux on d2 , or equivalently winding fundamental string charge , upon a boost may be surprising .",
    "after all , the same will happen even if the d2-brane were wound on a topological circle , which seems to say that boosting generated net conserved string charge along the topological circle direction .",
    "this unexpected effect may be understood once we realize that worldvolume magnetic field also couples ns - ns field @xmath132 . although it does not generate net string charge ,",
    "the worldvolume magnetic field generates a spacelike current associated with string charge .",
    "all that happen is that the lorentz boost tilts this spacelike current toward time direction a bit , which effectively generates density of string charge .",
    "with a minimal assumption on nontrivial field content , the effective action was shown above to be of the form , @xmath133 with @xmath134 for the supertube case with constant @xmath135 .",
    "reality of the born - infeld action requires , @xmath136 , since otherwise the action will become purely imaginary at asymptotic region .",
    "this sort of effective action can be used to explore another kind of configuration , namely a spherically symmetry magnetic monopole .",
    "the latter should have @xmath137 which gives an effective action of the above form with @xmath138 of course @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ mpl ] ) is the radial coordinate of spherical coordinate system .    unlike the case of maxwell theory",
    ", the singularity of this dirac monopole does not cost infinite amount of energy , and one might wonder if there exist a dirac monopole - like solution of finite mass .",
    "existence of such a solution is unlikely , given that no obvious stringy interpretation is available . here",
    "we will confirm this expectation by showing that the above class of action does not possess a regular and isolated solution that approaches vacuum at large radius .",
    "if there is an isolated solution with such charges , @xmath62 must approach @xmath79 at large @xmath32 . since the system is invariant under @xmath139 , take positive infinity for the asymptotic value of @xmath50 .",
    "far away from origin , then , the potential @xmath140 approaches @xmath141 exponentially fast , and we could ask whether there is a proper solution with @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "euler - lagrange equation of motion reduces to @xmath144 where we used @xmath145 .",
    "defining @xmath146 as @xmath147 the equation of motion ( [ ele ] ) is now @xmath148 because of the relative positive sign , this first order equation always drives @xmath146 toward @xmath149 from above as @xmath150 for both choices of @xmath151 . near @xmath152",

    ", it corresponds to @xmath24 everywhere with a dirac monopole in the gauge sector . in the latter case",
    ", the dirac monopole does not generate any measurable quantity , since all conserved quantum numbers we considered above vanish for this configuration .",
    "only if there is an electric charge that couples to the gauge field directly ( say , via minimal vector - current coupling ) , can there be physical consequence of this monopole solution . in the context of unstable d - brane",
    ", no such charged particle is known to exist .",
    "in this note we considered static tubular solution in unstable d3-brane decay with an ansatz that involves both d0 charge and fundamental string charge .",
    "a series of both smooth and singular solutions are obtained and compared to supertube configuration of d2 .",
    "while for a specific choice of potential there exists a smooth bps - like solution , for generic choice of potential , one must take a singular limit to find supertube solution .",
