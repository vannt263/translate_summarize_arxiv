    "the dominant component in the spectra of x  ray binary pulsars is usually well described by a hard power - law model with an exponential cut - off , sometimes with fe k@xmath7 emission lines .",
    "however , at low energies several sources show a significant excess over the main power - law , which has been described with different models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an overview ) .",
    "although various physical processes have been invoked to produce it , its origin is still unclear .",
    "@xcite showed that the origin of the _ soft excess _",
    "is related to the source total luminosity and that a spectral component of this type has been detected in all the x  ray pulsars with a sufficiently high flux and small absorption .",
    "in fact , most of the soft excess sources are at small distances and/or away from the galactic plane .",
    "this suggests that the presence of a soft spectral component could be a very common , if not an ubiquitous , feature intrinsic to x  ray pulsars .",
    "since the study of the soft part of the spectrum in galactic sources is affected by the interstellar absorption present in the galactic plane , the best sources to study this feature are the transient pulsars in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "they can reach high luminosities ( @xmath8 erg s@xmath3 ) , are at well known distances , and , thanks to the low absorption in the mcs direction , can provide high - statistics spectra at low energies .",
    "in particular , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) hosts more than 100 be / x  ray binary systems , about 70 of which show periodic pulsations ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most interesting pulsars in the smc is , also known as sxp  2.76 , which was discovered in 1993 by  @xcite . a be type star was found in its error region and proposed as a candidate counterpart @xcite .",
    "optical photometry of this star revealed a periodicity of 82 days , likely related to the orbital period of the system ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the rosat x  ray spectrum of  was unusually soft , consisting of a low temperature black - body component ( @xmath9 = 35 ev ) plus a steep power - law ( photon index @xmath10=2.4 ) .",
    "the presence of a soft excess was confirmed by a simultaneous @xmath11 observation , which also detected x - ray pulsations with a period of 2.76  s @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous analysis of the  and  data showed that the soft component could be described with either emission from a thin thermal plasma ( @xmath9=0.37  kev ) or a broken power - law , while a hard power - law ( @xmath10=0.43 ) described well the spectrum above 2 kev .",
    "both components had a phase  averaged luminosity of @xmath110@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ( 0.110 kev ) : the hard component dominated above 2 kev and showed sinusoidal pulsations with a pulsed fraction of @xmath137% , while no pulsations were detected in the soft component , which dominated below 1 kev @xcite .    after the 1993 observations , no other bright outbursts were seen from   until 2013 , except for two detections of the source with pca @xmath12 in september 2002 and in november 2004 reported by @xcite .",
    "the 2013 outburst was discovered with the @xmath13 instrument , which detected the source starting from december 26 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bat ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "a couple of weeks later ,   monitoring observations of the smc confirmed the bright status of the source @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of this outburst , we triggered our  target of opportunity program aimed at investigating the soft excess in high luminosity be / x  ray transients ( hereafter be / xrts ) thus obtaining an observation of   in march 2014 .",
    "here we report the results of this observation .",
    "was observed by  between 2014 march 14 and 15 , for a net exposure of @xmath119  ks ( see table  [ tab : log ] for the observation log ) . in fig .",

    "the be transient  in the smc attracted attention because , like a few other x  ray pulsars , it showed a prominent soft excess , the origin of which is still uncertain @xcite .",
    "two were the main alternatives discussed by hickox et al . to explain the soft excess in : either reprocessing of x ",
    "rays in the inner region of an accretion disc or optically thin , hot thermal emission .",
    "thanks to the large collecting area of , the observation obtained during the recent new outburst of , allowed us to perform a more detailed study of this source , even if its luminosity of l@xmath14=7@xmath1510@xmath16  erg  s@xmath3 ( 0.510 kev ) was a factor @xmath13 smaller than that observed in the 1993  and   data @xcite .",
    "the new period value , p@xmath4=2.762383(5 )  s , implies an average spin - up rate of @xmath5  s @xmath6 in the @xmath120 years between the two outbursts .",
    "this spin - up value is probably not representative of the true torques currently acting on the neutron star , since during the long time interval between the two outbursts , the pulsar could have been spinning - down , at least for part of the time . with the reasonable assumption that an accretion disk is present during the observed outburst , we can discuss the results in the framework of the @xcite theory of accretion torques .",
    "for a given neutron star mass , radius , and dipolar magnetic field , the spin period derivative , @xmath17 , is expected to scale as @xmath18@xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the spin period , @xmath21 is the x  ray luminosity ) . assuming @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24  erg  s@xmath3 , @xmath25 the expected spin - up rate for  during the  observation is @xmath17@xmath1@xmath26  s @xmath6 ( eq .",
    "15 in @xcite ) . as expected , this value is larger ( by a factor of @xmath150 ) than the time averaged spin - up rate between 1993 and 2014 .    although the pulsed fraction observed in 2013 ( @xmath27  % ) was smaller than in 1993 ( 37% ) , the large number of counts collected by the three epic cameras allowed us to see interesting variations of the pulse profile as a function of energy that were not evident in the previous observations .",
    "the pulse profile is double - peaked at intermediate energies ( 0.54 kev ) and for the first time pulsations were seen also below 0.5  kev . in principle , the presence of pulsations in the soft energy range might give some information on the origin of the soft excess ( see below ) , but in practice this is complicated by the fact that both the soft excess and the hard power law contribute to the counts in this energy range and could be responsible for the observed modulation .",
    "our observation confirms the presence of a soft excess in .",
    "its 0.212 kev spectrum could be well fitted by a double - component continuum with a hard cut - off power - law ( @xmath10@xmath10.44 ) together with a soft excess equally well modelled by either a soft black - body ( kt@xmath10.1 kev ) , or a hot thermal plasma model ( kt@xmath10.2 kev ) .",
    "while these spectral parameters are similar to what found in 1993 , the relative contribution of the soft component to the total luminosity was much lower in 2014 : the 0.110  kev luminosities of the soft and hard spectral components were l@xmath28=10@xmath29  erg  s@xmath3 and l@xmath30=7.1@xmath1510@xmath16  erg  s@xmath3 in 2014 , while they were l@xmath31=8@xmath1510@xmath16  erg  s@xmath3 and l@xmath32=1.8@xmath1510@xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 in 1993 , implying a soft to hard luminosity ratio of 1.5% ( in 2014 ) instead of 44% ( in 1993 ) .",
    "we discovered several features in the  spectrum : narrow lines from ionized oxygen and nitrogen ( in the rgs data ) , a broad feature at 0.9 - 1 kev , likely produced by fe - l shell emission ( both in the rgs and epic data ) , and an iron emission line at @xmath16.6  kev .",
    "the latter is clearly evident in the time - averaged spectrum .",
    "there is some evidence that its centroid energy varies as a function of the pulsar spin phase , but the significance of the line is marginal ( @xmath33 ) when it attains the highest energy .",
    "we detected a phase dependence of the cut - off energy ( from @xmath34@xmath120  kev to e@xmath35@xmath3645  kev ) , which is the main responsible for the spectral variability with the spin phase .",
    "a similar behavior of high - energy cut - off is unusual in x  ray pulsars ( an example is the low - mass x  ray binary pulsar 4u 1626 - 67 , @xcite ) .",
    "we observed also a phase dependence of the flux contributed by the broad emission component at 0.9 - 1 kev , that can be explained by a variable emitting area illuminated / photoionized by the pulsar beam .",
    "an accretion disc is a natural reprocessing site for the x - ray emission emitted from the accreting pulsar , especially when its luminosity is high ( @xmath37  erg  s@xmath3 ) and photons preferentially escape in a fan - beam from the accretion column ( e.g. @xcite ) , favouring an x  ray illumination of the equatorial regions .",
    "following @xcite , we can assume that black - body emission with luminosity l@xmath38=@xmath39 @xmath40 ( where @xmath40 is the total x  ray luminosity ) results from reprocessing by optically thick material located at a distance @xmath41 and subtending a solid angle @xmath39 with respect to the central x - ray source .",
    "independent on the exact geometry of the reprocessing region , the distance @xmath41 can be estimated from the relation @xmath42 ( note that this is different from the radius ( @xmath43 ) resulting from the normalization of the black - body component in the spectral fit ( tables  [ tab : av_spec ] and [ tab : bbpow ] ) ) .",
    "if the reprocessing region is a shell at the inner edge of the disc , @xmath41 should be of the order of the magnetospheric radius , @xmath44 ( or of the corotation radius if the pulsar is rotating close to the equilibrium period ) . adopting the  phase - averaged luminosity l@xmath14=7@xmath1510@xmath16  erg  s@xmath3 ( 0.510 kev ) and the black - body temperature , @xmath45 , of 0.09  kev ( table  [ tab : av_spec ] )",
    ", we obtain a distance @xmath4610@xmath47  cm , which is indeed very similar to the corotation radius @xmath48=3.3@xmath1510@xmath47  cm .",
    "an estimate of the magnetospheric radius @xcite can be obtained from the relation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the neutron star ( ns ) mass in units of solar masses , @xmath51 is the ns radius in units of @xmath52  cm , @xmath53 is the x  ray luminosity in units of @xmath54  erg  s@xmath3 , @xmath55 is the ns magnetic field in units @xmath56  gauss . if for  we assume @xmath55=1 we obtain @xmath44@xmath110@xmath47  cm . if the soft excess is caused by reprocessing of the x - ray pulsar emission by the inner edge of the accretion disk , some pulsations in the soft part of the spectrum are expected , as indeed it was found . in this scenario ,",
    "the narrow lines we discovered at low energies in the rgs spectrum and the ionized iron line at 6.6  kev can be produced by a plasma located in the disc atmosphere .",
    "they require the presence of matter with very different ionizations stages .",
    "indeed , while plasma with highly ionized oxygen and nitrogen is characterized by a ionization parameter @xmath57@xmath1100  erg  cm  s@xmath3 ( @xmath57=@xmath21/@xmath58@xmath59 , where @xmath21 is the luminosity of the ionizing source , @xmath60 is the plasma density , @xmath41 is the distance of the photoionized matter from the ionizing source ) , the presence of highly ionized iron fe@xmath61xxv implies @xmath57=1000  erg  cm  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the widths we derived for the n@xmath61vii and o@xmath61viii ly@xmath7 lines are larger than the rgs energy resolution and imply velocities of @xmath11,000 - 2,500  km  s@xmath3 for the emitting plasma , as expected for matter rotating at distances of a few @xmath1510@xmath62  cm from the neutron star . given the high x ",
    "ray luminosity , the presence of the accretion disc , and the detection of narrow lines from matter with very different ionization stages not compatible with a single plasma temperature , we can interpret the soft excess as the result of reprocessing from the inner edge of the disc and the narrow lines as due to photoionized plasma in regions above the disc .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the soft excess in  is entirely emitted by a thermal hot plasma @xcite .",
    "using a mekal model to fit the rgs spectrum , we could account well _ only _ for the o@xmath61viii ly@xmath7 emission line , which we interpret as a further indication of the presence of photoionization , and obtained a metal abundance ( @xmath63 @xmath64 ) too low for the smc . the emission measure obtained from the normalization of the mekal model",
    "is @xmath65  @xmath66 .",
    "since the gas density in this case should be @xmath67  @xmath66 , the emitting spherical region for the optically thin plasma should have a radius @xmath68 cm , and no pulsations in the soft excess are expected .",
    "@xcite found wavy structures below 1  kev in their  plus  spectrum and explained them with the presence of a deep edge - like structure at 0.5  kev , caused by an over - abundance of neutral oxygen ( about 6 times solar ) in the circumstellar matter .",
    "however , this was at odds with the very low metal abundance ( 0.02 solar ) in their best - fit thermal plasma model .",
    "these authors concluded that the oxygen over - abundance is real , while the mekal model is un - physical .",
    "also our  spectrum showed wavy structures below 1 kev , which we fitted with a broad gaussian line at @xmath10.96  kev , but we found no evidence for a neutral oxygen edge at 0.54  kev deeper than the one ascribable to the best - fitting n@xmath69 .",
    "we note that acceptable fits to the epic spin - phase selected spectra adopting a single absorption model with variable metal abundances ( vphabs in xspec ) could be obtained _ only _ deleting the gaussian component at 0.96  kev",
    ". however , in this case , an oxygen overabundance around 30 times solar was obtained , which we think is unlikely . moreover , the resulting column density was very low ( @xmath15@xmath15@xmath70  @xmath71 ) , one order of magnitude lower than the galactic one .",
    "if , instead , we use two absorption models , one for the galactic absorption ( phabs ) and one with variable abundances for the smc absorption ( vphabs ) , the column density of the latter becomes compatible with zero and the fit is insensitive to the metal abundances .",
    "given that the neutral oxygen edge falls within two bright emission lines in the rgs spectrum ( n@xmath61vii and o@xmath61viii ) , we believe that the edge - like structure at 0.5  kev observed by @xcite was due to the low spectral resolution of the  plus  spectra and to the presence of the nearby emission component at 0.9 - 1  kev .",
    "a hint of an absorption line at 7.5  kev was present only in a narrow range of spin phases ( @xmath72@xmath73=0.7 - 0.8 ) . since its energy is not consistent with any known line feature ( except for the k@xmath74 line from neutral ni at 7.48  kev , which we consider very unlikely , given the highly ionizing flux from the x  ray pulsar ) , it is tempting to associate it with a cyclotron resonant scattering feature . in this case ,",
    "its energy would imply a magnetic field in the scattering region of 6.5@xmath15(1+z)@xmath1510@xmath75  g , where z is the gravitational redshift .",
    "the main results of our  observation obtained during the second bright outburst from the smc be / xrt   can be summarized as follows :    * the continuum x  ray spectrum is complex and requires several components : a hard power law with a phase - dependent high - energy cut - off , a soft excess below 0.5 kev well fit by a black - body model , and a broad emission feature at @xmath10.9 - 1  kev .",
    "* we discovered narrow emission and absorption lines from oxygen , nitrogen and iron in different ionization stages . *",
    "the relative contribution of the soft excess component to the total luminosity was smaller than in the 1993 observations ( 1.5% wrt 44% ) , when the source was a factor @xmath13 brighter . *",
    "contrary to what observed in 1993 , the pulsar pulse profile was strongly energy - dependent and pulsations were detected also below 0.5  kev .",
    "the pulsar spin period of p@xmath4=2.762383(5 )  s implies an average spin - up rate of @xmath5  s @xmath6 in the @xmath120 years elapsed after the only other period measurement of this source .",
    "these findings lead us to interpret the soft x - ray excess in this source as due to reprocessing of the pulsar emission from ( part of ) the inner edge of the accretion disc at a radius of @xmath76 cm .",
    "the disc inner boundary is consistent with a magnetic field of the order of 10@xmath77 g which could also explain the possible absorption feature at 7.5  kev as an electron cyclotron line .",
    "the observed narrow lines are most likely produced by photoionization of plasma located above the inner regions of the accretion disc .",

    "source counts in mos2 timing mode were initially extracted from rawx=290 to rawx=321 , resulting in a count rate @xmath15  count  s@xmath3 .",
    "background was taken from an outer ccd that collected data in imaging mode . when compared with the spectra extracted from the other cameras , mos2 spectrum showed a significant deficit of counts above 7 kev , a shortage becoming much less evident when extracting counts from a box excising the central columns of the psf ( that peaks at rawx=305 ) .",
    "we extracted different spectra from boxes with a variable number of excluded inner columns . for each box region , we also tried different pattern ( single - pixel events or single and double events ) , but this led to a marginal difference in the resulting spectral shape in the energy range 0.610 kev .",
    "we followed the procedure recommended on the  sas user guide ( issue 10.5 , updated to 2014 , february 7 ) available at http://xmm2.esac.esa.int/docs/documents/ to properly calculate the effective area associated with a spectrum extracted from the box in mos2 , from which the core columns have been excised . comparing these several different mos2 spectra , and fitting them with a simple power law model , we found significantly different slopes , even when restricting the spectral analysis to the safer energy range 2 - 7 kev .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is unclear ( we did not find anything similar reported in the sas user guide ) . in principle",
    ", the count rate is too low ( @xmath15  count  s@xmath3 ) to cause possible pile - up problems in mos2 , although the use of the sas task epatplot on mos2 events ( for both the whole spatial rawx region and the different boxes chosen ) showed a significant discrepancy in the distributions of observed and expected event shapes in the energy range 0.5 - 2 kev , while apparently no problems were found above 2 kev .",
    "we also noted a significant electronic noise in mos2 image ( time versus rawx ) , with a reapeting pattern in rawx ( several equally spaced `` hot rawx columns '' ) , appearing only below 0.5  kev .",
