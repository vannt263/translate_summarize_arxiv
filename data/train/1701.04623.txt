    "the system is governed by the incompressible navier - stokes equation and an advection - diffusion equation of the temperature perturbation , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the velocity field , @xmath19 is the modified pressure , which includes the centrifugal potential , and @xmath20 is the temperature perturbation relative to @xmath14 .",

    "this dynamic system is modeled in a 3 step process .",
    "first , for each set of @xmath27 , the linear onset of convection @xmath28 and the associated eigenmode are computed precisely by using the ` singe ` code @xcite to find the value of @xmath2 for which the least damped eigenmode of the linearized equations has almost zero growth rate ( see supplementary table [ tab : crit ] ) .",
    "the linear eigenmodes are then used as initial values of fully 3d simulations , which are then run until they reach a statistical equilibrium .",
    "hysteresis cycles and subcriticality are explored by changing the thermal forcing or rescaling the final flow state and evolving the system to its new equilibrium .",
    "the fully three - dimensional simulations are run with our spherical code ` xshells ` , that solves the equations on a discrete radial grid using second order finite differences , in combination with spherical harmonic expansions .",

    "the code has been validated against full - sphere convection @xcite .",
    "most runs employ a form of hyper - viscosity affecting only the 20% highest wavenumbers @xcite to ensure spectral convergence , but we have checked that this does not alter the solutions , especially in the subcritical regime .",
    "similarly , careful spatial and temporal convergence checks have been made , and we were surprised to find that the amplitude of the zonal winds ( axisymmetric azimuthal flow ) is very sensitive to the bulk radial grid spacing , although no sharp gradients were seen . as a result",

    "as fig .  [ fig : subcrit ] shows , subcritical convection exist in our system , as convection on the strong branch can occur below the linear onset of convection , at @xmath65 .",

    "this is indicated by the open symbols below @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : subcrit ] ) , where the flow transitions to rest because of its intrinsic fluctuations , sometimes after several thermal diffusion times .    a much more robust subcriticality is observed at @xmath67 and @xmath47 .",
    "there , the strong branch can be violently perturbed without loosing the convection . as an example",
    ", we can divide flow and temperature anomalies by 10 at @xmath68 and the convection will quickly recover , while dividing instead by 100 sends the system back to rest . by gradually lowering @xmath2 ,",
    "we have observed robust convection at decreasing @xmath2 down to @xmath69 and lost the convection at @xmath70 , when the pclet number dropped below @xmath71 .",
    "further stress test were applied at @xmath68 .",
    "we artificially removed all @xmath32 ( axisymmetric ) components , including the zonal flow and zonal temperature anomaly : the convection stayed firm .",
    "we also kept only the most unstable mode at onset and its harmonics : the convection endured .",
    "these numerical experiments highlight the key role of the pclet number here .",
    "because it is much larger than @xmath72 at the linear onset ( @xmath73 ) , it is possible to have convection at @xmath2 well below @xmath74 , as long as @xmath75 .",
    "below that threshold , the strong branch of convection can not survive .",
    "our study also shows the trend of lower and lower subcritical @xmath76 as @xmath77 is reduced while keeping @xmath78 .",
    "this suggests an even larger effect at planetary core conditions ( @xmath79 ) , currently out of reach for numerical models .",
    "subcriticality , like hysteresis , implies the presence of active nonlinearities . the zonal flow in this system is produced by non linear interaction of the convective velocity ( reynolds stress ) . in fig .  [ fig : strongscaling ] we plot the @xmath80 as a function of @xmath81 over the full set of simulations carried out .",
    "the data points seem to align to an inertial scaling law with a power of 3/2 @xcite .",
    "this scaling law persists not only between the different @xmath1 and @xmath0 numbers , but between the strong and weak branches as well .",
    "a set of subcritical runs were rerun with their zonal components artificially canceled ( set to zero at every time step ) with no significant change in the convective flow or core temperatures .",
    "these two factors combined show that the zonal flow is only ever a byproduct of the convective flows and not a driver of any of the dynamics .",
    "instead the @xmath82 criterion suggests that the nonlinear term in the heat equation , @xmath83 , is the cause of the observed subcriticality .     of the flows as a function of the averaged convective velocity @xmath81 .",
